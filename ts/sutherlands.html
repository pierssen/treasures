<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span> in Whitsun-week, 1760, was no way inferior in
point of sunniness and softness, to the Tuesday in Whitsun-week,
1860; indeed, as the past must always win "a glory
from its being far," perhaps it may safely be said to have
been a sunnier and softer day than any we can find in the
long string of "now-a-days" through which our own experience
reaches. There can, however, be no one to contradict
the assertion that it was soft and sunny; it cannot possibly
be proved that there was a cloud in the May sky, or
that the sun went down with anything between him and the
green earth but the faintest, lightest veil of haze, or that
the tall poplars by the roadside did not throw their long
shadows over greener fields than 1860 has seen, or is likely,
with its drought and heat, to see; or that the hawthorn
hedges were not thick with blossoms, or the air sweet with
sweetest flowers of early summer: it has won at least

<!-- page 10 -->

that glory from its being far, that no one can deny or disprove
whatsoever may be said in its praise.</p>

<p>The parish church of Borringdon overlooked the village;
the eminence on which it stood was but a slight one, to be
sure, but from the church porch, when the trees in the
churchyard were not in too full leaf, one could see at the
left, the last straggling cottage on the broad village street,
as it terminated at the entrance of Hiltonbury Park, and on
the right, the winding of the river that cut it short on that
hand. English villages can hardly help being pretty,
even in these steam-factory days; but in those, when the
enterprise of a whole parish could vent itself in a trio of
mills on the stream that wound through it, and beat out its
strongest throes under the low shed of the village blacksmith,
it is easy to imagine how much of picturesqueness
and beauty the repose and ruralness added. And on that
particular evening, the village of Borringdon lay so quiet
under the quiet sunset sky, that any part of it, seen from
any point, would have made a pretty picture, and necessarily
the whole, seen from the grey church porch, with the
thick shade of the yews, and the dark stone church itself for
a background, was fair and peaceful and picturesque in the
extreme.</p>

<p>Evening service was just over; the slender congregation
passed out and down the hill. Slender the congregation
was on week-days, even then; highdays and holydays, weddings
and funerals, saw the church well filled with the well-dressed,
decent, church going farmers and villagers of the
neighborhood; but the piety that can consecrate each day,
instead of each Sunday, to the Lord of them all&mdash;the piety

<!-- page 11 -->

that acknowledges no duty more binding than religious
duty, no pleasure dearer than the pleasure of pleasing God,
was rare, even then and even there. The parish school
children, very glad to be released, bounded down the hill,
the parish school teacher soberly followed, very glad too,
perhaps; three or four old men, and half a dozen sad-looking
women came out slowly, the peaceful service just
ended within, finding its continuance in the peaceful scene
without. What quiet, subdued faces those were! Through
age and poverty and plainness, the light within shone out;
they had learned the great lesson of self-abasement, of real
renunciation of the world; they had learned of Him who
was meek and lowly in heart, and they had found rest unto
their souls.</p>

<p>A very different expression the face of the young lady
wore who came out last, in her soft pink muslin dress and
rose-colored ribbons, holding her fan and Prayer-book in
her hand. She was handsome and spirited-looking, and her
dark-brown eyes had much thought in them; but a shade of
impatience and restlessness marred their light, and robbed
her fine mouth of half its beauty. She stopped a moment
in the porch; it was strange that the sight of the sweet
picture framed in its dark walls, did not carry into her soul
something of its own peace. But it rather seemed to stir a
conflict there, to rouse, by its contrast, all manner of unrest.</p>

<p>Hers was not a face that told of much discipline; one
would say she had had hardly any Past, hardly any pleasures
that she valued, hardly any sufferings that she had not
made for herself. But the sufferings that we make for ourselves
are not unfrequently our severest sufferings; God is

<!-- page 12 -->

much more merciful to us in the way of discipline than we
are to ourselves. Here was a pleasant, smooth, sunny life,
perfectly free, so far, from any outward trial, steadily sheltered,
prosperous and peaceful, but withal this girl had
contrived to find no peace in it. The truth was, she was
trying to do something quite beyond her power, to wit, get
it right between serving God and loving the world. The
strong religious instincts of her nature, the influences of her
education, the stern rules of duty she had early learned, all
held her in the path she recognized as right, but only by
constraint, self-imposed but galling, only because she dared
not leave it for the one she longed for. The "tinsel melodies
of earth" were drowning the only music that could
have satisfied such a soul as hers, the restlessness of ambition
was driving away the peace that hovered, scared,
above it. The church-going, the duty-doing, in which she
was so faithful, these were but the body of her religion; the
soul had not been breathed into it, the soul of love that
would have given it a life, that would have transformed its
cold obedience into living warmth.</p>

<p>"We shall miss you much. Miss Georgy," said old Richard
Evartson, holding open the gate for her. "You go to-morrow,
they tell me at the Lodge."</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow morning," she replied. "I shall leave
some books for you with Adam; you can send Letty for
them any time you choose. I am sorry I could not bring
them up to you myself."</p>

<p>"You are too kind, miss; I am very grateful. 'Tisn't
many young ladies going up to London their first year
would think about the books an old man such as me would

<!-- page 13 -->

want. But you were always different, Miss Georgy. I
wish you may enjoy yourself among the gay people up
there, and have all the pleasure you're looking for. There's
a great many wishes it besides me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Richard," she said rather hurriedly, passing 
out of the gate. "I don't know whether I look for
much pleasure, but I hope it won't hurt me. Good bye."</p>

<p>"What is that Richard is wishing you?" said some one
beside her, whom she had seen coming, for she did not look
up, or seem surprised, only answered, as they walked on
together:</p>

<p>" 'All the pleasure I'm looking for.' How much is that,
do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"It is beyond me to conjecture, I'm afraid. You are
going to-morrow, it is settled, then?"</p>

<p>He looked at her for the first time, as he spoke, for an
instant keenly, and the half hope that flashed through his
eyes faded at her indifferent "yes." Indifferent, no doubt,
he thought it; he was apt to think she knew how to use no
other tone to him. Proud people are sadly at the mercy
of their pride, and can see nothing but as it dictates.
Georgy's face was not so perfectly indifferent as was her
tone, or she never would have turned it away so quickly,
and looked so intently across the river as they reached the
bridge. There was nothing very novel in the river's flow
that afternoon. The willows leaned over it, and dipped
their drooping foliage in the water, the light breeze streaked
it here and there with dark blue ripples, the sinking sun
reddened and gilded it, the shadow of the bridge lay deep
and still upon it&mdash;but Georgy knew all its moods by heart,

<!-- page 14 -->

and was not thinking of it then, for all her earnest
gaze.</p>

<p>The path they were following lay along the river's bank,
through what was called the Willow Walk, where the thick
row of trees on one hand leaned over into the Briarfield
pasture-ground, and on the other drooped down into the
water, almost meeting overhead. Their talk, to a casual
listener, would have seemed just the indifferent, unstudied
talk of boy and girl&mdash;children who had sailed boats on this
same stream together, and fished for minnows in it, as far
back as their memories extended&mdash;who were too nearly of
an age, and had been too intimately associated, to be careful 
of the impression they made upon each other by the
words they used or the sentiments they acknowledged: but
to one bent upon going below disguises, there would have
been something in Georgy's averted eyes, and half uneasy
manner, that would have suggested a doubt, if her companion's 
face had told no tales.</p>

<p>At a first glance, it was difficult to determine Warren
Sutherland's age. He looked almost a boy, but there was
a depth of thought in his grey eye, an intellectual refinement 
about the very exquisite beauty of his face, that
belonged more to the man than to the boy. Something had
developed him early&mdash;something had hurried him out of
boyhood long before boyhood's healthy pleasures were
exhausted. He had now, though but just of age, and hardly
a year older than his companion, gained upon her all the
distance that is generally accorded to her more rapidly
maturing sex, and somewhat besides, perhaps. He was as
disciplined and self-controlled as she was the reverse. Yet

<!-- page 15 -->

one would have said, hers was the stronger nature of the
two&mdash;certainly the more impulsive, the intenser. What lay
beneath his proud reserve and quiet self-control, but few
had sounded; her strength, and perhaps her weakness, were
patent to the most careless observation.</p>

<p>Young Sutherland's face, though it had worn much the
same look for the last year, was sadder and more thoughtful 
that afternoon than Georgy had ever seen it before.
And well it might be. Hardly a fortnight had elapsed
since his father's death&mdash;hardly a fortnight was to intervene
before his own ordination, two things of moment enough to
sober any man. The old home to be broken up, a new one
to be found&mdash;change to come on things that had hitherto
seemed changeless, since he could not remember when they
had not been&mdash;the charge of his young sister&mdash;the new
responsibility&mdash;the sorrow that would be always new&mdash;these 
were making his heart heavy and his eyes sad. No
wonder Georgy looked away from them when she remembered 
the different sort of life that would open for her
to-morrow&mdash;the distance that it put between them; and no
wonder, either, that through it all those eyes haunted her
reproachfully&mdash;that she never could forget them&mdash;that she
never, in her life, forgot that walk through the Willows on
Whitsun-Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>"Then you have not yet decided what you and Laura
are to do," she said at last, abruptly, leaving unfinished the
commonplace subject that had just been occupying them.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, almost as abruptly, though in a
lower tone. "Nothing is decided yet. I cannot tell what
we shall do."</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>"There will not be any necessity for your leaving the
Parsonage, though, I am sure," she went on, giving him
a quick, inquiring glance. "You haven't thought of
that?"</p>

<p>Again he returned evasively that nothing was decided
yet.</p>

<p>"But," said the young lady, in the tone that was habitual
to her when there was any unusual emotion to be covered,
which emotion always covered itself with an unconscious
imperiousness, "there can be no doubt my cousin means to
give you the living&mdash;indeed, I have heard him say as much;
and in case he does, there can be no doubt about what you
ought to do."</p>

<p>"Can't there?" he said quietly, but with an emphasis
that brought the color to her face.</p>

<p>"I mean," she went on almost angrily, "I mean it doesn't
seem to <i>me</i> that there can be any doubt. Your plans, of
course, I don't know anything of, nor your wishes,
either; but I know Laura wants to stay. I know it would
be cruel to take her from the home she has always lived in,
and where we're all so fond of her. If you don't care at
all for yourself, I should think you would for her, and if my
cousin offers you the living, the least you can do will be to
accept it."</p>

<p>"And if Sir Charles offers it to me, it is just possible I
may not avail myself of it," he returned, with a cold, sharp
ring in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well, as you will," she said, with a shrug of the shoulders. 
"I'm sorry for Laura, that's all."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, but I think Laura will do very well.

<!-- page 17 -->

I am not sure that anything better than change of scene
could be devised for her. The Parsonage can never be the
same home to her again."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Georgy, in a softer tone. "But I
should think hers was a sadness that change could not help.
There are some griefs one cannot leave behind."</p>

<p>"Not leave behind, or lose sight of, but lighten for a
moment, possibly."</p>

<p>There was a pause, which Georgy broke by saying,
almost timidly:</p>

<p>"But you won't think of any change at present&mdash;not
before the autumn?"</p>

<p>"No; I hardly think there will be anything definite this
summer. Mr. Ralstone will be here till Christmas. You
will be away through July?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Georgy said, recovering her usual manner,
"through July, and possibly longer. There is some talk
of my cousins going over to Paris for a few months, and
they urge my going with them, but I doubt if mamma
consents. Though it will be such an advantage to me, I
cannot see why she should oppose it."</p>

<p>"An unspeakable advantage, certainly," he said carelessly.</p>

<p>"Of course it would; I never have been anywhere; never
have seen anything. Twenty years of my life wasted in
this dull place! You cannot blame me if I want to go.
You cannot wonder"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not wonder," said Warren. "I only wonder you
have been happy here so long. And as for blame&mdash;I long
to go away too much myself to blame you."</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>Georgy bent the fen she held in her hands impatiently.
"You can understand my feelings, then," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly, I believe," he returned.</p>

<p>The impatience of the hands that grasped the fan, at that
moment proved fatal to the pretty thing; it snapped sharply, 
and looking down confused and angry, she saw that she
had broken it quite in two, and with a quick gesture she
threw the fragments out upon the stream. The heavy
ivory half, fell with a plash some distance off, and sunk
almost as it touched the water, but the lighter part, cupids
and roses on gilt paper, lit nearer to the shore, and floated
uncertainly for a few moments, then yielded to the current,
drifted out into the stream, and downward slowly toward
the sea. Warren's eyes were fixed upon it as they walked
along; neither spoke for some minutes, till the young lady
rather hurriedly and awkwardly said, in a tone that was
meant to be indifferent and easy:</p>

<p>"That's too bad, Warren; that's the fan you gave me on
my birthday. Upon my word, I didn't mean to."</p>

<p>"Sir Charles will give you a finer, I have no doubt, if
you spend your next birthday in Paris," Warren said so
carelessly and coolly, Georgy hated herself for blushing at
his words. But, in truth, it was the first allusion he had
ever made to Sir Charles' evident and acknowledged admiration 
for her; till now she had fancied his jealousy lay too
deep for words, but she began to think perhaps there wasn't
any jealousy, and she had deceived herself.</p>

<p>"After all, he may not care," she thought, as they
emerged from the Willow Walk into the road again. A
few moments more brought them to a gate, which, while

<!-- page 19 -->

Warren held open, Georgy entered, saying, as he did not
follow, "Are you not coming in? You know it is my last
evening at home."</p>

<p>But Warren was not coming in, it appeared; he leaned
for a few moments on the gate, and Georgy, playing with
the sash at her waist, now that she had no fan to play with,
talked idly of the journey to-morrow, and of a hundred
other things of which she was not thinking. A sound of
wheels caught her ear, and glancing up, she said quickly:</p>

<p>"There's the Park carriage. Stay, Warren, and see my
cousins. Ah, Sir Charles is following on horseback, I see,"
she added, glancing quickly at her companion's face, and
blushing involuntarily.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me to them," he said, abruptly turning 
away. "I do not feel like meeting strangers just at
present. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night and good bye," said Georgy as she held
out her hand. He touched it for a moment, coldly and
lightly, hardly glancing into her face as he repeated his
good bye, and turned and left her.</p>

"What have I done?" thought Georgy, with a pang, as
she watched him walk rapidly across the road and enter
the Willow Walk. When he was with her, Georgy was
always wondering whether he cared for her, generally
concluding he did not, and she had been a fool ever to
think he did; the moment he left her the doubt left her
too; she had been a fool to be so blind, she knew he loved
her; there was nothing she could remember in all their
intercourse that did not go fully to assure her of it.</p>

<p>So, during the two minutes and a half that he was in

<!-- page 20 -->

right after he had said good bye, a strong rush of self-reproach, 
doubt, remembrance, came over her, and she
started forward and half pushed open the heavy gate, and
half called, "Warren!"</p>

<p>How cruel, how wrong to let him go so, even if they
were nothing but the merest friends&mdash;to be separated for
months, perhaps&mdash;and he in trouble, too. What would
Laura say. Oh, Laura had always thought that she was
worldly&mdash;but she wasn't; no, at that moment, if she had
been sure he loved her, if he had only used the power he
never guessed at, by reason of that blinding pride of his, he
could have won her from the worldliness he accused her
of, and which had kept them apart so long.</p>

<p>If he had once looked back, he would have seen the
whole story in her face and attitude; but he did not turn,
and with a half sigh she drew back, and let the gate
swing to again. What a grating, cold sound it had as it
fell into its place: "No, I won't be such a fool," thought
Georgy, bravely, glancing down the road at the approaching 
carriage with a resolute composure, but with a cold,
dull pain at her heart. "I'm glad he didn't hear; I'm
glad he's gone. It's better as it is."</p>

<p>The sunset was fading out of the sky; the faint opal lost
its hue almost as she gazed; and the tender grace of that
day was dead to her forever.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Georgy</span>, you should never wear anything but white
and cherry," said Lady Frances, looking at her cousin with
good-natured admiration.</p>

<p>"That's what I've been telling her," said Ellinor, the
younger sister, moving toward the piano, but looking up
again at the new comer after she had seated herself at it.
"It's just the thing for her complexion. I never saw her
look better than she does to-day."</p>

<p>"<i>Merci, mille fois, mesdames</i>," said Georgy, stooping
over Lady Frances, and kissing her lightly on the forehead.</p>

<p>The ladies were in the drawing-room at Portland Place,
awaiting the arrival of expected guests to dinner, and
Georgy sat down by the open window, fresh from a deliberate, 
successful toilet, and a luxurious idle pleasant day,
with the prospect of a delightful evening before her, with

<!-- page 22 -->

the consciousness of acknowledged beauty, the sense of
power, the certainty of success.</p>

<p>What a pleasant sort of place the world was, after all.
She began to wonder what made people so afraid of it.
She was sure, now that she was in it, she was just as good
as when she was at home. She never missed her prayers,
or forgot to read the Psalms, no matter what time she
came home at night, and she went out regularly to church
with her maid, long before her cousins were up in the
morning. She was quite certain all this showed she was
unhurt by what had formerly looked so dangerous, and she
was unconsciously sliding into a complacency and unconcern, 
as treacherous as new to her.</p>

<p>Her position at Portland Place certainly was a very
pleasant one. Lady Frances was young enough and
pleasure-loving enough to make her brother's house an
exceedingly agreeable one. Her father had died before
she was married, and she had only been a widow a year,
when her mother's death left vacant the place that she now
filled so well. Lady Frances being a clever, kind, easy-going 
person, had very cheerfully taken upon herself all the
responsibility that the care of her young brother, not yet
of age, and her little sister Ellinor, involved her in, having
good sense enough to know, the benefits conferred by the
position more than balanced the trouble that it brought.
It was a much better thing to be the mistress of Hiltonbury 
Park and the Portland Place house, than to be poor
Tom Osborne's widow, an unobtrusive member of her
father-in-law's by no means luxurious establishment.</p>

<p>To tell the truth. Lady Frances had not married very

<!-- page 23 -->

well, and though she had taken a good deal of pains with
Ellinor, Ellinor was not going to marry well either. It
would have made old Sir Harry growl thunder in his grave,
if he could have seen the sort of match his eldest daughter
had made, and the sort of matches his second daughter, and
his son and heir, proposed making. Ellinor was engaged to
marry a young German count, who had made love to her
the year before when they were abroad, who sang divinely
well, but who did nothing else, divinely or humanly
well, and whose possessions were as intangible as his
talents. And Sir Charles proposed marrying his cousin.</p>

<p>Lady Frances, being several years older than her
brother, and a good deal wiser, saw his folly, and did as
much as she could to prevent it. But it was not upon
record that any one had ever succeeded in preventing
Sir Charles from doing anything he had set his heart upon
doing, and upon marrying his cousin, he certainly had set
his heart. He came quite honestly by his self-will and self-indulgent 
temper, and entered openly upon that portion of
his inheritance long before he was of age, and even before
his predecessor had quitted the estate. If Sir Harry had
lived, "there would have been a tussle for it," as old
Richard said, before either would have given up, but the
chances were, the senior would have won the day, or at
least have held the younger one in check. Unfortunately
for the boy, however, he was left early with a field before
him, cleared of all hindrances to the indulgence of his self-will, 
and he grew up precisely the sort of man that might
have been expected. Sufficiently good-natured not to bully
when there was no need for it (and no one ever had less

<!-- page 24 -->

need), he just quietly did as he wanted to, always, under all
circumstances, making no account of the wills that died to
feed his, and keeping steadily in view his own advancement
and advantage.</p>

<p>The only one of all the womenkind at home who had
ever dared show any opposition to him, had been his
cousin Georgy, and this circumstance, together with her
beauty, and the resistance of his family, made him
thoroughly in earnest to obtain her hand. He never
doubted his success, such a doubt lay on the side of
absurdity; but there were just obstacles enough in the
path to give it a spice of adventure and to make it
acceptable to his <i>blas&eacute;</i> taste, palled with the too ready
submission of all around him. Mrs. Gregory, he knew,
could not long resist the temptation of seeing Georgy
mistress at Hiltonbury Park, however stoutly she might
oppose it now, on grounds of pride and conscience. For
old Sir Harry had been none too tender a kinsman, and
none too delicate in expressing his mind, and had said,
many years before, when the question of Georgy's being
educated at the Park with Charles and Ellinor, had been
raised and put down, the girl might have come, and
welcome, if she hadn't been so deuced good-looking; but
he'd seen enough of cousins being thrown together, and,
for the matter of that, he thought Margery Gregory had
too; and he only wished he might see his boy looking
once at any beggarly cousin, and he'd disinherit him before
he was a day older.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Gregory: there was more in that hit about
the cousins than met the ear. If what the local gossips said

<!-- page 25 -->

was true, she had been the first and firm choice of Sir
Harry's older brother, who was only stopped by death
from marrying her through all the opposition of his high-handed 
family. Sir Harry never forgave her the alarm she
had given them, and the narrow escape he had had; and
though, years after, when she was left a widow with one
child and a pinchingly small income, he had had the
humanity to offer her the rent of the Briarfield farm, he
never could quite overcome his suspicion and dread of her
as a dangerous and incendiary person.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, seeing how things had developed
in later years, there seemed more of the spirit of prophecy
in this apprehension of the old man's, than one would have
supposed could have resided in such a portly, plethoric
person, and such a beer-befogged intellect as his. At all
events, Sir Charles the younger was fallen into the same
snare that had involved Sir Charles the elder, and was
about to sacrifice all matrimonial ambition for the love
of his pretty, penniless cousin. Lady Frances had given
up all opposition long ago, and now furthered her brother's
suit very submissively, and made a great deal of Georgy,
partly with a dutiful view of pleasing him, and partly with
a prudential desire of propitiating the future Lady of
Hiltonbury. And as for Ellinor, she was in that stage of
romantic enthusiasm about her German lover, that she
would have despised any one who would have thought of
marrying sensibly and advantageously, and gave her
brother her most ardent sympathy, and lavished upon
Georgy all manner of endearments.</p>

<p>In this way the young lady's position in the family was

<!-- page 26 -->

made a very agreeable one, and one which she could not
well help enjoying. Not that she meant to marry Sir
Charles&mdash;at least not now, though it was very pleasant to
keep that fine picture of future glory in view and think of
it covertly; and not, either, that she had altogether forgotten 
Warren and the walk through the Willows on Whitsun-Tuesday 
evening; but, somehow, there was nothing very
much to call that romance into recollection, and it was not
quite convenient to think of it at Portland Place, where
there were so many other things to think of, and where it
seemed in a measure treasonable to think of it, when her
cousins did not know of its existence, in fact, thought her
head filled with a very different fancy. Besides, in a short
time she should be at Briarfield again&mdash;two weeks at farthest&mdash;if 
mamma did not consent to the Paris plan, and
then she could think as much as she pleased of it. So she
let herself be entertained and amused, and the days were
slipping away in a very delightful manner amid the fascinations 
of the gayest London society, till that eventful evening 
when Georgy came into the drawing-room early, looking
prettier than a picture, in cherry and white.</p>

<p>Sir Charles did not take her down to dinner himself, but
he delegated that office to a very safe person, to wit, his
much lauded friend, Mr. Edward Barclay, a young lawyer
of great promise just established in his profession; but of
so much more promise than performance, that no one could
accuse Sir Charles of temerity in allowing him Georgy's ear
and hand for that brief space. The truth was, Mr. Barclay
never had been, and never could be, a lady's man; good
looking, sensible and well-informed, he lacked whatever it

<!-- page 27 -->

is that makes a man a favorite among women; confidence,
perhaps, and a desire for their admiration, the quality that
is coquetry in a woman; and so he was overwhelmingly
popular with all young men, who took him enthusiastically
into the bosom of their families, and wondered loudly why
their sisters didn't fall in love with him, and introduced
him unhesitatingly to their <i>fianc&eacute;es</i>, and were sure that
their <i>fianc&eacute;es</i> would be bored.</p>

<p>Georgy's neighbor on her other hand, was a dull divine
who had in some way drifted into the current of the Portland 
Place hospitality, and not unfrequently enjoyed a meal
at its expense, whose taciturnity and tiresomeness had
passed into a proverb with the ladies, and at sight of whose
propinquity Georgy had made a well-bred, well-concealed
grimace at her cousin, and then had graciously begun to
entertain him. But with Mr. Barclay on one side, and
Dr. Drawl on the other, what wonder that her smiles soon
began to fail and her vivacity to flag? She took to listening
to the other people, and wondering at Sir Charles' spirited
conversation.</p>

<p>"He is cleverer than I thought," she pondered, as the
young host, feeling safe about her, blockaded as she was,
and seeing her half-admiring eyes turned from her stupid
neighbors to his face, grew clever and complacent, and
talked better than he had ever done before. Mrs. Erastus
Randall, a delightfully worldly, witty person, was keeping
him up to the effort, and Georgy, feeling she had done her
duty in trying to "make talk" with her neighbors, dropped
them altogether, and amused herself with the conversation
at the other end of the board.</p>

<!-- page 28 -->

<p>Dinner was more than half over, when, in a momentary
lull of talking, Dr. Drawl, who had been gathering himself
up for the effort for some time, said to his host in his slow,
strong voice, which boomed heavily across the temporarily
silenced table:</p>

<p>"That young man of whom you spoke to me some time
ago, I see by the papers, sailed yesterday. I suppose he
told you, I got him the appointment you wanted from the
Society. I had no trouble. The bishop thinks very well
of him."</p>

<p>There was nothing in the reverend gentleman's communication 
to excite any particular interest in Georgy's mind,
but there was something to excite it in her cousin's manner; 
he glanced involuntarily and uneasily toward her, and
hurried to change the conversation. What was it that he
did not want Dr. Drawl to talk about? But Dr. Drawl
saved her the trouble of much wonder on the subject, for
he had no mind to change the conversation: having been
all this while loading his gun, nothing should stop him
from firing it off.</p>

<p>"The venerable Society," he said, "have appointed him
catechist to the Indians and negroes in the vicinity of New
York, and assistant minister of Trinity Church. I should
have thought a living might have been obtained for him at
home, seeing he is a young man of very considerable
promise; but his mind seemed so set that way, and you,
sir, seemed so to desire his appointment to the mission,
that I did everything in my power to promote your
views."</p>

<p>"You are speaking of young Sutherland?" said Mr.

<!-- page 29 -->

Barclay, rousing, and looking across Georgy to the doctor,
who had now got fairly under weigh.</p>

<p>"The same," he answered. "Son of the late Rector of
Borringdon&mdash;a very old friend of mine."</p>

<p>"You can't mean Warren?" faltered Georgy, involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Warren&mdash;yes, it strikes me that is the name," he
repeated. "Warren&mdash;that was it, was it not, Sir Charles?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sir Charles faintly, "he has given up
the living I offered him, and gone to America. He has
relatives there, I believe."</p>

<p>"Warren Sutherland gone to America!" cried Ellinor.
"Why, how odd you never told us anything about it!"</p>

<p>"If you had as much to think about as I have, you
wouldn't wonder I forgot it," returned her brother, with
as much of a snarl as a man can allow himself at the
head of his own table, and with two rows of disinterested
eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"But where's Laura? What's become of Laura?" went
on Ellinor, with unfortunate curiosity.</p>

<p>"I can't say. I believe she's gone with him. I think
he told me she was going," said Sir Charles, doggedly
and with a lowering brow, for he had caught a sight of
Georgy's face.</p>

<p>"A trying voyage and a strange home for so young and
delicate a lady," Dr. Drawl resumed, by way of making
himself agreeable. "But the young man tells me she will
not consent to be separated from him, and as he has determined 
upon making the New World his home, it was
apparently the wisest plan for them to go together."</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>"She's a brave girl!" cried Mrs. Randall with a shiver.
"She hasn't my prejudice against scalping, I am sure."</p>

<p>"But when do they mean to return?" persisted Ellinor.</p>

<p>"Never, I fancy," returned the reverend doctor, comfortably. 
"He says they have no ties in England, that
they are going to make a home for themselves there. I
was quite interested in the young man."</p>

<p>"At any rate, Laura might have come to tell us good
bye, I think," said Ellinor.</p>

<p>At this moment Lady Frances made a hasty effort to
divert the talk into another channel, and succeeded in leading 
even the clumsy ecclesiastic after her.</p>

<p>Mr. Barclay, however, at home on the deserted subject,
and seeing perhaps that his neighbor was at home on it too,
turned to her and said:</p>

"You know Sutherland, then? He was a friend of mine
at Oxford; there wasn't a better fellow there. It's a burning 
shame he's gone off to bury himself in that dismal
wilderness; he has first-rate talents, and might have done
well at anything."</p>

<p>"Was his going sudden?" Georgy asked, but so low
Mr. Barclay had to ask her to repeat it.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I rather fancy it must have been.
I had a letter from him about ten days ago, saying he had
made up his mind to accept the appointment, and would
hope to see me in London at this time."</p>

<p>"And you saw him?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, several times. He was in the city nearly a
week. I went down to the ship yesterday to see him off;
and, upon my word, I never felt much worse. You see,

<!-- page 31 -->

Sutherland never has been very robust, and he looks
dreadfully now. And it's such a risky thing, such a
voyage as this, anyhow. Parting with a friend in that
sort of a way is all one with saying good bye to him forever&mdash;there 
isn't one chance to a hundred we'll ever meet
again. He never means to come back to England, and
nothing's further from my intention than going to America.
And that poor young lady, his sister&mdash;you know her. Miss
Gregory? She was as white as the wall. I saw it nearly
killed Sutherland every time he looked at her, but she
kept up wonderfully, and never shed a tear or gave way
in the least."</p>

<p>Georgy was very still through the hour that remained of
that long dinner, and sat silent, turning over the leaves of
a book during the time the ladies spent alone in the drawing-room; 
but just before the gentlemen came up, she
whispered some excuse to Lady Frances, and went out of
the room.</p>

<p>Sir Charles glanced eagerly and angrily around as he
entered, and Lady Frances felt a dull foreboding of evil as
she read his face; even Ellinor grew nervous and ill at ease
as she glanced at him. Georgy did not reappear, and
while Lady Frances presented her excuses as plausibly as
possible, she was in an agony till she should be free to go
to her. When at length her visitors departed and she
found herself at liberty to leave the drawing-room, she did
not wait for Sir Charles' sign, but hurried up to Georgy's
door.</p>

<p>Entering softly, she started to find a trunk dragged into
the middle of the room, and dresses thrown around as if a

<!-- page 32 -->

hasty departure were designed, while Georgy herself, lying
face downward on the bed, neither moved nor spoke when
she approached her, and repeated her name gently.</p>

<p>Sitting down by her on the bed, Lady Frances drew one
of the hands that were clasped above her forehead toward
her, and stooping over her, whispered:</p>

<p>"Why Georgy, child, what does this mean? What are
you doing? Why are your trunks out? Is anything the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Frances," said the girl, raising herself and speaking 
quickly, "I must go home&mdash;I must go to-morrow; you
must let me. Don't say anything against it. I shall die if
I can't get to mother. Oh, mother, mother!" And a
burst of sobs wound up the homesick cry of wretchedness.</p>

<p>"Why Georgy, darling," said Lady Frances, putting her
arm around her, and speaking soothingly, "I can't bear to
see you cry so. Tell me what it is. Perhaps I can help
you."</p>

<p>"Help me&mdash;oh!" And with a miserable groan she hid
her face again. Lady Frances had an uncomfortable apprehension 
of what the truth really was, and she almost
dreaded to hear Georgy's confession; so she only smoothed
back the heavy, fallen hair from her forehead, and spoke to
her caressingly, but not questioningly.</p>

<p>"You are a little homesick to-night," she said. "You'll
feel differently to-morrow. Let Janet come and put your
things away and undress you, and I will put on my <i>peignoir</i>
and come and sit by you till you get asleep. Your forehead 
is so hot; poor child! What could have brought on

<!-- page 33 -->

such a headache? Let me go and get something to bathe
your temples with."</p>

<p>But Georgy shook her head and said brokenly, "I don't
want anything. Don't send Janet; I don't want anybody
to come in the room. I can do everything myself. It's all
nearly packed."</p>

<p>"But, my dear child," said Lady Frances, uneasy lest
the idea of going home should get too strong a hold of her,
"but, my dear child, we cannot let you go. We shall
stupefy to death without you; you are the life of the house,
Charles thinks, and Ellinor and I can't possibly do anything 
right when you're away. And everything's so
pleasant now! There's Lady Bellenden's ball day after
to-morrow, and the opera, and Sir Arthur's dinner. Oh,
you can't go, Georgy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," she cried in agony, as if the very sound
was pain. "Don't&mdash;don't talk about those things. Oh,
how I hate them all! If I had never come&mdash;if I had only
stayed at Briarfield! Oh, I have deserved it all, but it is
too cruel! I can't&mdash;can't bear it!"</p>

<p>Her passionate wretchedness quite terrified her quiet,
unexcitable auditor; and, uncomfortable and uneasy, Lady
Frances said hesitatingly, "I'm very sorry for you. If
I only knew what made you so unhappy, perhaps I
could"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what it is that makes me so?"
exclaimed the girl, starting up and pressing her hand to
her forehead, while she spoke with a hurried vehemence of
manner and a terrible actuality of suffering that made
Lady Frances more than uncomfortable and uneasy. "Shall

<!-- page 34 -->

I tell you what I've done? I've killed myself&mdash;I've killed
my own happiness forever. I've just got to repent&mdash;repent&mdash;all 
my hopeless life. I've just got to go on, horrid
years perhaps, as deadly wretched as I am to-night;
remembering always that I've done it all myself, that my
worldliness has brought it on me; that I've given up the
man I love for a moment's vanity and folly that all eternity
can't cancel&mdash;all eternity can't bring me back. Oh! I've
thought I was serving God all this while&mdash;I never dreamed
how I was living. I see it all now&mdash;I never knew myself
before. Frances, did you ever feel as if you were going
mad? I feel so to-night. At the table, and till I got up
here, it was all like a dream. I don't think I knew at all
what anybody said or did. All I felt was, I must keep
myself from crying out or saying anything strange&mdash;must
be still and not think till I was by myself. Oh, Frances!
after that"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And, shuddering, she sank down by her cousin and hid
her face upon her shoulder. She had been all her life, in
exemption from suffering and in affectionate protection
from annoyance, such an entire child, that in this, her first
real vivid pain, though it hurried her into the sternest
stage of womanhood at one step, she still craved hungrily
the pity and caressing that had soothed childhood's troubles. 
Poor girl! she found that this pain went a little
too deep for such healing. She lay for a few minutes quiet,
with her cousin's arms around her, trying to listen to her
well-meant sympathy and to be comforted by its assurances; 
then, stung by some new phase of the trial that
had but just begun, and in which each day she lived she

<!-- page 35 -->

would discover some fresh sting, she started up, and with
her hands pressed before her face, paced hurriedly up and
down the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it cruel," she burst out, "isn't it unjust, that
for a sin not half intended&mdash;almost unconsciously committed, 
one should be punished a whole life-time?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Georgy," said Lady Frances, vaguely shocked at
her rebellion. "You know we must submit"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Submit!" she cried, her eyes flaming passionately;
"how can I submit to what is just a long horrible death&mdash;how 
can I submit never to see him again&mdash;never&mdash;never
to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, God help me!"</p>

<p>"Georgy, my child," said Lady Frances, anxiously,
"don't talk so, you'll feel differently in a little while about
it. It is natural you should feel so at first, but it will go
over by and by. Don't let anybody but me hear you&mdash;think 
how you'd feel to have anybody know it."</p>

<p>"I don't care who knows it," she exclaimed. "I don't
care what the world thinks now. I've cared too long. It
may know and gloat over what it has made me do. I've
done with it forever!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, child. Think of poor Charles, think how
wretched it would make him to hear all this."</p>

<p>"Sir Charles must never attempt to speak to me again.
I will never see him. I cannot bear to hear his name. I
am trying my best to forgive him, but he must never come
near me&mdash;it would kill me to see him. He must never
speak to me again."</p>

<p>"Georgy!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it. God knows I try not to hate him;

<!-- page 36 -->

you must tell him I prayed from the first minute to be able
to forgive him, and in time I know I shall; but he must
keep away&mdash;he must never let me see him."</p>

<p>"But Georgy"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it, Frances, and don't look so hurt.
You know I love you just the same&mdash;and you have always
been so kind! But I never could have married Charles,
even if he had not done this thing. I used to think about
it sometimes, and imagine I could learn to like him; but I
couldn't. I know I couldn't when it came to marrying
him, even if I had not known Warren. It was very
wrong to let you imagine there was any chance, very, very
wicked&mdash;but this is my punishment, and oh Frances, isn't
it hard enough! Don't be angry with me! Don't turn
away! Oh, you ought to pity me, you never suffered
anything like this! If I could only die."</p>

<p>And she flung herself upon the bed with a hopeless
misery that went to Lady Frances' heart, heavy as it was
now with forebodings of the storms that this must breed,
and of the painful scenes that this one was the precursor of.
How it would all end she did not dare to think: how Sir
Charles would bear the thwarting, even for a moment, of
his pampered will&mdash;what Georgy must pass through before
she submitted to it, she did not trust herself to fancy.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she thought with a sigh, as she left her
late in the night, quieter, either from exhaustion or submission. 
"She has a hard lot before her either way. Heaven
help her through it!"</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Supper</span> was late in being served to the men that evening
at the Sutherland farm: there had been a threatening of
rain about three o'clock, and all hands had been hurried
off to the thirty-acre lot below the creek, to help
bring in the heavy crop of hay that lay there; the great
wagons had come home groaning with its weight, and
now stood around the farmyard, mountains of promise
and future comfort to the patient beasts, who, released
and resting, were enjoying their well-earned meal in peace,
while their no less patient guides and counsellors were
enjoying theirs in the wide, low kitchen of the large stone
house that stood at the right of the farmyard and somewhat
elevated above it.</p>

<p>The threatening of rain had not been fulfilled, and the
sun had just gone down from a particularly unclouded
and finely colored sky, leaving the farmers in good temper
on account of to-morrow's promised haying, and the whole
landscape in a mellow, golden, luscious glow.</p>

<p>The negroes were evidently enjoying their supper: good,

<!-- page 38 -->

strong, likely men they were, too, fit to work such a farm
as Ralph Sutherland's, and no doubt they worked it well,
considering just the sort of master they had; for if the
neighbors knew anything about it, Ralph Sutherland's
negroes were the best fed, the best housed, and the hardest
worked in all the country round. At any rate, they were
having a good time of it that night, if they had had hard
work of it that day, and old Salome, ladling out a third
trencher of succotash from the great pot over the fire,
growled at them for their greediness, and they "he-he-d"
their low negro chuckle back at her from over their
replenished bowls.</p>

<p>Through the door that opened into the apartment
beyond, however, at this sound, there issued a much more
portentous growl, whereupon Salome, waving her ladle
threateningly, waddled over to the door, and shut it,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, ye noisy niggers! D'ye hear that? Ye'll
have the Massa 'bout yer years afore ye know it."</p>

<p>"And he's next worst to Slomy's ladle!" chuckled
Dave.</p>

<p>"No, no," snickered a lithe lad of twelve from the
hearth. "Massa's a heap worse'n Slomy. We could git
to the tavern'n back and git old Martin's porridge off his
fire 'fore Slomy'd got across the kitchen arter ye; but
Massa! he'd know what ye's at a'most afore ye knowed
yerself, and wouldn't he come down thwack!"</p>

<p>"Oh you&mdash;sarpint!" cried Salome, lunging at him across
the hearth in great wrath, for the young rascal had taken
the occasion of her journey to the door to replenish his

<!-- page 39 -->

bowl largely from the pot, and was now enjoying it
ostentatiously, stopping on his way to the table to take a
sip at it, dodging dexterously the heavy ladle, and swinging
himself round the corner and into his seat before it was
within reach of him again.</p>

<p>"O you chile of the Evil One hisself!" panted out
Salome, sinking into a seat beside the fire. "You take my
word for it, you'll come to grief yet."</p>

<p>"We'll be well off ef he don't take some of us along with
him," said Dave, looking half distrustfully at the impish
Indian boy, a third of whose lean, lithe body seemed at
this time to have disappeared into his bowl.</p>

<p>"Well, it does 'pear to me," said old Rube, and he was
the most conservative and temperate man at the table,
"that that 'ere Amen <i>is</i> the worst boy I ever come at yet.
What the Massa seed in him worth buyin' I never hev
foun' out."</p>

<p>"D'ye hear that, ye limb!" cried his neighbor, lifting
him up by the shoulder, and giving him a shake.</p>

<p>The truth was, Amen was far from popular among his
comrades. The master had purchased him about a year
before, at a bargain, from a Yankee preacher abroad on his
travels; whose travels were undertaken, Salome had
always maintained, for the simple purpose of getting rid
of the little imp he had succeeded in saddling them with,
and who, she was dead certain. "he'd have been glad to
have given away, ef Massa hadn't been such a tarnal fool
as to ha' bought him."</p>

<p>Besides his natural disposition, which was one calculated
to create a prejudice even in an unbiased mind, his Eastern

<!-- page 40 -->

extraction went very much against him among all the
slaves, for being strongly tinctured with the good old
Dutch conservatism of the neighborhood, they held in great
abomination that innovating and gouging crew who tenanted 
the adjacent States, and from nutmegs to niggers,
distrusted everything emanating from that quarter. Amen
was as bad as bad could be, however, and did not need this
prejudice to secure for himself the entire detestation of his
fellows, and, if the truth could have been arrived at, perhaps 
the slight disgust of his master&mdash;for in point of utility,
no one could deny, he wasn't worth his salt, and work to
the value of a dollar had never been got out of him in all
the year he had encumbered the Sutherland farm. But
Ralph was not the man to own up, even if he had been
taken in, and grumbled less at, and beat not much more
frequently, this sorry bargain than more valuable possessions.</p>

<p>Before supper was over. Amen had committed another
extravagance, and created another disturbance, which this
time was succeeded by the opening of the sitting-room
door, and the appearance of a slim, pretty looking mulatto
girl, who closed it carefully behind her, and holding up her
finger, said softly:</p>

<p>"You'd best take care, you Amen, and the rest o' you
niggers. Massa's awful riled to-night. He's swearin'
dreadful at the noise. Salome, any more cakes for Massa
Larry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Massa Larry, Maasa Larry! nothin' too good
for Massa Larry!" growled Salome, turning the last cake
of the griddleful she had been perfecting for him for the

<!-- page 41 -->

past ten minutes. "Nattee thinks if Massa Larry has his
full, taint no odds if we all starve on corn-cobs."</p>

<p>Nattee laughed a low laugh, and picking up the plate,
went back into the room with it, closing the door carefully
behind her, but giving an admonitory glance back upon the
feasters before she did it. The table on which she set the
plate was a well covered and abundant one, rather superfluously 
so, it might be thought, seeing only three people
sat down to it, but then two of the three were men fresh
from the hay-field, and one of them, Lawrence Sutherland,
the only child of Ralph, and the heir apparent of all this
comfortable estate, was such a tall, strong, broad-chested
fellow, that nothing that the table bore seemed too prodigal 
or too generous for him. He said, "Ah, Nattee!" in
a tone of satisfaction as she set the cakes before him, and
applied himself to them, as he did to whatever he undertook, 
with an honest good will and an unblushing appetite.
Nattee looked on with pleasure, while his mother watched
his every movement with a trembling affection that was
almost painful.</p>

<p>Indeed, though, it was not very wonderful she watched
him, he was a much pleasanter thing to watch than her
lord and master opposite. How such a thin, bent, grey,
ill-favored man, came to have such a fine, browned, well-made, 
manly-looking son, was subject of more legitimate
marvel. Larry's hair was light, and lay in short, loose
curls about his head, his eyes were blue, and his skin
smooth and fresh, though browned with much exposure to
the sun; his mouth was an exceedingly handsome mouth,
capable of a very fine smile; but when there was no smile

<!-- page 42 -->

upon it, there was something about its firm lines, as well
as about the steady look of the blue eyes, that suggested a
will that did not bear opposition, and the better part of
valor hinted the futility of dashing one's self against such a
rock as that, which, though it was not a frowning angry
ledge, but a clear, bold crystal, was still a rock for a'
that.</p>

<p>He was evidently a good son, though, for all his spoiling,
at least to his mother, for his voice was many tones softer
whenever he addressed her, and his manner had a sort of
half chivalrous, half affectionate protection. Mrs. Sutherland 
had probably been a beautiful woman in her youth,
but her youth lay many long years back in the past, according 
to the accepted signs, for her hair was very white, and
her figure slightly bent and trembling, but her eyes were
large, and brown, and soft, and her skin fresh as a girl's.
She was surely a very gentle woman, perhaps a woman
wanting in force of character, rather timid and undecided,
for there seemed a habitual flutter about her movements,
and a vague alarm in her soft eyes, that hardly ever left
them. Hers seemed an affectionate and trusting nature,
bent under a life-long bondage, dependent, from its gentleness, 
on some will at once tyrannical and rudely capricious.</p>

<p>She gave her directions to Nattee in a low, almost a
meek tone; she spoke to Larry more with her eyes than
her voice, but when she answered or addressed her husband, 
it was plain to see the struggle that eyes and voice
were involved in.</p>

<p>There was not much talking at the table that night.

<!-- page 43 -->

The master of the family, for some cause, was gloomier and
blacker than was his wont, and that is saying that he was
very gloomy and black indeed. Before the meal was over,
Nattee, by some hasty movement, was so unhappy as to
displease him, and he lifted his grizzled, bent head up from
his plate, and growled such a threat at her as sent her
trembling to the furthest corner of the room. Mrs. Sutherland 
tried not to look as if she pitied her, or was frightened
herself, but she looked both very unmistakably, and her
hands fluttered nervously about among the tea-things, without 
accomplishing anything but an exasperating racket,
which did not seem to soothe her husband; for raising his
head presently, he said, half turning toward the corner
where the girl stood trembling:</p>

<p>"Go down into the lot and catch Grey Dirck, and if he's
not saddled and ready for me by the time I'm ready for
him, I'll give you the thrashing you've been needing for a
month."</p>

<p>A look that was related to the look in Ralph Sutherland's
face, came into Larry's as this was said, but he was silent,
while his mother, startled into indiscretion, said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph! the men are nearly through their supper&mdash;let 
one of them go. Nattee can't manage Dirck, he's so
wild"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ralph fixed his eyes on her for a moment, and the sentence 
was never finished. Nattee shrunk noiselessly out of
the room, and not a word more was said. She did not go
through the kitchen, where the men still sat over their
supper, but out into the hall, and through the back door
into the yard. There was a cowed and frightened hesitation 

<!-- page 44 -->

about her that was a strange contrast to the lithe,
careless tread with which she had gone into the kitchen
fifteen minutes before. She was usually fearless and rapid,
much used to outdoor work, and often intrusted with the
entire care of the animals when the men were away in the
field, and she and Salome were the only servants left at
home. A very fearless horsewoman she had proved herself
hitherto, and her Indian blood, which made so good a cross
with the mulatto, had given her an intrepidity and skill
that rendered her as useful and dexterous as a man about
the farm, and nothing but her unusual cleverness and
tidiness in the house, and perhaps a little shame at so using
a woman, kept Ralph from employing her as a field hand
whenever there was need, and working her with the men.</p>

<p>But now, as she crept with cowardly and shrinking steps
down to the creek, she looked very far from dexterous or
intrepid, and as if she were totally incapable of the task
that had been put upon her. The creek was unusually high
for that season of the year, owing to the great rains that
had fallen recently, and the water looked deep and black
as she pushed the boat off upon it and struck it with her
oar. The sun had been down some time, and the sky was
growing so pale, she cast a fearful eye toward it; it might
take her half an hour to catch that horse, it would be dark
before she reached the house&mdash;and&mdash;but just then she
heard the branches on the bank crackle, and some one
sprang down upon the flat rock that ran out into the creek.
What if it were her master, angry at the time she had
already wasted? And half blind with terror and excitement, 
Nattee glanced toward the bank.</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>"Here, Nattee, I want to go across, come back," called
out Larry's voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Master Larry!" and she pulled back with a good
will.</p>

<p>Larry sprang in, and Nattee rowed across to the opposite 
bank of the little creek, while he stood thoughtfully in
the stern of the boat.</p>

<p>"You're not going for Dirck, Master Larry?" she said,
hesitatingly, as he sprang out. "Massa'll be dreadful
angry if you do."</p>

<p>He hardly gave her a look as he strode on across the
field, while she apprehensively and humbly, but very relievedly 
followed. Catching Dirck was never an agreeable
pastime, and one look at his fiery eyes accounted satisfactorily 
for Nattee's cowardice. He was as vicious a brute as
ever trod, and every movement, from the restless turning
of his abominable eye to the sharp strike of his heavy hoof
into the sod, told the story. Coming of the famous breed
of draught horses for which Ulster County was then so
famous, it was rather to be wondered at that Ralph Sutherland 
had reserved the best specimen of the kind he possessed 
for his own use instead of working him on the farm.
But for this, there were some reasons chargeable to his own
native perversity, and some more to the native perversity
of the animal himself. No attempt to drive him in harness
had ever been crowned with the slightest success; broken
heads and dashboards had resulted, but nothing of a more
satisfactory nature. He just submitted to the saddle, and
that was all; and after the first vexation of losing his services 
upon the farm, Ralph took a kind of savage pleasure

<!-- page 46 -->

in riding about among his neighbors on a horse whose
known attributes of ugliness, invested him, the rider, with
an added shade of rather questionable importance, but an
importance peculiarly acceptable to his peculiar disposition.</p>

<p>Nattee climbed up, in mortal terror, on the stone wall at
the lower end of the lot where Dirck was monarch, and
watched with apprehension the rare chase he was giving to
his pursuer. He was not monarch long, however; Larry,
though angry and determined, was light of foot and very
powerful, and in a few minutes Dirck's strong head was
writhing under the halter, and the whilom monarch was led
along an ungracious captive.</p>

<p>As Larry, now half soothed by his success, approached
the wall where Nattee stood, she involuntarily swayed herself 
backward in alarm, and almost fell; but in an instant,
by a quick gesture with her arms, recovered herself, and
kept her balance by clinging to the narrow ledge with her
soft, supple brown feet. Her young master did not often
look at her with half the interest that he looked at his setter 
Kelpie or his brown mare Bess, but this evening he
looked at her with much more; indeed, with a half surprised 
and involuntary admiration. For if Nattee had
chosen her attitude and surroundings with the skill of an
ingenious and cultivated lady, she could not have chosen
any better calculated to awaken admiration and attention.
The peculiar pale, clear light of a sky from which the sun
had been gone for half an hour, made the creek a band of
silver through the dark green fields it crossed, and brought
out everything, from the far-off mountains in the west to
the dark outline of Nattee's graceful figure, in the most

<!-- page 47 -->

delicate, but clearest relief. Her striped woollen skirt and
dark blue short-gown lost their color against the pale sky,
and so, almost, did her bronzed, rounded limbs, naked half-way 
to the knee, and her straight glossy hair knotted low
in the neck, and of her face, Larry only saw the well-cut
outline for which she must thank her Indian father, and the
startled look of animal fear which dilated into positive
beauty her great dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, Nattee, you little fool," he said, leading the horse
up to the fence; "why are you so afraid of this great
brute? He'll never hurt you. Get on and ride him up to
the barn."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she cried, shrinking back; "oh, Master Larry,
I can't, indeed I can't."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said, slipping the bridle over his arm,
and coming up to the fence. "You must get used to him;
you'll not mind after you are on. Don't be silly, girl, I'll
lead him."</p>

<p>A cold chill ran through her, but habitual obedience
made her unresisting as the young man, putting his strong
arm around her, swung her up upon the horse's back. For
two minutes she clung shaking to the mane, and felt, with
horror, nothing but the heavy tramp of the heavy-limbed
beast beneath her, and the hot flesh of his muscular neck
against her arms; but soon the regularity of his movements 
and the reassurance of Larry's presence and protection 
relieved her from her fears, and reconciled her to her
strange position.</p>

<p>The only spot where the creek was fordable was some
distance above them, but the young man did not appear in

<!-- page 48 -->

any haste to reach it and whistled as he walked along, and
talked to Dirck, and sometimes threw a word at Nattee,
and did not seem to think at all of his father's anger at the
delay; but only to be indifferently and indolently content.
When they reached the ford, Nattee would have got down,
and said, "Oh, Master Larry, don't go through the water
with your boots;" but he did not take any notice, and kept
on, plashing down into the creek without even looking at
her. How cool the water sounded, as the man's feet and
the horse's feet dashed it up about their limbs; and as they
came up on the other bank, and brushed through the tall
beds of white clover that lined the water's edge, there
came such a delicious scent of the crushed flowers, that
Lawrence stooped and picked a handful of them as he
walked along.</p>

<p>The forgotten terror, however, came back to Nattee as
they reached the lane. How long they had loitered, how
dark it was growing! What if master were waiting now
for Dirck! But as she glanced aside at Larry's handsome,
careless face, she was sure she need not fear; he would not
let her be punished for what was not the fault of her
cowardice alone.</p>

<p>"What can father want with Dirck this evening?" he
said at last, echoing her thought, but speaking, more to
himself than to her.</p>

<p>"I think," faltered Nattee, timidly, for she was always
timid, when she spoke to him, "I think he's going down to
the Stadt to see if he can hear anything of the folks that's
coming from&mdash;from over sea, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." And Larry fell into a state of musing, and

<!-- page 49 -->

poor Nattee began to wish she hadn't set him thinking
about those tiresome cousins, that he might have gone on
whistling and jerking Dirck's bridle when he put his head
down into the clover, and looking carelessly around at her
when the sudden motion of the horse threatened to unseat
her. Never before in all her life, though she was born
upon his father's place, and had grown up from a child
in his father's kitchen, had Lawrence ever looked at her
with any glance that was not the most casual and indifferent, 
and never repeated till she came unavoidably under
his eye again. And ever since he had come home from
school, a handsome lad of seventeen, she had longed, in
the secret depths of her heart, for some such glance as he
had given her to-night, some notice, however slight, that
might be a fitter recompense for her services than the
shining lavish coin he tossed about among the slaves at
Christmas. Larry was generous and kind, though determined 
and high-handed, and the family servants loved him
with the same sincerity and fervor with which they hated
his father. But to Nattee, brought up by her tender-hearted 
mistress more like a child of the family than a
servant, he was a hero, a young king: and sitting in
loving docility at his mother's feet, she eagerly imbibed,
along with much of her gentleness and refinement, the
whole of her indiscriminating love and blind adoration for
her boy. Kind Mrs. Sutherland, yearning always for
something to lavish her affection on, had not the foresight
to recognize the danger of this ill-judged kindness to her
favorite slave. In one way or another, sooner or later, the
smallest departure from the quiet, even path of justice and

<!-- page 50 -->

propriety, will make itself felt, and though the departure
may be on virtue's side, it is a departure, nevertheless, and
will put things out, and grate, and jar, and breed discomfort 
and confusion, long after the error itself has been
forgotten.</p>

<p>Larry stopped suddenly, as a winding of the lane
brought them in sight of the gate. Before it was a large
covered country wagon, and by the head of the stout
horses stood a plethoric Dutchman, whom Larry recognized 
as the landlord of the inn at the Stadt.</p>

<p>"What brings him here?" he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Nattee, slipping down from the horse,
"they must have come&mdash;I know it's them, the English
cousins from over sea. And look, there through the
lilacs, they're going into the house."</p>

<p>Larry looked, and a slight flush on his brown face, and a
slight compression of his well-cut lips resulted from the
look.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, rather shortly pulling up Dirck from
the clover, and nodding a good evening to Mynheer Vanderhouser, 
as he passed him on his way to the barn. He
told Nattee abruptly she might go into the house and help
Salome, he'd put the saddle on Dirck, and leave him at the
farmyard gate. Nattee was going away with a disappointed 
look, when he called out to her, "If my mother
says anything about it, you may tell her I am gone down
to Martin's. I shan't be back till late."</p>

With all his manliness and native lordliness, there was a
touch of the rustic in young Sutherland; he dreaded with
a cowardly dread the first interview with these foreign-bred

<!-- page 51 -->

relations; he felt their intrusion upon the ease of his home
as an intolerable constraint, and from the first notice
of their coming, all his generous-minded hospitality and
habitual good humor had quite forsaken him. The idea of
the homely farmhouse and homely family ways passing
under the eye of this dainty young lady, used to such very
different ways, and his own manners and acquirements
criticised by this young scholar, of whose Oxford career he
had heard so much, had made him as thoroughly uncomfortable 
and ill-tempered as it was at all possible for him to
be, every time he had thought of it for the past two
months, and now things had culminated, and he was
savage as he turned his back upon the house, and saddling
Bess, dashed off toward the asylum that older and wiser
men had sought before him&mdash;the tavern. Women, not
having any tavern or club to rush to from the presence of
domestic infelicity, have to learn a little self-control, which,
perhaps, stands them in as good stead, after all, though the
idea of flight is seductive at a first glance.</p>

<p>As Larry disappeared within the barn, Nattee turned
toward the house feeling quite wretched and unsatisfied,
but the indication of some unusual stir in the kitchen, and
the recollection of the long-expected arrival somewhat
revived her spirits. Salome met her with a volley of
reproaches on account of her long absence, and sent her
off to look up Amen, who had been sent off to look up
eggs, which were to be cooked for the strangers' supper,
and which were still probably lying warm and undisturbed
in the nests under the mow, Amen being the untrustiest of
messengers. In fact, after a long search, Nattee found

<!-- page 52 -->

him, quite unconscious of eggs and time, playing mumble-peg 
on the barn-floor with the knife which had fallen from
his master's pocket as he mounted Bess. He dodged
Nattee's provoked slap, and slipped off to the creek for a
swim, leaving her to hunt the eggs and swallow her indignation 
as best she might.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Nattee re&euml;ntered the kitchen, some ten minutes
after, with her hardly-earned basket of eggs, Salome did
not give her time to anathematize Amen, but pointing to a
pile of extremely white towels lying on the dresser, told
her to hurry up with them to the spare bedroom, where
the young lady was to sleep, and to look if there was fresh
water in the pitcher. Nattee caught up a candle, for it
was genuinely dark by that time, and ran up the back
stairs and across the open garret to the side door that led
into the spare bedroom. The ceremony of knocking was
not much attended to in that place and generation;
besides, Nattee had not the least idea that the young lady
had gone up to take possession of her room, so she hastily
opened the door and entered, not perceiving, till she was
half across the floor, that there were candles lighted on the
mantelpiece, and that beside the bed some one was kneeling, 
with hidden face, in an abandoned attitude of
wretchedness. Nattee dropped the armful of towels, and

<!-- page 54 -->

retreated hastily to the door, but her ready woman's
sympathy drew her half way back again. What should
she do for her, this poor young thing, so homesick and so
far from home. She could not leave her, crying that way,
as if her heart was broken. Perhaps she'd better go down
and tell her mistress; but no, the door by which she had
been brought to her room was bolted tight, and she had
thought herself alone no doubt, and had not meant any one
should know how dreadfully unhappy she was. After
a few moments, Nattee, unable any longer to restrain her
pity, ejaculated:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear young lady, don't&mdash;don't cry so&mdash;it'll
make you sick&mdash;I can't bear to see you cry so."</p>

<p>The young lady started violently to her feet, and her
first look, as she grasped the post of the bedstead and
supported herself by it, was one that told, even to Nattee,
the cruelty of the intrusion. All through the terrible voyage 
that was just over, though half dead with sea-sickness
and home-sickness, she had never once given way to the
misery poor Warren tried not to suspect, and ever since
they landed she had struggled bravely to keep up and give
him constant smiles and reassurances; but this was the
end&mdash;she had promised herself only to bear the terrible
suppression of emotion till she reached her journey's end;
she had longed more hungrily for one moment by herself
than for any other consolation&mdash;one room into which she
could shut herself, and sob out the devouring misery she
had so long smothered in her heart.</p>

<p>And here she was; here was the home to which this
dreary journey had tended; in this low, dark house, with

<!-- page 55 -->

its stern, unfamiliar, un-English look, the grey, dusky twilight 
growing greyer and duskier as it settled round it&mdash;here 
she must live, and forget England&mdash;here she must be
happy. Coarse and uncongenial companions, no doubt, all
she would have, must be. The repulsive face of her uncle,
the thick, dull faces of all the Dutch travellers they had
encountered on the road, almost obliterated the impression
of the gentle, brown-eyed matron who had met her with so
motherly though so timid an embrace. The truth was,
poor Laura was so overdone and wretched that everything
looked black and hopeless, she could not be reasonable or
wise; and when this strange, rude creature burst in upon
her sacred privacy, she could only think, with miserable
resignation, that there was nothing else to be hoped for
here.</p>

<p>Nattee, too, was quite as much frightened, and quite as
uncomfortable as her victim, and was stammering some
incoherent excuse, and retreating, when something in
Laura's face overcame her afresh with pity, and made her
forget her chagrin and awkwardness.</p>

<p>"Oh," she faltered, clasping her hands together as she
approached her, "oh, if you only wouldn't mind me, if
you'd only let me stay by you and take care of you. You
can cry just the same&mdash;I won't tell mistress. I'll lay you
on the bed and bolt the door, and keep everything so quiet.
I'm so dreadful sorry for you."</p>

<p>And the slow tears that gathered in her eyes looked very
much as if this na&iuml;ve sympathy came from an honest heart.
Whatever sort of a heart it came from, however, it went
with a startling power to Laura's, and throwing one arm

<!-- page 56 -->

round the girl's brown neck, she flung herself upon the bed
and gave way to an uncontrolled burst of weeping. Nattee
stooped tenderly over her, holding with a loving reverence
the "white wonder" of her hand, caressing it almost fearfully 
as it lay in her own, then smoothing back the wavy,
dishevelled hair on the pillow, and laying in straight folds
the heavy, clinging, black dress on the white counterpane.
The words she whispered were probably of not much avail,
of themselves, in dissipating the sorrows of the unhappy
stranger; but there was something soothing in her tone
and touch, and by and by the sobs subsided to a low, convulsive 
catching of the breath at intervals, and the suffering
face regained a quiet look, while Nattee stole away and
busied herself with adjusting the disordered room, and
folding up the cloaks and wrappers that were flung down
near the door. There is always a sense of comfort in being
taken care of, that penetrates insensibly the heaviest dejection; 
the sound of a guarded step about the room, the
smothered opening and shutting of a door, the low whispered 
question, all tuned to suit the aching ear of suffering,
have a charm that may not be recognized, but can hardly
fail of being felt. Love never goes unfelt, or is bestowed
in vain, except when the cup of life is full already to the
brim with happiness; empty, aching hearts find ready
room for even the humblest affection offered. If Laura had
been at home, and happy, as she was six months ago, and
this poor Nattee had shown her this devoted homage, she
would have looked down at her with half amused interest
and gentle kindness, but without anything of the gratitude
and tenderness she experienced now.</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>Presently there came a tap at the door, and a man's voice
outside said, "Laura." Laura started up, and putting her
hand to her forehead, exclaimed in a low tone, "Warren
must not see me so. What <i>shall</i> I do?"</p>

<p>While Nattee, laying her finger on her lip, stole across
to the door and opened it a-crack. "The lady's lying
down," she said in a whisper. "Perhaps she'll go to sleep,
she's so tired. Did you want anything, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," the young man answered, in a tone of some relief.
"I'm glad she's lying down. Ask her if I shall come in a
moment."</p>

<p>"Would it be good to disturb her, sir?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he replied, a little hesitatingly. "You'll
be by her, I suppose, if she rouses, and will call me if she
desires to see me."</p>

<p>Nattee dipped a graceful courtesy to him as he turned
away.</p>

<p>"I'm glad poor Laura has such a nice creature about
her," thought the careworn and troubled Warren as he
went downstairs. "What a beautiful young gentleman!"
thought Nattee, as she softly closed the door. "But <i>oh</i>
what a difference between him and Master Larry!" And
the beautiful young gentleman's end of the beam kicked
the air, of course.</p>

<p>It was very late on the following morning when Laura
started up from her heavy sleep. The chintz hangings of
the high-posted bed were between her and the sunshine
from the window, and for a few moments she gazed bewildered 
at the gay, grotesque birds on them, uncomfortably
uncertain whether she were in the tropics or at home with

<!-- page 58 -->

a bad headache, of which these gaudy things were the
result, but Nattee's eager face appeared presently at the
opening, and she sank down with an "oh!" that told it had
all come back to her. She could not have cried then,
though everything looked even blanker than it did the
night before; but she was too unelastic and flat for the
mental effort it would have required. Even the fancy for
Nattee had faded, though she got up languidly and dressed
herself with her help.</p>

<p>"It's ever so late!" Nattee volunteered.</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Laura, remembering indifferently she had
not wound up her watch the night before, a recollection
which always gives one a sense of discomfort and out-of-jointness.</p>

<p>"It's most nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Your brother's just had his breakfast; he slept late
too. And he's gone out walking over the place with master. 
And Salome's got your breakfast all kept hot for
you. You like your cream cakes nice an' brown, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care particularly; I'm sorry to have put
any one to trouble, for I am not hungry. I don't think I
can eat any breakfast."</p>

<p>It was quite a blow to Nattee to find the young lady so
dead to the pleasures of the palate; she gave up the
breakfast question, but, resolved upon interesting her at
all hazards, she began upon family topics.</p>

<p>"Mistress has been frettin' about you so, all the morning, 
for fear you was sick, and didn't sleep good, and

<!-- page 59 -->

wouldn't be happy here, and would be hankering after your
own home, and all that."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a bother that's going to be," thought Laura,
languidly. "To be teased all the time about my looks
and my appetite and my home-sickness. If they only let
me alone"&mdash;&mdash;

"Ain't it a pity," Nattee said, "you can't see Master
Larry, till to-night? He's gone over the mountain with a
couple of men, to see about drawing some logs for the new
barn, and he won't be back till supper. You've never seen
Master Larry?"</p>

<p>"Larry?" repeated the young lady, absently. "Oh, my
cousin&mdash;no, I've never seen him."</p>

<p>"And the young gentleman&mdash;that's your brother, I mean&mdash;didn't 
see him neither. He went before he was up.
What a pity he's going to be gone all day!"</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven," murmured Laura, under her breath;
for in her secret heart, though she was too gentle and too
kind to encourage the thought, much less to give it expression, 
the one she most dreaded of her new associates, was
this young farmer. Her uncle and aunt were English born,
and though, perhaps, roughened by and inured to this different 
life, must still, she was sure, retain some of the softening 
influences of the old; but the younger one, born and
brought up among the hardy settlers of this new land,
must, she felt intuitively, be on a level with them in roughness 
and want of refinement, while his near relation to her,
and the similarity of their ages, would naturally bring them
more together, and make him more familiar with her. She
shrank so uncomfortably from the thought of this, that

<!-- page 60 -->

Nattee instinctively felt she had touched a disagreeable subject, 
and that for some reason Master Larry's praises did
not find any echo in her listener's mind.</p>

<p>"See what a nice day it is!" she said, at last, drawing
back the curtains and pushing up the window.</p>

<p>"Very nice," Laura answered, hardly glancing out, and
after a moment added, "May I trouble you to drop the
curtain again: the light hurts my eyes so."</p>

<p>Poor Nattee! There are some people who are constitutionally 
incapable of doing anything right, and in despair
she went downstairs to prepare for the young lady's
arrival at the breakfast table. It was a very long half
hour before Laura descended the stairs herself, and even
then, she did not immediately direct her steps toward the
sitting-room. She walked slowly and thoughtfully through
the low stone hall, glancing with some curiosity at the
dark, heavy beams overhead, and the rows of stiff, high-backed 
chairs on each side, and the rather rough "Map of
Ulster County" on the wall, and the huge brass spyglass
hanging beneath it, not much comforted or encouraged by
the contrast it presented to the cheerful pleasant hall of Borringdon 
Parsonage, pictured, and carpeted, and sunny. But
at the open hall door she paused, and, leaning against the
post, took in her first draught of the delicious summer morning. 
Not even Borringdon itself could have shown a fairer
phase of it than lay before her. The low stone porch had
an untrained wilderness of sweetbrier and trumpet-creeper
wandering over it, through the festoons and crevices of
which, at the side, were glimpses of deep blue sky and
deeper blue mountains, while in front, beyond the shrubbery 

<!-- page 61 -->

and the grass-plat, lay the wide-stretching Flats, here
white with buckwheat, there yellow with com, or stacked
with the newly-cut and fragrant hay; while, in and out, the
creek wound its devious course, sometimes unseen, but
always marked by the thick trees that skirted it. It <i>was</i>
lovely: she was in God's land even here, and a faint
reviving sense of pleasure stirred her worn-out, home-sick,
hopeless heart. She put up her hand and pulled down a
branch of the sweetbrier that hung above her, to bring
nearer the evanescent floating sweetness that filled the air,
and her movement startled from an adjacent cluster of the
trumpet creeper, that wonder and darling of the New
World, a tiny humming-bird, who, hanging suspended in
palpitating indecision, for an instant, over the rich heart of
the dark-red flower, darted terrified away, piercing the air
with his swift flight.</p>

<p>While she was standing with the branch of sweetbrier in
her hand, following with delighted eyes the flight of the
wonderful bird, her uncle and Warren suddenly came in
sight. A dutiful resignation made her drop the sweetbrier
and step down into the path to meet them. Ralph favored
her with his hand and a piercing long stare from under his
grizzled shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You're monstrous pale this morning, lass," he said
letting go her hand and passing on into the house, while
the pale lass shrank timidly to the side of her brother, who
laid his hand upon her arm and looked anxiously and
silently into her face, as she followed the old man.</p>

<p>Laura did not hear his low sigh, nor did she see the look
of pain upon his face, as he turned away and went back

<!-- page 62 -->

into the porch, for she had caught sight of her aunt
through the sitting-room door and was moving forward to
meet her. Mrs. Sutherland embraced her hurriedly and
nervously, for Ralph, laying down his pipe, was eyeing
them attentively.</p>

<p>This was not lost upon the quick-sighted and quick-sympathied 
English girl; and though it deepened her aversion
to her uncle, it diverted her morbid homesick fancies a
little from their recent objects of devotion, and inspired her
with a very healthy and profitable affection and pity for her
gentle and uncomplaining aunt. She still felt blank and
lonely, but the first grappling-iron of sympathy had been
thrown out that would soon draw her toward and attach
her to this new and untried life. She had crossed the great
ocean of separation and self-sacrifice, and whatever the haven
proved to which her duty had led her, no doubt the spirit
of submission that has been her guide throughout would
reconcile her to it, and in time, perhaps, bring its own
reward of contentment and satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warren Sutherland's</span> task, in reconciling himself to

Apart from the fact that women always accommodate themselves 
to changed circumstances more aptly than men, there
was that in his trial that Laura knew nothing of, save
through her sympathy for him. He had left all hope and
pleasure behind him in England; that is, all the hope and
pleasure that this world can offer or bestow; he had put it
out of his power to be tempted again by these things, and
he had hoped to have forgotten that they existed. He had
hoped that the great sacrifice by which he had cut himself
off from worldly advancement and earthly interests, would
have resulted in a self-conquest and peace that would have
repaid him for the effort&mdash;that the entire consecration of
his life, talents, and affections to the service of God would
have brought with it an immediate release from the temptations 
he renounced. He was beginning to see that one
great act of renunciation will not win Heaven nor Heaven's

would lie within our reach; how sure a cure a monastery or
a desert would become; how infinitely easier than to struggle 
on in the state of life in which it hath pleased God to
place us, continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt
affections, daily conquering what is daily tempting, daily
renouncing what is daily loved, and daily proceeding in all
virtue and godliness of living.</p>

<p>Not that Warren's motive had been a cowardly one, a
desperate resolution to fly his temptation and be done with
it forever: but he had unconsciously hoped that, having
done his duty at so terrible a cost, he might reap some present 
peace from its performance. Everything had pointed
to his acceptance of this mission. No desirable home had
presented in England for Laura, a home and relatives were
to be had in America. Sir Charles had not offered the
living, though half-promises and rumors of his intention to
do it had reached him; a necessity for some decision was
pressing, when, unexpectedly, the appointment to this post
had arrived. Convinced of the importance of this much
neglected field of Christian labor, conscious of his own
power to perform the duties of it well, cut off from all binding 
ties at home&mdash;what lay in the way of his accepting the
post, and fulfilling to the letter his ordination vows of self-renunciation 
and devotion? Nothing but a love that was
at once hopeless and unprofitable; and with a manly resolution 
he put it aside forever.</p>

<p>He had hardly answered the bishop's letter accepting
the appointment, when one arrived from Sir Charles,
acquainting him, in sufficiently courteous terms, with his

<!-- page 65 -->

desire that he should retain the living which his father
had so long and so honorably held. It was not too late,
he could write and recall his decision, and for one moment,
Warren wavered, and that moment was the most critical
of his life. But his mind was too clear and well-balanced,
his heart too pure, his conscience too well instructed to
suffer him to waver long. If the mission to America had
been his duty, before he had any inducement to stay at
home, it continued to be his duty after he had had such
inducement, the sacrifice had been made in his own mind,
the resolution taken; what right had he to trifle with his
own conscience, and say, Laura's comfort, or his own
health, or respect to his father's memory, required him to
stay and fill his place?</p>

<p>All such considerations he recognized as the suggestions
of his ghostly enemies, and with resolute heroism, he
refused to listen to them. His own health he had no
right to favor at the cost of the smallest duty; his father's
honor would be best served by his son's faithfulness in
whatever field God appointed for him; Laura had already
resigned herself to the change, and had begun her preparations 
for it, and though her pleasure and her temporal
advantage might be better consulted by remaining at
Borringdon, his sober judgment told him, in one respect
at least, she would be safer under the care of her aunt in
America, for she was still very young to have the care of
even so modest an establishment as the Parsonage, and such
a position would devolve upon her many duties for which
she was totally unfitted. Besides, reasoned Warren, why
should I be indulgent and worldly-minded for her any more

<!-- page 66 -->

than for myself? I must help, instead of hinder her in
giving up the world. I have no right to guide myself by
the wisdom it dictates, the rule that I own is foolishness in
its esteem. I must be contented with the approval of my
own conscience and with the hope of God's approval.</p>

<p>And so they came to America: here they were at the
end of that long, weary journey&mdash;here was the home to
which he had brought poor Laura, and here, in a few
weeks, he must leave her. Doubts and misgivings beset
him cruelly that first day, as he saw more and more of
his uncle's unaccountably perverse and tyrannical disposition, 
and his aunt's want of firmness and self-reliance.
What guardians were these for a young girl brought up
as Laura had been? What companions they and their son
would prove for these most important years of her life!
What an atmosphere in which to develop her character!
Ah, what had he done? what if he had been selfish in his
self-sacrifice? Were his motives pure?&mdash;or was this all
a mistaken duty? What good could he do among the
poor Indians and slaves he had sacrificed so much to
teach? He felt more ignorant and impotent than they,
and the zeal and earnestness that had sustained him till
now, failed him in this hour of need. Everything seemed
giving way and changing&mdash;in himself&mdash;in his surroundings&mdash;in 
his judgment of things.</p>

<p>And coming suddenly, that afternoon, upon Laura,
sitting idly on the stone step of the porch, her work on
her lap, and her eyes fixed absently on the distant
mountains, full of tears and unspeakably sad, he turned
away from her with an exclamation of despair so unlike his

<!-- page 67 -->

usual quiet self-control, that she started up, and, throwing
her arms around him, burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Warren! Forgive me, I am not so unhappy. Oh,
how wretched I have made you! Don't look so, dear
Warren. Oh, what have I done?"</p>

<p>"My poor sister! What have <i>I</i> done? Ah, Laura,
Laura, how shall I make up for this cruelty to you?"</p>

<p>It would have been happier for them if this had never
passed between them; for weeks they had kept up the
mask of cheerfulness, and at times had half deceived each
other; but from this moment they could not conceal it
that their smiles were never anything but a loving deceit,
that there was but one homesick heart-beat between them;
and all pretext for cheerfulness was gone.</p>

<p>Warren drew Laura's arm within his, and led her down
to the grape-vine arbor, under the thick cover of which
they walked and talked, with mingled tears and confessions
on Laura's part, and sadness and tenderness on Warren's,
till Nattee summoned them to the house to supper. Larry
did not return, and his mother, who in all his rambling
adventurous career had never become used to bearing without 
anxiety half an hour's tardiness in the time of his
return, made herself very miserable about him, and together
with Nattee, put away refreshments enough for his supper
to have sufficed a whole platoon, and gave Ralph some
excuse for his ill-tempered sneers. These, however, he
abruptly ended by quitting the room, and inviting Warren
to go with him. Like all self-willed, hard-headed opinionated 
men, he loved a quiet listener, and this he found in
Warren, and it formed the basis of his decent treatment

<!-- page 68 -->

of him. His peculiar propensity to threaten and oppress
his family and the members of his household had given
them the impression that there was something in the tie
of blood that acted on him in an inverted and monstrous
way, and that whatever or whoever came under his roof
as guest, as dependent, or possession, would incur his diabolical 
malevolence. But there seemed to be something in
the young clergyman's self-respect, self-possession, and
good sense, that insensibly called up all the gentleman
in him, if anything of the gentleman could be considered
to be left in him after thirty years of conscious endeavor
to root all traces of such a disposition out.</p>

<p>Laura thought&mdash;"Oh, poor Warren, to have to talk to
that dreadful man so long!" and finding her aunt and
Nattee busy about the arrangements for Larry's comfort,
she slipped out into the yard and wandered about in a
sort of negative content, absent and dreamy, only happy
at being let alone, and having a half hour to herself. At
the right of the house there lay an orchard, which looked,
as the declining sun sent its long, slanting shadows across
the level sward under the thick, low-hanging boughs, more
tempting and secluded than any other spot; so climbing,
with infinite pains, over the high-barred gate, which her
strength was insufficient to open, she picked up her pretty,
modish Leghorn hat, which had fallen on the other side,
and walked on into the very heart of the orchard.</p>

<p>This was the oldest orchard on the place, and, looked at
agriculturally, was fast becoming a tolerably worthless
one, but looked at picturesquely was a particularly
valuable possession. In its day, whenever that had been,

<!-- page 69 -->

it bore evidence of having been a very fine one: the
ground inclosed was very large and perfectly level, and
a well built stone wall separated it on three sides from the
adjacent fields, and from the farmyard, while a thick
hedge of lilacs, within a similar wall, shut it off from the
lane that led from the highway to the house. The great
age and growth of the trees added as much to their beauty
as they detracted from their marketable value. They
were placed at considerable distances from each other, and
the grass beneath was short and velvety, almost as trim
and clean as an English lawn, shaved every morning, upon
which each fallen apple rested like a ball of gold or of
vermilion. Laura wandered slowly through the ranks of
grotesque old trunks, admiring, with her quick, appreciative 
sense of all that was admirable in nature, the grey
gnarled branches, from which it seemed an actual miracle
that such green leaves and such rosy fruit should spring,
and the bent, hollow trunks, that seemed, for all their age,
to keep so firm a hold of earth, and to drink in such
pleasure from it.</p>

<p>How soft and still the evening was, and how quiet all
around. The barn-yard clatter seemed for a space to be
lulled; the men were at their supper, the cows stood ready
for the milking below the barn, and their occasional lowing,
and the twitter from a bird's nest in the hollow of a tree
above her head, and the plash of the creek below the sheep
lot, where it fell over a ledge of rocks, were the lonely
country sounds that soothed her ear.</p>

<p>"How delightful it is," she thought, stooping to pick up
a yellow harvest apple at her feet. "I shall come here

<!-- page 70 -->

always when I want to be alone, and after Warren goes,
that will be nearly all the time."</p>

<p>The apples looked so clear and golden, that as she went
slowly forward she picked them up, until she had an armful, 
and without the slightest appreciation of anything but
their beauty, and not having the least use or desire for
them except because they looked so pretty, she was lifting
her hand to shake the fruit from a low bough that drooped
within her reach, when the sound of an approaching footstep 
in the lot beyond, and the sudden vaulting of some
one over the stone wall, made her start and relinquish the
branch. It was a tall, well-built young man, in rough
working clothes, with a short axe in the belt at his side, and
a gun over his shoulder. He stopped for a moment to
whistle up his companion, a setter dog, who followed him
presently over the wall, and ran on beside him with panting
sides and lolling tongue, that proclaimed her more weary
than her master. He had not the least appearance of
fatigue or discomfort, as he strode on through the orchard
with his favorite at his heels, whistling carelessly and looking 
nowhere.</p>

<p>Laura knew intuitively that it was her cousin. "What
shall I do&mdash;where shall I go," she thought in an agony of
alarm, dropping her armful of apples on the ground, and
turning to fly. But there was no escape, with the high
wall all around, and that horrible five-barred gate. He
would overtake her before she could get over. There was
no use, she must face it bravely and speak to him, as well
now as any other time. Once must be the first, and there
was no advantage in putting off the evil day.</p>

<!-- page 71 -->

<p>The heavy fall of the apples on the ground had brought
the intruder to a sudden stand-still, and glancing around
with a surprised look, he saw a very unwelcome but a very
pretty sight. For one moment he, too, thought of flight,
and turning uneasily on his heel, took a step in an opposite
direction, biting his lip, and looking disturbed and awkward
enough. But his manliness and common sense returned
presently to his help. There was no use in this absurdity.
He wasted several wordless curses on his awkwardness and
folly, and lowering his gun from his shoulder, faced about,
and walked resolutely toward the young lady, who, having
come to a similar decision, had advanced a step to meet
him. Larry's face was rather flushed, and his usual easy
confidence had suffered a great shock, for he took off his
straw hat, and walked up to her with anything but easy
confidence. In fact, he approached as nearly to awkwardness 
and clodhopperism on that occasion as it is possible
for a well-made, athletic, handsome man to do. Laura
looked a shade paler than usual, her alarm having resulted
in giving her additional coldness and dignity of manner.</p>

<p>To make matters worse. Kelpie, sniffing about with much
sagacious inquiry, rushed along a foot and a half in
advance of her master, and, as she reached Laura, broke
into a short, unamiable bark. Laura shrank back, and
Larry, stepping forward, bestowed a heavy kick on the
dog, and sent her yelping away. The satin feeling of the
slim hand laid for an instant in his rough palm, anything
but reassured him.</p>

<p>"My cousin Lawrence, I suppose?" And the young

<!-- page 72 -->

lady courtesied, very coy, and quiet, and cold. And the
young man very briefly, and rather clumsily, acknowledged
his identity with the Cousin Lawrence of her imagination,
and added some commonplace and insincere expression of
satisfaction at her arrival. "Thank you," she said dutifully, 
and thereupon ensued a very uncomfortable pause,
broken presently by Laura, who hazarded the observation
that this was a very pleasant orchard.</p>

<p>"You have dropped your apples," then said her new
acquaintance, bending down to pick them up.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't gather them again, please," cried Laura, with
sudden alacrity of manner, afraid of nothing so much as
prolonging the interview. "I don't want them at all. I
only picked them up because they looked pretty. I'd
rather not have them, if you please."</p>

<p>He bowed, and threw down the handful he had gathered,
while she added, with more candor than courtesy:</p>

<p>"I am only walking here by myself till the sun sets; I
shall go in before twilight. Do not let me keep you from
your supper."</p>

<p>Another bow, and he strode across the orchard to the
fence, and flung himself over it with an ease that quite
raised him in his cousin's eyes.</p>

<p>"He's better looking than I thought," she pondered,
"but vastly clownish and underbred, and how cruel to that
poor dog. Ah, how I wish he might go away and leave
as here in peace!"</p>

<p>If a similar wish in regard to herself passed through the
mind of the young man as he left the orchard, it cannot be
very much wondered at, nor can he be very much blamed

<!-- page 73 -->

for it. When he reached the house, he was in an exceedingly 
irritable frame of mind, and he bore with less fortitude 
than usual his mother's lamentations over his late
return and unnecessary provisions for his comfort, and
being too dutiful to vent it openly on her, poor Nattee had
to bear the weight of it, and choking down her tears,
obeyed his order to leave the room and go about her work
if she had any. He hated to have the whole house turned
topsy turvy if he stayed out an hour beyond supper-time;
he hated to have all the women in the family waiting on him
as if he were a paralytic. Tell Salome he had as many
muffins as he wanted, and let Nattee go about her work,
"and, mother, you sit down, will you."</p>

<p>So Nattee was sent off wretched, and the fountains of
Salome's sympathy were staunched, and Mrs. Sutherland
was overwhelmed with contrition and dejection; and all
because of this new cousin! Quite unconscious of the
cause of the offence, however, Mrs. Sutherland humbly
began to cast about for some subject to amuse him with,
and very unfortunately hit upon the very one that had
caused the trouble. He bore it as long as he could with
patience, then rising from the table, he pushed back his
chair with no very gentle emphasis, and exclaimed with
indifferently concealed irritation:</p>

<p>"My dear mother, I hope you will excuse me, but I am
very little interested in this arrival. Let us talk of anything 
else, just now; it wearies me."</p>

<p>This silenced the poor mother effectually; she watched
him with deep concern as he walked heavily two or three
times up and down the room, turning presently to leave it,

<!-- page 74 -->

when, by another door, enter Ralph and the young clergyman.</p>

<p>"Lawrence," said the old man shortly, "here's your
cousin."</p>

<p>"Well, I see him," Lawrence felt inclined to say, and to
walk straight out of the room; but he did not; he only set
his teeth together for an instant in an angry way, then
turned quickly toward them, walked up to his cousin and
held out his hand in anything but a clownish manner, in
fact, in rather a soldierly and determined manner.</p>

<p>"I hope you will excuse my absence to-day, sir," he said
in a tone that did not attempt to be a soft one. "I have
been obliged to be away."</p>

<p>"I have regretted your absence very much," Warren
returned, giving him his hand cordially. "We have so
much lost time to make up for as cousins, that I feel we
cannot begin too soon."</p>

<p>Lawrence bowed rather stiffly and they both sat down,
one on each side of the shining mahogany table. Lawrence
looked a little more flushed and handsome than usual, and
spoke less like an honest-hearted and manly fellow than he
ever did before in his life; while Warren, in his black
clothes, and with his pale and aristocratic face, looked
much more like a grand gentleman than he had any right
or any desire to look. Therefore, it were needless to say,
the two were not favorably impressed with each other, notwithstanding 
Warren's earnest efforts to that end. The
stiffness threatened never to wear off. Mrs. Sutherland left
the room, busy about some household duty; Ralph took
off his boots; and settled himself in a certain old-mannish

<!-- page 75 -->

easy chair that was consecrate to him especially, and
neither addressed nor answered any one, but kept a grim
surveillance over all within the room. Nattee removed
Lawrence's supper from the table, and put the dark-red
homespun cloth upon it, and presently brought in a couple of
lighted candles, for it was growing dark. The two young
men were left necessarily to each other's mercy, but only
talked in a desultory stranger-like manner, of things that
strangers generally talk about, and naturally grew less
familiar every moment.</p>

<p>At the expiration of an hour, Mrs. Sutherland returned
with her knitting in her hand, and sat down near her son.
She looked around with some surprise, and said, "Why,
where is Laura?"</p>

<p>"She's probably in her room," said Warren, getting up
"I'll go and ask her to come down."</p>

<p>But in a moment he returned, looking a little anxious,
and said she was not there. At the same instant Nattee
came in and whispered to her mistress, she could not find
Miss Laura anywhere. Mrs. Sutherland, always prone to
alarm on all occasions, started up quite pale and trembling,
and followed Warren into the hall, Nattee bringing up the
rear with a lantern which she had set down near the door.
"The creek," Lawrence heard his mother say faintly, as
they left the hall. Next to the fear of Indian depredations,
the nearness of the creek was the most undying source of
misery the poor lady knew. A dozen times a day her heart
sank at imaginary cries of distress coming from that quarter; 
she never began a day without a dreadful conviction
that before its close either Lawrence or Nattee, or one of

<!-- page 76 -->

the men or boys, would be fished up from its treacherous
depths, stark and stiff; nobody or nothing was ever missing, 
from colts and calves to men and boys, but her imagination 
flew to that unconscious and smiling stream. That
Lawrence had grown up to manhood beside it, was nothing
short of a miracle; his boyhood had been one long term of
misery to her on its account; and now, from the moment
Warren said Laura was not in her room, the conviction
flashed upon her she had fallen in the creek&mdash;they would
be too late to save her&mdash;it was just what she had been
always dreading.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" muttered Lawrence, getting up and shaking 
himself, as the door slammed after their hurried exodus. 
"I could have told 'em where to find her if they'd
stopped to hear me. The girl's safe enough; it's only some
of her fine airs; she's so monstrous fond of walking by herself, 
I think I'll let her enjoy it a little longer."</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few moments, however, his better
feelings conquered, and going into an adjoining closet, he
reached down a lantern, lit it, took up his hat and went
out. The night was cloudy, and a thick close fog had come
up since sunset, so the lantern was quite a necessary accompaniment 
to the search. Indeed, he could not have seen
two feet ahead without it, and he went directly toward the
orchard, quickening his pace as he went on, and thinking
somewhat more charitably of the young lady since he himself 
had come out into the darkness. Surely she did not
stay out voluntarily such an evening as this.</p>

After he was over in the orchard, however, he began to
feel a little awkwardly about his errand; he did not see anything 

<!-- page 77 -->

of her, and though he wanted to call her name, he
did not know exactly what name to call. He couldn't
begin right away to Laura her, and he'd see her hanged
before he'd call her Miss Sutherland. So he went along
swinging his lantern and whistling carelessly, hoping she
would hear him, and give some intimation of her presence
if he approached her. But the carelessness of the whistle
rather declined as he went on and saw no sign of her in any
direction. Where, to be sure, had she gone? What, if
for once, his mother's foolish fears had some foundation?
She might have strayed down toward the creek after he
left her, and been tempted to get in the boat. The boat
was a crazy little thing at best, and ought to have been
split up for firewood half a year ago. He would give another 
reconnoitre round the field, and then go and join the
others.</p>

<p>He had scoured faithfully three sides of the lot, and now
directed his steps toward the lower corner, in which was a
spring, surrounded by marshy, boggy ground, a favorite
resort of the cattle in early spring, when they had the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> of the orchard. As he approached it, he heard a
plashing and trampling that surprised him somewhat; but
the scene he fronted, as he neared the spring, and held the
lantern up above his head, astonished him much more.
Amen, following close in his wake and watching him, writhing 
with silent laughter, from behind a bent old apple tree
near the spring, perhaps could have elucidated it considerably. 
For that abominable and crafty youth, watching
about at twilight for some mischief for the occupation of his
idle hands, had caught sight of Laura sauntering through

<!-- page 78 -->

the orchard, and being certain she was afraid of cows, had
determined upon giving her a fright. Instead, therefore,
of driving the cows down into the lower lot, he resolved to
turn them into the orchard and put up the bars softly,
which would at once terrify the young lady, and save himself
the trouble of escorting them to their usual dormitory.</p>

<p>With much skill and demure enjoyment, he carried out his
plan. Laura was kneeling down on some stones, pulling a
tuft of moss from the edge of the unused spring, and feeling
secure and very much isolated, when a sudden trampling of
hoofs, and the shaking sort of lowing that cattle make when
running, caught her ear, and starting up, she saw a dozen
cows or more making straight for her; for, impelled partly
by sticks and stones from Amen in the rear, and attracted
partly by the prospect of a drink from their favorite spring,
the deliberate troop agreed in making unusual speed toward 
that corner of the lot. Never imagining that their
motives were of this innocent nature, however, she sprang
up, and with a terrified shriek ran to the wall and essayed
to climb it. But unhappily her fright deprived her of the
little strength of which she was ordinarily mistress; the
close built wall presented an almost impassable barrier; but
clinging desperately to it, she had nearly mastered it, when
her foot slipped, the stone by which she was supporting
herself gave way, and she fell backward, the stone falling
too, and for a moment lay almost senseless from the sudden 
shock.</p>

<p>But a sharp pain in her foot, and the warm breath of an
inquisitive young heifer in her face, made her start up and
attempt to regain the wall. She was fain, however, to sink

<!-- page 79 -->

down again in agony; the stone had fallen on her foot, and
besides the sprain she had given it in slipping, it was badly
cut and bruised. Her screams could not reach the house
from where she was; indeed, she soon grew too faint to
try to make herself heard, and when, after a long and
dreadful hour, the welcome rays of Larry's lantern streamed
upon her, she was half-clinging to, half-crouching against the
wall, in the very corner of it, just where it intersected, her
white dress torn and stained, her straw hat lying at her feet,
the motley group of cattle standing in a semicircle round
her, some trampling the marshy ground as if to enjoy the
plashing of the water in the bogs, one or two sniffing in the
spring itself, others chewing the cud, all looking huge and
clumsy and strange by the lantern's light compared with
the slight, white figure shrinking away from them in such
mortal terror.</p>

<p>When she caught sight of Lawrence, her strained,
excited look of alarm gave way, and sinking down, she hid
her face in her hands and burst into tears. Larry scattered
her unwelcome attendants right and left, and with two
or three quick strides, annihilated the distance between
them.</p>

<p>"How did they get in here? Have they frightened
you?" he exclaimed, bending down to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, take me away, take me out of this horrible place,"
she sobbed.</p>

<p>He thought her babyish and silly, though he could not
help being sorry for her, till setting the lantern on the
ground, he caught sight of the blood staining her stocking
and skirt. With an exclamation of alarm, he picked up the

<!-- page 80 -->

little high-heeled shoe, lying half a yard off, muddy and
stained, and with the buckle broken quite in two.</p>

<p>"You are hurt," he cried, kneeling down by her.
"What has happened?"</p>

<p>She tried to tell him what had happened, and how she
was hurt, but she did not make much headway, and ended
by burying her face in her hands again and begging him,
in the most spoiled-child way, to take her to her aunt, to
take her away from this horrible place.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to carry her; it was plain
she could not walk, so taking the lantern in one hand, he
lifted her up in his strong arms and walked quickly toward
the house, rather silent, of course, but occasionally saying
something reassuring and kind.</p>

<p>Could it be possible this was the fine lady he had been so
much in awe of but two hours ago? She felt so light and
childish in his arms, with her head against his shoulder and
every half-soothed sob recording itself on his relenting
heart, that he began to wonder he had not seen at first
how sweet and unaffected she really was.</p>

<p>As he put down the lantern in the hall and entered the
open sitting-room door, he did not feel at all the bad-tempered 
fellow he had felt when he went out from that apartment 
only ten minutes before by the great clock in the
corner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawrence</span> began at last to think his pretty cousin was
inclined to make great capital of her sprained ankle; she
had totally upset the household on the night of the calamity,
and had hardly allowed it to resume its tone through the
whole of the next day; the zealous Nattee suspended all
her ordinary work, and Mrs. Sutherland looked as anxious
and dejected as if her young charge had broken all her
available limbs, instead of only having slightly sprained
one. For three days she remained in her room, with Warren, 
Nattee and Mrs. Sutherland in faithful attendance, so
it cannot be wondered that the young autocrat left alone
below stairs began to show signs of impatience and rebellion. 
It is all very well to consider the attentions of the

<!-- page 82 -->

womenkind at home as something of a nuisance, and to
bear them with a sort of lordly <i>noblesse-oblige</i> endurance;
but it is very ungracious and uncomfortable to have them
suddenly withdrawn without permission or solicitation of
any kind, and without one's having placed any just cause
or impediment in the way of their continuance. Larry had
not been obliged to go over the mountain since that first
day, and now that the haying was over there was not
any very pressing work to engage his attention. Such a
thorough-going young farmer as he of course was not idle;
but he came in the house long before supper-time now, and
was at leisure the whole of the evening.</p>

<p>He had imagined that perhaps she of the sprained
ankle would grace the settle in the sitting-room occasionally 
during her convalescence, and though he did not
acknowledge to himself that such a circumstance would
render that apartment more attractive, still he felt considerably 
irritated at the disappointment. No doubt she stayed
up stairs because she preferred it; that trashy sprain never
could require all that care; no doubt she thought he had
been altogether too cousinly and careless when he carried
her in that night, and meant to put him at his proper distance 
again. Coy little minx! he'd show her that the
distance he desired was even greater than the distance she
dictated; he would speedily convince her of how small
consequence he considered the cousinship between them,
and how very little difference her advent in the family
made to him.</p>

<p>Three days after this he came into the house half an hour
before supper-time. Having been superintending the cutting 

<!-- page 83 -->

of some timber below the creek, he had taken his gun
with him, and had employed the intervals of time in which
his superintendence was not required, in beating up the
neighboring thickets for partridge. Kelpie had started more
than one covey, and he had had some very good shots, and
had returned in that particular mood of easy good humor
that generally accompanies the feel of a heavy string of
birds over one's shoulder.</p>

<p>He came through the hall, whistling, as he went and
hung up his gun opposite the open sitting-room door, then
tossing his hat upon a chair, entered the room, swinging
the birds down from his shoulder and crossing over toward
the kitchen.</p>

<p>The table was arranged for supper; he gave a little start
as he glanced beyond it, and saw Laura on the settle by
the open window. Laura gave a little start, too, and
blushed a faint rose color all over her cheeks and forehead
and throat, but turned to alabaster again as he approached
her.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you're better," he said looking down
at her from his sublime height, but not offering to take her
hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she answered, faintly, very much relieved
that he did not; for her clever cousin had come pretty near
the truth in his speculations. Her recollections of the
adventure were very misty, but very mortifying.</p>

<p>"Which was the worst, after all, the fright or the
sprain?" he went on, with a wicked sort of smile playing
about the corners of his mouth. Laura had been made
such a heroine of and her sufferings treated with such

<!-- page 84 -->

respect, that this seemed intolerably presuming; she colored
up again and said distantly:</p>

<p>"It is difficult to choose between two such disagreeable
things," and turned away her head. Lawrence replaced
the book which, in her agitation, had slipped down at her
feet, and turned again toward the kitchen door. He left it
half open as he passed through, and the young lady
involuntarily glanced after him. Salome stood by the wide
fireplace, Nattee, on her knees before the coals, was making
toast. He flung the birds toward Salome, but Salome was
not quick enough, and they would have been prematurely
roasted, entirely <i>au naturel</i>, if Nattee, by an adroit gesture,
had not caught them before they fell.</p>

<p>"Let's have 'em for supper, Salome," he said carelessly,
going over to the dresser for a mug, and thence out a side
door across to the well, which was in full view of the
window where Laura sat, so she saw and heard the indifferent 
laugh with which he returned Salome's indignant
protest against his unreasonable request. Supper would
be ready in ten minutes&mdash;master would blow her head off
if he had to wait.</p>

<p>"Don't waste any more time scolding," he said, as he
drew up a dripping bucketful of water from the depths of
the deep well. "I must have 'em."</p>

<p>Salome scolded vehemently, but went about her preparations, 
while Nattee flew across to the step of the
kitchen-door with the birds in her apron, and sitting down
without a word, began to pick them. Her nimble fingers
paused though, once or twice, as the trickling blood
warned her she had reached the tiny death-wound that

<!-- page 85 -->

her master's hand had dealt. No ragged, mangled flesh;
there wasn't such a shot in all the country round as Master
Larry; she could tell the birds he'd taken down, if half the
men on the place had been out shooting with him. But
the poor things, with their drooping, dangling heads!</p>

<p>There was within the roughly inclosed well, a coarse
brown towel on a roller, and a great tin basin stood below
it on a bench, where the men washed nightly when they
came in from the field. The towel was renewed every
afternoon, and hung fresh and crisp, with the folds still on
it, and the basin was shiny and clean; so Larry, after he
had filled his mug and drank it off with relish, filled this
too, and stooping down, with both hands dashed the water
into his face, and deliberately washed his hands, and then
as deliberately dried both face and hands on the coarse
brown towel, and shaking back the short, wet curls on his
forehead, and turning down his sleeves, he re&euml;ntered the
house, seeming to consider his toilet made. There was
possibly some bravado about this, for he generally went
into his own room to wash, and he was not ignorant of the
view the sitting-room window commanded.</p>

<p>When he re&euml;ntered that apartment, he reached down,
from the deers' horns over the sideboard, a fishing-pole and
reel that resided there, and seating himself, began tinkering 
at them with much appearance of interest. It was not
fair to say he whistled; it was not an actual whistle, only a
low occasional suggestion of a tune from lips pressed
together with their earnestness over the work in hand, but
it was sufficient to make Laura feel almost angry enough to
cry. He had so entirely forgotten she existed, she was

<!-- page 86 -->

fully at liberty to look at him now, and that with all the
dislike he merited.</p>

<p>Kelpie came whining and snuffing about his legs, and got
a careless kick for her pains, after which she withdrew
under his chair, and with her nose on the lowest round,
and one silky ear dangling over it, watched him silently,
and started and looked fondly sympathizing when something 
broke with a snap, and a low "bother!" escaped
his lips.</p>

<p>"Nattee," he called out in a louder tone, "run up to my
room and get that box of tackle on the shelf, it's on top of
a lot of books and things, I think."</p>

<p>"I know, sir;" and Nattee was on the stairs almost
before the sentence was finished. When she came back
with the box, she stood a moment looking at his work with
interest and appreciation.</p>

<p>"You'll have to wax that thread," she said after a
moment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned, meditatively. "It would be better.
Get me some, will you?"</p>

<p>While she waxed the thread, he asked her if she had
picked the birds.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and they're on to broil."</p>

<p>"Well, then, stay and hold this for me."</p>

<p>Nattee understood the work quite as well as he did, and
slipping down on the floor at his feet, lashed the broken
line together very dexterously, while he held the other end
tightly on his knee. Kelpie put her soft fore-paws a little
too far out from her retreat, and Nattee, in the pride of
her heart, gave her a sharp reprimand, and went on eagerly

<!-- page 87 -->

with her delightful work. While Laura, in her stately
heart, despised both dog and slave.</p>

<p>Nattee's pleasure, however, was but short-lived, as is the
nature of pleasure. A heavy, shambling step in the hall
made her start a little and pause uneasily.</p>

<p>"Master'll be wanting his supper; he's coming in. I
guess I'd better go."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lawrence, acquiescently, "I can as well
finish it by myself."</p>

<p>The young Indian was as good at making haste as most
of her race, but fate was a second too quick for her this
time. Kelpie had been quietly gnawing at the line, and
untwisted it a yard or two; in starting up, her feet got
entangled in it, and as her master appeared at the door, the
box of fishing tackle became involved in the general ruin,
and hooks, lines, reels, floats and sinkers spread themselves
entirely across the entrance. With trembling haste, poor
Nattee, kneeling down, stretched out her hands to collect
and restore them to order.</p>

<p>For one moment the old man stood still in the door and
watched her. Laura had followed his eyes from the
unready table up to the tall clock in the corner, then back
to the trembling girl on the floor. Her very blood seemed
to freeze as she saw the dull glare of rage that filled them
as they settled on her, and his grasp tightened on the
heavy riding-whip in his hand. He brought it down on
the bare, extended arms below him with a quick, galling
cut, and Laura only saw the girl press her arms to her
breast, and with a face convulsed with pain, dart from the
room, before a sickening faintness came over her, and

<!-- page 88 -->

forced her to hide her eyes in the pillow. She did not see
the glance of menace and wrath that passed between father
and son; the stolid look of ugliness with which the former
turned away, and going to the sideboard, poured out a
heavy glass of liquor, and drank it off at a draught; nor
the suppressed scorn on the young man's face, as he strode
angrily once or twice across the room, then stooped to
pick up the scattered contents of the box.</p>

<p>When the horn sounded for supper, and Warren came
in, Laura put her arms around his neck, and begged him to
take her to her room; she did not want anything to eat,
she only wanted to be by herself. Poor Mrs. Sutherland
was infinitely distressed at the change of plan, but Laura had
not yet learned self-control enough to endure the sight of
the ugly old man, so fresh from such an act, nor the idea
of being served by poor Nattee, yet smarting from his
cruelty. The recital of it to Warren, when he came up
after supper to sit by her in the long, gradual twilight,
brought on a new burst of homesickness, for she was still
weak and unnerved since the accident that had confined
her to the house.</p>

<p>"I am so afraid of him," she whispered, "the cruel old
man! Oh, Warren, you <i>will</i> not go away and leave me!"</p>

<p>"No," Warren said, sadly. "I am not going yet. I
will write to-night to the Rector for a longer leave of
absence. Perhaps I can be excused from entering on my
duties in New York till after Christmas&mdash;perhaps altogether. 
Do not despair, Laura. Let us watch if some
good does not come out of all this darkness. Let us see
what is our duty here. Beginning from this very night,

<!-- page 89 -->

can you not see how much you may be able to achieve?
Think how Aunt Andria needs your affection and sympathy;
and this poor Nattee, who has attached herself so
strongly to you&mdash;you may be able to teach her the only
truths that can reconcile her to her lot. As for myself, I
begin to doubt whether there is any place that needs me
more. The wretched ignorance of the slaves on this farm
and on the neighboring ones, and of the scattering Indian
settlements around, make me sometimes feel I have no
right to go away&mdash;no right to turn my back upon this first
field to which I have been led."</p>

<p>"But what can one do?" said Laura, almost fretfully.
"Such a horrible old man as this&mdash;he will retard any good
work he gains a suspicion of&mdash;he will do everything to
hinder you. And that selfish, tyrannical, overbearing Lawrence&mdash;oh, 
let them alone&mdash;let us go to New York!"</p>

<p>"Laura, this is not like you; this is not like the courage
and devotion that brought you here. Think a moment,
my sister, of the danger of refusing any duty that lies before
you. Think if you can honestly say, 'We are not needed
here: we can do no good.' Do you know that we <i>are</i>
needed in New York? Do you think that there, in the
very centre of the missionary interest of the country, there
can be as dreary a dearth of Christianity as here? And
can you persuade yourself that a city such as that has as
natural and clear a claim upon you as this, the first home in
America of your father's family? This vast tract of land
has borne our name for many years, and will bear it, no
doubt, long after we have left it, selfishly or righteously.
And with our name, our influence and responsibility will

<!-- page 90 -->

continue to exist. We cannot shake that off: we must
settle it in our own minds whether we will brave the
danger of the sin. Are you strong enough for that, Laura?
Are you ready to say you give up, your burden here is
heavier than you can bear&mdash;right or wrong you will be
eased of it, right or wrong you will escape this discipline,
turn your back upon this trial?"</p>

<p>"Warren," murmured Laura, turning away, "you are
almost cruel."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am, Laura," he continued, speaking quickly
and huskily; "perhaps I have been cruel to you always. I
don't know how it is all to end. I thought I meant well.
I think we came honestly away from pleasure and temptation. 
I know you put your hand in mine and followed me
humbly and obediently. The fault is mine, if I have led
you wrong. Go yet a little further, Laura. Let the
sacrifice to duty be entire. Don't shrink from giving up a
little more where you have staked so much. Think of the
nothingness of it all, Laura&mdash;all this tempting world!
Think how little it will seem in the day that may be mercifully 
near to you and me! Comfort, pleasure, ambition,
love&mdash;what will they seem then in comparison with the
dreadful sight of one neglected duty, with its long train of
evil&mdash;one unconverted soul that lay uncared for within our
reach? Think a moment, Laura; what is this trial that we
think so cruel, to the trials of that noble army with whom
we hope one day to stand? Will you be willing then to
think any have loved Christ better than you&mdash;any have
served him more entirely? That will be the one ambition
then. All hope, all desire, will have but that one object;

<!-- page 91 -->

all memories will be worse than blank that have no coloring
of love to Him; all pleasure will be pain that was enjoyed
without His blessing; all ease be torture that usurped the
place of duty. The woe, the terror, the shame&mdash;Laura,
can you bear the thought?"</p>

<p>He had risen and walked up and down the room while
he was speaking, and now stood still before her by the
window, the fading light all centring on his pale, compressed 
features and dilating eyes. It was not fear of him,
though, nor love of him, that gave her voice the steadiness
it had when at last she answered him, turning her face
away, and gazing out into the gathering gloom:</p>

<p>"No, Warren, I cannot bear the thought. I will stay
here&mdash;I will try to do my duty."</p>

<p>Trying to do one's duty, however, is notoriously easier
business than actually doing it; it is child's play to resolve
compared with the dire work it is to do. Laura's thoughtful 
eyes, though they saw as far into futurity as young eyes
often see, were not open to all the weary way that lay
before her in the path she had resolved to take. To be the
patient enlightener of poor Nattee's rayless night, the
cheerful companion of her aunt's sad lot, the unprovoked
witness of her uncle's wanton ugliness of speech and look,
required the grace of the saint added to the gentleness of
the woman. And though her great sacrifice and her daily
efforts brought her nearer to it every hour, Laura was not
a saint yet.</p>

<p>In due time, a reply to Warren's letter came. He was
released from his engagement as assistant minister of
Trinity; the former incumbent had determined still to

<!-- page 92 -->

retain his charge, and he was free to remain where he was.
He had not waited for this, however, to review the ground
for the scene of his new ministry; and more unpromising
ground, it would seem, could hardly have been found. In
his uncle's house, he had to encounter the callous stubbornness 
that years of indifference to religion in master and
dependents had bred&mdash;a stubbornness far more formidable
than the genuine ignorance of the Indians and early settlers. 
Ralph Sutherland had left all care for the things of
his soul behind him when he came to America. His was a
household governed by no principle more safe and holy
than his own unshackled will; and his wife had early
learned that the inmost cell of her homesick heart was the
only chapel where she could ever hope to worship the God
of her fathers. How it came that Lawrence was correct
and well-balanced in matters of faith, could only be
accounted for on the supposition that he rejected upon
principle all the prejudices of his father, and learned sympathetically 
from his timid and silent mother the creed she
had hardly dared to teach him to pronounce.</p>

<p>A tremendous freshet of Methodism had flooded the
country a few years before the commencement of this story,
and had swept along with it all the floating faith of the
neighborhood. It had eddied harmlessly, however, round
the homes of the sturdy old burghers, who had brought
over their Dutch faith as well as their Dutch tile from
Holland with them, and beat harmlessly at the doors of
the Sutherland mansion; but the scattering emigrants from
the old country, who had followed in the train of the
wealthier settlers of these rich bottom lands of the Catskills,

<!-- page 93 -->

and the Indians and negroes, who owned no other
faith, had been entirely carried away by it. A small
meeting-house, beyond the bridge, had been at first filled
to overflowing, and was still filled with a fluctuating crowd,
according to the gift of the resident preacher.</p>

<p>The present pastor of this mongrel flock was esteemed a
man of more than ordinary talent. His predecessor had
been a mild, patient preacher of a very useful but unexciting 
Gospel, and his hearers had thinned so surely from
Sunday to Sunday, that about a year before a little new
leaven had been esteemed a necessity. And very strong
leaven the Reverend Pertinax Pound had proved, and in
an incredibly short space the whole lump had fermented
beyond belief. The Rev. Pertinax, being too working an
ingredient for the better regulated, slower masses of the
mother country, had early, from prudential motives, it was
presumed, emigrated to this more congenial clime, where,
after some twenty years of conscientious agitating, he
found himself a leading and controlling member of his
zealous sect. He possessed, floating somewhere around,
now in New England, now in New York, now in Virginia,
a wife, who did not forget him, and some half dozen well-grown, 
stalwart sons. Some of them preached and some
of them ploughed, but all were unmistakable fractions of
the stout old block from which they had been chipped.
The strangest part of all the strange history of this family
was, that after all their notorious slighting of the ties of
nature that bind families together, they neither forgot nor
ceased to love each other.</p>

<p>The mother, a great, gaunt, iron-willed woman, lived

<!-- page 94 -->

sometimes for months together in her dreary cabin in the
mountains, utterly alone and unprotected, save when an
occasional son dropped in upon her, with his axe on his
shoulder and his Bible in his pocket, <i>en route</i> for some new
field of labor; or when sometimes she put the key of the
cabin in her pocket, and tramped off, hundreds of miles, till
she reached her husband, and heard of the wonders the
Lord was working by his hand. There was but one purse
and one heart between them all, and though the purse was
but a slim one, and the heart but a grim one, there was a
majesty and strength about the union.</p>

<p>Incendiary and agitator as he knew him to be, Warren
Sutherland felt, from the first moment of their meeting,
that he stood in the presence of a man who, however mistaken 
and misled, was as sincere as himself, and perhaps
more earnest, in the business of saving souls. There is no
fear, between two men solely and unselfishly devoted to
such a cause, and serving the same Master, only from
unworldly love of that Master, of personal enmities and
petty strifes. Between two such there can be no dissimulation; 
they recognize the badge that each wears in his
heart; they both are enlisted in a service that breeds
jealousy only as the original love for it dies out; they may
hate the errors that mar the creed of the other, but,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Christ's mark outwears the rankest blot;"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>they cannot hate each other. And so it came to pass that
the young English divine, fresh from the straitest school of
his religion, and the staunch old hero of a hundred heretical 
fights, grasped each other's hands on the threshold of

<!-- page 95 -->

this new field, and read "Christian" in each other's eyes.
Not that one lost sight, however, for a moment, of the
other's errors of belief. The Reverend Pertinax pounded
new anathemas from his well-worn pulpit against the pomps
and vanities, the forms and ceremonies of the dying church
from which he had come out; while the Reverend Warren,
gathering his little flock about him, bade them pray earnestly 
the prayer against heresy and schism, and showed
them the true beauty of the form of sound words they held,
and the safety and sublimity of the faith that had descended
to them from the Saints. Not much headway, however,
did the younger man for awhile seem to make in the propounding 
of his more refined and quiet creed to his
untaught hearers. It was very much easier to rant and
rave and shout glory, than to learn rationally what glory
meant, and what was the best and wisest way of gaining a
hope of it. And besides the natural opposition of the
unregenerate heart to the exact discipline it requires, was
to be added the wholesale opposition to all religious efforts
of the great man of the place, and the great man of the
preacher's family.

Ralph Sutherland was not one to bear quietly the emanating 
from his household of anything that savored of the
system to which he had long avowed his hatred, and
Warren was soon taught what he must expect. They were
welcome to a home in his house, they might spend their
lives there if they chose; but as to tampering with his
servants, starting schools or holding services on his premises, 
he warned them to desist from any thought of it; he
forbade the least suggestion of it. The moment he caught

<!-- page 96 -->

a hint of it, his hospitality should end; they must seek
another home. Family prayers, catechism of the slaves,
Sunday services, were severally and distinctly refused and
placed under the ban of his heaviest displeasure.</p>

<p>"I can but wait and try to melt his prejudices," thought
Warren, with a patient sigh. "He is the head of the
house; I must submit while I am here. If he remains
inexorable, I must find Laura and myself another home."</p>

<p>And to waiting, that hardest kind of service, he was
faithful for two long, weary months; when, at the end of
that time, his uncle suddenly and ungraciously gave in to
his desires, and agreed to relinquish his determined opposition. 
Warren knew there must be a moving cause for
such a revolution as this, but was at a loss in which direction 
to look for it.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had been at Grey Dirck's heels on the
evening of the 28th of August, as the morose old man
untethered him from the white birch by the creek, half way
on the lonely road from the Stadt to the village, he would
not have been at so great a loss to divine his uncle's
motives. If he had seen the diminished package of letters
replaced in the saddle-bags, and the cautious look around
the old man gave before he stooped down and scattered
the handful of tiny white bits of paper he held, on the
tumbling, foaming creek as it hurried by, he might have
hazarded a conjecture that news from home had something
to do with his uncle's sudden yielding; that news from
home had made their staying at the farm a thing to be
desired and plotted for. And if he had seen the ugly look
of satisfaction that settled round his hard mouth, uglier

<!-- page 97 -->

even than his look of anger, as he mounted and rode away,
glancing back through the gathering twilight at the white
flakes hurrying down the creek, he would at once have
feared and wondered.</p>

<p>The saddle-bag was lighter by three of the weight of
letters with which it had started from the Stadt, and the
Catskill was heavier by two. They did not seem to lie
heavy, though, on the seared conscience of him who knew
their whereabouts; the law document buttoned up within
his surtout was only a burden as it had to be concealed,
only a sin when it should find him out.</p>

<p>Nor did they seem to lie heavy on the heart of the Catskill 
either, as they fluttered and danced and hurried away
with its swiftly receding waters. Pale ghosts of the love
that had sent them, cold phantoms of the hopes that hung
on them, they had stopped just short of their haven, and
sailed faithlessly back toward the great river that had
brought them from the sea. Now lagging in some smooth
inlet, now eddying round some jutting rock, or drawn
shuddering over some swift waterfall, they glanced and
flashed all night long in the moonlight, ghost-like and white
and faithless. And ghost-like and white and faithless grew
the hope in Warren Sutherland's heart, as this night chilled
it with vague disappointment and renewed regret.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> Ralph Sutherland had started for the Stadt at
three o'clock that afternoon, Laura had been counting the
hours with ill-controlled impatience. She had not allowed
herself to hope for letters from home till now, but to-day
<i>must</i> bring them. Last week's mail had come without
bringing news of any foreign arrival, but every one said
some ship must have reached ere this. Ralph had held
one of his long old-country talks with Warren in the morning, 
and at dinner had announced his intention of riding
down for the mail himself, instead of sending Amen, whose
weekly duty it had lately been.</p>

<p>"Would he be back before supper?" Laura had asked
timidly of Lawrence after dinner. "Doubtful," he had
answered, carelessly, as he walked off toward the barn.
But the doubt had settled into a certainty as the long afternoon 
wore away, and the horn for supper sounded, and the
twilight came slowly and surely on.</p>

<p>It had been a genuine August day, thick, close and hot,
and the sun had gone down looking dusky red and giving

<!-- page 99 -->

every promise of repeating himself to-morrow; the family
had one by one strayed out among the grass and shrubbery
in front of the house, and tried to imagine dew where
there was none, and refreshment that was not to come
that thirsty night.</p>

<p>The sleepless insects filled the thick air with their hot
dry chirp; not the faintest breath of wind stirred the languid 
flowers; rest and motion, idleness and occupation,
were alike discomfort. Mrs. Sutherland was the only one
of the group who did not yield to the impatient, fruitless
impulse to better herself, and sat quietly knitting just
within the door; Larry walked about the paths or lay at
full length on the grass, equally uncomfortable and equally
irritable in every attitude; Warren, resolutely self-controlled, 
looked wan and ill as he paced up and down the
walk before the door, while Laura, quite renouncing self
control, pulled the flowers of the creeper to atoms where
they grew within her reach, or clashed her fan open and
shut impatiently, as she sauntered to the gate and back
twenty times in the course of a half hour, looking vainly
for the desired approach of Grey Dirck and his grisly
rider. Nattee, leaning out of the dining-room window, or
stealing about on unnecessary and self-imposed embassies
around the yard, perhaps did not feel the heat so much
through her clear, thick, sun-proof skin, as she felt the
intangible magnetic oppression of the night, so full of some
inexplicable discomfort. Nattee's clothes did not feel too
tight for her, either, as her well-dressed betters' clothes
felt, for they barely touched her free limbs anywhere; but
sympathetically and unconsciously, she felt uncomfortable

<!-- page 100 -->

and unhappy, restless and impatient. Master Larry was
cross, Master Warren was silent. Miss Laura neither noticed
nor spoke to her.</p>

<p>At last, however, a hope flashed through the darkness
of her discouragement. Her quick eyes caught sight, far
down the road, of her master's approach; to be the bearer
of that intelligence surely must bring the reward of a smile
from Miss Laura. So darting through the shrubbery that
intervened between her and the family group, she startled
them by appearing suddenly before them and exclaiming,
"Massa's 'most here, Miss Laura!"</p>

<p>She was rewarded by seeing Miss Laura start forward
excitedly, spilling the glass of water she was just taking
from Lawrence's hand, and hurry toward the gate, utterly
ignoring gratitude to the bearer of the intelligence and
apologies to her cousin. Nattee saw the ominous dark red
flush dawn on his face as he watched the flutter of her
white dress down the path, and gazed fascinated at his
gathering wrath, till, as usual, it burst on her own head.
Spoiled Mr. Lawrence Sutherland did not like to be looked
at when he was out of temper, as who does? And when
he found the dark, eager eyes of the slave bent silently and
curiously on his face, no one at all at home in his position
can wonder that he sent her fluttering off to the house with
a ringing reprimand for her loitering and impertinence, and
despised himself for it the next instant, and hated the sight
of her for the next week, as suggestive of a self-reproach.</p>

<p>The self-reproach, however, she never heard of; the sudden, 
harsh rebuke was never softened, and choking back
her tears, poor Nattee crept miserably into the house, only

<!-- page 101 -->

certain of one thing in the perplexing, uncomfortable world
in which she found herself, and that was, that, do what she
might, she was certain to do wrong.</p>

<p>Laura's courage failed as she reached the gate; she did
not dare to stop her uncle and ask him for the letters, and
without looking toward her, he rode past, and up to the
barn. There were none of the men in sight, so dismounting, 
he fastened Dirck's halter to the nearest post, and
walked slowly down toward the cow-yard, ostensibly to
superintend the milking, but really to work up as much as
practicable the temper of the young lady he had seen waiting 
at the gate. After some ten long-drawn minutes, however, 
he walked slowly back again, purposely avoiding the
front gate, and going in at the kitchen door. This was
unendurable; running across the grass, Laura followed
him over the threshold, and coming up behind him, said,
timidly:</p>

<p>"Uncle, did you find any letters for us?"</p>

<p>He said, "What?" looked as if he did not know who
she was or what she was talking about, but finally remembered, 
gruffly, there were some in one of the saddle-bags
on Dirck's back.</p>

<p>For no permission did she wait, but flying out again,
paused neither for breath nor reflection till she stood by
the stable door. Just outside of it, haltered to a post,
stood Dirck. And a more unassuring object to approach,
with the one exception of his master, the young lady never
remembered to have confronted. She made a little motion
to advance, but the great brute, with one effort straightening 
the halter out to its extreme length, stood with his head

<!-- page 102 -->

slightly raised, one hoof just lifted from the ground, and
the villainous intelligence of his eye fixed full upon her.
She shrank back of course, and looked hurriedly around for
somebody to help her; but Warren, with his back to her,
was pacing the walk as she had left him, suffering inward
tortures of impatience, but outwardly self-controlled and
quiet. Lawrence she would not call, though he was within
sound of her voice, which Warren was not. He always
had a laugh in his eye when her fear of the animals was
alluded to; besides, she would never stoop to ask any
favor of him, and she was ashamed, too, to let him hear
her call to Nattee. None of the men were in sight; they
never were when they were wanted.</p>

<p>She stood for some seconds, fluttering with fear and
indecision, not daring to advance and not resigned to
retreat, when it occurred to her she should be braver if
she got that horrible eye off her; so she described a small
circle, and essayed to approach him from the rear. But
with Satanic sagacity, just as she neared him, he backed
off, and twisted the halter till he brought a three-quarter
face to bear upon her. She retreated two steps and gasped
for breath. This was aggravating, indeed, but she must,
she would have those letters. With parted lips and quickened 
breath, she advanced two steps and put out her hand,
at which Dirck backed again, more suddenly and more
portentously than before, bringing each individual iron
down upon the ground with an emphasis which shook it
sensibly.</p>

<p>This time she fled, in palpitating terror, to the adjacent
shelter of the barn; half crying with vexation and half

<!-- page 103 -->

fainting with fright, she leaned against the door-post and
looked fearfully back upon him. Her curiosity and
impatience, however, at length sustained her in another
sortie. On this occasion, Dirck made no demonstration
with his hoofs, but as she stole up toward him, he slightly
lowered and advanced his head.</p>

<p>Not suddenly, not violently; but before the expression
of that fiery eye and that distended nostril, iron and
muscle paled their ineffectual fires; she screamed and
clasped her hands together and ran back, only checked
in her precipitate retreat by Lawrence's approach. Leaning 
over the gate, he had watched the little farce, till he
had forgiven, on the ground of her extreme prettiness
alone, the pretty coward who had just aggravated him so
bitterly; and resolving he didn't care a rush who her
letters came from, nor why she wanted them, and voting
himself a good fellow for his resolution, he had come to
the rescue.</p>

<p>"What is it you want from the saddle-bag?" he said
carelessly, as she stopped trembling before him.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the letters."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, I'll get them for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Laura meekly, and waited.</p>

Lawrence went up to Dirck, who had begun to move
restlessly up and down, and pull at his halter, and bringing
his open hand heavily down on the horse's muscular
haunch, he arrested all further movement effectually, and
plunging his hand into the saddle-bag, brought up the
coveted package. He watched narrowly the young lady's
expression as he approached her; gratitude, kindness,

<!-- page 104 -->

coquetry, no; her eyes never got above the package in his
hands. He raised it for a moment, and held it from her,
as if to make her speak or look at him; but the childish,
hungry eyes followed it alone, and almost tossing it into
her hands, he turned contemptuously away.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark, and Laura, springing into the hall,
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"A light, Nattee, a light&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>And Warren, after a moment, quietly followed. If he
saw at all the superscription of the letters, as he bent over
them, he saw them with the eyes of his soul, for his actual
vision was blurred and dim with the strong excitement
that he held in such stern check.</p>

<p>"There are yours, Warren," cried Laura, pushing three
over to him, and eagerly tearing open her own.</p>

He sat down and leaned his head back on the chair for a
moment, then put out his hand and took up the first letter
it touched. It was from the Society's secretary, and he
read it through twice without deriving much satisfaction
or enlightenment from the reading. The fact was, the
reverend gentleman hadn't much to say, and he said it
wordily and pompously. The second letter was from the
old clerk of Borringdon church, quaint and prosy; but each
toppling, high-backed word sent a homesick pain through
the reader's heart; the old parish names, that were so
ringingly familiar, and the old parish troubles and bickerings, 
that were lately of such interest, took him back,
all through the weary length of his trial, to the home and
pleasures that were dead to him forever. Beyond parish
difficulties, however, the writer did not get, except to

<!-- page 105 -->

record the intelligence that the family had not yet returned
to the park, and were not expected for some time, and
then he signed himself, "Your Reverence's obedient
servant, Abraham Murdoch."</p>

<p>The third and last letter was from Mr. Edward Barclay,
and was dated Genoa. The gouty uncle, on whom all his
hopes were fastened, had suddenly found himself restlessly
inclined, and Edward had concluded to be restlessly
inclined too. So they were jogging about the continent
as suited the caprice and comfort of the old gentleman,
and how long it would be before they returned to
England, the nephew could venture no sort of calculation.
"It behooves me, my dear fellow, you see," he wrote, "to
put my impatience in my pocket, where humoring <i>mon
oncle</i> is concerned. I only hope he will not take it into
his head to spend the balance of his days abroad, and ruin
my prospects at the bar. In any case, however, I know
you'll agree, I have honestly earned whatever little
souvenir he may accord me in his will, even to the whole
of his estate. Apropos of uncles, I see by the papers
from home to-day, old Col. Sutherland is dead. I think,
however, you gave me to understand, you had nothing
to hope for in that quarter, so I need not build upon
seeing you recalled from your Quixotic enterprise, to
take possession of his comfortable acres, and preach the
gospel to English sinners, who, taking him for an example, 
I can't help thinking, need it as much as Indian
sinners.

"A few days before I left London, I dined with our
common friends in Portland Place. You and your recent

<!-- page 106 -->

departure were spoken of and generally regretted. I had
the honor of taking to dinner Sir Charles' pretty cousin,
Miss Gregory. What a beauty she is, to be sure! I do
not wonder at Sir Charles."</p>

<p>"Who is your letter from, Laura?"</p>

<p>Laura felt the weariness and disappointment of his tone,
and there was weary disappointment in her own, as she said,
handing the open sheet to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only Mrs. Holt."</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt, her dear old governess, wrote a very kind
and affectionate letter, but it did not fill up the measure
of her anticipated pleasure; it just showed her, other
letters might have come, and had not&mdash;that other people
might have remembered her, and had not. Rather a silent
and lifeless party sat around the table, for the hour that
remained of their accustomed evening. Lawrence read
the "Independent Reflector" of the week before, and
made no comment, and Warren read the English papers,
and offered none. Laura read the unsatisfactory letters
over and over again, and at last, silent and spiritless, went
across the room, and sat by the open window, leaning
against the casement, and looking out into the hot, still
night. Her uncle, lying back in his great chair opposite,
slept, or affected sleep, and there was no one to see or to
reproach her for the slow tears that gathered in her eyes.
The darkness without was welcomer than the light within,
and she did not move from her first attitude, till startled
by a pair of eyes gleaming through the bushes beside the
window.</p>

<p>It was only Amen, and nobody was ever surprised to see

<!-- page 107 -->

Amen anywhere, so she took no further notice of him than
to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where have you been since dinner, boy? Nattee has
been hunting for you everywhere."</p>

<p>The imp sniggered and twisted, and availed himself of
that weighty arm of defence wielded solely by them of
Africa, a grinning silence. White servants generally ruin
themselves by their bungling excuses and evasions, but
black ones, richer in inherent cunning, hold their tongues,
and drive their accusers to the wall. It was useless to
interrogate Amen. He wriggled and chuckled and
remained speechless, even under the lash, and old Sutherland, 
held to be a master in the art of reduction, had
never got a word out of him when he chose to play that
part. There was no higher satisfaction in thrashing him
than in thrashing so much india-rubber, and the old man
was too thorough a sensualist to pursue what gave him so
little gratification, and Amen, now-a-days, not only shirked
the work, but shirked the whipping too, and held his
tongue or talked, just as seemed agreeable to him. On this
occasion, after finding that holding his tongue did not aggravate 
Miss Laura, he began to talk with a view to that end.</p>

<p>"I've been so scared, Miss Laura," he whimpered, "I've
seen ghosts."</p>

<p>Miss Laura's eyes looked as if she saw ghosts too, out
in the darkness, ghosts that saddened more than scared her,
but she did not speak. He crept along up to the window,
and putting his arms on the sill, and peering into the room,
went on speaking in a stage whisper, which was audible in
every corner.</p>

<!-- page 108 -->

<p>"When I was comin' across lots, from the mowin' field
down there, I stopped at the creek to get a drink, just by
the ole white birch&mdash;and what d'ye think, Miss Laura&mdash;what 
d'ye think? Little white ghosts was floatin' all over
the water, jumpin' up an' down, some of 'em flying in the
air, some of 'em stickin' to the stones an' grass. Oh, ye
never see the like. I'm all of a tremble, I'm so scared!"</p>

<p>And laying his head down on his arms, he leered about
the room, and shook with silent laughter, as he saw the old
man in his chair start and mutter, then compose himself
hurriedly to his pretended sleep.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see one. Miss Laura?" he went on,
with his eye on his master's face. "I caught a lot and
put 'em in my pocket. I've got 'em here&mdash;put out your
hand&mdash;don't be scared"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But at this moment the sleeper rose and shook himself,
and throwing a muttered curse at the boy, bade him take
himself off to bed. The boy whined, as he limped off, casting 
a villainous look back at his master.</p>

<p>"You never seed'm, them there ghosts, I s'pose, massa,
did ye?"</p>

<p>Seeing his uncle fully awake, Warren rose and handed
him a paper containing the news he felt uncomfortable
about communicating; not that he anticipated any demonstration 
of grief from the old man at his brother's death,
but that he dreaded hearing some gross and angry imprecations 
on his memory, and to Warren the defenceless dead
were sacred. In this, however, he was somewhat disappointed. 
His uncle sat down and read the announcement
silently, pondered thoughtfully on it for several minutes,

<!-- page 109 -->

then pushing the paper away from him said grimly as he
rose:</p>

<p>"Well, he's gone to his long account, and his going or
his staying makes little odds to me&mdash;and little odds to you,
either, I'm thinking, lad."</p>

<p>He did not desire or wait for an answer, but after he
had left the room, Warren said thoughtfully, "That is
truer than I like to think." Lawrence, laying down his
paper, asked, "How long since you have seen Col. Sutherland?"</p>

<p>"Never since I was a lad; nothing could induce him to
come to our house or to be reconciled to my father; but he
once sent an invitation to my mother to let us come to him
on a visit. Do you remember it, Laura? It was a grim
time, and Laura cried night and day till she was taken
home. I was braver, and stood it out a little longer, but
neither of us felt any inclination to try his hospitality again;
though I have sometimes thought the old man was hungering 
more than he chose to own for sympathy and companionship. 
I really think he yearned after little Laura, though
she was so homesick, and liked her honesty in not concealing 
it more than resented its occurrence."</p>

<p>"Poor, unhappy gentleman!" said Laura, coming to the
table and leaning against Warren's chair; "how strange
that we should know so little of him, and care so little for
his death."</p>

<p>"I do not think we can blame ourselves; his prejudices,
to call them by their mildest name, were such as necessarily 
cut him off from our companionship. No one, calling
himself a Christian, could submit to be guided by him,

<!-- page 110 -->

and guide he would all whom he admitted to his hospitality."</p>

<p>"What becomes of his property?" asked Lawrence.</p>

<p>"His intention, I think, has been to found a hospital,
though I am not sure that he had fully developed the plan
before his death. He has made no secret, however, of his
firm determination that not a farthing of it shall come to
any one bearing the name of Sutherland; so I presume we
are not at all interested, personally, in the matter of its disposal. 
But one cannot help feeling a wish that so much
money should be well bestowed, and a curiosity to know
the result of such a man's hours of solitude and reflection."</p>

<p>Long after Laura had given her good-night kiss to her
brother, and her good-night courtesy to her cousin, the two
young men sat together talking over this family news, and
the reminiscences it awakened. Both, however, were very
imperfectly acquainted with the history of the last generation 
of Sutherlands; Warren had only heard his father's
story, and Lawrence had heard nothing but what was
casual and inadvertent. If they could have known the
truth, they would have saved themselves some wonder and
perplexity.</p>

<p>Colonel Sutherland was the eldest of three sons of a well-born 
country gentleman of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire, the entail of whose
estate stopped with this generation. Fortunately, perhaps,
for successive growths of extravagant owners had worn it
down to the quick, and to have restored it to its proper
state would have required more money than the whole property 
of the Sutherland family, personal and real, would
have brought under the hammer of the auctioneer. The

<!-- page 111 -->

heir, disgusted at the barren acres and bare coffers coming
to him, entered the army, and was absent many years on
foreign duty. At the age of thirty-two he returned to find
his parents dead, his second brother settled as rector of a
country parish not many miles from their native shire, and
his youngest brother, Ralph, the self-appointed agent of the
family estate. The acres were not quite so barren as formerly, 
but the coffers were barer, if the thing was possible;
woodland had been cleared, the boundaries of the farm had
been curtailed, tenants had been oppressed and ground
down, all that the land could yield had been extracted from
it, young Ralph had lived in a niggardly and pinching
manner in one of the smallest houses on the estate, the
family mansion had been long closed, and all the family servants 
had been dismissed, and yet there was no accumulation 
of rents or produce to be rendered to the suddenly-returned 
master; no account to be made to him of the five
years' income of his farm.</p>

<p>Colonel Sutherland, though not a man of business, was a
man of keenness and decision, and from the moment he saw
the old young man, whom he had left an undeveloped boy&mdash;with 
his hard dry manner and his ugly eye&mdash;he distrusted 
and despised him, and resolved to leave no stone
unturned, and to spare no vigilance, in investigating and
bringing to the light his transactions since their father's
death. And the result was the discovery that he had been
cheated and outwitted, that he had hardly a third of his
estate remaining, and that, without a hopeless blackening of
the family name before the world, he could have no redress,
and must bear, with what patience he was master of, the

<!-- page 112 -->

villainy of his brother and the loss of his property. Whispers, 
to be sure, of the cause of Ralph's sudden departure
for America got abroad; forgery and manifold villainies, it
was rumored, had aroused the high-tempered heir beyond
reason and endurance, and in the stormy scene that had
ended their reckonings, the life of the younger had nearly
paid the forfeit of his foul deeds.</p>

<p>However that may have been, Col. Sutherland was from
that time a changed and embittered man. He had come
back from his long wanderings, through all of which he had
carried a soldier's love of home deep and sacred in his heart,
to find treachery and meanness waiting for him there, and the
blow that this disappointment dealt, he could not meet with
Christianity nor bear with humbleness. Honor had been
his only god, and insulted, now cried day and night in his
ears the dangerous lesson of implacable resentment. The
large-hearted, charity-loving rector never could be brought
to think the evil of his younger brother that the elder
thought. He was unworldly and trusting, and Ralph had
always been obsequious and brotherly, and though he did
not feel that satisfaction in him that he had hoped for, he
could not easily condemn him; and so, Col. Sutherland swore
they had played into each other's hands; the "mealy-mouthed 
rector" was the partner of the swindling knave;
they were both liars and villains at heart; they had disgraced 
the name of gentleman, and outraged all the laws of
honor and religion, and though the surplice shielded the
one, and the name of Sutherland the other, from the open
obloquy they merited, neither should cross his threshold
again, or share his hospitality or forgiveness; implacable,

<!-- page 113 -->

deadly hatred, while life lasted, between him and his
father's sons.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though he never acknowledged it, time did in
a measure wear these resolutions out. For many years,
while there was work to do, in retrieving what had been
lost, in bending his whole life to the repairing and restoration 
of his fortune, he had nursed his hatred, and had found
it gave him strength to work; but when all was done,
when by long years of retrenchment and industry he had
brought his estate into value once more, and found himself
a richer man than any of his name had been for many
generations&mdash;when he sat down in his great, lonely, cheerless 
house, where no child's laugh ever echoed and no
woman's smile ever shone, perhaps he found his revenge
had hurt himself more than it had hurt any other. He had
much time for thought, many lonesome hours in which to
ponder over his past; indeed, he had not much other food
for thought, and though the heathen plan on which he had
begun his life, had not brought him much inward peace or
satisfaction, he was not prepared to give it up.</p>

<p>The letter of his resolution he still must hold to; he
never would see his brother, never would forgive him; but
he heard with a jealous ear all that concerned the two
children who made the humble rector's home a happier one
than his, and stepped down from his grim pedestal to
receive them, and would fain have won their affection if he
could. But the children were much fonder of their own
home than of his, and their father was too honest and
simple-minded to oblige them to deny it. The gloomy old
man, though, never forgot the change that visit made in

<!-- page 114 -->

his dreary home, and night and day plotted to gain them
back without a compromise of his heathenism. Years
passed on, and he seemed no nearer the attainment of his
wishes than he had been at first, when the news of his
brother's death suddenly cleared the way for him. Greedy
yet crafty, he resolved to wait till they should have gone
through the bitterness of their mourning, till they should
have been perplexed which way to turn in providing for
themselves, till they should have given up all hope of help
from him, and then, he would step in, and offer them a
home and full provision for the future. He gloated over
his plan, gave his long unoccupied days and sleepless nights
to the preparing and perfecting it, and just when it was
ripe, the news came, that hopeless of any other home, they
had accepted the hospitality of their uncle Ralph, and had
sailed two days before for America. The blow proved too
much for his weakened faculties; a levelling stroke of
paralysis resulted, which was soon followed by his death.</p>

<p>And Ralph Sutherland, since he read the news of his
brother's death in that thick, August twilight, by the
white birch on the Catskill, hankered greedily after those
rich acres and overflowing coffers. Though he had always
professed a scorn for the land he had left, and a love for
the land of his adoption, in his secret heart, the old family-place, 
the old home where long ago he had lived innocent
and unremorseful, were better to him than all the promise
of the West. He did not love his new home, rich and
productive as it was; it was bought with the first wages
of his dishonest life, and even to his seared taste, that
recollection gave it a bitter flavor. He hated with the

<!-- page 115 -->

whole force of his nature the brother who had so humbled
and insulted him; and the sweet hope of gratifying at
once his avarice and his rancor, seemed suddenly to have
given new life to his prematurely decaying faculties. To
secure Laura for Lawrence, and to bind the young clergyman 
firmly to his duties here, were his present strongest
purposes; and some very darling hopes seemed to hang
upon his success in their accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Laura Sutherland</span>, though as well disciplined
and properly disposed a young lady as even those days of
discipline and propriety often produced, still cherished
covertly a good deal of the romance to which her age and
sex are ever prone. The darkness in which those old-time
hearts were kept, indeed, could not but be favorable to
romance, not half so blasting to it as the shadowless, broad
noontide of maiden meditation now-a-days. Pull down the
bars, let in the sunshine, and the haunting phantoms of
fancy are gone; shadows and dimness and dreaminess are
their surest strength and safety. And little else they
need, as Laura's case exemplified, for one good honest
flood of daylight would have shown her the unsubstantial
nature of the tenant "her heart's most secret cell" had
harbored for a year, a tenant who had taken possession
solely on the strength of a most melting pair of black eyes,

<!-- page 117 -->

a dazzling uniform, and an ardent admiration for herself.
An admiration of course smothered under the most chivalrous 
and reverential <i>politesse</i>, according to the manner of
the day, and the manner of the young lady who was the
object of the well-bred passion, but which suggestive
system, nevertheless, set her heart beating quite as fest,
and filled her head quite as full of "foolish notions" as the
most free and easy fashion of the present could have done.
Inasmuch as it left more room for imagination, and less
space for common sense, it may be said to be the more
effective system of the two; and perhaps our grandfathers,
in their stilted love-making and finger-tip devotion,
showed more knowledge of the female heart than we have
given them credit for. At all events, they were successful
lovers, or they would not have been our grandfathers; and
though we have spun so far ahead of them, it is barely
possible, if we could snatch the leisure, a little retrospection
might mellow and enrich our shiny, brand-new wisdom, by
comparison, if in no other way.</p>

<p>This Captain Lacy, who had been so successful in making
himself remembered by the pretty Laura, had had but very
short grace to suggest his admiration and secure her
favor. Two or three never-to-be-forgotten days while his
regiment was encamped near Borringdon, two sets at the
county ball, an hour at the next day's archery meeting, a
moment's glance, bending from his saddle, as the Park
carriage passed him, on parade, were the only, but the
golden opportunities he had found for making himself
master of the sweetest, coyest little heart that ever beat,
and giving it food for long hours of dreaming and hoping

<!-- page 118 -->

and fearing, and occasion for frightened starts and guilty
flushes whenever any careless lip or prying eye questioned
of or intruded into its sacred, foolish secret. This fancied
trial, standing in the background of the real ones, of
course, just then, had yet made doubly hopeless the adieu
to home: for the graves of these "darlings of blind fancy
dead and gone," though they are soon overgrown and
neglected, and very willingly forgotten, have many bitter
tears shed over them at first, and are not at all cheerfuller 
of contemplation because they are unwise and
inexcusable.</p>

<p>What precise portion of the habitable globe Captain
Lacy had made glorious with his presence since the period
of the encampment of the 47th at Borringdon, Laura had
had no accurate means of informing herself, for being too
timid and too conscious to suggest the question to any one
who could have enlightened her, she was obliged to grope
blindly about the papers for any intelligence she could glean
in respect to that gallant company. But newspapers were
unsatisfactory things as regarded personalities, she found;
compounders of them seemed to have such widely different
views from herself of what were subjects of interest and
importance, and only a very occasional paragraph now and
then, choked up in weary columns of politics and markets,
gave her any clue to the whereabouts of the only detachment 
of his majesty's army in whose whereabouts she felt
any interest. A month or two before she left England,
however, she had lost track of it entirely: she had probably 
missed the paragraph that recorded its transfer to
some foreign station, and now it might be months again

<!-- page 119 -->

before there was any news of it. Poor Laura was quite
sure there was never any girl so unhappy before, and
looked pale and pretty as she bent over her embroidery,
dreaming idly, and living over and over again the few gay
scenes of romance that had opened upon her quiet life.</p>

<p>"A thousand little shafts of flame," indeed, "were
shivered in her narrow frame," when, one rainy evening,
the candles being lighted early, and the family early
assembled round them, Lawrence, reading the "Gazette,"
stumbled upon some war news that seemed to strike him
as of sufficient interest to read aloud, and which proved of
sufficient interest to make Laura turn red and white, and
tremble and drop her work, and make herself generally
noticeable. The 47th, it appeared, were at present assisting 
at the siege of Quebec; last month had distinguished
themselves in a skirmish with the Indians, which had
resulted in great destruction to their barbarous foes, and
was only to be regretted inasmuch as several men and two
or three valuable officers had been seriously wounded in
the engagement.</p>

<p>Warren looked interested, made some comment, but
after a moment resumed his book. Mrs. Sutherland looked
distressed at the mention of bloodshed and suffering,
thought a moment "how must their poor mothers feel,"
and went on with her knitting. Very inadvertently, Lawrence's 
eye fell on Laura's agitated, guilty face, flushing
and paling as he had never seen it flush and pale before,
and her breath coming quick and short through her parted
lips. A long, steady glance he fixed upon her, and lifting
her eyes suddenly, she caught it, and from that instant the

<!-- page 120 -->

crimson was victorious, and flung its banner over all her
fair white skin. She had betrayed her secret, and betrayed
it to the last one from whom to look for generosity or
mercy. Oh, if it were only back again safe in her own
keeping, deep down in her miserable, cowardly heart! It
looked like such a strange and dreadful thing now that it
was dragged out into the light, and gazed at by other eyes,
and made a reality of, and handled as a fact. It had
seemed harmless enough when it was shut tight in by fear,
and pride, and shame: it was unmaidenly, sinful, humbling,
when it saw the light.</p>

<p>The ball of worsted over which she was bending slipped
from her fingers and rolled across the floor. Lawrence got
up coolly and followed it to the corner where it had stayed
its flight, picked it up, and winding it slowly, came back
to where she sat. It was deliberately cruel, for she had
nothing to do but sit submissive and condemned before
him while he looked steadily at her and wound that dreadful 
worsted. She could not raise her eyes, nor say "thank
you," as he held it out to her, and the hand she extended
for it shook so that it nearly fell again.</p>

<p>Oh, the misery of that long evening! But whether the
tears that fell when she reached her room owed their
origin to vexation, or sorrow, or shame, or joy, or all,
Laura could not have decided for her life.</p>

<p>It was a soft, warm September afternoon; the air outside 
was rich with the mellow ripeness of an autumn atmosphere, 
but within the stone house there was a feeling of
chilliness and dampness that had not got out since the early
morning, and Laura, who had bent perseveringly over her

<!-- page 121 -->

embroidery for three conscientious hours since dinner,
gazed longingly out of the window. All the morning she
had spent over her books, as Warren had recommended,
and now she looked unelastic and languid enough to have
frightened that strict young disciplinarian out of his rules
forever, if he had been by to see. But he was not; no
one, in fact, was, and with a weary sigh she leaned back in
her chair, and pushed the hair away from her forehead.
What good was all that work, "red with the blood of
murdered time," ever to do her, she wondered. What use
was there, either, in the dull dry books she tried to be
patient over so long every sunshiny morning&mdash;books out
of which she did not get a single thought, or the suggestion
of a thought that gave her pleasure&mdash;dull, stale, chaffy
records of dull, stale facts? They might be good as discipline, 
but for some cause she fretted against discipline
to-day. She pined to feel like Nattee, and be at home in
the fields and woods; she was thirsty for the sunshine and
the freedom of the air outside these walls. What if there
were another hour's sand to creep through the slow hourglass 
above her on the shelf before her task would be
completed! It might take its own time in going through,
she should look at it no longer; and starting up, she flung
the covering over her tapestry frame, put away her books,
and catching up her long grey cloak, pulled the hood of it
over her head, and went out, passing through the kitchen
on her way.</p>

<p>That apartment, in its scrubbed, sunshiny afternoon
phase, was tenanted only by Salome and her Indian handmaid,

<!-- page 122 -->

and Laura, seeing the advanced state of the day's
work, ventured to say:</p>

<p>"Salome, can't you spare Nattee to go into the woods
with me a little while?"</p>

<p>But Salome, somewhat jealous of the favor lavished by
the young lady on her rather flighty assistant, shook her
head, and said she was sorry to misoblige Miss Laura, but
Nattee was getting more shiftless every day; she hadn't
done work enough since breakfast to pay for her keep, and
she couldn't, with any conscience, think of letting her go
away till the afternoon chores were all done up, and they
were hardly begun as yet.</p>

<p>Nattee, bending over a milk-pan, and scrubbing it with
all her might, did not look up while Laura was in the
kitchen, but dropping it hastily, she followed her to the
gate, ready to cry with disappointment, but keeping up a
brave behavior. She pointed out the road into the woods
that Laura was to take, and leaned over the gate, watching
her till the winding of the lane shut the grey cloak from
her envious eyes.</p>

<p>The grass felt warm and pleasant to Laura's slender
feet, numb with their long day's inaction, and the autumn
sunshine was so bright, yet so undazzling, that every chilled
pulse seemed to warm into new life. The sky overhead
was purely blue, not the ghost of a cloud from horizon to
zenith; the wind was still; the woods were tinged with the
first touch of autumn, and yet green with the lingering summer; 
the Flats, shorn of their recent wealth, or stacked with
their year's produce, looked peaceful and harvest-like as
they lay smooth beneath the slanting rays of the afternoon

<!-- page 123 -->

sun; the air, balmy as early summer, was just that shade
and tone more perfect than early summer, that the
woman's beauty is softer and more alluring than the girl's,
richer and riper, and fuller of repose, mellow with the
experience of a thoughtful past, quiet with the consciousness 
of a coming strength. This suggestion of bracing,
invigorating days to come, that steals through September's
softest breezes, stole through even the noiseless wind of that
perfect September day, and whispered of new hope with
every breath, to the young exile from the softer but duskier
skies of England.</p>

<p>What a day for the woods! She grudged the long hours
she had wasted in the house, as she found her way along
the rocky road Nattee had indicated to her. This was the
first time she had been so far from the house alone, but
there was nothing, she assured herself, to fear. The men
talked of this piece of woodland as the "Five-mile Woods,"
and the suggestion of their extent had rather disinclined
her to frequent them hitherto; but Nattee's directions had
been so explicit, she had no fear of being lost, at least
while daylight lasted.</p>

<p>She had not pursued the path into the forest very far
before, looking down below her, over the ledge of rock
beside the path, she saw a solitary log cabin, standing by
the edge of the wood. Such a snug, cosy little home it
seemed to be, nestled down at the foot of the woody hill,
with a little patch of garden beside it, and the great pine-trees 
leaning over it. And a child's pleasant voice, singing
a familiar song, attracted her still further. Ah! the child
just matched the voice&mdash;a little girl about eight years old,

<!-- page 124 -->

tanned and healthy looking, with brown hair cropped short
all round her head, and a long, blue frock coming down to
the tops of her heavy shoes. She had great, brown, honest
eyes, and a serious, unchild-like mouth, and withal there
was a straightforward simplicity about her face, and a
matter-of-fact regularity about her motions that made her
as prepossessing as she was odd.</p>

<p>"She's a darling little English child, I know," thought
Laura. "Who can live in that house? I've half a mind
to go down and see."</p>

<p>She watched some time longer, while the little girl,
standing in the sunshine at the side of the house, cleaned
her knives on a low bench, and sung her cheerful, simple
song. No one else appearing while she watched, the young
lady at length proceeded to descend the rocks, at considerable 
disadvantage, owing to the burden of hoop and cloak
she carried, and her entire unfamiliarity with rocks; but at
last she reached the mossy ground below, and gathering
her cloak about her, approached the child, who, surprised,
laid down her work and dropped a courtesy.</p>

<p>"Your little house looked so pleasant, I concluded
to come down and see it," she said, with her pretty
smile.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in," said the little girl, leading the
way.</p>

<p>Laura followed, saying hesitatingly: "Is your mother in
the house?"</p>

<p>"Mother's dead," the child returned, placing a chair for
her.</p>

<p>"Who do you live with, then?" asked Laura, sitting

<!-- page 125 -->

down and glancing around the marvellously tidy, cheery
room.</p>

<p>"Father and I live here together," answered the little
woman, standing straight before her.</p>

<p>"And who does the work, and keeps it all so nice,
pray?"</p>

<p>"I do the work indoors, and father splits the wood and
keeps the garden orderly."</p>

<p>"You! oh, you little marvel! Why, how old are you, I
should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Eight this Michaelmas, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're a little English girl!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. I was a year old when we came from
home."</p>

<p>"How long has your mother been dead?"</p>

<p>"She died on the passage out, and father brought me all
the way here in his arms."</p>

<p>"Have you no relations here? Did nobody ever live
with you, to take care of you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody, ma'am. Father took the care of me always."</p>

<p>"You haven't told me what your father's name is?"</p>

<p>"Mark Eberley, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've seen him at the farm; a strong, tall man,
with eyes like yours. And what's your name, pray?"</p>

<p>"My name's Mary; but father don't ever call me so.
He calls me 'Little Steadfast,' or 'Steady' sometimes, for
short."</p>

<p>"Little Steady! What a funny name. I think I see the
reason, too, you got it. Do <i>you</i> know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, only if it isn't because mother's name

<!-- page 126 -->

was Mary, and he don't like to be saying it round the
house always."</p>

<p>"Ah! Little Steadfast, I shall come and see you sometimes, 
and you shall show me how to bake bread, and
make the milkpans shine, and how to be happy all the
time."</p>

<p>Little Steadfast looked pleased and rather laughed,
though not exactly as if she were in the habit of laughing,
and laid another stick on the bright little fire on the
hearth, over which she had but just swung the kettle.</p>

<p>"You've got the kettle on early, Steady," said her
visitor.</p>

<p>"Yes; but father'll be home in an hour, and he likes his
supper at five o'clock, sharp."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He's with the men from the farm, raising the new barn
over the other side of the woods. It's a long way off, and
I'm afraid he won't be back as early as he is most days."</p>

<p>"Well, Steady, I must go; but I think I'll come very
soon to see you, and bring you a picture-book, if you'd
like it."</p>

<p>It was very evident little Steadfast would like it, and
Laura resumed her walk, with a half-envious look back at
her, as she stood contentedly in the door of the little cabin.</p>

<p>What a day for the woods indeed! The sunlight flickered 
down through the many-colored leaves overhead and
lighted up the dim aisles of the forest with a softened
splendor; here and there a late bird sang; and over the
smooth ledge of rock beside the path, a Virginia creeper,
dyed gorgeous crimson, hung its careless fringes. And,

<!-- page 127 -->

whether following with wondering eyes the towering
height of some majestic tree, or kneeling with almost
childish ecstasy before some strange and lovely bed of
moss, Laura's heart was telling her, this was the life to live,
these were the books to read, this was the embroidery over
which to bend&mdash;this soft, rich, dainty covering that
Nature weaves over rotting trunks of fallen trees, or
around tinkling springs and tiny waterfalls, dripping
through the rocks. This is the solitude that does not chill,
the silence that does not sadden, the idleness that does not
enervate. Thank God, there is one sort of love for earthly
things that does not cramp and dull the heart&mdash;one sort of
love that has no sting, that brings no self-reproach and
shame, that one can remember at one's prayers, and make
the prayers the purer. The beautiful woods, the mountains
painted against the sky, the sea stretched out vast beneath
it&mdash;these we can love and not love God the less&mdash;these, till
He makes a new heaven and a new earth for our eternal
joy, are the safe and holy pleasures that He offers us.</p>

<p>Laura, led on from one delight to another, had wandered
deep into the woods before she remembered it must be
growing late, and she was far from home. There was a
chilly feeling in the air that warned her of the hour, so,
pausing, she pulled her cloak closer round her throat, and
resolved to retrace her steps. It was too sweet a scene to
leave, though! A huge grey rock, crested with moss and
draped with vines, frowned above her head, while from a
crevice at its foot a stream of water fell down into a mossy
bowl, and all around, the rich, woody earth was green with
the dark squaw-vine and bright with its red berry; and

<!-- page 128 -->

green moss, and grey moss, and cup-moss, and slender
ferns, made a marvellous miniature forest around the fairy
spring in the heart of the great forest. The path rather
widened about this spot, and led up the hill quite distinctly
in sight for some distance. Laura did not feel quite so
lonely when she saw footprints along it, and remembered
from Steady's story that the men had gone this way to
their work on the new barn, which must be about half a
mile from where she now was. She need not hurry, it
could not be supper-time, or they would be returning.
She bent over the little forest at her feet, and with a handful 
of squawberries was turning away, when she started
back with a little shriek. A bright-red lizard, some two
inches long, redder and brighter than the berries, lay
looking at her with his bead-like, black specks of eyes,
human and horrible in their significance. It was such a
shock, among the mute, simple children of the forest, to
find such an eye as that; and while she hung fascinated
and terrified above it, a snake wound silently through the
dead leaves at her feet, and disappeared beneath the rock.
She started up, chilled with fear, and dropping her berries,
hurried out into the path.</p>

<p>But, hark! from over the hill, through the still evening
air, at that moment there burst a stunning, deafening
sound, booming through the forest, reverberating from hill
to hill, heavier and more dreadful as it rolled away. And
distant as it had seemed, Laura knew she heard a cry, a
terrible, sharp cry, lost in faint echoes long before the
deafening cannon-like report had died away, but ringing in
her ear with tenfold more appalling horror. What could

<!-- page 129 -->

it mean? What dreadful judgment had fallen to close
this peaceful day? Had some swift thundercloud mounted
the heavens and burst upon the woods? She looked fearfully 
up, but through the leafy arch above her head the
sky was clear and soft, still glowing with the splendor of
the sunken sun; and now, while she listened, all was silent,
silent as death. She could not, dared not go away; every
step she put between her and this spot was so much longer
wearying suspense, and her faint limbs refused to advance
and meet the news, whatever it might be, that must come
from over that doomed hill. She clasped her hands around
a slender birch stem beside the path and tried to calm herself 
and wait, while the stillness grew heavier and the light
above grew paler. Day indeed was dying in the heart of
the still forest; would that her fear were dying, too!</p>

<p>At last! Voices from over the hill, faint and distant,
but gradually approaching, struck her ear, and soon, winding 
down the path, she caught sight of the workmen
coming. But not as workmen come from an honest, hearty
day of labor, with home and supper near, and welcome of
wife and child, and the night's rest before them; sad and
slow, with heavy, lowered voices, they defiled down the
path, and on the shoulders of four &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Ah! It needed
not to have seen that burden before for Laura to know
what was stretched upon the rough litter, and covered with
its hasty pall of coarse white canvas, trailing nearly to the
ground; her horror-struck eye had only to catch the outline 
of the head, the arms crossed on the chest, the droop
of the canvas about the pointed feet.</p>

<p>Lawrence, walking slowly beside the bier, caught sight

<!-- page 130 -->

of her, and starting forward, motioned the men to drop
back, while taking her hand, he led her forward, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Laura. An accident has happened 
to one of the workmen, over the hill, in blasting
rocks for the foundation of the new barn."</p>

<p>"Warren wasn't there?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh no, he went home two hours ago. It is poor
Eberley, Mark Eberley, who lives just at the edge of the
wood here."</p>

<p>"Oh! Not poor little Steady's father!" cried Laura.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Lawrence, with a sigh, "poor little
Steady's father. It's a dreadful thing."</p>

<p>There was a long pause, while Laura and Lawrence
walked silently on and the men followed, slowly, at a little
distance.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" at last Laura asked, through her
tears.</p>

<p>"The rock was drilled and ready an hour ago, and the
match had been lighted, and the men all went across the
lot and waited, but it did not fire the train of powder. It
was growing late, and they were getting impatient to go
home, and at last Mark said he'd go across and see; but
just as he reached the rock and stooped down to look, the
explosion came"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And a shudder finished the story.</p>

<p>"Poor little Steady! And has she no relations?"</p>

<p>"None; she must come home to us. I'd rather anything 
than take her this bad news, poor little woman!
Poor Mark hardly thought this morning, when he went

<!-- page 131 -->

over the hill, we'd be bringing him home dead to his little
daughter at sundown!"</p>

<p>"Was he a good man, Lawrence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, better than any of us, I'm afraid. A good,
honest, strong-hearted man, and tried to do his duty all the
way through. We'll wait a long while before we get
another man at the farm that's half his worth. Poor
Mark! I've never seen reason to doubt he was a Christian
in all the time since he first darkened our door, with his
bundle strapped over his shoulder, and his motherless baby
in his arms, seven years ago this coming Christmas."</p>

<p>At this moment an opening in the trees showed the
ruddy blaze of the firelight through the window of Mark's
cabin, and involuntarily Laura and Lawrence stopped and
looked with painful sympathy in each other's face. Lawrence 
pressed his hand for an instant before his eyes, and
ejaculated: "I cannot tell her, I cannot."</p>

<p>He motioned the men to halt, and walking to the edge
of the rock, leaned against a tree, and looked down at the
quiet little home with an actual groan. "Laura, would
you mind breaking it to the child? It might be better
coming from a woman&mdash;but I ought not to put it on
you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Laura, sadly. "I will go and tell her. No
one can know better how to pity her."</p>

"Thank you," he said, almost inaudibly, and descending
the ledge, he lifted her down after him. Once out of the
woods it was still quite light, though the twilight was
increasing every moment. They followed the little path
worn by Mark's patient feet from the wood-pile at the side,

<!-- page 132 -->

round to the low gate in front of the cabin. Little Steadfast 
was standing in the door, but seeing the young lady
approach and falter, she went down the path to meet her,
and said:</p>

<p>"I was afraid you had got lost. Is anything the matter?"</p>

<p>For Laura's face was white, and her hands so trembling
she could hardly raise the latchet of the gate; Steady
helped her, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, how cold you are! Come into the house, won't
you? I've got a nice fire for father." And she glanced
around toward the woods behind the house to see if he
were yet in sight.</p>

Laura felt a pang when she saw the glance and remembered 
the burden on the shoulders of the four men just
within the wood. There was a bench at the foot of the
pine tree by the gate, where Mark smoked his pipe on
summer evenings; sinking down on it, Laura drew the
child close to her, and in a choking tone, said:</p>

<p>"Steady, I know you say your prayers. Let me hear
you say 'Our Father.' "</p>

<p>The little girl, simply enough, knelt down by Laura's
lap, and putting her hands together, with a reverent face
and voice, repeated the Lord's Prayer. Laura put her
arms around her, and kept her kneeling when she had
ended it, and stooping over her, whispered:</p>

<p>"I used to say that when I was a little girl; my dear
father used to hear me say it every night; but he's dead
now, and I have to say it by myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry for you," said the child, lifting her
serious face.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>"But, Steady," and Laura's voice shook; "I love that
prayer, because, though it reminds me my father is gone
out of the world, it tells me that the dear Lord is my
Father, and loves me and will take care of me. And he
will take care of my father that is dead, too, and will bring
me into Heaven to meet him at the last, if I am good.
Steady, I think so much about that time! It's the time
all Christians will be happy."</p>

<p>"I know," said Steady. "It's the Resurrection. Father
told me all about it only Sunday night, and about mother,
who was waiting these seven years for us in Paradise."</p>

<p>"Should you be very unhappy, my little girl, if God
called you to go to your mother, and be at rest in that
holy place?"</p>

<p>"Without father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, without him."</p>

<p>"I don't know; I shouldn't like to be without him, but
then he says it's a great deal better there."</p>

<p>"Oh I am sure he thought it was a great deal better
there. And if you heard, Steady, that he had gone there
to be with your dear mother and wait for you, I am sure
you would not murmur."</p>

<p>"But I don't want him to go," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"But if it were God's will, my darling"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I wish he'd come home;" and she
glanced uneasily toward the wood.</p>

<p>"My darling, he never will come home," cried Laura,
folding her arms about the little girl, and bursting into
tears. "He is in that better home he told you of, with the
saints and angels and your dear mother. I don't know

<!-- page 134 -->

how to comfort you&mdash;I know your little heart is breaking&mdash;but 
God will comfort you, my darling&mdash;God knows how
hard it is, and He is very sorry for you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;tell me how&mdash;he"&mdash;stammered the stunned
child, before the great sob rising in her throat stopped her
utterance.</p>

<p>"They have been blasting rocks over the hill"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The child's low groan showed she knew the worst at
once.</p>

<p>"If you will come home with me, I will tell you all
to-night. Mr. Lawrence knows&mdash;he will tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, my little girl," he said, approaching her and
stooping down to kiss her. "I will tell you all. Oh,
Steady, it makes me almost as unhappy as it does you.
But I must not talk about it now; you must come over to
the farm with me."</p>

<p>Laura felt the shudder that went through the child's
frame, as lifting her head, and turning to Lawrence, she
said huskily:</p>

<p>"Let me see him, won't you?"</p>

<p>"No, not now. Steady. It isn't best just now. I want
you to come with us."</p>

<p>After a moment's pause, she said, "I must cover up the
fire, and take the kettle off first."</p>

<p>And walking with a slow, heavy step up the path, she
went into the house and closed the door. Laura leaned
her face down against the trunk of the pine, and Lawrence
walked restlessly up and down the path, watching gloomily
the slow darkening of the little window, while the light
flickered up fainter and fainter, and then died altogether,

<!-- page 135 -->

as the unsteady hand of the child heaped the lately blazing
fire with ashes.</p>

<p>Ah! the light of that happy little home had gone out
forever; no wonder that many long minutes passed before
poor little Steady, with her cloak and hood tied on, came
out again. Laura could imagine well the pang that every
care had cost the thoughtful child, taking off the steaming,
singing kettle, putting away the unused plate and cup,
extinguishing the cheery sparkle of the fire, leaving to
cold, dark solitude the home she had never in her life left
for a night before; and no child could be so precociously
painstaking and sober as Steady, without an accompanying
development of intellect and heart. Whatever burst of
grief, however, that sad parting with her home had
occasioned, it had all subsided when she came out again,
and latching carefully the door, went down the path.
Laura took her hand in hers, and drawing her partly under
her cloak, led her out of the gate as Lawrence held it open.
He signed to the men in the wood to come down, and
then walked on beside Laura and the little orphan, on
their slow, sad walk toward what must now be home to
both.</p>

<p>Changings and partings and sorrows are the rule this
side heaven, Laura thought, and perhaps, after all, it was
best little Steady's trial should have come before the fully
matured heart and intellect had grown up to their perfect
capacity of suffering. For the future, the poor little girl
had as yet no fears. She did not look further ahead than
we are told to look, and for which distance we have
strength promised us, but for no more. She was a child

<!-- page 136 -->

in faith as well as a child in years, and so a child in suffering, 
and her great sorrow came to her mercifully divided
and lightened, as our sorrows would come to us, perhaps,
if we would but take them as we are told to take them.</p>

<p>What mortal strength can be sufficient for the weight of
the great chain of discipline that goes through every life,
and binds it to the eternal shore beyond the waves of this
troublesome world? No mortal strength can; its accumulated 
weight, only for an instant, would sink the stoutest
struggler; but, link by link, not looking impatiently
beyond, but looking patiently down, humbly and faithfully
accepting it as the only means of safety, hard and rough
and heavy as it may be, it can be borne, and it will bring
us surely to the haven where we would be. But, greedy
of our sorrow as of our pleasure, vehement and unreasonable, 
we drag a weight upon ourselves we have no warrant
to suppose we shall have power to bear, and struggling,
half crushed, beneath the selfishly and morbidly retained
burden of yesterday, and the dreaded but yet unbestowed
calamity of to-morrow, we question, in our intolerable
distress, if God has not broken His promise that we shall
not be tempted above what we are able to bear. No,
verily; but we have broken faith with Him. We have not
believed that one day's evil was sufficient for it, but have
pulled down upon it the evil of many; and so, very likely,
our punishment is greater than we can bear.</p>

<p>Laura, bending over the newly orphaned child's even
sleep that night, thought sorrowfully of her own want of
faith, when she was orphaned and exiled from home. How
much unnecessary foreboding, indeed, she had burdened

<!-- page 137 -->

herself with; how many miseries she had anticipated that
had never come; how much she would have spared herself
if she had, like little Steady, only taken up the loneliness
and bereavement of the moment, and lain down to sleep,
not knowing but that the night might end it, and the
morning might find her trouble ended or her strength
increased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new barn over the hill went on to its completion
with rapid strides, but a wonderful change in its destination
had transpired. It was but a rough building, constructed
of unhewn logs, and floored with the flat stone that was
more plentiful even than logs in that mountain neighborhood; 
but rough as it was, it would never have slipped
from Ralph Sutherland's grasping fingers, if his crafty
brain had not dictated the sacrifice from avaricious
motives. Warren, he had found, could no longer be
contented with his present life of inaction; either he must
consent to the formal beginning of a ministry he hated, in
his neighborhood, or lose the links he now held between
him and his brother's wealth, and it was not long before
his resolution, gruff and against the grain as it had gone,
was made known to Warren. If nothing but preaching
the gospel would suit him, he shouldn't complain he had

<!-- page 139 -->

denied him a place to preach it in; he was welcome to the
new barn, if it would serve his turn, and being out of
earshot of the farm, he might preach as loud as Brother
Pertinax himself, as long as he didn't do any private
preaching in his hearing. The crops had not been as heavy
as they had anticipated this year, and the barn wasn't really
wanted, and if Lawrence chose to hurry up the men, it
might be ready before cold weather.</p>

<p>Lawrence had taken hold of the project with much zest;
Laura could think of nothing else. Mrs. Sutherland hardly
dared believe her hopes were so near their consummation,
and held her breath for fear they should be crushed at last,
while a new light dawned in the young minister's eye, and
a new hope filled his heart. October had but just begun,
and Lawrence promised Warren might read the service for
All Saints' Day in the new chapel. This chapel had given a
marvellously invigorated tone to the quiet life at the farmhouse; 
it was something to work for, to date from, to consult 
over. Not one member of the household, from Steady
up, save the grim head of it, but felt the inspiring influence
of the good work in hand, and the cheering and drawing
together that united good work always effects.</p>

<p>It was a sharp, cold October evening, and Ralph, shuffling 
off to bed some half hour earlier than his usual early
period of retirement, left the family group in an unrestrained 
and easy state of comfort. A great fire was roaring 
up the chimney, taking much heat and many sparks
with it, but throwing out into the room enough warmth for
the season, and a great glow of light. The heavy, low-browed 
room was cheerfuller than it had been for many a

<!-- page 140 -->

long year, and the people in it, too, were cheerfuller than
they ever hoped to be, some of them. Mrs. Sutherland's
wheel, at one end of the room, spun its quiet soothing song,
while Nattee knelt beside her earnestly assisting her.
Laura, at one side of the fireplace, was bending over her
embroidery-frame, lighted at her work by a lamp above her
on the shelf. A use had been found for the beautiful crimson 
vanity, and now she never shook the hourglass when
she worked, and sometimes forgot to look at it. It was to
cover the board of the reading-desk, the foot of which Lawrence 
was carving at that moment, seated on the opposite
side of the fire, with his arms on his knees, and stooping
down to get the benefit of its light, till the troublesome
curls tumbled about his eyes and the blaze deepened the
color of his bronzed cheeks to a dark red.</p>

<p>"I think you'd be puzzled, Warren," he cried at last,
tossing the curls back, and lifting up his work, "to decide
what school of architecture that belongs to. It looks like
nothing, in nature or art, that I'm familiar with!"</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that," said Warren, with a little
laugh, looking up from the shaded lamp by which he was
reading in the other corner of the room. "It's a little
irregular as to model, I confess; but really, original as the
plan is, I think it's quite a success. At any rate, it will do
vastly well till the Venerable Society vote us a replenishment 
of chancel furniture, and the organ Laura has set her
heart upon."</p>

<p>It was so pleasant to hear Warren laugh again, that
Laura echoed it very quickly, and Lawrence said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we shall be a venerable society on our own

<!-- page 141 -->

account before that devoutly-to-be-wished consummation
crowns our waiting."</p>

<p>"That is very possible," Warren said; and Lawrence,
stooping over his work again, finished the sentence for
him:</p>

<p>"And by no means undesirable. I wouldn't give a rush
for a chapel I had to thank a missionary society three thousand 
miles away for. We're not heathen; let them send
their charity where it is needed. If we can't swim on our
own account, the sooner we sink the better, I say."</p>

<p>"I think you'll find the 'own-account' principle an
unprofitable one in the matter of church, my good fellow,"
said Warren, resuming his book. "I know nowhere that it
is more out of place; that is, if the 'communion of saints'
means anything."</p>

<p>"I never understood it to mean anything but a vague
spiritual bond, that nobody thought much about or was
much influenced by," returned Lawrence, doggedly, heretical 
principally for Laura's provocation. The young clergyman 
possibly divined the motive, and dismissed the budding
argument with&mdash;</p>

<p>"I commend that article of the faith to your study,
then."</p>

<p>"Steady," said Laura, reprovingly, to that little girl, who,
sitting on a bench on the floor, at the confines of the young
lady's dress, was thumbing inattentively her primer, and
gazing about her idly. "You will never learn to read, if
you don't pay more attention. It's an hour since I gave
you that lesson, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, Steady," cried Lawrence, "you'll never grow up

<!-- page 142 -->

to be a well-behaved young woman, if you don't learn to
keep your eyes under cover of your eyelashes, and never to
look up from your work, under any circumstances, and to
count your stitches straight ahead, no matter what's going
on, and never by any chance to say anything to anybody."</p>

<p>Steady looked very much bewildered and very uncomfortable, 
and bent her eyes on her book penitently; while
Laura, stooping over her shoulder, pointed out the lesson to
her afresh, and rewarded the young Lawless' careless disrespect 
with the silence it deserved.</p>

<p>Now, a girl who can't be teased, and who won't retort&mdash;who 
will, in fact, do nothing but look infinitely pretty and
grow very distant&mdash;is an extremely uncomfortable person
to deal with. Lawrence was unspeakably angry with his
cousin a dozen times a day, and vowed he'd never look at
her again, or lose his temper about anything so cold and
spiritless; but a dozen times a day he saw something to
make him doubt if she were cold to any one but him, or
spiritless except upon principle and with design. Amiability 
and simplicity alone, he knew, could not make a perfect 
woman; there must be spirit kept down by amiability,
and intellect feminized by simplicity of character, to make a
perfect woman, whose sweetness will not pall, whose companionship 
will not weary, and whose beauty will not fade.
And every day he watched her added to the conviction he
rebelled against, that his cousin was maturing into such a
woman. There was nothing of the doll about her, with all
her prettiness; there was a dignity in her movements that
came from something deeper than natural grace of manner,
a gentleness and yielding that did not argue weakness, a

<!-- page 143 -->

coldness and reserve that were not born of heartlessness
or narrowness of soul. Lawrence would have tired of her
in a week as he had tired successively of all the blooming
inanities of the neighborhood, if she had been the half-childish 
little coward he had tried to think her; but sorely
against his will, he began to find he could not tire of her&mdash;she 
never gave him a chance; she froze him with her coldness, 
and maddened him with her loveliness, and stole daily
further from his grasp.</p>

<p>And at last, when he found what stood in the way of his
success, when he discovered that there was not only a rival,
but a favored rival, between him and the woman that he
coveted, there had been a struggle of pride to renounce
her, but not a victory. No; like the determined, self-willed, 
self-reliant fellow he had always been, he resolved to
win her, though an army of rivals filled the path; he would
hardly have chosen them to stand there, but he never was
cowardly enough to wish them away: he comprehended his
difficulties at a glance, but they never damped his courage.
Laura should be his, clodhopperism, cousinship, coldness, notwithstanding; 
she should be made to love him even against
her will. He was not afraid of her; one dash of fear or
hesitation would have ruined all; but the night in the
orchard had melted the only unsound tenet in his admiration. 
He never could have been her lover if he had
retained it; she was but a woman: while he was in the
flesh, he was not capable of loving an angel. The only sort
of worship that was consistent with his thorough manliness
he gave her; he reverenced her for the purity and goodness 
that made her better than other women, and he loved

<!-- page 144 -->

her passionately for the follies that showed she was yet but
a woman. The refinement, the cultivation, the delicacy
that at first had seemed to place such a gulf between them
he had spanned; his strength, his self-reliance, placed him
far beyond it: she was a perfect woman, but his heart told
him the perfect woman finds her master in the thorough
man.</p>

<p>So while Warren Sutherland was trying to wear his
passion out by penance and by prayer, and cure himself of
his hopeless love by all the arguments his religion and his
reason could afford, his braver cousin was going to work
in a very different way, and was showing in his plan the
superior wisdom that is vouchsafed to the children of this
world.</p>

<p>And, while his tone was careless and his manner cold,
there was an occasional gleam in his eye that Laura could
not understand. To-night, as she bent her head again
over her work and stole a glance at him from under her
eyelashes, his eyes had just rested on her as she looked up.
"I will possess her or will die," they said, while his
mouth, half sneering, half smiling, wholly indifferent,
belied their passionate protestation, and roused and fascinated 
her curiosity by the strange inconsistency they
showed. But she would have been more puzzled and less
pleased if she had seen the triumphant laugh that lighted
them, as, a moment after, she bit her lip, and with a slight
impatience began to pull out the stitches that had gone
wrong while she had been wondering. One cannot think
of two things at a time, if one is a perfect woman.</p>

<P>"Nattee," cried Lawrence, "shut the kitchen door.

<!-- page 145 -->

Those noisy rascals out there disturb Miss Laura. She
cannot think about her work."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Laura, very distantly, "but you need
not shut the door for me. I like to hear them laugh. I
have not thought of being disturbed."</p>

<p>"No? Well then, Nattee, you may leave it. Halloa,
you Amen, what's the joke? Come here, you rascal, and
tell us."</p>

<p>A smothered burst of merriment from the kitchen had
preceded this, and at his master's summons Amen came
over to the door from the hearth where he had been
presiding, and peeped around the corner of the door with
much affectation of humility and embarrassment, but with
much real cunning in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" said Lawrence, laughing as he
looked at him.</p>

<p>"Where's massa?" he whispered, glancing in.</p>

<p>"Gone to bed this half hour. Come, nobody'll scold
you. What deviltry have you been about since supper?"</p>

<p>"Deviltry? Oh, Mass' Larry," cried the young imp,
deprecatingly, "I've been runnin' of arrants ever since
dark. I've only jes' come in from Martin's."</p>

<p>At this there was another chuckle from the kitchen,
while Lawrence said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you're so long about telling your story, I'll send you
off to bed."</p>

<p>At which threat Amen recovered himself enough to
begin.</p>

<p>It appeared that immediately after supper, Salome,
finding herself out of yeast, had dispatched Amen to get

<!-- page 146 -->

some from a neighbor's, and that, contrary to all precedent,
Amen had gone straight to the place to which he had been
sent. Perhaps the little circumstance of the place being
the village tavern, may have had something to do with
this unusual obedience, as it certainly did explain the
fact of his being very tardy in coming away from it.
The chilliness of the night had influenced similarly some
dozen neighboring worthies, young and old, and the bar-room 
was so filled with their solemn and unceasing smoke,
that Amen's eyes blinked and smarted for some minutes
after he had stowed himself comfortably away under the
table, lying on his stomach, with his feet on the pile of
wood in the corner, and his woolly head next the fire.
He laughed silently as the men told their slow jokes, and
replenished their long pipes; and engrossed by the
festivity of the scene, never cast a look on the empty
kettle beside him, nor a thought on the empty bread-trough 
waiting at home. The being where he had no
business to be, was pleasure enough in itself to Amen, and
when to this inspiring circumstance was added the comfort
of having his head within two feet of the fire, at a temperature 
of 92&deg; Fahrenheit, and of inhaling the delicious
fumes of the mugs of ale above him on the table, it
is not strange that he forgot his "arrant," and gave
himself up to the temptations of the hour.</p>

<p>He was of an appreciative and quick intellect, rather,
it must be owned, in advance of the rest of the
company in point of speed of thought, and while mine
host lumbered heavily through some of his heaviest stories,
or Caspar van Hausen "norrated" pompously, between

<!-- page 147 -->

puffs of smoke and sips of ale, Amen flew to the end of
the story and back, before either had got half way
through, and valued himself much on the feat he was
capable of performing. The position he occupied
demanded a silence very contrary to his taste, and when
the conversation straggled into the channel into which it
almost invariably straggled at the inn, it became such a
self-denial to him to hold his tongue, that it almost
destroyed his pleasure. No one had reason to feel more
strongly than he felt on the subject in hand, and it was
doubly cruel to him to hear them thumb it over with so
little force. The manifold atrocities and impositions of
the people of the adjacent States, their iniquities and
extortions, their bare-faced cheating and their smooth-faced 
lying, roused the honest Dutchmen into a sombre
strain of eloquence.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," said Martin, mine host, sucking at his pipe,
and helping his robust right leg over his robust left. "It's
risky pusiness, lettin' 'em get a vootin' on the Vlatts.
The only ting's to geep 'em off, to durn our backs on 'em,
and let 'em take der truck home again."</p>

<p>And Martin's broad back, as Amen saw it, did look like
a discouraging thing to have turned on one. There was a
grumpy chorus of assent to the suggested suppression of
the nutmeg trade, and waxing valiant with the comfortable 
security of closed doors and distant foes, a solemn
league and covenant was entered into by the assembled 
Hollanders, never again in any way to encourage
or abet, trade with or protect, any Yankee, live or dead,
of either friendly or hostile professions or designs. They

<!-- page 148 -->

bolstered up, with much eloquence, their traditional faith
in the power of their High Mightinesses, the States-General; 
in short, having nobody to oppose them, they
talked themselves into the belief that they were an invincible 
and progressive nation, and that their opponents and
rivals on the soil were far too feeble and insignificant a
race to cause them much discomfort.</p>

<p>"Dey're too mean to live," said Caspar, taking his pipe
out of his mouth to say it, "and de best ting dey can do's
te die."</p>

<p>"Trust 'em for that," cried a young man of wider views.
"They won't die, they're tough as leather. You never
hear of one dying."</p>

<p>"What becomes of 'em?" asked another.</p>

<p>Caspar shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know," cried Amen, from under the table. "They
salt each other away for pork every year or two&mdash;the old
'uns that can't work. Massa never buys pork of 'em, he's
too sharp."</p>

<p>Martin moved uneasily on his bench at this suggestion,
for he had made his supper off a sinewy ham he had been
forced to take as compensation for the lodging of the last
Yankee who had tabernacled among them, and passed his
hand thoughtfully over the vast doublet beneath which it
was sepulchred.</p>

<p>"I trow not&mdash;I trow not," he murmured; "it was lean,
but it wasn't lean enough for that&mdash;not half lean enough
for that."</p>

<p>Then giving a scowl at Amen, who, turtle like, drew in
his black head at the sign, he got up, with the effort that it

<!-- page 149 -->

costs a man encumbered with three hundred pounds of mortal 
coil to get up, and took a turn or two about the room,
taking the beer-barrel in his way, and trying to allay the
suspicion within by a long draught at it. "It's only vun of
old Ralph's lies to keep the men vrom eating their vill," he
thought, trying to reassure himself, as he took another
swig; that was all very well, but it was a notorious fact,
that ham had made Gretchen and the boys sick both times
they had eaten of it, and, beer notwithstanding, had never
set well in his own case. Old Martin's stomach was of a
loyal and steady-going character, little given to rebellion,
without the least tendency to squeamishness, and but for
that unhappy and uncalled-for allusion of Amen's, would
have submitted to a far worse and tougher ham than the
one off which he had supped. He joined no further in the
talking, but the sanded floor of the room bore tracks of his
great feet as he crossed it uneasily ten or a dozen times,
then murmuring indistinctly, it was "treatful hot," he made
rather abruptly for the door.</p>

<p>After the lapse of several minutes, he returned somewhat
hurriedly, looking a little pale about the gills, and wearing
an expression of considerable alarm. "Dere's von of 'em,"
he said in a shaky voice, closing the door hastily after him;
"dere's von of 'em outside. Vatt&mdash;vatt's pest to pe dun.
eh?"</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell on the company; the Dutch intellect
is an unwieldly intellect, not so good on occasions of emergency 
as on many other occasions; no one seemed ready
with any advice, and time passed.</p>

<p>"Vatt's pest to pe dun?" murmured Martin again, fumbling 

<!-- page 150 -->

with the handle of the door. The men looked from
one to another, and did not say what was best to be done;
did not even look as if they had a definite idea on any subject.</p>

<p>Amen rolled out from under the table and whispered,
"Bolt him out&mdash;bolt him out"&mdash;and then rolled back
again. And Martin mechanically obeyed the suggestion;
it is so natural, in a moment of uncertainty, to do what anybody 
tells you briskly to do, even if he is an Amen. But
he did not quite succeed in obeying the little African's
direction, for the stranger, while Martin was mussing
clumsily about the lock, put a scrawny shoulder to the door,
and pryed it open, as it were, in the face of the stupefied
landlord and his guests.</p>

<p>The face that followed the shoulder was a very sharp and
intelligent one, and not a disagreeable one either in its way,
but its way was very Yankee and very hard, very square
about the mouth, and very inquisitive about the eyes, just
the sort of face, in point of fact, to throw the honest landlord 
into a cold perspiration.</p>

<p>"Hay!" he stammered, retreating a step or two, but still
holding to the door, although the stranger was by this time
comfortably inside of it. "I&mdash;vell&mdash;vatt, vatt tu you
vant?"</p>

<p>"Want; why my good friend, I want to warm my hands
a bit, and sit down by this fire o' you'rn, and get a bite
o' supper, maybe, if there's any round," the newcomer said
with astonishing <i>sang-froid</i>, as, rubbing his hands together,
he walked over to the fire, nodding familiarly to the petrified 
smokers around the room, and slinging his pack down

<!-- page 151 -->

from his shoulder in the corner next the table. It was
wonderful to watch the clever way in which he kept his
ground. After a while the astonishment and silence of
the men began to thaw, and there were some scowls and
growls bestowed upon him as he drew up his chair in front
of the fire, and stretched out his lean legs to the heat.</p>

<p>"Pretty fire, that," he said, expanding his bony hands
upon his knees; "remarkable pretty fire. Takes Ulster
County to grow hickory. Never saw a log blaze like that
over our way."</p>

<p>A pause, during which Caspar grunted and the rest of
the party smoked.</p>

<p>"Hickory like that," he continued, meditatively, "would
fetch&mdash;well&mdash;lemme think&mdash;would fetch&mdash;twelve shillin' a
cord, cut and drawed, any part o' Connecticut."</p>

<p>"Ne-o," cried Caspar, thrown entirely off his guard, for
he had acres upon acres of the finest hickory that ever nodded, 
two miles back from the creek, and flesh and blood
could not stand unmoved the history of such prices as that.
Two or three of the men who had less woodland said
"whew!" and those who had not any, sniffed contemptuously 
and did not say anything.</p>

<p>"Fact," said the stranger, bringing his lips together with
a smack, and making his unhandsome mouth a straight line
during several seconds of impressive silence. "Fact; I've
paid that much hard money down for it myself, many's the
time. An' with as many yoke of oxen as some of you big
farmers roun' here have got, 'twouldn't be a bad speculation, 
to my notion, to draw a lot of it over 'cross the line,
and peddle it among the folks our way."</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

"Peddlin' ish not our callin'," growled the landlord from
the further end of the room, where, astride of a half-barrel
of beer, he was gradually recovering himself.</p>

<p>"Might have a wuss, friend," said the Yankee, laughing
all over his hard face. "You'd fine it a sight better'n entertainin' 
peddlers," no doubt he would have added if he
had not been restrained by prudence.</p>

<p>From timber he edged on to garden-seeds, and meeting
with less and less opposition at every step, he at last
resolved upon pushing a bold move, and stooped down to
open his pack, talking volubly all the time. But this was
premature. A well-defined "Na, na," rose from the smokers; 
so he covered his failure with the remark that he was
looking for some cards he had, to show 'em a trick he'd
learned yesterday from an old French sergeant who was
coming down the river on a raft. Now a trick with cards
the Yankee knew would carry any bar-room instantly,
pledged to no matter what hostility; and many a night's
lodging had this same "new trick" obtained for him. Indeed, 
the cards had grown grey in the service, grey and
grimy too, and they almost shuffled themselves and slid into
their places on his knee, so familiar were they with the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
they had to play, and the fiction of the old French sergeant
had long since ceased to raise a blush on the greasy faces of
the royal family. The men slowly gathered in a circle round
him, old Martin, even, plucked himself up from the beer-barrel, 
and approaching, looked over his shoulder with
cautious wonder. The "new trick" was a success, and was
rapidly followed by other tricks, to the full as wonderful
and as original; the audience were thoroughly excited and

<!-- page 153 -->

warmed up, and at length a little mild betting grew out of
the enthusiasm kindled. The Yankee was so unfortunate
as to lose; on two separate occasions he had to hand out
a shiny shilling to his delighted bettee.</p>

<p>But at last, as it seemed, driven to desperation by his
losses, he started up and exclaimed, Wall now, there was
one more bet he was willin' to make; he didn't care who
took it up, he'd show they couldn't beat him every hand;
he was willin' to swallow the biggest man in the room for
two pound ten. He had the money ready; let any man
put it up, an' he'd show him.</p>

<p>An incredulous ha! ha! greeted this; but the thimble-rigging 
spirit was so a-flame, there was little difficulty in
persuading Martin, as the biggest man present, to take up
the bet, and in the enthusiasm of the moment, he went out
into the lean-to, and from the chest under the bed, brought
back an old stocking, and from it counted out the money.
The peddler, too, produced his from the bottom of his
trowsers pocket, and Caspar van Hausen held the stakes.</p>

<p>"Well," cried the men eagerly, as they watched the
cadaverous Yankee's deliberate survey of the huge Dutchman's 
solid front. "Well, why don't you do it?"</p>

<p>"Aye, vhy ton't you?" muttered the old man, suddenly
remembering, with a little sinking of the heart, the suspicious 
ham and Amen's abominable suggestion.</p>

<p>"Why don't I, eh?" he returned. "I didn't engage to
swaller his clothes. He's got to strip, I'm a waitin'."</p>

<p>"Come then, Martin," laughed the men, crowding round
him. "No backin' out. Come."</p>

<p>"Na, na," protested Martin, making a stout resistance.

<!-- page 154 -->

"I'll none o' dis. I'll e'en take pack my moneys. Gif it
to me, Caspar. I titn't say I'd strip."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! ye're in for it. Ye're pound, or ye losh
yor moneys," cried Caspar, fully bent on seeing all the fun.</p>

<p>"Ye can't take back the money now," the others echoed.</p>

<p>Martin, looking very miserable, glanced at the emptied
stocking and offered no further resistance, as his zealous
friends assisted him in getting rid of the major part of his
clothing. Setting all pecuniary anxiety aside, he had a
great deal to distress him: his personal dignity was much
outraged; he began to feel the utmost uneasiness at the
contemptible position in which he found himself, as steadying 
himself against the wall, he barely kept himself from
falling, while a brace of giggling lads drew, first one long
blue hose and then another, from his ponderous limbs.</p>

<p>"There, there," said the peddler compassionately, "that's
enough. I don't mind the underclothes. It's only the
thick woollen things I can't stomach. Now, my man; are
ye ready? Draw out the table, then, and git him up
on it."</p>

<p>But upon this, Martin sat plump down on the floor, and
refused to budge. He wouldn't git up on the table for no
man, not he. Then the stranger made a feint of taking the
money from Caspar's hand, and the company all declared
he was in the right of it if he did; and at last, with a
groan, Martin suffered himself to be helped up on his legs
again and led over to the table, which, with all the pomp
and circumstance of war, the Yankee had drawn out into
the middle of the room, and the strength of which he had
tried repeatedly, by vaulting up on it, and shaking and

<!-- page 155 -->

thumping upon it with impudent familiarity and assurance.
It is not probable that any person, not actually suffering
capital punishment, ever endured worse pangs than this
unhappy landlord did, as with infinite exertion he was
hoisted upon the table and exhorted to stretch himself out
at full length upon it.</p>

<p>The Yankee, passing his lank fingers through his hair
and pushing up his sleeves, then said impressively: "Now,
gentlemen, I must ask ye to step back a-ways; stand a
little to the left of the body, and gi' me plenty o' room.
Now, all ready?"</p>

<p>"The body" gasped faintly, "Ye'es," and shut his eyes.
A silence fell; curiosity held the breath even of Amen.
For the space of several seconds, it is no figure of speech
to say, the dropping of a pin would have been a startling
and audible occurrence.</p>

<p>Then the solemn operator, after surveying him from all
points, halted at length at the foot of the table, stooped
down and applied his capacious mouth to the great toe of
his victim. It must have been a dainty mouthful! but the
New England taste was not proverbial for its delicacy at
that period of our colonial history, and the peddler even
seemed to enter with relish on his undertaking.</p>

<p>An instant after, there came a loud crack of the huge
toe-joint, and contemporaneously with that event, came a
vigorous kick in the face of the peddler, which sent him
sprawling on his back, and a volley of oaths thundered
from the lips of the enraged landlord, as he regained a
sitting posture, and shook his fist at his fallen foe.</p>

<p>"De sneakin', teivin' Yankee! Catch him! He's proke

<!-- page 156 -->

my pig toe-joint! I'll murter him! I'll have him hung up
py de hair! I'll"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why," said the Yankee, picking himself up and hitching 
up his trowsers with unshaken assurance, "what did ye
want? Ye didn't expect I'd <i>swaller ye whole</i>, did you? I
thought ye knowed I'd have to crack the bones!"</p>

<p>But above the roar of laughter that this called forth,
thundered the heavy artillery of the landlord's imprecations; 
he rolled down from his table in hot wrath, and
made for his antagonist as fast as his maimed member
would permit, and would no doubt have fallen upon him
and done him mortal injury if the more peace-loving of the
assembly had not restrained his violence and held him back
by force. Seizing which favorable moment, the Yankee,
who was as prudent as he was clever, sidled over to his
pack, and talking pacifically all the while, strapped it to his
shoulder, and then held out his hand to Caspar for the
money.</p>

<p>"I've arned it, you know," he said very nasally, but very
logically. "I've arned it, ef he won't let me go on an'
finish up the job. I'm willin' an' waitin'. I call you gentlemen 
all to witness ef I hevn't arned it lawful."</p>

<p>There was a temporary silence, but nobody could say he
had not earned it. He was willing to complete his part,
but the landlord was not willing to go on with <i>his;</i> who
could say he had not a right to the money? Nobody 
could say it, and nobody did say it, and so, with many
apologies to the company for leaving them so soon, he laid
five very quiet but very irresistible fingers upon the leathern
pouch in Caspar's half unwilling hand, and worming his

<!-- page 157 -->

way to the door, scraped a graceful good-night to his host,
now foaming at the mouth with rage, and with an inward
chuckle, resumed his travels, defrauded of the lodgings he
had expected, but richer by two pounds eight shillings, and
by many a future laugh.</p>

<p>"And what did you do meanwhile, Amen?" said Larry,
laughing. "I'll lay a wager you didn't keep your black
fingers altogether out of the pie."</p>

<p>Amen hung his head with a beautiful modesty and he-he'd 
in a minor key, while Dave called out:</p>

<p>"Ask him what became of old Martin's clothes, Massa
Larry!"</p>

<p>"Well, what did, Amen?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't find 'em, Massa Larry."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>But Amen was incapable of being straightforward on a
question which involved any transaction of his own; so,
more by inference than admission, the rest of Martin's misfortunes 
came to light. It appeared that some ten minutes
after the departure of the stranger, the fury of the land
lord having in a measure expended itself, the ignominy of
his demi-toilet suggested itself to his mind, and he began
to look around for his clothes.</p>

<p>"Vind me my toublet, zum o' ye," he said, hoarse with
swearing. "Ye was handy enough to get it off me."</p>

<p>Smitten with this reproach, two or three of the loungers
turned to look for it; but, alas! it was nowhere to be seen.
The same held true as regarded shoes, hose and breeches.
There were many astonished and uncomfortable looks
exchanged as this amazing piece of effrontery was disclosed,

<!-- page 158 -->

and it became evident how accomplished a villain they had
had among them.</p>

<p>Martin's wrath knew no bounds; half naked as he was,
he bolted out of doors, swearing vengeance and demanding
a pursuit. But as he was disabled, for obvious reasons,
from heading it himself, and as no one else in the company
showed the slightest intention of seconding him, he was at
length obliged to retire to the stronghold of the lean-to,
and to the great scandal of Gretchen, his wife, hide his
defeat under the bed-clothes; and the sharp tones of her
scolding voice were the last the dispersing revellers heard
as they took up their tardy march toward their respective
Gretchens.</p>

<p>All this Amen acknowledged to have seen, flattening his
nose against the window-pane outside.</p>

<p>"Well, Amen, do you think the Yankee took 'em?"</p>

<p>"He, he, massa, I guess not."</p>

<p>"Where are they, then?"</p>

<p>"I guess they'll fine 'em when they come to bake. I
shouldn't wonder ef they foun' 'em in the oven."</p>

<p>"Oh, you limb!" said Lawrence, laughing, as he waved
him off. "Get out of my sight&mdash;to bed with you this
minute."</p>

<p>"Aye," cried Salome, waddling across the kitchen to get
the men their candles. "Limb indeed. I wonder anybody
kin feel safe wid him in the house. Whatever he was made
fur, I can't think, except it was to show folks the devil
didn't confine himself to Yankees. He'll blow us up or
drownd us, 'fore we know it, if we don't look out."</p>

<p>"Lookin' out won't do much good," muttered Rube,

<!-- page 159 -->

clumping off toward bed. "That imp with the Scriptur
name'll be the death of us all, you mark my words."</p>

<p>And thoroughly impressed with his manifest destiny, and
very much delighted with its importance, Amen, grinning
and chuckling, followed in the rear of the retreating phalanx, 
and left his betters to the enjoyment of his wickedness
and his wit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was always a cosy hour round the sitting-room fire,
that last one before bed-time, after the men had all gone to
their loft, and Salome had put her bread in the "last position" 
before the smoldering fire and left it to its fate, and
Nattee had closed the shutters and bolted the doors and
put a fresh log on the andirons, and dropped her last courtesy 
(with the chance of nobody seeing it), and taken her
lonely way up to her lonely little room. It was very cosy
for those who stayed and drew up round the fire, but it
was very chilly and forlorn for Steady and for Nattee, who
didn't stay. On this particular evening, it had been harder
than ever to go away from the light and warmth of the
sitting-room; Steady was a little sleepy, and bobbed her
courtesy and trudged very uncomplainingly up to bed, but
Nattee was so wide awake, and so interested in the talking,
how could she go?</p>

<p>After exhausting every possible excuse for staying in the
room, and being hurried off at last by a half-impatient
"Nattee, don't be all night tinkering at those shutters!"

<!-- page 161 -->

from Larry, she hastily picked up her candle and retreated.
Not very far, however. She sat down for a minute to
recover breath on the top step of the cellar stairs, and
glancing back into the room, found the position commanded 
so fine a view of the circle at the fire, she forgot
to go any further, and sat leaning forward on her elbows,
resting her chin on her hands, and gazing into the room,
while the draught from the cellar made terrible work with
her flickering candle, and dashed the melting tallow into
many fantastic molds.</p>

<p>How handsome Larry looked as he bent over his mother,
and forcibly disengaging her hands from her work, led her
over to the great chair he had drawn up for her by the
fire.</p>

<p>"No more of that tiresome wheel to-night!" he exclaimed, 
throwing himself down on the settle and leaning
on his elbow. "Come, Warren, give the Fathers a holiday.
Come over to the fire."</p>

<p>And Warren, with a smile, shut his book, extinguished
his little study lamp and came over to the fire. This was
only an intermission in his night's toil; more hours than
any one in the house guessed, that faithful little lamp
burned under his weary eyes, but for this hour, the last of
their evening, and almost the beginning of his, he was
always glad to lay the books aside. But how pale and
thin he looked, as, leaning back in his chair, he fixed his
eyes dreamily on the fire. The delicacy of his face had
grown almost startling; not effeminate, not unmanly, not
even sickly and wan, but spiritualized and refined from
sense, and infinitely sad. Thought and study and discipline

<!-- page 162 -->

had added their subtle beauty to his eyes; there was
immortal youth in the fairness of his features, but keenness
of intellect and strength of soul in the indescribable repose
and thoughtfulness of both.</p>

<p>"Laura, my child," said Mrs. Sutherland, in the half-anxious, 
trembling tone that was becoming almost querulous, 
"why will you strain your eyes over that work at
night? Do put it up, I beg. Let Lawrence move your
frame back to its place."</p>

<p>Laura submissively obeyed, which Lawrence also did,
but with a little show of indolence and want of alacrity,
and pushed a chair up for her by the fire. She altered its
position till she could lean on Warren's and a short silence
ensued, broken by Larry's sudden laugh, "That villainous
Amen! Laura, there's a home mission for you without
further search."</p>

<p>"That would be no charity in the end," said Laura, "for
it would be taking your work away."</p>

<p>"Mine? not a bit of it. I wash my hands of all the
farm. After the first November I make over all my share
of the moral responsibility of it to Warren."</p>

<p>"That sort of stock is not transferable, I think you will
find, my friend. I should be very happy to relieve you,
but I am afraid it is not in my power, nor in the power of
any mortal man, for the matter of that."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Lawrence. "Do you mean to say a
man has no way of ridding himself of the moral responsibility 
of his slaves as long as he owns them? Not that I
really think of shifting them upon you, but I might, if we
were both agreed."</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>"I doubt it. There are few duties that can be shifted.
Do you think a mother is ever rid of the responsibility
of her children? Do you think a pastor is ever rid of the
responsibility of his people? Never, believe me, whatever
deputies they may put between them and their duties.
People cannot do alms by proxy, cannot practise self-denial 
by proxy, any more than they can go to church,
say their prayers and praise God by proxy. It is a personal 
matter, it cannot be shifted; with our own hands,
in our own hearts we have to work it out. And half
of us spend half our lives in trying to get rid of what
we never can be rid till God decrees. I do not mean
to preach, Larry; I know you're not in earnest, but
you'll let me tell you this: not I, nor the whole bench of
bishops, could ease you of the responsibility of governing
or misgoverning those whom God has set you over. We
might save their souls, you would peril yours. The government 
of households rests with those whom God has
placed over them, and personally the heads of families are
responsible. It is the disregard of this, the indifference of
men to these directions of Providence in the government
of the world that puts things so awry. If men would only
attend to their personal duties and responsibilities, and let
all philanthropy alone that went outside of the circle of
those duties and responsibilities, the anarchy, the insubordination, 
the irreligion would be cut down by half."</p>

<p>"The Pertinaxes would be out of fuel in that case," said
Laura.</p>

<p>"And a happy day it would be for the world," muttered
Lawrence. "That fanatical old incendiary has set afire all

<!-- page 164 -->

that is combustible in the neighborhood. If our slaves
hadn't been 'seasoned timber,' they'd have been all in a
flame by this time. Such stirring doctrine as he gave
'em last Sunday, by all accounts, would have put any
ordinary intellects in a ferment; but, happily (with a
laugh), Rube's and Dave's are no ordinary intellects.
They know on which side their bread is buttered, and
that implies an extraordinary degree of intelligence, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"It is rather an unsafe tenure to hold them by, though,
my friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, a little depression in the butter market, and
they're off, whizz&mdash;like partridges, I suppose. But a master's 
care must be, I take it, to keep the butter supply
generous and invariable, and then the chances are in his
favor that his slaves stick by him and serve him well."</p>

<p>"Did it never strike you it would be a safer plan to
teach the slave his duty, besides giving him his bread
and butter? To give him some simple, reasonable instructions 
about the relation that exists between you and him
and what is expected of you both? To explain to him
the position he is in, and tell him who put him in that
position? For men are not born by chance, showered
about the world at random; a slave who is born in that
condition, has been made a slave by God, and has as clear
a line of duty to follow as his master, or his fellow-laborer,
born a freeman. Teach him that duty, instruct his conscience 
with the light of Christianity, give him some
weapons, no matter how rough and simple, as long as they
are weapons of truth, to defend himself against such mistaken 

<!-- page 165 -->

and unhappy preachers, and you need not fear
them. They will be preaching insubordination, rebellion
against the authority that holds him in the lowest grade
of life, but his wiser heart will be preaching patience:
endurance, at the least, of the condition in which it has
pleased God to place him, and faith that God will make
it all right for him, if not in this world, in the next. Such
homely maxims will sound very flat and tame, no doubt,
after the ranting eloquence of abolition preachers, but they
are God's truth, and it is safe to believe, <i>that</i> can live and
do its work without the help of fine words from any mortal
preacher."</p>

<p>"Well, Warren, may you succeed in getting some of that
truth into their minds! Heaven forgive me, I'm afraid
they've heard little enough of it yet! I am afraid their
self-interest has been the only principle that has been
appealed to. They, as well as we, will have cause to bless
your coming, if you can put things on a better foundation
than they are on now. I have always felt that somehow it
was all wrong, but I haven't given the subject thought
enough."</p>

<p>"And, Lawrence, I know no subject that, for us, requires
more thought. You were born the master of slaves; I
have assumed to be the teacher of slaves; so, both of us
this question touches nearly. And it is such a sad question,
in its best phase, to every thinking man, that we shall not
be tempted to treat it lightly, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Lightly!" repeated Laura, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"But the world is so full of great evils and great sadnesses 
that we must not cry out, This cannot be borne&mdash;this 

<!-- page 166 -->

is the worst evil that has ever been! Who knows
whether this outward bondage that they wear is any more
cruel than the plague of many a free man's secret heart?
Every man who has suffered knows what discipline means;
he knows no soul can be saved without it. What if this
discipline is for the saving of their souls? And there might
be harder ways, God knows! As long, then, as slavery
exists by God's permission, we must take it as one of the
sadnesses that He has placed before us in our fallen world,
to remind us of our impotence and our ignorance. We
cannot see why it should be permitted; we cannot see why
plague, and famine, and war should be permitted&mdash;why
thousands upon thousands of unready souls should be swept
to death, without a moment's grace&mdash;why millions upon
millions of heathen souls should live and die in ignorance
worse than death; we cannot always see the reasonableness
of the Divine Reasoner, nor the justice of the Immutable
Judge, but we can submit, we can acknowledge our own
ignorance, and believe in His wisdom. And what remains
for us is to keep our own hands pure from the blood of all
men, our own hearts attentive to the duties that lie around
us. We are not responsible for the world, we are responsible
solely for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Old Pertinax would tell you, you take a narrow
view."</p>

<p>"Then he would give me the key-note of his own errors:
he takes too broad a view. He overlooks his own personal
duties, in looking out so far upon the duty of the world.
He preaches what the pity of his own kind heart suggests,
instead of what the higher wisdom of God's pity commands.

<!-- page 167 -->

The Bible he professes to live by commands submission to
the ordinances of man for the Lord's sake&mdash;obedience to
those who have the rule&mdash;contentment with our lot in life,
whatever it may be; and he, in his blind zeal, and indiscriminating 
pity, preaches to his hearers of their rights as
men, their wrongs as slaves&mdash;holds up rebellion as a virtue,
resistance as a duty. Is this man preaching out of the
Bible, or out of his own heart? I can tell him there is
nothing harder than to shut up one's own yearning human
heart, and turn to the stern rules of God's eternal Law. I
pity the enslaved, to the full, as much as he pities them;
but I should hold myself guilty of a deadly sin, were I to
let my pity for them warp the message that God sends to
them by me, in ever such a slight degree. And I have still
to find in that same Law the warrant that he finds to tell
their owners that they sin in holding as their own the
inheritance of their fathers. The man that would extend
this evil, that would seize and bend under this sad bondage
fresh and helpless victims, would be so vile and hard a man,
no message, though one rose from the dead to deliver it in
his ears, would reach his heart. But the man who, if his
conscience so allows him, chooses to retain and faithfully
discharge the heavy duty that is owing to his slaves, cannot
receive my censure. He must, though (forgive me, Larry)
he must have my pity."</p>

<p>"Save it, my dear parson, save it for those who need it
more," cried Larry, with an uneasy laugh, as he got up and
walked across the room and back, his short <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of seriousness 
quite played out. "I wouldn't trust you with the offer
of a brace of likely hands to work the perspective glebe,

<!-- page 168 -->

nor the gift of pretty Nattee, even, to keep the Parsonage
in order!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Laura, warmly, "you might trust him,
without the smallest danger to your property&mdash;he would
never touch it"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Lawrence, stopping short in his walk, and
looking down at her intently. "You, yourself, would never
own or keep a slave&mdash;you are resolved, then?"</p>

<p>"Never" began Laura, with unusual warmth; but
Warren put his hand upon her mouth.</p>

<p>" 'Sweetest my sister,' none of that. Vows should
never be born of excitement and sudden feeling. Make
your resolutions coolly and dispassionately; there will be
more chance of having some warmth and vitality left to
keep them, if you have not expended all on the making."</p>

<p>"You are not so cold as you profess, though," Laura
said, looking down, much humbled, and paying the penalty
of her unwonted fervor with unwonted blushes. "You
know you would not own a slave; you know you do not
blame my feeling so about it."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you, but I don't applaud you, my dear
Laura, for I know your enthusiasm comes all of feeling, and
not at all of reflection. You take a very feminine, unreasoning 
view of the case, and judge, as women generally
judge, in the most unreliable, yet the most natural, and
perhaps the most subtly true manner."</p>

<p>"Make that clear, if you please, my dear brother,"</p>

<p>"He can't make it clear to you, if your instinct don't
catch it at once," cried Lawrence. "A woman can't reason&mdash;a 
woman can't be convinced. If you can make her feel a

<!-- page 169 -->

thing, you can convey it to her; if you have to present it to
her reason, you have a hopeless task before you. I'd sooner
teach Amen the alphabet, any day."</p>

<p>"Aunt Andria, let me get a screen for you, the fire
burns your face;" and Laura moved across the room,
quietly and gracefully, yet with a chilling queenliness, and
in her voice, low and musical as it was, there rang the
shivering of a myriad slender icicles; and between her cold
eyes and her cousin's, when at length they met, there was a
frost-work of disdain that the moment had created, but
which he could not melt, fairy-like and fragile as it
seemed.</p>

<p>Impatient of the subject that had caused all this trouble,
yet longing to provoke another flash of spirit from her,
Lawrence launched into another and a nearer source of
difference between them, to wit, the glorious Revolution,
and their Orange Highnesses of blessed memory. But he
had frozen the pretty wrath he longed to listen to, perhaps
forever&mdash;who could tell? Women were such wayward,
unaccountable creations, and this one was the most wayward 
and unaccountable of all. Not one word, good or
bad, did she speak again; not one look, gracious or ungracious, 
did he get for all his ingenious impudence and well-affected 
heresies. With her pretty white hands lying idly
in her lap, she sat quietly gazing into the fire, not a vestige
of emotion of any kind marring the admirable repose of
her face. She neither looked dreamy, nor absent, nor angry&mdash;she 
looked nothing. Warren's pithy reasoning, Lawrence's 
clever sneering, failed to wake the faintest change
of feature; they might as well have bandied jokes across

<!-- page 170 -->

the white shoulders of the Venus of the Tribune, for any
effect apparent on the statue.</p>

<p>It was not the fire alone that had burned Mrs. Sutherland's 
face. She was uneasy and perplexed at Larry's
boldness and self-will, and though she could not enter into
any of the arguments that had arisen, she could feel the
right and wrong of them most deeply, and had felt them
many silent years. And she saw, too, that Laura was
angry, worse than angry, down to the very depths of her
woman's heart. What did it mean, this unreasonable prejudice 
of Larry's, generally so generous and good-hearted?
She longed to break off his provoking controversy with
Warren, and, in the very first pause which occurred, she
said:</p>

<p>"I am sure, Warren, you and Larry have forgotten the
cider you were counting on so last week. You haven't so
much as tasted it. I've a mind to go down to the cellar
and get you a pitcher full; and Laura will get that plate
of cake from the side-board. Won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>Laura got the plate of cake from the side-board, and then
quietly taking the pitcher and candle from her aunt, insisted
unanswerably on going down for the cider. Gentle Mrs.
Sutherland yielded to everybody, so it was not wonderful
she yielded to Laura, but she watched her rather anxiously
as, burdened with the candle and the pitcher, and a plate
for some apples, she reached the door.</p>

<p>"Lawrence, my son," she said, uneasily, for the young
men were again engrossed in talking, "can't you help your
cousin? She will have more things to bring up than she
can carry."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"I don't need any help, Aunt Andria," Laura protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;of course," Lawrence said, and
following her, he took the candle and pitcher from her
hand. He went down first, holding the candle high to
light the young lady's descent, and, when he reached the
bottom, turned and offered her his hand. But she could
not be made to see it; her eyes were downcast, and all her
mind seemed bent on the matter of saving her white dress
from contact with the rough staircase down which she was
obliged to pass. Lawrence bit his lip as he turned away.
Here was a contest hardly worth his trying; yet he was
resolved, before she went up those stairs again, he would
be master of that hand, if but for an instant, and look into
her eyes, if but to reiterate the story of his indifference and
contempt.</p>

<p>"Which barrel does my mother mean?" he asked, setting 
down the candle on the head of one, and turning to
his cousin, who was standing in the middle of the cellar.</p>

<p>"I think she intended to have that used first," the young
lady returned, indicating, with a very slight gesture, a barrel 
in the opposite corner.</p>

<p>"There's no difference in them," said Lawrence, perversely, 
stooping down and examining the coopering. "I
saw them headed up myself; they are precisely alike. This
one will do just as well;" and he proceeded to remove the
plug.</p>

<p>Now any one who has ever gone down into the cellar
after dark on an errand of this kind, knows that it is no
easy task for one pair of hands to hold the candle where it
will light anything but the beams or the bare ground, and

<!-- page 172 -->

the pitcher where it won't spill the cider, and the plug so
that it can be replaced at the critical moment. One pair
of hands is manifestly insufficient, and Lawrence meant it
should appear so. When the candle was on the barrel
head, for all purposes of illumination it might as well have
been in the attic, and when he set it on the ground, it
flickered, and sputtered, and did not throw a ray of light
upon the barrel, or upon anything but the ground and the
half raised skirt of Laura's white dress, and the piquant
little foot below it, that tapped the ground in absence or
impatience.</p>

<p>"Be kind enough to hold the candle for me, Laura, will
you?" he said very matter-of-factly, handing her the candle.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," she answered, in the same tone,
not approaching and not offering to take it.</p>

<p>"No, upon my word I can't excuse you," he said,
between his teeth, as he looked down at her. "Why won't
you take it, pray?"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>And Lawrence got the glance he wanted; but such a
glittering look, such a subtle, chilling hauteur as informed
that delicate and speaking face. He had time for a full
gaze into the eyes he had been so long trying to meet; but
such freezing eyes! And then she moved away as a young
queen would. She seemed to think the path would clear
before her of itself, and that it did not matter who was
between her and the stairs, there was no one of temerity
enough to stand where she chose to pass.</p>

<p>"No! One word, my pretty cousin," said Lawrence,
placing himself before the entrance.</p>

<!-- page 173 -->

<p>But at that moment there came a crash, so near, so sudden, 
even strong-nerved Larry gave a start, and with the
start the treacherous candle, meeting some new gust of
wind, expired abruptly, leaving them in utter darkness and
unutterable astonishment. That it might be something
worse than astonishment on his companion's part, however,
Lawrence guessed from the quick gasp that caught his ear,
and starting forward, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Laura; it's nothing. Give me
your hand; here are the stairs."</p>

<p>And grasping the cold hand that neither resisted nor
yielded, he led her to the stairs, realizing, through all the
perplexity and surprise of his position, the triumph he had
promised to himself. But before they reached the stairs, the
outstretched hand, with which he was groping through the
thick darkness of the cellar-way, struck something human&mdash;warm, 
smooth, breathing flesh. Holding Laura back
peremptorily, and suppressing the exclamation that rose to
his lips, he laid a firm grasp upon the stealthy intruder, and
called in a stentorian voice:</p>

<p>"Warren! bring us a light, will you?"</p>

<p>The cellar was under the unused half of the house; the
cellar door was a tolerably heavy one, and the hall was not
a narrow one, added to which, the sitting-room door had
fallen, or been pushed shut since they had left it, all of
which presented but a slim chance of success for even
Larry's lusty lungs. He called again with tremendous
strength, but not a movement in the hall above indicated
that his voice had penetrated to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Here was a situation never matched for awkwardness,

<!-- page 174 -->

he thought, as he listened vainly for an answer to his call,
supporting Laura with one hand, and keeping down his
unknown enemy with the other. Of what sex, age, or
condition that enemy might be, he could not form any
satisfactory conjecture. That it was human he was sure,
and almost inhumanly strong he was equally and uncomfortably 
sure. It was a throat he grasped, or one hand
would never have sufficed to hold such muscle in check for
the space of half a minute; and except that all effort was
for release, and none for attack, he should have doubted
his power of sustaining the struggle till help came. The
necessity of keeping Laura in ignorance of the presence of
a third and hostile party, increased rather than decreased
as time passed. She was trembling all over, he felt distinctly 
through the cold hand by which he supported her,
and he listened rather apprehensively to the vain attempts
she made to command voice enough to answer his careless
questions. It was by no means an easy thing to put careless 
questions in a natural voice, with such an unremitting
strain upon one's nerves and muscle going on; but Larry
managed to do it, and to keep his companion in a blissful
ignorance of the little circumstance, the least suspicion of
which would have sent her off in a fainting fit.</p>

<p>"There's no use in stumbling up those stairs without a
light," he said, quite nonchalantly. "Strange we can't
make 'em hear. Warren! What a night it is! Hark!
do you hear the wind blowing? Could it have been that
Rube didn't fasten up the shutters well, and that they were
what blew down. Stand back a little, Laura, you are just
in the draught from the window. I say, Warren! Bring

<!-- page 175 -->

a light, will you? Ah!" with a sudden relief in his voice,
"there he comes, we shall soon see our way out of this."</p>

<p>In an instant after the first sound above had apprised
him his voice had reached the fireside, the cellar door
burst open, and Warren, carrying the large lamp from the
table, descended three steps hastily, followed by Mrs.
Sutherland, and then both stood still, transfixed with
wonder at the scene before them. The place was flooded
with light, to the remotest corner, and no item, from the
extinguished candle lying on the ground, to the overturned
barrel and shelves beside the stairs, escaped the amazed,
and speechless spectators. But the group, of which these
things were the surroundings! Larry, holding back his cousin, 
pale and fainting, with one hand, while with the other,
he held a grasp on the throat of Nattee, crouching at his feet.</p>

<p>"Lawrence! Have you lost your senses?" exclaimed
Warren, when he could speak for wonder.</p>

<p>"Nattee, by Heavens!" exclaimed Lawrence, in a tone
of thunder, starting back and flinging her from him.
"What does this mean? Speak&mdash;quick&mdash;speak, or I'll
make you. What were you doing here&mdash;what does this
mean?"</p>

<p>"Let me go, oh, let me go!" she prayed, for he had laid
his hand again upon her shoulder as he spoke, and held her
back; "let me go. I'll never come near you again&mdash;I'll
never trouble you any more. I didn't mean to do anything
wrong&mdash;I'm&mdash;oh! I'm so miserable!" and covering her
face with her hands, she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"You shall not escape with that," he muttered. Then,
in answer to Warren's reiterated question, what <i>does</i> it all

<!-- page 176 -->

mean? he exclaimed angrily: "Mean! why it means just
this, as far as I can tell you. That girl there, skulking
hidden about the cellar, eaves-dropping, or pilfering, or
both, upset a pile of lumber in the corner, and nearly
frightened Laura to death with the noise, and in the melee
I dropped the candle, and we were left in total darkness.
I started to grope my way and lead Laura up the stairs,
and stumbled over something at the foot of 'em; and you
may well believe, a human something isn't a pleasant
thing to stumble over in the dark. I didn't want Laura
to go off in a faint on my hands, and she was so precious
near it all the time, I didn't dare to let go her hand for a
moment, so I had to manage my friend with my left, and
she struggled like a tiger, I can tell you, and I had
concluded you had all grown as deaf as posts, for I shouted
till I was hoarse. Go up, Laura; I think we've had
enough of the cellar for to-night."</p>

<p>"Poor Nattee has, at least, I think," said Warren, <i>sotto
voce</i>, as he led the way up into the hall.</p>

<p>"Yes, and poor Laura, and poor Lawrence," muttered
the latter impatiently, as he strode into the sitting-room,
"Mother! send that girl up to bed. I'll settle my account
with her to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You are unreasonable, Lawrence," murmured his
mother, following anxiously with her eyes the girl's
retreat. "No one ever dreamed of accusing Nattee of
eaves-dropping or pilfering before. I cannot believe it of
her."</p>

<p>"I am no more anxious to believe it than you are," he
returned, going to the fire. "But I am puzzled to give

<!-- page 177 -->

any other explanation to her appearance in the cellar, when
she was supposed to have gone to bed an hour before."</p>

<p>"There are a good many puzzling things in this world,
Larry, my friend," said Warren, as he sat down to his
books. " 'Judge not by the appearance, but judge righteous 
judgment,' which is all one with saying, appearances
are snares."</p>

<p>"Yes. But we of the laity have to depend a little on
them," Larry retorted, thoroughly out of temper. "We
haven't your light, you know, we can't see into people's
hearts."</p>

<p>"You miss some very pretty views, then," said Warren,
with a slight laugh. "Where's Laura?"</p>

<p>"Gone after Nattee, I think," Mrs. Sutherland said, with
an apprehensive glance toward Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Nattee, Nattee&mdash;let me in, won't you?" Laura whispered 
at the door of Nattee's little room in the attic. No
answer; but the absence of bolts and bars was in Laura's
favor, and she softly lifted the latch and entered. The
window had not been shut, and a strong current of air was
rushing in from the cold night; so Laura closed it, and
then went over and sat down on the foot of the low
trundle-bed, where Nattee lay sobbing. As Nattee would
do nothing but sob, and would neither look up nor answer
any question, Laura sat still for a few minutes, and looked
about the room. It was an odd corner of the attic, partitioned 
off, and roughly plastered, with great beams overhead,
and a narrow window, with a deep stone ledge. Scanty and
simple as the furniture of the room was, it all looked as if
it all belonged to pretty, neat, quick-handed Nattee's room.</p>

<!-- page 178 -->

<p>"One could tell Aunt Andria had brought her up,"
thought Laura, looking at the coarse, but white and well-made 
bed. "Poor Nattee! I'm afraid she will find it
has been mistaken kindness, if she survives her tender-hearted 
mistress!"</p>

<p>"Nattee, look up, and tell me what you are crying for.
<i>I</i>'m not angry with you. I do not believe you were
meaning to do wrong, and neither does your mistress. Look
up and tell me if you were."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. I don't care what anybody thinks.
I wish I were dead! I'm so miserable!"</p>

<p>"Nattee, Nattee! that does not sound like you. I am
sure you are sorry if you have done wrong, and there is
nothing else we need be sorry about, you know."</p>

<p>It would have been a stauncher obstinacy than poor
Nattee's yielding nature ever sustained her in, that could
have withstood the magic of Laura's sympathy and
kindness. She told her at last all her misfortunes, and
the causes of them: how hard it had been to come up to
bed, and how she had loitered on the cellar stairs, till their
sudden approach had thrown her into a great flutter of
alarm. They had been almost upon her, before she realized
her danger, and no retreat was left her but the cellar,
down into which, without a second's pause, she had
bounded, blowing out her candle as she went, and crouching 
breathless behind some barrels under the stairs. An
incautious movement, as they approached her, had thrown
the barrels down; and all the rest Laura knew before, and
how sharply the poor girl had paid for her loitering and
love of listening.</p>

<!-- page 179 -->

<p>"Well Nattee," said Laura, as she rose to go, "it's all
over, and you did not mean to do wrong, I am sure. I
will explain all about it to my aunt."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of <i>her</i>," murmured Nattee.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lawrence then? I will make it all right with him.
You need not be afraid. Good night."</p>

<p>If Laura thought she had healed the wound in poor
Nattee's heart, it was only because she knew nothing at all
about it, and had not seen any farther into its troubled,
dark recesses than most people ever see into their neighbors' 
hearts, or know of their neighbors' deepest, sharpest,
most enduring pangs.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Making</span> it all right with Mr. Lawrence was a thing
easier in the promise than in the performance. Mr. Lawrence 
evidently had not the slightest design of rendering
the matter of the explanation an easy one. At breakfast,
he was just as curt as was consistent with good-breeding,
and possibly a little curter, and left the table before any
other member of the family, and was absent all the morning. 
At dinner, he was a suspicion less brief, but more
indifferent and unapproachable even than in the morning;
and Laura, in a miserable, contrite frame of mind, watched
him striding down toward the creek, with a gun over his
shoulder, and Kelpie at his heels. She had not kept her
promise to poor Nattee&mdash;she was as foolish a coward as
Nattee was herself; all this while Lawrence was doing the
girl injustice in his heart, an injustice which she had power
to remove by half a dozen words; and every glance at her
unhappy face added to her remorse. It was too late now,
though; she must wait till he came back from shooting.</p>

<p>A patient afternoon, with Steady at her feet, stumbling

<!-- page 181 -->

through her spelling-lesson, Nattee at her side, learning
with less readiness than usual some new stitch her mistress
fancied, and her own embroidery progressing slowly under
her weary eyes; and then at four o'clock, Laura got up
from her work, and bidding Steady put her book away and
get her cloak and hood, prepared to take the last of the
fast declining sunshine. Steady was an admirable walking
companion, and was to Laura what Kelpie was to Lawrence, 
with the additional advantage of answering in
English when she was spoken to. But only then; and
hour after hour she followed Laura through the woods or
across the fields, or along the windings of the creek, as
silent and as faithful as her master's dog. Laura told her
stories when they were in the house, and taught her faithfully 
all day long; and sometimes when they sat down to
rest under the bridge or on the rocks, she told her about
the mosses and the grasses at their feet, and described the
wonders of the woods at home; but with these exceptions,
she rarely had to talk to Steady, and it was an instance of
the child's good sense and premature intelligence that she
never interrupted, by word or gesture, the thoughtful
silence of her companion, or made herself in any way a
burden or a responsibility. If Laura loitered, she loitered
just a step behind; if Laura hurried at a break-neck pace,
she followed at a pace to match, breathless but uncomplaining.</p>

<p>"Steady, shall we go the High Rocks this afternoon?"
Laura asked, as they went out of the gate.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," Steady answered, and the programme
was settled, and not a word more was spoken for a mile.

<!-- page 182 -->

Very rare and well timed words they must be that harmonize 
with those rare and lovely afternoons in autumn; if
one has a soul, that's the time to let it breathe, to let it
listen to itself and Nature. Companions are all very well
in their way; speech is a noble and a genial gift; but on a
still, clear October afternoon, under the vast, blue, silent
sky, with the quiet fields at one's feet, and among the
unwhispering trees, the faint pulse of the year's completed
life beating slowly, calmly out&mdash;surely repose is the thought
of Nature, silence is the soul's best sanctity.</p>

<p>The path to the High Rocks was rather a devious one,
after they left the lane. Steady had been pilot on the
occasion of their first walk there, and being very much
more at home in the fields than in the highway, and being
economical and thrifty even in her recreations, she had
advised and pursued the "cross lots" policy. It was a
little shorter to be sure, and infinitely pleasanter, but most
people would have gone by the highway. Laura, having
ceased to mind fences and begun to dread people, eschewed
proximity to the road upon principle, and loved beyond
expression the feel of the soft; yielding earth beneath her
feet, and the crisp, dry crushing of the close-mowed grass
lots that they crossed. And where the creek was on the
line of march, and could possibly be followed, it was double
pleasure to keep close to its edges, whatever it led through,
and watch the pictures of the clouds sailing slowly over it,
and the reeds and grasses drooping into it. Through the
Flats, the creek wound still and deep and unruffled, expanding, 
just below the High Rocks, into a miniature lake, then
taking a last farewell to placidity and repose, and with

<!-- page 183 -->

strength gathered from the interval of peace, leaping
swiftly over one obstructing ledge after another, and hurrying 
downward, with narrowed channel but stronger
current, till it approached the river.</p>

<p>The High Rocks that rose precipitately from the little
lake, were crowned with a primeval forest of pine, great
old, majestic trees, that had gazed for centuries at the
verdant Flats and the smooth lake and the sudden tumult of
the waterfall, and had watched generations of wild flowers
bloom and fade about their feet, and had sheltered whole
dynasties of singing birds in their evergreen branches, and
for which dead and dying things they breathed an undying
requiem. And Laura, feeling</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"So young, so strong, so sure of God,"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

so full of life in soul and body, loved to come here when the
day was dying, when the year was dying, and listen to the
slow mass they chanted for the thousand dead days and
dead years they had seen fade into the past. Youth alone
finds fascination in the gloom of Nature; when the decay
has begun within, the signs of decaying life around are
cruel prophets to the soul. The falling of the leaves, the
coming of winter, the earliest snow, that strike a chill
to the heart of age, send a new glow of vigor through the
pulses of youth. They touch no chord of fear within, and
lead to aspirations vague and undefined, but free from
littleness and gloom.</p>

<p>Once among the pines, Laura stopped for the first time
since they had left the farm, and Steady stopped too;
standing back from the precipice her mistress overlooked,

<!-- page 184 -->

panting stealthily, and gazing straight before her. Steady
always looked straight before her; it was the rarest thing
in the world to see her peering about and giving a side-glance 
or a back-glance or any sort of a glance that was not
full, direct, simple and honest. It was impossible to
associate playfulness or coquetry with those great brown
eyes, at once sad and innocent, childish and earnest, with a
shade of unconscious, troubled perplexity in their depths,
that haunted one uncomfortably. "She ought to play with
other children more," thought Laura, as her glance fell
upon her little attendant.</p>

<p>"Steady, why don't you run down into the ravine, and
look at the waterfall? You may play on the rocks below
the fall for half an hour; I shall not be ready to go before
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said the little girl, and docilely went away,
but with so steady and unenthusiastic a gait, that Laura
almost laughed at the idea of having sent her off to play.
No doubt, as she had been sent to do that, she would
obediently play; but what odd playing it would be. Laura
almost longed to follow her and see it.</p>

<p>She had been gone twenty minutes, perhaps, and Laura
had paced up and down the smooth ledge of rock, and
watched the fading of the sunset out of the sky, and
the faint gathering of the twilight, when the silence was
broken by voices subdued by no reverence for the quiet
hour and solemn grove. How clear and careless they were,
too, and after the first moment of surprise, how familiar
one at least was. The talkers soon emerged from the
ravine that led up from the waterfall, Larry, with his gun

<!-- page 185 -->

over his shoulder, and as Laura instantly surmised, Cicily van
Hausen, Caspar's youngest, prettiest daughter by his side.</p>

<p>Cicily bid fair to eclipse her two elder sisters, good-looking 
as they were, one being of the "large, languishing
and lazy" school, but with no capital besides her pink
cheeks and white teeth, and pink cheeks and white teeth
were at a discount in that Dutch neighborhood; and the
other, well-looking enough in her way, was too thrifty and
energetic to be a breaker of hearts. It remained for Cicily,
the third and last, to upset all her sisters' plans, to throw
her steady-going, simple-minded father and mother into
endless perplexities and amazements, and to rule the entire
family with a rod of iron. Her hair was as black as it
ought to have been flaxen, and her eyes, dark, wicked,
coquettish, were totally out of place among her blue-orbed
kith and kin. Her features were not regular, and her skin
was dark; but that was neither here nor there; she was
pretty, and nobody thought of denying it. Her figure,
also, though she was tall and slight, had in itself no particular 
merit, but she unquestionably made the best of it,
carrying it haughtily and well. In this first flush of girlhood, 
she was almost beautiful; but speculative fancy
darted ahead, and wondered at her ugliness when the red
should be faded from the olive, and the roundness should
be shrunken into thinness, and the badness of the soul
should look out from the dark eyes, unveiled of their
coquetry and mirth, and the vindictive mouth should have
forgotten to wreathe itself with smiles and hide its selfishness 
and cunning. She was but just sixteen, just emerging
from awkward adolescence, and Lawrence had but recently

<!-- page 186 -->

begun to notice her and acknowledge her claims to admiration. 
Even the slight admiration of such a coveted
youth, however, had already brought its accompaniment
of envy and ill-will, and Cicily was not backward in using
all honest endeavors to foster both the envy and the admiration. 
It is very possible she may have fancied herself in
love with her admirer, but that was nothing to the purpose; 
he was by far the most desirable match in the country, 
and if she had "hated him with the hate of hell," she
would have conducted the case very much as she conducted
it now.</p>

<p>Even unsuspicious Mrs. Sutherland, seeing with a
mother's keen, apprehensive quickness, the aim of her
clever young neighbor, grew uneasy whenever Lawrence's
evenings were abridged at the fireside, and dreaded the
snares and quicksands under Caspar van Hausen's friendly
roof, even more than the toils and temptations of the
tavern. She had hinted enough of her fears to Laura to
make that young lady perfectly certain whose saucy laugh
it was she heard mixing in such noisy, clashing, merry
music with her cousin's as they came up the ravine.</p>

<p>"That horrid Van Hausen," flashed through her mind,
and her attitude as at that moment they suddenly came
upon her, had much of the wild grace and impotent defiance 
of a startled fawn. She wore her long grey cloak
drooping down to her feet, the hood half fallen from her
face, which had not a tinge of color in it, the golden shade
of her hair had gone with the sunshine; she looked as if
she were made of twilight and autumn evening sky, not a
color or hue of earth about her.</p>

<!-- page 187 -->

<p>What a contrast to the vivid young creation at Larry's
side! The scarlet cloak about her shoulders seemed to
have concentrated the vermilion of the autumn foliage, and
retained its brilliance in the face of the declining daylight;
brown, red, flashing white and glancing black, mixed in
rich-toned picture that the loose hood encircled.</p>

<p>"Laura! You here!" exclaimed Larry, in a tone of
surprise, starting back as they came upon her, then recollecting 
himself, he said: "Cicily, you know my cousin,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," cried Cicily, quite nonchalantly. "We've
seen each other before, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"I have had the honor of being presented to Miss van
Hausen," Laura said, courtesying slightly, while the
younger, nowise abashed, sprang up upon the ledge beside
her, refusing, with confident coquetry, Larry's offer of
assistance, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Why, ain't you afraid of being out so late alone? I
thought I was the only one who didn't mind these lonesome
woods."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, Laura out-Hausens Van Hausen," said
Larry, with an easy laugh, leaning against a tree and resting 
his arms upon his gun. "She don't mind solitude and
darkness; she's only vulnerable on the question of animated 
nature."</p>

<p>"I am not alone," Laura said, quietly, looking at Cicily
and not at Larry.</p>

<p>"Why, who? Your brother?" And Cicily glanced
around with interest, for she longed unutterably to test the
hardness of the young minister's heart.</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>"No; I am waiting for Steady to come up from the falls."</p>

<p>"What, that tiresome little sober-sides? A deal of protection 
she must be, indeed!" exclaimed Cicily, with her
noisy, pretty, sixteen-y laugh.</p>

<p>"I like her very much as a companion," returned Laura,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Yes, upon my word, they're marvellously suited to
each other," cried Larry. "I've often wondered, Laura,
what you would have done if Fate hadn't bestowed that
little maid upon you. Poor Nattee has a tongue, and
sometimes a faint will of her own; she never could have
served you acceptably, besides, she is a slave; but this
demure, dumb, docile little wench presents none of those
objections, and suits you like your shadow. Like mistress,
like maid. Every pretty woman ought to have a maid
that fits her, that's like her, that's becoming to her, just as
she ought to have a gown and a hat that are. Cicily,
Nattee would just fit you; I think I'll have to give her to
you."</p>

<p>"Do," cried Cicily, with dancing eyes; "I promise you
I'd make her good for something if you did! Wouldn't
I break her in!"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt you would," laughed Lawrence. "The
girl's in a fair way of being spoiled where she is; what
with Laura's theoretical commiseration and my mother's
practical compassion, there will be soon nothing worth
giving away left in her. If it weren't for my father's corrective 
influence, she would have been intolerable long
ago, I fancy. She wants a firm, strict hand over her. She
can't bear indulgence."</p>

<!-- page 189 -->

<p>"Now I wish you were in earnest," Cicily said, who, for
a person of sixteen, had a marvellously developed acquisitiveness 
of disposition, and who, moreover, hated work.
"I wish you meant what you said. If you'd only hire us
Nattee low for three or four years, say, I know I could
coax mother into taking her. It would be the best thing
you could do with her; everybody says she's learning
nothing, and that you don't get half the work out of her
you could. You talk to mother about it to-night, see what
she says. Besides," said the girl, with an injured look
at her small hands, "it would be a mercy to get some of
the work off me. Nobody knows how much mother puts
upon me."</p>

<p>"Poor little oppressed!" cried Lawrence, with mock
pity, but with an admiring glance at the small hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, you always laugh at me!" And Cicily turned her
head away with a pout that looked much prettier on her
crimson lips than it does on paper.</p>

<p>"Laugh at you! You'll see how much laughing there
is about me; you'll see if I am not in earnest. Why, I'll
prove to your mother that she's a Goth and a Vandal if
she makes you do anything but braid your hair; I'll make
your father sit in sackcloth and ashes for every batch of
bread he's ever made you put your pretty hands in"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cicily pouted again, but this time with a lurking glimmer 
of dimples. "I don't know who you mean by Goths
and Vandals, but I don't believe they're half as cross as
mother is. I think you <i>might</i> talk to her about it, I
think you'll be a Goth and a&mdash;what's the other? if you
don't."</p>

<!-- page 190 -->

<p>"You shall not have to accuse me of Vandalism, though
Nattee may, perhaps. Cicily, you'll have mercy on the
wench, if you <i>do</i> take her."</p>

<p>Cicily looked spiritedly indignant at this, and appealed to
Laura to know if she did not think he was too impertinent
for anything.</p>

<p>"Am I impertinent? Say, Laura; you ought to know."</p>

<p>A handsomer, more impudent varlet certainly never
lived than Lawrence looked at that moment, as shaking
back the brown curls from his forehead, and leaning idly
forward on his gun, he glanced into his cousin's face, for
the first time since Cicily and he had been talking. Now,
if Laura had been human, she could not have helped resenting 
every other word he had said, and being justly angry at
the total indifference to her presence that the two vivacious
talkers had shown; but she was not human, it was evident,
for her face was as pale and shadowy and quiet as before,
and her voice was shadowy and quiet too, but not a whit
colder than before, nor in any way different from her ordinary 
voice:</p>

<p>"I have not had Miss van Hausen's opportunities of
judging; she knows you better probably than I do."</p>

Cicily, half angry at the delicate sarcasm, and half pleased
at the implied progress she had made toward the acquisition 
of the desired Lawrence, protested against the injustice 
of supposing she knew anything about him, except that
he was the hatefullest tease in the world, and laughed at
her all the while he talked to her. Laura waited politely
for her to finish her very young and very missish protestation, 
and then, with a slight bow that might equally well

<!-- page 191 -->

serve for assent or dissent, she stepped down from the rock
where she stood, and begged they would excuse her, it was
time she called Steady.</p>

<p>"Yes, high time," said Larry, carelessly glancing at the
sky. "You'd better make haste home. It is too late for
you to be out alone."</p>

<p>"Well, then, good night, Miss Sutherland," cried Cicily;
"I hope Steady will take good care of you."</p>

<p>And Lawrence followed her into the path that led over
toward Caspar's farm, while Laura, hurrying down into the
ravine, called Steady in a voice not quite so uncolored as it
had been in the presence of the two who had just left her.
"Yes, ma'am," said Steady from the depths of the ravine,
and the young lady stood still to wait for her. What a
pleasure her face would have been to her cousin just then,
if he had been there to see. How delightfully feminine and
human he would have found the quick passion that overspread 
it; how he would have gloated over the impatience
of her foot upon the rock, the tightening of her hand
against her stomacher. She <i>was</i> angry, the pretty, impassive 
thing, as angry as heart could wish; Lawrence had not
the satisfaction of knowing it, but she was. Cicily van
Hausen he could drive into a passion any hour he pleased;
but her anger was no more like this than a wild September
gale is like a still, deep December snow, shrouding earth,
hiding heaven, choking all life and warmth and hope with
its dumb and muffled power.</p>

<p>What a walk home that was tor Steady! It was so dark
before they left the woods, Laura took her hand to keep her
close to her, and she held it so tight, and walked so fast,

<!-- page 192 -->

the little girl was breathless and scared at the darkness
which she supposed had scared her silent protector. Mrs.
Sutherland was looking out for them anxiously at the door,
and kissed Laura with a look of relief, and said she must
not stay out so late again, particularly when the creek was
so high as it was now, and drew her to the light and said
she looked pale, and in the same breath inquired if she had
seen anything of Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Laura, flushing suddenly, "I saw him in the
woods half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Did he come home with you?" Ralph asked suddenly
from his corner.</p>

<p>"No," said Laura, trying in vain to regain herself; "he
went with Cicily."</p>

<p>Oaths were less startling in Ralph Sutherland's mouth
than in most other persons, owing to their frequent occurrence 
and great familiarity there; but Laura never had become 
fully acclimated; she shrunk away from her uncle's
brutal profanity that evening with a feeling of horror, not
quite, perhaps, as acute as that she experienced on the first
day she listened to it, but with a sensation if possible more
wretched and depressing. The Van Hausen family, to its
remotest branches, incurred his evil wishes, and Cicily, as a
brazen fool, came in for the largest share of his maledictions.
The storm had scarcely subsided, and the family were just
settled at the supper table, when Lawrence entered, looking 
handsomer than ever, after his quick walk in the cold
air, and bringing in with him a rush of freshness and vigor
and spirit, that Laura had failed to derive from her walk, or
Warren from his books. He kept the talk so exclusively 

<!-- page 193 -->

where he wanted it, that even the old man was baffled 
in his attempts to renew the recent philippic, and was
forced to growl menacingly, and turn his back upon the
table, without having injured anybody's comfort further
than his presence inevitably injured it.</p>

<p>Lawrence was in noticeably fine spirits; he talked so well
that even his father listened, and even Warren was roused
to repartee. His fresh, crisp, short sentences had quite a
vigor of their own; Warren could crush them into fragments 
by the subtlety of his thought and the strength of his
reasoning, but still the apparent victory rested with the more
extravagant, <i>prononc&eacute;</i> talker, who never acknowledged defeat 
or the possibility of it, and always kept a laugh ready
to cover a retreat with. That night he fairly cleared the
board, both of opponents and edibles. Warren laughed
and left him at last, after every one else had moved away
from the table, and said he saw Lawrence had to walk a
dozen miles and gorge himself at supper before he could do
justice to an argument; if he had lived a century later, he
would have thrown in a hit about muscular Christianity.</p>

<p>After Warren had gone to his room, and Nattee had
removed the supper, Ralph shambled out into the kitchen
to examine the curing of some hams, and called his wife to
follow him. Laura, who had left the supper table at an
early date, had taken her book and seated herself beside the
fire, and Lawrence, with sumptuous <i>sang-froid</i>, leaned
against the mantel-piece and gazed into the flames. Laura
knew without looking up when the last one left the room;
what could be more hateful than to be left alone with him?
what would she not have given to have been on the other

<!-- page 194 -->

side of the hall door? Unconscious Lawrence, however,
did not seem to notice or to mind it in the least; changed
his attitude carelessly several times, but did not leave the
fire. In a few minutes Nattee came into the room, and
crossed over to put something on the sideboard, and then
went out, but with such a wretched, shrinking, apprehensive 
glance toward Lawrence as she passed him, that Laura's 
heart smote her. Now was the time to speak to Lawrence; 
she was breaking her promise; it was dastardly,
mean; she could not believe it was herself. Such strong
silent pride as hers, however, bends hard, and it was several
minutes before she had it under enough to rise and approach
her cousin.</p>

<p>"Lawrence," she said, "I want to speak to you a moment, 
if you please."</p>

<p>Lawrence turned in some surprise, and said, looking at
her steadily and inquiringly:</p>

<p>"You want to speak to me? Certainly; is there anything 
I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing you can do for me," she returned, so
quickly that it would have seemed almost like throwing his
words back in his face, if so well-bred a person could have
been suspected of so rude an action. "I only want to tell
what I promised Nattee to tell you. It is not my affair at
all; I only speak of it to you to keep my promise."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lawrence, looking down at her critically.
"An excellent reason for speaking, I must admit."</p>

<p>"And, of course, I do not wish to bias you in your judgment 
of her."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>"She is very sorry she was so unfortunate as to vex you
last night, and wants me to tell you how it happened&mdash;and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am listening."</p>

<p>"She says she did not mean to hide away&mdash;she had no
idea of listening&mdash;she&mdash;she"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It was very foolish of her, but she was so afraid you
would be angry because she had not gone to bed, she ran
down into the cellar to&mdash;to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To hide; precisely what you just said she declared she
did not mean to do. Excuse me, Laura, but you have
undertaken a case you're not quite equal to. A little stiff
lying is all that would have got Nattee out of the scrape,
and if you couldn't have gone that length for her, you
should have let it alone&mdash;you should have told her to put
her cause into somebody else's hands."</p>

<p>"I own I should have warned her she had not much to
hope for from her judge."</p>

<p>"Nothing, i' faith, if the office of judge involves the
administration of justice."</p>

<p>"The righteous administration of it involves more
humanity and disinterestedness, to be sure, than I had a
right to look for."</p>

<p>"Ha! my fair Portia, you have outstripped the march
of the case&mdash;you have begun to taunt before the time. You
should have exhausted all the persuasives to mercy before
you began with the invectives. Depend upon it, you are
bungling sadly. Shylock begins to doubt whether you are
a second Daniel."</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>"You seem to have misapprehended me. I did not
begin this conversation for the pleasure of it; I cannot
attempt a contest of wit with you. I only wanted to make
known to you, as shortly as possible, Nattee's excuses and
regrets."</p>

<p>"You must do me the justice to say I have been listening
attentively for them. It's not my fault if I have failed to
get at them."</p>

<p>"I have told you, or would have told you if I had been
allowed, that Nattee is very sorry to have caused you
vexation, and desires nothing so much as forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Very naturally."</p>

<p>"You may look at it as you please, but there is nothing
in the fact of her being in the cellar last night that cannot
be explained."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;explain it then, will you?"</p>

<p>"She loitered a little after the others went up to bed."</p>

<p>"A little? Yes, an hour and a quarter, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I know that was not right, of course."</p>

<p>"A little irregular, it must be confessed."</p>

<p>"But she has always been allowed a great deal of liberty
about that."</p>

<p>"About what has she not been allowed a great deal of
liberty, I should like to ask?"</p>

<p>"And when she heard you coming into the hall"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't like to interrupt you, but I didn't understand
what you said she had been doing in the hall during the
hour and a quarter she spent there before she heard me
coming."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask her&mdash;I don't know what she was doing."</p>

<!-- page 197 -->

<p>"Possibly listening?"</p>

<p>"And, in a foolish fear of being discovered, she hurried
down into the cellar."</p>

<p>"To listen, perhaps, a little longer? But I interrupt
you; pray continue."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to continue about; there is nothing
more for me to tell you, only that she is sorry."</p>

<p>"I think you told me that when you began."</p>

<p>"And I will tell you it again, hoping you can appreciate
the state of mind."</p>

<p>"It is a state of mind we're all apt to be familiar with, I
admit; but somehow its familiarity doesn't seem to have
much bearing on the case in hand."</p>

<p>"Except that it might incline a generous mind to pity."</p>

<p>"Ah! Portia again. But all history and tradition go to
show the Shylocks have not generous minds, and are not
capable of pity. So waiving the quality of mercy altogether, 
you'll do better to appeal to the selfishness inherent
in me. How, pray, shall I gain by restoring this girl to
favor? What probable advantage will it be to me to pass
over her abominable impertinence and deceit?"</p>

<p>"I don't ask you to restore her to favor&mdash;I don't expect
you to forgive her; I am not so wild. I only ask you not
to be cruel in her punishment&mdash;not to vent your anger
wantonly upon her."</p>

<p>Lawrence's face, up to this date, had been only a very
cool and provoking face, but a dark flush of genuine wrath
at these words overspread it, and he bent a very flashing
pair of eyes upon his cousin's.</p>

<p>"Your eloquence has been exerted, then," he said

<!-- page 198 -->

between his teeth, "only to save your favorite from the
lash? You have been trying to shield her from my brutal
rage? You have thought, perhaps, she was in danger of
some punishment that made your blood run cold to think
of; that some scene was brewing to turn you sick with
horror, like that in which my father bore the part I was to
act in this. Yours is a noble, appreciative nature, my
cousin! You humble me with the beauty and greatness
of your soul! It's well worth a man's while to make you
understand him!&mdash;worth any pains to make you know him
for a man and not a brute! Let me tell you in plain language&mdash;let 
me disarm you of your fears. Nattee is quite
safe, as safe as you are, from the effects of my resentment.
She has spent her life in this house, and I think she will tell
you, if she has not forgotten how to speak the truth, she has
never seen me raise my hand to any menial in it. I did not
realize you needed to be told of this. I could not estimate
the narrowness and falseness of your education. Only your
own words could have convinced me of it. My gracious
cousin, know once for all, the paltry refinements of the
home you are languishing for, have little to do with fostering
true manliness of soul; they oftener unmake than make the
gentleman. It is possible for a man who has never touched
the outmost skirts of what you look upon as civilization, to
measure himself with the men within it, and to make them,
and to make the world, acknowledge his equality. I excuse
your misapprehension. You cannot understand me; I am
not written in your language; we shall derive no pleasure
from each other; we have no cousinship of soul. Disabuse
your mind of any fears that have disturbed it; all who can

<!-- page 199 -->

claim womanhood and weakness are safe from my oppression. 
Nattee has nothing to fear from me whatever. You
have nothing to fear from me beyond the necessity which
obliges you daily to see me. You have pleaded your
favorite's cause to so good purpose, you have helped me to
understand your own. Is there anything further I can
explain or promise for your satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing further," said Laura, in a low voice, as,
very pale, she hurried from the room.</p>

But their prayers are all in vain&mdash;<br/>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">There's</span> something to help you through this rainy day,
my wench," said Ralph, with unprecedented civility, throwing 
a package of letters on the table as he passed through
the sitting-room to change his wet clothes. It had been a
rainy day of the most unequivocal kind, a pelting, pouring,
pitiless storm, that no man but Ralph, and no beast but
Dirck, had thought of braving. The farm hands had been
lounging in the barn in inglorious inactivity, endeavoring
to fill up the vacuity of life with shelling corn, weaving
baskets, mending nets; but withal, it was neither work nor
play, and the day had been a long one.</p>

<p>In the house it was very different. To working womankind 
Nature brings no holidays; storms without but
redouble the work within; heat, cold, feast days and fast
days, the household drudge's weariness is but a question of
degree; the same mean things to be done over and over
and over again, the same tiresome trifles to be remembered,
the same weary burden to be carried. The drudge or

<!-- page 201 -->

drudges of a household should always be as free from mind
as possible. It has long been a question with intelligent
persons, whether some useful domestic animal, answering
to that name, in the melee that followed the debarkation
from the ark, did not stray away from its fellows, and become 
lost forever to humanity. There are indubitable traces
of the existence of such an element in the well-being and
long living of the antediluvian families; and the deep-seated
want of something that can work forever and not mind, is
felt in every household capable of feeling. Some higher
order of beast, something between a beaver and a woman;
think what it would have been. How it might have been
driven without compunction: how it might have baked and
brewed, mended stockings, marked clothes, counted linen,
cleaned house, settled closets, been on its legs from morn to
dewy eve, and given no superior being a twinge of conscience 
in the beholding. What generations of pale,
dragged mothers it would have rescued, what scores of
overworked sisters it would have saved! Benefactors of
the race, in bending their efforts to the recovering of this
lost animal, would do more for the advancement of human
happiness than they are in the habit of doing in the prosecution 
of their favorite projects.</p>

<p>"Aunt Andria, do sit down!" pleaded Laura for the
dozenth time, as her aunt passed wearily through the room
on her way to the store-room, followed by Nattee with
a trayful of sweetmeat jars, just freshly labelled and
tied up.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my dear, in a little while," returned her aunt,
with a pale smile. She had commenced promising it early

<!-- page 202 -->

in the morning, and it was now four o'clock, and Laura had
arrived at the conclusion that as nothing but night would
put a stop to household wants, the sooner it came the
better. The amount of work that had gone on within that
house in those ten hours was wonderful, passing belief.
Dairy-work, chamber-work, kitchen-work, and all done at
disadvantage on account of the storm. There had been
baking, ironing, cooking; Salome was "thundering" cross,
and Nattee was "apt to lose her head;" Steady was slow,
and Laura was inexperienced; and upon the poor mother
had come a weight of actual work and intangible worry
that was just as surely breaking her down as the comfort it
insured was building up and pampering those who formed
her household.</p>

<p>Laura had tried to do her duty faithfully all the morning,
had beaten eggs till she nearly fainted, had tortured her
unaccustomed fingers with the ladle and the butter-bowl,
and only had succeeded in convincing herself that she was
a worthless and superfluous creation, and had made her
aunt miserable at the sight of her fatigue. The kind lady
had a vague feeling that Laura was only made to be waited
on and to look pretty; she thought nothing that their house
afforded half grand or good enough for her, and never
dreamed that she was doing anything extravagant and
uncalled for when she waited on her with her own hands
and studied anxiously to anticipate her wishes and enhance
her comfort. The finest linen in the press went weekly on
Laura's bed, the best dimity curtains graced her room;
its old, swallow-haunted chimney was startled with the
unheard-of luxury of a daily fire; in short, there was

<!-- page 203 -->

nothing left undone to show the love and reverence in
which the young guest was held.</p>

<p>And the burden of this honor was wearily oppressing the
young guest. She was bitterly humbled at the sight of her
own uselessness and inexperience, and longed beyond
expression to redeem herself from the character of fine-ladyism 
which she knew she must be bearing. It had
become her high ambition lately to distinguish herself as a
good housewife, but everything seemed to have conspired
to thwart her of its gratification, and she was thinking
gloomily that afternoon, as she sat by the window watching 
the storm and neglecting her embroidery; "it's no
wonder they all look down upon me. I cannot do anything. 
I don't see why they never taught me anything
when I was at home. That Cicily van Hausen, with her
red cheeks, knows twice as much as I do! Even Salome
treats me like a child; my aunt thinks I can't be trusted to
make a pudding by myself; Lawrence despises me; my
uncle only doesn't because I am not worthy of his notice.
I am nothing but a burden and a trouble in the house!"</p>

<p>The time of the arrival of the letters was four o'clock.
Warren had brought his books downstairs, Lawrence had
just that moment come in from the barn, and was drying
his wet boots before the blaze. He did not look up when
his father threw the package of letters on the table, but
Warren did, and a faint color came into his face.</p>

<p>"Well, Laura, I suppose you're very happy," he said,
quietly getting up and going to the table.</p>

<p>Laura did not look very supremely happy, however, or
very much excited as she put out her hand for her letter.

<!-- page 204 -->

She broke the seal and commenced it with a slightly knit
brow, which did not relax during the reading. It began:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Laura</span>: "We all think it was very strange
you went away without telling us good bye, and Frances
says I am very foolish for writing you a letter. But I am
sure you will be interested to hear I am going to be
married in the spring&mdash;it is decided at last; my dear
Adolphe declares it is cruel to put him off any longer, and
swears he will not wait another year. He has conscientious
scruples about eloping, or (I may say to you in confidence)
we should have been married long ago. It is nothing but
Charles' ugliness about the settlement that has kept us in
this state; but now he promises to attend to it before
spring, and make it all satisfactory. I suppose it is being
engaged himself makes him better-natured about it. People 
are always a little softer then, Frances says.</p>

<p>"Were you surprised to hear of the engagement? They
are to be married on the first of November, you know. It
will make a great change for us, but Frances cares more
about it than I do, I think. Did I tell you Adolphe met us
at Brussels, last month, and afterwards went up the Rhine
with us? Oh, what a sweet time we had! I never enjoyed
a journey so much in my life. I cannot tell you how many
funny things happened. I was the only one of the party,
except Adolphe, who spoke decent German. You ought to
have heard Charles! Adolphe says my pronunciation is
really surprising for a foreigner. I hope we shall go abroad
as soon as we are married.</p>

<p>"Frances sends her love to you. She is busy preparing

<!-- page 205 -->

the house for its new mistress. You'd hardly know the
drawing-room&mdash;it's really grand. Charles' own rooms are
all refurnished in such beautiful taste; and the little study,
where we've spent so many happy hours over our French,
is done in pink and gold, and turned into a morning room
for my lady. I often ask Adolphe if it is not strange that
people can care for such things when they are rejoicing in a
first and absorbing affection. I wish you were to be here
for the wedding&mdash;it will be a very grand affair: very different 
from what mine is to be, though. I am sure you would
rather be here for mine. I wish Warren were here to perform 
the ceremony. I can't bear this tiresome Dr. Drawl.
He is staying with us now, and Frances declares she'd
rather have an elephant in the house. He is always in the
way, and is sure to block up just the door you want to pass
through, and is so heavy and slow he never gets out of the
way till you've got over wanting to go by him. Would
you believe it, he hasn't sense enough to leave Adolphe and
me by ourselves, but comes up and joins us wherever he
finds us, and is very disagreeable. I must not make my
letter any longer now. I forgot to ask you how you like
America? Do you have a piano at your uncle's? You are
living with your uncle, are you not? You must write me
all about it.</p>

<p>"I suppose Georgy has written to you; she has been so
much occupied when I have seen her, lately, I have forgotten 
to ask her. I think she's very different since the recent
change in her circumstances; but, as Adolphe says, that's
all very natural. I am sure I should never have let it make
any difference in my feelings toward her, neither would

<!-- page 206 -->

Frances; but she don't seem to feel the same, and I'm sure
I can't help it. Wait till you have a lover, my dear, and
you'll see how little you care for other people. Good-bye.</p>

<p>"I am your ever affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Ellinor</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>"How unlovely love makes people!" thought Laura, as
she laid down her ever affectionate friend Ellinor's letter,
chilled through with its selfishness and folly. "Georgy&mdash;Ellinor&mdash;it 
seems as if they were all dead. Oh, how weary
it is! How lost home seems to me now!"</p>

<p>"Laura, will you exchange with me?" said Warren,
giving her his letters, and putting out his hand for hers.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I can't," murmured Laura, involuntarily drawing 
it back. It was so cruel to give that letter to Warren
to read; every line of it would be a stab to him. And yet,
he must know&mdash;there was no use in keeping it back; he
was prepared, she was sure; and conquering her reluctance, 
she gave it to him.</p>

<p>The interest of the letters he had handed her was not so
absorbing that she forgot to watch him while he read it.
He read it through the first time hurriedly and hungrily,
then again with a slow, determined mastery of the woe it
dealt. His was not a face given to abrupt and apparent
changes; it had a language, but it was a classical and silent
one, "not understanded of the people." The assembled
family might have been around the fireside, with greedy eyes
fixed on his face, that dull rainy twilight, and have seen no
more on it, with all the help of the wide blazing fire, than
weariness and quiet.</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>But Laura saw more: she saw the slow death of the long
dying hope, the cruel certainty that had sealed the secretly
cherished uncertainty. There was no struggle, no rebellion&mdash;it 
was too late for that; but it was the utter extinction
of life&mdash;the patient descending into the dull grey sepulchre
of his earthly hopes, in which he must wait for years, perhaps, 
till the rising of his heavenly hopes; the falling of a
gloomy night which had the promise of no dawn,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Till from the east the eternal morning moved."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>It was long before Laura, watching him secretly, with
tender, pitying eyes, dared break his rigid revery. Stealing 
to his side, she passed her arm around his neck, and said
softly, hardly knowing what she said, simply longing to
make him speak to her:</p>

<p>"Did you read the letter? Ellinor seemed very happy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Laura," he said, putting his hand on hers, and
looking up at her with a sweet, patient smile; "they all
seem very happy."</p>

<p>Laura could not speak&mdash;that smile hurt her like a knife;
she leaned her head down on his, and caressed the hand
she held, with that speechless sort of sympathy that sometimes 
goes straightest to the source of pain.</p>

<p>"Is it not strange, Laura," he said, after a moment, in a
low, musing voice, "that while God's love for us, and care
over us, is the one only thing of which, in this uncertain
world, we can be certain, it should yet be the thing hardest
to be kept in mind&mdash;the thing hardest to be believed? It
is well we are not left to choose our own discipline; we
should choose very differently from God, I am afraid. But

<!-- page 208 -->

He remembers whereof we are made&mdash;He accepts our submission, 
even though He wrings it from us. My sweet sister, 
we have a more merciful Lord than we deserve."</p>

<p>Long after, Warren thanked God he had had strength to
say so then; that he had remembered, even at that dark
moment, that the last wave of desolation had not swept
over him&mdash;that he was not parted from all earthly love,
while Laura's hand clasped his, and Laura's true heart beat
against his own.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span> soon found that though Nattee might not have
anything to fear from her cousin's resentment, she herself
had. She began to realize what a man's resentment might
be; his cold avoidance of her, the sternness of his voice
and face whenever he was obliged to address her, the
control he put upon himself not to make his change of
manner toward her noticeable to others, made her heartily
penitent for the share she had had in producing that
change. She began to realize the difference between a
tantalizing, half-feigned petulance, and a strong, deep-rooted 
anger, and to wish heartily for the restoration of
the former, little as she had seemed to like it.</p>

<p>Two or three evenings in the week, his mother was made
entirely wretched by his absence; no one asked where
they were spent, but no one doubted, it was at Caspar
van Hausen's. A stormy scene had occurred between
him and his father, one night after his return, which
seemed but to have strengthened the one in his perversity,
and the other in his opposition. A little obstruction often
puts the whole machinery of a household out of tune; this
little escapade of Nattee's seemed to have deranged things

<!-- page 210 -->

so, it looked as if order and harmony had taken their
eternal flight from that locality. Ralph was black as a
thunder-cloud&mdash;not partaking at all of the transitory nature
of that phenomenon, however, but lowering perpetually
in the domestic horizon; poor Mrs. Sutherland looked pale
and depressed. Laura felt everybody's discomfort, multiplied 
by ten, added to her own vexation. Warren
thought Laura out of spirits, and was disturbed accordingly. 
Steady was her mistress' shadow, and felt its darkening. 
Nattee cried her eyes out in secret, and blundered
and fluttered in public; while the high-handed young
tyrant, the withdrawal of whose smiles caused all this
eclipse, at home looked lordly and nonchalant to an insupportable 
degree, and shone with added lustre at the Van
Hausen hearthstone.</p>

<p>One windy evening, about a fortnight after the commencement 
of this state of things, immediately upon the
clearing away of supper, Lawrence, as usual, got up from
his chair, and after loitering a little by the fire, reached
down his pipe and tobacco-box, filled and lit the pipe,
buttoned his coat tight across his chest, and turned to
leave the room. The family were assembled around the
fire, and Laura looked with apprehension when she saw
Mrs. Sutherland follow him to the door.</p>

<p>"You're not going out again to-night, Larry?" she said
uneasily, laying her hand timidly on his arm.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, ma'am, I'd thought of it," he returned, stopping, 
but looking quite unmoved.</p>

<p>"Why do you&mdash;I mean&mdash;can't you&mdash;don't you think
it would be pleasanter to stay at home just this once?"</p>

<!-- page 211 -->

<p>"I hadn't thought so, ma'am, I acknowledge."</p>

<p>"I wish, my son"&mdash;&mdash; she began, and then stopped.</p>

<p>"Come, Larry," said Warren, laying aside his book and
getting up. "Come, make an exception in our favor to-night. 
Stay home and have a game of whist. I have not
played a rubber since I came to America."</p>

<p>Laura looked in admiration, for she knew that Warren
hated cards, and that in old times there had been no more
dreaded penance for him than to be called from his book to
make up a table in default of any more enthusiastic player.
The Rector had loved his game of whist with a truly
pastoral affection, and it had held a place in his evening
as undisputed as his nap or his cup of tea. Warren and
Laura had been early instructed in the doctrines set forth
by Hoyle, and relished their practice about as much as
they did the rendering of their Latin themes, and the
writing of their first French exercises. Warren's proposal,
therefore, Laura looked upon as a wonderful instance of
self-sacrifice, but quite in character with his habitual,
unostentatious renunciation of every personal comfort and
pleasure. Some pious men make an example to their
other lusts of some one favorite, and go on crucifying it
alone, and remunerating themselves by a half grumbling
indulgence of the others all their days; but Warren's self-denial 
was the habit of his mind, the uppermost thought,
so constant that it had ceased to be a thought and grown
to be an impulse; so habitual, that his own gratification
came, if it came at all, only as an afterthought; so
thorough, that he hardly had a wish.</p>

<p>His aunt gave him a grateful look, and said beseechingly:</p>

<!-- page 212 -->

<p>"Do stay, Larry, my son. It would be so pleasant to
have a game!"</p>

<p>"Why mother," he cried, half impatiently, "I didn't
know you cared for cards. It's a new entertainment for
you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she cares to see the rest of us entertained,"
said Warren. "Come, Larry, don't be a perverse."</p>

<p>"You can play without me, good people, just as well as
with me. I know I shall not add much to your entertainment."</p>

<p>"I don't think it probable you will, but still we cannot
play without you, such is the importance you derive from
the fact of the existence of but three whist-players in the
house. Aunt Andria does not play, and there are only
Uncle Ralph, Laura and myself. It remains to be seen
whether three people shall be deprived of an evening's
entertainment solely on account of the selfish disposition
of the fourth. Oh, most hard-hearted, it shall not be.
You shall stay; put down that pipe, and resume your
seat."</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" cried Lawrence, half impatient
and half amused, as he reluctantly relinquished his pipe,
and approached the chair his mother placed for him.</p>

<p>"Laura, find the cards, will you?" said her brother.
"Uncle, are you not coming to the table?"</p>

<p>Ralph was very well pleased with the arrangement, but
true to his principles of opposition, growled, and raised a
dozen objections, before he hitched his chair over to the
card table, and took up one of the packs Laura laid on it.</p>

<p>"How shall we arrange ourselves?" said Warren.</p>

<!-- page 213 -->

<p>"Father, cut, if you please," said Lawrence, quickly
handing him a pack.</p>

<p>The cards were perverse, however, and sentenced him to
Laura, and she felt her cheeks burn at the involuntary
compression of his lips as he took his place at the table.
His temper, however, was destined to a further trial. All
that a young lady could do in the way of trumping her
partner's tricks, returning her adversary's leads, forgetting
what cards were out, and being generally aggravating,
Laura did that night.</p>

<p>"Why, Laura, I never saw you play so badly!" Warren
said, after one horrible mistake.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, Warren," she said, ready to cry, and
immediately making one much worse.</p>

<p>Whist being a game which, for anything like success,
requires the most collected state of the female mind, was
naturally a failure in Laura's case; for besides having a
silent, aggravated, and bitterly polite partner, she harbored
a morbid dread of putting her uncle in a passion, and
making Warren ashamed of her. Warren played an
irreproachable game; so well-trained and clear a mind as
his, of course could not fail to master anything of the
kind he undertook, and Ralph smacked his lips with fat
satisfaction as he watched the development of his plans.
Lawrence played well too, not perhaps so scientifically and
thoughtfully as his cousin, but with equal clearness and
boldness, and as the game advanced, the three men began
to feel an interest in it, that two at least had lacked
at the outset. Lawrence had the disinclination to be
outdone, common to persons of his temperament, and

<!-- page 214 -->

was concentrating his mind upon what he was about, and,
by the help of tolerable cards, was keeping up against
pretty heavy odds, when the following most trying circumstance 
occurred:</p>

<p>A run of rather poor cards had kept down the grasping
ambition of Warren and his uncle for the last two hands,
and their opponents (though Laura hardly deserved the
name) only needed the odd trick to put them out. Laura
had had a short suit of diamonds, which Lawrence had led
her twice, and which she had, very respectably, trumped.
But the third time round, knowing from the state of his
own finances, that it could not possibly pass both adversaries 
again, and feeling in the keenest manner all that
hung upon the winning or losing of that card, Lawrence
said involuntarily, "Look out, Laura, what you do." And
Laura, thrown into utter confusion and bewilderment by
her desire to comply with his request, looked out most
effectually, and played the lowest trump in her hand.</p>

<p>"You little fool!" chuckled Ralph, as he put his queen
upon it with saturnine satisfaction; while her brother said,
"Laura!" wonderingly, and Lawrence, with compressed
lips, exclaimed: "That settles it; you have the card," and
threw his down upon the table. While Laura's dropped
into her lap, and covering her face with her hands&mdash;she
burst into tears. The fact was, she had been bothered, and
frightened, and intent, and had her mind upon the stretch
for the last hour, and this climax had called for a self-control 
beyond her present powers.</p>

<p>"Laura, don't be foolish," said her brother, quietly,
laying his hand upon her arm, and preventing her retreat. 

<!-- page 215 -->

"Do you desire another game, sir, or are you
tired?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Ralph, "give 'em another beating;
they'll be the better for it. Here, it's my deal; cut for me,
Lawrence."</p>

<p>Laura had made a violent effort to recover herself and
had succeeded so far as to take up her cards and assort
them in rather an unsystematic way, when a loud knock
thundered from the front door, and an accompanying
emphatic clearing of the throat, heralded the advent of
some strong-lunged visitor.</p>

<p>"Pertinax, as I'm a sinner!" cried Larry, laying down
his cards to listen. "I should know that 'hem' if I heard
it in Jerusalem. Warren, you're a lost man if he catches you
at the card-table! He'll preach you into ribbons; he won't
leave you a shred of reputation to go home in; he'll ruin
you, my poor boy&mdash;fly, if you value your good name:
throw down your cards, if you have any mercy on yourself!
Why, what's the matter with the man? I vow he's so
scared he can't move! Look at him!"</p>

<p>"You're half right," said Warren, with a smile. "I am
in a sufficiently awkward predicament, I must confess; it's
lucky I don't want to run, for I could not get very far!
You needn't give me any credit for standing my ground,
for I haven't strength to get away from it!"</p>

"I haven't seen father look so pleased in a year," said
Lawrence, laughing, as Nattee went to the door. "Warren, 
I know you wish you could go through to China, but
meet your fate like a man, my good fellow!"</p>

<p>"Lawrence, do be careful, my son," murmured Mrs.

<!-- page 216 -->

Sutherland, anxiously, as a great rush of cold air from the
hall announced that the door had been opened.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> careful, mother; I'd have put the cards under the
table if I hadn't been prevented."</p>

<p>"At least we will not disedify Mr. Pound, by going on
with our game," said Warren. "Put down your cards,
Laura. You are released."</p>

<p>"Put down your own," whispered Larry, as the guest
made his appearance at the door. But Warren evidently
had no intention of putting them down; he kept them
rather ostentatiously in his hand as he rose and advanced to
meet the new-comer. It required all his self-command,
however, to keep a perfectly unmoved face and easy manner 
as he encountered the astounded Puritan. Entirely
unrestrained by the shackles that encumber people in polite
society, Mr. Pound experienced no compunction in letting
his horror and astonishment sit openly upon his expressive
face. Silent rebuke formed no part either of his vigorous
creed; he would have esteemed himself shamefully derelict
in his duty, if he had ever held his tongue at the sight of
any of his neighbors' sins. He seemed to hold himself personally 
responsible for all the evil that was done upon the
earth, and went at its chastisement as if the entire
annihilation of it by his hand were his only chance of
escaping eternal damnation. It seemed to be his solemn
conviction that he held a special commission from the court
of heaven to pitch into everybody; no churchman vowed
to belief in the Apostolic succession, ever proclaimed or felt
a more towering apprehension of the importance of his
office. With this difference, though, that the arrogant

<!-- page 217 -->

churchman, however fond of power, acknowledged that it
had a bound, as far as temporalities went, while the
Reverend Pertinax thundered alike at Jew and Gentile,
friend and foe, the dweller in his own parish, and the
dweller in his neighbor's parish. It becomes rather a
dangerous thing in a community, when a member of it
clothes himself at will with such unlimited powers; Mother
Church, assuming as she is regarded in other cases, is
rather a safeguard in this. The world has circled round
her for many ages in spasmodic expansions of thought and
uncertain rushes of spiritual advancement and philosophic
progress; but the wave that beats about her base to-day,
is little different from the wave that dashed itself into foam
upon her firm foundation hundreds of years ago; "she is
founded upon a rock, but is planted in the sea." The light
she lifts on high and that streams so steadily now across
the tumbling waters, has sometimes flickered and wavered
and burned low, but the death of time alone shall witness
its extinction; "the sacred, high, eternal noon" of glory
alone shall quench its faithful flame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutherland followed anxiously in Warren's wake,
and tried to make the visitor welcome, but he entirely
refused to be made welcome, merely waving his hand
in acknowledgment of her civility, and flashing his eyes
about the room in a very scathing manner.</p>

<p>"It is a very windy night," said Warren, anxious to
break the oppressive pause that had followed his aunt's
meek hospitality. "You must have had a cold walk across
the Flats. Will you not come to the fire?"</p>

<p>Still no answer, and a dreadful glare at the card-table.</p>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p>"Well, but won't you sit down anyhow, Mr. Pound?"
cried Larry, putting a chair so very near him, he could
hardly help sitting down.</p>

<p>"No, young man," he said, in an awful voice (joking
apart, it <i>was</i> awful, for there was a tremendous power in
the man's sincerity of purpose and entire faith in himself).
"No, young man, I'll not sit down till I have spoke my
mind. I'll not sit down among gamblers and breakers of
the law, without tellin' 'em the message the Lord sends 'em
by my mouth. I should be a careless watchman if I didn't
warn 'em; I should be a wicked shepherd if I let the
sheep wander off into all sorts o' wildernesses, and didn't
strive to bring 'em back."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said Warren; "but don't you agree
with me, it is only in your own station you are to sound the
trumpet, only your own flock you are responsible for?
Think what confusion would arise, my good friend, if every
watchman's eyes were fixed upon the distant towers of the
adjacent cities, when he was only set to guard his own&mdash;if
every shepherd left his own sheep, and went to oversee his
neighbor's flock."</p>

<p>"Aye," said the heretical parson, stoutly; "but in the
Lord's vineyard there are no such distinctions&mdash;there is no
mine and thine&mdash;we all do the Lord's work, in the Lord's
strength, and in the Lord's time, just when He sends us
to do it."</p>

<p>"In a word, then," said Warren, "Heaven's first law is
outraged on earth by God's appointment? Law and order
are necessary for the heavenly hosts, but are superfluous
among the children of men!"</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>"The word of the Lord is not bound," said the Reverend 
Pertinax, shaking his head. "He can save by many
or by few. He doesn't need the ordinances of man.
There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body; the
natural body, it is the corruptible church you swear by;
the spiritual body, it is the Lord's people everywhere, of
all kindred and peoples and tongues scattered abroad upon
the face of the earth."</p>

<p>A slight expression of pain contracted Warren's face;
the sacred words that never crossed his lips without a
reverent humbling of heart and voice, struck him almost
with horror, coming from the hard-voiced, uncompromising
dogmatical preacher. With the promiscuous mixing up of
Holy Writ and unholy prejudices, the liberal twisting of
scriptural language to secular application, he had been
entirely unacquainted till he had made Mr. Pound's
acquaintance, and that acquaintance had not been as yet
sufficiently familiar to wear off the edge of his discomfort.
Warren had still a great deal to unlearn, a great deal of
reverence and refinement to get rid of, before he could
meet his opponent on equal ground. To stand there, leaning 
against the card-table, with Laura listening, with
Larry's laughing eyes upon him, knowing his uncle's
brutal pleasure, openly expressed, in seeing the Christians
fight, was a trial quite beyond even his powers of endurance.</p>

<p>"At any rate, we'll make a compromise, Mr. Pound," he
said, with a smile of indestructible good breeding. "If you
will not acknowledge I have a right to set my parishioners
an example of which you disapprove, at least you will

<!-- page 220 -->

accept my apologies for having offended your conscience,
and my assurances that I did it unwittingly."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose," said the preacher, somewhat mollified,
as Warren collected the cards, and putting them into the
drawer of the table, pushed it back, "I don't suppose
you did it with an evil mind; you are as one that gropeth
for the wall, and as one that stumbleth at noonday and
hath no light. Your church hath blinded your eyes to the
truth; therefore, as it was not your willful error, I have
spoken."</p>

<p>"I am sure I appreciate your kindness," Warren said,
with such a sweet-temperedness that Pertinax melted down
into the chair he placed for him without a murmur, and the
family subsided into their seats.</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if I do, though," growled Ralph, indignant
at the pacific tone the conversation threatened to take, and
exasperated at once by the loss of the fight and the interruption 
of the game.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear uncle, please!" murmured Laura earnestly,
leaning over his chair and touching his lips with her cool,
soft hand, "don't say anything about the cards; it will
distress Warren so extremely&mdash;it will make him so uncomfortable."</p>

<p>The old man looked at her for a moment without
speaking; perhaps there was something in the unusual
touch of a woman's hand upon his hard and ugly lips, that
sealed them for the moment; perhaps there was something
in the control he seemed recently to have put upon himself
in regard to Warren and Laura; at all events, with an oath
uttered so low, even Laura did not catch its full profanity,

<!-- page 221 -->

he sank back in his chair and made no further protest in
the matter of the cards.</p>

<p>But the earnest-minded parson could not let them drop;
he had not had his say, his conscience or his loquacity were
still unsatisfied. Lawrence, who admired his cousin infinitely, 
watched with great enjoyment his quiet, well-bred
endurance of the guest's impertinences, his simple refutations 
of the charges he advanced, his startling clearness and
perspicuity when he was driven to defend his cause. No
one could say, when at last the argument wore itself out
and sank down into its own embers, that Warren had not
had the best of it; even Pertinax's stoutest champion
would have had to own he had suffered considerable damage
at his adversary's hands. Warren had been used to dealing
with much more practised intellects than Pertinax had ever
had the advantage of encountering, and all that training
could do for him had been done. When it came to the
handling of such a question as this, as a simple matter of
argument, Pertinax was "nowhere." Warren could out-think 
him any day, though perhaps he could not have
out-lived him nor out-preached him. The crowning glory
of his triumph on this occasion was, however, that at the
close of the engagement, he set his adversary on his feet
again, and made him half uncertain who was victor, and
soothed him into a temporary oblivion of his sprains and
scratches.</p>

<p>This, however, had but just been effected, and some
inoffensive and unexciting subject brought under discussion,
when the tall clock in the corner bawled out "Nine!" and
threw Warren into a new perplexity. About a week

<!-- page 222 -->

before, he had obtained with infinite effort the consent of
his uncle to the regular reading of family prayers in the
household, and though at the striking of nine and the
entrance of the servants, he always shambled off to bed
with a most disedifying and ostentatious scorn of the proceedings, 
his nephew was not in the least disheartened by
it, nor indeed did it seem to have much effect upon any one
who witnessed it. Warren could not help thinking his
uncle's disapprobation tended rather to prejudice the slaves
in favor of, than against the service; at any rate, they were
attentive and well-behaved, and trooped into the sitting-room 
with great punctuality and grave decorum at the
striking of nine o'clock.</p>

<p>On this ill-starred night, the last syllable of the announcement 
had not died upon the air, before Warren's anxious
ear caught the shoving back of the kitchen chairs and the
clumping of Rube's heavy shoes across the kitchen floor.
There remained now no hope that the reverend gentleman
would leave the field; indeed, nothing remained for
Warren but to do his duty, and probably give him mortal
offence. He had heard enough of the spiritual etiquette of
Methodism to know he was expected to ask his visitor to
make a prayer, and probably to select and read "the chapter." 
Now, though Warren had no doubt, in his humble
heart, that his visitor's prayers were just as acceptable to
Heaven as his own, as far as their individual piety could
make them acceptable, he had no doubt, either, that he
would be committing a sin in permitting him to officiate in
his stead&mdash;a sin quite as heinous in his eyes as the sin of
card-playing was in his brother's eyes. Apart from the

<!-- page 223 -->

probability of his profiting by the opportunity to thrust
some wild and unsettling doctrine into his petition, if he had
been permitted to make it, Warren's strait-laced interpretation 
of his creed forbade such an encouragement of
heretical intrusion; he ached at the bare idea of giving
pain and causing misapprehension, but he did not harbor
the least idea of doing evil that good might come.</p>

<p>When old Ralph had gathered up his shoes and his vest
and his candle, he walked over to the door, then pausing
before he opened it, and glancing back upon the quietly
assembled servants and apparently devout circle around the
fire, he said, with a most unprepossessing laugh, "You've
been doing some pretty hard fightin', and now I suppose
you're going to do some pretty hard prayin'; but I doubt
whether the prayin''ll be as much to your liking as the
fightin' was. It takes you Christians to maul each other!"</p>

<p>As the door closed upon his ugly face, a moment's silence
fell, as Warren, a thought paler than usual, shaded his eyes
from the light and bent over the great Bible, open on the
table; then, in the beautiful voice that suppressed feeling
only made more beautiful, he began that sublime Thirteenth
of First Corinthians. It was the Evening Lesson, but if he
had had all the books of the old and new Dispensation to
choose from, he could have chosen none more fitted for the
evening's trial. No sermon more impressive was ever
preached than those thirteen verses; into every heart the
wonderful voice that read carried the wonderful words of
inspiration, with the magnetic force of faith and feeling.
And when they rose from their knees, and the impressed
and quiet servants left the room, the great-hearted old

<!-- page 224 -->

Methodist laid his rough hand in Warren's delicate palm,
and said with a somewhat husky and unsteady voice: "We
get our religion out o' the same book, if we don't go the
same way to get it; and I'm thinkin', the same Lord is rich
in mercy to all them that call upon Him, whatever words
they take to call upon Him with. He can hear you when
you pray to Him in the words He's given to your church,
and He can hear me when I pray to Him in the words He's
put into my heart. An' it seems to me, we'd be shaming
the Lord we both believe in, an' shortenin' His arm, if we
couldn't trust Him to bring both out right, an' to make us
work His will, just as He wants to have it worked, without
quarrellin' wi' each other about the way it's to be done.
We ain't much after all, my brother; we may know a good
deal as far as men can see, but we're cryin', crawlin' babies
in the sight o' God&mdash;we're so near to nothing, we'll die
with shame when the Great Day comes, if we've been
countin' on ourselves. Maybe I'm right, and maybe you're
right, and maybe we're both wrong; God knows. We
won't quarrel. He can see through an' through us; let us
spend what time we've got to spare from workin' in praisin'
Him, not in pickin' at each other. The best merit that
we've either of us got, is that we're servin' Him; and we
ar'n't servin' Him when we're livin' in malice an' envy, hateful 
an' hatin' one another. I'm willin' to leave all our
differences to the Lord to settle, an' hold myself your friend
an' brother while I'm in the flesh."</p>

<p>"God knows," said Warren, as he grasped his hand,
"my heart is not so narrow as ever to distrust you, and
yours is great enough never to misapprehend me. When

<!-- page 225 -->

my duty leads me to oppose your teaching, you will know
it is the creed I cannot sanction, not the man I cannot
reverence. When my church forbids my joining with your
worship, you will know it is not that I doubt the holiness
and fervor that animates it. We will, as you have said,
put all our differences of creed into God's gracious hands,
and serve Him in simplicity of faith and in charity of feeling. 
You have spent your life in a service which I have
but just begun; you have a claim upon my reverence and
affection, and all but my allegiance, and I have a claim
to your forbearance and your gentle judgment of all the
rashnesses and inconsistencies my youth may lead me into.
Whatever comes, believe me, I hold you in high regard and
honor, and hope to prove to you by my life, if I cannot by
my words, that we have a common faith and serve a
common Master."</p>

<p>"We understand each other, then," he answered, turning
away and going toward the door. "We'll keep this in our
minds against our next temptation." And without another
word, or a single salutation, the strange old man was
gone.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the eve of All Saints&mdash;a sweet, still Indian
summer afternoon&mdash;and Laura and Warren, having just
completed the pious work that had occupied their hearts
and hands so many weeks, turned the key of the chapel
door, and turned toward home. Warren walked forward
slowly and thoughtfully as was his wont, but Laura, as was
her wont, found something beautiful and admirable in every
step, and was constantly calling to her brother to stop and
share her younger and more demonstrative enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"It's so seldom," she cried, reproachfully, "that you
walk with me, I think it is unkind, when you do, that you
cannot remember I am with you, and enjoy the things that
I admire."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, stopping, and trying to look interested,
but only succeeding in looking very patient and affectionate, 
"Well, what am I to admire? I am sure I am ready
to enjoy anything you want me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but that's so cold and mannish; you have no
enthusiasm. I am sure you did not use to be so. You

<!-- page 227 -->

used to see things of yourself, and didn't need to have them
pointed out to you. Why, often in the woods at home, do
you remember? you and Georgy used to say, you did not
think I had a soul, I was so quiet. A view like that, <i>then</i>,
would have made you eloquent.&mdash;&mdash;Ah! what have I done!"
she thought, a moment after, glancing at his face.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, laying his hand on hers, and
looking at her with most sad eyes, "Forgive me, if I disappoint 
you. The world is not beautiful to me any longer,
Laura: the dead can ask but peace. Did that sound
like ingratitude?" he continued, as he watched the look of
pain upon her face. "I did not mean it so; God knows
there is nothing better, or safer, or holier than peace.
Laura, after a great sorrow, a sharp trial&mdash;before the resurrection 
to a later happiness&mdash;there intervenes a rest, a
silence, a Hades of the soul on earth, which pleasure and
pain are both powerless to invade. I dread its ending!"</p>

<p>They had left the clearing on which the chapel stood,
overlooking the woodland below and the distant Flats, and
were just entering the path that led through the forest
toward the farm, when Laura's eye fell upon a newly-erected 
cross, at the head of the single grave, in the little
churchyard.</p>

<p>"Look, Warren," she said, "that has been put there
since morning!"</p>

"Ah! how like Lawrence!" he exclaimed, returning
with her to poor Mark's grave. "That memorial has taken
up many an hour I have feared was wasted in a worse occupation. 
I am just beginning to know Lawrence. I see
something unlooked-for in him every day."</p>

<!-- page 228 -->

<p>The beautiful hazy Indian summer days come the earliest
and "the longest tarry" around those Catskill Mountains;
and All Saints was a day much to be remembered for its
loveliness and stillness. The dead and yellow leaves hung
yet upon the trees, waiting for the chilly blast chained still
up in the mountain gorges: the faint haze, that to-morrow
might be scattered, hung yet about the lowlands, hiding
the work the frost had done, drawing a veil between the
autumn's fading and the winter's fury. "Silence and peace
on that high wold;" perhaps it was the eve of desolation
and gloom&mdash;but the gloom and desolation had not yet
descended.</p>

<p>The first service in the chapel! Laura's heart beat thick
and quick, as she knelt down among the handful of children
who were to be her charge. How would it seem to listen
again to the prayers she had not heard since her father's
voice read them in the old Borringdon church? how would it
seem, to see Warren in his place&mdash;Warren, her playmate
and companion? It was strange; but as she sat waiting
for the opening of the little vestry-room door, she could not
think of Warren as he now was, but only of him as he had
been&mdash;the clever, high-spirited boy of old, the daring leader
of wild pranks among his schoolmates, the ingenious contriver 
of all the home amusements, the dictator of the little
circle at the Park and Parsonage. Warren and Georgy in
secret session over the Christmas tableaux, Georgy dressing
Warren for his part in the "Twelfth Night" play, or Warren 
teaching Georgy how to emphasize the epilogue&mdash;these
were sort of pictures that her memory restored of the
dear old times at home, the dear old times that were so

<!-- page 229 -->

fatally, so hopelessly dead to them both. She could not
think of Georgy, proud, cold, and self-contained, sold to a
life her better nature scorned; she could not think of
Warren, pale and sanctified, parted forever from all earthly
pleasures and ambitions; she could only think of the handsome, 
happy children who had made the Hiltonbury woods
ring with their careless songs, the clever boy and girl who
had studied and thought together till there was not a
thought in either's mind that was not associated with the
other.</p>

<p>She knew the summer's grass was sere and dead on the
Easter-made grave in the Borringdon churchyard; that the
dust lay thick on the vacant chair in the silent Parsonage;
that a new voice read the prayers in the grey old church;
that new friends and new interests filled up their places in
the homes where they had once been familiar; that pleasures
and rejoicings, in which they could bear no part, were even
now blotting out their memory more completely&mdash;she knew
all this, but she could not feel it; she could only think of
the old times, the old pleasures, the old faces. She wondered 
if Warren was thinking about them, too; if he
remembered what a different service was going on in Borringdon 
church that day; in what dress his beautiful companion 
would soon be standing before the altar, with the
rich light of the chancel window falling on her sweeping
veil, and crimson cheeks, and shining hair. What crowds
would fill the aisles, what murmured blessings would follow
her as she passed out, what insincere good wishes and
empty flattering would meet her as she entered her new
home?</p>

<!-- page 230 -->

Yes, Warren had thought of it all; as he stood for a
moment looking from the little arched window of the
vestry-room, before he came into the chancel, he said:
"On earth as it is in heaven;" he was "martyr yet monarch;" 
he had conquered the last throe of rebellion, the
last struggle of nature; and when Laura caught the gleam
of his white surplice as he entered, she started from her
dreamy revery, but her brother's face and figure, as she
looked up, seemed more dreamy and unreal to her than her
revery. It was the face she loved, but glorified, "stricken
by an angel's hand," white and worn with the earthly conflict, 
but beautiful with the distant brightness of the heaven
toward which it was ever turned.</p>

<p>"God will hear <i>him</i>," murmured Rube, involuntarily
putting down his head to pray, as the young minister knelt
before the reading-desk.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they look so where father went," thought
Steady, watching him with wistful eyes.</p>

<p>"I believe in him," was the quick strong impress that a
glance at his face flashed upon Larry's mind.</p>

<p>"A young saint," said the Reverend Pertinax Pound,
below his breath. He sat on the rough bench nearest the
door, with his stick between his knees and his chin resting
upon it. His knees were at the only angle he meant them
to assume in this place, while he was master of them, and
his stubborn old head had suffered all the abasement he
meant it to suffer; therefore, his searching grey eyes were
not hindered in their scrutiny by any suggestions of reverence 
or decorum. If the prayers woke any sympathy in
him, why of course he'd pray, but he didn't think it at all

<!-- page 231 -->

likely that they would. He was willing to listen to all the
young man had to say; he didn't anticipate much that
savored of sound doctrine; but if he happened to hit upon
any, he was not the man to refuse to say "amen" to the
Lord's truth, come from whom it would.</p>

<p>It was hard to strike Pertinax through the eye, but perhaps 
there was more than he chose to own, even to himself,
or fully understood, in the contrast between his own rough
meeting-house, with its half-peeled walls, gritty floor and
mongrel smell, a cross between tavern and school-house,
and this strange achievement of beauty and refinement in
the wilderness. There was nothing, either, violently to
shock his partisan prejudices. It was simple enough, in all
reason. There was no attempt to cover the rough brown
logs; the daylight came in through long, narrow strips
of windows, one small pane above another. The floor was
paved with broad, flat stones, the benches were of dark, unpainted 
wood, the chancel was railed off with a simple railing 
of the same. The reading-desk was covered with a
rich embroidered cloth of Laura's working, and an altar
cloth of crimson with a heavy fringe swept the stone floor
of the chancel. There was a cross upon the altar of carved
wood, and the three narrow windows above it were, by
suggestive gradation, Gothic in their tendency. The door
of the little chapel was a double one, and was standing
open now, framing a beautiful picture of sky and forest and
mountain for the young minister's eyes when he rose from
his knees and faced his little flock.</p>

<p>"An uncommon little flock," thought Mr. Pound, with
unconscious satisfaction as he glanced around. Yes, but to

<!-- page 232 -->

a little flock, Warren thought as <i>he</i> glanced around, our
Lord once promised the kingdom. It was their hardness
of heart more than their littleness of number that he saw
cause to fear. He must aim straight at their souls; there
was no cultivation of intellect to help or hinder him, no
delicacy of feeling through which to reach them, no sacred
associations to be touched; it was all new, strange and
wonderful to them, and by that newness, strangeness and
wonderful ness he must seize them. His aunt, Laura, Lawrence 
and the Methodist preacher were his only intelligent
hearers; children, slaves and Indians formed the rest.</p>

<p>The question, should he cut down the service, shorten it
to suit their patience and their comprehension, never
occurred to him, or occurred to be rejected, and so unapproved 
as left no stain or blame behind. Of course they
did not understand it fully; perhaps they understood it in
very small part; perhaps the only music that they caught
in all the wonderful harmony of that day's service, was the
music of his beautiful voice; perhaps that most rich First
Lesson had no merit for them but its shortness; perhaps the
Collect was Greek to them; perhaps the prayers were all
unmeaning; but to the steadfast mind of Warren, this was
no insurmountable discouragement. He could look through
and beyond worse barriers than ignorance and dullness; he
trusted more to the church's wisdom than his own; he was
humble enough to believe more in the accumulated wisdom 
of ages than in his own discretion. He would not go
around the barrier that their ignorance and their dullness
placed between them and their salvation; he would not go
around it and meet them on their own ground, and leave

<!-- page 233 -->

the barrier still standing, but he would patiently destroy
it, he would level it, they should walk over its ruins to
receive the salvation waiting for them in God's appointed,
unchanging, sufficient way. He, for one, did not underrate 
the labors of the fathers; he did not care much about
the spirit of the age (for they talked a good deal about the
spirit of the age even then); he did not flatter himself that
he could find out a scheme for saving souls better than the
one Cranmer and Latimer, Wilson and Taylor, Leighton
and Andrews had worked by. He was very certain that
if he brought to his work anything like the faith and steadfastness 
that they brought to theirs, it would be as effective
in the eighteenth century as it had been in the centuries
that had come before the eighteenth.</p>

<p>In His sight, to whom a thousand years are as one day,
these many changes, this advancing "spirit of the age"
which claims such mighty license, must look pitiably insignificant. 
Heaven and earth may pass away, we are assured,
but not one jot or one tittle of His law shall.</p>

<p>There was no pulpit, happily, for Warren to go into, so
leaning one arm and hand upon the reading-desk, and holding 
his father's heavily bound red Prayer-book in the other,
he preached his first sermon, if that can be called a sermon
which has neither texts nor heads, and is not delivered from
a pulpit, and is not read from a MS. A sunbeam struggled
down through the narrow strip of window, and fell across
the red altar-cloth, and lost itself in the folds of his surplice,
and shone out again across the white, transparent hand
that drooped upon it. An occasional dead leaf fluttered
down from its tree and fell among the dead leaves on the

<!-- page 234 -->

ground; sometimes an acorn dropped with a little plash
into the brook that tinkled through the forest, but these
were all the sounds that stirred the solitude. With those
few sheep in the wilderness hanging on his voice, with that
vision of the land of Beulah lying there before him in the
hazy sunlight, with the memory of the churchyard at home,
with that Seventh of Revelation ringing in his ears, it was
no wonder his words had a power and clearness about
them that no eloquence born of earth can have; it was no
wonder that while they had a dignity and fitness that
would not have disgraced the scholastic halls where he had
learned them, there was a simplicity and spirituality in
them that woke a chord in every soul that listened.</p>

<p>Steady listened, with slow-gathering tears, as he told
them for whom this day was set apart, the multitudes of
unchronicled, uncalendared dead throughout the world
who have gone from us, and whose going we have taken for
utter destruction, but whose departure, this good day
reminds us, is not misery&mdash;whose hope is full of immortality&mdash;who 
are in peace. And each grave, on the broad
breast of the whole earth, whether men have marked it or
forgotten it, is in God's care; briers and weeds cannot
hide it from His eyes, neglect and desolation cannot cover
it from His care.</p>

<p>His care for His dead saints, for His living, sinning, struggling 
servants; the great love wherewith He loved us,
the great joy He has in our obedience, the patience He had
with our slow progress and our many falls; what strange,
bewildering news this must have been to Nattee, leaning 
forward, with deepening, darkening eyes fixed on the

<!-- page 235 -->

preacher's face, and groping blindly for the faint and far-off 
glimmer of the truth that alone could solve the miserable 
problem of her life.</p>

<p>What peace and pleasure to poor old Rube, to hear the
dumb faith of his whole life put into such clear words.
What deep and silent thanksgiving must have filled gentle
Mrs. Sutherland's worn and aching heart at this beautiful
fulfillment of all her patient prayers. How many prayers,
indeed, found their fulfillment in that day's service; it
was one of those brief days of comfort and of grace that if
sent too often would</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Tempt the heart<br/>

From sober walking in true Gospel ways."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Choose to believe, not see," is our best wisdom here.
It is not safe for saints to see the good they do; they are
most subtly tempted when they are above temptation; all
hell is gathering itself to assault their faith and spoil their
patience when they shall descend from the mount of beatific
vision into the midst of the cold, careless, faithless, idolatrous 
world again. And Warren Sutherland, saint as he
was, could not live always in the glorified calm of such a
day as that: "the joy of heaven accepted prayer," the
triumph of resignation, the conquest over the flesh, the
momentary vision of the true, was soon to be clouded and
marred again; but the memory of that quiet, holy day was
one of the most sacred he cherished through all the remnant 
of his saddened days.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> dinner, on the second of November, Laura, in
pursuance of those good resolutions credited to her earlier
in this history, brought down a great basket from the attic,
and dutifully went out to gather some few remaining grapes
that had been left on the vines to ripen, or had been forgotten 
by the gatherers, and about the safety of which her
aunt had that morning expressed anxiety. She had no very
definite idea how to reach that large proportion of them
which grew above her head; but she had an abounding faith
in the efficacy of trying, and as the men were all busy, and
Nattee had work enough for two days assigned her for that
afternoon by the undying prejudice of her ancient foe and
constant tyrant, old Salome, she determined to rescue some
at least from the long delayed but surely impending black
frost.</p>

<p>The rough arbor over which the grape-vine climbed was
on the southern exposure of the low hill upon which the
house stood, and was a most sheltered, sunny spot. The
trees around it had shed nearly all their leaves, so that from

<!-- page 237 -->

the sitting-room window Mrs. Sutherland had seen Laura
go down the path, and had defined her object. She could
not see her when she reached the arbor, but she looked out
for some minutes, and then said anxiously to Lawrence, who
was doing a little after-dinner lounging, and was looking
idly out of the other window:</p>

<p>"Lawrence, my son, won't you go and help your
cousin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," he cried, in a tone that would have been
saucy if anybody else had used it, "I'll go and help my
cousin."</p>

<p>And taking up his cap, he sauntered out of the house and
down the path that Laura had followed. Apparently, she
had been soon discouraged with her task, or the sunniness
and seclusion of the spot had seduced her into revery, for
when Lawrence came in sight of her, the basket, with half
a dozen purple bunches in it, stood at her feet, and leaning
against the rough beam that supported the rustic framework, 
she was gazing absently before her, a broken branch
of the grape-vine drooping from her hand, and the most
far-off dreamy look in her eyes. The balminess of the
autumnal noon, the hazy richness of the landscape, the
perfect quiet of the hour, the impossibility of intruding
eyes, seemed to have allured her into an indulgence very
rare for her then.</p>

<p>"What news from Canada, perhaps!" thought Lawrence, 
with a curl of the lip, as he approached her, and the
rustle of the dead leaves beneath his unequivocal tread
brought her back to reality with a violent start and blush.</p>

<p>"My mother desired me to come out and help you," he

<!-- page 238 -->

said, pausing and leaning against the great locust-tree that
stood on the other side of the path, and looking down at
her with a composure that was much more becoming to him
than reassuring to her.</p>

<p>"My aunt is very kind," she said, trying, in a way that
ought to have touched his heart, to regain her self-possession. 
But it did not in the least have that effect. She had
done too much to hurt his self-love to let him pity her at all.
He was glad to give her pain; it was the best pleasure he
had had for weeks to feel her at his mercy, to watch her
fluttering color and pained eyes, to listen to the unsteadiness 
and faltering of her voice, and to know he had the
power to make her feel anything. He had put to flight her
<i>douce r&ecirc;verie</i> by his unwelcome presence; he would do his
rival this despite at least, he would drive him from her
thoughts by whatever means he could, and for as long a
time.</p>

<p>"Why, no," he said, still looking at her, "I don't see
that my mother is particularly kind. She knew you had
undertaken what you couldn't do, I suppose, and wanted to
help you and herself and the grapes out of the scrape."</p>

<p>"T thought I could have reached them," said Laura,
hurriedly, and with a most lamentable want of spirit.</p>

<p>"Well, I must confess I don't see the ground you had
for thinking so," he answered, moving toward the grape-vine. 
"If you'll hold the basket for me, I'll be very much
obliged to you."</p>

<p>When Lawrence said a rude thing, he said it in a tone
that made it for the moment not rude, but only lordly and
unanswerable. It was impossible to be as angry with him

<!-- page 239 -->

as he deserved, till you were out of his presence and came
to think it over. So Laura, like a very foolish, submissive
girl, did as he desired, and held up the heavy basket with
both hands. While he swung himself up the lattice, and
deliberately pulled and threw down into it the bunches that
had so long hung there ripening in the sun. Very deliberately, 
for he looked down through the twisted, gnarled
old vine-stems and dry, yellowing grape-leaves, upon so
ravishingly sweet a picture, that he wouldn't have been
half a man if he had not used every honorable stratagem to
keep it in his sight till he could keep it there no longer. If
Laura's hair was crayony and shadowy when there was no
sun upon it, it waked into soft golden lustre when there
was, and her face was very far from cold and pale when
that vivifying glory rested on it. The sunbeam that fell on
it now seemed to go as deep through her transparent flesh
as through an evening cloud, and to color it with as delicate 
a rose. Did it stain her eyes with a deeper violet,
Lawrence could only wonder, for she never raised them to
him. The loose sleeves fell back from her white arms, and
he watched with a keen eye their increasing unsteadiness
under the continued weight of the heavy basket they supported. 
She shifted slightly the burden once or twice, but
made no other sign of weariness or of impatience; there
was nothing but the throbbing of those slender wrists by
which he could mark the fleeting of these tempting moments, 
the approaching end of this most selfish pleasure.
How long could she stand it? He moved slightly, anathematized 
the unsteadiness of his support, called Kelpie
sharply off from a raid upon the chickens, commented carelessly 

<!-- page 240 -->

upon the grapes as he threw them down into the
basket, and kept a quiet eye upon the fluttering wrists.</p>

<p>"Two minutes longer by the watch," he thought, "and
not a second more." As nice a calculator as Larry was,
however, he was destined to find himself in error on this
one occasion. He had somewhat underrated the feminine
power of endurance Laura possessed, though he had not
underrated her weakness. Of course he did not know how
tired and faint she was, though he did see her lips were
growing pale, and that she pressed them tight together.
Two minutes&mdash;honest long ones&mdash;three, four, five, and still
she did not make a sign of giving up. "What pluck, upon
my soul!" he thought, in wonder. "How her arms must
ache!"</p>

<p>Yes, and there was not a nerve about her that did not
ache. If Mr. Lawrence Sutherland had had to endure the
same amount of pain, spread over the same length of time,
he would have roused the family, thrown the kitchen into
a panic, thundered at Nattee, agonized his mother, anathematized 
his fate, and shown himself most manly in his
entire behavior.</p>

<p>But the impending crisis came at last. A sudden failure
of the strained wrists, and down came basket and ripe
grapes and all. A smothered ejaculation, that wasn't an
execration, and wasn't a reproach, and yet was something
that suggested both, fell from Lawrence's lips as he let
himself down to the ground, and stooped over the basket
to remedy the disaster. Laura was stooping over it too.
Her cloak had fallen off her shoulders, and the bright coil
of hair that was confined at the back of her head, had

<!-- page 241 -->

escaped from the comb, and slid down like a golden snake
about her waist. The grapes lay scattered all over the
ground, under the great plantain leaves and dead tufts of
grass that grew about the place, their ripeness having
proved a most disastrous circumstance, for in the shock of
the fall the bunches had nearly all dropped to pieces, and
individual grapes were rolling down the hill and out of
reach with maddening irregularity and rapidity. Laura
stretched out her arms and grasped the nearest bunches,
the few faithful among the faithless that had not broken
into fragments, while Lawrence, stooping down two or
three times to pick up what had proved but the skeleton
forms of former fairness, at last gave one a contemptuous
toss, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"They're good for nothing; there's not the slightest use
in picking any of them up."</p>

<p>Now Lawrence did not care a rush, at that moment, for
all the grapes that ever had grown or ever might grow on
the place, and it was an evidence of his great power of dissimulation 
that he put into his voice such smothered vexation 
as entirely overwhelmed his companion with despair.
Her aunt's disappointment, Lawrence's vexation, her uncle's
displeasure if ever he came to hear of it, the dejecting failure
of all her efforts to be useful, in close conjunction with her
nervousness and weariness, made her bury her face in her
hands, and leaning down on the empty basket, burst into
tears. Oh, but she was fair to see! Of all the attitudes a
woman's figure is capable of assuming, that abandoned, face-hidden, 
heart-broken one is the most distracting and insnaring, 
and Lawrence's face must have told he yielded to its

<!-- page 242 -->

power, for Nattee, who had approached unnoticed, caught
from its look the first tangible pang of acknowledged jealousy.</p>

<p>Yes, whatever there was of shame or horror in the fact
that she had dared to love her master, it came upon her
fully for the first time then. How far her sin was born of
the unconscious sins of others, how much or how little of it
she would have to answer for herself, whether her hell
ended, as it had begun, on earth, the records of a juster
world alone can show. The justice and equity of this
seemed ever strangely warped toward her; her warm and
generous life was but a tissue of errors, as involuntary as
they were incapable of retraction; her faithfulness and humbleness 
and ignorance were a threefold cord to drag her
down; the rash, unhappy love by which she found her soul
usurped, had grown up without her suspicion and without
her sanction. A child's ignorance of good and evil, and a
woman's strength of passion, an aristocrat's acuteness of
sensation, and a savage's restlessness of law&mdash;these made
up a sort of character most unfitted to meet the world's
contempt, and to feel, without revolting, its iron foot forever
on her neck. A strange, distorted, misapprehended life
poor Nattee's was shaping into; one of those lives whose
contemplation brings only this one hope, that "heaven holds
the sequel."</p>

<p>Lawrence gave an angry start when he caught sight of her.</p>

<p>"What brings you here?" he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>"Mistress sent me for&mdash;her," she said with a gasping of
the breath as she reached but could not master Laura's
name: "there's some one come to see her." And following

<!-- page 243 -->

her slight gesture he looked toward the house, and saw
that Cicily and Katrina van Hausen were even then coming
down the path.</p>

<p>"Laura," he said quickly, going forward to intercept
them, "here are the Van Hausens come to see you."</p>

<p>And while Lawrence met them half way from the house,
and cleverly prevented their further progress toward the
object of their pursuit, the object of their pursuit, springing
up, glanced anxiously round for some way of retreat. She
was too much engrossed with her own distress to notice
the change in Nattee's face; she only exclaimed, hurrying
toward the hedge of lilacs at the left, "Pick up those
things, Nattee, and take them to the house," while she
made the best of her way there herself, to slip up by a side
door to her room, and bathe her face and smooth her hair
before she was subjected to Cicily's sharp eyes.</p>

<p>Nattee sunk down on the ground as her young mistress
disappeared among the lilacs, and rested her clenched
hands upon the empty basket. Yes, that was the way
always. Nattee must do the work. Miss Laura must have
the pleasure. Miss Laura had come out to play at gathering 
grapes, Master Larry had come out to help her; they
had wasted all their time and made all this trouble, and
then turned their backs upon it, and ordered Nattee to
do all their work and undo all their mischief. This was
like the Christianity Master Warren preached about, for
Master Larry to say, "What brings you here?" as if it
hurt him to speak to her at all, and for Miss Laura to cry,
"Pick them things up, Nattee," as if she spoke to Kelpie!
This wasn't what she had hoped for when the young

<!-- page 244 -->

lady first arrived, to be turned away from waiting on her
and walking with her, to give place to stupid little Steady;
slow and stupid little Steady, who was always put before
her, who ate at a table by herself and slept in a room by
herself, because she was a white man's child.</p>

<p>Oh, there was nothing left for Nattee but hard words,
hard work, hard wishes. And it had come of this new cousin, 
that they were all turned against her. Had it ever
been so before she came? Had Master Larry ever given
her an unkind word before his English cousin stole his
heart? Had he not always been kind and gentle to her,
and praised her to his mother, and taken her part against his
father? Yes, yes; all the change had come since <i>she</i> had
come; how different everything had been since that evening
she had ridden Grey Dirck up from the meadow and found
the strangers' wagon waiting at the gate. Oh, that sweet
evening! How often had she lived it over, how thoroughly 
she knew by heart each careless word her master
had spoken at that careless time; the scent of the white
clover, as Dirck trampled it under his heavy hoofs, the
plashing of the water as they crossed the creek, the fading
of the sunset, the faint, chilly damp of the coming evening;
how few kind memories poor Nattee must have had, to
have cherished these so sacredly!</p>

<p>They were enough, at that dark moment, to fill her eyes
with tears and to soften into more than forgiveness the
momentary resentment that her master's harshness had
aroused. It was not his fault; he did not do it of himself;
his cousin it was who had turned him into what he was;
and she hated her&mdash;she hated her!</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>And Nattee rose and went about the work that had been
left for her to do, with eyes not far off and dreamy, as
Laura's eyes had been when she first went about it, but
dark and eager with a restlessness kindled at the forbidden
fire within.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Nattee</span>," said Mrs. Sutherland, hurrying into the
kitchen, "where <i>have</i> you been all this time? Your afternoon's 
work is hardly begun. Everything's lying about just
as it was an hour ago, and here's company coming to supper;
biscuit to be set, pancakes to be made, the silver to be
rubbed, eggs to be looked up, the best room to be opened,
the andirons to be polished, a fire to be lit, and yourself to
be made tidy to serve. I don't know what's the matter
with you now-a-days, Nattee, you want looking after like a
child."</p>

<p>Nattee did not raise her eyes to her mistress' face; she
bent them on her work, and muttered between her teeth,
"I'm not the only one needs looking after, though I'm the
only one's to get it, in this house, it seems."</p>

<p>"Nattee!" exclaimed Mrs. Sutherland, looking at her in
astonishment, for this was the first word of disrespect or
impatience she had ever heard from her. She had not
time to investigate its cause, though, for this impromptu
supper party held out a bewildering prospect for the afternoon. 
Cicily and her sister had come for Laura to join
them in a chestnutting expedition into the woods, where
they were to meet half a dozen more of the flower of the

<!-- page 247 -->

country-side, and Lawrence had proposed they all should return 
to the farm to supper. Suddener calls upon her hospitality 
had often occurred, and the old stone house had been
the scene of much livelier preparations on many former
occasions. But there was, besides the strain upon the good
mother's energy and ingenuity, an abiding vexation and
anxiety that she could not shake off in Cicily van Hausen's 
presence; her confident coquetry, her insupportable
appropriation of Lawrence's attention, her unmistakable
consciousness and satisfaction, were as irritating and
exasperating to the gentle lady, as they were captivating
and acceptable to her double-minded son. That he had
not quite made up his mind about her, Mrs. Sutherland
had latterly begun to hope; his evening absences had
become somewhat less a habit, and his interest in things
at home had seemed a little to revive; but her hopes were
destined to receive a check. Lawrence's manner, when
they met that afternoon, had a familiarity that startled and
a devotion that alarmed her. It could not be, the relaxing
of his assiduity of late meant he had good reason to be
at ease; that it was all understood between them, and he
had no suit to push, for all the suit he had was settled!
If it were so, she could not blame him that he had not
asked her sanction; she had never made a secret of her
disapproval; she could not blame him, but it was a wound
she hardly had strength to bear.</p>

<p>" 'Tis nature's law." Mothers should hold that cross
before their eyes till they grew familiar with it, they
should put it between themselves and their too lavish love
from the time that love commences; they should remember

<!-- page 248 -->

what a mother's love must be at best. All children that
fulfill their destiny, must, in that regard, be thankless.
Love goes forward and not backward: the gentlest son
that lives, cannot separate himself from his mother's heart,
and acknowledge there is another life before him filled with
another love, without convulsing bitterly the heart he
leaves. He may, by years of dutiful affection, soften the
separation he has created, and comfort the desolation he
has made; but it never ceases, for all that, to be a separation 
and a desolation.</p>

<p>There was a little flush on her mistress' cheek, and a
little tremor in her voice, that Nattee did not interpret
rightly; and though there existed no actual impatience in
her manner, there was less of gentleness than ordinary in
it, when she gave her orders for the afternoon, and
Nattee's smothered jealousy was not slow in taking fire.
It was, indeed, anything but a sweet thought to her, as she
hurried through her trebled work that afternoon, with the
new sense of her mistress' injustice irritating her at every
fresh command, that Laura was sauntering idly through
the autumn woods, and that Steady was following in meek
enjoyment of her liberty.</p>

<p>But hard work takes the edge off even such discontent
as this, and by the time the house was ready for the arrival
of the guests, Nattee was in a much more reasonable
frame of mind. The best parlor, dusted and in order,
looked bright and cheery with its new-kindled fire, the
supper table was shining with its best phase of china
and of silver, Salome, hoarse with scolding, was serving
out their supper to the men, Mrs. Sutherland, in her best

<!-- page 249 -->

black satin gown, was giving her last anxious review to
the ranks of sweetmeats, cakes, and biscuits, before the
approaching action, when it occurred suddenly to her
mind, she must have another jug of cream for the west
end of the table. The churning in the morning had left
them but a scant supply for such an increased demand; she
should have to send over to neighbor Vandervleeck's to
borrow some for the occasion. Nattee, very trim and tidy,
was leaning against the doorpost, looking toward the gate,
momentarily expecting the arrival of the party from the
woods.</p>

<p>"Nattee," called out her mistress, "run out into the
kitchen, and tell Amen I want him to do an errand for
me."</p>

<p>But by the time Nattee reached the kitchen. Amen, who
always fled "like withered leaves before the autumn gale,"
at the distantest echo of the word "errand," had eluded all
pursuit, and was swinging from the top branch of the
elm behind the house before the sentence was well out of
his mistress' mouth. After a fruitless search for him,
Nattee came back, breathless and indignant, to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"That whelp's up i' the mow, or down i' the cellar, or
somewhere safe, ma'am. He shot out o' the kitchen when
he heard me coming, and I can't find him high or low."</p>

<p>"Well, Nattee, then you'll have to run for me yourself;
I am sure you can get back before they come. Ask Vrow
Vandervleeck for a jugful of sweet cream for me, if she's
got it to spare, and don't waste a minute on the way."</p>

<p>It was already five o'clock, and the brief November day

<!-- page 250 -->

was very near its close; the hungry pleasure-seekers no
doubt would soon be home, and it behooved Nattee, as a
faithful caterer to their tastes, to make all convenient
speed in the execution of her errand. But Nattee did not
seem to view it so; an unusual want of zeal characterized
her every movement, the chilly evening air inspired her
with no briskness, it only made her pull her shawl tighter
round her, and sent a shiver through her frame as she
loitered along toward the house of the Vrow Vandervleeck. 
It was not a short walk by any means: "field
and fountain, moor and mountain," almost every conceivable 
natural feature intervened between these two neighbors&mdash;features 
in miniature to be sure, but still weary
enough to traverse at the end of a long day's work, and
against a rebellious and discontented will.</p>

<p>"I don't care if I am late!" she thought, as she crept
through a gap in the hedge on the outskirts of the Vandervleeck 
farm. "I wish I may keep 'em waiting. I hope
they'll all be tireder than I am, and twice as hungry before
they get their supper."</p>

<p>There was every prospect of their being, as the serving
of supper depended in a measure on Nattee's presence,
and she took a malicious pleasure in reflecting how much
of the comfort of the family was in her hands. How they
would miss her, if she should choose to run away. Who,
since she had been tall enough to reach it, had ever set
the table there? What a hand Steady would make in
waiting on it! The oaths and scowls the old man would
give her before she got broken in! Nobody but Nattee
knew the places of things in Master Larry's room; nobody

<!-- page 251 -->

but Nattee had ever kept his clothes in order. He never
knew where a thing was himself, he couldn't find anything
without calling out for her; she did more than he knew
to maintain his comfort and to keep him in good temper.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," thought Nattee, with a gleam of triumph,
"he'll begin to think of it if I go away: perhaps he'll want
me back."</p>

<p>Just before Nattee reached Cuyler Vandervleeck's house,
she passed a low log cabin, standing dogmatically up to the
road, without the ceremony of a fence before it, and with
a most uncompromising squareness and harshness about its
rough exterior. Nattee was so absorbed with her own
thoughts, she did not look around at it as she passed, till
startled by a solemn "hem," and, glancing up, she saw the
Methodist preacher sitting in the door, with his stick
between his knees, and his chin on his stick. She
dropped a courtesy and was passing on, when he called
her back. She approached without any reluctance, for
there was something that promised well in his tone. He
wasn't going to order her around, it was evident. Perhaps
he was going to tell her something that she'd like to hear,
for it was whispered about among the slaves that the
preacher called himself their friend.</p>

<p>"Well, my girl," he began abruptly, "so you liked the
young man's sermon yesterday? I noted ye; I saw ye
had hard work to keep from cryin' out before 'em all. I
saw how the good news of God <i>was</i> news to your poor
soul. I saw how that de'il incarnate, that calls himself yer
master, had been starvin' and freezin' it, till it was fain

<!-- page 252 -->

to fill itself with even the husks the old-country swine
devour. I saw ye was just ready for God's grace, and I
was glad the minister put in the sickle. I was glad to see
ye coming to be numbered among the Lord's people, no
matter who called ye to come. The young man means
well; he lives to show that even out o' Nazereth somethin'
good can sometimes come. I suppose he has been followin'
up his victory, and has been praying with ye and exhorting
of ye, through the day?"</p>

<p>Now Nattee, beyond feeling vaguely unsettled and
wretched after the service yesterday, had not experienced
any particular emotions of repentance that she could
remember. The Egyptian darkness of a whole lifetime had
not lifted at once. There is darkness in the dawn; and
though a better day might be at hand, it was breaking
slowly and chillily. She knew she had been wickeder this
very day than she had ever been before in her life, and she
was very much alarmed at what the parson said. She
hadn't known that crying when Mr. Warren preached
about heaven and forgiveness, committed her in any way;
she hadn't had the least idea of numbering herself with the
Lord's people, or doing anything different from ordinary,
and she was very much embarrassed at the inference
Mr. Pound had seemed to draw.</p>

<p>The idea of Mr. Warren praying with her and exhorting
her, threw her into a cold perspiration. She wouldn't go
to the chapel, if there was any danger of that. She was
unspeakably afraid of being talked to about her soul, as all
ignorant, sensitive, imaginative people are, and the wise
young minister would no more have thought of doing it

<!-- page 253 -->

than he would have thought of tearing open the petals of a
wild rose, to let the light reach its heart. The light, he
wisely thought, was strong enough to do its own work on
the flower. So it happened, that while he often talked
with Rube in a way that would have done Pertinax's heart
good, and not unfrequently, as occasion offered, "exhorted"
the careless younger men about the farm, he never had
spoken a word individually to Nattee about the matters of
her soul, and did not mean to either, till the time should
come. She interested him far more than any of the others
did, not excepting Steady, even, and perhaps, if he had
allowed himself to think of those things, she moved his pity
so, he would have found it in his heart to wish that that
childlike, darkened, blundering, misread soul might be the
first fruits of his ministry, might be the first jewel of the
crown laid up for him. He had not overlooked the tears
that his reverend rival built such hopes upon; possibly the
sight of them had helped to make that day the much-to-be-remembered 
day it was; but it was very distant from his
purpose to let the poor captive soul find out it was so
closely watched and its throes so rigorously counted.
Young as he was, he had divine and human wisdom
enough to recognize the folly of such a course, the unhealthiness 
of a forced and fostered penitence, the unreliableness
of a conversion having its foundation in excited feeling; he
was perfectly aware of the incompetency of man to perform
God's work, and "he let that alone forever." He knew
his own part, and he did not spare himself in the performing 
of it; but within his own part, his reverence, his fine
sense of right restricted him. He did not allow himself to

<!-- page 254 -->

think how many he should turn to righteousness, how
many he might be the means of bringing to the truth; it
was for the Lord of the harvest to count the sheaves, and
accord him his reward; it was for him to do all the work
he could before the evening fell.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was well for his continued patience that he
did not see the tares that his enemy was sowing in poor
Nattee's mind that night. She had approached the cottage-door 
in a frame of mind that was innocence and
safety compared with the state of mind in which she left it:
she had been vaguely rebellious and unhappy when she
came; her new teacher gave her a reason for her rebellion,
and helped her to understand its nature; he dignified her
unhappiness, roused her self-consciousness, excited her
sensibilities. Circumstances seemed to favor him as much
as they seemed disposed to thwart his brother minister.
Here was this girl, just dropping into his mouth, as it were,
at the very moment he was thinking about her&mdash;here she
was, fresh from a recent humiliation, the worst a human
heart knows anything about, bleeding from new wounds,
stinging with fresh smarts; what time could have been
happier for the purpose of turning her as he wished; what
moment more auspicious for the planting of the word
he wished her to believe. She would have blessed any
hand that had ministered to her then, she would have bent
to any will that would lead her away from where she
stood.</p>

<p>And as if still further to aid the wrong-minded teacher,
while she was listening with newly roused interest and
startled wonder to his perverted piety and unsettling pity,

<!-- page 255 -->

there came a sound of voices from the woods beyond;
voices of careless loiterers, merry pleasure-seekers&mdash;and
such voices will always grate on the ears of heavy plodders,
weary laborers. The preacher saw the start she gave, and
the pained contraction of her face, and he did not fail to
follow up the train of thought that it suggested to him.
She was standing on the door-step, and he offered no
remark as she shrank out of sight behind the door-post
while the merry-makers passed below them.</p>

<p>"Ha! Good evening to you, Mister Pound," cried
Lawrence's fine voice. "You seem to be playing at
solitary still."</p>

<p>"What luck have you had in your nutting?" said the
preacher, looking down solemnly and thoughtfully at the
group who halted before the door.</p>

<p>"Rather indifferent luck," returned Lawrence, holding
up a half-filled basket. "We haven't turned up many
trumps to be sure, but then we've made the game all the
more profitable by our judicious reception of adversity;
sweet are its uses."</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated the preacher, sniffing contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You don't think so now?" cried Lawrence, putting his
handsome head on one side with an argumentative pose.
"You don't think a game of cards or a chestnutting excursion 
may be turned to great account in the improvement
of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, don't now!" cried Cicily, pertly, moving on.
"Don't get into a discussion. I'm for discussing supper,
I vote we go home."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried Nick van Vechten, joining her "I

<!-- page 256 -->

don't believe anybody but Larry cares for preaching now.
It's growing dark: we'll leave him to settle it with the
parson about the uses of adversity and cards."</p>

<p>Cicily, who couldn't bear Lawrence to talk to anybody
but herself, and who had so little real love for him
that she had no pride in his cleverness, walked on with
Nick, casting back at him a very disdainful and missish
look, while, with a straggling, undemonstrative good night,
the rest of the party moved on after them. Laura was the
last, for Steady had had the misfortune to drop her basket
of chestnuts (by far the fullest in the company), and her
mistress was trying to help her pick them up. But it was
rather too dark, and they were in rather too scattered a
state to afford her much hope of success; the shiny, brown
things had hid themselves in grass and sand beyond mortal
ken and human fingers' reach, and Steady was just trembling 
on the verge of a downright cry, when Lawrence,
strangling his argument with the preacher in its sweet
infancy, seeing the state of things, started forward, saying:</p>

<p>"What's amiss, little woman? Lost your chestnuts?
Well, I think it's rather lucky; I'm so tired of mine, I'll
give 'em to you to get rid of 'em. Come, pick yourself up
and don't care anything about the rest," he continued, lifting 
her up and pouring the contents of his basket into hers.
"There! it's all right now; brush the sand off your apron
and run on. Don't let the others get out of sight of us.
You had better let me carry that shawl for you if you are
not going to put it on, Laura," he continued, in a grave,
quiet tone, most new and unlooked for in him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Nattee heard Laura say, faintly, as they

<!-- page 257 -->

turned away, and those low, mingling voices rung in her
ears with anything but low and quiet music, till dispelled
by the rough growl of her forgotten host.</p>

<p>"A hot-headed, high-strung, unconquered dog!" he muttered. 
"A rebellious fellow, a thorn in the side of piety
and decency. I'll e'en teach him what it is to thrust his
jokes at Parson Pertinax; I'll show him what comes of
throwing his dice and counters always in my face; I'll
magnify mine office till he learns to respect it, too; I'll
teach the young dog manners, that I will." He caught
Nattee's uncomfortable eyes upon him, and he added:
"Aye, girl, that's what I'll do for that precious young Hotspur 
that's just gone down the road, and there's more than
you might thank me if I put him to the blush for once. He
shall be sorry for this, you shall see, my girl. He shall
be sorry for his overbearing ways wi' me, as well as his
wicked ways wi' you and wi' all that are oppressed and
down-trodden. He's a tyrant, and he shall reap a tyrant's
reward&mdash;he shall"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Master Larry don't mean to be ugly," faltered Nattee,
"He's only got that sort o' way sometimes&mdash;he's always
been good to me till&mdash;till&mdash;lately."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Pertinax, turning his keen grey eye upon
her, and scenting afar the secret of her soft-heartedness.
"Ha! he's always been good to you, you say?"</p>

<p>"Always," returned Nattee, eagerly. "He's never said
an ugly word to me till now of late."</p>

<p>"And why should he be ugly to you, I should like to
know? Why shouldn't he speak as kind to you as he does
to that pert young minx who flaunts her black eyes and

<!-- page 258 -->

her red cheeks i' the face o' decenter and better people?
Why ain't Christian folk as well set to work talkin' to you
as to that bold-faced Jezebel? She shames her honest old
father and her sober Dutch blood by her unseemly vanity;
and I never heard it said as yet that half-breed Nattee
wasn't as modest and as decent a young wench as any in
the country. If I had a daughter, I'd rather she'd a black
skin than a black heart, and nobody that's out o' long
clothes can doubt the complexion o' Cicily van Hausen's
heart, after a look into her eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Nattee, "Master Larry knows that as well
as you. Master Larry's safe enough from Cicily van Hausen. 
It isn't <i>her</i>. I know Master Larry well enough to
know he's tired o' her a month ago, and wishes he'd never
seen her. Oh, it isn't <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"Who is it, then? The cousin, I suppose. Ah, well,
she's a sweet young gentlewoman, and may do him good."</p>

<p>"She do him good!" exclaimed Nattee, speaking thick
and quick. "She's turned him into what he is&mdash;she's
false&mdash;she's worse'n Cicily van Hausen. She's made 'em
all ugly to me. Oh, I wish she was away!"</p>

<p>And Nattee turned her face to the wall with a miserable
groan.</p>

<p>"Hist!" said the preacher, thoughtfully; "maybe you're
mistaken; maybe she's only thoughtless; she don't look
like a haughty lady. Are you sure she's ugly to you?"</p>

<p>"She's turned 'em all against me&mdash;she's turned Master
Larry against me," groaned poor Nattee, leaning her head
against the doorpost and beating with her foot upon the
floor.</p>

<!-- page 259 -->

<p>The great-hearted old man looked at her compassionately
and read her story through at a glance. He saw how
hopeless and how fatal was the snare into which she had
innocently fallen; he saw what a dreadful life lay before
her in any event. His sympathies were strong, his discernment 
quick; his heart ached for Nattee as if she had
been his child, and in her wrong he saw the wrongs of her
whole class. He burned to avenge her misery on those
who had inflicted it; in his overweening pity for her, he
never doubted that the wrong, at least on the young man's
part, had been intentional. Those proud, stiff-necked
Sutherlands had always withstood and galled him, the
spirit and the flesh both sanctioned his opposing them.
Nattee did not guess the depth of feeling from which his
counsel came; she only knew he was good and was sorry
for her, and never guessing she had betrayed her secret to
him, hardly knowing she had a secret to betray, she listened 
to his sympathy and eagerly drank in its dangerous
suggestions.</p>

<p>He talked to her of the matters of her soul, too, and
exhorted and prayed with her, and she listened, with a
tempest of strange emotions swelling in her heart, and with
such bewildered excitement of brain, that when she started
out on the now dark road home, she could remember
nothing of his words, and only was tangibly richer in discontent. 
She had promised to come again to-morrow evening 
and listen to her new teacher, and though she did not
know why it was wrong and why she ought to feel ashamed
of it, she certainly did feel it was wrong and was ashamed
of it. She had such a guilty dread of meeting her mistress 

<!-- page 260 -->

again, that only a superstitious dread of the darkness
pushed her forward. Fiery eyes glared at her from every
bush, and pricked her on till, breathless and exhausted, she
reached the farm-yard gate. She lingered for a moment
in the shadow of the barn, looking with dread at the kindly
lights that shone from the narrow, deep windows of the
house, now all ablaze with hospitality; she knew the wrath
that they portended for her; coward flesh and blood
began to shrink at the thought of the rough old man within
kept supperless so long. Ah, there he came; the kitchen
door opened suddenly and fell shut with an ill-tempered
bang. Nattee turned to fly, but Amen dropped from the
clouds above, or emerged from the bowels of the earth, and
grasped her wrist.</p>

<p>"Here she is, massa," he cried, leading her toward old
Ralph. "I've most run off my legs looking for her. I
brought her all the way from Vrow Vandervleeck's orchard
ahold of her han' here. I guess she'll get enough o' playin'
hookie afore she's through."</p>

<p>The cruel old man's cruel lash was never laid on more
unresisting shoulders. Not a cry escaped her, not a struggle 
showed her suffering; but her master felt a dull presentiment, 
as he caught a glimpse of her face by the light
from the kitchen door, that he had waked a devil into
being that might give him trouble in the end.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cicily's</span> too tired to dance," cried Lawrence, as they
left the supper-table, and crossed the darkish chilly hall
toward the shining open door of the "best room."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Cicily's too tired&mdash;Cicily never wants to
dance," cried that young person, looking archly back at
him. She was so glad to be free from the restraint
imposed by the presence of her elders, left now snugly in
the sitting-room, that she danced across to the fireplace,
with a reckless disregard of public opinion and common
politeness.</p>

<p>"Cicily!" expostulated Katrina the thrifty, with a rumbling 
rebuke in Low Dutch.</p>

<p>"Katrina!" retorted Cicily the saucy, with a spluttering
blaze of defiance in the same tongue.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Lawrence the lawless, with a merry
English laugh. "Cicily, you <i>shall</i> dance, parson or no
parson."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Miss Cicily, melting down into great humility, 
as she glanced at Warren, "I am sure, sir, Lawrence is

<!-- page 262 -->

mistaken if he thinks I can't be happy without dancing&mdash;I
don't want to dance at all."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to doubt your sincerity, Miss Cicily,"
replied Warren, with an amused smile. "But it strikes me
you want to dance very much. Your eyes have opened the
ball already, and it will give me great pleasure to know
you mean to follow their lead."</p>

<p>"You don't really think dancing's wicked, then?" she
asked in a very deferential tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I used to think it very pleasant," he returned.
"I have never had any scruples on the subject; but if
you have had, pray do not understand I mean to undermine
them."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't think it's wrong, of course, Mr. Sutherland. It's
only the strait-laced people that follow Dominie van der
Spiegle and Parson Pound that do. I'm sure <i>I</i> think it's
the nicest thing in the world."</p>

<p>She quite turned her back upon Lawrence and the rest
of the group, and devoted her eyes and all her available
powers to the captivation of the clergyman, who, if the
truth must be told, was a subject fully requiring them all.
He was just handsome enough, too, to excite her admiration, 
aristocratic and refined-looking to a degree that powerfully 
excited her ambition, stimulated but not satisfied
with its rustic conquests, and indifferent and cool to an
extreme that much exasperated her inherent coquetry, not
yet quite exorcised by the "emotion" that was supposed to
have usurped her soul. But her touching humility, her
flattering deference, though a very pretty study for the
moment, were thrown away upon the clear-sighted young

<!-- page 263 -->

divine. To him she was a gaudy transparency; he saw the
blank canvas on the reverse side, and the glaring light of
vanity within that illuminated the brilliant picture, and he
caught himself wondering, with a shudder, how Lawrence
came to be so blind. Then, as he glanced again at her
piquant face and flashing eyes, the wonder changed, not
that Lawrence should be so unwise, but that he himself
should be so overwise.</p>

<p>"Heaven send, my cousin's heart's not in this girl's keeping!" 
he ejaculated, as he watched her wonderful hypocrisy.</p>

<p>"Heaven help us! If Warren isn't making love to the
Van Hausen!" ejaculated Lawrence, coming up to end the
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. "Cicily, Dave's waiting for your orders: shall
we have a reel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> don't know anything about it&mdash;don't ask me,"
with a flattering look at Warren.</p>

<p>"Well, you may be sure I won't, then," thought Lawrence, 
turning on his heel. "Come, Dave, stop that vile
scraping; strike up the 'Blue Bells,' and do your bravest.
Nick, Katrina I know'll accept you; the others are all
partnered, I believe. Are we ready? Laura, will you
dance with me?"</p>

<p>And so it transpired that, much to her chagrin, Cicily
was left out in the cold, without even Warren to console
her; for, at the first sound of the negro's fiddle, the young
minister had vanished. Whether the familiar dancing-tune
was unbearable in the recollections it suggested, or whether
he was unwilling to give any offence to his dissenting
brethren that could possibly be avoided, or whether he was

<!-- page 264 -->

tired of an uncongenial scene and retired willingly to his
quiet books and faithful lamp, Cicily never knew, and Lawrence 
never cared to know. It sufficed for that young
autocrat's enjoyment to see his dissembling inamorata
biting her lips with sheer vexation at the fireside, while the
hearty rustics and the blooming lassies who composed the
set, throwing themselves wholly on Dave's mercy, bowed,
and bent, and turned, and twisted, galloped and chass&eacute;ed, in
unquestioning obedience to his enthusiastic music. Laura,
after one bewildered look, regained her self-possession and
endeavored to conform.</p>

<p>"No fine-lady airs to-night," thought Lawrence, watching 
closely every movement. No, there was nothing to
complain of in her; she could not help looking as exquisite
and refined as her companions looked blooming and hoydenish; 
she had dressed herself</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"With care and cost, all tempting, fine, and gay,"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>only to do honor to her aunt's young guests, and without a
thought of vanity. She seemed only bent on pleasing
them, and doing nothing to displease her cousin. And her
cousin's jealous indignation certainly did not appear as
ready to take fire as usual on this evening; his manner
since the noonday crisis had been graver, and quieter, and
kinder than of late. Her full toilet became her so extremely, 
he could not choose but look at her occasionally;
and Cicily, gazing surreptitiously at them from her lonely
corner, raged with jealousy at her unconscious beauty, and
his too conscious notice of it.</p>

<p>There was a moment's lull in the dancing; Laura and

<!-- page 265 -->

Lawrence, standing at the head of the room, were waiting
for Dave, who was gathering himself up for a new figure;
Laura's hand was in Lawrence's, and a pretty look of
expectation and just-readiness was parting her lips, when
there was a slight shuffle of feet and murmur of voices
outside; the door suddenly opened, and Nattee came into
the room.</p>

<p>"Here's a gentleman," she said, "asking to see the
master of the house. Master Larry, can you speak to
him?"</p>

<p>Dave's bow hung suspended in his uplifted hand, the
envy died out of Cicily's eyes, and curiosity assumed its
place. Nick forgot Katrina, Katrina forgot Nick, and all
forgot the dance; every face turned to the door, "as sunflowers 
to the sun."</p>

<p>But Lawrence's was quickly turned back again to his
partner's after the first sharp glance at the new-comer; she
had forgotten the hand that lay in his, and he felt the start
and flutter that passed through it as she recognized the
stranger. The first moment,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"She went red as any rose, then pale as any lily;"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>her lips parted as if to speak, then closed as if in pain;
and Lawrence had to see it all!</p>

<p>The stranger was now within the room, and gazed about
him with the bewildered look of a night-overtaken traveller
thrust suddenly into a blaze of light and festive gaiety.
He raised his hands from the folds of the military cloak that
hung about him, and lifted his travelling-cap respectfully,
then seemed to seek among the dancers for one who should

<!-- page 266 -->

claim to be the master of the house. Lawrence made a
movement forward, and the stranger's eye that instant fell
upon the lady at his side. If his look had been one of
bewilderment before, it was one of wild incredulity and
confused nightmare now. He gave a start, passed his hand
across his eyes as if to reassure himself of the actuality of
their vision, advanced a few steps and said, "It cannot be&mdash;Miss 
Sutherland!"</p>

<p>Laura's breath came rather quickly as she faltered:
"Captain Lacy&mdash;I am so surprised!"</p>

<p>He murmured something inaudible even to Larry's attentive 
ear as he bent over her hand, something to which her
only answer was a devouring blush and suddenly abased
eyes. She almost recovered self-possession, though, as she
presented the stranger to her cousin; there was something
in Larry's manner so matter-of-fact and straightforward,
that it very much recalled her to her senses. This was not
dreaming after all, misty and unreal as it seemed: there
was Lawrence, looking quite as tall and very much stiffer
and manlier than usual, making the guest welcome to his
father's house, and that guest, unconquerable <i>petit ma&icirc;tre</i>
and thorough fine gentleman as he was, through all his
hardships and fatigues, was no other than the man of whom
she had dreamed so long and for whom she had shed such
bitter tears and sighed such weary sighs. It was like
waking from a strange and extravagant dream, and finding
its <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> standing coolly and dispassionately by
your bedside, clothed in flesh and blood.</p>

<p>It did not take Captain Lacy many minutes to explain
the chance that had thrown him upon Mr. Sutherland's

<!-- page 267 -->

hospitality. A hurried journey to New York, on matters
of importance, undertaken without a guide and with no
companion but his African attendant, had resulted, very
naturally, in a most adventurous and uncomfortable manner. 
They had lost their way through the false counsels of
a self-appointed Indian guide; they had on every occasion
taken the most circuitous route to reach the nearest point;
they had marched and counter-marched, forded creeks,
labored through thickets, plodded through marshes, spent
nights in the open air and days in the open country, and
now, at the end of a hard-spent month, they found themselves 
very far from their journey's end, and very much
bewildered as to their whereabouts and general surroundings.</p>

<p>"I hope," Lawrence said, with very magnificent courtesy
as he paused, "that your troubles have ended here. I
trust it will be in my power, after a few days of rest, to
furnish you with a guide and letters that may render the
remainder of your journey easy."</p>

<p>"The trials of a journey that brought me to your house,
sir, would be insignificant if they were thrice the trials that
I have just endured."</p>

<p>And Lawrence did not doubt at all his sincerity, following 
his glance to Laura's lovely face. A man might well
consider himself repaid for a month of worse travelling
than this, to stumble upon "the girl for whom his heart
was sick," and to find her gracious and beautiful as ever,
and capable of such intoxicating blushes on his account.
Larry, possibly, two months ago, would have doubled
Cape Horn or attempted in good heart the Northwest

<!-- page 268 -->

Passage for half the remuneration. But let bygones be
bygones.</p>

<p>The festivities of the evening suffered a serious interruption 
in consequence of the arrival of Captain Lacy and
suite. Lawrence, on hospitable cares intent, was absent for
some time, accompanying him to his room, and leaving his
guests to the care of his young cousin, who for obvious
reasons was a very unfit person to leave them with just
now. She tried most heroically to forget who was in the
house, and what had happened, but her efforts were
crowned with very indifferent success. In the midst of the
Dutch girls' "drowsy frowsy" talking, she found herself
looking absent and uninterested, and she found too that
Cicily was making a note of the circumstance, and in her
extreme haste to get back into the subject discussed, she
stumbled and blundered and got quite entangled in inaccuracies. 
Nobody seemed in the humor for dancing till the
gentlemen should come back; indeed, the music had gone
off to the barn to make acquaintance with the captain's
suite, so it was a happy circumstance that the visitors did
not care to dance. They lounged around rather uncomfortably, 
with the ill-at-ease look of people who are not much
used to having their limbs and their time unoccupied; and
poor Laura felt as if she were personally responsible for the
heavy hanging of both. Nick and Katrina ate apples and
whispered in a corner, and Laura wished from her soul
they'd all eat apples and whisper in corners; but the
others were of that loggy, unmanageable manner of guest
that lies back to be entertained, and only goes when
it is wound up to a game or a dance by the industrious 

<!-- page 269 -->

entertainer, and stops with a click when the
music or the game does. Cicily was in a most vicious
temper, and would have spoiled the pleasure of a much
more harmonious and convivial circle. Laura's pretty,
timid efforts to conciliate her were quite unfortunate in
their effects; instead of soothing they seemed to exasperate
her, and comparative amiability only returned when the
door opened and the re&euml;ntrance of Lawrence and his
visitor, accompanied by Dave, proclaimed the resumption
of festivities.</p>

<p>Cicily's eyes fairly danced at the sight of the red coat
and gold lace of the stranger; she almost forgave him for
staying away so long, and keeping Lawrence, he had made
himself so magnificent. He would ask her to dance, and
she would dance with him and make him fall in love with
her, and in achieving this she would spite Laura and make
Larry repent he had left her standing in the corner through
that first set.</p>

<p>This assumed programme suffered a little derangement
from the captain's going straight toward Laura when he
entered the room, and beginning a conversation with her
that seemed to have no reference to Cicily whatever.
Lawrence gave a look around, and seeing the dead lock
things were at, motioned to Dave to begin to play, and
begged his rustic guests to resume their places for a dance.
Cicily was forced to accept him in default of the captain,
but was much mortified to find him too much preoccupied
to notice her hauteur.</p>

<p>Now this dance was a most trying one to the young host,
and taxed heavily his philosophy and manliness. He knew
perfectly well the impression that it must make upon the

<!-- page 270 -->

stranger; he knew it showed his guests in an awkward
light, and placed him in disadvantageous contrast with the
well-bred man of cities. He had once boasted to Laura,
in a never-to-be-forgotten interview, that he could measure
himself with the men of old-world civilization and refinement, 
and make them and make the world acknowledge his
equality. Now the time had come to verify his boast;
here was the man who was to her the embodiment of civilization 
and refinement, and he must show her he could
bear the test of contrast with him or must sink forever in
her eyes. So while self-respect would not allow him to
make any change in the programme for the entertainment
of his guests provided before the arrival of this most unwelcome 
one, neither must pride and consciousness be suffered
to affect in any wise his own behavior. He had never had
much occasion for acting before; the people among whom
his life had been chiefly spent were very glad to take him in
whatever mood he happened to be, or with whatever manners 
he chose to assume. Lawless and easy, he was very
sure of applause and admiration without seeking them in
any way, and so it came doubly hard upon pride and self-love 
to begin for the first time to trim his behavior with his
rival and his mistress looking critically on.</p>

<p>For mistress of his heart, though he did not acknowledge
it to himself in the remotest manner, Laura was still, and
would be, whoever he might attempt to install there in her
stead. His arbitrary pride and mad self-will would only
overthrow his own peace of mind, but would never banish
her. He might make Cicily his wife&mdash;wiser men have done
wilder things; he might hold her children in his arms, call
her interests his, see her face before him daily, learn to

<!-- page 271 -->

require her presence, and to desire her love; but Laura
would be mistress still. The tame, common household
affection that he would have to give to Cicily would
resemble love no more than the second childhood of man's
life resembles his first. But Larry was too proud and too
reckless to see this. Cicily was too confident and too selfish 
to see it, and Laura's seeing it could have done no
good.</p>

<p>"Shall that man dance this dance, or shall he stand there
by the fireplace leaning over Laura's chair, and watching us
with a superior stare?"</p>

<p>Lawrence thought it over rapidly, and then decided he
should dance. So he strode across the room and made him
a short speech, in substance much as follows: There being
a reel about to begin, Captain Lacy would be kind enough
to take a partner. Miss Sutherland not being otherwise
occupied. Captain Lacy would be kind enough to take her,
and Miss Sutherland taking Captain Lacy, would be kind
enough to instruct him in the Catskill fashion of rendering
that dance.</p>

<p>Now Captain Lacy had not had the distantest intention
of participating in that dance; on the contrary, he had
promised himself the most sweet talk with Miss Sutherland
by the fire, and Miss Sutherland herself had been confidently 
counting upon an escape from courtesy, and shuffle,
and jig. Lawrence's invitation, however, admitted of no
equivocation, and though the captain could have found it in
his heart to have broken his stalwart young host's head for
his impertinence, he could only make a most courtier-like
and highly perfumed bow, and solicit the honor of Miss

<!-- page 272 -->

Sutherland's hand for the reel. That poor young lady,
looking very much frightened, glanced uncomfortably
toward her cousin as she took her place, who made a short,
stiff bow at her acquiescence, and returned to his partner.</p>

<p>Lawrence's dancing was quite as much of an improvement 
upon the dancing of the countrymen of those parts, as
his general character was an improvement upon theirs. An
occasional visit to Albany and New York had taken the
edge off his social simplicity, and had given him glimpses
enough of polite life to make him equal to almost any
emergency, though it is very possible his clever, discriminating 
tact would have been sufficient of itself to have kept
him from any offensive <i>gaucherie</i>. He did not suffer himself 
to be influenced by the damp awkwardness that fell
upon the others at sight of the magnificent gentleman at
the head of the room, but he determinedly entered into the
honest, hearty, homely reel with a careless, manly freedom
and abandon that Captain Lacy himself might have
coveted.</p>

<p>The captain, indeed, it must be conceded, on this occasion 
came off second best. Larry had the advantage of
entire familiarity with what he was about, and the help of
a spirited and sprightly partner; while the captain, feeling
very much above his business, proved himself quite unequal
to it, and before he had completed it, lost much of his magnificent 
complacency, and much of the reverence of the
beholders, besides extremely bewildering and distressing
his partner. And in proportion as the lustre of the couple
at the head of the room waned, the brilliancy of the couple
at the foot of it increased. Cicily, all piquancy and animation, 

<!-- page 273 -->

danced with her whole heart and soul, and Lawrence,
catching new inspiration from her coquetry and confidence,
threw a gaiety and wildness into his movements that saved
them from being rustic, and gave them a picturesque
extravagance. Nobody could help looking at the two, they
were such a handsome pair, Cicily, in her red bodice and
dark tunic, with face and eyes all aglow with spirit, and
Lawrence, <i>malgr&eacute;</i> top boots and brown jerkin, looking the
very picture of a merry, manly, masquerading young aristocrat: 
the rustic, a stranger would have sworn, was put on
with the dress, and would come off when it came off.
Indeed, they were soon the objects of the room's admiration; 
the irregular reel began to drop apart, one after
another stopped, and looked laughing and applauding at
the two so spiritedly endeavoring to dance each other
down.</p>

<p>Dave, entering fully into the spirit of the occasion, threw
himself enthusiastically about as he played, and kept time
with his entire body. Amen, peering in at the door,
giggled, and chuckled, and whistled in a manner that was
quite inspiring; and half a dozen woolly heads outside the
window, with rolling eyes and shining teeth, added to the
strangeness of the scene in Captain Lacy's eyes, and to its
jollity in the eyes of the others. Laura looked wistful, and
perplexed, and half admiring; and when Larry, laughing
and panting, threw himself on one knee at the feet of the
unconquered Cicily, and acknowledged his defeat. Captain
Lacy said, involuntarily and with energy:</p>

<p>"As pretty a picture as I ever saw. Pray, who is the
young woman?"</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<p>The young woman, at that moment, swept a destructive
glance across the room as she accepted Larry's homage,
and threw herself into a pretty attitude, giving him one
hand, and with the other playing with the string of beads
about her neck. But the strain upon the string was somewhat 
too sudden; it snapped, and the red baubles went
rolling about the room in mazy recklessness.</p>

<p>The captain started forward in pursuit of them; Larry
bent down to recover those within his reach; Nick scrambled 
off in another direction, and every man in the room
was soon active in the service. This was a situation quite
to Cicily's taste; she would have enjoyed scattering beads
for them to pick up all night; she loved to be the prominent
figure in a room, and to engage all devotion. It would
have made Laura wretched to be giving so much trouble
and attracting so much attention, but Cicily was in her
element. When Captain Lacy brought gallantly back to
her the handful he had rescued, she was so charming he
could not go away from her again. If he had been twice
as much in love with Laura as he was, he could not have
resisted Cicily's insnaring coquetry. Neither did Lawrence 
choose to resist it for the moment, and the humbler
swains stood gaping round, looking with unconscious admiration 
at the pretty dispenser of smiles, and wondering, in
their clumsy minds, at the easy way in which she talked to
the grand gentleman who had quite struck them cold. It
would have taken a much grander gentleman than had then
been built to have struck Cicily cold: her indomitable levity
of character would have risen to the surface under the
severest pressure of majesty imaginable, and the vanity that

<!-- page 275 -->

ruled her soul and body would have asserted its supremacy
in the face of the most imposing presence that it could anywhere 
have met.</p>

<p>Laura was not given to jealousy; she had too much dignity 
and sweetness of soul to harbor long or often that most
mean emotion; but it could not have been a pleasant sight,
even to her, that lavish waste of manly homage upon unwomanly 
assurance. She only showed, however, when her
cavalier returned, by a shade of paleness on her face, and
the faintest tinge of hauteur in her manner, that she had felt
at all the slight.</p>

<p>About that turn in the tide of affairs, Nattee came in
with a huge tray of olecakes and apples and nuts, and
Steady followed with a great tankard of spiced wine, and
a multitude of jingling glasses. Cicily managed to have a
good many wants, and to keep Lawrence pretty busy; but
Captain Lacy had had too great an alarm on seeing the
change in Laura's manner, to venture within the charmed
circle of her coquetry again. He kept at a safe distance,
and humbly tried to regain his mistress' favor by all possible 
arts of flattery and devotion. But Laura was not a
transparency; people who knew her much better than this
gentleman did, were constantly puzzled by her, and it was
not strange that at the end of the evening, when the guests
were gone, and she bade good-night to him and to Warren
and Lawrance, with the sweetest possible grace and without 
the slightest apparent feeling, he was thoroughly perplexed 
to know whether he had lost her favor forever, or
secured it entirely, or whether, after all, he had ever had
the smallest claim to the possession of it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Steady</span>, you're to make Miss Laura's fire this morning,
and you'd better be about it," Nattee called out to her
young rival the next morning as she brushed past her with
an armful of wood for the dining-room. It was very early,
an hour before the early breakfast, almost in the grey dawn
of the morning, and the house was very cold. Steady stood
shivering by the sideboard, holding six well-rubbed knives
in her hand, her one duty accomplished, and nothing more
to fill up the time till breakfast. There was not the least
use in the child's getting up so early; Salome and Nattee
only scolded at her; but at the first movement in the adjoining 
room, the little Steadfast tumbled out of bed, and
groped about for her clothes and said her prayers in the
dark, and went down to rub her knives and to bring the
kindling-wood for building the kitchen fire, and then to
stand about ready to do anything or to get out of anybody's
way, or to go anywhere she was told to go. She had never
"slept the sun up" yet in all her faithful little life; she had
said her prayers every morning before he came, ever since she
had been old enough to say her prayers at all: it was no

<!-- page 277 -->

wonder that her days were such innocent and unoffending
ones. It is very possible, that when she put her hands together 
and said, the last thing before she got up from her
knees, "Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep me this day without
sin," she did not know distinctly the meaning of the first
and longest word in the petition, but the Lord to whom she
made the prayer knew, and that was quite enough. Children 
bear sealed dispatches often to the Court of Heaven,
their innocent fidelity and ignorant obedience being their
surest passport to the royal hearing, so steadfastly denied
to arrogant wisdom and self-reliant merit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"What are all prayers beneath,<br/>

But cries of babes that cannot know<br/>

Half the deep thought they breathe?"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Steady's prayers were heard, her life told, and beyond
that she had no need to look.</p>

<p>To-day, Steady was to make Miss Laura's fire and go and
wake her up. She had never done it before, so she was a
little slower of movement than ordinary, and stood pondering 
whether she should take up the shavings first, and then
go out to the woodpile for the wood, or wait till she had
got the wood and take both up at once. Salome was not
in a mood to tolerate pondering, and she ripped out a fierce
threat about "giving it to her" if she didn't stir herself,
and Nattee gave her a push out of her way as she came
through the sitting-room door. Steady sighed humbly, did
not dodge the blow, but tried to "stir herself" in accordance 
with Salome's counsel. She raised the latch of the
kitchen door and opened it, and a sheet of soft, cold, plumy 

<!-- page 278 -->

snow blew into her face. A real look of childish enjoyment 
lighted her eyes as they met the welcome sight of
the first snow of the year lying a foot deep on the ground.
It had been falling steadily since midnight, not falteringly
and caressingly, but in honest earnest. The wind was blowing 
and the air was thick with the flakes, careering about
in every possible direction, snowing up as much as snowing
down, Steady thought, whirling about as madly as they
could before they reached their inevitable grave.</p>

<p>There was not a symptom of the path to the woodpile
visible; but in she plunged boldly, going over the tops of
her woollen stockings at every step, and feeling the light
snow dance uncomfortably about her little naked legs. Her
teeth chattered and her ears stung with the cold, but
wrapping her fingers up in her long blue apron, she trudged
on till she reached the site of that ancient pile. The light
wood and chips she wanted, however, were deeply buried
from human eyes; she had to uncover her stiff, red fingers,
and prepare to disinter them. She had just dug down, with
patient perseverance, to the spot where she had reason to
hope to find them, and was struggling like a little woman
to keep the snow out of her eyes and fill her apron with the
chips, when, from some unknown quarter, a huge lump of
snow descended, burying them again completely. Poor little 
Steady sighed, but meekly set to work at the task of
disinterring the household treasures afresh. Her numb fingers 
had just reached the welcome sharp edge of the topmost 
chip, when down came the avalanche again. Three
times the little unsuspecting renewed her work, and three
times was it swallowed up in that mysterious descent. But

<!-- page 279 -->

the third and last time a dark suspicion seemed to enter her
mind, and rising slowly she shaded her eyes from the drifting 
snow with both hands, and gazed in the direction from
whence the avalanche had seemed to come. And there, by
the well-pole, crouched Amen, too black to be hidden in
such a white surrounding. He laughed a most villainous
laugh, rising up out of the snow, and turning two consecutive 
somersaults, he looked back at her only to make that
"odious, vulgar sign" mentioned by Mr. Thackeray, and
then ran whooping off to the barn.</p>

<p>"You are a bad boy," said Steady, with distinct and
solemn emphasis, standing perfectly still and looking after
him. Her chest heaved with a smothered indignation, but
that slow, measured sentence was all the expression that
she gave to it. Then stooping down again, she renewed
her labors, and secured at last her desired supply of incombustible 
matter. Poor little girl! when she got into the
house, Salome scolded her for being so long, and Nattee
rated her for bringing so much snow in on her feet. With
a few dry shavings and a great many wet chips and an armful 
of damp wood, she arrived at last before Miss Laura's
door, and, at infinite pains not to make any noise, reached
up and raised the latch. But with a miserable fatality, the
whole supply of wood slipped from her uplifted arms and
fell with a stupendous crash upon the floor. Not only Miss
Laura, but every soul in the house must be awakened by it,
and Steady stood petrified amid the scattered ruins of her
enterprise.</p>

<p>"I'm not asleep, Steady, don't be scared," said her mistress' 
encouraging voice. Steady gave a little sigh of

<!-- page 280 -->

relief, and glanced toward her. She had pulled the curtains 
of the bed aside as well as the curtains of the window,
and with her half-raised head resting on her hands, was
gazing out at the white snow-shrouded landscape. She had
not at all the air of a young lady who had just waked up,
she had evidently "shaken off drowsy-hed" long before
Steady's advent. The nicest time in the world for thinking
is while one's fire is being made; who would give a rush
for a maid so velvet as not to wake one till the room is
ready and there is nothing to do but to get up. The
brightened blessing of one's pillow is never half so sweet as
when the title to it is past, the luxurious sensation of
repose is never near so exquisite as when its knell has
sounded; that half-hour between waking and rising is
worth all the peaceful night beside.</p>

<p>By and by Laura sank down on her pillow again and
watched Steady light the fire, or rather attempt to light it.
But scanty shavings, wet chips and damp wood are not
a happy combination when ignition is desired. Steady
wearied herself to strike a spark that would live long
enough to produce a blaze in the tinder she held over it;
but either Steady was clumsy or the tinder was poor, or
the damp had infected both flint and tinder, for not once
out of six times did the latter take fire, and when it did, it
generally went out before it reached the shavings. At last,
however, the shavings caught and roared up cheerfully;
but even while Steady's brown eyes gazed affectionately
at the flame, it sank down ignominiously, and having consumed 
the shavings and blackened the chips and drawn a

<!-- page 281 -->

few sighs from the wood, it expired in a little doleful smoke.
Steady did not cry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"She was not prone to weeping as her sex<br/>

Commonly are;"</p>

</blockquote>

but her great, disappointed eyes quite overcame her mistress.</p>

<p>"My little maid," cried Laura, conquering a smile, "I
think you have done your very best; I think it is the fire's
fault altogether. If you go down and ask Nattee, she will
bring up some coals from the kitchen and start it quickly."</p>

<p>Steady went down, and Nattee soon made her appearance 
with the coals, but so sullen and silent as to provoke
Laura's wonder. Nattee had a hundred things to do just
then; Salome was storming furiously because the table was
not ready. Lawrence had just called to Nattee for a shirt
that had a button on it. The old man was growling portentously 
about his breakfast; the strange gentleman's
attendant was waiting in the hall below for hot water,
sweet cream, and nobody knew how many other requisites
for his master's toilette; Mrs. Sutherland had one of her
worst sick headaches and could not leave her bed, and upon
Nattee all the hard work of the day promised to come. It
was not balsamic, then, to see the dainty young lady lying
so luxuriously in her bed, waiting for her room to be warm
and pleasant before she ventured to set her foot upon the
floor; to think that it was her right and her inheritance to
be at ease and pampered, while it was <i>her</i> right and <i>her</i>
inheritance to toil and get no thanks. Why was she made
to differ? What was it but injustice and oppression that

<!-- page 282 -->

kept her where she was&mdash;subject to the caprices of Christian 
tempers, to kicks from Christian feet and cuffs from
Christian hands? "On the side of their oppressors was
power," Nattee thought, remembering last night's lesson,
and through her mind went drifting blindly and uncertainly
the words her teacher had read out of the great, grim,
well-worn Bible on his knee: "Behold the hire of the
laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you
kept back by fraud, crieth, and the cries of them which
have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth." 
Strange, wild reverberations the words awoke in
her darkened soul, hardly thoughts, for she faintly comprehended 
them, but dumb, instinctive echoes of the denunciations 
of the prophet, fierce longings for the coming of
the miseries of which he spoke, fierce thirstings for the
revenge he never meant to teach.</p>

<p>"How strange and sullen the girl's eyes are this morning," 
Laura thought, watching her with half uneasy wonder. 
But when the door closed after her, and the new-built 
fire roared up the chimney, Laura turned her eyes to
that, and her thoughts to the stuff of which her dreams,
waking and sleeping, had latterly been made. It was not
selfish, exactly; a woman is not always responsible for the
way her thoughts turn and the color her dreams take.</p>

<p>The breakfast had been on the table some minutes
before Miss Sutherland entered the sitting-room. The
three young men stood around the fire, waiting for her
appearance; old Ralph had had his breakfast half an hour,
and had betaken himself and his pipe off to the workshop
to do what in him lay to make the day a hard one for the

<!-- page 283 -->

men engaged there. Nattee stood behind her mistress'
vacant chair, and fixed her quick eyes on Laura as she
entered. A more careful toilet than usual, undoubtedly,
a more timid, conscious, vacillating manner. What if, after
all, this brave young officer, with his fine laced coat and
bright black eyes, had come to marry her and take her off;
Master Larry would get over it after awhile, for all he
looked so stiff and ugly now, as the stranger stepped
forward with officious gallantry to meet her, bending low.</p>

<p>"Laura, I'm afraid you'll have to take my mother's
place this morning," he said, rather abruptly, as she
approached the fire.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I warm my hands first?" she said, holding her
pretty hands toward the blaze, while Captain Lacy, gazing
at them, murmured something about</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"The fanned snow<br/>

That's bolted by the northern blasts twice o'er,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and made a swift aurora tinge the whiteness of her face by
his ill-timed compliment. Larry, rustic as he was, would
never have committed the folly of saying a tender thing
with two dispassionate male auditors between him and his
mistress. He would be sharp, pungent, racy in his courtship, 
almost sneering, beyond dispute indifferent, when the
world was listening; his touches of <i>tendresse</i> would be for
her alone, when her heart was listening, when the world
was out of hearing. Instinctively he would have known
he had lost ground when he made her blush that sort of a
blush; he would have known it had associated him in her
mind with something uncomfortable and malapropos. A

<!-- page 284 -->

woman is always uncertain of herself when the world is
certain of her conquest and is thumbing it curiously over
and putting it in all lights before her; a wise man will
keep the world as much in the dark about his passion as is
convenient till he is pretty sure of its success. A lover
who sits down before his mistress' heart and lays premeditated 
and acknowledged siege to it, may wear it out,
but will not enter it in any way more gratifying to his
pride. The attitude of a suitor is an unbecoming attitude;
it must be assumed suddenly, tellingly, half unexpectedly;
for only for a very brief space can a woman safely look
down where she ought only to look up.</p>

<p>Laura took her place at the table very quickly, and experienced 
a sensation of relief when Larry began to interest
himself in the matter of breakfast. She was sure he
wanted to laugh about the "fanned snow:" she wondered
what Warren thought of the whole affair, she wondered
whether there would anything else occur to make her
blush so; she wished herself out of the reach of criticism
with all her heart. The conversation was some minutes
in getting into an oily groove: Lawrence was scrupulously
attentive to his guest, but stiff and silent; and this was his
first meeting with Warren, so that, with the best intentions
in the world toward each other, they did not fall into intimate 
social relations on the spot, which, considering their
nationality and the characters of the two men, is not a circumstance 
to excite astonishment. If Laura had been at ease,
all would have gone merry as a marriage bell, for a woman
generally has it in her power to govern table-talk, however
limited her authority may be in matters of more consequence. 

<!-- page 285 -->

If she has her wits about her, she can make
herself a <i>trait d'union</i> between uncongenial talkers of the
other sex, and bridge over the widest differences of
sentiment between them with an artless laugh or an
unconscious question. Her supposed inferiority, her simplicity 
of character, her ignorance of the causes of their
uncongeniality, make a common ground upon which they
may meet in harmony. But Laura had never been less at
her ease in all her life, and so she did not mend the stiffness
of the breakfast table in the least degree; neither did
Lawrence mend her confusion by sending back his cup in
the matter-of-factest way, with the intelligence that it had
no sugar in it.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm very sorry, Lawrence," she said, with a
blush.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know why you should be," he said, as
if he did know very well.</p>

<p>Warren, who caught then a suspicion of something
uncomfortable, began to bestir himself in the way of talk,
and introduced the war, and its happy termination. Captain 
Lacy was at home there, and talked so well as to
inspire the young clergyman with a respect he had not felt
at first sight of his fine gentlemanliness. From the war
in Canada, they advanced by easy stages toward England
and English politics, and still the military man was the
best man of the three; in truth, he would have been a
very poor man indeed, if he had not been at home on what
he had principally been drilled, since his pastors and
masters had begun his education. Lawrence had entered
but very little into the political workings of the mother

<!-- page 286 -->

country; indeed, at that precise period there was nothing
of sufficient dramatic interest to arrest the attention of one
of just his mind; there was nothing in the latter part of
that unheroic reign of the second George, to stir up his
young blood to enthusiasm of any kind. When an ocean rolls
between the stage of the theatre and the house, there must
be some thrilling thing upon the boards to bring it down.
Larry was of the second generation, and nothing bound him
to England save a very slim sentiment of patriotism; but
try to interest himself as he would, it seemed that he was
partly weaned. He knew the leading events, the leading
men, and had a general grasp of the political tendency of
the age&mdash;but he felt no more personal and actual interest
in them than the hot-blooded Young America of 1860 does
in those same events and men. The great struggle was
some fifteen years off yet, and Lawrence's heart was in the
present.</p>

<p>Probably neither of those three young men, so nearly
matched in years, so widely different in soul, had much
anticipation of the tribulation coming, but of the three,
Warren would catch the faint and far-off gleam the earliest.
His was almost a prophet's soul, in cleanness, in clearness,
in steadiness, in faith.</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows, sir, how you get at that!" cried
the officer, half-impatiently, as in answer to some stuffed,
self-sufficient assertion of his about the future of the
colonies, Warren had said, thoughtfully, it seemed to him,
their destiny, whatever it might be, was a destiny to be
accomplished by itself, whole and entire, detached from
any old world sovereignty, free and unrestrained to run

<!-- page 287 -->

its own course to glory or perdition, the greatest or the
saddest chapter in the history of the world; and that the
silence that intervened before its opening had already
fallen.</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows how you get at that, sir."</p>

<p>"Heaven does know, I make no manner of doubt,"
Larry thought, then said aloud: "I wish you may be
right, Warren. I should begin to love my country if I
thought you were. I'm hanged if I've much affection for
my stepdame; affection for stepdames is an acquired
taste, any how; it doesn't bud i' the breast. And but
that the dowager is such a keen old crone, I should have
hopes of getting from her clutches and shaking off her
powerful gripe. But she knows her cards too well to let
us slip&mdash;such a lusty young daughter as Columbia may
make her a great name yet, may stay her failing fortunes,
and be the prop of her old age. If she doesn't love her,
she'll coax her, she'll wheedle her, with chattering and
toothless hypocrisy, into anything she chooses to dictate.
She'll cuddle and fondle all the spirit out of her&mdash;she's
begun to do it already"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Warren shook his head, Laura looked white with horror,
and the captain looked choked with wrath, and Lawrence
went on enchanted:</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear parson, she's begun at it already. There
isn't spirit enough to say her 'nay' in all the land; as Pertinax 
would tell you, Jeshurun has waxed too fat to kick&mdash;he'd
lay down and roll before her in the dust, but he wouldn't,
couldn't, daren't kick. No, no&mdash;she's stuffed our consciences 
with her maxims of loyalty, and our pockets with

<!-- page 288 -->

the gold we could have got without her, and our mouths
with the bread which she chooses to call hers, and we
must e'en be grateful and lick the hand that binds the
halter round our necks. Ah! The good day isn't coming,
Warren, yet awhile at least. Yankees, mean and lean,
Dutchmen, fat and dull, Virginians, fawning, cringing,
toadying&mdash;they're all the stuff we've got to make our
heroes out of&mdash;the heroes that are to give us a land of our
own to be patriotic about, not somebody else's land that
we're allowed to live in, while we pay our rent and please
our landlord."</p>

<p>"It will be some time before the heroes will be needed, in
my humble judgment," said Captain Lacy, with a slight but
lofty laugh. "My acquaintance, imperfect as it is, with the
policy of the mother country, and with the matchless
organization and efficacy of her forces by land and sea,
makes the idea of resistance to her authority on the part
of these scattered, thinly-peopled, defenceless colonies,
something almost ludicrous in its extravagance."</p>

<p>"But it is just possible they may grow, you know,
if she doesn't put a stone upon their heads," said Warren.</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be ready with the stone, you may be sure,"
cried Larry. "Only let her look out it don't slip off and
get fastened round her own neck in the struggle."</p>

<p>"She will look out," said Captain Lacy, significantly and
shortly.</p>

<p>"May Nattee take the breakfast things away, Lawrence?"
said Laura, rising uneasily.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," Larry answered, pushing back his

<!-- page 289 -->

chair and walking toward the window. Captain Lacy
followed Laura to the fire, and Warren did not move.</p>

<p>"A dismal storm!" said Lawrence, turning from the
window, and coming back to the fire. "Nattee, more
wood, more wood!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sutherland," said Captain Lacy, "I am afraid I
am at your mercy to-day. I am afraid I am not brave
enough to face that storm and turn my back upon this
pleasant fire."</p>

<p>"The storm has only seconded my suit, Capt. Lacy. I
should not have consented to your going if it had been the
finest weather Catskill is capable of. You are surely entitled 
to a little rest, after so hard a journey, as also I am
sure is your esquire, not to mention your horses, about
whose melancholy plight I am much concerned. Why, sir,
I vow I don't think the roan will be fit to leave the stable
in a fortnight&mdash;I never saw a beast more thoroughly
knocked up."</p>

<p>"You're speaking seriously?" the officer asked, with an
anxious look.</p>

<p>"Most seriously. I went out to the stable before breakfast, 
to see if the men had looked properly after them, and
I assure you I'm in earnest when I say, they're both in tolerably 
bad case. The filly your man rides, I find, is badly
lamed&mdash;these rough mountain roads play the very deuce
with the horses' feet. I ruined a fine young mare, some
three years ago, on an expedition to Fort Hunter, late in
the fall; and between the ice and the rocks, she hadn't
a sound leg to bless herself with by the time we got there."</p>

<p>"You quite perplex me," said the captain, knitting his

<!-- page 290 -->

brows and walking once or twice across the room. "My
errand admits of no delay&mdash;I should even now be at New
York. I had only meant to indulge myself with a day's
rest here, at furthest, and even that is of doubtful propriety.
Could no horses, do you suppose, be found in the neighborhood 
that would serve our purpose? I shall be most unfortunately 
placed, if none can be obtained."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," answered his host, "you shall not want
for a couple of horses, while there are so many standing
idle in my father's stable; but you will find the roads
almost impassable for the next few days. I give you my
word, if this snow does not hold up, you could not get
from here to Sopus to-day to save your commission. I
haven't seen a heavier storm in years, and it's beginning to
drift tremendously. You may be thankful you weren't
overtaken by it up in the mountains. I sincerely advise
you to make yourself as comfortable as possible here for
the present; no conceivable blame can attach to you for
not starting on in such a storm, and I promise you my most
zealous assistance whenever it is suitable weather for your
journey. A dull period, no doubt, you will find it; but,
sir, consider it is better than being lost in a snow-drift on
Round Top, or being storm-bound in an Indian wigwam. 
I can offer you chess, draughts, and cards, a good
many old books, and a very few new ones, some tolerable
ale and some capital tobacco, the 'Independent Reflector,'
and a good fire. Be counselled, sir, and accept my
offer."</p>

<p>Laura took this occasion for a quiet exit from the room;
and when the guest, after his deep bow, raised his eyes to

<!-- page 291 -->

ask his mistress' permission to accept the tempting hospitality, 
there was no mistress present to accord it.</p>

<p>Laura knocked gently at, and entered noiselessly, her
aunt's darkened apartment. She knew enough of headaches 
to be very unobtrusive, and peeped through the curtains 
of the bed as silently and softly as the first ray of
dawn. The poor patient lady on the bed faintly extended
her hand and begged her to sit down by her.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, my dear," she said, speaking as if it
hurt her, "I am very sorry to leave everything and go to
bed, just when this gentleman's here. I hope Salome will
take pains with things, and Nattee won't give any trouble.
I tried to get up, but I could not. Was the breakfast nice,
my child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very nice, dear aunt. It could not have been nicer
if you'd seen to it yourself. I think the coffee was the
best we've had for a month&mdash;the cakes were as light as
snow, and the birds were done to a charm. Larry, I know,
was pleased with them, and Captain Lacy was helped
twice."</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said the poor lady, with a sigh. "I
only wish I were as sure of dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, my dear Aunt Andria, please leave that to
me, and don't think about it once. Salome's delightful
to-day; I haven't heard her say a cross word (principally
because she had not listened, it is to be feared, however),
and Nattee's uncommonly steady. Everything will go on
right, you may be very sure. Captain Lacy has been
roughing it in camp for six months, and he will not be apt
to notice whether everything is in perfect order or not."</p>

<!-- page 292 -->

<p>"But your uncle will," murmured Mrs. Sutherland;
"he's sure to find fault if I haven't attended to everything
myself."</p>

<p>"He's sure to find fault either way," thought the niece;
but she only said, "I think we are all used to my uncle, and
will not mind it if he does."</p>

<p>"And I'm so worried about Larry," said the mother,
turning her troubled eyes on Laura. "I'm afraid he won't
be civil to the stranger. He's so self-willed, and takes such
strong prejudices, and there's no turning him."</p>

<p>"Why, aunt, that's the last thing to be afraid of," cried
Laura, quickly, and with animation; "he is wonderfully
polite to Captain Lacy. He urges him to stay most earnestly, 
and pays him every possible attention."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," sighed Mrs. Sutherland, in a relieved
tone; "I was afraid he wasn't pleased last night when he
came out into the sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Did he seem vexed?" Laura asked, rather hesitatingly,
looking at her aunt.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I thought he did. But perhaps it was only
because he was afraid that Cicily would be taken with his
fine uniform. Ah! poor boy!"</p>

<p>The tendency of Mrs. Sutherland's mind was so hopelessly 
to afflict itself, and the view she took of everything
was so dark a view, it seemed useless to attempt to reason
away her troubles; and Laura very wisely said,</p>

<p>"Let me read to you a little in &agrave; Kempis, Aunt Andria,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child. If you do not mind it," said the poor
sufferer, gratefully.</p>

<!-- page 293 -->

<p>And Laura took down from the high shelf above the fire
place the old well-worn &agrave; Kempis, over which the poor
lady's sad head had so many times been bowed, and which
had filled up so many gaps in her hard, weary days. "Of
the Highway of the Holy Cross" Laura read, and, it is
needless to say, was the better for the reading. Young and
old, rich and poor, scholar and peasant&mdash;all find they can
sit at the feet of the humble-minded monk of Mount St.
Agnes, "whom Jews might bless, and Protestants adore,"
and learn of him the things that make for their peace.
With Laura, the book had the dearest associations, and was
a daily study; it had been, for many years, poor Mrs.
Sutherland's secretly-cherished comforter; Warren read it
nightly, after he had put away his books of study; Pertinax 
read it aloud to himself, walking up and down his dismal 
cabin, and muttering his occasional approbation; and
even Lawrence read it when he was restless, and "could
not please himself" with either more learned or lighter
books. That silent recluse has had a vaster audience, perhaps, 
than any mere mortal preacher ever had: different
kindreds, and peoples, and tongues have heard him speak in
their own language the wonderful works of God, and daily,
it may be, have been added to the Church, through him,
such souls as would accept salvation.</p>

<p>The look of trouble and despondency passed out of the
listener's eyes, as Laura read; the best of us have memories
so short, it helps us vastly to con our spiritual lesson over
every day, to put plainly before our eyes every day whose
we are and whom we serve, what we have renounced and
what we must expect. If we trust solely to our memories,

<!-- page 294 -->

we shall be very apt to find them much fuller of the "things
seen," most treacherous of the "things unseen." Poor
Mrs. Sutherland, indeed, had found her life "signed on
every side with crosses," and seemed in no danger of forgetting 
its grim lesson; but the teaching of love and grace,
that was the key to all the gloomy problem, sometimes she
failed to reach. She never ceased to be patient, she was of
too gentle a nature, and too meek a faith for that; but
sometimes the cross was ground too deeply in her soul to
suffer her to see its meaning and be thankful for its pain.</p>

<p>"And how dare I seek any other way than this royal
way, the way of the Holy Cross?" thought Laura, as she
shut herself into her own room, to master her discontent.</p>

<p>And again and again she read, but could not yet assent:
"Assure thyself thou canst not have two paradises: it is
impossible to enjoy delights in this world, and after that to
reign with Christ."</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">"Dis-moi qui tu aimes, et je te dirai qui tu es."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span> had been in to report the successful termination
of the dinner anxiety to her aunt, and to cheer her with
assurances of the entire neutrality of her uncle on the
question of the stranger's visit, and his encouraging abstinence 
from insulting criticism on home matters, and had
comforted and cheered the poor lady not a little; when, as
she left the room, thinking of some fresh order for Salome,
she hurried through the hall, and had opened the door
of the sitting-room, and was half way across it, before she
saw who was its only occupant. Now the storm, contrary
to Larry's predictions, had begun to abate before twelve
o'clock, the wind died away, the snow-flakes lessened every
minute, and about one o'clock they had ceased altogether,
and the sun came palely out, and the storm was a thing
of the past. Capt. Lacy's spirits had not appeared to rise
with the mercury, however, nor his content to shine with
the clearing sky; and Ralph's remark that there had been
just snow enough to make good sleighing, and the highway 
would be well-beaten before sundown, had thrown him
into a very abstracted and uncomfortable mood. He
endeavored manfully to interest himself in the table-talk,
and to sustain his part, but he was evidently pre-occupied

<!-- page 296 -->

and uneasy, and glanced occasionally out of the window
with an anxious, absent look, that clever young Mr. Sutherland 
was not slow in interpreting.</p>

<p>It was most perverse and unaccountable in this young
gentleman, but he seemed to have no desire stronger than
the desire to retain his guest. He was not contented with
offering all necessary hospitality and entreaty, but he really
seemed bent upon undermining his guest's conscientious
scruples, and drowning all suggestions of duty with his
subtle and seductive reasoning. Of course, he had too
much intuitive good-breeding to press his hospitality or
zealously urge his invitation, but it was very clear to Laura
he was determined upon retaining him for another day at
least. Now perhaps Laura ought to have thanked him very
much for his assistance, but very perversely and unaccountably, 
she did not thank him in the least; indeed, it piqued
her very much to see how cordially he seconded the stranger's 
suit. Perhaps he did not know the stranger was her
suitor? It was not probable he had so soon lost the clue he
had been so quick to seize the night he wound up that long,
long ball of worsted, with his eyes upon her face. It was
not probable that so clever a spectator had failed to see the
little by-play that he was not meant to see; there was not
the least chance that he had not seen all, and was not
doing what he did designedly. And supposing Laura to be
indifferent to all but the flattery of the devotion of both
these men, she could not have been a woman, and not have
resented the utter indifference that marked her cousin's
course; for little as she may have desired it, she could not
help knowing he should by right have been her lover, and

<!-- page 297 -->

had paid her a very poor compliment by falling in love
with Cicily van Hausen. No woman thanks a possible
lover for furthering the suit of one who ought to have been
his rival, even if she wishes to have the suit furthered; the
sweetest, fairest, most womanly woman that ever lived, has
a strong, unconscious element of vanity in her composition
that rises to resent the failure of a homage to which she
feels herself entitled.</p>

<p>After a lengthened dinner and a prolonged smoke, Lawrence 
had proposed to Captain Lacy to go with him to the
stable, and judge for themselves of the condition of the
horses. There Laura now supposed them to be, until her
abrupt entrance into the sitting-room, roused from his
thoughtful attitude by the fire, the very last person with
whom she was prepared to hold an interview. Not yet,
not yet, is the thought that springs between a woman and
her lover's declaration, be it welcome or unwelcome.</p>

<p>"How shall I escape," Laura's eyes said, as they met
Captain Lacy's for an instant, in desperate confusion.</p>

<p>"Miss Sutherland," he said, starting forward, and speaking 
agitatedly and low, "may I see you a moment by
yourself? You will not refuse me that, I trust!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Laura, hurriedly, turning very white.
"If you will excuse me for an instant, while I deliver a
message from my aunt."</p>

<p>And she dissolved from his sight, and assumed bodily
shape on the other side of the kitchen door. But what
a palpitating, fluttering, frightened bodily shape it was, to
be sure. Lawrence had just entered from out-doors, and
was knocking the snow off his feet on the kitchen mat,

<!-- page 298 -->

when he found himself suddenly confronting his cousin, reddening 
and whitening, trembling and panting from her
recent most imminent adventure. He knew who was in
the sitting-room, ergo he knew what had agitated her so.
It was not evident in his manner, for he was unusually self-possessed 
and easy&mdash;a sort of self-possession and ease
which his ill-wishers might have called, on that occasion,
impudence, perhaps, or at least, assurance. He kicked the
snow very deliberately from his feet, and looked attentively
at her, while Salome, lifting herself out of the bread-trough,
said graciously:</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Laura, chile, what's wanted now?"</p>

<p>Why, what was principally wanted, was an asylum from
the terrors of the other room, but for obvious reasons,
Laura could not tell Salome so; and as for the errand on
which she had come, she could not for her life remember it.
What was it, what did her aunt want Salome to make
for supper?</p>

<p>"I came to&mdash;I mean&mdash;my aunt wants&mdash;I've&mdash;I've forgotten 
what&mdash;for supper," she stammered, in confusion,
while Salome stared in amazement, and Lawrence checked
himself in a slight amused laugh.</p>

<p>"Better go back into the sitting-room and think it up,
Laura," he said, carelessly, emptying his pockets slowly of
some samples of grain and dried ears of corn, and doing
nothing whatever to relieve her embarrassment. Nothing
intentional that is, but in reality, that careless laugh
had reinstated Laura's pride, and helped her memory considerably.</p>

<p>"My aunt wants you to make something for supper that

<!-- page 299 -->

she was speaking to you about last week&mdash;some new sort
of warm bread, I think. I don't believe I ever tasted it:
she said you knew the recipe."</p>

<p>"Love the chile! What is she talkin' about," murmured 
Salome, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>Now Laura had recalled the name very distinctly, but to
acknowledge that, would be to admit that she had been in
a state of embarrassment and agitation before, and that
would be tantamount to admitting, either the gentleman
she had left so abruptly in the sitting-room or the gentleman 
she had encountered so suddenly in the kitchen, had
the power to excite and agitate her greatly, and such admission 
she could not allow.</p>

<p>"I don't think you have made it since I've been here,"
she went on rather quickly, but quite composedly. "I
believe you used to make it last year. My uncle likes it
very much; it is raised with yeast, and has eggs in it, if I
remember right."</p>

<p>"The chile can't be talkin' 'bout pumpkin bread, you
don't think, Massa Larry, now?" cried Salome, throwing
herself into an attitude.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I can't think anything about it, Salome;
but as a matter of speculation, I might say, I didn't much
believe 'the chile' knew exactly what she was talking
about herself."</p>

<p>"The chile," a very pale one at that moment, turned her
back upon the speaker, and picked her way daintily to the
fireplace, saying:</p>

<p>"Yes, it was pumpkin bread my aunt wanted, I remember. 
She told me this morning, but I forgot to tell you."</p>

<!-- page 300 -->

<p>"Pumpkin bread! Three o'clock! Ready 'gainst supper-time!" 
ejaculated Salome, in a voice bristling all over
with exclamation points. "Massa Larry, what d'ye think
o' that&mdash;what d'ye think o' that, for a young woman goin'
on twenty? Cicily could tell her better, eh, Massa Larry?
Cicily wouldn't be askin' to ha' pumpkin bread raised up in
a couple o' hours, now would she, massa&mdash;come, now would
she?"</p>

<p>Larry gave a short laugh, and said he didn't believe she
would. "But since when did Cicily get into your good
graces, Salome, I'd like to know? If I remember right,
you didn't adore her formerly."</p>

<p>Salome, cunning old hypocrite, did not adore her then;
but she had cleverness enough to see she was likely very
shortly to call her mistress, and that the sooner she conquered 
aversion and began devotion the better for herself.
She had had a glorious easy life under Mrs. Sutherland,
senior, but she saw rocks ahead, when the black eyes should
come into power. She would see, however, what flattery
could do, though her whole soul revolted from the change;
she would hold by the administration while her powers of
dissimulation lasted. Salome was a shrewd, selfish old
woman, not destitute of good feeling and a certain sort of
faithfulness, but quite unembarrassed by anything like
principle or sincerity. She was fond of Massa Larry; he
was "her boy," and the only living thing she did care for,
except a superannuated hound who had the freedom of the
cellar, and who was honorably lodged in the chimney-corner 
whenever he would accept that hospitality. She hated
her master with the most generous and unstinted hatred,

<!-- page 301 -->

and was not sparing in the expression of it, except in his
very presence, knowing that it was the sentiment of the
household, and an understood thing. She was ungracious
and surly half the time with Mrs. Sutherland, knowing
quite well how far she could go, and going to the very end
of her rope. Of Larry she had to beware, and perhaps
that was the reason why she was fond of him and flattered
him and petted him to the last degree. Laura she had at
first made much of, as the possible mistress of the house, but
recent indications guided her wisely to pay her court to
the young termagant of the black and flaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried, not slow to notice she had interested
him by what she said, though he was busy about the grain,
of course, "ah, Massa Larry, I didn't use to like her when
she was a rompin' tomboy thing, wi' jest the wickedest
ways o' any critter goin'; but now she's growed up inter
sich a likely young woman, I say let bygones be bygones.
Such a thrifty, tidy housekeeper as folks says she is! It'ud
be a shame to be a twittin' her with it, that she used to be
wilder'n a hawk. I don't think so much o' her bein' handsome; 
there's plenty o' handsome ones as isn't worth their
salt (a back-handed slap at Laura); but she's a gal's as is
good for something 'bout the kitchen, and keeps things
goin', so I've heard folks say. I can't abear to see young
women tendin' o' their white hands, and bein' waited on.
Let 'em put their shoulder to the wheel, I say, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the wheel'll be apt to go round," said Larry.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Salome responded, not quite pleased with
being helped to the end of her sentence so fast, however,
and with a very doubtful sense of the good faith of her

<!-- page 302 -->

assistant. She ceased rather abruptly singing Cicily's
praises, and turning round, exclaimed in a scratchy, snarly
sort of way, that that Nattee was the pest of her life.
Why didn't she go about her business, and not stay pottering 
over that kettle of coffee all the afternoon. It was
scorched blacker'n Rube's face half an hour ago; and
sniffing around wrathfully, she proclaimed it was burnt to a
cinder. There were grounds for such an assertion. Nattee,
who had been stirring the coffee absently for some time,
looked up with keen interest when Laura came into the
kitchen, and the coffee had a vacation during the dialogue
that ensued. She did not move or speak, but still half-kneeling, 
with her hand suspended over the fragrant kettle
on the fire, and her head turned over her shoulder, she
watched with keenness alternately Lawrence's and Laura's
face. And when Laura came toward the fire and stood
before it, and thinking herself unwatched, with an irrepressible 
gesture twisted her hands together and bit her lip,
Nattee's eager eyes, burning on her face, recalled her
sharply to self-control. An indignant, startled look the girl
got for her impertinence, much such a look as Lawrence
had given her under the grape-vine yesterday. She was
guilty of having seen her master's passion in his eyes and
her mistress' emotion in her gestures; by every law of
justice and humanity, she should suffer for her wonderful
audacity. Her eye did not sink under Laura's glance, it
flamed that "old wrathe" back upon her of which her
heart was full.</p>

<p>Salome, sniffing about portentously, scented unmistakably
the burning coffee, and waddled over to the fire; standing

<!-- page 303 -->

with arms akimbo before it, she delivered herself of a
scathing rebuke to the lackless priestess of Mocha, and
commanded her to take the kettle over to Massa Larry for
his further conviction of her enormities.</p>

<p>"I won't touch it," she muttered, rising sullenly.</p>

<p>"You won't!" cried Salome, with a scowl of rage and a
falter of astonishment. "Ef you don't take that there
kettle this minute over to Mass' Larry, I'll see you well
thrashed 'fore sun down. I'll tell ole massa every word."</p>

<p>"Tell him, then!" cried Nattee, with sudden passion,
flinging the ladle across the kitchen and glaring like a
young tigress. "Tell him I don't care for him nor his
thrashings, ner for you ner your lyings. Tell him I'm glad
I burnt the coffee, an' I'll do it next time, if I choose."</p>

<p>"Massa Larry, hear that, now, will ye!" exclaimed
Salome, with a wicked sense of triumph.</p>

<p>"What good will my hearing it do?" he returned, going
on with his work.</p>

<p>"No good," cried Nattee bitterly, "for he don't care
whether I'm thrashed or not. He wouldn't raise a finger
if the ole man was killin' me. No good; you needn't ask
him to listen."</p>

<p>"Raise a finger, indeed!" ejaculated Salome, scornfully,
"Ef he sarved ye right, he'd raise a horsewhip over ye.
It's all along o' his an' the missus' easy ways that ye're the
good-fer-nothin' that ye are&mdash;the pest o' the house, lazy,
shiffless, pryin' thing, meddlin' in everybody's business but
yer own."</p>

<p>"Salome, that's enough," Lawrence said, with quiet
authority, turning to leave the room.</p>

<!-- page 304 -->

<p>"Yes, yes," muttered the old woman in a suppressed
tone, not able to head off the stream quite so suddenly,
"it's all very fine now; wait till there's a new missus here,
we'll see ef Nattee won't have to stan' round then."</p>

<p>"I'll die first," cried Nattee, with flashing eyes. "Ole
missus or new missus, you'll see if I'll be put upon&mdash;you'll
see if I'll bear it any longer. I won't lie an' cheat like you,
but there's other ways beside lyin' and cheatin' to show
I'm made o' flesh an' blood, an' can sting back when I'm
hurt too hard."</p>

<p>"You young cuss!" hissed Salome between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Nattee knows better than that," Lawrence said, as he
passed out of the door. "Nattee knows she's had as much
kindness as she has deserved all her life, and more, most
people say. You have been a good girl and faithful so far;
don't spoil it all now."</p>

<p>There was something in his tone, kind but firm, determined 
but forbearing, that brought a sudden tempest of
tears to poor Nattee's eyes, and as the sitting-room door
closed after him, the attic door fell to after her as she
bounded up the stairs, blinded and panting, to fling herself
upon her low bed and sob out her misery alone.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," muttered Salome, tightening her fat fist and
looking most satanically ugly in her soliloquy, "aye, aye,
mighty soft-hearted is Massa Larry. Wonder how it 'ud
ha' been ef Amen, or Dave, or ole Salome, had sassed him
so. A purty mulatter wench's a different sort o' thing from
a nigger boy black as a coal, or an ole woman ugly as the
devil. Oh yes, my massa, bless yer heart, I know ye&mdash;I
know ye. Let Salome alone for seein' through folks; while

<!-- page 305 -->

they ain't a lookin', she's a readin'. She knows a thing or
two; she could tell 'em more'n they could tell 'emselves,
maybe. She knows what makes Nattee's eyes blaze so,
and what makes Massa Larry so terrible forbearin'!"</p>

<p>She had almost forgotten that she had an auditor, till an
indignant "Salome!" escaped from Laura's lips, and the
old woman glanced at her, and started to find a look of
unutterable surprise and anger on her face. Salome, after
a moment's scrutiny, gave an inaudible chuckle, and subsided 
into good nature. Possibly she thought she had
found something new to read.</p>

<p>"I don' mean nothin', my chile," she said, "nothin'.
Salome gits a little crossish onst in a while&mdash;a little crossish
when she sees the young folks doin' jist what they're a
mind to do, and the ole folks bein' put down. An' it ain't
i' the natur' o' a fine young man like Massa Larry not to
feel a little sort o' sorry for a wench that's allers been
workin' her fingers to the bone to please him, ever since
he was a laddie. He thinks more o' her naturally than o'
ole Slomy, who's sarved him all her life, and who'd die fur
him any day&mdash;any day."</p>

<p>And Salome sighed like a great black furnace as she was.
But all her sighs could not simulate the loyalty, and misery,
and devotion of poor Nattee's tears, and Laura turned
away, doubly disgusted and dismayed.</p>

<p>"Stay, Miss Laura, chile," quoth the old woman, softly,
following her. "Stay a minute. Don' you go now and
say anything 'bout my bein' out o' temper, will ye? Don't
twit Massa Larry 'bout his not scoldin' now, my chile. It
might make trouble. It's all nothin'&mdash;nothin'."</p>

<!-- page 306 -->

<p>"Your master would be very angry if I should tell him
what you've said," Laura returned, shrinking with involuntary 
disgust from the familiarity of the great black hand
laid on her arm.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Salome, a little alarmed, and a good deal
"riled." "Oh, ye mustn't take all Slomy's jokes to heart.
Massa Larry wouldn't know what ye was talkin' 'bout ef
ye did tell him. Massa Larry never thought o' sich a thing&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"If he did!" thought Laura, as, with a haughty step and
a very pale face, she left the kitchen.</p>

<p>Oh, that she could have escaped the sitting-room just
then! How could she look at Lawrence, and endure his
presence after what that dreadful old woman had suggested. 
She could hardly control her face, or govern her
voice as she entered the room. Captain Lacy, a glance
told her, was leaning against the mantelpiece, watching
anxiously the door; Lawrence was sitting before the fire,
leaning forward, holding Kelpie between his knees, and
laughing oddly and merrily at her failures to sustain herself 
in an upright attitude. Somehow, that scene with
Kelpie and Nattee, and the fishing-tackle at his feet, flashed
across her mind. If Salome had been right!</p>

<p>Captain Lacy gave a despairing look toward Lawrence,
and started forward to place a chair for her. At that
moment Warren entered from the hall, and blasted her
hopes of retreat.</p>

<p>"Do you want your embroidery-frame?" he said, as she
sat down with a nothing-to-do, uncomfortable air, in the
chair the captain placed at one side of the fire.</p>

<!-- page 307 -->

<p>"Yes, thank you," she said, gratefully, feeling that if she
had to stay it would be unspeakably a relief to have occupation 
for eyes and hands.</p>

<p>The frame stood in the farthest corner of the room.
Warren and Captain Lacy both started for it at once, one
dutifully, the other enthusiastically. It was rather a light
thing to be carried by two able-bodied men, and there was
something in a faint degree funny in the scene. Lawrence
caught it, as he always caught the ludicrous, before any one
else, and looking up, he said, with a laugh in his eye:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Laura, for not going too. I didn't see till
'twas too late."</p>

Laura flushed angrily, not feeling a bit disposed to laugh&mdash;anything 
else&mdash;and accepted her admirer's service without
looking up.</p>

<p>"Steadfast&mdash;let's have some more wood," cried Larry,
pulling Kelpie's silken ears and glancing over his shoulder
at the little maiden by the side-board.</p>

<p>Larry had a passion for a jolly fire, and his calling for
wood then showed he meant to enjoy an idle hour before
it, and Laura's spirits revived; she was safe from the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> 
at least for that time. Warren sank down languidly
upon the settle, and the captain was obliged to content himself 
with a chair opposite, commanding a good view of
Laura bending over her embroidery, and Larry beside her
pinching his favorite's ears. Steady's replenishment of
wood blazed up lustily, doing the little woman's heart good
as she leaned against the jamb and gazed at it. Altogether,
the room, homely though it was, was quite attractive
enough to make the idea of starting out in the face of the

<!-- page 308 -->

cold wind extremely distasteful to the traveller. He did
not think he had ever seen anything more ravishing than
the contour of Laura's head bowed over her work, and the
shade of her hair with the firelight playing on it; he had
never known anything more tempting and homelike than
the whole air of the room; its snugness, and warmth, and
comfort appealed to his indolence and self-indulgence, its
picturesqueness and oddity seduced his cultivated eye. He
was spell-bound, enchanted; how should he break the spell?
Every glance out at the sunbeams slanting across the snow
gave him a goading thrust; every glance in upon the head
stooping over the embroidery riveted his chains. He could
not, would not, stir till he had had his answer; <i>&agrave; bas</i> conscience, 
<i>&agrave; bas</i> all but love.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see," said Warren, by way of being civil,
"that you have concluded to remain. It would have been
a most useless exposure to have started this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I don't know that I have concluded to
remain," exclaimed the military gentleman uneasily, getting
up and walking to the window. "I don't know but it is
best to start to-night. If we got under weigh immediately,
I think we could make a few miles before dark, and be
ready to start earlier in the morning than I should choose
to disturb you, if I accepted your hospitality for another
night."</p>

<p>"Captain Lacy, you are incorrigible," cried Larry, tossing 
back the brown curls from his forehead, as he lifted
himself up, and pushed Kelpie away. "I never threw
away so many arguments upon any one before. I see you
don't intend to be influenced by me. What more can be

<!-- page 309 -->

done? If my mother were here, she would throw the
weight of her entreaty into the balance; and perhaps a
woman's pleading might turn it in our favor. In her
absence, what shall we do? Laura, can't you speak to him?
See if you can move him?"</p>

<p>Laura looked up with a most unaccountable coldness, and
an unwarrantable, though almost imperceptible, curl of the
lip, and said steadily:</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can say, Captain Lacy, to induce
you to remain?"</p>

<p>"Say that you desire it and advise it, Miss Sutherland,"
he said, eagerly, in a tone that failed notoriously in its
intended <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of nonchalance and trifling.</p>

<p>"I do desire it and advise it," Laura answered, quietly,
without raising her head again, but feeling Lawrence's
searching blue eyes on her face.</p>

<p>A few moments more of faintly urged objections and the
matter was ended, and Captain Lacy threw himself into his
easy-chair by the fire with undisguised satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You should rough it in a Canadian forest for a twelve-month, 
Mr. Sutherland," he said, "to appreciate the comforts 
of such a home as this; though I dare say you do not
undervalue it now."</p>

<p>"Alas! my good sir, I fear I am of the 'always-to-be-blessed' 
school. I acknowledge to finding a farmhouse a
lamentably slow abode at just my years. <i>Entre nous</i>, I'm
tired to death of doing nothing, and as my mother isn't
within hearing, I may venture to say, if there's any prospect
of business at Quebec, you may count on seeing me before
the opening of the spring campaign."</p>

<!-- page 310 -->

<p>"Thanks to the 8th of September, my dear sir, I am
afraid you'll find Quebec a duller place than this: Canada
is ours; Monsieur will never raise his head again there,
though he swears and gesticulates at a fearful rate, helpless
as he is. I feel the fun is over, and heartily wish we may
be ordered home before the spring opens. But it is a thousand 
pities, if you longed for action, that you did not set
your face northward a year ago. You would have seen a
glorious day, sir, if you had&mdash;a day worth twenty years' of
exposure, fatigue, and disappointment."</p>

<p>"Ah, if!" exclaimed Larry, impatiently, bringing his
hand down on the arm of has chair, resoundingly, "The
business of my life has been to miss opportunities; nothing
but the merest chance detained me at home. Two years
ago this autumn, I had every arrangement made for joining
the army&mdash;family matters alone stood in the way of my
plans."</p>

<p>"Alone!" repeated Warren. "It strikes me, Larry, it
must be a pretty loud call from king and country that
drowns the call of family in an honest man's ears. I do
not think you can reproach yourself for your decision; it
was love of adventure sacrificed to filial duty, and though
I've never had an opportunity of telling you before, let me
say, I have honored you for it, ever since I heard of the
occurrence."</p>

<p>"Ha! Master Parson, have you taken to fine speeches?
Upon my word, I thought better of you. I begin to suspect 
you wear the badge of one Ignatius Loyola somewhere 
beneath your garments. Reserve your praise till my
virtue is a little older; I won't do to swear by yet. Please

<!-- page 311 -->

heaven, I am off before two months are over to hunt
Cherokees in the Carolinas, sail before the mast to the West
Indies, or failing those occupations, to turn highwayman or
pirate. Anything to blow off the cobwebs."</p>

<p>"Anything to get rid of your duty, you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I mean, parson."</p>

<p>"Well, we will not quarrel, Larry; but you cannot
frighten me, I know you much too well."</p>

<p>"No, I'm hanged if you do!" cried Larry. "You're a
very decent fellow, and very clever, as parsons go, but you
haven't seen through me yet. Thunder! I shouldn't wonder 
if he'd put me down on his list with Steady and Rube,
under the head of hopeful."</p>

<p>"You give me credit, then, for a larger charity than I
deserve," said the young clergyman, quietly, but in a tone
that was quite divested of badinage. Warren never gave
the impression of being strait-laced and unbending; he
had not forsworn laughter, but his wit was held in strictest
curb, and never, even in the remotest degree, trenched on the
ground his office covered. The care of souls was too rigid
an employment to allow of much relaxation, and his relaxations, 
whenever he took them, must be most distinct from
that employment. No light or trifling word must ever be
admitted in connection with it; no foolish talking or jesting
ever be allowed to lower the sense of its importance in his
own mind or in the minds of others. It required a firm
and delicate hand to draw the line; but Warren's hand was
firm and delicate, and he drew it most correctly. If he had
been a man of the world from his youth, he could hardly
have had greater knowledge of the world than his intuitive

<!-- page 312 -->

perception of character gave him. Such clearness of sight
is apt to make a man keen, and cold, and sneering; but the
star of Warren Sutherland's heavenly wisdom had early
risen, high and pure above the lights of his earthly wisdom;
his faith had eclipsed his shrewdness, his charity had outgrown 
his wit, his earnestness had overtopped his mirthfulness.</p>

<p>"The only minister," as Captain Lacy had said to Lawrence 
that morning, after breakfast, through clouds of
smoke, "the only minister I ever saw who did not tell
funny stories about his brother ministers, and recount the
blunders of clerks, and choirs, and sextons."</p>

<p>"I like to see a man that has the sense to magnify his
office, or at least to dignify it," Larry answered. "Warren
Sutherland would have added consequence and strength to
anything he might have undertaken; he has undertaken
the greatest duty that a man can undertake, and he fills it
greatly."</p>

<p>Short, strong, and sudden, certainly; and he of the red
coat was not entirely sure he heard aright; it was a very
extraordinary sentiment to come from such a highhanded,
laughing, reckless, prodigal-son style of fellow as his young
host. But before he had rammed the idea through his
buckram and broadcloth, Larry was back again to commonplaces 
and he only remembered the remark that afternoon,
to wonder still more at the familiar disrespect with which
the young man treated the object of his veneration.</p>

<p>"Warren," he cried, snapping his handkerchief in Kelpie's 
eyes, who lay with her nose upon his boot, "Warren,
I was wondering, the other day, what you'd do with a huge

<!-- page 313 -->

fortune, if you had it. It was a question with me whether
you'd buy up and send home all the slaves in the British
dependencies, and enjoy the sight of a black streak of colonists 
all the way from here to Africa, or whether you'd get
communion-services and altar-cloths for all the English
churches in the colonies. I can't make out whether you
stake your hopes of salvation upon your churchmanship or
your philanthropy."</p>

<p>"Shall I say it has been equally a question with me
whether you most pride yourself upon your irreverence or
your insincerity?" said Warren.</p>

<p>"Why, no, I wouldn't have you say it," Lawrence returned, 
with a laugh, "for it might raise a doubt in my own
mind, and at present I am equally balanced about the matter 
of self-respect. I have no particular bias in favor of
either hypocrisy or heathenism, but grow both under the
same glass."</p>

<p>"Then I will not attempt to unsettle your complacency,"
said Warren, in a voice that was quite end-of-controversy
in its tone, though thoroughly well-bred and quiet. Lawrence 
accepted the edict, though he would not have
received it from any one else, and contented himself with a
wicked look of significance at him and another twist of
Kelpie's ears. Laura, commendably anxious to change the
theme, asked Captain Lacy, abruptly, if he had often books
from home, and if papers reached him regularly in
Canada.</p>

<p>"Very irregularly," Captain Lacy said. "I fear, Miss
Sutherland, I shall get very rusty in all that appertains to
letters. It is the worst feature of this business of expatriation. 

<!-- page 314 -->

One feels wretchedly lost, when one gets home, to
find even the children ahead of one in the literature of the
day. I have left strict orders to have all the periodicals
and new books of note forwarded to me, but I find I am
very indifferently supplied. Out of sight, out of mind, even
with booksellers, Miss Sutherland."</p>

<p>"If it only stopped with the booksellers!" said Laura,
half involuntarily.</p>

<p>"By the way," remarked Captain Lacy, "I have not
thought before to ask you of our friends at Briarfield and
Hiltonbury Park&mdash;do you hear often from them, and are
they well?"</p>

<p>"I do not hear very often," said Laura, looking down.
"They have been on the Continent this summer, and in
travelling, you know, one does not find much time for
letter-writing."</p>

<p>"How many regrets you must feel for that beautiful
Parsonage!" said Captain Lacy, with truly remarkable
awkwardness of judgment. "Into whose hands has it
passed?"</p>

<p>"It is unoccupied," Laura returned, in a low tone; and
Captain Lacy went on to recall his memories of it, and of
the church and neighborhood, while Warren sat looking
steadily and quietly into the fire, not expressing by look or
gesture the pain it gave him to hear that discussed which
even with Laura he did not dare fully to revive. After the
first shrinking in Laura's mind, however, there was a reaction; 
it became a delight to talk with one who knew and
admired those scenes so much, and who only remembered
them with pleasure, not as Warren did, to whom her most

<!-- page 315 -->

innocent recollection was a pang. Larry watched her
thoughtfully, as she was gradually drawn into the current
of reminiscence; she dropped her work from her hands,
and leant forward on her embroidery-frame, with a look
of animation on her face that he had never seen there before.</p>

<p>"Was not that a sweet morning," she said, forgetting
that she had any auditor but Captain Lacy, "the morning
of the archery meeting. I never shall forget it; the lawn
was so green and velvety, and the people were so gaily
dressed, and everything had such a festival look."</p>

<p>And the officer forgot he had any other auditor, as he
said in a low voice, "And the walk through the silver
birches."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Laura, "there are no such woods here
as the Hiltonbury woods. These vast forests are so strange,
so wild, I am half in awe of them. I shall never learn to
love them as I did the woods at home. The tangled underbrush 
and briery thickets give me a sense of desolation and
strangeness. I long to see the sunshine flicker down upon
the sward once more, and to catch glimpses of the sky
through the dark stems of English oaks! But I suppose
it's only because I am timid and foolish; I often think how
different it would be with Georgy. She used to drag me away
with her to a desolate old estate adjoining Hiltonbury,
where there was almost a primeval wilderness of beeches
and firs, and enjoy nothing more than the wildness and solitude 
of it, and the danger which my fears helped her to
believe in. She hated parks and pleasure-grounds, and
longed to be away from them all. But Georgy was always
impatient of home."</p>

<!-- page 316 -->

<p>"How great a contrast Miss Gregory formed to you!"
said Captain Lacy. "I have often thought of it. Do you
remember the morning after the archery ball, when I was
so happy as to be admitted to the library, where you and
she sat reading?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how well I remember that morning!" exclaimed
Laura, with lustrous eyes. "I was trying to make Georgy
read the 'Faerie Queen' and like it; but she could not;
she never seemed to understand it, even though she read it
so well. Don't you think she read very well, Captain
Lacy?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Miss Sutherland. It seemed to me she read
almost too impatiently, too rapidly; her thought ran before
her voice and left it to do its work alone. I noticed it
particularly when she read what she most admired, that
passage from 'Rasselas.' "</p>

<p>"Ah yes, I remember that; 'Rasselas' was just new, and
we had finished it only the week before. But is it not
strange, one with so strong feeling as Georgy and such a
fine fancy, should not love Spenser?"</p>

<p>"I remember," said Captain Lacy, "that she said of him,
she exhausted herself with disposing of his eccentricities
and reducing his metaphors to reason before she got at his
thought, and when she got it it was hardly worth the
pains. She had thought it herself, in common language,
half a dozen times."</p>

<p>"That was more than half perversity though, because
Warren and I liked it so much; but it was partly honesty;
purely imaginary works never gave her real pleasure, only
strong, stirring human things kindled her enthusiasm. She

<!-- page 317 -->

never would read my fairy books when we were children,
and stuck pins in the pictures of Christian in 'Pilgrim's
Progress' when her mother condemned her to it on Sunday
afternoons. Poor Georgy! I wonder if she wouldn't prefer
Allegory to Reality now!"</p>

<p>"Is she still at Briarfield, Miss Sutherland?" asked the
gentleman.</p>

<p>"No," faltered Laura, casting a frightened look toward
her brother, remembering for the first time what pain she
must have been inflicting, "I think&mdash;we heard&mdash;that is&mdash;she 
was to be married on the first of this month."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! Not to Sir Charles?"</p>

<p>Laura made a gesture of assent and bent over her work.</p>

<p>"I am surprised at that," went on the unconscious torturer. 
"I could not help seeing Sir Charles' devotion, short
as my stay at Borringdon was. But I thought her reception 
of it anything but indicative of hope for him. She
liked the love, but not the lover; and though I thought
time perhaps might wear her resistance out, I never could
have believed she would have sacrificed herself so soon."</p>

<p>"It did not surprise me. Captain Lacy," Laura said, in a
low tone. "I knew Georgy was ambitious."</p>

<p>" 'The infirmity of noble minds,' " he said. "Nevertheless, 
Miss Sutherland, does it seem to you in character for
Miss Gregory to marry her cousin, of whom she was always
sure, before she had tried the world at all, or received her
meed of homage, or indeed before she knew her own mind?
I cannot but be surprised at it; I thought there was too
much romance and self-will as well as worldly wisdom
about her; though perhaps she has suffered some reverse

<!-- page 318 -->

of fortune, some disappointment that has brought her to it
in desperation."</p>

<p>"No, none that I know of," Laura said sadly; but before
she had ended her sentence, the door closed after Warren,
and Lawrence, striding after him, would have left them to
the dreaded <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, had not Steady, who had stolen to
the window and was gazing longingly out into the snow,
exclaimed, startled out of her habitual decorum, by some
unusual apparition, "Oh, Miss Laura! oh, Master Lawrence! 
Look, look what's coming!"</p>

<p>And Lawrence, in no mood to be pleased with anything
that might come, and Laura, unable to think of anything
just then but the Hiltonbury coach in all its familiar and
well-remembered glory, turned away from the window after
their hurried glance out, with a disappointed "Oh! is
that all?"</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawrence</span> was a notoriously ungrateful rascal, or he
would never have said, "Is that all?" when he looked out
of the window, for he beheld Cicily van Hausen being
lifted from a mass of buffalo robes and blankets, by the
stout arms of Nick van Vechtin, and set upon her feet
inside the gate, upon the shovelled path that led to the front
door. Cicily looked as bright and pretty as possible as she
glanced coquettishly back upon the sleigh-load of youths and
maidens outside the gate, who cried out to her in Dutch
to make haste, and to whom she responded in the same
clumsy speech, that she should be just as long as ever she
could be. The horses shook their great jangling bells, the
youths and maidens laughed their merry, careless laughter,
the sun was just going down clear and golden, behind
the icy Catskills, leaving the vast white glittering lowlands 
still aglow; and all the scene, with Cicily, rosy-cheeked 
and bright-eyed, in the foreground, should have
struck Master Larry with delight and admiration. Instead
of which, he ground his teeth and swore an inoffensive
oath under his breath, and then met Cicily and Nick half-way 
down the path with a most hypocritical smile of
welcome.</p>

<!-- page 320 -->

"Quick, quick!" cried that imperious young beauty.
"Where's Miss Sutherland? We've come for her; we're
going over to Vrow van Bokkelin's&mdash;such splendid sleighing&mdash;there's 
two loads of us, and we're going to stop for
the Schunemans. Quick! don't waste time; they'll be out
of patience."</p>

<p>Lawrence saw in a moment how it stood; there was no
help for them, they must go; so after conducting the two
pioneers into the sitting-room, and enjoying Laura's blank,
overwhelmed speechlessness for one or two minutes, he
said: "Oh, well, we'll go, of course. Laura, you had
better wrap up well, only be quick."</p>

<p>"But, Lawrence, my aunt"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Nattee can do everything for her; you must go."</p>

<p>"But Warren may not want"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Warren will understand; there's no use in asking
him to go. Captain Lacy, there is a fur cloak at your service, 
but you are used to the cold. Nick, won't the rest
of 'em come in while Miss Sutherland is putting on her
wrappers?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Nick, sturdily. "They can't unpack
again."</p>

<p>Poor Laura gave a troubled glance out of the window at
the promiscuously packed sleigh-loads, and Lawrence's
heart was smitten with compassion for her.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Cicily," he said, "there isn't room enough
for three more people in either of those sleighs. Let them
drive on, and the men shall get the black nags before ours
in no time; you stay and go with us, and we'll overhaul
'em in less than a mile."</p>

<!-- page 321 -->

"Very well," said Cicily, contented with any arrangement 
that bestowed her upon Lawrence.

<p>"And Katrina?" murmured Laura, hesitatingly, full of the
haunting horror of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, "Will she not go with us?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Lawrence. "I'll go and see. Come,
Nick."</p>

<p>In marvellously quick time it was all effected; the spur
of Lawrence's strong will never was applied to better purpose; 
in ten minutes the black nags stood before the gate,
shaking their unaccustomed bells with more curiosity than
complacency, and jerking the narrow, high-backed sleigh
alarmingly with their spasmodic restlessness. Rube held
their heads with the hand of a master, while Lawrence
lifted Laura in, buried to the eyes in fur, then handed
Katrina to the seat beside her. Cicily sprang in and appropriated 
the front seat and seized the reins, while Captain
Lacy was condemned to that intermediate state which, in
old-fashioned sleighs, was no imaginary purgatory, being a
narrow, backless, uncushioned board, ordinarily consecrate
to such minors or servitors as were obliged to travel with
the family.</p>

<p>"Captain Lacy, I am afraid you have not a very comfortable 
seat," said Lawrence, looking back the first minute
that he could spare from the horses.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is most comfortable, Mr. Sutherland," 
returned the guest, seeing only that it was opposite
to Laura's.</p>

<p>The black ponies, famous alike for their ill-looks, bad
temper and good going, had put down their shaggy
heads, and were making telling use of their shaggy and

<!-- page 322 -->

uncouth legs. They were going like the wind&mdash;indeed, the
wind proper, of which there was not much, was at their
backs; enveloped in furs and wrappers as the party were,
it was impossible to feel the cold. Laura sank down in this
warm wealth of furs, and leaned her cheek against the protecting 
back of the sleigh, towering three feet in the air,
with the sensation of luxury and exhilaration that nothing
but sliding over the snow in a well-lined sleigh can give.
There is no other way of traversing</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"The land's lap or the water's breast"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

with so little motion, with such a swift sense of flight,
with such a magic smoothness. Boats have oars and paddles, 
or sails and ropes&mdash;must gibe and tack and luff and
reef; carriages, the easiest of them, bounce and joggle and
bump and tip, if the road is anything but adamant; nothing
save a sleigh can glide along for hours and hours without a
suggestion of the earth it passes over, with the swiftness of
flight, with the tranquillity of sleep, with utter luxury and
<i>abandon</i>.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down, and the sky was fast assuming
an evening tone, bright, still, about the horizon, but deepening 
and darkening toward the zenith, and right before
them, far in the north, hanging over their distant path,
came out a star, "with royal beauty bright," fabulously
fair and lustrous. Laura, gazing at it, felt as if it were
their destination, as if they would glide on&mdash;on to the
music of those low murmuring bells, till "starlight mingled
with the stars," and the vast, white plain of earth lay far
below them; a delicious dreaminess stole over her, from

<!-- page 323 -->

which she could not endure the thought of waking, Katrina, 
always dull, was thankful that she did not have to
talk, and Captain Lacy, gazing at Laura's fair, white,
dreamy face, found his pleasure in silence, too. If the
lovers beyond had voices, they were too low to reach them,
and on they flew, past fields of unsullied white, and groves
of icy-crested trees, and cottages covered with snow without, 
and twinkling with lights within; and more stars came
out, and the horizon grew dark blue like the upper sky, but
still the great north star shone in splendor, and still they
sped on through the night, directly in his very eye. Once
there came a jar, a confusion of conflicting sounds, as they
shot past their fellow voyagers, and were greeted with
shout and laugh and challenge. But soon the sounds died
away far behind them, and the charm asserted itself but
jarred, not broken. Laura wished it never might be
broken; she never wished to rouse from this enchantment.
The star seemed to grow brighter and nearer and then
further and fainter; one moment it seemed to stoop almost
within her grasp, at another it seemed to slide away&mdash;away&mdash;and, 
lapped in softest dreams, she slept.</p>

<p>"Laura, wake up! we're here."</p>

<p>"Where?&mdash;oh!" exclaimed Laura, roused by the rude
shock of pause, and impatient and fretful as a baby waked
by the stopping of his cradle's motion.</p>

<p>"You've been asleep behind there, I vow," cried Cicily,
springing out into the snow and tottering rather helplessly
into the path, as they paused before the gate of the Van
Bokkelin mansion.</p>

<p>"I don't know who has been asleep," said Laura, pettishly, 

<!-- page 324 -->

rubbing her eyes and trying to regain some familiar
sensation in her limbs that should assure her of their identity 
with the limbs she had left home with. But they were
so stiff and helpless and odd, and she felt so thoroughly
cross and chilly, that she could hardly answer Captain
Lacy civilly when he asked her if she was cold, and said
pettishly to Lawrence, when he came to lift her out of her
environment of fur,</p>

<p>"What place is this? What's the use of getting out?"</p>

<p>"No particular use, if you don't mind sitting out here
two or three hours in the cold, till the ponies are rested and
the people ready to go home."</p>

<p>Laura turned her head petulantly away and laid her cheek
against the fur; she was not more than half awake, and did
not feel more than ten years old. Captain Lacy was assisting 
Katrina to alight from the other side of the sleigh, so
Lawrence, sitting down on the edge of the seat, said deliberately, 
and as if he had all night before him:</p>

<p>"Well, Laura, what do you say? Shall I help you out,
or shall I tell the man to drive round to the barn?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," she said, twisting her head deeper in the
fur.</p>

<p>Lawrence, perhaps, had grown a little weaned from the
beauty and elegance and loveliness that was so far above
his reach,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Love's heroic strain<br/>

Had tired the heart and brought no gain,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>but now he stooped, eased and relieved, before this childish,
pouting change of mood, enslaved afresh, but desperately
reckless of his chains.</p>

<!-- page 325 -->

<p>"You don't care? Well, then, to the barn, Pompey."</p>

<p>He had the reins over one arm and with the other held
himself in the sleigh, sitting on the edge of it with his feet
in the snow. The sobered ponies started toward the barn,
the man leading them; at which motion Miss Laura started
up and said, "Stop! Oh, take me out!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" cried Larry, pulling up the horses, "I can
take you out, can I? Well, come, then."</p>

<p>He pushed aside the furs and lifted her in his arms. He
did not put her down upon the snow, but held his arm very
firmly round her as he strode toward the path, some distance 
down which the others stood waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Let me walk," murmured Laura hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Why can't I carry you? I've carried you before, you
know."</p>

<p>His face was so close to hers she heard him, husky and
low and strange as his voice was, but she did not try to
answer him.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you are awake now!" cried Cicily, with a
spiteful sting in her voice, as Lawrence placed Laura in the
path and approached them. Yes, Laura was awake, most
thoroughly awake, though she answered rather low, and
started forward to the side of Captain Lacy and Katrina
hurriedly and confusedly.</p>

<p>"Larry, you and Cicily go first and meet the vrow;
see, the door is opening," cried Katrina, pushing her
younger sister forward. Cicily naturally took precedence
of her sisters when there was any speaking to be done;
the "you're-a-scholar" feeling always prompted them to

<!-- page 326 -->

shrink behind her, and her unwavering sense of superiority
always prompted her to take the lead.</p>

<p>Vrow van Bokkelin was a big, broad-faced, loud-voiced,
good-natured matron, always ready to further the wishes
of "the young folks," always ready to turn the house inside
out for their amusement, and the very one, in short, to be
surprised agreeably by a descent of thirty hungry pleasure-seekers 
at an unheard-of hour of night. She had no children 
of her own worth mentioning; a lank, shy, unmanageable 
son, who always took to the attic when there was
company, and a peaked little girl of nine, who generally hid
in her mother's skirts and cried when anybody spoke to her.
The good man of the house was one of those chimney-corner 
saints who always marry big women and lead uncomplaining 
lives of servitude; though, as he was well-clothed
and well-fed in return for his services, and was under a
thrifty rule, perhaps, according to the laws of natural justice, 
he had nothing to complain of.</p>

<p>"Vail noo, vail noo, 'dis is goote!" cried the vrow,
standing open-armed in the door, followed by a wondering
train of swarthy retainers. "Cicily van Hausen and Larry
Sutherland! Vail noo, vail noo, I knew you'd come; I've
been a lookin' for you all de day."</p>

<p>And she folded Cicily to her capacious bosom before the
latter could deliver herself of her intended speech. Indeed,
Vrow van Bokkelin did not require much of her guests beyond 
a wide power of receptivity.</p>

<p>"And dis is de pretty girl from England, ish it? Oh
my, oh my, how white she ish! Come in, come in, my
dear; I'm glad to see ye. And here's Katrina! Vall noo

<!-- page 327 -->

Katrina, it dosh me goote to see ye. Where's Nick, eh?
Comin'? Ah, vell, he von't pe long pehind you, I know
dat. And dis is a strange gentleman as I don't know at all;
vell, dat's no matter, sir, I'm glad to see you jis the same,
jis the same. Come in all, come in all; dere's a goote fire
noo, and dere'll be a goote supper before long. Des lazy
winches, noo! Stir yourselves and get de fires a blazin';
be quick! be quick! light de big lamp and snuff de candles;
des folks am frozed, I know."</p>

<p>And talking loudly and unceasingly, and hovering as
many of the stranger brood as she could gather under her
broad wings, she led them into the family room, where they
were met by a meek greeting from a thin man at the fireside, 
and by the hasty bang of a side-door, through which
they caught a glimpse of a retreating pair of cowhide boots
and the flutter of a flying coat-tail. There certainly was a
glorious and hospitable fire upon the hearth, and light and
warmth and supper enough got up to have sufficed for the
entertainment of the whole country side, before the last
detachment arrived. Such greetings, such laughing, such
noise! Laura tried not to look strange or uncomfortable,
though, indeed, it did not make much difference how any
body looked. The hospitable hostess did not stop to see
what impression her hospitality produced upon her guests,
but bustled and scolded and welcomed and questioned all
in the same breath, and without expecting any result or
waiting for any answer.</p>

<p>Most of the entertained were accustomed to the manner
of their entertainer, but it quite appalled the English strangers, 
who could hardly recover themselves enough to talk

<!-- page 328 -->

to each other. It was even worse when they sat down to
supper. Fate (for no one else had any hand in the arrangement 
of the visitors at the board) threw Laura between
Nick van Vechtin and Katrina van Hausen, both blessed
with the most unloverlike and undainty appetites, and both
most anxious for the temporal well-being of the young
stranger. They urged vociferously upon her the strange,
uncouth, unsavory Dutch dishes which were their own especial 
favorites, and made her quite faint with the prodigality
and persistency of their attentions. Accustomed to the farmer-like 
profusion, but substantial elegance of her uncle's
table, thoroughly English in its style and tone, she was entirely 
bewildered by this first glimpse at Dutch farm-life.
"Is this the sort of life Cicily van Hausen leads?" she pondered; 
"can it be that Larry finds her in such a home as
this? The love must be pretty strong that reconciles him."</p>

<p>But there is a great deal in familiarity with repulsive
things: after the supper-table was cleared away from the
floor and the chairs pushed back against the wall, and the
negro fiddler summoned, Laura's shyness began to thaw
considerably; she became acclimated to the loud tones of
the vrow, and the noisy manners of the young women, and
began to think that, after all, they were very good-natured,
and perhaps at heart as modest as the ladies to whose society 
she had been accustomed. They were very pretty, too,
some of them. The Van Hausens were, par excellence, the
belles, but there were, besides them, several strikingly fine
pieces of flesh and blood, all of the Dutch type, but varied
considerably by English intermixtures. They were all,
however, quite as shy of her as she was of them, and much

<!-- page 329 -->

less graceful in the expression of their feelings. The youths,
who evidently regarded her as a marvel of beauty and unapproachableness, 
were rendered unspeakably <i>gauche</i> by
their admiration, and most of them let her alone altogether,
and kept as far out of the way as possible. She was quite
ignorant of their approval, however, and of the envious
wonder of the young fraulein, so her manner did not lose
its pretty timidity and unconscious humbleness, which
formed, perhaps, her principal charm.</p>

<p>There was something in the thought of dancing, no
matter to what music and with what spectators, quite
exhilarating to one so long exiled from pleasure, and Laura
found herself actually happy when she accepted Captain
Lacy's hand for a reel, and took her place upon the floor.
Profiting by the experience of the previous evening, the
military hero was much more humble and unassuming, and
soon showed his really good dancing and ready faculty of
imitation.</p>

<p>"Miss Sutherland," he whispered, after the first set,
"you will not dance with any of these&mdash;these persons;
promise me that. Let me be your partner."</p>

<p>"If you choose," she said, with a brighter smile than any
he had had before. Lawrence, coming to her side that
moment, said in a low tone, "Laura, I want you to dance
with me this one reel."</p>

<p>Lawrence's manner had been different from his habitual
easy one all the evening. He had been silent and moody,
interesting himself little with the amusements going on,
talking with no one but his frightened, meek-looking host,
and watching the dancing silently by his side.</p>

<!-- page 330 -->

<p>"A quarrel with Cicily," was Laura's interpretation.</p>

<p>"A jealous fit about the red-coat," was Cicily's reading.</p>

<p>"The deuce is to pay with young mine host!" thought
Captain Lacy.</p>

<p>"He's such a thundercloud, he'd turn milk by looking
at it once," the damsels whispered, and the swains indorsed,
but none dared rate him, or amuse themselves at his
expense in any but the lowest tone. Whatever the cause
of his mood, however, it was evidently a vindictive and
unapproachable one, and Laura, not at all strong-minded
nor at all strong-nerved, made her refusal to dance with
him in a very uncertain and frightened voice. Captain
Lacy had gone away for a moment, to be devoured by his
hostess, who had just learned he was a hero fresh from the
French war, and Lawrence, leaning back in his place
against the wall, looked down with folded arms and lowering 
brow upon his cousin, who stood playing with the
ribbons of her stomacher, and looking as if she longed to
have him go away.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will come for you to dance the next
dance with me after this."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I promised," and then she stopped and
blushed.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;did you say you promised?" he asked, stooping
his head, and speaking in a most uncomfortable voice,
Laura glanced around miserably to see if no one were
at hand to help her out of this, but Captain Lacy was not
in sight at all, and all the rest were as far off as they could
get conveniently, so she faltered, "Captain Lacy," and
then her cousin strode away, and left her standing all alone

<!-- page 331 -->

and perfectly wretched. What had she done; what should
she do? If he only would come back, she would dance
forty reels with him, and do exactly anything he told her.
But he was gone; she and Cicily both watched the door in
vain for his return, and the pleasure of the evening was
over for both of them.</p>

<p>Not until the revellers, cloaked and hooded, stood in the
hall ready to depart, did he make his appearance. It was
curious to note the different effect of the occurrence upon
the two women most interested in it. Cicily was flashingly, 
tempestuously piqued and angry, Laura was quiet
as a statue, with a shade of anxiety and wistfulness upon
her face however, not often expressed in marble. She slid
from the embrace of the great vrow with a noiseless
evasiveness, and hurried down the path. The Sutherland
sleigh stopped the way, but Cicily was there before her,
coquetting most audaciously with the military gentleman,
and asserting that she would ride inside, come what might.
Katrina was already comfortable in her former corner, and
as there was no one to contradict Miss Cicily, of course she
had her own way and her rival's place.</p>

<p>Laura stood undetermined a moment, while Captain
Lacy urged her taking the middle seat, and not exposing
herself to the cold wind by riding with Larry, and
Larry stood waiting in a most indifferent do-as-you-please
way.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" she said, hesitatingly looking from
one to the other. "I don't mind the wind, and the front
seat's more comfortable."</p>

<p>"It's much colder than when we came, Miss Sutherland."</p>

<!-- page 332 -->

<p>"But I am so wrapped up, and I like to be where I can
see the horses."</p>

<p>A moment more, and she was reigning in Cicily's vacated
place, but to all appearance, rather a triste young queen.
After they were fairly under weigh, Larry vouchsafed not
more than a sentence per mile on an average, and that on
no suggestive or productive plan.</p>

<p>The moon had come out excellently bright, but the star
was at their back, and all the dreaminess and magic had
gone with the sight of it. But if the companions outside
had nothing to entertain each other with but jealousy and
anger and reserve, those inside were "jolly companions
every one," and were making the most of each other.
Cicily was wild with fun and spirits, real or assumed,
Katrina, even, was waked to jollity, and Captain Lacy fell
readily into the prevailing mood. Fag ends of their jokes
strayed on to those in front, and Laura turned often, half
curious to know what made them so vociferously merry, but
either from pique or absent-mindedness, they were oblivious 
of an outside circle, and confined their merriment
within themselves.</p>

<p>It was a long, long ride; how long, none knew so well as
Laura. She did not feel sleepy now&mdash;so far from it, she
wondered how she could have slept before. She was cold,
too, and tired, and a great deal more than that. Every
burst of laughter from the party behind her, made her
uncomfortable in one way, and every stolen glance at
Larry's stubborn face beside her, made her wretched in
another. The very glitter of the moonbeams and the
music of the bells were all so many torments and discomforts.

<!-- page 333 -->

How strange the woods and rocks looked! Was
it possible she could have slept all this way before, or
did it look so differently by starlight, or was it another
road?</p>

<p>"How many miles have we come?" she could not help
asking of Larry at last, in a very weary tone.</p>

<p>"About fourteen, I think," he said, glancing carelessly
around to see his whereabouts.</p>

<p>"And it is nineteen from the Van Bokkelins' to the
Flats?"</p>

<p>"Yes, nearly twenty."</p>

<p>An involuntary, irrepressible sigh escaped her. "You're
tired," he said, looking down at her.</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"You'll be much more comfortable inside. I'll stop the
horses and put you over there."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," very shortly, and they went on in
more solemn silence than before. By and by, however,
they approached a turn in the road, around which the wind
whistled pretty strongly, and Laura put her head down in
the furs.</p>

<p>"You'd better take my advice," said Larry, laconically.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Laura, with a flash of spirit which perhaps 
the young gentleman had not fully expected. He
drew up the reins very suddenly, and Laura, turning
around, said quickly:</p>

<p>"Captain Lacy, it <i>is</i> cold out here; may I change my
mind?"</p>

<p>"<i>&Agrave; la bonne heure!</i>" cried the gentleman, starting forward 
with empressement, and speaking in French and

<!-- page 334 -->

quickly. "Have you punished me enough, Miss Sutherland?"</p>

<p>"I have not punished any one but myself," she returned,
in the same language, manifestly embarrassed.</p>

<p>Now Cicily did not know French, but the gentleman's
tone was one which nobody at all familiar with the language 
of flirtation could misunderstand, and she felt herself
bitterly ill-used at such a requital of all her pains. For
fourteen miles she had lavished smiles upon him, and this
was the return he made her. The very instant Laura condescended 
to address him, he was back at her feet again
more devoted than before. When she got tired of Larry,
forsooth she called the captain again! It must not be
supposed Cicily kept her temper; a serener girl would have
lost hers under such a trial.</p>

<p>Larry said "whoa" several times very emphatically, but
the ponies did not whoa at all, and then he stood up, and
gave them more emphasis in connection with his whiplash.
At length they seemed to acknowledge his authority, however, 
and with many shakings of their bells, and after
much uneasy motion of their shaggy feet, they stood
comparatively still. The spot they had chosen for their
momentary halt, certainly was not a happily chosen one.
The road they were travelling then was not the one by
which they had gone to the Van Bokkelins', but a by-road,
into which Lawrence had turned after Laura's weary-toned
question. It was shorter by two miles than the highway,
but rough and uncertain at all times, and doubly so with a
foot and a half of snow over it, and the track perfectly
unbeaten. But Larry was of fearless blood, and in a

<!-- page 335 -->

reckless mood. He had driven all sorts of horses over all
sorts of roads at all sorts of hours, and had never broken
his own neck, nor the necks of any of those intrusted to
him. The thought of Laura's discomfort was insupportable 
to him in just his present mood, and he was so
thoroughly desperate, his good judgment suffered a
temporary eclipse, and he turned doggedly into the
dangerous road, with the unwise confidence that he would
get out of it "somehow," and no doubt it would all come
out right.</p>

<p>Nothing was further from its intention, however. The
road where they had stopped wound around the base of
the mountain; above them, on the right, was an unbroken
forest; below them, on the left, descending sharp down
from the road, was a deep ravine, where a clearing had
been lately made, and where the gaunt trees, still standing,
threw gaunter shadows on the snow beneath. Some brushwood 
and logs lay on the edge of the road a hundred
yards beyond the present-stopping place, and at these
phenomena, in their envelopment of white, the ponies were
casting fearful glances, and were moving their ears to and
fro with apprehensive nervousness. Larry cast a glance at
them that was not without apprehension, but "guessed
he could do it," so planting his feet firmly, he drew the
reins over his arm, held his hands out to Laura, and was
just helping her over the seat, when Cicily, with some
saucy preface, burst into a ringing laugh.</p>

<p>That was just all that was needed. The half timid, half
vicious brutes gave a violent start, then, before Larry could
recover the reins, plunged forward, swinging the sleigh
after them, and throwing Larry forward with Laura on his

<!-- page 336 -->

arm, upon the seat. A cry burst from the frightened girls
in the rear, and a deep imprecation from the lips of the
helpless driver, who struggled in vain to recover the reins,
realizing more than his companions, the dangers upon
which they were rushing, and realizing, too, most fully, his
utter helplessness. He was supporting Laura with his
right hand; if he withdrew that, in her present position,
the next sudden motion of the sleigh would throw her out,
and very little progress he naturally made in getting the
mastery of the fiery horse flesh in front of them with his
left hand, entangled and impeded at that. Laura gave one
fearful look ahead at the horses, with their ears laid back,
their necks strained forward, and then she shut her eyes
and lay quite still.</p>

<p>What a horrible moment of suspense and silence, as they
dashed forward&mdash;choked, stifled, paralyzed with fear;
nothing to be done but to wait for whatever might be
coming&mdash;to meet their fate, whatever it might be&mdash;their 
lives at the mercy of those devil-ridden beasts. It
seemed hours instead of minutes. Then there came a
sudden lunging of the sleigh to the right, the sharp
branch of an over-hanging tree struck heavily on Larry's
arm, and with an exclamation of pain he relaxed his hold
for an instant. Only for an instant, but before he could
regain it, the sleigh was swung violently back to the other
side of the road, and with a jar and wrench that made all
things swim before her, and turn black, Laura found herself
lying half-buried in the snow upon the edge of the precipice, 
just tottering on the very brink, while down the road
beyond, she caught the last glimpse of the fleet sleigh, and
heard the last jangle of the receding bells. It was an

<!-- page 337 -->

appalling sensation, the ghastly solitude of the silence that
fell after the jar and shock of being hurled away from the
flying sleigh.</p>

<p>Midnight in the wilderness! How Laura's heart died in
her at the thought: alone, in such a spot, and with such
fears for her companions; no longer at the mercy of those
living furies, but at the mercy of terrors hardly less
appalling. How long should she be there alone? Her
companions might not live to return for her; it was miles
out of the highway; there was no chance of any passers-by;
the night was bright and still, but growing colder every
minute, such a deadly cold&mdash;dumb, deep, penetrating.
The breath froze on the muff against her face, almost
before it left her lips, and the snow on which her bare
wrist pressed, first stung, then numbed it instantly. She
was so stiff and chilled, and so encumbered with wrappings
that she could hardly move; why should she move?
There was no use, she could reach no one; then came an
impulse to bury her face in her muff and keep it from the
cold, and lie still just where she was, and then the thought
darted suddenly through her mind of what she had heard
of death by freezing&mdash;of the horrible, insidious sleepiness&mdash;and 
with a pang of fear she started up and tried to regain
her feet.</p>

<p>But that sudden start was the fatal move; the snow on
which she had been lying was just toppling over the
ravine, her hasty movement had broken the frozen crust,
and it was giving way. She uttered a terrified shriek, and
grasped at the nearest twig, it broke in her hand; she
caught the next, but it was iced all over, and it bent and

<!-- page 338 -->

slipped treacherously through her fingers. It was all
slipping&mdash;slipping down slowly, surely. She looked at the
bank above, and it was growing further off; when she
reached out despairingly at the bushes, she found she was
passing them, and was going down&mdash;down&mdash;stealthily and
steadily. She could not pray, nor cry, nor think&mdash;a most
magnified bodily fear, a helpless, half-senseless shrinking, a
cowering animal dread, paralyzed imagination during
those intense minutes of suspense. There was a creaking,
crackling sound for an instant, as the miniature avalanche
detached itself finally from the embankment, and then the
motion grew quicker and quicker, and in another moment&mdash;it 
had leaped down into the ravine below.</p>

<p>The horrible stifling sense of falling, and the stunning
shock of meeting earth after such a fall, even earth
smothered and muffled in a thick snow, took away her
breath and consciousness at first. When at length, however, 
she began bewilderedly to ponder and wonder and
remember, and in consternation to look about her, it was
to feel first a dull pain from a blow upon her temple, and
then to realize that she was lying, otherwise unhurt, upon a
drift of snow, not three feet from a pile of jagged rocks,
and almost within touch of a giant beech tree, whose stiff
and naked branches stretched above her head. Many
trees stood about at irregular distances, and several huge
felled trunks showed the recent clearing; but over these
the snow spread white and smooth, and through the naked
branches, the clear, full moon shone down, almost with the
light of day.</p>

<p>But what a frozen, petrified silence! Not a sound, not

<!-- page 339 -->

a motion&mdash;no wind among the icy trees, no murmuring of
the arrested rill, no shivering of the taper icicles that hung
from the sides of the ravine; nothing but a ghastly,
unearthly, freezing stillness, that seemed to creep into
her very soul. She tried to raise herself, and look about
for help, but dulled, and faint, and weary, she sank back
and shut her eyes. Then came the fear about the sleepiness, 
but this time fainter and more familiar, and she tried
to rouse herself, and to remember about it and keep
awake. She said her prayers, the words of them, at least,
over and over again, and tried to mean them, and to grasp
their sense, but it seemed floating from her, drifting
beyond her reach, and she caught earnestly at it, and
roused herself, and then sunk back into forgetfulness again
before she had attained it.</p>

<p>How cold the snow beneath her felt! Fine, thin veins
of chill ran through her frame&mdash;she longed to get up, but
she lacked the power: she tried to resist the torpor, but
she felt it gathering over her: duller, and dimmer, and
more helpless her will grew every moment. She was so
tired, there was nothing sweeter than rest, no matter what
came after it; she was so sleepy, there was nothing better
than sleep, even if it never ended.</p>

<p>And that treacherous peace stole the last tinge of rose
from the cheek that lay "snow on snow" in the silent
ravine, and drove the reluctant blood slowly in from the
faint, chill veins. The still moonbeams played over the
shrouded blue of her eyes, and glittered mockingly upon
her pale, fixed lips: there would be little left, in two hours
more, for death itself to do,</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">PERTINAX'S CABIN.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">"He who wants least is most like the gods, for they want nothing.""</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rev. Pertinax Pound was not a light sleeper; being
a vigorous walker and an early riser, having the appetite
of a day-laborer and the digestion of a school-boy, he rarely
misapplied the hours appointed for repose, and upon few
nights failed to read the book of oblivion from cover to
cover, and to rise renewed and refreshed from its perusal
in the morning. He never felt the dreariness of his dingy
cabin, for he knew little of it but by daylight; it resounded
in the early evening to his sonorous praying, then, until the
early morning, to his no less sonorous snoring; it knew
much more of him for those ten hours than he knew of it.
But the night after the snow-storm formed an exception to
the general rule, the old man had gone to bed early, and,
during the first half of it, had needed no narcotic. A little
after midnight, however, either increasing cold, or some
unusual state of body, had rendered him restless and wakeful; 
he wooed Sleep in vain, and finally resolved he would
have none of the coy wench even if she chose to come, but
would pay his court to her easier sister, Warmth. Easy
she was not on that night, however. He got up and put
on his clothes, but, tough old woodsman as he had esteemed

<!-- page 341 -->

himself he found them insufficient to procure him anything
like comfort.</p>

<p>"Winter's here and no mistake," he muttered, as he
walked uneasily around. "Either I'm getting old, or it's
an awful night, one or both."</p>

<p>He rubbed the frost-work off the little pane of glass that
formed his window, and said involuntarily: "God ha'
mercy on the men or beasts abroad to-night."</p>

<p>There was no sound without to prompt him to do it, but
he unbolted the narrow door, and stepping out, looked up
and down the road. The full moon was shining on it
almost with the brilliancy of noonday, everything lay
as silent and peaceful as death. The great black shadows 
of the trees behind the house stretched across the
snow like dumb and solemn mourners; no wind wooed
them, and no sound, however faint, stirred the clear air,
which cut like a knife, for all its clearness and repose,
and the old man drew in with a shiver and shut the
door.</p>

<p>"Give me a good, honest blow," he muttered, "from
any two o' the four quarters o' heaven, and a drenchin'
rain to boot, or even a peltin' hail, before ye give me sich
a night as this, stingin' like a serpent, and lookin' peaceful
as a sleepin' baby. There's death in its breath; it has an
uncanny feel in my nostrils, somehow."</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to build a fire; it grieved
him sore to yield to such an effeminacy, and he stood it
out stoutly for some time, slapping his hands together and
walking up and down the narrow cabin to keep his blood
astir, but at last he succumbed to a warning twinge of

<!-- page 342 -->

rheumatism in his left shoulder, and in a few moments a
great fire was blustering up the chimney.</p>

<p>"Aha!" ejaculated Mr. Pound with ineffable satisfaction,
as he drew up his rush-bottomed chair before the fire, and
planted his feet on the uneven hearth. "Aha!" It was
comfort enough for awhile to sit and thaw before it and
realize its abounding excellence, and by and by he reached
down the sad-colored Bible from the shelf in the corner,
and opening it on his knees, stooped down to see if he
could not read it by the blaze. A much finer print and a
much less familiar text would have been readable by the
light of those well-seasoned hickory logs, and leaning forward, 
with the book between his knees and his elbows
resting on them, he began to read aloud, moving his finger
along the page. It is probable he had never assumed the
possibility of reading in any other way, and that he was
firmly settled in the belief that the proper understanding
of any written form of words required the active exercise 
of three of the five senses bestowed upon the human
species.</p>

<p>The book opened of itself to Isaiah; there was a grand,
rough spirit of poetry deep down in the old man's soul,
that made him love that book beyond the rest of Holy
Writ, and the constant reading of it had given to his rude
speech a sort of majestic rhythm that was very foreign
to his station or education. He did not read it with any
view to its study or elucidation, simply for his own delight
and comfort; he did not in the least understand it prophetically 
or historically, but received it all as a purely
personal communication. Its denunciations were hurled

<!-- page 343 -->

at his enemies, its pleadings were addressed to his flock,
its promises were made to him, "As manna," says Donne,
"tasted to every man like that he liked best, so do the
Psalms minister instruction and satisfaction to every man
in every emergency and occasion." Parson Pound loved
the Psalms, too, but the Prophet Isaiah was his manna, his
daily food. There was not quite enough of the <i>anathema
maranatha</i> spirit in the songs of the sweet Psalmist of
Israel to make them entirely satisfactory upon all his emergencies 
and occasions; besides, the church he hated read
them daily in her services, but she had no exclusive right
in the majestic Prophet.</p>

<p>The sympathy that the last night's interview with Nattee
had aroused, had by no means lessened since he had had
time to think her story over. Her bitter resentment
jumped with his mood so entirely, he had brooded over
her wrongs till he had worked himself quite beyond her
pitch of wrath. The slaveholding, arrogant, popish-tending
Sutherlands had long represented the enemies of the Lord
in his readings of the Bible; sometimes he even inserted
their name into the text, and now, to-night, as he stooped
over the tattered leaves and made out the stirring words
of the Prophet by the red blaze of the firelight, repeating
the familiar words with strong and vivid emphasis, he
stopped more than once and looked around, startled at
the living, awful way in which the words seemed to fill the
cabin and echo about him, even when he paused.</p>

<p>"Surely, that was some one spoke," he said, at last, getting 
up and walking to the window; but no, all lay still
as death about his isolated little habitation, and drawing

<!-- page 344 -->

up his clumsy chair again before the fire, he muttered,
as he seated himself, stooping down and turning over the
leaves:</p>

<p>"Fear and snare and the pit are upon thee, O inhabitant 
of the earth. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, 
and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,
and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the
day of the Lord shall be upon every one that is proud and
lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be
brought low . . . . And the Lord alone shall be exalted in
that day."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and lifted his head, for a
strange distant sound penetrated the walls of the cabin.
What could be stirring at this hour of night? He listened
long, and then, hearing nothing, resumed his interrupted
reading, laying his broad hand on the page for which he
had been seeking, and repeating more from memory than
sight, the fifty-first chapter. He had nearly reached the end
of it, his voice rising with the terror and beauty of which it
is full.</p>

<p>"These two things are come unto thee, who shall be
sorry for thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine
and the sword; by whom shall I comfort thee? Thy sons
have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild
bull in a net; they are full of the fury of the Lord, the
rebuke of thy God;"&mdash;&mdash;when against the door there came
a sudden jar, as of some one falling on it, and an indistinct
cry or groan. The old man put aside his book, and started
up, hurrying to the door in amazement and alarm; drawing
the bolt he pulled it open abruptly, and across the threshold

<!-- page 345 -->

fell the senseless body of a girl, while prostrate on the stone
behind her lay a man fainting and half dead, with a gash
across his forehead, from which the blood streamed fresh
from his heavy fall; and the minister started back with a cry
of consternation as, trying to rise, in the livid face upturned
he recognized Lawrence Sutherland. Raising his hand with
a gesture of supplication, he murmured:</p>

<p>"Take her in, for the love of heaven&mdash;see if you can save
her."</p>

<p>And Pertinax, speechless with astonishment, stooped over
her and lifted her in his arms. "Poor child, poor child!"
he murmured as her icy hand fell back on his, "I said it
was an awful night."</p>

<p>He laid her on the rough settle that answered for his
bed, and dragged it back from the fire, throwing open the
door, and heaping ashes on the flames, and then, with a
sorrowful and little-hoping charity, he bent over her and
rubbed her slender fingers between his own rough palms.
By this time Lawrence had staggered into the house, and
supporting himself against the bed, was trying to undo the
fastenings of her cloak, while the old man, laying down the
pretty hand, with a hopeless shake of the head moved across
the room, saying:</p>

<p>"My poor fellow, you had better take thought for your
self; let me get you a glass o' such wine as I have, and lay
ye down and rest."</p>

<p>Lawrence ejaculated earnestly, stretching out his hand
in entreaty:</p>

<p>"Leave me alone, only think of her. I tell you, man," he
went on passionately, "she must&mdash;she shall live&mdash;there is

<!-- page 346 -->

no mercy nor justice in Heaven if she cannot&mdash;this is but
a swoon&mdash;come back to her&mdash;help her, old man. Save her,
for you can&mdash;I, I am past it. Oh, merciful Heaven! that
my strength should give way now, when a few minutes
more"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And with a groan he sank down fainting, while a livid,
death-like look came over his features.</p>

<p>"As a wild bull in a net," muttered the old man, going
across the room and glancing back at the prostrate form,
powerless and inanimate, with the words of defiance and
rebellion hardly cold upon his lips. " 'The lofty looks of man
shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed
down.' There is justice in Heaven, poor sinner. I pray
there may be mercy too!"</p>

<p>There was nerve and promptness in all his movements
now; both the sufferers thrown upon his care equally
needed him, and though he had little hope for one, he left
no means untried for the restoration of either, going about
his work none the less effectually that his lips moved in
half-audible prayer the while. He brought out a glass of
some strong liquor and poured it down Lawrence's throat,
then wet the pale lips of the girl with the same, and rubbed
her temples with it. The fastenings of her cloak, that had
resisted poor Larry's agonized attempts, yielded to his
steadier hand, and nothing was left to stifle or impede the
breath that he prayed might once more flutter through
those silent lips. But the heart seemed as silent, too;
he put his ear down to listen at the white still breast
in vain; if it yet beat, it was audible only to nicer ears than
his.</p>

<!-- page 347 -->

"God help the poor thing!" he muttered, folding his own
cloak over her; "I doubt I shall be able to coax her back
again. Most like she's better off than we; it's no great
charity to balk her of her rest. She looks as if she belonged 
to Heaven now."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, however, he in no wise remitted
his exertions; the few restoratives that were at his command 
he applied with vigor and discretion, and with the
animation of a more eager hope than he acknowledged
to himself. Hard old Puritan as he was, he could not
look on those white limbs, and not grudge Death such a
lovely prey; there was a magic in the pureness and beauty of
the lifeless form before him, that even softened his heart toward 
the errors of the man for whom he would save her,
if saved she could be; he almost forgot Nattee and her
burning wrongs, while he chafed Laura's slender hand, or
listened breathlessly for the beating of her heart, and then
glanced down at the baffled and humbled lover, unconscious
at her feet.</p>

<p>"It's hard," he thought "and they both so young and
both so fair and full o' life. God ha' mercy this one time,
and spare her a little longer!"</p>

<p>Pertinax had left the tenderest and best love of his
heart buried with his only daughter under the sod of a
distant New England churchyard, and perhaps that memory 
helped his Christian charity and his general philanthropy 
in the earnest labors of that long night&mdash;for
a long night of suspense and anxiety it proved, and it
was not until dawn had begun to streak the gloom of
the eastern sky that, lifting himself up from his anxious

<!-- page 348 -->

vigil, he made a sign of hope to Lawrence, who leaned
against the wall below the couch, and ejaculated, "Thank
God!"</p>

<p>And "Thank God!" Lawrence's white lips seemed to
echo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> weeks had passed since Larry Sutherland drove the
black ponies home from the Van Bokkelins, by way of Chalford's 
Clearing, and a longer two weeks, according to that
young gentleman's estimate of time, had never been recorded. 
Of the first part of it he knew comparatively little,
just as little, in fact, as people ever know of the employment
of their time and the occupation of their thoughts, during
a high fever and a strong delirium. But after those had
worn off, and he began to recover enough to be perfectly
wretched, and to realize he had a dislocated shoulder and a
gashed forehead, and sprains and bruises innumerable to be
taken care of, the days grew to be most spun out and endless 
affairs, and the nights most interminable penances.</p>

<p>Patience, as has been hinted, was not the virtue on which
Larry's friends staked their hopes of his canonization; but
those who now attended him began to think he possessed

<!-- page 350 -->

more of it than they had given him credit for. Nattee
wondered secretly at his silent ways, and his poor mother
blessed him in her credulous and tender heart for his submission: 
his father rarely came to his apartment, but when
he did, it was to marvel at his cowed and spiritless behaviour; 
while Warren only saw with fear the sullenness and
gloom they all mistook for submissiveness of temper. He
had been in no real danger after the fever yielded; there was
nothing for him to do but to keep quiet while the work of
restoration and renovation went on of itself. As skillful
doctoring as the country and the times afforded, and as tender 
nursing and devoted care as any country or any time
could have afforded, had been lavished on him, and at the
end of a week there was, as has been said, nothing left for
him to do but to get well. It ought to have been, and
doubtless was, much consolation to him to know that his companions 
in misfortune had been even more lightly dealt with
than himself. His first eager, half-trembling inquiry, after
his delirium had subsided, had been for news of his cousin.
Nattee happened to be the person watching by him when
he roused and asked the question. Miss Laura? Oh, Miss
Laura was very well now; she had come down to dinner
for the first time yesterday; she was looking a little pale,
but was a great deal better.</p>

<p>Had she been in to see him, or was it a dream he had
had of her standing below the bed there, looking at him
Larry asked.</p>

<p>"You must ha' been dreamin'. Master Larry," Nattee
said quickly, glancing sideways at him as she spoke, "But

<!-- page 351 -->

I can call Miss Laura, if you want her. She's in the
sitting-room wi' Captain Lacy, fixing the bandage on his
wrist. She'll come in a minute, I know, Master Larry, if
you want her."</p>

<p>"I do not want her," Larry said, quickly and huskily
and Nattee shrunk back, half frightened at what she had
done, half triumphant at her unlooked-for success. The
devil, they say, puts the ace, king and queen into a beginner's 
hand, and some such policy seemed to obtain with
whatever leader Nattee's course of deception was beginning 
under. She hardly dared hope her rude and unpractised 
net could have a chance of insnaring, when she found
her master entangled in it, and the way open for more and
more vital play. Few could have resisted such an easy sin&mdash;least 
of all, poor untaught, passion-led Nattee, who actually
hardly knew what she was doing, hardly gave a name to
what she did. To estrange Laura from the affections of her
master, to excite his jealousy and distrust of Captain Lacy,
were things she would hardly have thought dishonest, had
she stopped to think them over. But she did not stop to
think, she only went on, day by day, led forward by her
strange success, and not reflecting there must some day be
a reckoning and a counter-movement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutherland, worn out by her anxieties, again succumbed 
to her old enemy, and was confined to her room by
a headache that threatened longer battle than it ordinarily
gave. Warren had little encouragement to come to his
cousin's room, being met with nothing better than morose
indifference and dullness; Salome only waddled up there
once or twice a day, to croon over and bemoan him, and in

<!-- page 352 -->

consequence, the care of him devolved, in a very great
degree, on Nattee. A dangerous duty it had grown to be,
and with a peevish fear, she dreaded the time that it should
end. She almost longed to see him once more burning
with fever, raving with frenzy, that she might feel he was
safe from the care and presence of the others&mdash;that he would
need her care and presence for a long while to come.</p>

<p>And, indeed, he seemed in no haste to exchange it for a
wider liberty. The doctor had said he was fit to go downstairs 
whenever he might wish, and Nattee watched
anxiously to see him avail himself of the permission; but
two days had passed, and he was still moodily and sullenly
moping in his room. On the second day, as she set his
dinner down before him, he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"When does Captain Lacy go, Nattee?"</p>

<p>"I haven't heard anything said about his going. Master
Larry," she answered carelessly, "Wasn't it unlucky that
it should ha' been his bridle-arm was lamed?"</p>

<p>Seeing he gave her no answer (though, indeed, he rarely
did give her any to such gratuitous remarks), she went on
after a moment:</p>

<p>"His man says he's had a letter from New York, and
that he won't have to go there now. <i>He</i> don't think he's
in very much of a hurry to go away from here. He says
he's only bent on getting a discharge, and bein' at liberty
to take Miss&mdash;I mean&mdash;to go home to England. <i>I</i> don't
know anything about it&mdash;that's what Richard says."</p>

<p>"You'd do well to have less gossipping with Richard,"
the young master said impatiently. "You may go now.
I'll call you if I want anything."</p>

<!-- page 353 -->

<p>That afternoon, toward twilight, Larry paced his solitary
room, restless and unstrung. He was not quite the master
of himself he had been before this illness; it had told upon
his nerves considerably, though he could not endure to
acknowledge it to himself; it galled him as it always galls a
strong man, to find he had so much in common with the
weak and the irresolute. He had resolved to face the
family to-night, but every time he put his hand upon the
door to open it, he found himself so far beneath the sway of
his sick fancy, as to tremble and turn back, with a longing
to stay still a little longer in his moody solitude. But
at length he murmured, with an impatient vehemence,
"Enough of this. There is no more excuse. I will go
down now, and try to brave it out. The devil himself
shan't see I have a rival."</p>

<p>He gave himself no more time to think, and strode out
of the room. The hall was dark and chilly, for the sun was
down, and it was a dun and gloomy place at noonday, even,
having no windows of its own, and being lighted only per
favor of the rooms that opened into it. His right arm was
in a sling, and with his left he groped slowly down the
stairs, feeling strangely uncertain of his footing, giddy and
uncomfortable. When he reached the lower hall, he took
one or two turns up and down it, before he approached the
sitting-room door.</p>

<p>As, in moments of dire and sudden peril, it is said that
one's whole past life will flash before one, clear and well
defined even in the smallest and longest forgotten detail, so
at that moment, when he least craved the reminiscence,
there rushed across Lawrence's mind all that he now most

<!-- page 354 -->

wished to forget. An hour ago, he had thought himself
the master; now, the traitor, Memory, had slipped the
leash, and had darted, with the speed of lightning, back
over ground he had sworn her dangerous foot should never
touch again. All the humiliation of his defeat, all the
bitterness of his disappointment, all his unconquered love
his unavailing tenderness, rushed back upon him as he stood
with his hand upon the door that bounded him from
criticism and contempt. Could he, with all that dancing
before his eyes, crowding in upon his brain, overflowing
from his heart, meet the woman he had lost, the man who
had supplanted him, as his pride and his manliness alone
dictated he should meet them? No, this was not the hour
to face their curiosity: he would yield this once to a weakness 
he could not conquer; another day should find him
stronger in mind and body; the sanctuary of his solitary
room was open to him still&mdash;he would seek its charity
to-night, and come forth from it refreshed and restored
to-morrow. Coward! The indistinct murmur of voices
within the sitting-room, the gleam of light from the cracks
below the door, unnerved and shook him as no danger,
tangible or imaginary, had ever done before, and he fairly
panted and shivered as he regained the second floor and
crossed the threshold of his own apartment.</p>

<p>"A fool&mdash;a cursed fool!" he muttered, walking impatiently 
up and down a few times; then crossing to the
mantelpiece, he leaned his head on his arm upon it, and
groaned aloud. The fire had blazed up brightly since he
had left it, and made such a light within, that the soft,
new twilight without looked dim and grey in comparison.</p>

<!-- page 355 -->

<p>The room was such a self-willed, incongruous, arbitrary
one, as could have belonged to no man but Larry Sutherland. 
The antique piety of the jambs, and the unnecessary
magnificence of the great brass andirons, were things hereditary, 
things forced on him; the comfortable beauty of the
bed, the good taste and prettiness of the cloth and cushion
under the greenish-looking, queer-shaped glass, were refinements 
he had submitted to rather than accepted from
his mother; but the great uncouth leather-covered chair
drawn up by the window, the rough, irregular shelves,
crammed with books and boxes, ink-horns and chessmen,
the walls, covered with deer's antlers and fishing-rods,
tobacco-pouches and game-bags, charcoal sketches <i>al fresco</i>,
and colored prints, in frames and out of frames, showed the
master's taste and will. Good housewives would have
called it a den, and good fellows would have found it a
paradise. It was a large room, too, with three narrow,
deep windows, and a blundering, aimless recess at the left
side of the fireplace, which served Lawrence as a repository
for his guns and hunting coats and boots, and which was an
enduring grief and trial to his mother, by reason of the
wild confusion and disorder which reigned continually
there. The firelight did not penetrate its depths, but the
panther-skin, which hung above the entrance, vibrated
slightly when Lawrence entered, as if the draught, perhaps,
did. Kelpie sat up on her haunches with an attentive,
inquiring expression of face, as if she were not quite clear
in her mind about what was going on, and seemed to
suppress with effort a short, suspicious bark. She might
have gratified herself, however, without damaging her

<!-- page 356 -->

interests with her master, for it would have been a furious
burst of canine excitement that would have roused his attention 
at that moment. Presently Kelpie appeared to conclude,
at any rate, it was no business of hers, and after nosing
around with diminishing interest, she unjointed her erect
forepaws, and laid herself down upon the scarlet-bound
fawnskin that formed the rug, but cocked up her eye
attentively, as if awaiting further developments.</p>

<p>Lawrence did not move from the attitude he had first
assumed, but another groan and a lower one presently
escaped his lips, and Kelpie was again much excited, raising
her head and putting it a good deal on one side, then suddenly 
flashing it around toward the door, as a soft step
crossed the threshold. She did not salute the new comer
with a bark, however, but half rose, and swept her fringy
tail in welcome back and forth across the rug, and looked
up rather reproachfully in her unmoved master's face. But
the timid footsteps of the visitor failed to arrest his ear, as
did her first no less timid salutation. She had stood beside
him on the rug some seconds, and had faltered more than
one low question, before he raised his head and saw her.</p>

<p>"Laura!" he exclaimed, with an involuntary start.</p>

<p>"You did not hear me knock," she said confusedly. "I
ventured to come in."</p>

<p>A pause; Larry for his life could not have spoken then.
Laura was the first to break it.</p>

<p>"I thought you were coming downstairs to-day. Are
you not as well?"</p>

<p>A quick suspicion darted through his mind: "She was in
the hall, she saw me go down and guessed why I came back

<!-- page 357 -->

so soon. Pity has brought her&mdash;<i>pity!</i>" And in a tone in
which there was much both of coldness and distance, he
answered he was better, and nothing but indolence kept
him a prisoner in his room. Nattee had taken such good
care of him, and it was so much trouble to dress, while he
knew he was restricted to the house.</p>

<p>"I feared you were worse, or I should not have come,"
Laura said, pained at his tone and frightened at what she
had done.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you."</p>

<p>"Is there nothing I can do for you? I should be very
glad to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I don't think of anything. You are very kind."</p>

<p>The words weren't anything&mdash;but the tone! Every
inflection was a wound, none the less cruel that it was
intangible and vague, like the pain and discomfort of a
delirium. What made it hurt her so? Why did she feel
so miserably pained and chilled? On the whole, there was
no reason for it, but she wished herself away most unreservedly. 
She took a step toward the door, then turned
back again irresolutely; she had not made him understand
at all.</p>

<p>"I have been so un&mdash;uncomfortable about you," she said,
with the most enticing timidity of voice and manner. "I
am sure you must be lonely here. <i>Won't</i> you come
down?"</p>

<p>"I'll come down to-morrow," he said quickly. "I am
more comfortable here for this evening. Nattee will bring
my supper up."</p>

<p>All this while Lawrence was remembering, "My unpardonable 

<!-- page 358 -->

carelessness nearly killed her, and she is trying to
show me she forgives it." And Laura was thinking, "Here
is the man who saved my life, and he is trying to show me
my gratitude is not acceptable."</p>

<p>Which cross-purposing did not tend at all to simplify and
pacificate the relations between them. As Laura turned her
head away, something in her face or expression seemed to
strike Larry, for he added hastily:</p>

<p>"And you? I haven't asked you whether you are over
the effects of this miserable adventure. Are you quite
recovered?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am better to-day," she said, catching at the
softening in his manner, and hesitatingly attempting to
continue with something that did not come, and then
breaking down and blushing.</p>

<p>Lawrence gave her a hasty, searching look, and called
himself a brute for not seeing before how pale and changed
she was. Indeed, it was but too apparent that that most
miserable adventure, as he rightly termed it, had been no
trifling accident to her. She looked slighter and more
fragile far than formerly, her eyes were heavy, and an ill-concealed 
languor marked her voice and manner. "This is
the work of my besotted temper and mad jealousy," he
thought, remorsefully; but he said aloud, in a voice more
stern than sorrowful:</p>

<p>"You are looking worse than I expected to see you. I
imagined you were quite recovered."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am vastly better," she persisted ("to spare me,"
he thought bitterly). "I came down to my dinner to-day."</p>

<!-- page 359 -->

<p>"Not for the first time?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"No, I attempted it a week ago, but did not feel quite
so well for it."</p>

<p>"And you have been in your room ever since?"</p>

<p>"Till to-day at noon."</p>

<p>"I understood&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;I imagined you were thoroughly 
yourself again. I don't know, Laura, how I am to
make amends to you for what I've done. I believe you will
have to be satisfied with my regrets; they are very sincere,
though they won't do you much good."</p>

<p>"Regrets! That I am better? That's ungracious,"
Laura said, not exactly knowing what else to say, but
knowing that what she did say was not quite wise nor
strictly true. But Lawrence was so strange and stern, she
did not know what to make of him; she longed to tell him
all the gratitude she felt for that night's services; but he
looked so dark and moody, and spoke so distantly, the
words died on her lips. She would go, she would not
thrust herself upon him; he did not like her thanks, and it
was not her fault.</p>

<p>She turned to leave him, murmuring something about
good night, and her hopes that he'd be better in the morning, 
when he exclaimed suddenly, "Don't go, Laura; I am
sure you might see I'm very lonely here."</p>

<p>"Is it my fault?" she said, in a changed manner, not
offering to come back, though not going further toward the
door.</p>

<p>"I did not accuse you of it," he said, with a sigh, turning 
away, and leaning his forehead down upon the mantelpiece 
again.</p>

<!-- page 360 -->

<p>"No, you did not say it was my fault," she returned,
after a moment; "but you implied"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did I imply?" he asked; and Laura's woman's
wit deserted her upon that one occasion; she could not tell
exactly what he did imply.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you thought, Laura," he said, raising
his head. "You thought I implied it was a penance to you
to stay here and help my solitude&mdash;that it would be only
from duty you would stay if you did stay; that you would
long to be downstairs among the rest. Isn't it so? Didn't
you think I meant that? And didn't I mean right?"</p>

<p>"No," said Laura steadily, "for no one wants me downstairs. 
Warren is not come home yet, and my uncle never
notices whether I am in the room or not."</p>

<p>"And Captain Lacy?" Lawrence said.</p>

<p>"Captain Lacy is not here."</p>

<p>"Not here! when did he go?"</p>

<p>"An hour ago."</p>

<p>"And when does he come back?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and looked at him steadily for a
moment. "Never, Lawrence, I believe."</p>

<p>"Never!" he echoed, in a strange, satirical tone. "It
costs you dreadfully to say that, I can see."</p>

<p>"Yes, it <i>does</i> cost me dreadfully," she said, with sudden
feeling. And with inexplicable passion she buried her face
in her hands and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Laura!" exclaimed Lawrence, catching her hands and
drawing them from her face as he bent his own down to
her, "you are not crying because he has gone away. I
know you are not."</p>

<!-- page 361 -->

<p>"Let me go! let me go!" she murmured, with a wild
struggle.</p>

<p>"No, Laura," he whispered, as he held her fast and
looked into her eyes; "never, never again."</p>

<p>Never, never again. Captive to the sweetest, fondest
rule, slave to the bondage from which no woman's heart
rebels, bent under the tyranny that blesses beyond liberty;
the long struggle conquered, the long doubt ended, the
new, sweet, full life begun.</p>

<p>And while the lovers stood, intoxicated with the strange
new happiness that they found on each other's lips, in each
other's arms, the fitfully shining firelight glinted for a
minute on a stealthy figure with lurid eyes and tight-clenched 
fingers, stealing cat-like to the door; and then the
blaze fell and when it started up again, only the panther
skin, swinging faintly back over the untenanted recess, and
the erected ears and attentive eyes of the dog upon the
rug, showed there had been any added to or detracted
from the inmates of the room.</p>

<p>But the young lovers took no heed; their ears were open
to nothing but their own low whispers, the firelight only
showed them the new light in each other's eyes, the new
beauty on each other's face. All was night outside the
halo of their love; shadows might thicken, misery might
weep, despair might dash itself to earth, they saw, heard,
felt it not; blinded by their own great happiness, dazzled
by the nearness of their own delight.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dark house was hushed in its first sleep; only one
light waked in all its many chambers, and that one was
shaded and hidden in a corner of Nattee's little room.
Nattee herself crouched in another, as if afraid of it herself,
and listened, breathless, to every sound that came through
the partly open door. Many sounds will always come to
any listening ears, in an old country house, in the stillest
and most breathless night; rats will revel in the wainscot,
crickets will chirrup on the hearth, snappings of the half-smothered 
fires, creakings of uneasy hinges will occur; and
at each and all of these had Nattee started and trembled
since she commenced her vigil. She had heard Salome's
deafening snore begin, and had seen, through the crack in
Steady's door, the little girl's hands crossed upon her
bosom in childish, quiet slumber, and yet she feared to stir.
What if they did not sleep below; what if those low, uncertain 
sounds were the restless steps of some wakeful member
of the household? But she must take her chance; there was

<!-- page 363 -->

no safety or hope in waiting longer; the old clock in the
sitting-room had long ago struck one&mdash;it was three hours
since the last door had shut&mdash;she would wait no further,
there never would be a safer time. With cautious, hesitating 
step, she crossed to where the shaded candle flickered, 
and stooping down, after a moment of irresolution,
blew it out; then, as if that had been the decisive point, she
started up with new resolution, and catching up the little
bundle that lay upon the bed, she stole through the door
and toward the stairs without a glance behind.</p>

<p>She had gained the second story hall before she stopped
to reconnoitre. The attic door fell to noiselessly; she held
her breath to listen, but all was still here as it was above.
The way lay clear for her; another minute, and she might
be beyond the house, but an impulse stronger even than
her wild desire of flight drew her toward Larry's door.
Ah! the dangers that she ran! He might be waking;
lovers do not find wakefulness a penance, or her step might
rouse him from his light and dreamy slumber, and then she
was undone. But had the dangers been a thousand fold
more imminent she would have braved them all. She
pushed the door open slowly and softly and crept within
the room. It was flooded with moonlight; from the narrow
window opposite the bed a broad stripe of silvery white
light streamed, and lay across the stone window-seat, the
rough matted floor, and the low, white bed itself; noonday
could hardly have shown Nattee the face and form she had
come to look her last upon, more clearly than this soft
moonlight did.</p>

<p>Careless and brave and bonny, even in his sleep, a dreaming 

<!-- page 364 -->

smile playing about his handsome mouth, and a manly
grace making good any attitude into which he chanced, to
throw himself. No wonder poor Nattee's heart died in her
as she thought it was the last time she should ever again
look upon him, sleeping or waking, while she lived; the
last time that she could feel that nothing but a quickly-broken 
sleep debarred her from the sound of his brave
voice, the glance of his kind eye; he was the master she
had been taught to love, to look upon with pride; she had
learned her lesson but too well, and here was the cruel end.
The kindness and manliness and generosity of his boyhood
all came back to her; oh, that she could have died to serve
him, that she could have shown him a better return for
all his long forbearance than she should show him by her
flight.</p>

<p>"Oh, Master Larry, if you only, only knew!" she murmured, 
sinking on her knees beside the bed; "if you only
knew what made me go, you wouldn't be hard on me for
going! Oh, it kills me to think he'll be angry with me
when he comes to know I'm gone&mdash;it kills me to think he'll
never gi' me a kind thought again, for all I've never done
him ill, and would die, die, die to do him any good!"</p>

<p>It was so cruel, so impossible to tear herself away from
the sight of what had always been best and dearest to her
since she could remember, that more than once her resolve
gave way, and she abandoned the purpose she was pledged
to. To serve him, to live always in his sight, would be
better than a life of ease away from him. No one should
coax her from him, no one should make her go. But then
came the thought of those two lovers by the fireside, of

<!-- page 365 -->

their low whispers, their fond looks, and she started up,
lest the terrible, blood-thirsty, jealous pang of that first
sight should seize again upon her. She dared not stay;
she fled, poor wretch, as much from herself as from her
bondage; she was so pursued and tortured and beset with
misery, she knew not what way to look, she cared not what
fate overtook her, so that it freed her from this abiding
pain and fear. Another moment of passionate weeping,
with her face pressed against the floor&mdash;another glance that
spoke the bitterness of death&mdash;and she was gone. Her
light foot woke no echoes as she stole past her mistress'
room, the hall-door closed behind her without a sound, and
she was standing, before she paused to think, in the clear
moonlight and the fresh, cold air.</p>

<p>She did not feel, till that chill struck her, that she was
actually a fugitive, that she had voluntarily abandoned
home and protection, and was roofless and solitary under
the open sky. But there was too much danger in the
present to leave time for anticipation or reflection; how to
get outside the precincts of the farmhouse and beyond the
outbuildings and inclosures without rousing either of the
dogs who watched around them nightly, or any of the men
who slept in the barn or workshop, was the present vital
question. That their slumbers were unusually light about
this period, and their vigilance extreme, she had remembered 
with apprehension from the first. A stealthy band
of Indians had for a fortnight past infested the neighboring
farmyards by night, and the adjacent woods by day, and
only three nights before had driven off in triumph one of
Ralph Sutherland's finest heifers and several of his most

<!-- page 366 -->

cherished sheep, which loss had so enraged the old man,
that he had deeply sworn the villains should be tracked and
caught if there was any justice left in Ulster. And much
to the surprise of all the men, he had backed his threatened 
vengeance with the liberal offer of a sovereign to the
first one who should discover the retreat of the marauders,
or lead to their arrest. The men were greatly excited by
the unusual munificence of their master, and were stimulated 
to most painful vigils. Nattee's only hope was that
three nights' watching would have worn their enthusiasm
out a little, and that their natural and inborn sleepiness
would by this time have begun to prevail over their newly
aroused cupidity.</p>

<p>She stole around the corner of the house, trembling at
her own shadow in the moonlight, and at the light sound
of her footsteps on the frozen ground. Creeping along
below the shrubbery, she gained the wall beyond the grape-arbor, 
and, raising herself, cast an eager glance around.
There might be eyes in every window, lurking spies in
every bush! Her blood curdled at the thought of what
miscarriage would cost her; if she were but safely out into
the lane!</p>

<p>She threw her bundle over the wall, and climbed up
cautiously herself, then slid down as quick as thought upon
the other side; but below the wall was an irregular growth
of bushes and tall weeds, now crisp, and dry, and brittle,
and, light and cautious as it was, her descent among them
caused a crackling and rustling so unexpected that she
uttered a low cry of consternation, as she caught up her
bundle and sprang clear of them out into the orchard.

<!-- page 367 -->

No time now to listen whether any one else had heard
what had so startled her, but, run as swiftly as she might,
she could not help catching the sound she so dreaded in
the distance&mdash;the low growl, and then the sharp bark, of
the watch-dog by the barn. Heaven have mercy now!
A hundred yards lay between her and the stone wall that
separated the orchard and the lane. Once clear of that
she could defy them all, for there was neither man, nor
boy, nor dog upon the place could match with her in speed.
Her wild Indian blood was up; she would fight like a tiger,
whatever crossed her path.</p>

<p>She had reached the wall, and had just put out her hand
toward it, when the fleet, light-running of the wakeful
dog coming down the lane made her spring back and
stoop down. The mastiff had not yet bellowed out his
alarum; he was only reconnoitering the ground and muttering 
out his dark suspicions in a low, uncertain growl.
He had dashed out from the barn, and reached the lane by
a short cut, and now would just effectually head her off.
Ah! His quick ear had not played him false, the growl
was deepening into a bark as he approached&mdash;his unerring
instinct had brought him to the actual stone, where, half a
minute before, Nattee had laid her eager hand; but as
his paws touched the wall, and his quick head appeared
above it, a large stone met it, from the waiting hand of
Nattee, whose hand and eye had never missed their aim, and
with a deep howl the dog fell back in his death-agony.</p>

<p>She crouched down a moment more, and listened for
some sound that would indicate pursuit; but no, evidently
the sleepy negroes had lost in dreams all memory of the

<!-- page 368 -->

reward, and Nattee recollected now that the other dog
had been taken away with Dave, on a journey of a couple
of days into the mountains. Dead dogs tell no immediate
tales, and Nattee cleared the fence with an easy bound,
and shot across into the shadow of the hedge-row of lilacs
on the other side. She then abandoned the mad pace at
which she had traversed the orchard, and fell into a rapid,
cautious run, pausing every half dozen yards to ascertain
if she had roused pursuit, and then speeding ahead, neither
fast enough to exhaust herself, nor slow enough to put herself 
in danger.</p>

<p>At the end of the lane she made a longer pause, looking
up and down the highway, into which it led, before she
dared to cross it. What did she expect to see abroad at
that deep hour of night? It seemed a needless caution,
night and silence reigned so absolute.</p>

<p>Silent and safe as it all looked, however, the girl shivered 
as she cowered in the shadow of the hedge, and
glanced ahead at the broad patch of moonlight she had to
cross before she reached the friendly darkness of the
woods. Delay, however, could not make the danger less,
so catching up the bundle that had fallen at her feet, she
sprang boldly across the highway, and struck into the
unsheltered cross road that led into the Five Mile Woods,
instinctively bending low, however, and skimming along
the ground as near the fence as possible. A natural, but
an unavailing caution, for her lengthened shadow stretched
far across the bare, unshaded road, too conspicuous an
object to be missed by any eyes, even the most inattentive,
and none but the most watchful were likely to be open at

<!-- page 369 -->

such an hour as that. When she reached the woods, she
made eagerly for the dark path that led into them, forgetting, 
till she was deep in the forest, all that train of
fearful fancies with which her superstitious mind was filled.
The alternate gloom and ghastliness of the way, now
leading through dense evergreens, meeting, black and impenetrable, 
above her head, now passing under leafless and
lofty trees, shedding strange and wavering shadows at her
feet, would have chilled her with terror, if her errand had
had no other terrors. There was a fearful stillness when
she paused, there were more fearful noises when she
moved; the dead leaves rustled audibly, the icicles and
fallen branches broke and crackled startlingly beneath her
tread, and presently, far beyond her, deep in the woods, a
hoarse owl began his hideous screech.</p>

<p>This was no time for repentance; it was unavailing to
look back&mdash;she must pursue unflinchingly this dangerous
experiment of liberty that had looked so tempting in the
promise, that stood so thick with perils even at the outset.
She carried in her bosom the letter Pertinax had given
her that evening, which, he had told her, once safe in
the hands of his charitable brother, the minister, at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
would insure her protection and safe conduct to whatever
asylum she might choose&mdash;either refuge with a powerful
tribe of Indians in the Northwest, of whom her father
came, and who would willingly receive her, or safety
among the sympathizers and well-wishers of the old
dissenter, to whom she should be forwarded, in that most
Christian and most Quaker province, named for him of
landed charity and well-heralded good deeds.</p>

<!-- page 370 -->

<p>"Courage, courage, girl! There isn't a Christian in the
land, but holds thee wrongly bound, there's hundreds o'
kind hands will help thee on; there's hundreds o' true
hearts that ache for such as thee. Be quick, be brave, be
cautious, thou'll have naught to fear."</p>

<p>Nattee murmured the words over to herself and tried to
think that she believed them. Indeed, she did well to
remind herself of all that was comfortable in her future,
her present was unpromising enough. She had not estimated 
the dangers she would run, when, in her moment
of mad despair, she had besought the restless preacher
to help her to escape. Encouraged, and kept up to her
desperate resolve by his sympathy and eloquence, she had
not flagged till the moment of her parting with her
master: from that point to the present, necessity of quick
action had goaded her forward; but now, in this ghastly
wilderness, with her journey just begun, with all her plans
to form, there was a moment for reflection.</p>

<p>And instead of spending it in prudent and intelligent
deliberations on the measures she should adopt, and the
route she should pursue, this most unwise and most unreasonable 
fugitive sank down, overcome with terror and
regret, and hiding her eyes from the dancing shadows that
the moonlight shed, wept bitter and unavailing tears over her
new liberty, and its unlooked-for charms. Most irrational
and illogical, but most characteristic, the undisciplined,
impulsive mind of the poor slave reverted at that moment
of supernatural terrors and bodily fears to the safety and
comfort of the home she had abandoned; the present
discouragement overbore all the promised advantages, the

<!-- page 371 -->

little spite and venom that her otherwise affectionate heart
had lately harbored, had exhausted itself in this short
effort&mdash;she was humbled, repentant, abject&mdash;she had done
enough to satisfy herself. The recollection of her young
master's kindness her indignation had never clouded, but
now returned with it the memory of her mistress' thousand
gentle favors and continual forbearance, the easy, pleasant
life she had led, the good nature and merriment of the
kitchen, the gaiety and interest of the sitting-room. She
forgot the brutal ugliness of the tyrant, from whose unkindness, 
though, to do him justice, she suffered no more
than his whole household did; she forgot Salome's taunts
and persecutions; she forgot, or overcame, her jealous bitterness 
against Laura&mdash;she was willing to go back in
humbleness, and see her happiness and her lover's tenderness, 
anything&mdash;anything&mdash;to be out of all this horror,
and to be home again, and to be within sight of the faces
to which she was accustomed, and from which she was
forever separating herself. And the young clergyman&mdash;how 
her faith died in her last instructor when she thought
of <i>him</i>. He was a Christian, she was very sure, and yet
she knew <i>he</i> would not have given her a helping hand
in this ungrateful flight, which the Methodist had said all
Christians would encourage. She had no idea what was
the ground of her belief but her quick instinct told her,
Warren's Christianity would have shown itself in a very
different way. What if he were right after all, and her
leader wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;and had led her wrong! Her
entire incapacity for dealing with the question in any
other way than as it touched her passions; her bewilderment 

<!-- page 372 -->

and weakness when it came to deciding it by reason,
threw her into wild distress; she had no stay at all. Like
all persons of uneducated mind and conscience, she was
subject to the most harassing changes of feeling, and the
most unmanageable doubts. Rudderless and unready, her
bark seemed at the mercy of a black and engulphing sea;
the shore was already but a dim and distant line.</p>

<p>And mixed up with these bitter thoughts, entangled, knit
in with their bewilderment and consternation, came the
recollection of the frightful stories that were told about
these very woods. Her blood had curdled many a time by
the warm chimney-corner, only to listen to the recital of
them, and now she was braving all the terrors of the place,
alone at midnight, and on a questionable errand, too. Low
moanings, faint whisperings, distant sighings, were all that
seemed to justify her fears, till&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Nattee raised her head with a wild throb of terror, and
started to her feet; superstitious alarm died away in the
dim distance at the approach of such substantial danger as
that sound implied. A smothered, wary step, often pausing,
reconnoitering stealthily, but approaching swiftly, following
closely on her very track. Blind, deaf, giddy with fear, for
a moment she staggered back; then the strong, sharp reaction 
of a clearer terror shot through her, and she bounded
forward with a fleetness almost fabulous. She darted out
of the path she had been following, and made directly for
the bed of a stream, about half a mile deeper in the woods
upon her right. The recent rain and melting of the snow
had filled it pretty full, and in following it the sound of her
footsteps would be drowned by the rushing of its waters.

<!-- page 373 -->

She knew it pretty well, too, and could safely follow it for
miles, for it led up the mountain that lay partly in her
route. At any rate, it was better than the beaten path that
her pursuer now was in, where every step was audible, and
it was better than the thick, tangled brushwood through
which she made such tantalizingly slow progress. At last
she reached the stream, and only pausing for an instant to
know if she were followed, she sprang lightly along from
rock to rock, sometimes plashing through the water, sometimes 
clambering along the bank. She did not make the
headway she would have made in the clear path, however.
Her mind began to misgive her&mdash;this was a perilous experiment; 
the stones were so coated with ice, it was an effort
constantly to keep her feet. She was so exhausted with
her exertions to keep herself from falling, that, panting and
trembling, she at length sank down to recover breath and
look around her. The stone on which she sat was lying at
the foot of a little waterfall, which, tumbling over a ledge
of rock far above her head, fell noisily down into the
stream beside her. Indeed it was only from this point the
brooklet began its even, peaceable course; above, it tumbled
down the steep side of the mountain, of which this was
the legitimate base.</p>

<p>Nattee cast a fearful look up the rocky and precipitous
path that lay before her, and then bent eagerly forward in
a listening attitude. Ah, the treacherous brook! While
its roar had drowned her steps, it had hidden her pursuer's
as well; for a stealthy shadow, creeping through the
thicket, not a hundred yards from where she sat, caught
her eye. Could she hope to win at this close game? Mortal 

<!-- page 374 -->

terror has no hopes, no expectations, no calculations; it
<i>saves itself</i> till Death has it by the throat. A steep and
perilous ascent, indeed, it was that wound upward from
where poor Nattee had taken her momentary rest, and in
daylight she would have thought twice before she risked it;
sharp sudden rocks, glazed treacherously with ice&mdash;huge
fallen trees, with their rough and scraggy branches still
upon them, lay across and beside the stream; the sides
of the gully which it had worn were even steeper and
rougher than the bed of the stream itself. For a few
moments it seemed as if the courage and fleetness of the
Indian girl were more than equal to the dangers of the
way; by marvellous strength and stratagem, she distanced
her foe at every step&mdash;owing to this, perhaps, that she took
no care to avoid the cuts and bruises and blows the dangerous 
way presented, while her adversary, if one of flesh and
blood, must have lost much time in saving himself from
them. But at last, even the desperation and cunning of the
fugitive stood baffled&mdash;a more complete trap than the one
into which she had fallen could hardly have been devised
by the most malignant ingenuity. Above her, the rocks
rose to the height of twenty feet&mdash;a perpendicular wall
across the little gully, over which the water was rushing
noisily, scattering spray upon the rocks that turned fast
into ice as it fell. The sides of the ravine were absolutely
impassable for thirty feet on both hands, and it was madness 
to think she could run back a distance of thirty feet,
and struggle up the first accessible rock, before her pursuer
met her. Must she fall into his hands&mdash;was she, indeed,
brought to bay?</p>

<!-- page 375 -->

<p>She cast a frenzied look around the glittering walls of her
prison; oh, her cursed folly and forgetfulness! Why had
she not remembered the waterfall! If she had but scaled
the bank a few rods below it! There was not a crevice,
not a ledge behind which she could hide, nothing to shelter
her from her foe, from the instant he gained the turn that
led into the fatal den. She caught one wild hope, as she
glanced up: a great tree, fallen across the gully, rested on
the opposite rocks, and made a bridge twenty feet above
her head. One branch hung from it, almost within her
reach; she might gain it by a spring&mdash;there was a chance it
was decayed and weak, and indeed it looked too slight at
best to hold her; but it was the only hope. She flung her
bundle into the stream, in which she was standing ankle-deep, 
and giving a spring like a wildcat, grasped the bough
with both hands and struggled up it. It swayed and
creaked&mdash;in another instant it would have given way; but
Nattee's bruised and bleeding arms were clinging to the
rough trunk of the tree before it parted; and swinging herself 
up, she crept along on hands and knees upon it, and
gained the bank just in time to look down and see through
the rocks a black shadow in the moonlight standing underneath 
the waterfall. No time for exultation&mdash;where should
she turn next? If she left the stream, she left the only
guide through the wild forest, and yet it would be a guide as
well to her pursuer; and how long could such a flight be
kept up? But, clearing the bank of the stream about a
dozen yards, she resumed the ascent of the mountain, keeping 
within sound of the brook, however, and within sight
of the rocks that lined its course. Farther up, she hoped

<!-- page 376 -->

there might be some asylum, where she could obtain a short
respite, and indeed she sorely needed it, for her strength
was almost spent. She lagged painfully, as she toiled on,
glancing constantly behind, and half-expecting every moment 
to see her swift adversary at her heels. Now she
began to feel the misfortune of her tender rearing; for,
strong and supple by nature, she had never learned the
endurance and hardness that field-labor would have insured
to her; out-door and really hard work had never been imposed 
on her; and so, though she had begun her flight so
bravely, it seemed to threaten she would not keep it up as
well as she had begun it.</p>

<p>A ledge of rock just ahead of her seemed to promise
difficulty of attainment, but security of retreat, if once
attained. Wet, and bruised, and panting, she reached the
foot of it, and essayed to climb it; but the excitement
that had attended her escape from the peril of the
waterfall below was paying for itself upon her nerves just
now. She lost her usual steadiness of hand and eye, and the
climbing became a difficult and a dangerous experiment.
Half way up, she lost her balance; grasping a projecting
stone for support, it gave way at her touch, and she fell
backward to the ground, the loosened stone striking heavily
upon her foot, then rolling slowly down the descent. For
a few minutes, the agony she endured from the wound it
had inflicted made her lose the sense of danger; she
writhed upon the ground, and pressed her hand upon her
mouth to suppress her scream of pain. But as the first
sharpness of the suffering passed over, the real peril began
to assert its nearness: she raised her head and listened.</p>

<!-- page 377 -->

<p>Coming from the direction of the brook she heard steps;
there were too many trees and too much underbrush between 
to allow her to see any one, but she felt the cat-like
tread within a stone's throw of her, and turned sick with
fear when she tried to rise and found that she was worse
than helpless. The steps came on, cautiously and swiftly&mdash;they 
were within a rod of her retreat, when suddenly they
halted. The stone that was rolling down the mountain
caught, for the first time, the intruder's ear; and well he
might be startled at the sound. It had increased in velocity
as it went on, and now, at this distance, seemed like
nothing so much as a person running heedlessly and swiftly
down the hill, springing over obstacles, crashing through
underbrush, falling against trees, pausing, then dashing on.
For one moment there was a pause that seemed to Nattee
ages of suspense and terror, and her heart gave one bound,
and then almost stopped its beating, when she heard the
quick steps of her pursuer hurrying down the hill in the
direction of the distant sound that had deceived him.</p>

<p>Yes, thank Heaven, she was safe! Safe&mdash;but for how
long?&mdash;how many hours could she hope to remain undiscovered, 
within two miles of her master's house, in a tract
of woodland well known to every man upon the place?
Once in the mountains, she could at least have had an equal
chance with them; or once well on the road to Kiskatom&mdash;but 
now! Every movement cost her unbearable agony;
she might as well have been manacled and fettered as to
lay there, crippled and helpless, two miles at least from
safety, within hearing of the treacherous landmark that
had so nearly worked her ruin, and almost within sight of

<!-- page 378 -->

the spot where she had thrown away her bundle. By day
light, her absence would be known to all the house; and
she shuddered and hid her face, as she remembered whose
unchristian ears the news would first meet, and what
wrathful vengeance was brewing for her even then. Poor
Nattee!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Steady</span>!" cried Salome in a voice which caused some
agitation in that little girl's mind, "Steady, you run right
upstairs and tell that lazy piece she'll hear of it ef I hev to
send for her agin."</p>

<p>Steady dropped her knives, cast a frightened look at the
unready breakfast-table, and hurried up, knocked faintly
against Nattee's door, and waited for an answer. Now
Steady was snubbed by everybody in the kitchen, and had
grown very shy of conveying messages between the
unfriendly parties in it, having found she was quite sure to
do wrong whatever she did, and that the blows were more
apt to fall on her than on anybody else. So after thumping
some time on the door and getting no answer, she contented
herself with delivering Salome's message at the keyhole,
and going downstairs again.</p>

<!-- page 380 -->

<p>"Did you tell her, you snail?" cried Salome, as she
entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I told her," said little Steadfast, not doubting but
she spoke the truth. She did not like to say Nattee was
ugly and wouldn't answer her, for fear of getting both
Nattee and herself into trouble.</p>

<p>After she had cleaned the knives to the last degree of
cleanness, she bethought herself, "Can't I be getting the
table ready for breakfast till she comes down?" It was
quite as much for the pleasure of doing something that she
had never done before, as to help Nattee, that she set about
it, but either motive would have been sufficient to give a
zest to the employment. She succeeded in it beyond her
hopes, however, and when Salome, still storming at Nattee's
lazy ways, and threatening vengeance in the intervals of
her work, dished the breakfast and actually allowed Steady
to carry it in and put it on the table, it was the proudest
moment of the little girl's life, and she forgot to be sorry
for the rod that was pickling for Nattee.</p>

<p>She was allowed to wait upon the breakfast-table, and
acquitted herself so unobtrusively that no one (Mrs.
Sutherland not being present), noticed the change from the
ordinary attendant. Laura indeed said, "Why, Steady,
are you here?" But, besides an inquiring smile, she did
not embarrass her with questions upon the reasons of her
presence.</p>

<p>It so happened that the family were late in getting
<i>en route</i> in the day's duties; the old man had overslept
himself, and was as cross as possible in consequence, and
the slaves seemed to have had a premonition of his tardiness,

<!-- page 381 -->

and came lagging into the kitchen for their morning meal a
full half hour later than usual. Consequently, they were
still lingering over it, when the family on the other side of
the dividing partition sat down to theirs, and Salome,
taking breath between their last griddleful of buckwheat-cakes 
and their betters' first installment of muffins, growled
out some pretty hard things of Nattee, and vowed massa
should hear about her the very minute he got through his
breakfast. Reasons of state prevented her going in person
and hauling her down to judgment; the attic stairs were
steep and narrow, and one journey a-day was all she ever
attempted; besides, she always preferred avoiding a personal
encounter with Nattee, and handing her over to the secular
arm when it could conveniently be done. Nattee's eyes had
a flash in them occasionally that made the old hypocrite
uncomfortable, for like all blusterers, she was a profound
coward, and she never railed on her enemy so unreservedly
as when she was out of hearing.</p>

<p>"The lazy, spiled, shiffless thing!" she vented her vexation 
that morning by muttering. "Ye're all a wuthless set,
if massa only knowed it, every one o' ye; but she heads ye
all. She ain't wuth her salt&mdash;she's a nuisance to the house.
And there's another," she went on venomously as Amen,
with a hang-dog look, crept in at the kitchen door. "Where
you been all this time, you little sarpint? Comin' snoopin'
in to breakfast this time o' day! D'ye think ye're goin' te
git it, say? D'ye think so, now?"</p>

<p>"Who wants yer breakfast?" muttered Amen, crawling
toward the fire; and indeed he looked as if he wanted heat
much more than anything just then, for his clothes were

<!-- page 382 -->

wet and muddy, and the skin of which he was guilty had
that peculiar hard, dry look that is consequent upon exposure 
to the cold in them of Africa.</p>

<p>"Missable little cuss!" cried Salome, looking at him
disdainfully. "Jess you wait till Nattee comes down, and
I'll have ye in, both on ye, before the massa. I'll see ef ye
can't come to yer breakfast when I call ye."</p>

<p>"Who wants yer breakfast?" growled the limb again.</p>

<p>This was unusual; for however audacious at other times,
Amen was ordinarily very suave at meal-times, being fond
of his stomach, and knowing that its interests would suffer
materially from Salome's disaffection. "Who wants yer
breakfast?" therefore sounded as if he were either too
much preoccupied to want it, or as if he felt himself, for
some cause, temporarily invested with an importance that
rendered him independent of her favor. Salome could
hardly keep her hands off him at this, she was so bitterly
enraged; but she contented herself with hurling a few
reproaches at him, which broke no bones and seemed to
occasion him no disquiet.</p>

<p>"Jess you wait," she reiterated, "jess you wait till that
there Nattee comes down, and ef you two don't feel the
heft o' massa's lash, my name's not Salome."</p>

<p>"I'll hev to wait a while, then, ef I wait till she comes
down," Amen mumbled, poking his toes into the ashes.</p>

"No ye won't, neither," cried Salome, "fur ef she ain't
here in a couple o' minutes, I'll go up fur her myself."</p>

<p>"Ye can save yerself the trouble," responded Amen,
with great <i>sang froid</i>, "fur ye wouldn't find her."</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?" snapped Salome, looking at him

<!-- page 383 -->

sharply. "Speak up this minute&mdash;what d'ye mean by
sayin' that?"</p>

<p>But Amen, being sure that now he had the ear of the
kitchen, was in no hurry to speak up; he thrust his feet
further into the ashes, and spread his hands before the
blaze, and muttered impudently that he meant "jess" what
he said, and beyond that no satisfaction could be got out
of him till Rube, of whom he stood in some little awe, rose
slowly from the table, and walked over to where he stood,
and collared him firmly.</p>

<p>"What's that ye said 'bout Nattee, hey?"</p>

<p>"Lemme 'lone," muttered Amen, struggling in his grasp.
"Lemme 'lone, or I'll never tell ye nothin'."</p>

<p>The old negro took his hand off him, but kept his eye on
him, and bade him gruffly to proceed. Amen shook himself 
and cast a furtive glance around to ascertain the chance
open to him of securing better terms and a more dignified
position in which to deliver his intelligence; but Rube
"had him on the hip;" he might as well surrender his news
without any further ado, the powerful old negro would
shake it out of him if he did not. He growled something
about Rube's half choking him, rubbed the back of his
neck, looked much injured, and then informed his audience
they might look upstairs and downstairs for Nattee, but
they wouldn't find her, and that it 'ud be one while, he
reckoned, 'fore massa had the pleasure o' layin' the lash
again on her.</p>

<p>"Ye lie, ye whelp, I know ye lie," Salome said, hoarsely
"She daren't run off to save her"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He'd better try lyin' to me," Rube ejaculated, approaching 
his right hand to the youth's throat again.</p>

<!-- page 384 -->

<p>Amen dodged him, and cried, "Well, if ye think I'm
lyin', whar's the use o' talking te me?"</p>

<p>"I'll show ye whar's the use," muttered Rube, bringing
his hand down upon his neck.</p>

"Le' go, le' go," cried Amen, squirming away from
him. "Ye know I ain't a lyin'. Look here; ef I'm a
lyin', what d'ye make o' that?" And he flung down before
them a wet and muddied bundle, tied up in one of Nattee's
familiar bright plaid aprons. There was a dead silence as
Salome snatched it up and eagerly tore it open.</p>

<p>"Where'd ye fine it?" she said at last, in a hoarse, low
voice.</p>

<p>"Ye'll likely know when I tell ye, ole woman," the imp
answered, with an elfish look. The men glanced from one
to another with slow wonder and alarm; the possibility of
such a thing as this had never crossed their minds before.
Rube broke the silence, by starting toward the attic door,
and the whole group waited breathlessly till his step was
heard stumbling down the stairs again.</p>

<p>The old man sat down on a chair beside the door, and
shook his head mournfully. "Well?" cried Salome, impatiently.</p>

<p>"He's spoke true," he said at last. "He's spoke true.
Her bed ain't been slep' in. The poor girl's gone; she's
listened to evil counsels; I might ha' knowed it. She's
been too much over at the Methody's. Where's it all goin'
to end! Poor girl, poor girl!"</p>

<p>"And who's to tell massa?" Salome asked, in a subdued
voice.</p>

<p>"Aye, who?" whispered the others, with a shiver.
"Not I, for one,"&mdash;"Nor I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 385 -->

<p>"Amen, you come along with me," said Rube, after a
pause, getting up and going slowly toward the door.
"And mine you tell the truth to massa, or it'll be the wus
for you."</p>

<p>"I'll mine," muttered the imp, and slunk along after his
mentor. The rest of the group pressed on after them, and
stood around the door, gazing with mingled wonder and
alarm upon the scene. Laura, Warren and Larry were still
at the table; Ralph had moved over to the fire, and was
smoking his pipe in his accustomed corner. It was a part
of his creed never to look up when a door opened or any
noise occurred, but to swear at it "on suspicion," without
raising his eyes. So the slight disturbance caused by the
entrance of Rube and Amen, he greeted with his ordinary
growl, and smoked on without turning his head.</p>

<p>The hope of the holding out of the golden sceptre was
evidently dimming in poor Rube's mind; he looked
anxiously at his master, and twice essayed to speak; there
certainly was nothing encouraging in his face.</p>

<p>"Well, Rube, what is it?" said Larry, after a pause.
"You seem to have something to say to my father."</p>

<p>"I've got bad news to tell him, Massa Larry," Rube
began, and then stopped. Larry had suspected as much
from the portentous faces around the kitchen door, but his
apprehensions had not travelled beyond the rifling of the
hen-roost, or the loss of a dozen more of sheep.</p>

<p>"That's a pity. Rube, but bad news don't improve by
keeping, so you'd better let us hear it."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness I didn't hev to tell ye, Massa Larry,
but&mdash;but&mdash;Nattee's run away"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 386 -->

<p>Old Ralph raised his head with a horrid oath, and told
him that he lied.</p>

<p>"I wish I did, massa," said the old man. "I wish you
may fine out it ain't true&mdash;but I'm powerful 'fraid there
ain't no hope o' that."</p>

<p>"Nattee!" exclaimed Lawrence, rising quickly. "I
can't believe it; Rube, there's some mistake."</p>

<p>"Massa Larry, I tell ye I wish there wus&mdash;but there ain't
no chance o' it. She must ha' gone las' night. Her bed
ain't been slep' in, and here's her bundle Amen found
somewhere in the woods&mdash;an&mdash;he kin tell ye what he
knows."</p>

<p>Ralph, after the first moment, had sunk down into his
ordinary slouching attitude, and after fixing his wolfish eyes
for a moment on Amen, turned them to the floor, and
smoked on as if he neither heard nor saw. Larry, approaching 
the boy, with an appalling sternness bade him tell
shortly and truly all he knew, on pain of his heaviest displeasure.</p>

<p>Amen, thus adjured, began his statement of the night's
adventures, going back to Nattee's visit early in the evening, 
to the house of Mr. Pound, of which fact he had surreptitiously 
possessed himself, and upon which he had based
his suspicions of her fidelity. He related pretty clearly the
circumstances of his arousing, tracing her down the lane,
finding the wounded dog, and following her into the woods.
In fact, the only points, in all his narrative, in which he
deviated from the truth, were, first, as to the exact spot
where he had picked up the bundle; second, the distance he
had gone before he lost track of her; and third, the way

<!-- page 387 -->

and manner of his losing it. All which deviations were to
be referred solely to his desire to make himself out astonishingly 
fleet and dexterous in his pursuit, and to give his
audience the impression that all that could have been done
by one person had been done by him. So that, in reality,
he conveyed the idea that the fugitive was already beyond
pursuit, in the mountains above, guided and sheltered by
some of the Indians of her tribe.</p>

<p>Lawrence walked up and down the room with knit brow
and compressed lips, Warren leaned upon the table and
watched the narrator with an anxious face, and Laura
trembled and turned pale. Only the master of the house
showed no agitation and no interest, smoking his pipe and
swaying himself very slightly backward and forward as he
smoked. But when the boy had finished his story, and
had answered two or three hasty questions put to him by
Lawrence, and there had been a pause of several minutes,
the old man arose, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, laid it
on the shelf, and walking forward, rested both hands on
the table, and raised his eyes and fixed them on the group.</p>

<p>"Ye're likely niggers, all of ye," he said, in a slow,
deliberate voice, "likely niggers, and as quick to scent
your game as any Indian devil of 'em all. I turn ye out
into the woods this minute, to hunt 'em till ye find that
wench, and I trust ye to bring her back to me alive or
dead. He that does, has twenty pounds; he that leaves a
stone unturned, had better look to it that I don't find
it out. And he that in the smallest way shall favor her
escape, will have good cause to thank his luck if he comes
out alive from underneath the lash. <i>You</i>, saddle me

<!-- page 388 -->

Dirck, and <i>you</i>, make all the haste you can, 'cross lots to
Caspar's, and ask him how many men he'll spare me for
this business. Let Dave mount Jess, take the short cut
to Kiskatom, and put 'em on the scent. Neighbor Vandervleeck 
I'll see myself; Amen, stay where ye are till I give ye
leave to stir. Go now, the rest of ye&mdash;and lose no time."</p>

<p>The negroes slunk away quickly from his malignant eye,
to huddle together, frightened and uncertain, in the kitchen,
loathing and fearing their cruel errand, yet fearing more to
disregard it. Lawrence continued his quick walk up and
down the room, with a sterner and darker face than Laura
had ever seen him wear before. Warren got up, as his
uncle left the room, and following him, said:</p>

<p>"May I speak to you a moment, sir?"</p>

<p>As the door closed, Lawrence brought his walk to an
end. "This is a dreadful business, Laura," he said quickly.
"I must be before him&mdash;there is not a minute to lose.
You will tell mother about it&mdash;poor mother! I wish she
did not have to know!"</p>

<p>"But, Lawrence!" faltered Laura, as he embraced her,
"you must not go, you are not fit&mdash;it is madness"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My darling, I have no choice. If I were ten times
more unfit than I am now, I should have to go. You must
not mind&mdash;I will take care."</p>

And in a moment more, Laura was left alone by the
window, watching anxiously the hurried preparations at the
barn. Brown Bess, saddled and bridled, though, was the
first horse led out, and Lawrence, waving her an adieu,
galloped down the lane before old Ralph issued from the
house, spurred and booted for the chase.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the chase was destined to prove anything but satisfactory 
to its leader. A more diligent and thorough one
had never scoured the Five-Mile Woods, nor the adjacent
wilds above. Whatever reluctance the poor fugitive's own
comrades may have felt at assisting in the hunt for her, it
was fully overcome by their terror of their master's wrath,
and the neighboring negroes who were enlisted in the service 
had no scruples to overcome, and much to animate
them in the proposed reward. There was no stone left
unturned; the whole country, far and near, was beaten up;
neighbors were warned and placed on the lookout, and such
was the sympathy among those early advocates of the
peculiar institution, settled by the mother country upon the
colonies before they were old enough to choose for themselves, 
that one and all, for miles around, lent readily their
influence against the fugitive.</p>

Her chance seemed slim, indeed. Men, and dogs, and
horses were trampling down every inch of swamp and
thicket between the Sutherland farm and the outskirts of
the county; hunters, familiar with the mountains, were

<!-- page 390 -->

beating up every lair and cavern; bonfires blazed at night
from Round Top and Pine Orchard; no money, nor men,
nor vigilance was spared. If the price of the girl were
twice expended in her capture, Ralph Sutherland would
not have grudged the money, but he would not be balked
of his revenge. A most blood-thirsty rancor possessed
itself of him; all his evil passions went to feed it. This girl,
as the household favorite, had long been his aversion. He
saw that every member of it, Salome, perhaps, excepted,
longed to see him thwarted in recovering her, and at once
to torture his wife, startle the new comers, baffle Lawrence,
and strike awe into those who might be tainted by her
example, became his engrossing resolution.</p>

<p>And as the first night closed in, and the returning scouts
brought no intelligence of her capture, and the second day
was ending with no happier result, his resolution deepened
into a vindictive purpose, from which he vowed he never
would turn back. Alive or dead, he would again obtain
possession of her. It was Ahab lusting for the vineyard of
Naboth the Jezreelite; Haman loathing his life because of
Mordecai the Jew. It was nothing to him that she was a
chattel, easily replaced and personally indifferent to him;
that he was sinking all her worth upon this ill-starred
expedition; that she was below revenge; that he would be
none the richer, none the easier, when he had regained her.
His wicked life was drawing to that point that answers to
perfection; "his vices were unalloyed by a single virtue;"
he had got rid, it had begun to seem, of all mere human
frailty, and had become all over fiendish; and just at this
high point of sin, the Arch-Enemy himself deserted him, as

<!-- page 391 -->

he principally does his votaries, betraying them at last to
ruin by some most paltry, most transparent snare, and
leaving them to lead the horrible remnant of their ill-spent
lives stripped of the strength and courage he has till then
supplied.</p>

<p>Those two days were slow and dreadful ones to the
women who watched at home for the news they so much
feared. Poor Mrs. Sutherland was very much overcome
at the intelligence of her favorite's ungrateful flight; but
she had loved her too many years not to lose all resentment 
at her ingratitude, in solicitude for her safety, when
she came to see the heavy wrath brooding in her husband's
eyes. The most painful presentiments of evil, indeed, filled
the minds of all who saw him. He hardly tasted food, and
half the night his heavy tread across the chamber floor proclaimed 
his restless vigil.</p>

<p>Through the second day Mrs. Sutherland wandered about
the house like one in a dream, quite neglecting her ordinary
household duties, starting at every sound, and stealing to
the window to watch, trembling for the coming news. She
turned instinctively to Laura for support; but Laura, pale
and anxious, was suffering hardly less. Lawrence was gone
all day, and his return at night brought no encouragement,
except what could be gathered from the quiet resoluteness
of his manner, and the unshaken determination that his eye
expressed. It was a gloomy, gloomy evening, and the next
day was worthy of its fellowship. Little Steady went about
her work with red eyes and choking voice, and Salome,
triumphing in Nattee's downfall as she did, could not forbear 
a shivering apprehension of what must come upon her.

<!-- page 392 -->

The men straggled in at irregular intervals, and ate their
chance meal standing by the cupboard or sitting down
silent by the fireplace. All regular work was intermitted,
and a greater contrast to the usual noisy, merry kitchen,
could hardly be imagined than it now presented. They
talked in whispers of the strange event&mdash;the unaccountable
disappearance of all traces of her they sought, the wonderful 
fact of her long concealment, but the no less positive
certainty that sooner or later she must be found. Their
master's strength of will and unshrinking hardihood of purpose 
had impressed them more than anything else within
the range of their experience, and the half smothered conviction, 
which more than one among them cherished
secretly, that he was in league with the Evil One himself,
did not tend to raise their hopes for Nattee.</p>

<p>But of all the household, Warren, perhaps, suffered the
most acutely from this strange occurrence. His conscience,
refined and enlightened beyond that of any others who
were connected with the event, felt more keenly the many
sins that had gone to bring it about. Close contact with
such wickedness as his uncle's was unspeakable pain to one
who had the power to fathom it as he had; he shuddered
as he gazed down the black abyss, knowing too surely
where it ended. Nor had he spared to warn him of the
danger; but an angel from heaven could not have restrained
the old man then. And for his cousin, Warren had many
fears. How much he had to do with the present perversion
of right and order in the family, he could only conjecture;
but his self-will, and his imperious temper, seemed inevitably 
to Warren to be working out some heavy retribution

<!-- page 393 -->

for him. Perhaps, unacknowledged to himself, he had very
much the same fear in regard to the reward of his haughtiness 
and lofty looks that his brother in the ministry so
loudly proclaimed and prophesied, but softened by the
great affection he felt for him, and the strong hope he
had of some gentler way of change. But deep as was
his love for him, and entire as his admiration for the
thorough manliness and strength of his character, he could
not help seeing reliance on it had been his bane; it was
placing him at war with religion, and blinding him to
its inevitable, only, simple way to lasting peace and real
strength.</p>

<p>It seemed to Warren as if the household were all wrong&mdash;a 
good and prosperous edifice founded on shifting sands,
and surrounded by treacherous and engulphing seas. The
timid and fluttering faith of the poor mother had been the
only safeguard it had had thus far&mdash;the only charm that
had stayed the proud waves at its base; but now the storm
was rising in which it should be tried. Warren's thoughts
went back to the past&mdash;the purchase of this vast estate.
What was it but the reward of iniquity? What had every
year's record of it in heaven been but "the wicked in prosperity"&mdash;a 
house established in unrighteousness? He
could not keep his faith and not feel apprehension for its
future.</p>

<p>But the sins of others, though they oppressed and saddened 
him, did not form the burden, he knew, appointed to
him to bear. He realized most bitterly he had had a part
to fill, since he had been a member of this family, that he
had filled but tamely and lukewarmly. If he had felt as

<!-- page 394 -->

strongly as he had seen clearly the dangers by which they
were surrounded, would he have laid his plans so quietly
and gone to work so calmly? Would he not rather have
had the zeal and fervor of him he had looked upon with
something like contempt? Would he have spared day or
night to tell them of their errors? Would he have trusted
so much to time, and the working of his system? Ah! but
a little flock had been committed to his care, and here was
one lost already. How should he answer, at the great day
of account, for that neglect? How would that wail cry
forever in his ears! He had prayed for her&mdash;he had
striven silently to reach her heart; but had he put the passion 
into his prayers, the earnestness into his efforts that he
would have done if her mortal body, instead of her immortal 
soul, had been in danger of perishing before his eyes?
How cold and dead his faith must be, never to have
awakened him before to this dreadful possibility. Whole
days and nights of prayer and self-abasement seemed utterly
powerless to express his deep contrition, as they were
incompetent to atone for his omissions, but a truer penitent
than he never strove to humble soul and body before
heaven, and to bring both down to the dust. Very little,
the rest of the family would have said, he had to reproach
himself with, in this or any other matter, saintly, self-denying, 
devotional, as his whole life seemed to them.
They never guessed the tortures of self-reproach and penitence 
that he was passing through during those two days
of miserable suspense, and he never dreamed in what
esteem they held his life; but it is well, perhaps, both for
themselves and others, that, as Bishop Taylor says, while

<!-- page 395 -->

the saints are like lanterns in the world, the dark side is
toward themselves.</p>

<p>It was nothing of unusual occurrence, when that evening
after supper, some one inquired "Where's Warren?" that
Laura answered, "he is at the chapel, and told me not to
expect him home to-night."</p>

<p>The little vestry room had latterly become his favorite
retreat, a great proportion of his books were there;
Rube's care had supplied him with an inexhaustible supply
of dry and easily kindled wood, and the isolation and
dreariness of the spot were so much to his taste, that there
seemed a danger of his being too much in love with his
little hermitage, and shunning the home circle more than
accorded with his duty. At first, Laura had dreadful
dreams when he did not come back at night, and his aunt
remonstrated earnestly. But he soon convinced them he
was more comfortable there; there was no fireplace in his
own room at home, and he could accomplish twice as much
study over there alone, as when he attempted it in the
sitting-room among the family circle. And it was much
more exposing and uncomfortable to walk back late at
night through the woods, than to throw himself upon the
little lounge beside the fire, and sleep till morning. To all
this they finally gave in, and it was now a regular thing for
Warren to leave them after supper, as often as three nights
in the week, and not to return again till breakfast time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutherland, however, looked up uneasily that evening, 
and said:</p>

<p>"Has Warren gone without his supper? I must send
him some."</p>

<!-- page 396 -->

<p>"I don't think he wants any, dear aunt," said Laura,
listlessly, sitting by the window and looking earnestly for
some sign of Lawrence's return.</p>

<p>"Steady must surely take some over to him though," her
aunt returned, glad, perhaps, of something to divert her
thoughts momentarily from their gloomy source of anxiety.
She busied herself about preparing something for him,
and filling a little basket, set it down out in the hall,
telling Steady to hurry through her work and take it to
him, and then did not give the subject another thought.
It was very unlike Mrs. Sutherland to give so careless a
direction; she would, at any other time, have reflected
that by the time little Steady had completed her unusually
heavy work, removed the supper, and arranged the room,
it would be perfectly dark, and every way unfit to send her
out into the woods. But in truth the poor lady's mind was
so absorbed with her anxieties and apprehensions, that she
did not give the matter a second thought, and did not even
miss Steady, when, an hour later, the child, with trembling
hands, tied on her hood, grasped the basket, and stole out
into the night. She was not habitually timid, but she would
have been more than human, if, in those superstitious days,
and among those ignorant dependents, she had not caught
something of their terror of the darkness. The horrid
stories that were whispered round the kitchen fire at
night did not lose any of their effect upon her mind,
because they were not intended to meet her ear. She said
her prayers, poor little woman, over and over, as she
hurried along toward the dreaded woods, and past her own
deserted little home, and tried not to think of what Salome

<!-- page 397 -->

said, and what Dave saw further on, and where it was Joe
heard that awful groan.</p>

<p>She knew the path so well, it was not very hard for her
to keep it, notwithstanding the darkness and her fears;
she never thought of turning back, the possibility of not
doing as she had been told to do had never occurred to her
mind; the most she dared do was to wish the wood were
shorter, and to hope Mr. Warren would not send her back
alone. At last, however, she emerged from them upon
the open hill, and caught the glimmer of a light from the
little vestry room window.</p>

<p>The woods behind the chapel looked very black indeed,
but the sky, now she was used to the darkness, was nearer
to a pallid grey than the black she had supposed. Ah!
And there was that solitary grave, of which no one had
as yet taught her any fear, and the little wreath of <i>immortelles</i>
that had hung upon it since All Saints. There was
light enough to see it quite distinctly, and she stopped a
moment by it, resting her hands upon it, serious and subdued. 
Mr. Warren had taught her to say, "I believe in
the Communion of Saints," when she stood by her father's
grave, and to repeat part of the thirty-ninth Psalm. The
obedient little formalist did not forget his teaching; it
had been her faithful service every time she had come
there since his burial. And, half aloud, half in a whisper,
she repeated the solemn words of the funeral anthem,
made forever holy in her ears since that sad day. Poor
child, there was more pathos in her recital of those last
verses than she guessed, more meaning in them than she
had learned to read:</p>

<!-- page 398 -->

<p>"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with Thine ears consider
my calling; hold not Thy peace at my tears:</p>

<p>"For I am a stranger with Thee, and a sojourner as all
my fathers were.</p>

<p>"O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength before 
I go hence and be no more seen."</p>

<p>When Mr. Warren, starting up at her low knock, opened
the door, he met Steadfast's own serious, literal eyes, as sober 
and unagitated as if she had been standing by the
cheerful fireside of her home.</p>

<p>"Steady!" he exclaimed in wonder, admitting her, "what
are you doing here this dark night? Did any one come
with you?"</p>

<p>A few words explained her story, and Mr. Warren
passed his hand kindly over her brown hair, as he said:</p>

<p>"You are a little Steadfast, there is no room for doubt.
How did you like coming through the woods?"</p>

<p>"I didn't like it, Mr. Warren, I ran."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that, Steady. I should like to think
you were not afraid."</p>

<p>"But I was, Mr. Warren."</p>

<p>"You'll know better one of these days, I hope, Steady.
However, I cannot send you back alone. Sit down there
on that bench by the fire, while I finish what I am about,
and then I will take you home."</p>

<p>It was quite a self-denial to him to give up his quiet
night, but he could not think of letting the child go back
alone at such an hour, and with such wild doings in the
woods as they had lately witnessed: so while she sat
demurely down beside the fire, Warren hurried to finish

<!-- page 399 -->

the abstract he was making, preparatory to putting up his
books and extinguishing his light and fire. She was so
quiet, however, that in a few moments he forgot her presence, 
and became entirely absorbed in his pursuit.</p>

<p>A half hour perhaps passed by before he was recalled to
what he had promised to do, by the sight of her. A slight
unusual noise, as of something softly slid along the stone
floor of the chapel, had caused him to look up. There lay
Steady, however, fast asleep upon the hearth, with her
arms upon the bench, innocent of any movement, quiet as a
shadow.</p>

<p>"It must have been my fancy," Warren thought, as he
resumed his writing. Presently something like it came
again.</p>

<p>"It is no fancy now," he thought, laying down his pen
and listening. But there succeeded such a silence he began
again to doubt himself.</p>

<p>Whether fancied or real, however, it had effectually
broken up his train of thought; so closing his books, he
pushed them back, and leaned his head upon his hands.
The isolation and dreariness of the place came over him
very strongly as, for the moment, he listened to the wind
sighing through the trees outside, and looked at the sleeping 
child and the dying fire within. Perhaps, also, weakened 
by his long fast, and his recent strong emotions,
he listened a little more to the whisperings of fancy and
the suggestions of the hour than he was apt to do. The
sight of the quiet little sleeper, too, perhaps, recalled the
sad event that on this spot had made her friendless and
orphaned, and had left her so peculiarly in his care.</p>

<!-- page 400 -->

<p>"If I neglect you too, poor baby!" he said, with a
groan, covering his eyes with his hands. Mark's sad, reproachful 
face came before him, mixed with the memory
of poor Nattee's eager, wistful eyes, as he had caught
them fixed on him during the All Saints sermon; and he
felt, for one dreadful moment, a faint foretaste of that pang
that at the very gates of Heaven even the righteous must
endure, as, entering them, he parts forever from the lost
multitudes without, and, looking back, catches on the
ghastly faces gazing after him, despair, reproach, and
anguish. It came upon him so suddenly and vividly that
when he raised his head his forehead was wet, and his
cheek ashy pale. He conquered himself with effort, and
rising, walked hurriedly back and forth across the narrow
room.</p>

<p>"Good Master! help me to remember it!" he murmured;
"help me to keep the vow I make, never to forget that vision,
never to suffer it to pale. I will bind it as frontlets between
my eyes; I will write it on my heart; I will think upon it
lying down and rising up; I will work to save the souls of
men as I would wish I had worked at that day; I will wish
myself accursed from Christ if by my means the lowest of
my brethren be; I will pray never to be admitted to those
holy courts if there must be shut out one soul whom I have
failed to warn, one wretch whose eyes can turn reproachfully 
on me!"</p>

<p>He went into the chapel, and throwing himself upon his
knees, bowed his face upon the chancel rail, and remained
in that altitude for a long, long while. When at length he
rose he found himself utterly in darkness, the vestry-room

<!-- page 401 -->

door had fallen shut after him, and so little light was there
outside that he could hardly trace the outline of the windows 
in the wall. He descended the three steps that led
up to the chancel and tried to grope his way toward the
vestry-room. He could see the light under the crack of the
door and was going toward it, when his foot struck on
some obstruction on the floor, which, stooping down, he
discovered, with a chill of undefinable alarm, was one of the
flat stones that paved the aisle, half raised from its place,
and lying with its edge upon the next in order to it.</p>

<p>This accounted instantly for the strange noise that had
aroused him from his studies&mdash;it had not been fancy, after
all. He now remembered rapidly, this stone had been left
loose as a sort of entrance, if there should ever be necessity,
to the excavation underneath the chapel. The heavy spring
rains, it had been feared, might at some time undermine it,
and the precaution had been taken to leave some way open
to examine occasionally into the state of the foundations.
Warren was not given to superstition, neither was he easily
brought under the power of material terrors, but he could
not help acknowledging there was a look about this
that he did not like. What companion might he not have
had here during his solitary vigils! What guilt might not
have hidden there while the little congregation worshipped
quietly above! Surely no purpose but an evil one could
prompt such secrecy and the choice of such a spot. These
thoughts suggested themselves to him in rapid succession,
as he made his way to the vestry-room door. He pushed it
open, and a flood of light streamed across the chapel. He
followed rapidly with his eye its illuminating path till it

<!-- page 402 -->

showed him, crouching down against the wall, and clinging
to the chancel rail, the figure of a woman.</p>

<p>He started involuntarily, then said in a low, strange voice,
coming toward her after an instant's pause:</p>

<p>"Nattee! is it you? I have just been praying for you."</p>

<p>Yes, it was Nattee; but what a wreck, what a transformation! 
Warren's heart smote him as the figure of the lithe
pretty mulatto girl rose up in his recollection and placed
itself beside this haggard, wild-eyed fugitive. Her cheeks
were sunken, her mouth had that ghastly, inexpressive look
that comes from protracted pain of mind and body, and her
eyes were those of a hunted wild beast. The torn and tattered 
dress that hung about her, the heavy, straight, black
hair falling about her shoulders, the stains upon her neck
and arms&mdash;what a contrast to the trim and tidy maid of one
short week ago!</p>

<p>"Nattee," said the clergyman, as she shrunk away at
his approach, "you need not be afraid of me; have I not
always showed myself your friend?"</p>

<p>"Nobody is that now," she murmured in a strange, hollow 
voice, averting her face from him. He sat down on the
chancel steps a little way from her, and resting his arm upon
the rail, bent slightly forward and looked at her with earnestness.</p>

<p>"We are all better friends to you than you are to yourself, 
my poor girl. You have been listening to evil counsels, 
and have been nearly destroyed by them; but I thank
God, He has brought you back and kept you from the ruin
they designed."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Warren went on: "It is not

<!-- page 403 -->

the destruction and danger of your body that I mean, Nattee; 
it is the peril to your soul. If you were a thousand
miles from here to-night, secure in ease and comfort, you
would be in more real danger than you are now in this
place, for you would be further from a state of repentance;
you would not have it in your power to atone for your sin
as you have it now. Oh, Nattee, my poor girl! if you
knew how I had prayed for you! How I had wept for
you! I believe God has heard me, after all. I believe He
has sent me here to-night to tell you He forgives you, and
loves you, and will receive you as His child forever. Oh,
Nattee! take this great mercy! Throw yourself down at
His feet and ask Him to forgive you, and save you and direct
you! You don't know how much better the service of God
is, than all the freedom of the world. You would never
hesitate between them if you did."</p>

<p>An inarticulate ejaculation of despair escaped her as she
buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"I know what you would say, Nattee: you would say
you did not have the choice; no one told you of God's service, 
and you had no chance of trying the freedom that the
world enjoys. I take shame to myself for the first, but for
last, depend upon it, you are best without it, since God did
not give it to you. And He does not willingly afflict or
grieve the children of men: like as a father pitieth his own
children, so is the Lord merciful to them that fear Him.
Think how hard it must be for Him to punish us, Nattee;
think how He is pitying you to-night, how He has pitied you
through all these dreadful days. How it must grieve Him
that you have gone wrong and turned away from your duty."</p>

<!-- page 404 -->

<p>"I couldn't go any way that wasn't wrong," she cried,
with a sudden flame of desperation; "it was all miserable
and tangled, every way. Some told me this way was right,
and some told me that way was right, and God didn't tell
me how to choose. Oh, why won't they let me alone!
Why won't they let me die and be out of their way forever!"</p>

<p>Warren waited till the burst of passion that followed this
had subsided a little, and then said quietly: "You say
God didn't tell you how to choose; perhaps He is telling
you now. Perhaps He is showing you how hard the way
of transgression is, and how little happiness is gained by
going out of the way of duty after it. Perhaps He means
to bring you back to the right way by making the wrong
way seem hard. Do not think I blame you, Nattee; my
heart aches for you, poor child! I know it is ignorance and
misfortune that has led you into sin. Listen to me now,
and answer me afterward if you do not think I am right;
if your heart does not tell you I am speaking truth and justice. 
Somebody has made you believe, Nattee, somebody
kind and well-meaning, too, but terribly mistaken, in his
kindness, that you are wronged and injured by being held
to service without your own consent; that your rights are
trampled on by being placed in charge of another, not
given to yourself. Well, if this man who tells you so is
right, how many wise and righteous men are very wrong,
who tell a totally different story. They take it for granted
that God, putting you by birth into a certain station
in life, knew it was the best one for your soul's salvation
(souls are to live forever, Nattee, and bodies live but

<!-- page 405 -->

a little while); and so, instead of quarrelling with Him for
putting you in it, or with your master for keeping you in
it, they go to work to help you to make the best of it while
you are in it. They tell you to be humble and not think
you deserve a better lot than has been assigned to you;
every minute of our Great Master's life was a lesson of uncomplaining 
humbleness. They tell you to be patient, and
to remember that your light affliction, which endures but for
a moment, will one day work out for you a far more exceeding 
weight of glory, to be your portion through all eternity.
They tell you to be just and reasonable, and not to look for
what never happens to the children of men&mdash;freedom from
a yoke more or less hard, and a discipline more or less uneasy 
to flesh and blood. They tell you there is no man
living whom God does not chastise in some way; some He
binds whole years to beds of pain, wasting them with pining 
sickness; from some He takes away all hope and happiness, 
and leaves them bare of everything but freedom;
others drag out their lives in such disappointment, misery
and gloom, that they long wearily for the end; toil and
anxiety and ill success make many a freeman's nights and
days harder and longer than the weariest slave's that ever
worked. And all for the saving of their souls; all to accomplish 
the work that the Son of God began for them upon the
Cross. He did His part in our salvation patiently, but it is
lost to us if we are impatient of the part we have to do ourselves. 
I have never found but one way to peace, and that is,
the way of submission. In the matters of our souls and of
our bodies, in the affairs of this world and in the mysteries
of the next, I know no wisdom so sure as God's wisdom;

<!-- page 406 -->

no will so powerful, no heart so merciful, as His. Leave it all
to Him, both rewards and punishments; our thinking about
their justness can do us no possible advantage: just or unjust, 
the dealing of them lies with God, and always will lie
with Him. What remains for us&mdash;for you and me, Nattee&mdash;is 
submission to His will, patience under His hand. Tell
me, is there any&mdash;any other way?"</p>

<p>Nattee made a broken murmur of assent, but did not
raise her head, and after a pause, Warren went on speaking: 
"Perhaps what I have said is not so pleasant to
believe as the advice others have given to you, but believe
me, Nattee, it is nearer to the truth. No one pities you
more than I do, no one longs more to see you happy, but I
cannot tell you wrong is right&mdash;I cannot let my pity come
between me and my duty. You are one of those placed in
my care, one of those whom I am bound to teach. I am
obliged, if I see you do wrong, to tell you of it, and to
show you what is right. Nor must you think it hard in
me, and cruel, if I tell you that your duty is plainly this&mdash;to 
go back to your master, acknowledge you have done
amiss, and submit to any punishment he may choose to lay
upon you."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't&mdash;oh, Master Warren&mdash;don't say I must
go back!" cried Nattee, shuddering.</p>

<p>"But I must say that, Nattee, I dare not say anything
different. I should be conspiring with you to commit a
robbery if I did. For your time, your labor is not your
own; the laws of the land give it to your master. He
has given you a home, protection, subsistence, from your
infancy&mdash;you are bound to give him through your life,

<!-- page 407 -->

your service in return. If this seems hard, do not blame
him&mdash;do not blame me. The laws of a great, just, Christian
kingdom sanction it; and we are bound to respect them
till we are empowered to change them. I know, Nattee,
you have not a kind master, but neither has your mistress
a kind husband, nor Mr. Lawrence a kind father, and yet
they have never, to my knowledge, rebelled against his
government. He has been severe with you, but never, I
believe, sufficiently so to justify your leaving him. I can
regret this very much, but I cannot see it has any remedy
but patience. The uneasiness of our relations to each other
in this world alone cannot sanction our dissolving them; if
it could, think of the misrule that would soon prevail&mdash;children 
breaking away from parents, servants from masters, 
wives from husbands, subjects from rulers. And
believe me, Nattee, the lot of those in your station is far
less sad than you have recently been taught to think. You
have the same moral rights that others have, the same relation 
to God, the same title to salvation. The faithful performance 
of your duty will win the same reward from
heaven, the same respect from men; what do you lack but
the grant of personal, present freedom, the privilege of
going where you please, doing what you please, subject to
no will but your own. It is a privilege, I grant&mdash;a great
privilege; but besides slaves, many&mdash;wives, children, apprentices, 
soldiers&mdash;have to be guided by the will of others;
the proportion of those who are appointed to guide and
direct themselves, is very small. This thing of liberty, considered 
by itself, is not so indispensable to happiness after
all. Tell me, Nattee, had you ever thought about it&mdash;ever

<!-- page 408 -->

longed for it&mdash;before you were pitied and condoled with
for the want of it?"</p>

<p>"No," said the poor girl, hesitatingly; "I don't think
I used to mind&mdash;I don't remember whether I knew anything 
about it then."</p>

<p>"Then, Nattee, the best thing for you to do is to go
back to the way of those happier days, and forget all you
have heard about it since, and be as you were then, only
wiser and faithfuller."</p>

<p>"I can't go back to those days," poor Nattee murmured,
with fresh tears. "I can't be like I was then&mdash;I don't
expect to be happy again, ever, but I want to do what's
right, even if it's hard&mdash;I want&mdash;I want to get God to forgive 
me."</p>

<p>"Then, my poor girl, God is ready to forgive you. He
is ready to help you to do His will, if you are ready to give
up your own."</p>

<p>"I haven't got any will of my own any more. I'm so
miserable I don't care what becomes of me. I'd rather die
if God will let me&mdash;but I'll try to bear it if I have to live.
Oh, Master Warren! if you only knew how I've tried to
find out what it all means! how I've wanted to be good&mdash;you'd 
help me&mdash;I know you would."</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands with a passionate gesture,
and went on, hurriedly: "I don't know how to pray; I
don't know how to make God hear; I haven't got any
words that's fit&mdash;but my heart is breaking&mdash;I shall die if
He don't listen, I shall die if He don't help me&mdash;I'm afraid
of all my sins&mdash;I don't know where to go."</p>

<p>"Our merciful Saviour says, 'He that cometh to me I

<!-- page 409 -->

will in no wise cast out.' Is it not to Him you ought
to go?"</p>

<p>"But I don't know how, I don't know what to say. I
haven't been baptized and made a Christian&mdash;how can I
know He'll hear me till I am?"</p>

<p>"Has any one ever told you about baptism, Nattee? do
you know what is required of persons who come to be baptized?" 
asked Warren, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I heard you talking about it to the men, one day, and
I've listened when Miss Laura's been teaching Steady&mdash;perhaps 
I don't understand&mdash;but, oh"&mdash;&mdash; She stopped with
a bewildered, wistful look.</p>

<p>"If you understand, you mean you wish you were baptized 
yourself?"</p>

<p>She gave an eager, anxious motion of assent, and Warren
said:</p>

<p>"Listen, then, and I will make you understand it. You
believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and that He died to save
you, and lives now, and knows and watches you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I believed that long ago."</p>

<p>"And you are heartily sorry for your sins?"</p>

<p>With a groan she turned her face away, and said: "Yes,
I'm worse'n sorry."</p>

<p>"And you know He is the only One who can forgive
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it."</p>

<p>"And you want to be better, and to serve God faithfully, 
and to keep His commandments honestly?"</p>

<p>"If He will only help me!"</p>

<p>"Then, Nattee, I know no reason why you should not

<!-- page 410 -->

be baptized. It is your only safety, and I dare not refuse
it to you, even though you have not been instructed for it.
Come to me to-morrow"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow," she interrupted, hastily. "Why must
you wait till then?&mdash;why don't you save me now, to-night?
Oh, Mr. Warren, you don't know what may happen&mdash;perhaps 
I may die before to-morrow&mdash;perhaps you won't be
here yourself&mdash;perhaps they won't let you. You don't
know, and I am afraid to wait&mdash;I am so afraid. You won't
turn me away from what's to save me&mdash;you won't keep
away from me what God says I have a right to. Oh, Mr.
Warren! think how you would feel&mdash;think how awfully
sorry you would be"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Warren turned hastily away from her, and paced the
aisle thoughtfully for a minute or two, while she watched
him anxiously. At length he approached her, and said:</p>

<p>"You shall have your wish, Nattee, I will baptize you
now. Kneel down and say your prayers till I come back."</p>

<p>At the vestry-room door he paused, for Steady, wide-awake 
and wondering, stood listening beside the fire.
"Steady," he said, taking her by the hand, "You have
heard what Nattee says, and I am going to baptize her
now. You and I shall have to be her witnesses, and remember 
you pray for her with all your heart."</p>

<p>The first baptism in the chapel was a strange and
solemn one. The light that little Steady held was not
strong enough to make anything but dim and flickering
shadows about the building; all was shrouded in darkness,
or at best, uncertainty, save the three figures around the
font. The silence and reverence of the little torch-bearer,

<!-- page 411 -->

the abject posture of the poor penitent, the spirituality and
purity of the young priest's face&mdash;carried the fancy back a
thousand years and more, to the dim and dripping vaults
of Rome, where the early Christians celebrated in solemnity
and secrecy their holy rites. There was an actual vitality
in the words as they fell upon the silent air; there was a
startling reality in every gesture, as if, indeed, a fresh soul,
delivered from wrath, were being admitted, in the sight of
men and angels, into the second ark, Christ's Church,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Therein to float<br/>

Over the billows of this troublesome world,<br/>

To the fair land of everlasting rest."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Familiarity and security had not brought down their faith
to the level of their sight; to them it was not merely the
prescribed mode of entrance into a religious life, more or
less important as an act of obedience and submission; but
it was the mystical washing away of sin, the regeneration
to another life, the adoption to sonship, the title to the
kingdom of Heaven. Believing in their souls what easier
Christians do but assent to with their lips, it was unto
them according to their faith; that which they asked
believing they received.</p>

<p>Little Steady, in her simplicity of faith, almost looked to
have seen the cross traced still in living light on her companion's 
forehead, when she raised her reverent eyes as
Warren's voice ceased; but Nattee's face was hidden in her
hands&mdash;her whole attitude spoke only passionate self-abasement 
and repentance.</p>

<p>"Christ's soldier till her dying day," why should she be

<!-- page 412 -->

afraid? And Steady looked wistfully up to Warren for
triumphant assurance that the words conveyed. She found
it on his upraised face, but chastened and subdued by
knowledge to which she had not yet attained. It was,
indeed, no wonder the child gazed spell-bound and half
awed; the young minister stood with one hand on the stone
edge of the font, the other lifted over the kneeling penitent.
All the light in the dark chapel seemed to radiate from the
folds of his white surplice, and a glory truly rested on his
face&mdash;not the glory of ecstasy and triumph, but the glory
of a holy confidence, and a faith that burned steadier and
stiller for the storms that had passed over it.</p>

<p>When the little sacristan had put out the light, re-covered
the font, and replaced the books, she went back into the
vestry-room, and found Nattee standing, downcast and
trembling, by the outer door, and Warren talking to her
earnestly.</p>

<p>"What would another night's shelter be, Nattee? I
could not give it to you without offence to my own conscience, 
and it could do you no possible good. Go back to
your master, surrender yourself voluntarily to him, compelled 
by none; it is the surest way to disarm him of his
anger. My presence would only hurt your cause&mdash;it would
seem as if I had discovered you and forced you to return.
I know how hard it is, my poor girl; but do not shrink
from the first hard step in your Christian life. Remember
baptism doth represent unto us our profession, which is to
follow the example of our Saviour, Christ, and to be made
like unto Him. And you are dead, I trust, to sin; rise
now to righteousness and strength; mortify your evil fears

<!-- page 413 -->

and your corrupt inclinings, and follow the right path, even
if it lead you to your death. Nattee! coward flesh and
blood has had a brave example. Think of Him who
counted not His life dear unto Himself, so He might serve
you, and do not count your sufferings dear, when you are
called upon in your turn to serve Him. Do not hesitate,
my girl; do not give the devil credit for a moment. He
will assault you worse than ever, now; but remember Whose
you are, and Whom you serve."</p>

<p>"I do remember," whispered Nattee, creeping toward
the door. "I am going, Mr. Warren&mdash;I am truly going;
but, oh! if I could only wait till morning!"</p>

<p>"Nattee! who put that thought into your mind? Who
is always coaxing us to put our duties off until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>The poor girl shuddered, and then giving one wistful
look back at her instructor, raised the latchet of the door.</p>

<p>"Steady will go with you," he said, as the little girl
obeyed his gesture, and held out her hand. Nattee took it
mechanically, and grasped it tightly, as she stepped out into
the darkness.</p>

<p>Warren's heart ached, as, with a low benediction, he
closed the door upon them.</p>

<p>"Innocence and Penitence," he murmured, "I have a
right to think God will protect them both."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> distrusting God's providence, however, the
remaining hours of that night were anxious and troubled
ones to Warren. There are few men so assured and well-balanced 
as to be unaffected by the reaction that invariably
succeeds a prompt and irrevocable decision; the resolution
and intrepidity that carry them beyond the turning-point
generally desert them as soon as they have passed it, and
leave them a prey to doubts and misgivings of the most
tormenting kind.</p>

<p>"I could have done no otherwise," thought Warren, as
he paced the floor. "I can't think I could ever have reconciled 
it to my conscience, to have connived at her concealment 
even for a day; but it is a horrible thing to have sent
her back unguarded to the cruelty of that infuriated man;
it is almost more than I can bear, to think what she may be
passing through, even now. Would it not have been better
to have tempered my rigidity a little&mdash;to have gone myself
to him, and told him of her return? But in his present

<!-- page 415 -->

state, nothing from me would be received&mdash;it would only
have irritated him the more bitterly against her. To Lawrence 
I could not have sent her; my judgment warns me,
the less she owes to him the better; and the intercession
of her mistress would be worse than useless to her. Still,
it was a hard alternative. God forgive me if there was too
little pity in the measure that I dealt her!"</p>

<p>At the end of two hours, unable to bear the anxiety till
morning, he resolved upon going to the house, and ascertaining 
what her reception had been. But upon reaching it,
he found everything in darkness and quiet&mdash;not a light anywhere 
about the place; and reassured by its appearance of
tranquillity, he resolved to return to the chapel for the
remainder of the night, and not risk arousing any of the
family by attempting to enter and to reach his own apartment. 
The worst was past, he had no doubt, and poor
Nattee was ere now safe in her little room, wretched enough,
assuredly, but through the hardest of her punishment, and
in the way of reaching contentment and security. He
returned to his little hermitage, and worn out by his long
and anxious watch, he threw himself upon the lounge, and
slept till a late hour the following morning.</p>

<p>He approached the house with a feeling of some uneasiness, 
not diminished by the sight of his uncle mounted on
Grey Dirck, coming rapidly down the lane. The old man
passed him with no token of recognition beyond an angry
scowl; certainly, there was not much encouragement for
Nattee's cause in that vindictive face. He hurried into the
house, and was met at the sitting-room door by Laura, pale
and in tears.</p>

<!-- page 416 -->

<p>"Oh, Warren!" she whispered, "we have had such an
awful scene. I don't dare to think about my little Steady;
he has whipped her terribly, and locked her up in his own
room, and gone away"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And Nattee?" said Warren, quickly.</p>

<p>"That is what I am going to tell you&mdash;it is all about poor
Nattee. It seems she has been heard of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"She has not come back?"</p>

<p>"Come back? Oh, no! but&mdash;Warren, what's the matter? 
Oh, I'm sure you're ill!"</p>

<p>His sudden paleness had so unnerved her that she could
with difficulty obey his entreaty to go on.</p>

<p>"Come in here," he said, leading her to his room, "and
tell me all they know about this miserable girl."</p>

<p>Laura's story was but a short one: it appeared that some
informant (Amen, probably, for he seemed at the bottom
of all poor Nattee's troubles) had brought at daylight the
intelligence that a strip of linsey-woolsey, evidently freshly
torn, had been found in the vicinity of Mark's little cottage,
and that Steady had returned home from that direction late
in the evening, and had stolen up to bed without a word to
any one. Steady was sent for, and a terrible interview had
taken place. The little girl had refused to answer any questions; 
no threats had been effectual in extracting anything
from her beyond the acknowledgment that she had gone
over the hill to carry Mr. Warren's supper, and that she
had come back late, and had gone straight to bed without
stopping in the kitchen. It was impossible to call her stubborn, 
she was so manifestly terrified; she was evidently
braving her master's vengeance, from nothing but the

<!-- page 417 -->

straightforward sense of duty that had governed all her
life. Ralph's rage seemed perfectly to master him; the
child's self-control and endurance and his ungovernable
passion formed a strange contrast, though through it all, it
was easy to see she was half dead with terror.</p>

<p>Only once, when he was beating her unmercifully, Laura
had heard her call out for Master Warren, begging him to
save her, and to tell her master that it hadn't been her
fault. This involuntary error the poor little child had paid
dearly for, however, for Ralph, roused by fresh suspicions,
had inflicted fresh cruelties upon her to oblige her to confirm 
them, but in vain, and at length had dragged her off
to his own room to find what virtue there might be in the
dark-closet system. The result, of course, Laura could only
guess at; her uncle's face had expressed neither satisfaction
nor enlightenment as he turned the key upon the little
captive, and strode off to the barn, and Laura had little 
doubt she had remained faithful to her trust, whatever the
trust might be.</p>

<p>Lawrence had been off an hour or more, since first he
heard the story, hoping to be before his father in Nattee's
apprehension, if indeed she really were about the neighborhood. 
Amen's representations had led to the belief that in
the course of the first night of her flight, she had accomplished 
a great distance, and was, without doubt, many
miles beyond the farm before pursuit was started. This
idea, of course, had saved the chapel from a rigorous
examination; though Ralph had ridden over there and
looked into it, he had done it idly and without the smallest
anticipation of discovering any traces of her. He had

<!-- page 418 -->

walked up and down the aisle, and had lifted the altar-cloth,
and looked under the altar, and poor Nattee had heard his
heavy tread echoing upon the stones under which she lay,
and had heard the crack of that dreadful riding-whip as he
mounted and rode off. But now that her presence in the
vicinity was so strongly suspected, the whole force of the
investigation would be brought to bear upon so small a
space, Warren could not help confessing, her chances of
escape were less than insignificant.</p>

<p>If he could but see Steady for a moment and ascertain the
truth from her, there might be some chance of bringing the
poor wretch again to reason, and saving her from the fate
with which she seemed so much in love. But Warren's
conscience, though a high church conscience, had no affinity
to Jesuitism; doing wrong that right might come was
utterly at variance with its promptings. He knew too well
his own position in the family and his duty to the head of it,
to attempt to obtain an interview with his little protegee by
violating his uncle's orders. Moreover, it could not be
done without forcibly breaking into the room where she
was confined, and setting an example of insubordination and
violence that would do far more evil to the others, than by
his influence with Nattee he could hope to do her good.
Meantime, he must bear patiently the suspense and the
anxiety, and trust that, as he could do nothing, all would
yet work well without him.</p>

<p>A long and anxious day it was, as had been its predecessors. 
Everything was unsettled and uncomfortable in the
household, now that Steady too was gone, and that poor
Mrs. Sutherland had so little heart for its direction. Salome
could not keep her mind upon her work, and if Laura had

<!-- page 419 -->

not tried to interest herself in the matters of the <i>m&eacute;nage</i>,
it would have been at a dead stand-still.</p>

<p>Toward evening Ralph returned; supper was on the
table, but he did not even make a feint of partaking of it.
He had evidently something of engrossing weight upon his
mind, some new and definite plan before him. He even
forgot little Steady's incarceration, till timidly reminded of
it by Laura, just as he was leaving the house. He looked
at her a moment scowlingly, then tossed her the key and
went out.</p>

<p>Laura ran joyfully to emancipate the little captive, whom
she found sitting on a bag of wool far back in a dark closet,
with her hands folded and her face expressing its usual
tranquillity. Her eyes blinked a little when Laura hurried
her out into the light, and she was somewhat paler than
ordinary; but beyond that, she was far less moved than
her mistress.</p>

<p>"Mr. Warren wants you, Steady," said the latter, taking
her by the hand. "Come with me to his room."</p>

<p>Steady followed, and Laura responded to his permission
to enter by opening the door, pushing Steady through it,
and retreating. Warren's face lighted up as he saw the
child, and laying aside his book, he went to meet her, saying, 
"What does all this mean that I have heard, Steady?
Why would not you mind your master this morning?"</p>

<p>Steady hung her head: "It wasn't my fault, Mr. Warren,
How could I break my word to Nattee?"</p>

<p>"But how came you to pass your word to Nattee when
you knew that she was doing wrong?" said Warren, seating
himself and drawing the child beside his knee.</p>

<!-- page 420 -->

<p>"She coaxed me, Mr. Warren, and I was frightened;
besides, I didn't know it wasn't right. She said she would
come back by daylight&mdash;he said she might if she had a
mind to."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pound, you mean?"</p>

<p>Steady nodded.</p>

<p>"Where did you meet Mr. Pound, Steady?"</p>

<p>"Right there by our old house, Mr. Warren."</p>

<p>"Was Nattee surprised to see him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She didn't want to, she tried to hide
away from him; but she couldn't, and he saw her, and <i>he</i>
was surprised."</p>

<p>"What did he say&mdash;do you remember?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'Nattee, what does this mean?' And he
pointed to me, Nattee began to cry, and made me go
away, and they talked low a long, long time, and then
Nattee came to me and told me she was going to let me go
home alone to-night, but she was coming early in the
morning; and then she made me promise solemnly I
wouldn't tell anybody I'd seen her or knew anything about
her. And I didn't know, and I promised."</p>

<p>"I understand, Steady. You did not do anything
wrong, you could not help it. And so you came home?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I came 'cross lots as fast as ever I could."</p>

<p>"And they&mdash;which way did they go?"</p>

<p>"Along the road to Mr. Pound's, I think; but I'm not
sure."</p>

<p>"That's enough then. Steady. You may go and get
your supper. I think for the present you had better keep
your promise to Nattee, and not say anything about what

<!-- page 421 -->

you know to anybody. Be faithful, and I will see that you
are not punished any further, if it is in my power."</p>

<p>Warren retained his composed attitude till the little girl
had made her courtesy, reached up to the exalted latch of
the door, opened it and disappeared behind it; then he
started up, turned the key upon his desk, and prepared
himself for his walk with all possible expedition. He found
little difficulty in avoiding observation in the dusky twilight, 
and was beyond the creek and half way to the
parson's house before Laura had sent up to call him down
to supper. It was a grey, mild twilight, the weather had
been softening through the day, but not enough to thaw
the frozen ground, or diminish in a great degree the ice
along the creek; shapeless vapory clouds had obscured the
setting of the sun, and now seemed spreading a veil over
the whole heaven; a veil too thin to darken it, but dense
enough to hide the stars, though not to quench their light.
The moon was not due till nearly nine o'clock, so that when
Warren reached the little cabin of the preacher, there was
only a very dim and uncertain light to show him that he
had come on an unavailing errand.</p>

<p>All was still about the house, and the padlock on
the door was firmly locked. He knocked loudly, and
asked admittance in a voice distinct enough to assure
any one within that it was he who spoke. But no movement 
or response showed that he spoke to anything more
intelligent than logs and boards, and with a heartfelt sigh
he slowly turned away. He went home by a different route,
hoping faintly he might encounter Pertinax, or in some way
obtain a clue to Nattee's whereabouts. Of course, the hope

<!-- page 422 -->

proved a vain one, and he had no heart, as he neared the
house, to enter it just then and bear a meeting with his
uncle, and the angry and dangerous consequences that
might result from it.</p>

<p>To the Chapel! A few hours there before midnight
would quiet him, and give things at home time to quiet,
too. There was nothing for him to do, he thought with a
sigh, as he took his way toward it: he was deeply disappointed, 
but not quite disheartened&mdash;he never should give
up hope for her till he had lost confidence in her sincerity,
and that, notwithstanding the blackness of the case, he had
not yet done. She was weak, she was cowardly, ignorant,
but she was not untrue. The power which an enthusiast
like Pertinax might gain over such a mind as hers, he easily
saw, might be unbounded; and that to him she owed the
idea of flight, and the means of protection and sustenance
during her concealment, he had no doubt. To surrender
herself to her master, he was sure, had last night been her
honest, though fearful resolution, when she left him, and
she had needed all his encouragement and assurance to
keep her up to it; but when she was thrown, against her
will, apparently, into the way of her former adviser and protector, 
and was subject to his contradictory influence, it was
natural she should be again unsettled, and that her fears
should at last overcome her resolution.</p>

<p>"If I had only gone with her myself!" he thought, with
a groan.</p>

<p>That he did not go, was the step upon which all the succeeding 
trouble hinged, but he need not have held himself
accountable for it. Its failure to benefit her was all of a

<!-- page 423 -->

piece with the rest of poor Nattee's fate, that seemed to
turn into misfortunes the good intentions and good efforts
of those who wished her well. Her mistress' injudicious
tenderness and indulgence, Lawrence's kindness and consideration, 
Pertinax's interest and compassion, had all, in
turn, proved mischievous and hurtful to her, and now, it
seemed, Warren's earnest efforts to restore her to her duty
had acted in an equally unexpected manner. But he could
not give her up: though he was perfectly at a loss where
to turn to do her any good, he yet felt as if some way
would surely open, and he should see some answer to all
the prayers he had said for her salvation. It was with
a weary sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction that
he shut himself into his little study, remembering the hope
and courage with which he had left it in the morning.</p>

<p>Nattee's fate had passed out of his hands, indeed, but it
was still the care of One to whom it could not be indifferent; 
and "no man may deliver his brother, nor make
agreement unto God for him; for it cost more to redeem
their souls, so he must let that alone forever," but "neither
is God unrighteous that He will forget their works and
labor that proceedeth of love, which love they have showed
for His name's sake."</p>

<p>Prayers that are defeated of their purpose, return with
a doubled blessing to those of whose charity they were
born.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lawrence</span> at last!" said Laura, starting up as she
heard his welcome step upon the flags outside. The clock
was striking nine, and his long-kept supper was waiting on
the table. Laura had been almost crying with disappointment 
and apprehension for the last long hour:</p>

<p>"I thought you were never coming," she whispered, as
he folded her in his arms, lingering a moment in the hall to
murmur a few words that were not in answer to her salutation, 
nor in reference to the subject that engrossed the
attention and anxiety of the family; but only concerned the
one that had power to cover and extinguish and obliterate
all others.</p>

<p>Lawrence had to thank this state of apprehension and
alarm, however, for demonstrations and confessions he
would otherwise have been long in gaining; but the certainty 
of trouble and the possibility of danger had brought

<!-- page 425 -->

her quite out of herself, and she hastened to lavish unreservedly 
upon him the love and tenderness that under other
circumstances he would only have been able to hope for
and imagine. As they came into the light of the doorway,
and she glanced up into his face, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How pale and tired you look! How long have you
been in the saddle?"</p>

<p>"Since six o'clock," he said.</p>

<p>"And what&mdash;what news, Lawrence?" said his mother,
timidly and anxiously, coming forward.</p>

<p>"None, mother, or worse than none," he said, throwing
himself into a chair. "I cannot get the slightest clue to
her, nor can I find that any one else has, except my father.
I had begun to hope that at last she was safe beyond
the river, when, not a mile from here, I met my father,
riding for dear life toward Kiskatom, and with a worse
determination than I have seen since the beginning of this
trouble, and Rube told me just now, that when he was
rubbing down Dirck, after my father last came in, he called
out to him not to water him, for he had been going hard,
and that he had a good many miles before him yet; 'and
they're the last he'll do in this business,' he added, with an
oath. Rube, honest fellow, thinks he means to give up
after trying this once more, but I'm afraid I know him far
too well. He is sure of success, you may depend."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Nattee!" groaned Mrs. Sutherland. "Is
there no hope, Lawrence?"</p>

<p>"None, mother, that I can think of. I should have
turned and followed him, but Bess had lost a shoe, and was
lamed already, and he was going like the wind; you'd have

<!-- page 426 -->

thought Dirck wasn't ten minutes out of the stable. And I
find there isn't a horse that's fresh enough to do a half
hour's work to-night; Bess is entirely spent, and Dick and
Dave have got all the going out of the black nags that can
be coaxed out of them in this twenty-four hours, and the
farm-horses, you know, have had their shoes off these two
weeks. If my father doesn't have to pay for his cursed
ugliness in any other way, he'll find he's damaged horse-flesh 
enough to make it a tolerably dear business."</p>

<p>"If that were all!" sighed Laura.</p>

<p>"Aye, if it were," said Lawrence, passing his hand
across his forehead. "I have had a horrid presentiment ever
since this wretched affair began&mdash;but what's the use of
groaning about presentiments!" he interrupted, glancing
up cheerfully into Laura's face. "What with the things
that do happen and the things that don't happen, we have
our hands full enough without filling them with the things
that we're afraid are going to happen."</p>

<p>Laura tried to return the smile, but there seemed a spell
upon her smiles that night. Perhaps it was the effect of
the day's anxiety, that she was so thoroughly unnerved and
spiritless; Lawrence whispered he should know why she
was pining, if her cheeks kept growing paler at the rate
they had been doing since&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But the flush that his words and glance called up faded
quickly, and he himself had not any heart for jesting. He
looked, indeed, very haggard and worn; and though he
stoutly denied that he suffered any pain from his sprained
shoulder, it was not difficult to see, by the caution of his
movements and the contraction of his face when he was

<!-- page 427 -->

obliged to stir, that it still gave him extreme discomfort,
He made an effort to eat the supper that had been so
carefully kept for him, but it was evidently an effort,
made only to appease the anxiety of the eyes that watched
him.</p>

<p>"There, Steady, take those things away," he cried, pushing 
back his chair. "Your mistress thinks I have had
enough."</p>

<p>When Steady had taken the things away, and left the
room, Laura obeyed Lawrence's gesture, and came beside
him to the fire.</p>

<p>"Most foolish mistress!" he said, laying his hand upon
her shoulder, and looking down in her face. "Spoiling
your lover with pity and tenderness, when you could have
kept him at your feet with half a smile, with half a word!
Don't you know you are ruining him&mdash;making him insatiable, 
tyrannical"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't care what I make him," murmured Laura.</p>

<p>"Unreasonable, selfish, exacting?"</p>

<p>"He is that without my help, already," she would have
said at any other time with a bright smile, but now she
only murmured, yielding to his embrace: "Yes, unreasonable, 
selfish, exacting&mdash;anything&mdash;anything, so he loves me
always!"</p>

<p>"Always," he repeated with a shiver as he held her
close within his arms. "How short our always may be,
after all! Laura, when a man holds that for which he would
have died, within his grasp, that which he has sworn to
win, for which, almost, he would have sold his hopes of
life eternal&mdash;why is it that he shudders and turns faint with

<!-- page 428 -->

fear&mdash;why is it that at the very moment of his bliss, a terror
lest it should be short, a cowardly shrinking dread of death
should enter&mdash;death that he never feared before&mdash;why
should the worm, the clod, the shroud, all images and horrors 
of mortality, creep in to chill him, when life is at the
fullest, at the best?"</p>

<p>Laura did not answer for a moment, then looking at him
wistfully, she said: "The longest happiness here is so short,
is it worth desiring if it goes no further? Oh, Lawrence,
it is no blessing if it is not fit to go on in another life!"</p>

<p>"My darling! it is the only thing in my life that is pure
enough to carry with me to a better&mdash;do not take it from
me&mdash;help me to profit by it&mdash;I hold my better hopes
through this dear one."</p>

<p>"Not through it. Oh, Lawrence, you frighten me&mdash;it is
not right. We cannot have two paradises&mdash;we must not
love God only through His creatures&mdash;He will not accept
it, I am sure."</p>

<p>He released her suddenly, and walked hastily back and
forth across the room. "You cannot understand, you do
not know how it has been with me," he said, as he paused.
"Why may not God lead us to Him even through the
gratification of our own self-will? Why may he not bind
us to Him through indulgence as safely as through subjugation? 
We cannot limit Him."</p>

<p>"No, only as He has limited Himself. Oh, Lawrence,
do not say you are not willing to submit; do not resist
Him till He breaks your will, and saves you by punishment
at last."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and Laura, frightened at her own earnestness, 

<!-- page 429 -->

turned away from his fixed, thoughtful look, and
drew back from beside him, as his mother came into the
room. Lawrence held her hand firmly and drew her down
into a seat at his side, while Mrs. Sutherland sank into a
chair opposite to them. Looking at them and realizing
their happiness was the only comfort she could claim just
then, and her anxious face softened as she watched
them.</p>

<p>"Mother," cried Larry, throwing himself back in his
chair with a half-weary, half-willful look, "Laura has been
preaching to me. I appeal to you, should a woman preach?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutherland smiled doubtfully, and looked remonstrative: 
Lawrence always frightened her with his talking.
But though there was a good deal of the old tone in his
manner now, there was a good deal, too, of one that was
strange and half sad, and it perplexed her simplicity as
much. Lawrence was not wont to let any anxiety or perplexity 
influence him beyond its momentary pressure; it
was strange that he did not throw this off, now that he saw
its hopelessness. And amid his new happiness, it was
doubly strange to see it retain such influence. All the
evening he seemed subdued by fits of thoughtfulness and
abstraction, that were broken occasionally by flashes of the
old spirit, but these grew fewer and fainter as it advanced,
and at length ceased altogether, and the three sat silent,
listening apprehensively, or talking in low, quiet tones that
attempted no disguise. It was impossible to go to bed:
Lawrence once, indeed, said; "It is folly, mother, for you
and Laura to sit up."</p>

<p>But he could not resist Laura's imploring look and his

<!-- page 430 -->

mother's unhappy sigh; "I cannot sleep, Lawrence, till he
comes. Why should I go?"</p>

<p>The clock had struck eleven; Lawrence had walked many
times to the window and looked out, and had again thrown
himself in his chair by the fireside, gazing at Laura as if he
hoped to find self-control and patience in her quiet eyes,
and courage and endurance in the touch of her soft hand:
for a few moments, nothing had been said&mdash;the ticking
of the tall clock in the corner and the crackling of the
fire upon the hearth had been the only sounds that had
repaid their watchfulness&mdash;when suddenly a horse's hoofs
clattering sharply upon the frozen ground, coming rapidly
up the lane and pausing before the barn-door, brought Larry
to his feet, and made his mother hide her eyes and tremble,
while Laura stood motionless, petrified with apprehension.</p>

<p>For several minutes they did not stir, though they heard
nothing at the barn&mdash;then the gate swung open heavily,
and Ralph's well-known step echoed upon the flags. Alone?
They glanced from one to another, listening breathlessly&mdash;yes, 
he was alone. He entered the house, crossed the hall
with a heavy tread, groped along the passage for the door
of his own room, pushed it open and bolted himself in.</p>

<p>Lawrence's face grew dark. What did it mean? There
was neither fire nor light in his father's room; it was his
invariable habit to come first to the sitting-room on entering 
the house, no matter at what hour of night, take
off his boots there, and linger by the fire before he went to
bed; Lawrence never remembered when this rule had
offered an exception; there was something significant of
trouble in this change. He took up the lantern from the

<!-- page 431 -->

sideboard, muttering something about looking after Dirck,
and lit it at the fire.</p>

<p>"My son, you can't do anything&mdash;don't go!" faltered
his mother, following him tremblingly to the door.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do, dear mother," he said with an
attempt to speak reassuredly. "I'm only going to see if
all's right at the stable before I go to bed."</p>

<p>Laura did not wait for or ask permission, but picking up
the cloak he had thrown down as he snatched his fur cap
from the peg, she followed him out noiselessly but closely.
He strode down the path so rapidly he did not see her till
she reached the gate.</p>

<p>"You here, Laura!" he said, as he held it open for her;
but he did not tell her to go back, only took the hand she
slipped in his, and hurried on. He was unconscious of the
grasp in which he held it, but it told a story of preoccupation 
and dread that made Laura's heart sink. She held the
lantern while he undid the bars of the stable-door and
pushed aside the clumsy fastenings. There was not much
need of the lantern while they were outside, at least. The
night was singularly light, though there was neither moon
nor stars in sight. The moon, however, was at its full, and
filled the thin sheet of cloud that was spread over the
whole heaven, not brilliantly nor luminously, but with a
grey, spectral light; the air was soft and mild for that late
season; not a breath of air stirred; all nature, indeed,
seemed strangely still and listening.</p>

<p>When Lawrence had succeeded in withdrawing the bolts,
the heavy double-doors fell open of themselves, and taking
the lantern from Laura's hand without a word, he entered

<!-- page 432 -->

the barn and hurried across to Dirck's stall in the further
corner. The brute's eyes shone like balls of fire, as he
stood with his head stretched across his manger, stamping
heavily upon the ground at intervals, and pulling restlessly
at the halter round his neck. Lawrence glanced in at him
hastily; his head-stall had been taken off, but the saddle
was still on, the girths not even loosened; flakes of foam
lay about his mouth and neck; the manger was empty;
the hard-run horse had neither been rubbed down, fed nor
watered.</p>

<p>"Stand back, Laura; you may hold the lantern up for
me, if you will. The men are worn out and are fast asleep.
I must groom the brute myself."</p>

<p>He vaulted over into the stall, unfastened the halter and
led him around through a side door upon the barn floor
itself. Laura shrunk back timidly as the towering beast,
letting his great hoofs down heavily on the resounding
floor, approached her at a measured pace.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?" said Lawrence, reaching up to a beam
overhead for the curry-comb and pail. "Set the lantern
down if you are. I can see so, very well."</p>

<p>"No," said Laura, faintly, "I'd rather hold it."</p>

<p>She came a little closer, and held the lantern up; Larry
stooped down to loosen the saddle; the girths had been
overstrained, and the buckle would not give; he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"A little closer, Laura; I can't see," and Laura crept a
little nearer, and held down the light to where it shone
directly over his shoulder, and full on the muscular and
heaving haunches of the horse. Lawrence gave a violent
start, let go the saddle-band, and striking him suddenly

<!-- page 433 -->

above the fetlock, seized the hoof he raised, and examined
it hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Closer, closer, Laura," he said, huskily, and Laura,
kneeling down, held the lantern close against the hoof.</p>

<p>A cold chill ran through her as she saw what made him
drop it, pass his hand hastily over the wet fetlock and the
spattered flank, and stagger back with such a fearful groan.
There was blood, half dried, upon his heavy, sharp shod
hoof, blood dripping from his shaggy fetlock, blood staining 
his white flanks&mdash;a rope knotted in the crupper hung
dangling down upon the ground.</p>

<p>Lawrence raised it for an instant&mdash;a fragment of a dark
blue linsey-woolsey dress was drooping from it.</p>

<p>"I knew it! Oh, it is too horrible!" he muttered between 
his tight set teeth.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;tell me," whispered Laura, clinging in terror
to him.</p>

<p>"He has found her&mdash;somewhere away from any help&mdash;lashed 
her to this rope to lead her home&mdash;the horse has
taken fright&mdash;she is dashed to death upon the rocks"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>For several minutes no word was spoken: Lawrence
stood leaning against the manger, supporting himself with
one hand, with the other mechanically grasping Dirck's
halter, his face bloodless and rigid, and his eyes fixed on
the ground, while Laura's head was between her hands and
bowed down on his arm.</p>

<p>At last he started, saying hoarsely:</p>

<p>"I must know the worst. Go in, Laura, but do not tell
my mother till there is a certainty. I shall soon be back."</p>

<p>"Oh don't, don't go, Lawrence!" cried Laura, clinging

<!-- page 434 -->

to his arm, "you will not mount that dreadful brute&mdash;you
will not be so cruel to me!"</p>

<p>He hardly seemed to hear her, as he strode out of the
barn, leading the reluctant horse, who struggled fiercely as
they reached the doorway, planting both feet firmly on the
floor, and throwing back his head.</p>

<p>"You will not trust yourself to him?" exclaimed Laura,
shrinking back in terror. "Remember how weak your
arm is yet&mdash;wait for another horse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no other, my darling, fit to go. Do not be
frightened&mdash;I am strong enough for Dirck. One kiss, and
let me go."</p>

<p>They were outside the barn now, and the horse stood
passive for a moment, as he held Laura in his arms and
pressed a kiss upon her lips. Even after his foot was in
the stirrup, he turned and passed his arm around her once
again, whispering some loving reassurance. Dirck, impatient 
of the tenderness, stamped restlessly and pulled
strongly at the bridle over Larry's aim, who, after an
instant, vaulted into the saddle and gathered up the reins.</p>

<p>"Come down and open the gate for me," he said.</p>

<p>Laura walked silently beside him down the road to the
great gate that led into the lane. He reined up Dirck as
he passed through it, and bending down from the saddle,
whispered, as he left another kiss upon her forehead,</p>

<p>"Go in and comfort mother, Laura, and do not think of
me. God knows"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The broken sentence died upon his lips; he started up,
and Dirck, with a quick bound, dashed from under the
loosened rein. Laura stood gazing after the horse and

<!-- page 435 -->

rider till they were lost in a winding of the lane; then
turned back toward the house, with a blank, cold sense of
vacancy and desolation. The night was so still and grey,
the light was so strange and spectral, she longed to shelter
herself from it in the house; but when she reached it, the
house had gloom and dreariness as great. Her aunt met her
at the door, pale and trembling, hardly daring to ask what
she had learned, and what had taken Lawrence away so
suddenly.</p>

<p>"He is afraid something has happened; he's gone to see
if he can learn anything," she said, pressing her hand over
her heart, and trying to speak quietly.</p>

<p>"But, Laura&mdash;but, my child," murmured Mrs. Sutherland, 
with a wild look of alarm, "what does he think has
happened? what is he afraid of?"</p>

<p>"He cannot tell, dear mother," Laura said, putting her
arms around her. "He said you must not be alarmed, he
would soon be back. You know it was not strange he
should want to go and ascertain himself, if possible."</p>

<p>Laura's white face belied her reassuring words; all life
and strength seemed to have gone out of her limbs, and
she caught hold of the nearest chair to keep herself from
falling.</p>

<p>"I've walked so fast up from the gate, I am a little
faint," she faltered as she met her companion's frightened
eyes. "I want to unfasten this, it is so heavy."</p>

<p>But it was not the cloak that oppressed her, though she
breathed freer as it fell back. Poor Laura! The words
"Go in and comfort mother," were ringing in her ears,
but her heart seemed a stone within her, soul and body

<!-- page 436 -->

both had fainted under the heavy pressure that had fallen on
them&mdash;how could she rouse them up to keep her promise&mdash;to 
fulfill her lover's parting charge?</p>

<p>Love is a stirring stimulant, a powerful master over
souls and bodies both; in five minutes Laura was quiet,
controlled, and thoughtful, watching tenderly over her
confused and agitated companion, soothing her distress, reasoning 
away her fears.</p>

<p>"Dear aunt," she said, taking the poor lady's hand, as
she seated herself on a low stool at her feet, "dear aunt, do
not give way to such alarm&mdash;think how it would distress
Larry. He will so soon be back we can afford to be composed 
at least till we hear whether he has bad news or no."</p>

<p>But it was a dearly bought composure; every minute
seemed to Laura like an age of suffering; her words of
comfort sounded in her own ears like a horrible hypocrisy,
listening, as she was at the same time, for what her heart
told her would belie them. She did not dare to stir away
from her aunt's side, nor relinquish for a moment the
fluttering hand she held, though a wild impatience throbbed
in every nerve, and a restless fire seemed burning against
her brain. It would have been such immeasurable relief to
have walked the floor, to have started to the window at
the distantest indication of a sound, to have pressed her
hands against her temples to still their dreadful aching; it
might not have done away with her distress, but at least
it would not have chained it up so tightly, and made it
press itself so frantically against every vein and nerve.
Actual bodily pain resulted from the control she put upon
herself; every limb ached as acutely as if she had been

<!-- page 437 -->

chained to that one spot by tangible and real fetters.
Sometimes it seemed to her she could not bear the constraint 
another instant, and she found herself going on,
speaking quietly, looking calmly, under her aunt's fixed,
wistful eyes; every minute of her own endurance was a
fresh surprise to her, but every minute was more racking
than the last.</p>

<p>"Hark!" whispered Mrs. Sutherland, at last, in a tone
that made Laura shiver: but Laura had heard, long before
she spoke&mdash;long, that is, as those dire seconds counted.</p>

<p>Far off down the road, miles away, it seemed to her, she
had heard the rapid running gallop of a horse: nearer and
nearer, now softer over the turfy roadside, now louder on
the frozen ground, now clattering across the rocks&mdash;nearer
and nearer, but the women never stirred; grasping each
other's hands, and staring blankly in each other's pallid
faces, they sat as if spell-bound by the sound.</p>

<p>Even when it grew so near they could count every stroke
of the rapid hoofs upon the ground, they did not breathe or
turn or change a feature. The flying steed rushed homeward 
at a fearful pace&mdash;the whole still night seemed resounding 
with the thunder of his hoofs, as he came tearing
down the lane, through the open gateway, along the flags,
up&mdash;up to the very door. Why did not Laura fly to meet
her lover? Why did not the mother hurry to her son's
embrace? The one crouched speechless at the other's feet,
locked in a close embrace of terror.</p>

<p>There was no sound without for the space of a whole
minute, save the restless trampling of the heavy-limbed
beast before the door. Laura lifted her head, and rose

<!-- page 438 -->

shuddering from her knees, releasing herself slowly from
the vice-like grasp of her companion's hands, then crept
fearfully toward the door, and out into the black, still hall.
She groped her way bewildered through it; her hand struck
on the great iron bolt that secured the entrance, half unconsciously 
she mastered it, turned the key with both trembling
hands, and pulled it open.</p>

<p>There, ghost-like in the grey light, half a rod from her,
stood the riderless steed. Her eye fell on the empty saddle&mdash;she 
made one step forward and stretched out her hands,
then clasped them to her forehead and shrunk back. There
was a heavy fall beside her, and a low groan; she started,
and bent down and whispered, "Mother!"</p>

<p>She raised the poor stricken head upon her knee, and
chafed the lifeless hands, and called upon her beseechingly
to look up at her and to speak. But when at last she did
look up, and lifted her slow eyes, the light of reason had
set in them forever: the last scorching bolt had driven
everything before it&mdash;memory, anticipation, pain&mdash;and had
left only vacancy and oblivion in her desolated mind.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

<p class="small">FIVE YEARS AFTER.</p>

When we no more can smile;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in the afternoon of a fine June day; the
setting sun was shining down the walks of a large, well
ordered garden in the suburbs of New York; early flowers
were open in the beds; the hedge was sweet with lilacs, and
ceringos, and honeysuckles, and over the summer-house,
that stood half way between the mansion and the river, a
June rose climbed luxuriantly, and was just blushing into
bloom.</p>

<p>The garden, however, presented anything but a picture
of still life at that moment. Five children, three of the sex
that bullies and throws stones, and two of the one that
pouts and pulls hair, tore up and down the paths, and in
and out of the summer-house, yelling, and whooping, and
laughing, and fighting, as only childhood can. If anything
else could, this planet would be an undesirable residence.
Providentially, the young of the human species wear out

<!-- page 440 -->

their spirits and their enthusiasm inside of the first score
of their allotted three, and give their elders a chance to get
to their graves in peace. Fancy untold millions of people
romping, and tearing, and hallooing through life in school-boy 
earnest; the earth would be complained of as a nuisance
in the planetary system.</p>

<p>The two ladies who sat in the summer-house groaned as
the five emancipated young savages burst out from the
house and spread themselves over the garden. The younger
and prettier of the two threw down the volume of "Evelina" 
she held, exclaiming, "There's an end to reading
aloud!" while her companion gave a discontented glance
toward them, and said, "If their father only had a little
authority over them!"</p>

<p>The young lady's face, and the slight shrug she gave,
seemed to indicate that she thought mothers were not
entirely devoid of responsibility in the matter of authority,
but she did not say anything.</p>

<p>The matron, meanwhile, laid down her work and turned
toward the intruders with a feeble remonstrance, which was
met by a mauling embrace from the two girls, who wanted
permission to do something unheard of, and by a wild
Indian yell from the three boys, who were already in a
rough-and-tumble fight.</p>

<p>"Give us the key of the boat-house, mamma&mdash;give us the
key," coaxed Christy, hanging around the wretched lady's
neck.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma&mdash;yes, you must," cried the younger girl,
thumping heavily on her knee to insure her entire attention.</p>

<!-- page 441 -->

<p>"No, don't you, mamma," shouted Rowly, picking himself 
up out of the dust. "Don't you let 'em go. I won't
have 'em. I'm going to row myself. I won't have any
girls along, I won't."</p>

<p>"Mamma, shan't he?" shrieked the girls in concert,
while Rowly, turning a somersault out into the path,
vowed he'd break the boat-house open if he couldn't get the
key, and started off to put his threat in execution, with the
two younger boys close at his heels, whereupon the two
girls gave chase, rending the air with their shrill shrieks,
and tearing pell-mell, helter-skelter, head-over-heels down
the path. About half way to the river, however, Rowly's
foot slipped, and he fell sprawling over a promising bed of
hyacinths and tulips, and his pursuers, too close and too
violent to arrest themselves in time, stumbled over the
prostrate hero, and fell promiscuously, involved in a common 
ruin. Mrs. Templeton, at the dire sight, hid her eyes
and groaned, but sat still, while Miss Birket, the pretty
niece, exclaimed it served them right, and she hoped sincerely 
they were hurt.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, there emerged from the house
a tall, pale girl, with a very wearied look and a listless step,
holding in her hand a book and garden hat, and drinking
in a thirsty breath of the fresh air, as if it were the first she
had had all day.</p>

<p>"There!" cried the young lady, in a tone of relief, as she
caught sight of the new comer. "Do let her take them off
for a walk or something. She's the only one that can keep
them quiet."</p>

<p>The approach of the governess seemed to remove a great

<!-- page 442 -->

weight from the mother's mind. She looked up very much
relieved, and said peevishly, as she came toward them:</p>

<p>"Do see what is the matter with those children, I beg.
You may take them down to the water for an hour before
tea-time, if you can keep them within sight of you. Don't
let Rowly get into the boat-house, though, on any account,
and be sure you bring them in before dark."</p>

<p>The governess paused a moment before the door of the
summer-house, and opened her lips as if to speak, then
turned her head away, and moved quietly down the path.
Her approach seemed to have a composing effect upon the
struggling heap of little humans: she picked up one, brushed
the dust from the apron of another, and spoke with quiet
authority to a third. All clamored their defences and complaints, 
and clustered about her skirts with incoherent
declarations and accusations, but it was very evident they
acknowledged her supremacy, and yielded her the best
obedience they were able.</p>

<p>In the calm that succeeded their retreat. Miss Birket
said, thoughtfully, looking after them:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Aunt Rache, I should not wonder if you
had trouble with that young woman sometime. I think
she has a temper."</p>

<p>A disinterested observer might have suggested Miss
Birket had a right to know temper when she saw it, if anybody 
had. She was very fair and feminine looking, rather
undersized, and by no means unattractive; but there was
more willfulness than merriment hid under her pretty
dimples, and a very domineering spirit shone at times from
her blue eyes. In a word, if she had been a shade less

<!-- page 443 -->

pretty, she would have been detestable; but her youth, her
fairness, her piquancy, saved her from termagancy, and
rendered palatable her <i>prononc&eacute;e</i> manners, her dashing
freedom, and her startling willfulness. Few women liked
her, and the ascendency she had gained over her aunt was
owing more to the superiority of her mind than to the
amiability of her household manners. Mrs. Templeton had
assumed the charge of the young orphan rather unwillingly,
but the idea of a companion in her exile from England, and
one who was young and pretty, and beau-mondeish, reconciled 
her to the demands of sisterly affection, and the
spoiled Fanny had to accept the favor of her protection,
and affect gratitude for it, when she was inwardly rebelling
against the fate it consigned her to. The best years of
her life, that is, of her beauty, wasted in colonial society&mdash;the 
very prime and hey-day of her youth spent in the
suburbs of a dull town like this! Her whole soul revolted, 
and a growing discontent sharpened every tone,
and hurried every movement.</p>

<p>To be sure, the best society the place afforded met at
Colonel Templeton's house, and in those anti-republican
days, the society of New York considered itself very good
indeed. The most intelligent men of the new country, and
the favored emissaries from the old, breathed together the
invigorating air of the new metropolis, and met on common
ground&mdash;the one refined and polished by contact with conventionalities, 
the other enlarged and elevated by communion 
with free mind. Colonel Templeton, though by no
means a shining light in this sphere, was sufficiently well-placed 
and well-informed to keep a tolerable position in it.

<!-- page 444 -->

He had received the order to sail for America with rather a
bad grace, being a quiet third-rate man, and hating great
changes with all the heart he had. He had had the misfortune 
to marry an heiress, who was at once ugly and of good
family. It was a fearful combination of circumstances; if
she had been only rich, he could have equalized matters by
talking up his family; or if she had been simply well-born,
he could have weighed his purse against her claims, and
made her feel its material advantage; but being before him
in both these points, and being just acute enough to know
it, the lady allowed no occasion to pass unimproved, but
taunted him unceasingly with them. She had not force
nor intelligence enough to make her attacks very telling;
she only kept up a sort of guerrilla warfare that was
exceedingly exasperating and wearing, but which could
have been put down almost immediately by a prompt and
decided hand. The unfortunate Colonel, however, did not
wield a prompt and decided hand; he had some pomposity
of manner and a slowness of speech that imposed upon the
multitude, but not upon his family: from Christy up, they
all knew they could ride over him without the slightest
difficulty, if they made up their minds to do it.</p>

<p>Miss Birket was not slow to find out what a narrow mind
her aunt had, and what a fumbling uncertain will her
uncle's was, and that she might rule the household if she
chose, and she <i>did</i> choose, it may be well imagined. The
children she did not attempt often to coerce, but merely
used her influence to banish them as much as possible from
the company of their elders, and to keep them out of her
way entirely. From the governess she had anticipated

<!-- page 445 -->

trouble; but, strange to say, the poor young woman had
not yet revolted from the abominable tyranny that tied her,
for fourteen hours of the twenty-four, to those wild colts;
she had no moment of daylight to herself&mdash;a more wearing
life of bondage it would be difficult to imagine; but she
seemed sworn to submission, chained voluntarily to endurance. 
Miss Birket saw at a glance the governess was quite
her match in will and spirit, and though the governess
chose to put them both to school, and curb them into mute
subjection, she never felt entirely safe.</p>

<p>"I advise you to keep your eye on her, Aunt Rache,"
she reiterated, musingly, as she watched the commanding
figure of the young woman moving slowly down the path.
"I wouldn't trust her too far. There is something about
her eyes I do not like. She is deep&mdash;I am sure she is. My
uncle is rather soft about her, she's so good-looking, and
would have you let her come into the drawing-room, and
make us treat her like one of the family; but if you take
my advice, you won't allow anything of the kind. If she
once got a foothold, you would never be able to get her
back. She is very determined, I am sure, and would soon
be utterly unbearable."</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton, who was very jealous of her husband, as
Fanny well knew, started a little at the allusion to Colonel
Templeton's soft-heartedness about the governess' good
looks, and said sharply, she did not believe Colonel Templeton 
remembered there was such a person in the house,
except at breakfast-time, and hardly then, after he had
helped her to omelette, and sent her a chop.</p>

<p>"Dear aunt!" cried Fanny, laughing, "I don't mean to

<!-- page 446 -->

say he's in love with the creature, only he notices her and
thinks she's handsome, and feels as if we women were a
little hard on her. Don't you remember how unusually
animated he was when we were talking of going down to
the seaside last week for a couple of days without her?
And how he ordered you, absolutely ordered you, to ask
her to come downstairs, on the birthday night? And she
knows who to go to very well when she wants any favor.
I must confess it provoked me a little, at Christmas, to see
her walk straight past you in the hall and go into my uncle's
study to ask him for two extra days for the children. As
if the lady of the house were not the proper one to regulate
those things! But she knew where to look for indulgence!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Templeton grew as black as a thunder-cloud, and
twitched at her work nervously, while Fanny, with great
unconcern and sweetness, picked up her book and turned
over the leaves to find her place.</p>

<p>"You are very much mistaken, if you think your uncle is
indulgent to&mdash;to such persons from anything but absent-mindedness 
and indifference," she said, tartly, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I know that!" answered Fanny, pleased
to see her shaft had taken such effect, and willing to smooth
it over as much as she could, without drawing it out. "Of
course; but then, you know, it is vexing to think she may
presume upon it, and get his sympathy, and all that. Gentlemen 
are flattered by being appealed to, you see, and my
uncle is so kind-hearted. All I want to urge upon you is,
to keep her in her proper place&mdash;the school-room. And
that absurd idea of my uncle's, of having the older children

<!-- page 447 -->

come to the breakfast-table&mdash;it has always provoked me.
Of course, it involves having her, too; but if they took all
their meals upstairs, it would be perfectly natural she should
stay with them. At home, you never would have dreamed
of having a troop of children and a governess in the dining-room 
at breakfast, any more than you would have had them
there at dinner; it's only being in this outlandish place that
makes things so out of joint."</p>

<p>"I have been resolved upon that change for a month
past," said Mrs. Templeton, with energy. "It annoys me
exceedingly to have the racket of the children at breakfast,
and I mean they shall take all their meals upstairs, particularly 
when we have company. If that young Mr. Sutherland 
had come yesterday, as we somewhat expected, I
should have had their breakfast served by themselves this
morning."</p>

<p>"Do you think it possible for him to come to-day?"
Fanny asked, well satisfied with the result of her diplomacy
thus far.</p>

<p>"Very possible," her aunt said, looking at her watch. "I
should not be surprised if he arrived before tea-time."</p>

<p>"Then I had better go and dress," Fanny said, glancing
down at her frock. "I forgot the young Cr&oelig;sus when I
put on this muslin."</p>

<p>"I do not believe you need take much trouble," Mrs.
Templeton said, ill-humoredly, being quite out of temper
with everybody. "I don't believe he's such a Cr&oelig;sus as
they say, or he would not stay in this country. He'd go
home to England and live like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"He's Quixotic, my uncle says, which is very bad, I

<!-- page 448 -->

grant; but one might cure him of that, you know. And he
must be rich, or people would never treat him with so much
respect, and talk so much about him. And my uncle says
his estate at home is one of the finest he ever saw, and is
steadily increasing in value; and he ought to know, I'm
sure, being one of the executors. Oh, I'm not afraid he
isn't rich&mdash;I'm only afraid he is a horror, and can't be
swallowed, even through a golden tube."</p>

<p>At this moment a servant approached from the house
with a card. Fanny met him at the summer-house door,
and reading it hastily, cried:</p>

<p>"He's here, Aunt Rache; do you go into the drawing-room&mdash;you 
look plenty well&mdash;and I'll hurry up and
dress."</p>

<p>"But I don't look well enough," remonstrated the aunt,
looking at her rumpled dress and mauled cap-strings. "The
children have torn me all to pieces."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Fanny, straightening her cap, and
smoothing down her hair. "Nonsense! you look perfectly
well&mdash;as nice as possible. Do go directly in."</p>

<p>And almost pushing her toward the house, she succeeded
in having her own way&mdash;making a victim of her relative,
and gaining plenty of time for her own toilette.</p>

<p>It was almost twilight when the governess returned from
the river-side with her restless charge. She held two of
them firmly by the hand, as she entered the hall, but the
surplus, for whom she had no hand, rushed wildly before
her, whooping and yelling, without the least regard to the
threatening gestures of the servant, who impressively whispered 
there was company within.</p>

<!-- page 449 -->

<p>"Company!" shouted Rowly, "who cares for company!
Let's go see what kind of company it is."</p>

<p>Very torn and muddy and blowsy, looking much more
like a coalheaver's boy than an English gentleman's son,
Master Rowly bolted into the parlor, followed at a little
distance by his younger brother Harry, with his hat over
his eyes, and his hands in his pockets. Mrs. Templeton half
rose, with an agonized gesture; Colonel Templeton sat still,
as if too much stunned to speak, while Miss Fanny, sitting
by the "company," in the window seat, was the first to
break the silence with a ringing, merry laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, Rowly! you are a beauty, no one can deny."</p>

<p>"No," cried Rowly with spirit, advancing nearer, "it's
you that's a beauty&mdash;ain't she now?" he continued, entirely
unabashed, looking at the visitor.</p>

<p>The young gentleman laughed and blushed a very little,
and Fanny laughed and blushed a good deal. The young
gentleman said his young friend had taste and judgment
beyond his years, and his young friend felt from that moment 
that they were one in soul, and immediately appropriated 
the vacant seat at his side and began to play with
his watch-chain. No remonstrances could induce him to
budge.</p>

<p>"You don't want me to go, do you?" he demanded,
looking up with the clearest, truest blue eye into the gentleman's 
face.</p>

<p>"No," said the gentleman very decidedly and honestly,
feeling, perhaps, that that eye was the most reliable thing
he had looked into since he entered the house.</p>

<p>"There, you hear, now," he exclaimed, looking triumphantly 

<!-- page 450 -->

around upon the family; "and I'm going to take tea
downstairs with him. You needn't shake your head at
me, Fanny Birket; I'm going to stay."</p>

<p>"Mamma'll let you, I know she will&mdash;just this once,"
said Fanny, with artless sweetness. "Please let him take
tea downstairs to-night."</p>

<p>"Well," said his mother, miserably, "yes, perhaps, if
he'll go up and be washed immediately."</p>

<p>"No," replied the boy stoutly, "that's just what I won't
do. I know I won't be let down again. Don't I remember 
the dinner party! how Fanny coaxed I might be left
while the people were by, and then sent Margaret up to
lock me into the nursery while I was washing myself?"</p>

<p>"Why, Rowly!" exclaimed Fanny, with well-feigned
perplexity, "what <i>are</i> you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know what I'm talking about," he cried, putting 
down his head and looking very ugly at her; "and
you ar'n't going to get me off again."</p>

<p>"My son," said Col. Templeton with feeble pomp, "my
son, you are troublesome. Get down from Mr. Sutherland's
lap, and try to be a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Well, I am a trying," said the boy, getting down; "but
I won't go upstairs."</p>

<p>As no one but the governess had ever made any progress
in subjugating Rowly, stratagem was always resorted to
when it became necessary to manage him, and in consequence 
he had grown very sharp, and was always on the
lookout for it. Harry was comparatively an easy subject,
always bellowing like a young bull calf at any measures of
opposition, but generally giving in to them at last, without

<!-- page 451 -->

vigorous resistance. So, at this time, when his father
ordered him away, and his mother fretfully seconded the
edict, he howled and kicked awhile, but at last submitted to
be led away by John, and comparative peace was restored.
Rowly had a pacific and honorable tea, holding fast to Mr.
Sutherland's hand when Fanny waved him to the lower end
of the table. Now it was an invariable custom of Rowly's
to answer any such dumb show out in very plain language,
and Fanny ought to have known better. He scowled at
her again, and said with great distinctness:</p>

<p>"No; I won't go down there. You can sit that side of
him, if you want to, but I'm a-going to sit here."</p>

<p>Pretty Fanny Birket! How she could have ground her
teeth if it wouldn't have interfered with her dimples! How
her slim fingers ached to be about the boy's ears, and how
the boy's ears would have caught it if she could have got
him by himself! But Rowly didn't mean she should get him
by himself, he was a great deal too wise for that; so, shortly
after the evening meal was completed and they had
returned to the drawing-room, he anticipated his father's
invitation, and announced his intention of going to bed.</p>

<p>"That's right, Rowly," said his father, very much relieved.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I meant it to be," he returned, going
up to kiss his mother. He bestowed the same compliment
upon his father, and then walked over to his new friend,
and holding up his face to his, said, "I'm going to kiss you
good-night before I go."</p>

<p>Mr. Sutherland kissed him very seriously, quite principled 
against encouraging him in his brusqueness, but enjoying 

<!-- page 452 -->

it very much, nevertheless. Fanny held out her hand
as he passed her, but he walked out of the way of it, and
said determinedly, "No, I don't want to." He saw she
bit her lip as he looked back at her from the door, and it
afforded him so much innocent gratification that he turned a
somersault across the hall, and rushed up the stairs like an
advance of cavalry, and burst into the school-room with an
Indian war-whoop.</p>

<p>"You hateful, noisy boy!" cried Christy, spitefully, slapping 
at him as he sprang into the circle round the governess'
knee.</p>

<p>"I'll knock you down if you don't keep off," growled
Harry, who had been bursting with envy ever since he had
been upstairs.</p>

<p>"Make the boys stop fighting," fretted little Hetty, with
an odious whine, "and go on with the story, or I'll cry,"</p>

<p>The school-room was a great blank apartment, with five
desks and a black-board at one end, and some chairs and a
table at the other. The governess sat by the west window,
which was open, and the children sat around her feet, Hetty
leaning on her lap, and the others pressing as near to her as
she would allow. Rowly made an attempt to insinuate
himself into the circle, but was driven back amid a storm
of protestations. For some reason, she of the ferule did
not seem disposed to exert her authority to restore order,
but leaned her head back wearily against the window, and
looked thoughtfully out.</p>

<p>"Shall Rowly have my stool?"</p>

<p>"Mayn't he keep off?"</p>

<p>"Ought he to hear my story?"</p>

<!-- page 453 -->

<p>"Won't you speak to him?"</p>

<p>"Look how he's kicking me!" rose in wild clamor round
her, before she turned her eyes toward them, or seemed to
understand their accusations.</p>

<p>"Well," cried Rowly, springing on the table and thumping 
a tattoo upon it with a couple of books, "if I can't hear
the story, you shan't either!"</p>

<p>The hubbub that arose on this was deafening; the young
lady exclaimed, "Don't, children, you torture me!" in a
manner very different from her ordinary firm command;
"Rowly, I did not expect this from you. It is not kind."</p>

<p>"Well, now, look here," said the boy, very penitent, getting 
down from the table, "what's the use of saying so to
me? You know I didn't mean it."</p>

<p>Her unusual tone had quite melted him; she had not
worn out entreaty by frequent use, so it availed her when
she took it up from necessity. He said, "Hold your tongues,
children," and stamped about in great earnest to get them
quiet.</p>

<p>"They will not be that till you set them the example,"
she said, leaning her head down on her hands upon the
table.</p>

<p>"I don't know how," said Rowly, dismally and candidly.
In truth, there was nothing he knew less about. But his
dismay at the sight of his best friend's attitude of dejection
inspired him with something like good manners; he controlled 
his desire to kick Harry for his insubordination, and
throttle Christy for her continued racket, and called out in
conciliatory tones:</p>

<p>"Come, now, if you'll hush, I won't fight you any more.

<!-- page 454 -->

You let her alone, Christy, and don't make her head ache
any worse; or I'll tell papa about you. Hetty, let go her
frock; here, take hold of my hand. Now, if you'll all come
and sit down and be quiet, I'll tell you about the company."</p>

<p>"Who cares for your company? <i>I</i> saw him," muttered
Harry.</p>

<p>"Tell me," cried Christy, with very sharp feminine curiosity, 
"what's his name, and how long is he going to stay?
Is he nice, and does Fanny like him?"</p>

<p>"Fanny like him? Why, of course she does. Everybody 
likes him, and he's nicer than Major Titherly, or any
of the gentlemen that come to see Fanny. He let me sit
by him all the time; and I shouldn't wonder if I made him
a present of my map of India before he went away."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Harry, for he did not in the least
believe it. Rowly's map of India, for which he had
received a prize at Christmas, and no end of praise, was the
very apple of his eye.</p>

<p>"You be quiet, will you?" he said sternly to Harry over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"But what does he look like?" questioned Christy, perseveringly. 
"Is he handsome and tall?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about his being tall, I didn't think anything 
about it, I'll look next time I see him. And he isn't
handsome, like other people&mdash;he hasn't got any beard at
all; he doesn't look like a boy, for all that&mdash;he looks as if
he knew a great deal more than papa."</p>

<p>"I don't see why Fanny should like him so, if he isn't
handsome, though," Christy said, thoughtfully.</p>

<!-- page 455 -->

<p>"Did I say he wasn't handsome?" retorted Rowly,
sharply. "Isn't she a little fool&mdash;just hear her," he continued, 
appealing to the governess, who had risen, and was
standing by the window, leaning her face against the pane
and looking out. "Didn't I say he was handsome, but not
like other people? I'll tell you what he looks like&mdash;he
looks like that picture of St. John you made me for my
prayer-book&mdash;he looks just like it&mdash;I wish he was related to
me!" he added, with energy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Christy, "perhaps he will be one of these
days. Perhaps he'll marry Fanny."</p>

<p>"He shan't!" Rowly snapped at first, then seemed to
think better of it. "He'd be my first cousin if he did,
wouldn't he? And live here perhaps. Well, I don't know
whether I'd mind. And he likes Fanny, I know. He talks
to her more'n to anybody else, and she's so monstrous
sweet to him! Ah!" he cried, deprecatingly, as the
young lady turned round sharply, and touched the little
bell upon the table. "Why need we have prayers yet?
We ar'n't sleepy, one of us, and I've got so much to
tell 'em!"</p>

<p>"It is past the hour already," she said, and there was no
further remonstrance, for they had learned to respect that
bell, if nothing else on earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children's breakfast was served upstairs the morning
following, and so it was the next day, and the next; the
line of demarcation was drawn stronger than ever between
seniors and juniors, no one but Rowly daring ever to break
through it, and even he would not have been allowed to
succeed in his attempts, if it had not happened that he had
the favor and encouragement of the visitor, who had
evidently taken a fancy to the rough little rebel, and liked
to have him by him. And as Mr. Sutherland was a guest
to be deferred to, Mr. Sutherland had but to say the word,
and Rowly's sentence was remitted, and he was allowed to
bask in the smiles of the drawing-room. Fanny bore it
with a very sweet grace, as she always bore inevitable
things before people. She anathematized him in her heart,
but spared no pains to conciliate and win him. It was a
very necessary step, for Rowly had such an unpleasant way
of saying out whatever he thought, it was highly desirable
his thoughts should be complimentary ones. Children are
considered proof against insincere cajoling; but in this

<!-- page 457 -->

case, Rowly's honest instincts seemed temporarily hoodwinked: 
he showed himself, alas! not incorruptible; he
was young, but he had his price, if paid down punctually,
in burnt almonds and lollipop. He began to assume <i>grand-seigneur</i> 
manners in the school-room, and to resist, a little
ostentatiously, the authority of his teacher; he was too big
to have to mind like Christy and Jack&mdash;Fanny said he was;
Fanny said he shouldn't have to stay much longer with the
girls; she promised she would coax mamma to send him
away to boarding-school, and then wouldn't he make 'em all
stand round when he came back at holidays!</p>

<p>The poor governess felt as if all the world had turned
against her, now Rowly had gone over to the enemy.
There was more in him that was tolerable than in any of
the others; Christy was frivolous and Harry was sulky,
Hetty was peevish and Jack was commonplace, and all
were a little underhand and skulking, owing to the miscellaneous 
and uncertain training they had had before they
had fallen into her hands. All but Rowly, who was truth
and stubbornness itself. No one had ever guessed he had
an affectionate heart, till his governess guessed at it, and
was repaid for her large faith by a most loyal devotion and
a very robust championship. How much this had touched
her, and how dear the young Troublesome had been to her,
she did not realize, till she began to see there was danger
he would be alienated from her.</p>

<p>"My last friend!" she thought, with a half bitter, half
sad smile, as Fanny had put her head in at the door, and
told him to go dress himself he was to go with her and Mr.
Sutherland to drive, and Rowly, with a shout, had slammed

<!-- page 458 -->

down his desk and dashed after her, without asking leave or
license of his preceptress. "My last friend; but it is all
right&mdash;I should have known better."</p>

<p>How long the days seemed to the governess about those
times, and how dull! The music from the drawing-room,
the distant sounds of laughing and talking, only made the
school-room dismaller and wearier. There had been less
difficulty than was anticipated in suppressing the governess;
Fanny began to think she might have saved herself the
trouble, she would have suppressed herself. A morbid
dread of meeting strangers seemed to haunt her, and the
house was full of strangers now. Not one of them, probably, 
however, had ever caught a glimpse of her, or heard
her name or thought of her existence there; she need
not have shrunk within her prison so fearfully; they all
seemed busy with themselves, and selfishness is marvellously
blind.</p>

<p>It was on one soft evening, however, just about a week
after the arrival of Mr. Sutherland and the guests who had
followed him, that, seduced by the quiet of the house into a
belief that it was vacant, she resolved upon a half hour in
the garden by herself. It was the day of the governor's
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, the event of the season, and it was no wonder the
house was quiet. Fanny had flashed into the school-room
late in the afternoon, in a ravishing toilette, to deliver a
message from her aunt, and to see if Rowly was ready, and
the younger children, gaping through the blinds, had seen
the carriage drive away, and had howled with discontent.
It was the night of their weekly bath, however, and on
such occasions, they were delivered over to the nurses an

<!-- page 459 -->

hour earlier than usual, and the governess had a holiday.
She had a very odd, emancipated, self-indulgent feeling as
she crossed the hall and stepped out on the balcony. The
sudden quiet was almost as startling as when, midway on
the ocean, the wearying sounds of a great steamer's
machinery abruptly ceases; the shock is greater than a clap
of thunder.</p>

<p>The young lady hardly felt as if she were in her right
mind or her right body, walking through the silent hall, or
descending into the tranquil, pleasant garden, without any
children hanging on her skirts, or any sharp eyes following
her steps. For the past week she had kept so nervously
out of sight and in the school-room, she could hardly realize
she was safe even in this solitude. With a most weary
gesture she pressed her hand against her brow as she
moved down the path: the cool air did not revive her, even
fresh as it came from the river; she paused a moment at
the door of the summer-house, then sank down languidly
upon the seat beside it, and leaned her cheek against the
lattice. How soft and cool the breeze was in her face;
how placid the river looked, gleaming through the trees;
how calm and quiet the evening sky bent over her. But it
seemed to her, her heart was dead. They might as well
have been shining on her grave.</p>

<p>The summer-house was an oblong building, with a table
running through the centre and seats at both ends. The
faint, dusky light, and perhaps her preoccupation, had
prevented the young lady from seeing she was not alone in
it. Some one arose as she entered, and making a hurried
step forward, stopped and gazed steadily at her. Her face

<!-- page 460 -->

was very clearly visible, lying wearily back against the dark
vine-covered lattice, and with the light from the door upon
it; it seemed to convey some startling story to the stranger,
for patting his hand to his forehead as if in pain, he murmured 
something half inaudible and leaned against the
lattice for support. The governess started up and turned
toward him; their eyes met for one long moment, then
Warren sank down on the seat, and bowed his head in his
hands upon the table. There was an unbroken silence for
some minutes; at last she said, speaking low, but not
moving from where she stood:</p>

<p>"I thought you were away; I did not mean you should
have seen me."</p>

<p>He did not move or raise his head, and she went on after
a moment, a little more quickly and huskily:</p>

<p>"I am sure you cannot blame me&mdash;no one can. I meant
you never should have known that I was in the house.
I have not left the school-room all this week. You cannot
doubt"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The river breaking with a low murmur at the foot of the
stone wall below, the faint western wind whispering among
the vines, were the only sounds of life for several minutes
in the tranquil garden; the young man did not move or
lift his head, his companion stood as if struck into marble,
but with a most supplicating, sorrowful and wistful look
upon her face as she turned toward him.</p>

<p>"You won't believe me," she said at last. "Oh, Warren, 
do not be so unkind, do but speak to me. Say you
have no angry recollections of the past&mdash;say I have had
nothing to do with your unhappiness, and you need never

<!-- page 461 -->

speak to me again; you can forget I am alive, you shall
not see me while you live&mdash;you shall not hear my name
again."</p>

<p>A low groan was the only answer; and throwing herself
upon her knees beside him, she clasped her hands upon his
arm and cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Warren, do not be unforgiving! Think how long
it is! Think how I have suffered! My pride is dead&mdash;long, 
long ago, ever since I asked you to forgive me first.
You did not answer my poor letter then&mdash;you will not
answer now. Oh, oh, this is worst of all! On my knees,
Warren&mdash;after five dreadful years of penance, five years of
labor, and loneliness, and wretchedness&mdash;I ask you to
forgive me, to say you are not angry, and you will not
answer."</p>

<p>"Yes, Georgy," he said, slowly raising his head, but
turning it from her, "yes, I will answer you. I have
nothing to forgive&mdash;it is all past long ago. I have forgiven
you and prayed for you ever since we parted. I do not
blame you, believe me, I do not blame you."</p>

<p>"But you do not love me," she murmured, bursting into
tears, and burying her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"I have prayed God I might not every day since last
I looked into your face," he said, huskily and low.</p>

<p>"You had no right to pray that&mdash;you had no right to
put me out of your heart," she cried, starting up and
turning from him.</p>

<p>"No right, when you had forgotten me, when you were
given to another?"</p>

<p>"Warren, you cannot think, you did not dream"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 462 -->

<p>"Did not dream? What are you saying?&mdash;be quick," he
exclaimed hurriedly, with a startled, strange look toward
her, as he pressed his hand upon his heart and gasped for
breath.</p>

<p>"You did not dream I could"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Georgy&mdash;the truth&mdash;quick. Sir Charles"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have never seen him since the day he told me you had
sailed."</p>

<p>"The marriage, then"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was married three months after. What, do you
doubt&mdash;do you not believe me! Warren, you are not
generous. I have never doubted you through all your
cruel silence. I know I deserved <i>that;</i> but I do not
deserve <i>this</i>."</p>

<p>"Georgy, do not reproach me; have I not been punished 
bitterly enough? Tell me if <i>you</i> can forgive, and if
I may believe this is not some wild, unreal dream!"</p>

<p>It was no dream: looking into the beautiful dark eyes he
had loved so long and so long striven to forget, clasping in
his own the hand he had never hoped to touch again on
earth, Warren Sutherland's dead and hopeless heart awoke
anew to living warmth. The long years of resignation that
he had offered to heaven were the safest, fittest preparation
for a bliss that too often proves a snare; a still, calm, deep
happiness had come on earth to crown his patience, when
he had only hoped for it in heaven&mdash;a happiness for which
he had sacrificed no duty, and for which he had not even
asked; it was purely the gift of the Master for whom he
had renounced it, and it bound him to His service by
doable ties of gratefulness.</p>

<!-- page 463 -->

<p>The wisdom of the children of this world stood in strange
contrast at that moment with the wisdom of the children of
light: the one, confounded, thwarted, blasted; the other,
crowned, rewarded, blessed.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Georgy, I cannot take you home to England;"
and Warren's smile was tenderer and sadder than lover's
smile had ever been before. "Can you give up home
for me?"</p>

<p>"I have no home, there or anywhere, except as you
shall give me one," she said. "I have been orphaned,
impoverished, expatriated too long to dictate my terms.
Anywhere, Warren, so long as you do not give me up
again."</p>

<p>"Then you will come to the Parsonage as soon as it is
finished?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Georgy simply. "I shall count the
days till you come back for me."</p>

<p>"They shall not be long, my dearest."</p>

<p>"But Laura&mdash;you have not told me about Laura. Is she
there? Has she forgotten me?"</p>

<p>"Wait till to-morrow," Warren said quietly. "There is
so much to tell; tell me of yourself to-night."</p>

<p>And so it happened, that the first hours of their new
happiness were not stained with the sadness the recital of
poor Laura's story must have brought to both. Georgy's
story, full of stern discipline, heavy sorrow, deep humiliation, 
was a sad one; but it fell far short of the unutterable

<!-- page 464 -->

anguish of poor Laura's. The one had been punished
bitterly for her pride, and all the errors of her girlhood;
but, chastened, humbled, conquered, she had at last, with
saddened but earnest eyes, seen the heavy cloud lift and the
future calm before her: but for the other, what future
could come after that awful night but a future of endurance,
submission, death? God help her!</p>

<p>She had not rebelled. When Warren first found her,
bending over the poor mother whose long trial had just
ended, and whose night of unconsciousness had just begun,
and heard, from the lips of the horror-struck servants that
Larry lay dead below the rocks on which poor Nattee had
met her cruel fate, he stood paralyzed at the sight of her
tearless composure. Not a tear, not a murmur, not a shadow 
of oblivion.</p>

<p>This unnatural calmness must give way in time, he
thought, as he watched her with yearning tenderness. But
it never did give way. The first terrible weeks of desolation 
passed, and then the longer months of solitude, and
still it never altered. Too quiet for despair, too marvellous
for resignation; she breathes the air of heaven already, he
thought; the angels have their arms about her, they are
leading her softly away. One burst of grief, one human
cry of pain, Warren would have given worlds to hear;
remembering his own despair at the time of his great trial,
his own ungovernable anguish, he could not believe her
strength could so exceed his own. But it was a different
trial, and a different strength; his strength was for life and
hers was for death; the end was determined of God, each
sorrow had its allotted outlet.</p>

<!-- page 465 -->

<p>A strange household that was, that went its silent ways
within those gloomy walls. The old man, blasted forever
in the sight of men, was yet suffered to live unmolested,
shunning and dreading those he met, yet safe from all but
their execration and contempt. The form of a trial, indeed,
had been passed through, but in those colonial days, the
administration of justice was but an exceptional and uncertain 
thing; irregularity and tardiness characterized all the
courts of law; the tribunal of the mother country seemed
almost as distant and as vague as that of Heaven, and was
not much more regarded, so that corruption and dishonesty
frequented very high places without putting themselves in
any danger of arrest, and equity and justice, indeed, seemed
fallen in the streets. The high position, great wealth and
extended influence of the Sutherland family, readily explained 
the extraordinary result of this trial; popular
indignation was not heard of in those days, when we sucked
the breasts of kings, when free and righteous Albion held
the scales in which our justice was meted out to us; the
people, whose blood had run cold at the old man's horrid
crime, could now warm it at the fire of their righteous
indignation.</p>

<p>Ralph Sutherland was convicted of the murder of his
slave, and was sentenced, for the remainder of his life, to
wear about his neck a halter, and to appear once every
year before the assembled legal body of the province. But
to give this mockery of condemnation a show of terror, and
to satisfy the instinct that demanded blood for blood, a
most extraordinary clause was inserted, providing that, if
the accused should reach the age of ninety-nine, he then

<!-- page 466 -->

should suffer the extreme penalty of the law, and be hung
by the neck till dead.</p>

<p>No doubt the old man breathed freer when he heard his
sentence, and felt that life was sweet on any terms; no
doubt he felt a faint restoration of hope when he found that
the bitterness of death was passed and that he was assured
of life. But his hope of satisfaction in it must have been
short lived; it seemed to grow a heavier burden to him
every day. He noticed no member of his household, he
could be made to feel no interest in the management of his
estate; it was not blankness and apathy, it was something
infinitely worse to bear, it was the dread, clear certainty
that nothing now could yield him profit, pleasure or amelioration 
of his pain.</p>

<p>The affairs about which he had once been so inexorably
exact, were now utterly neglected and abandoned; if it had
not been for Warren's persuasion and influence, not a slave
except Rube would have remained to work the farm. As
it was, since that dreadful night, not one of them could be
made to sleep under the haunted roof. A neighboring
farmhouse was repaired and rudely furnished for them,
where they slept and took their meals, doing their work
very much at their own option and according to their own
judgment. Little Steady was the only assistant Laura had
in the duties of the household. Superstition and remorse
had aided selfishness effectually, and Salome had been the
first to desert the roof that had so long sheltered and protected 
her.</p>

<p>The old man saw the breaking up his household and the
scattering of his servants with simple unconcern. All

<!-- page 467 -->

ugliness and vindictiveness of temper were gone; they
would have given an animation to his dead life which would
have ameliorated its heavy burden. It was impossible to
think, either, that his mind had received any damage from
the shock of his son's death and his own revolting crime,
for his faculties seemed all unimpaired, his memory vigorous, 
and his judgment clear. No dullness or oblivion had
fallen to take the edge off of his punishment, no paralysis
of the mind, no morbid melancholy, even, dimming the
consciousness of what he had done and what he must
endure, or diverting it into one distorted and arbitrary
channel, but with acute possession of intelligence and reason,
and with strangely sustained endurance, he saw his wrecked
and blasted fortunes in the fullest, strongest light. Remorse&mdash;not 
violent, passionate, self-destructive and exhausting, 
but remorse that grew upon him, slow, steady, strong,
fastening itself upon his soul, fitting itself into it, binding
itself about it, this remorse was his companion night and
day. His pain of mind was not intense nor racking enough
to wear his body out, and his body, as yet, refused to
prey upon his mind. The blankness and desolation of
the present, the blackness and shamefulness of the past,
the awfulness of the future, these he saw with eyes made
clear and strong for the perfection of his punishment.</p>

<p>No groan, no transport of remorse escaped him. Sometimes, 
from the depths of his strange eye, Warren caught
a gleam that made him shudder; but he could not preach
repentance to him; this was a soul beyond his cure, beyond
his care. God alone was preacher, pastor, now.</p>

<p>A strange household, indeed, from the stricken, speechless 

<!-- page 468 -->

old man who had once been its despot, to the thoughtful, 
silent child, who was now its only servitor. The fair
pale girl who stole like a shadow from room to room, now
bending over the smitten and unconscious mother in her
helpless imbecility, now following with womanly gentleness
and consolation, the wayward steps of the old man, or ministering 
with silent and sisterly tenderness to the unselfish
wants of her sad and silent brother&mdash;one and all attempted
no disguise of cheerfulness, but trusted to Heaven to
receive instead their patient resignation.</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, as if but little separated them from
the silent realm of waiting spirits, and when first the poor
mother, and then her sad attendant, were laid in the little
churchyard, with Larry beside them, and with Nattee at
their feet, there were no tears shed over them by those
left behind; Steady's eyes grew thoughtfuller and deeper,
and Warren's face grew paler and more saintly, but the
old man did not change, and the household ways moved
on unaltered.</p>

<p>Summer shed its blossoms and winter spread its snows
again and again over the gloomy house, but brought few
other changes to the silent trio within. The discovery
that, instead of being penniless wanderers, he and Laura
had long been the heirs of almost princely wealth, came
too late to Warren to bring him anything but pain. It
was something more to estrange him from his uncle, and it
gave him another regret for home, and a new pang for
poor Laura's blighted life. The pleasures and possessions
of this world never could entice him again, but they could
encumber him with cares and vexations manifold, and it

<!-- page 469 -->

was with a very sad and unwilling heart that he left his
mountain home, in the third June after Laura's death, and
entered again, for the first time, the busy haunts of worldly
men.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible to him that it was only five years
since he had left England and been secluded in that wild
region to which he had consecrated his life and talents; his
whole life, his entire existence, seem bounded by those
blue peaks; all beyond, all that had come before, was
misty and unreal. There was another life outside them he
began to see. There were beautiful women, strong-souled,
grand and earnest men, there were intellect, luxury, refinement, 
from which he had been cut off so long they had
become but names to him. He appreciated and enjoyed
them, they answered to what was in himself unchanged,
but they could not tempt him away from the post he had
resolved to hold through life. Those few sheep in the wilderness 
were his dearest care, those lonely graves upon the
hillside marked his real home.</p>

<p>And when, in the soft twilight of that beautiful June day,
the chastening angel, whose heavy hand he had felt so long,
led back to him his early, only love, saddened, purified,
ennobled, her beautiful brows crowned with the same virtues 
he had striven to win, her eyes turned forever from
the world in which he had thought her lost, her heart true
to him through all&mdash;he only sunk a moment, stunned by
the greatness of his happiness, then rose stronger, manlier,
more earnest.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX.</p>

<p class="small">RALPH SUTHERLAND'S HALTER.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">"Long die thy happy days before thy death!"</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Richard III</span>.</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> years came and went, with no giddy swiftness, no
hurrying tumult, in Warren and Georgy's mountain home,
but calmly, goldenly, tranquilly, rich with the "blessing of
peace" with which they had begun. Children grew up
around them, plans prospered in their hands, duties turned
to pleasures, pleasures were sanctified by the benediction
of heaven, and the few sorrows that fell upon their path,
shadowed lightly but did not darken it.</p>

<p>But gloomier and most sombre by contrast was the dark
home where Ralph Sutherland dragged out the weary
years. Almost daily Warren went there, and Georgy's
womanly care and thought showed itself in a thousand ways
about the old house: she was the nearest approach to a
mistress that Steady had, and Steady would never have
been content if she had had no one to obey. Georgy never
could quite understand why Warren had been so resolute
not to make that their home&mdash;it seemed so cruel to leave the
old man there with his single faithful little maid. But it
would have been crueller, Warren knew, to have chained a
fresh, elastic life within that dreary shade&mdash;to have brought
up children under the blight and mildew of that gloomy

<!-- page 471 -->

roof. He never could shake off the oppression that the
approach to that house occasioned; to the latest day of his
life, he never entered it but with a shudder, and never left
it but with a feeling of relief. He wondered as he watched
his little children play fearlessly about the deserted rooms,
and dance up and down the darkened hall. Poor Larry!
whose sons and daughters should have frolicked there!</p>

<p>If the old man's life had an interest, it was in listening
for the patter of those little feet. True to his old habit, he
never would look up or notice them, while they struggled
at the lock or romped across the room, but only turned his
eyes upon them when they climbed his knee or hung around
his chair. He never laid his hand upon their heads, or in
any manner ever caressed or played with them: it was
wonderful that they cared to be with him, used as they
were to endearments and indulgences from every other
hand.</p>

<p>But there was a charm in the seclusion of the old house,
in its shut-up rooms, its musty pantries, its unexplored
recesses and retreats. That was not all that drew them
toward it, though. They would follow the old man about
the fields for hours, or, in the dim twilight, sit clustering
about his feet, chatting childishly and harmlessly, wreathing
their baby hopes and fears and pleasures around the grim
old shattered trunk to which they had attached themselves.
Unmoved and silent, though, while the young tendrils knit
themselves about him: he never told them stories or enticed 
their confidence, he only looked at them with his
strange attentive eye, and let them pour out their childish
hearts unchecked.</p>

<!-- page 472 -->

<p>But there was a blot upon this intercourse, a poison in
this, his nearest approach to pleasure. Continually they
whispered, when they climbed his knee and hung about
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you always wear this cord around your neck,
and why do you hide it so?"</p>

<p>The touch of their innocent hands upon this token of his
crime would seem to move him more than anything else had
ever done. He would put them off his lap, hurriedly disengage 
their arms from around his neck, and walk unsteadily
up and down the room, then turn perhaps and leave them
for the remainder of the day. It seemed a matter of indifference 
to him that his neighbors shunned and feared him&mdash;that, 
for weeks together, no stranger would come near his
house&mdash;that when he walked abroad, the very children
shrunk away in awe. No emotion seemed to be awakened
in his mind when stories of the people's superstitions regarding 
him and his grim abode came sometimes to his
ears. The country people would walk miles around to
avoid passing within earshot of it. Ghosts, they believed,
were its habitual tenants: poor murdered Nattee, chained
to her ghastly horse, dashed nightly past the old man's
window&mdash;the clatter of his hoofs upon the rocks re&euml;choed
there the whole night long&mdash;a pale bride, with her white
veil drooping, and her hands clasped mournfully, wandered
moaning through the vacant rooms; the maniac mother,
beating upon her breast, pierced the air with shrieks of
agony, bewailing her lost son.</p>

<p>The old man heard these stories and knew this belief but
they never seemed to give him one pang more or less&mdash;the

only earthly or superhuman agency that had power to move
him, were those baby hands about his neck. Whole days
together he would exclude them from his presence; and
when, at length, he readmitted them, with unerring instinct
they would clamor for his knee, and dart, perhaps, before
he could arrest their eager fingers, upon this mysterious
token. It was in vain that he hid it deep beneath his garments&mdash;that 
he taxed his ingenuity to conceal it from their
touch: a nestling head would press against it, and a curious
hand would be thrust in to drag it to the light:</p>

<p>"Why do you wear this always round your neck, and
why do you hide it so?"</p>

<p>But the children grew into youths and maidens&mdash;some
married and went to distant homes, and some lay down to
rest in narrower but stiller homes in the churchyard on the
hill; and yet the old man's breath was even and his eye
unclouded. Changes, such as few men live to see, passed
upon those around, and left him untouched. He saw the
young let go their eager hold on life, and lay down dumb
in death; he saw the old sink quietly into waiting graves,
and the middle-aged give grudgingly up their careful idols,
and obey God's summons. He saw revolutions convulse the
State, a republic born, a nation started into life, wars rage
and cease, great names made, and great men rise, and reign,
and die; and still his worthless blank dead life clung round
him&mdash;still his dreary burden must be carried.</p>

<p>The slow years grew heavier and slower, as they neared
that once distant goal; each day had its own dire, distinct, 
increasing weight of dread; he felt life enough in
his pulses to carry him beyond that point&mdash;vitality enough

to hold him in the flesh, till Justice should have had her
due.</p>

<p>But he need not have feared: men had forgotten, if God
had not. A new government held the reins&mdash;a new generation 
had arisen&mdash;the old man and his crime were things
long buried in the past. In the hurry and tumult of the
present, old reckonings were lost sight of, old promises
were obliterated: the appointed period of retribution came
and passed, and Ralph Sutherland died quietly in his bed,
undisturbed of men, and only judged of God, in the hundredth 
year of his strange and sinful life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note*</span>.&mdash;The extraordinary sentence passed upon the murderer, his
strangely extended life, and the manner of his victim's death, are traditions

author does not vouch for their truth, but there are many, better informed, 
who do.</p>
