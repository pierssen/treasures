<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THIS first volume of such of the Works of F&eacute;nelon as
we think worthy of being reproduced in English dress,
is composed of:&mdash;1st, Lamartine's Life of F&eacute;nelon; 2d,
an Essay on the Genius and Character of F&eacute;nelon, by
M. Villemain; 3d, Critical Opinions upon F&eacute;nelon
and his Works; 4th, a Bibliographical Notice; and
5th, "The Adventures of Telemachus."</p>

<p>Lamartine's Life of F&eacute;nelon is full in detail, most
eloquent in style and matter, and heartily sympathetic.
We have used the translation made in England for
Mr. Bentley, but have compared it, sentence by sentence,
with the original, and have corrected it in many
places. The translation is good, and our corrections
have been made in the same spirit in which we should
like to be corrected ourselves.</p>

<p>The article of M. Villemain, which he calls a "Notice,"
we have entitled an Essay on the Character and
Genius of F&eacute;nelon. Lamartine judges the good Archbishop
of Cambray from an historical and political point
of view; Villemain judges him as a writer and a moralist,
and assigns him his place in French literature.
The fine article, "F&eacute;nelon," in the "Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica," has been literally taken, without acknowledgment,

<!-- page 6 -->

from this Notice of Villemain. In our translation
of it we have endeavored to give the sense, but
have not hoped to preserve the pleasing eloquence and
delicate &aelig;sthetic finish of the original.</p>

<p>The Critical Opinions upon F&eacute;nelon and his Works
are not designed to forestall or exhaust criticism, but
to show, as nearly as may be, through <i>representative</i>
critics, in what estimation F&eacute;nelon is held by English
readers.</p>

<p>The aim of the Bibliographical Notice is to point
out at a glance the subjects that engaged the attention
of F&eacute;nelon, and to afford exact information in regard
to the best editions of his works.</p>

<p>"Telemachus," which forms the body of the book, is
in the translation of Dr. Hawkesworth. The translation
is well known and excellent, but we have revised
it from beginning to end. Every word of it has been
compared with the original in the edition of Lef&egrave;vre.
Our corrections amount to thousands, but many of them
are merely verbal and unimportant. Here and there
the Doctor has waxed enthusiastic, and has added
matter quite his own, which we have invariably eliminated.
Very often the vivacity of the original has
been weakened by throwing many well-balanced periods
into one long, rambling sentence, "tediously
drawling its 'ands.' " We have checked him in form
as well as matter. But, in all fairness, we must give
him a chance to be heard, and here introduce his
preface:</p>

<p>"The Telemachus of the celebrated Archbishop of
Cambray is a work of such reputation that it would be
scarce less absurd to recommend it than to recommend

<!-- page 7 -->

the writings of Homer and Virgil: it holds the
first class among the moral works of imagination in
France; it has passed through innumerable editions;
art has been exhausted to adorn it, and learning to illustrate
its beauties; it has been translated into every
language in Europe, the Turkish not excepted; and
there are no less than five translations of it in our own.
To translate it, indeed, is easy; but to translate it so
as to give it the same rank in a foreign language that
it holds in the original, is difficult. It has generally
been thought that a perfect knowledge of the corresponding
words, through all their inflexions, in two
languages, is a sufficient qualification to translate one
into the other; and, consequently, that a fine book in
one language will, in the hands of a translator so qualified,
necessarily become a fine book in another. This,
however, is so far from being true, that a book which
has any merit besides that of truth and sentiment in
the abstract, will be bad in the version, in proportion
as it is good in the original, if the translator be qualified
only for verbal interpretation.</p>

<p>"To translate a work of fancy, which owes great part
of its power to poetical beauties and elegance of composition,
some taste for poetry and some skill in writing
is certainly necessary, of which all who have hitherto
translated F&eacute;nelon's Telemachus into English were
totally destitute: their versions, indeed, are, in general,
too much the same; that, one having failed, it is
difficult to conceive what encouraged the hope that
another would succeed. My translation is, at least,
very different from all others; and yet I have scrupulously
preserved, not only every incident and every

<!-- page 8 -->

sentiment, but even every metaphor, as far as the different
genius of the two languages would admit.</p>

<p>"To those who have read this work only as an exercise
at school, its beauties are wholly unknown; and
among those that have learned French in this country,
there is not, probably, above one in fifty who can now
read it in the original with more advantages than a native
of France would read Pope's Rape of the Lock in
a prose translation.</p>

<p>"To both these, therefore, as well as to persons who
are wholly unacquainted with the French language,
this version, if I have been able to accomplish my purpose,
may be acceptable; it may also facilitate and
sweeten the labor of those that are learning it; it may
give them a relish for a book that will probably be
put into their hands; and though it may not much
assist them in a mere verbal construction, it may perhaps
show them its insufficiency, and excite an attempt
to transfuse the spirit with the sense.</p>

<p>"My principal view, however, was much more extensive
than to assist learners of the French language.
I have attempted to render a work full of ingenious
fiction, just reasoning, important precepts, and poetical
imagery, as pleasing in English as it is in French, to
those who read it as their native tongue. If I have
succeeded, I have not only made a valuable addition
to our polite literature, but rendered my country a
much more important service, by putting into the
hands of our youth one of the few books which genius
and learning have dedicated to virtue, which at once
captivates the imagination, informs the understanding
and regulates the will."</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p>We are sure that our corrections are, for the most
part, just such as Dr. Hawkesworth would have accepted
from any friend who might have assisted him
in revising his work for the press.</p>

<p>We have added, in the form of foot-notes, literal
translations of those passages of the ancient authors
which F&eacute;nelon formally imitated. These passages
were first collected in the Hamburg edition of 1732,
and have often been reproduced since. Most will
thank us for giving translations of them, instead of
leaving them in the Greek and Latin original.</p>

<p>Scholars will understand us when we simply say
that we have corrected the translation of Dr. Hawkesworth
by the <i>text</i> of Lef&egrave;vre, who has himself followed
that of the Abb&eacute; Caron.</p>

<p>We have also followed Lef&egrave;vre in dividing Telemachus
into eighteen instead of twenty-four books.
"The manuscripts," says the French editor, "indubitably
prove that the author divided it into eighteen
books. The Marquis de F&eacute;nelon, who first introduced,
in his edition of 1717, the division into twenty-four
books, says that his uncle had thus divided 'Telemachus,'
in imitation of the 'Iliad;' but this assertion
lacks valid proofs; and although the <i>parole</i> of a man
so justly esteemed is entitled to great consideration,
still the hand of the author himself must have, in this
question of literary criticism, a much higher authority."</p>

<p>TELEMACHUS.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p class="center"><a href="#tb01">BOOK I.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus, conducted by Minerva under the likeness of Mentor, lands,
after having suffered shipwreck, upon the island of the goddess Calypso,
who is still regretting the departure of Ulysses. The goddess receives
him favorably, conceives a passion for him, offers him immortality, and
inquires after his adventures. He recounts his voyage to Pylos and
Laced&aelig;mon; his shipwreck on the coast of Sicily; the danger he was
in of being offered as a sacrifice to the manes of Anchises; the assistance
which Mentor and he gave Acestes against an incursion of barbarians,
and the gratitude of the king, who, to reward their service, gave them
a Tyrian vessel, that they might return to their country.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb02">BOOK II.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus relates his being taken in the Tyrian vessel by the fleet of
Sesostris, and carried captive into Egypt. He describes the beauty of
the country, and the wise government of its king. He relates also that
Mentor was sent a slave into Ethiopia; that he was himself reduced
to keep sheep in the deserts of Oasis; that in this state he was comforted
by Termosiris, a priest of Apollo, who taught him to imitate that
god, who had once been the shepherd of Admetus; that Sesostris, having

<!-- page 12 -->

at length heard with astonishment what his influence and example
had effected among the shepherds, determined to see him, and being
convinced of his innocence, promised to send him to Ithaca, but that the
death of Sesostris overwhelmed him with new calamities; and that he
was imprisoned in a tower which overlooked the sea, from whence he
saw Bocchoris, the new king, slain in a battle against part of his subjects,
who had revolted, and had called in the Tyrians to their assistance.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb03">BOOK III.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus relates that, the successor of Bocchoris releasing all the Tyrian
prisoners, he was himself sent to Tyre, on board the vessel of Narbal,
who had commanded the Tyrian fleet; that Narbal gave him a description
of Pygmalion their king, and expressed apprehensions of danger
from the cruelty of his avarice; that he afterwards instructed him in
the commercial regulations of Tyre; and that, being about to embark in
a Cyprian vessel, in order to proceed by the isle of Cyprus to Ithaca,
Pygmalion discovered that he was a stranger, and ordered him to be
seized; that his life was thus brought into the most imminent danger,
but that he had been preserved by the tyrant's mistress Astarbe, that
she might, in his stead, destroy a young Lyctian of whom she had been
enamored, but who rejected her for another; that he finally embarked
in a Cyprian vessel, to return to Ithaca by the way of Cyprus.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb04">BOOK IV.</a></p>

<p>Calypso interrupts Telemachus in his relation, that he may retire to rest.
Mentor privately reproves him for having undertaken the recital of his
adventures; but as he has begun, advises him to proceed. Telemachus
relates that during his voyage from Tyre to Cyprus, he dreamed that
he was protected from Venus and Cupid by Minerva; that he afterwards
imagined he saw Mentor, who exhorted him to fly from the isle
of Cyprus; that when he awaked, the vessel would have perished in a
storm if he had not himself taken the helm, the Cyprians being all intoxicated
with wine; that when he arrived on the island, he saw, with
horror, the most contagious examples of debauchery; but that Hazael,
the Syrian, to whom Mentor had been sold, happening to be at Cyprus
at the same time, brought the two friends together, and took them on
board his vessel that was bound to Crete; that during the voyage, he
had seen Amphitrite drawn in her chariot by sea-horses&mdash;a sight infinitely
entertaining and magnificent.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb05">BOOK V.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus relates, that when he arrived at Crete, he learnt that Idomeneus,
the king of that island, had, in consequence of a rash vow, sacrificed

<!-- page 13 -->

his only son; that the Cretans, to revenge the murder, had driven
him out of the country; that after long uncertainty they were then
assembled to elect a new sovereign; that he was admitted into the assembly;
that he obtained the prize in various exercises; having also
resolved the questions that had been recorded by Minos in the book
of his laws, the sages, who were judges of the contest, and all the
people, seeing his wisdom, would have made him king; that he refused
the royalty of Crete to return to Ithaca; that he proposed Mentor, but
that Mentor also refused to be king; that the Cretans then pressing
Mentor to appoint a king for them, he relates to them what he heard of
the virtues of Aristodemus, whom they immediately proclaimed; that
Mentor and Telemachus having embarked for Italy, Neptune, to gratify
the resentment of Venus, shipwrecked them on the island of Calypso,
where the goddess received them with hospitality and kindness.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb06">BOOK VI.</a></p>

<p>Calypso admires Telemachus for his adventures, and exerts all her power
to detain him in her island, by inciting him to return her passion; but
he is sustained by the wisdom and friendship of Mentor, as well against
her artifices as against the power of Cupid, whom Venus sends to her
assistance. Telemachus, however, and Eucharis become mutually enamored
of each other, which provokes Calypso first to jealousy, and then
to rage. She swears, by the Styx, that Telemachus shall leave her island,
and engages Mentor to build a ship to take him back to Ithaca. She is
consoled by Cupid, who excites the nymphs to burn the vessel which
had been built by Mentor, while Mentor was laboring to get Telemachus
on board. Telemachus is touched with a secret joy at this event. Mentor,
who perceives it, throws him from a rock into the sea, and leaps
after him, that they may swim to another vessel which appeared not far
distant from the shore.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb07">BOOK VII.</a></p>

<p>The vessel proves to be a Tyrian, commanded by Adoam, the brother of
Narbal, by whom the adventurers are kindly received. Adoam recollects
Telemachus, and relates the tragical death of Pygmalion and
Astarbe, and the accession of Baleazar, whom the tyrant his father had
disgraced at her instigation. During a banquet which he prepares for
his guests, Achitoas entertains them with music, which brings the Tritons,
the Nereids, and other divinities of the sea, in crowds around the
vessel. Mentor, taking up a lyre, plays much better than Achitoas.
Adoam relates the wonders of B&oelig;tica: he describes the soft temperature
of the air, and the beauties of the country, where the utmost simplicity
of manners secures to the people uninterrupted tranquillity.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p class="center"><a href="#tb08">BOOK VIII.</a></p>

<p>Venus, still incensed against Telemachus, requests of Jupiter that he may
perish; but this not being permitted by the Fates, the goddess consults
with Neptune how his return to Ithaca, whither Adoam is conducting
him, may be prevented. They employ an illusive divinity to deceive
Acamas the pilot, who, supposing the land before him to be Ithaca,
enters full sail into the port of Salentum. Telemachus is kindly received
by Idomeneus in his new city, where he is preparing a sacrifice to Jupiter,
that he may be successful in a war against the Mandurians. The
entrails of the victims being consulted by the priest, he perceives the
omens to be happy, but declares that Idomeneus will owe his good fortune
to his guests.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb09">BOOK IX.</a></p>

<p>Idomeneus acquaints Mentor with the cause of the war: he tells him that
the Mandurians ceded to him the coast of Hesperia, where he had
founded his new city as soon as he arrived; that they withdrew to the
neighboring mountains, where having been ill-treated by some of his
people, they had sent deputies with whom he had settled articles of
peace; and that after a breach of that treaty, on the part of Idomeneus,
by some hunters who knew nothing of it, the Mandurians prepared to
attack him. During this recital, the Mandurians, having already taken
arms, appear at the gates of Salentum. Nestor, Philoctetes, and Phalanthus,
whom Idomeneus supposed to be neuter, appear to have joined
them with their forces. Mentor goes out of Salentum alone, and proposes
new conditions of peace. Telemachus seeing Mentor in the midst
of the allies, is impatient to know what passes between them. He causes
the gates of Salentum to be opened, and joins his friend. His presence
inclines the allies to accept the terms that Mentor has offered on the
part of Idomeneus. The allies enter Salentum as friends. Idomeneus
confirms the propositions of Mentor; hostages are reciprocally given; and
all parties assist at a sacrifice between the city and the camp, as a
solemn ratification of the treaty.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb10">BOOK X.</a></p>

<p>Nestor, in the name of the allies, demands succors of Idomeneus against
their enemies the Daunians. Mentor, who is desirous to establish proper
regulations for the internal government of Salentum, and to employ the
people in agriculture, finds means to satisfy them with a hundred noble
Cretans, under the command of Telemachus. After their departure
Mentor proceeds to a minute examination of the city and the port; and
having acquainted himself with every particular, he prevails upon Idomeneus

<!-- page 15 -->

to institute new principles of government and commerce,&mdash;to
divide his people into seven classes, distinguishing them with respect to
their rank and quality by different habits,&mdash;to retrench luxury and unnecessary
arts, and to employ the artificers in husbandry, which he brings
into just reputation.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb11">BOOK XI.</a></p>

<p>Idomeneus relates to Mentor his confidence in Protesilaus, and the artifices
of that favorite, in concert with Timocrates, to betray him and destroy
Philocles. He confesses, that being prejudiced against him by these
confederates, he sent Timocrates to kill him while he was abroad with
the command of a fleet upon a dangerous expedition. Timocrates having
failed in his attempt, Philocles forbore to avenge himself by taking
his life, but, resigning the command of the fleet to Polymenes, who had
been appointed to succeed him in the written orders for his death, he
retired to the isle of Samos. Idomeneus adds that he at length discovered
the perfidy of Protesilaus, but that, even then, he could not shake
off his influence. Mentor prevails upon Idomeneus to banish Protesilaus
and Timocrates to the island of Samos, and recall Philocles to his
confidence and councils. Hegesippus, who is charged with this order,
executes it with joy. He arrives with his prisoners at Samos, where he
finds his friend Philocles in great indigence and obscurity, but content.
He at first refuses to return, but the gods having signified it to be their
pleasure, he embarks with Hegesippus, and arrives at Salentum, where
Idomeneus, who now sustains a new character, receives him with great
friendship.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb12">BOOK XII.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus, in the camp of the allies, gains the friendship of Philoctetes,
who was not at first favorably disposed to him, on his father's account.
Philoctetes relates his adventures, and introduces a particular account
of the death of Hercules by the poisoned garment which the centaur
Nessus had given to Dejanira. He relates how he obtained from that
hero his poisoned arrows, without which the city of Troy could not have
been taken; how he was punished for betraying his secret, by various
sufferings, in the island of Lemnos; and how Ulysses employed Neoptolemus
to engage him in the expedition against Troy, where he was cured
of his wound.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb13">BOOK XIII.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus quarrels with Phalanthus about some prisoners, to which each
of them lays claim: he fights and vanquishes Hippias, who, despising his
youth, had seized the prisoners in question for his brother; but being

<!-- page 16 -->

afterwards ashamed of his victory, he laments in secret his rashness and
indiscretion, for which he is very desirous to atone. At the same time
Adrastus, king of the Daunians, being informed that the allies were wholly
taken up in reconciling Telemachus and Hippias, marches to attack them
by surprise. After having seized a hundred of their vessels to transport
his own troops to their camp, he first sets it on fire, and then falls
upon Phalanthus' quarters. Phalanthus himself is desperately wounded,
and his brother Hippias slain. Telemachus, having put on his divine
armor, runs to the assistance of Phalanthus; he kills Iphicles, the son
of Adrastus, repulses the victorious enemy, and would have put an end
to the war if a tempest had not intervened. Telemachus orders the
wounded to be carried off, and takes great care of them, particularly of
Phalanthus. He performs the solemnities of the funeral of Hippias himself,
and having collected his ashes in a golden urn, presents them to
his brother.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb14">BOOK XIV.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus being persuaded, by several dreams, that his father Ulysses
was no longer alive, executes his design of seeking him among the dead.
He retires from the camp, and is followed by two Cretans as far as a
temple near the celebrated cavern of Acherontia. He enters it, and
descends through the gloom to the borders of the Styx, where Charon
takes him into his boat. He presents himself before Pluto, who, in
obedience to superior powers, permits him to seek his father. He passes
through Tartarus, and is witness to the torments that are inflicted upon
ingratitude, perjury, impiety, hypocrisy, and above all upon bad kings.
He then enters the Elysian Fields, where he is known by his great
grandfather, Arcesius, who assures him that Ulysses is still alive, that
he shall see him in Ithaca, and succeed to his throne. Arcesius describes
the felicity of the just, especially of good kings, who have reverenced
the gods and given happiness to their people. He makes Telemachus
observe that heroes, those who have excelled only in the arts of
destruction, have a much less glorious reward, and are allotted a separate
district by themselves. Telemachus receives some general instructions,
and then returns back to the camp.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb15">BOOK XV.</a></p>

<p>Venusium having been left as a deposit by both parties in the hands of the
Lucanians, Telemachus declares against seizing it in an assembly of the
chiefs, and persuades them to be of his opinion. He discovers great
penetration and sagacity with respect to two deserters, one of whom,
Acanthus, had undertaken to poison him; and the other, Dioscorus, had
offered to bring him Adrastus' head. In the battle which soon after
follows, Telemachus strews the field with dead in search of Adrastus.

<!-- page 17 -->

Adrastus, who is also in search of Telemachus, engages and kills Pisistratus,
the son of Nestor; Philoctetes comes up, and, at the moment
when he is about to pierce Adrastus, is himself wounded, and obliged to
retire. Telemachus, alarmed by the cry of his friends, among whom
Adrastus is making a terrible slaughter, rushes to their assistance. He
engages Adrastus, and prescribes conditions upon which he gives him
his life. Adrastus, rising from the ground, attempts treacherously to
kill his conqueror by surprise, who engages him a second time, and kills
him.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb16">BOOK XVI.</a></p>

<p>The chiefs assemble to deliberate upon the demand of the Daunians, that
one of their own nation may be given them for a king. Nestor, being
inconsolable for the loss of his son, absents himself from the assembly
of the chiefs, where some are of opinion that the conquered lands should
be divided among them, and allot the territory of Arpi to Telemachus.
Telemachus rejects this offer, and convinces the chiefs that it is their
common interest to appoint Polydamas king of the Daunians, and leave
them in possession of their country. He afterwards persuades the
Daunians to bestow Arpi upon Diomedes, who had accidentally landed
upon their coast. Hostilities being now at an end, the allies separate,
and every one returns to his country.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#tb17">BOOK XVII.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus, on his return to Salentum, is surprised to see the country so
well cultivated, and to find so little appearance of magnificence in the
city. Mentor accounts for these alterations, and points out the principal
causes that prevent national prosperity. He proposes the conduct and
government of Idomeneus as a model. Telemachus discovers to Mentor
his desire to marry the daughter of Idomeneus, Antiope. Mentor
approves of the choice, and assures him that she is designed for him by
the gods; but that at present he should think only of returning to
Ithaca, and delivering Penelope from her suitors. Idomeneus, fearing
the departure of his guests, proposes several embarrassing affairs to
Mentor, and assures him that without his assistance they cannot be adjusted.
Mentor lays down general principles for his conduct, but continues
steady in his purpose of departing with Telemachus for Ithaca.
Idomeneus tries another expedient to detain them: he encourages the
passion of Telemachus for Antiope, and engages him and Mentor in a
hunting party with his daughter. She is in the utmost danger from a
wild boar, but is delivered by Telemachus. He feels great reluctance to
leave her, and has not fortitude to bid Idomeneus farewell. Being encouraged
by Mentor, he surmounts his difficulties, and embarks for his
country.</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p class="center"><a href="#tb18">BOOK XVIII.</a></p>

<p>Telemachus, during the voyage, prevails upon Mentor to explain many difficulties
in the art of government, particularly that of distinguishing the
characters of men, so as to employ the good, and avoid being deceived
by the bad. During this conversation, a calm obliges them to put into a
little island where Ulysses had just gone ashore. Telemachus sees and
speaks to him without knowing who he is; but, after having seen him
embark, feels a secret uneasiness, of which he cannot imagine the cause.
Mentor explains it, and comforts him, assuring him that he shall soon
meet with his father again. He puts his patience and piety to another
trial, by detaining him to sacrifice to Minerva. Finally, the goddess,
who had been concealed under the figure of Mentor, resumes her own
form, and is known and acknowledged by Telemachus. She gives him
her last instructions, and disappears. Telemachus arrives in Ithaca, and
finds his father at the house of his faithful servant Eumenes.</p>

<p>OF all modern men, F&eacute;nelon bears the strongest resemblance
to the sages of antiquity. His countenance is beautiful as that
portrayed by Raphael when he represents St. John slumbering
upon the bosom of his Divine Master. His conversation
while traversing the gardens of Versailles resembles that of
Plato amid the shades of Academus. He holds the lyre of
Homer, and sings, like one inspired, the sacred records of the
past; he inhabits the dwelling of a monarch illustrious as
Cyrus, or Sesostris, where he gives lessons of wisdom, heroism,
and divine morality to the young prince. He walks clothed
in the sacred robe of the temple, through the corridors of a
palace. He passes from the court to the altar, from solitude
to the encounter of wit with politicians and learned men, to
the society of courtiers and favorites of his royal master. We
behold him as a legislator and a poet, a statesman and a pontiff,
desirous of associating Christian love and charity with the
councils of government; and of seeing, as in ancient Egypt,
religious and civil law hand in hand with the politics of
empire. In the antechamber of despotic power, he meditates
upon the institutions of liberty. He penetrates as it were
from the sublime height of his piety, the perfections and
chimeras of that political code, which became the germ and
sometimes the snare of those philosophic legislators, the parents
of the French Revolution.  His lamentations over the condition

<!-- page 20 -->

of the people, and the lessons he inculcates in his youthful
pupil, disquiet the king, who, fearing to see the spirit of royalty
degenerate in his heir, from that exaggerated virtue which,
desirous of changing an empire into a Utopia, opens (though
with good intent) a yawning gulf of destruction, banishes
F&eacute;nelon from the seat of government. The philosopher retires
weeping over the destiny of his country and his prince. He
seeks and finds the consolations of religion, and in his solitude
shows an example of that virtue so difficult of attainment to
men of genius&mdash;humility. Unable to improve the legislature,
he seeks but to govern and sanctify his own spirit, and dies in
his retreat the victim of inactivity and a holy sadness. His
works and noble qualities expand and multiply from his tomb,
as the liquid rushes from a vase, broken and crushed beneath
the feet of its destroyers; while his name becomes the type of
poetry, of political wisdom, and of all goodness, during two
centuries.</p>

<p>Such is F&eacute;nelon. Shall he not be called the Pythagoras or
Plato of France? Let us now trace this life, one of the most
beautiful of the latter ages.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon was a descendant of a noble military family of
Perigord, who, living sometimes in the camp, sometimes in the
retirement of their native province, and surrounded only by
rustics, were untainted by the air of courts. His father, Pons
de Salignac, Comte de F&eacute;nelon, retired from the army, and
married Isabelle d'Esparb&egrave;s, by whom he had several children.
A widower and somewhat advanced in years, he entered into
a second alliance with Louise de Saint-Abre,<sup id="cr01_ref001"><a href="#cr01_en001">1</a></sup> the daughter of
a noble house in the same province. This union was the
cause of much annoyance to his children, who murmured
against the conduct of their father. They feared that the
probable increase of family would so diminish the inheritance
of each, as to cause their decline from the high rank they had
hitherto held in the country. Antoine de F&eacute;nelon, the uncle
of these young people, having been informed of their complaints,

<!-- page 21 -->

wrote to his nephews, rebuking their opposition in a
letter, preserved amid the family archives.</p>

<p>"Learn," said he, "to bow with deference and respect to
the wishes of your father: Providence has ever its secret
intentions, unfathomable to the eyes of men. Often the
fortune and exaltation of a house proceed from causes opposed
to the desires of our short-sighted wisdom." It might have
been said, that this uncle, gifted with prophecy, foresaw in the
child still unborn, the lasting glory of their name.</p>

<p>The first offspring of this marriage was Francis F&eacute;nelon,
Archbishop of Cambray. The son of an old father and a
youthful mother, he was endowed by nature with the mature
wisdom of the one and the graces of the other. Cherished in
the paternal mansion, like a late and delicate fruit, till the age
of twelve years, he was brought up beneath the eyes of his
parents. As he grew to maturity, the clear sense of his father
and the sweet tenderness of his mother reappeared in his mind,
his conduct, and his writings.</p>

<p>Under a domestic preceptor the first food offered to his
imagination was the study of sacred literature, with the Greek
and Latin classics. His heart and reason, thus modelled
upon all that was good and beautiful in antiquity, naturally
took a noble form and coloring. It may be said that though
this child was born in France during the seventeenth century,
his genius was conceived at Athens in the age of Pericles.
His education was finished at the University of Cahors. The
fame of his brilliant qualities, resounding from the precincts of
his school, reached the ears of Antoine de F&eacute;nelon, the same
uncle who had proved so true an augur before the infant's
birth. This relative, having now attained a high rank in the
way, invited his nephew to join him in Paris. The youth
was destined to the priesthood, being looked upon as a burden
on the family, which they were desirous of transferring to the
Church. His philosophical and theological studies were pursued
with increased success in the eminent schools of Paris.
His natural, versatile, and precocious genius developed itself
more brilliantly there than at Cahors, while his talents and

<!-- page 22 -->

graceful accomplishments gained the attachment of many
eminent friends. The lustre of glory and admiration, by
which the young F&eacute;nelon was surrounded, excited the apprehensions
of his venerable uncle, who hastened to withdraw his
nephew from the seductions of friendship and society, by
sending him to the seminary of St. Sulpice, where he was to
enter on his novitiate.</p>

<p>While F&eacute;nelon pursued his sacred studies, his uncle, desirous
of teaching his own son the rudiments of war, conducted him
to the siege of Candia, against the Turks. The young man
fell in the first assault, struck by a ball, and expired in his
father's arms. The old warrior returned to Paris, bringing
with him the body of his son. He now only possessed a
daughter, whom he bestowed in marriage upon the Marquis de
Montmorency-Laval, of the illustrious house bearing the same
name. The loss of his only son attached Antoine de F&eacute;nelon
still more strongly to his nephew. Good and pious himself he
desired for the young neophyte no ecclesiastical honors, but
only the reward of piety and virtue.</p>

<p>The ardent imagination of the young priest carried him to
the point of enthusiasm in his profession. He formed the
resolution of leaving the cloister, to enroll himself among the
missionaries who were endeavoring to convert Canada to
Christianity, and of consecrating his life like the first preachers
of the Gospel, to the rescue of heathen souls in the forests of
the New World. He was irresistibly attracted by the resemblance
which the devotion and self-denial of these modern
Thebaids bore to the apostles of old. His ardent imagination
from early youth, and throughout his entire existence, mingled
itself with all his dreams, and even with his virtues. Thus, one
destined to improve courts and to instruct monarchs, desired
only to civilize savages in the solitude of a desert. The
Governor of St. Sulpice, a wise and prudent man, informed M.
Antoine de F&eacute;nelon of the resolution taken by his young
pupil. The uncle remonstrated affectionately with his nephew
upon this mistaken vocation, which would extinguish in the
forests of America, a flame lighted by the Almighty to shed

<!-- page 23 -->

radiance upon an accomplished age. F&eacute;nelon was obstinate,
his family insisted, and sent him to the house of another
uncle, the Bishop of Sarlat, who solemnly forbade his embarking
upon this perilous enterprise, and commanded him to
return to St. Sulpice, to complete his novitiate, and take the
final vows of his sacred order. The young man obeyed,
became a priest, and remained in Paris, where for three years
he employed himself on Sundays and holidays in the vestry of
the Church of St. Sulpice, by instructing the children of the
poor. His uncle, the Bishop of Sarlat, summoned him to his
diocese from these humble avocations, to offer himself as representative
of the clergy of his province at the General Assembly.
The youth of F&eacute;nelon defeated his uncle's ambition, and
another ecclesiastic of high birth gained the necessary votes.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, while at Sarlat, revived his earnest desire of
becoming an errant apostle for the conversion of the heathen.
He wrote thus: "I meditate a great voyage. Greece opens to
my footsteps; Mohammedanism recoils; the Peloponnesus
becomes again free; the Church of Corinth flourishes once
more, and the voice of the Apostles is heard within her walls.
I behold myself transported to those glorious lands, where
amid sacred ruins I raise together the monuments and the
spirit of the past. I visit the Areopagus where St Paul
announced to the sages of the world 'the unknown God.'
But the profane follows the sacred, and I disdain not to descend
to the Pir&aelig;us, where Socrates formed the plan of his republic.
I shall not forget thee, O blessed Patmos, isle consecrated by
the visions of the beloved disciple! There will I kiss that
earth which bore the traces of St. John's feet; and like him
perchance I shall see heaven opened, and behold the East and
West, so long divided, once more united, and Asia, after her
long night, awake to the light of day!"</p>

<p>This letter, written to the then young Bossuet (his friend
in the beginning of life, but antagonist at the end), contained
a dream never destined to realization. The Bishop of Sarlat
appeared to consent, but turned the thoughts of his nephew
to another channel by indirect means. F&eacute;nelon, recalled to

<!-- page 24 -->

Paris by the archbishop, M. de Harlay, was nominated, despite
his youth, Superior of the new converts to Catholicism, whose
number had rapidly increased through the persecutions of
Louis the Fourteenth. F&eacute;nelon was then only twenty-seven
years of age. The austerity of his habits, the intensity of his
faith, the power of his oratory, and the stern upright bent of
his mind, already bestowed upon him the authority of age.
Living in the Abbey of Saint-Germain des Pr&eacute;s (the home of
his uncle, the Marquis Antoine de F&eacute;nelon, who had retired to
the shade of the cloister); aided by the experience of the Superior
of St. Sulpice, M. Tronson; encouraged by Bossuet, his
rival and friend; holding intercourse with the rigid Duke de
Beauvilliers, and the most austere intimates of Louis the Fourteenth;
his society sought by the Archbishop of Paris, who
beheld in this young ecclesiastic an ornament to his diocese;&mdash;F&eacute;nelon
governed the order committed to him with premature
and consummate wisdom. Beneath the auspices of M. de
Harlay, he might rapidly have aspired to the highest dignities
of the Church; but he rather preferred the then sterile friendship
of Bossuet, the pursuits of science, and the acquirement
of theological eloquence. Instead of cultivating the favor of
M. de Harlay, he became the disciple of Bossuet, estimating
fame beyond preferment. M. de Harlay became jealous of
Bossuet, and resented this negligence on the part of the young
priest. "Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;," said he to him one day, after complaining
of the little desire exhibited by F&eacute;nelon to please him,
"you wish to be forgotten, and you shall be so!"</p>

<p>In truth, F&eacute;nelon was passed over in the distribution of
Church preferment. His uncle, the Bishop of Sarlat, was
compelled, in order to support his nephew in Paris, to bestow
upon him the small living of Car&eacute;nac, which belonged to his
own diocese. A revenue of 3000 francs, which barely sufficed
for the necessities of an ascetic life, constituted the sole income
possessed by F&eacute;nelon until he had reached the age of forty-two.
He passed some weeks in this rural priory, and distributed
to the surrounding poor all that he could retrench from
his own moderate expenses. He there composed verses which

<!-- page 25 -->

prove that the contemplation of nature increased his veneration
for that Mighty Creator whose presence filled his solitude. Like
many great spirits of all ages,&mdash;Solon, C&aelig;sar, Cicero, Montesquieu,
J. J. Rousseau, Chateaubriand,&mdash;he sang before he
thought. In man, the music of numbers is the forerunner of
eloquence, as the emotions of the heart ever precede the exercise
of the reasoning faculties. F&eacute;nelon's verses have all the
tenderness and grace of youth, but do not display that vigor
of a truly poetic soul which surmounts, at the first step, all the
difficulties of metrical composition, and creates, with the same
effort, sentiment, word, and verse. He felt this himself, and
after one or two attempts, resigned poetry to Racine, the Virgil
of France. He next essayed prose, which he found a less
laborious, less perfect, but a more complaisant instrument of
thought, and did not cease to be the greatest poetical genius
of his age.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon once more returned to Paris, and resumed for ten
years the direction of the establishment which had been committed
to his care, nourishing and ripening in the shade, talents
and virtues which were soon to be unveiled. He prepared
himself by speaking and writing upon sacred subjects, and
composed for the Duchess of Beauvilliers, the mother of a
young and numerous family, a treatise upon the education of
daughters. This work is far superior to the "Emile" of J. J.
Rousseau: it displays no Utopian dream, but points out a
practical and reasonable mode of education, suited to the
epoch at which F&eacute;nelon wrote. We see at once that the author
writes not for fame, but for the true benefit of his fellow-beings.
The labors and duties of his profession were lightened
by a correspondence full of pious ardor and chastened happiness,
which he carried on with his most intimate friends, of
whom he now possessed an extensive circle; but the dearest
and most constant of all was the young Abb&eacute; de Langeron,
whose memory is well worthy of being associated with that of
F&eacute;nelon. Bossuet was more than a friend: he was a preceptor
also; but a master beloved as much as he was admired. This
great man, then in his full vigor, and endowed with the authority

<!-- page 26 -->

which had increased with years, possessed at Germigny
near Paris, a country house, where he enjoyed ease and relaxation
from his labors.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, the Abb&eacute; Fleury, the Abb&eacute; Langeron, and other
chosen luminaries of the Church and of sacred literature, were
admitted to the retreat of Bossuet. They there shared his severe
leisure, listened in confidence to his sermons, his funeral
orations, and his polemic discourses. They submitted to him
their own essays, and enriched their minds by familiar intercourse
with that exalted spirit, who was more sublime in private
than in his pulpit, simply because he was more natural.
The association of such intellects ripened the ideas, enlarged
the views, polished the style, and cemented the affections. As
the river of knowledge had flowed through ancient Rome, so
had a flood of genius, philosophy, and piety rolled into Germigny,
with this difference, that the latter was superior, both
in its men and their objects. Thus passed the happiest years
of the life of F&eacute;nelon, in the enjoyments of friendship and retirement.
In this retreat, his fame attracted neither the applause
nor the envy of the world. His own renown had merged
in the reputation of Bossuet, and his personal ambition in the
friendship of these illustrious men. His genius became the
sweeter to himself from being displayed only in private. How
little did F&eacute;nelon imagine that the thunderbolt was soon to
burst on him from this cherished banqueting hall, where hitherto
he had breathed only peace, retirement, and happiness!</p>

<p>Religious warfare had scarcely been quelled in France, when
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes struck a fatal blow at
liberty of conscience, by violating the treaty between opposing
creeds, solemnly accorded by Henry the Fourth. Three hundred
thousand families were expelled, deprived of their children,
and their property confiscated. Millions of others, in the
Protestant provinces, were placed under constraint. Some
were persuaded, others compelled by force, to renounce the
religion of their fathers, and adopt that of the State. Bossuet
approved of these internal crusades against the Reformation.
In his eyes the end sanctified the means. Missionaries, supported

<!-- page 27 -->

by troops and officers of the law, scoured the provinces
compelling faith, converting the weak, strengthening the doubtful,
and punishing the obstinate. That part of the kingdom
where Protestantism had taken the deepest root, presented only
the appearance of a vast battle-field after the victory, where
ambulatory ecclesiastics, armed with the tongue and the
sword, brought back all by zeal, by seduction, or by terror,
into unity of faith. This was the work of Louis the Fourteenth,
now become old and fanatical. He thought to gain
heaven himself, by offering to the Church this vast spoil of
souls, crushed and terrified under his authority. Bossuet was
the private counsellor of this government, so absolute in the
disposal of consciences. Uniting in himself the double character
of a controversial priest and a statesman, he served with
his whole heart and soul the Church for the king, and the
king for the Church. His vast ambition, which he concealed
from himself beneath the cloak of pious zeal, induced him to
maintain an equal balance between the court of Rome and the
pride of Louis the Fourteenth; swaying skilfully the alternate
favor of these two powers, who mutually served while they
feared each other. In the name of the king he reduced Protestant
France to Catholicism; but claimed in return from this
French Catholicism, some temporal advantages and immunities
for the king, almost verging upon the point of schism. A
zealous, yet haughty servant, Bossuet commanded Rome by his
services to the Church, Versailles by his ascendency at Rome,
and the world by the sublimity of his genius. Without the
title, he possessed all the patriarchal power in France. The
Court feared while it respected him. Madame de Maintenon,
though forbearing to gratify the ambition of Bossuet (who
aspired to the Archbishopric of Paris and the Cardinal's hat,
but who, if raised to such an exalted position, might become
too absolute, and possibly unmanageable), guided, in him, the
oracle of the Church and the keeper of the king's conscience.
She who had been torn from her cradle by the persecutions of
the reformed faith (which her family professed), sought now,
with all her influence, to imbue Louis with the same cruel spirit

<!-- page 28 -->

of intolerance. The authority of Heaven and that of the king
united, sanctified, in her estimation and in the opinion of the
Court, any severities used for the conversion of the multitude.
A persecution, the horrors of which two centuries have been
powerless to efface from the memory of the provinces, ravaged
a portion of Languedoc and Vivarais. This excess of cruelty
called aloud for vengeance. The cry of their victims became
embarrassing to the Court, who sought to silence them, not
by restoring to the sufferers liberty of conscience, but by bestowing
upon them more insinuating and humane ministers.</p>

<p>Bossuet cast his eyes upon F&eacute;nelon. No man was so capable
of reassuring the terror-stricken people, of making the
yoke imposed upon them appear light and easy, and of restoring
amnesty of conscience in the provinces where persecution
and preaching had so discreditably contended. At the first
presentation of F&eacute;nelon to Louis the Fourteenth, by Bossuet,
the sole favor he demanded of the king was, to disarm religion
of all coercive power; to release Protestants from the
terrors which petrified their souls, and to allow them once
more to breathe; to banish troops from the provinces he was
about to visit; and to let persuasion, charity, and mercy alone
operate upon the minds he desired rather to enlighten than to
subdue. Louis, who looked only to the end, cared little for
the means that were adopted. He was charmed with the
grace, modesty, and eloquence of the young ecclesiastic, and
at once bestowed upon him the mission of Poitou. In this
work F&eacute;nelon was aided by his two friends, the Abb&eacute; de
Langeron and the Abb&eacute; Fleury, both of whom were animated
by his own spirit. His presence, his mildness, and his preaching
in the country, soothed turbulent spirits, and gained numerous
recantations. He allowed neither the king nor Bossuet
to credit the sincerity of the forced abjurations which had
preceded his ministry, and which had imposed a political faith
upon these provinces. In his correspondence with the Court,
he courageously upheld the right and dignity of conviction.
When accused by the advocates of persecution, of a lenity
which allowed freedom of belief to all, F&eacute;nelon wrote thus to

<!-- page 29 -->

Bossuet: "If they desire the people to abjure Christianity
and to adopt the Koran, they need but to send them a troop
of dragoons." Such language addressed to Bossuet himself
by a young minister aspiring to the dignities of his order,
proved that he was at least two centuries in advance of his
time.</p>

<p>"Continue," wrote he again to the king's ministers, "to
supply corn; you cannot adopt a more persuasive controversy.
The people are only to be gained through conviction. Let
them find as much advantage in remaining at home as peril in
leaving the kingdom." Nevertheless, we discover with regret
at a later period, in F&eacute;nelon's letters to Bossuet, some traces
of weak concession to the merciless zeal of the pontiff, and a
timid acquiescence in forcing people to heaven through the
royal authority. It must be remembered, that no man escapes
entirely from the prevailing opinions of his time; least of all
one who belongs to a body which trains its members in the
sentiments and passions of an epoch.</p>

<p>Upon his return from Poitou, F&eacute;nelon was recommended to
Louis the Fourteenth, by the Duke de Beauvilliers, and Madame
de Maintenon, as an eligible preceptor for the Duke of
Burgundy, the king's grandson. The Duke de Beauvilliers
held the office of governor to the youthful heir to the throne.
The choice reflected equal honor upon the king, the governor,
and Madame de Maintenon. F&eacute;nelon seemed predestined by
nature for this duty. His mind was essentially royal, and it
needed but to transfuse his own spirit into that of the child
born to a throne, to render him an accomplished monarch and
the pastor of his people in the most ancient acceptation of the
title. F&eacute;nelon never courted this elevation. Fortune herself
had found him in the twilight where he sought concealment.
His associates rejoiced for him, but mourned for themselves;
the Court was about to deprive them of his society. When
Bossuet heard of this appointment, respecting which he had
certainly been consulted, he expressed his pleasure in a short
letter to Madame de Montmorency-Laval, the cousin and friend
of F&eacute;nelon.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>"Yesterday, Madame," he wrote, "I was occupied with the
cares of Church and State. To-day I have leisure to think of
your happiness, in which I warmly participate. Your father
(the Marquis Antoine de F&eacute;nelon), my kind and good friend,
is with me in spirit. My imagination pictures his feelings
upon this occasion&mdash;could he witness the public exaltation of
a merit which sought so carefully to conceal itself. Do not
think, Madame, that we lose our friend. You can still enjoy
his intercourse, and I, though forced by my duties to quit
Paris, can sometimes return and embrace him."</p>

<p>In this note the whole character of the man is displayed.
The joy, untainted with envy, of a master who beholds his
own triumph in that of his pupil; the memory of an old
friendship with the head of the family which refills his heart
and would open the tomb to congratulate the dead; and the
manly tenderness of a father who in his old age sometimes
needs the presence of his son. Bossuet's heart was, at times,
hardened by controversy and inflated by pontifical authority,
but naturally it was tender. Devoid of this sensibility, he
would have been a mere rhetorician, but how could he have
possessed true eloquence? whence would have proceeded those
accents which, penetrating the souls of men, drew from them
cries and tears?</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon's other friend, the Abb&eacute; Tronson, Director of St.
Sulpice, and his spiritual adviser, addressed him in a long congratulatory
letter, anxious and affectionate, one in which joy
and fear were mingled. "The portals of earthly grandeur are
opened to you," said this holy man, "but beware lest they shut
out the more solid greatness of heaven. Your friends, doubtless, felicitate
you with the assurance of this post having been
bestowed unsought, and this is truly a source of consolation;
but do not plume yourself too highly upon it, we have often
more to do with our own elevation than we like to believe.
Unknown to ourselves we assist in removing obstacles. We
do not absolutely court those who can serve us, but we willingly
display ourselves to them in the most favorable point of
view. It is to these natural revealings, in which we suffer our

<!-- page 31 -->

merit to appear, that may be attributed the commencement of
promotion. Thus no man can say he has not contributed to
elevate himself."</p>

<p>It is easy to be seen, that the scrupulous director of the
conscience knew the secrets of his disciple's heart, and warned
him against an ambition, created by the gift and desire of pleasing,
which formed at once the charm and danger of F&eacute;nelon.</p>

<p>The first thoughts of F&eacute;nelon upon attaining his new honors,
were directed to friendship. He appointed the Abb&eacute;
Fleury, and the Abb&eacute; de Beaumont (his nephew), sub-preceptors
to the young prince; and to the Abb&eacute; de Langeron he
assigned the office of reader. Thus he concentrated all his
affections in his employment, and multiplied around his pupil
the same spirit under different names. The Duke de Beauvilliers,
his first patrol, and on whom the management of the
young prince depended, left his uncontrolled education to F&eacute;nelon,
and retained merely the title of his appointment. Equally
delicate and important were the duties of that office which
comprised in the destiny of this child, confided to F&eacute;nelon, the
future fate of a nation.</p>

<p>It is difficult at this remote period, when the overthrow of
thrones and manners have still further increased the distance,
to comprehend thoroughly the court of Louis the Fourteenth.
It represented a sort of Christian monarchy of Olympus, in
which the king was the Jupiter, around whom revolved inferior
gods and goddesses, deified by the adulation of the great
and the superstition of the ignorant. Their virtues and their
vices were alike extravagantly displayed with an audacious superiority
that seemed to place between the people and the
throne, the difference exhibited in the moral system of the gods
as opposed to the moral system of men. Louis the Fourteenth
was looked upon as an exception to every thing, even to humanity
itself. This king was not judged like other sublunary
beings; he seemed to have a conscience, a virtue, a God, apart
from the rest of mortals. It was a unique period in the history
of the greatness of courts, the intoxication of courtiers, and
the prostration of the people.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>The lustre of the throne proceeded less from the sovereign
who reigned, than from the events which that reign brought
forth. Complete and absolute sovereignty was ripe at this
epoch, and Louis had but to gather the fruit. Of two great
ministers, Richelieu and Mazarin, the former had aided despotism
by abating the power of the nobles; the latter had obtained
peace and obedience by lightening the yoke of the
oppressed people, by winning the parliaments, by purifying
factions, by seducing the Court, by corrupting princes, and by
placing, through the power of his <i>smooth Machiavelism</i>, France,
vanquished, bought, pardoned, and wearied, within the hands
of a child. The energetic and dominant nature of the Gaul
displayed by Richelieu, the Greek and Italian finesse of Mazarin,
seemed to have been created in concert for the purpose of
moulding the kingdom to servitude and tranquillity.</p>

<p>The entire reign of Louis the Fourteenth is contained in the
lives of these two men: the one the terror, the other the attraction
of royalty. Richelieu has been fully appreciated, and,
it may be, somewhat too highly lauded; but history has not
yet accorded to Mazarin his just meed. He was the Machiavel,
unspotted with crime, of the French monarchy. After his
death, Louis the Fourteenth had neither to struggle for power
nor respect; he was only called upon to reign.</p>

<p>Owing to these two antecedents, he was not required to be
a great man in order to become a great king.</p>

<p>It was sufficient to possess an exalted heart with an upright
mind, and both dwelt in Louis. His intellect was enlightened,
not by genius, but by good sense. His heart was elevated, not
by grandeur of soul, but by pride. Mazarin had taught him
to despise men, and to believe in the divine character of his
power. He did so believe, and therein lay his strength. The
idolatry he bore towards himself served as an example for that
incense which he expected to breathe, and commanded in his
Court. He had well learnt from his first minister, the most
penetrating of statesmen, to discern the true value of men. To
reign well, for Louis the Fourteenth, was but to be served
well.  He seldom made a mistake in his selections for office.

<!-- page 33 -->

His kingdom represented nothing more than his house, the
ministers his domestics, the State his family; in fact, the
government was but a reflection of his own individual
character.</p>

<p>This character, embellished upon the surface by a remnant
of the chivalry of the race of Valois, which adorned egotism
in the monarch and servility in his Court, possessed nothing
great beyond its personality. He thought only of himself; he
was born a master, he well understood the art of command, he
was polished in manners, steady in all political relations,
faithful to those who served him, capable of appreciating
merit, and desirous of absorbing in what he considered his
own glory, the fame of all who were renowned either for
great virtue or great talent. Troubles of long continuance
were appeased, civil wars extinguished, peace established, and
literature revived: nature, ever more productive after storms,
assigned to this reign the date of French genius in literature
and art. Louis, like a fortunate man, and one worthy of his
fate, seized the advantages of his time, which he stimulated
and encouraged by his munificence and condescension. He
claimed every rising genius as a new subject.</p>

<p>With regard to religion, he professed two faiths,&mdash;the one
exclusively political, which consisted in fulfilling literally, by
force if necessary, his part of most Christian king, crowned
son and lictor of the Church; the other was altogether private,
an inheritance from his mother, brought from Spain,&mdash;scrupulous
in conscience, literal in practice, and superstitious
in creed. Such a piety as this, up to advanced age, exercised
but little influence over his conduct; it had no true elevation,
no independence of soul, no sublime view of the
Creator. It was more that of a slave who trembles, than of a
king who prays. He accommodated it to all his inclinations,
and profaned it by his many weaknesses. Devoted to love
more by the senses than the intellect, his intrigues were numerous;
nevertheless, they partook but little of a libertine
character. A certain sincerity of admiration, and constancy
of regard, invested them with comparative purity. It was less

<!-- page 34 -->

vice than passion; but such an oriental passion resembled
more the attachment of a sultan to his favorite, than the devotion
of a lover to his idol. He flattered, he adored, he insisted
upon the Court, the army, and the people, worshipping
the object of his fancy, which he soon crushed to exalt another.
Thus he lived, environing his wife with his mistresses, and
never thinking himself sufficiently adored unless his weaknesses
were included in the worship. At length came maturity, and
remorse succeeded to voluptuousness. He sought to reconcile
the necessity of a favorite with the demands of devotion. A
woman formed expressly by nature and art to fill such a position,
attracted his regard; he cultivated her society, but when
he sought to conquer, found he could do so only by marrying
her.  This woman was Madame de Maintenon.</p>

<p>At the period when F&eacute;nelon was summoned to the Court,
Madame de Maintenon had reigned for several years. Her
destiny was less the result of a fortunate chance, than of an
ably-studied calculation. Thus crafty though virtuous women
make respect an auxiliary of intrigue, and adopt this eminent
example as the saint and patron of ambition. Men do not
sympathize with her, as passion held no sway in her capitulation
with the king. If she negotiated for a long time, it was
but to sell herself at the highest price to a man whom she had
never loved.</p>

<p>Descended from a family persecuted and ruined for their
attachment to Protestantism, brought as a child from the
colonies by a relation without a home, increasing with years
in all those charms which expose a young girl so early to
temptation, inspiring those who beheld her with an admiration
increased by her misfortunes, educated amid the usages of an
equivocal society, living in domestic familiarity with the most
celebrated courtezan of the time, Ninon de l'Enclos, marrying
finally the old, infirm, and burlesque poet, Scarron, her chaste
and melancholy beauty contrasting with the age and ill-temper
of her husband, her poverty so nobly endured, her strict and
irreproachable conduct amid surrounding license and seductions,
the severe graces of her mind cultivated in the shade, a

<!-- page 35 -->

cheerful yet sincere piety, which formed at once the safeguard
of her youth and the foundation of that respect which the
world entertained for her;&mdash;all these combining causes
attracted towards her the attention of those who came from
the Court to relax themselves at the house of the Diogenes of
the day. Having soon become the widow of Scarron, during
the period of mourning she concealed herself in a convent
from the injurious remarks of the world. Compelled to supplicate
for the small pension to which she was entitled, as surviving
her husband, she approached the Court, where she
formed various connections, when a fortunate opportunity
occurred. A sure and devoted confidante was required, to
whom could be confided the Duke du Maine, the invalid child
of Madame de Montespan. Upon the presentation of the
young widow to the favorite, the latter became fascinated at
once, and Madame de Maintenon received the young prince
from the hands of the king and his mistress. She conducted
him to the baths of the Pyrenees, in order to re-establish his
health, and commence his education. The correspondence
she was obliged to carry on from thence with Madame de
Montespan and the king, dissipated any prejudice Louis had
formed against her. She gained his confidence and won his
interest. No woman of her time, or perhaps of any other, wrote
in a style so simple, varied, and forcible: her pen displayed
the solidity of her judgment, and the capability of her mind.
Good sense, clearness, and force were her muses; these were
the qualities which accorded well with the rigid and precise
spirit of Louis the Fourteenth, and were at the same time those
which the favorite least dreaded in a confidante. The superiority
of her own imagination, the brightness of her sallies, her
strength of passion, the sparkling flow of her conversation,
secured her from all rivalry. She possessed genius and the
arts of seduction, and looked without alarm upon a simple
esteem.</p>

<p>It was beneath the mask of this modest temperament and
this humble assumption of the part of confidante, that the
widow insinuated herself more and more into the friendship of

<!-- page 36 -->

the favorite and the intimacy of the king. This accordance
with a <i>liaison</i> which scandalized all Europe, demanded concessions
from the virtue of the confidante which were scarcely
compatible with the rigor of her piety. But we have already
said that the king was an exception to the recognized rules of
morality. The new friend of Madame de Montespan and of
the monarch satisfied her conscience by blaming, in gentle
words, a guilty intercourse which she sanctioned by her actions.
Her complaisance never extended absolutely to approbation or
connivance, and in the interviews which her charge and her
residence in the house of the favorite rendered frequent with
the sovereign, she reproached him for his weakness, and urged
him to repentance. Her ripened beauty, preserved in all its
freshness by the coldness of her temperament, had at least as
much effect in the king's conversion as the sternness of her
language. When at length liberated by the death of the
queen, he asked himself if a calm, sincere, and virtuous
attachment to a woman at the same time attractive and sensible,
would not offer to his mind and his senses a felicity as
superior as it would exceed in virtue the voluptuous love of
nis unreformed years. The charm augmented with every
interview, and the jealousy and angry reproaches of Madame
de Montespan served only to increase it. She accused the
friend whom she had raised from so low a condition, of ingratitude
and domestic treachery, and declared she had but availed
herself of her intimacy to suborn the heart of the king by
pious seductions, and to gain the place of Esther in the royal
bed, from whence she should be driven with opprobrium and
infamy.</p>

<p>The predictions of despairing love were fulfilled; the accusation
of ingratitude proved only too just. Before many years
had elapsed, Madame de Montespan was disgraced, and dragged
out her sorrowing existence in exile, while the widow of
Scarron became queen. Still, the dignity of the throne and
the pride of the monarch prevailed sufficiently over his love
to prevent the public announcement of his slavery to this new
wife. He was contented to satisfy the demands of the Church

<!-- page 37 -->

by obtaining the benediction of the Archbishop of Paris on
the night of his marriage, in presence of a few trusty courtiers.
The ceremony was secret, but the connection public. Madame
de Maintenon occupied in the people's eyes, the equivocal
position of the king's revered favorite. The royal family, the
court, the ministers, the clergy, the sovereign himself, all
became subservient to her influence. Favorite, wife, arbitress
of the Church, oracle of the council, she was at the same time
the Richelieu and the Mazarin of the king's old age. Her
clever humility bowed in outward appearance to the royal
authority, and while her will became the king's law, she ever
induced him to draw forth her opinions as if by compulsion.
It was as if a monarch had espoused his prime minister.</p>

<p>Piety, which had succeeded to love, formed the lasting bond
of this union. The Court, inspired by the example of a
religious woman,&mdash;governed by a master alarmed for his salvation,&mdash;domineered
over by such stern bishops as Bossuet,&mdash;reprimanded
by confessors, sometimes terrible as Letellier, at
others, gentle as Lachaise,&mdash;agitated by opposing factions,&mdash;divided
between ambition and mysticism,&mdash;resembled more a
synod than a government. Versailles at that period recalls to
mind the palace of the Blacquernal at Byzantium, under the
sway of the Greek rulers of the Lower Empire; where metaphysical
quarrels distracted the Court and the people, and left
Constantinople open to the advance of destruction and the
legions of her conquerors.</p>

<p>The king had a son who bore the title of Monseigneur.
This prince, who had been educated by Bossuet and Montausier,
was gifted by nature with courage and intelligence; but
the Eastern jealousy of Louis withdrew him from the camp the
moment he displayed ability, and banished him to Meudon,
where he resided, with a single companion, almost in a state
of indigence. The son ultimately consented to occupy this
obscure position in order to remove from Louis the insupportable
presence of an heir to the throne. The king trembled
less before the shadow of death, than before the knowledge
that one day he must cease to reign. The Duke of Burgundy,

<!-- page 38 -->

the guidance of whose studies had been confided to F&eacute;nelon,
was the son of Monseigneur, and grandson of the king, who,
following the custom of grandfathers, preferred this child to
his own son. His extreme youth removed all unpleasant feelings,
as the great disparity of years placed a wide distance
between the monarch's reign and that of this youthful successor.</p>

<p>Some of the courtiers attached themselves to these different
branches of the royal family. The greater number surrounded
the king, and all paid homage to Madame de Maintenon.</p>

<p>Such was the Court of France when F&eacute;nelon entered upon
his functions as preceptor to the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The disposition of this child inspired more fear than hope.
"He was terrible from his birth," said St. Simon, the untaught
but impressive Tacitus of the end of this reign. "In his earliest
years he caused those about him to tremble; unfeeling,
displaying the most violent passion, which extended towards
inanimate objects, incapable of bearing the slightest contradiction,
even from the hours or the elements, without giving way
to a whirlwind of rage sufficient to break all the blood-vessels
in his body&mdash;I speak of what I have often witnessed: opinionated
to excess; absorbed in the pursuits of pleasure, fond of
good living, following the chase with furious impetuosity,
enjoying music with a sort of delirium, madly attached to
play, but unable to bear loss, and when defeated, becoming
positively dangerous; in fact, abandoned to all the evil passions,
and transported by every corrupting pleasure; often
savage, naturally cruel; bitter in raillery, ridiculing with a
remorseless power, regarding all men (irrespective of merit),
from his high position, but as atoms with whom he could have
no affinity. Wit and powers of penetration shone through all
he did or said, even in his paroxysms of extreme violence.
His repartees were marvellous, his replies always just and
profound. He but glanced superficially at the most abstruse
points of learning; the extent and vivacity of his powers were
so varied that they prevented his fixing upon any distinct
branch of knowledge, and almost rendered him incapable of

<!-- page 39 -->

study. From this abyss came forth a prince," &amp;c. This
prince was the child confided to F&eacute;nelon to remodel.</p>

<p>The king, Madame de Maintenon, and the Duke de Beauvillier
had peen admirably guided, either by chance or discernment,
in the selection of such a master for such a disciple.
F&eacute;nelon had been endowed by nature with the two attributes
most requisite in those who teach&mdash;the power of command
and the gift of pleasing. Dignity and fascination emanated
from his whole being,&mdash;nature had traced in his lineaments
the beauty of his soul. His countenance expressed his genius
even in moments of silence. The pencil, the chisel, and the
pen of his cotemporaries, some of whom were his enemies, all
agree in their delineation of F&eacute;nelon. D'Aguesseau and St.
Simon have been his Vandyck and his Rubens. He lives, he
speaks, and enchants in their hands.</p>

<p>His figure was tall, elegant, and flexible in its proportions
as that of Cicero. Nobility and modesty reigned in his air
and governed his motions; the delicacy and paleness of his
features added to their perfection. He borrowed none of his
beauty from the carnation, owed none of it to color; it consisted
entirely in the purity and grace of outline, and was
altogether of a moral and intellectual cast. In moulding his
expression, nature had employed but little physical material.
We feel while contemplating this countenance, that the rare
and delicate elements of which it was composed, afforded no
home to the more brutal and sensual passions. They were
shaped and moulded only to display a quick intelligence, and
to render the soul visible. His forehead was lofty, oval,
rounded in the centre, depressed and throbbing towards the
temples; surmounted by fine hair of an undecided color,
which the involuntary breath of inspiration agitated like a
gentle wind, as it curled around the cap that covered the top
of his head. His eyes, of a liquid transparency, received, like
water, the various reflections of light and shadow, thought and
impression. It was said that their color reflected the texture
of his mind. Eyebrows arched, round, and delicate, relieved
them; long, veined, and transparent lids covered and unveiled

<!-- page 40 -->

them alternately with a rapid movement. His aquiline nose
was marked by a slight prominence, which gave energy of
expression to a profile more Greek than Roman. His mouth,
the lips of which were partly unclosed, like those of a man
who breathes from an open heart, had an expression, wavering
between melancholy and playfulness, which revealed the freedom
of a spirit controlled by the gravity of the thoughts. It
seemed to incline equally to prayer or to smiles, and breathed
at the same time of heaven and earth. Eloquence or familiar
conversation flowed spontaneously from every fold; the cheeks
were depressed, but unwrinkled, save at the two corners of the
mouth, where benevolence had indented lines expressive of
habitual graciousness. His chin, firm and somewhat prominent,
gave a manly solidity to a countenance otherwise approaching
to the feminine. His voice corresponded, in its
sweet, grave, and winning resonance, with all the harmonious
traits of his countenance. The tone conveyed as much as the
words, and moved the listeners before the meaning was conveyed
to them.</p>

<p>"This exterior," continues D'Aguesseau, "was rendered
more imposing by a lustre of distinction which spread around
his person, and by an indescribable expression, at once sublime
and simple, which impressed upon his character and his
features an almost prophetic air. Without effort he gave a
new turn to all his conceptions, which made his hearers fancy
that inspiration had rendered him master of every science,
and that instead of acquiring he had invented them. He was
always new, ever original, imitating none, and himself inimitable.
The theatre in which he performed was not too great for
so great an actor; he held no place there but that assigned to
him by the public, and his position was worthy of his genius."</p>

<p>To these endowments of nature, F&eacute;nelon added all those
which are bestowed by a natural power of pleasing, without an
effort to beguile or flatter. The desire of being loved as he
himself loved, was his sole art of flattery and seduction; but
in this also lay all his power. "This power," said his friends,
"became an irresistible fascination, in proportion as it was

<!-- page 41 -->

involuntary." This ardent inclination to please was no effort
of his mind, it was simply his good fortune. Drawn towards
all by his love, he drew all in turn to himself. Benevolence
was so completely his essence, that in breathing he imparted it
to others. The universal regard which he met with, was but
the rebound of that affection he displayed towards his fellow
creatures. This desire to please was no artifice; it was
spontaneous emotion. He did not, like the ambitious, exert it
only where interest beckoned, towards those who by their
friendship could aid his advancement or his schemes; it extended
to all, without other distinction than deference to the
great and condescension to the humble. Equally anxious, said
St. Simon, to delight his superiors, his equals, and his inferiors,
in this desire of reciprocal love he recognized no distinctions of
great and small, high or low; he sought only to conquer
hearts with his own; he neglected none, and noticed even the
humblest domestics of the palace: nevertheless, this prodigality
of regard had nothing vulgar or uniform in its expression
which might have vulgarized or deteriorated its value. It was
marked, distinctive, and proportioned, not in tenderness, but in
familiarity of manner, according to the rank, the worth, and
the degree of the individual. To some respectfully affectionate,
to others displaying ardent friendship; giving a smile
here, and a word there;&mdash;a kindly glance, a natural benevolence,
spontaneously governed all his motions: his guide was
sentiment, not form. A faultless tact (that instinct of the
mind) involuntarily prevented his evincing too much consideration
for one person, or too little for another. The measure
bestowed on each was correctly proportioned. To all other
charms, he joined a marvellous grace,&mdash;a grace the gift of
nature, and to which good taste was added by gentle birth.
Born within the ranks of the aristocracy, educated amid the
distinguished, accustomed from infancy to move in a sphere
above the crowd, his manners bore that undeniable stamp of
superiority which raises by its condescension, and flatters by
its love, his politeness never seemed an attention to all, but
a peculiar notice bestowed on each; it imparted its own character

<!-- page 42 -->

to his genius. He never sought to dazzle by display
those who might have felt obscured or humiliated under the
ascendency of his talents. He suited his discourse to the
capacity of his associates, equalling always, but never trying to
surpass them. The conversation which forms the true eloquence
of friendship was supereminently his. Ever adapted
to the man, the hour, and the subject, it was grave, flexible,
luminous, sublime, or playful, but always noble and instructive.
In his most unstudied flights there was something sweet, kind,
and winning, which the most humble comprehended, and
which compelled them to pardon his superiority. None, continues
St. Simon (who dreaded his genius), could leave, or
deprive themselves of the charm of his society, without wishing
to return to it again. His conversation left that impression
on the soul which his voice left on the ear, and his
features on the eyes,&mdash;a new, powerful, and indelible stamp,
which could never be effaced, either from the mind, the senses,
or the heart. Some men have been greater; none have been
more adapted to humanity; and none have swayed more by
the power of the affections.</p>

<p>Such was F&eacute;nelon, when he appeared at Court, in his forty-second
year. He speedily obtained dominion over all except
only the envious, who could not endure superiority, and the
king, who, in opposition to genius, possessed only the gift of
plain common sense, and could not endure that any other than
himself should be an object of general regard. Madame de
Maintenon, a woman of truly superior discernment wherever
ambition did not obscure her faculties, recognized at once in
F&eacute;nelon the dominating mind of this secondary Court which
surrounded the heir to the throne. His gentle, pure, and
sincere piety, prevented any danger from the universal influence
he exercised. She drew him into intimacy, and even
wished to render him the confidant of her thoughts, in choosing
him for her spiritual director. Such a confidence would
have rendered the will of F&eacute;nelon the arbiter of the will of
Madame de Maintenon, who herself ruled the disposition of
the king.  The oratory of a female would have become the

<!-- page 43 -->

oracle of an age. It is believed that the comparative youth of
F&eacute;nelon, and the instinctive repugnance of the monarch to
such an alarming superiority, deterred her from the fulfilment
of this intention. She confided her conscience to another, but
still bestowed all her favors upon F&eacute;nelon. No mind in the
Court so quickly understood, admired, and loved him. With
the exception of Bossuet, all connected with the pious intercourse
of Louis the Fourteenth and Madame de Maintenon,
were persons of middling capacity. The genius of F&eacute;nelon
soared far above this circle; but we have already said that
no man could so well adapt himself to those whom he could
never raise to his own height. The greatest triumph of his
genius consisted in forgetting itself.</p>

<p>He confined himself, under the patronage of the Duke de
Beauvillier, and the intimacy of the Duke de Chevreuse, both
rather his friends than his superiors, to the delicate functions
of his charge: the recital of those endeavors and successes by
which the master achieved the transformation of his pupil
belong rather to the studies of philosophy than the records of
history. The first process adopted by F&eacute;nelon was the influence
of his own character. He succeeded in persuading,
because he had succeeded in making himself loved; and he
became loved, from having begun by bestowing love himself.
In a few years he had remodelled this rude nature, at first
sterile and unproductive, but afterwards ductile and fruitful,
into the Germanicus of France. This Germanicus, like he of
Rome, can only be exhibited to the world for a moment; we
shall meet him again on the borders of the grave.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of the studious leisure of this royal education,
which forced upon F&eacute;nelon's mind the contemplation
of the philosophy of societies, that he secretly composed, in a
poetical form, his moral and political code of government.
We speak of "Telemachus," which perpetuates the genius of
F&eacute;nelon to all posterity. If he had merely been the lettered
and elegant courtier of Madame le Maintenon's private circle,
the exemplary and eloquent pontiff of Cambray, the tutor of
a prince, carried off from his regal inheritance while yet under

<!-- page 44 -->

age, his name would already have been forgotten. But he has
moulded his soul and genius into an imperishable poem. His
mind is his immortal monument, and lives in this work.</p>

<p>The exact period and method adopted by the poet in the
composition of "Telemachus," have been subjects of much
discussion. Some have thought that the intentions of the
writer never destined it to assume the form of a book, and
that it was transcribed without forethought, a page at a time,
to afford introductory subjects upon Greek and Latin studies
to his pupil. The scope, the regularity, the continuity, and
sublimity of the work, evidently composed from a sustained
train of ideas, defeat these puerile suppositions. They are no
less falsified by the nature of the subjects which F&eacute;nelon discusses
in Telemachus. Can any one suppose that a sensible
instructor, a scrupulous guardian of the imagination of his
pupil, would have bestowed upon him as the subject of his
studies, and as an example of the best theories of government,
the equivocal fables of the mythology, and the soft images of
the amours of Eucharis? Such a conclusion is to calumniate
the good sense and modesty of the poet. This book, which
was in truth composed expressly for the young prince, was
evidently written with the intention of fortifying his mind,
when formed by manhood, against the doctrines of tyranny
and the snares of voluptuousness,&mdash;pictures which the master
presented to his pupil, to arm him beforehand against the
seductions of a throne, and the allurements of his own heart.
The truth of this hypothesis is, that the instructor detached
from time to time, a page of his manuscript suited to the age
and faults of the pupil, and made him translate it, with the
intention of presenting to him in his composition, either the
maxims he sought to inculcate, or the portraits of those vices
he was desirous of counteracting by indirect lessons. But the
entire poem, as a whole, formed the relaxation, the treasure
and the secret of the poet.</p>

<p>All the world are acquainted with this poem&mdash;Christian in
its inspiration, pagan in its form. This original defect corresponds
perfectly with the man and the period.  F&eacute;nelon, like

<!-- page 45 -->

his book, possessed a pagan genius and a Christian spirit. Despite
this vice of composition, which destroys the character of
co-existence and nationality,&mdash;which all truly monumental
books ought to display, if they seek to be the living and eternal
memorials of true and original thoughts,&mdash;it is the most
perfect treatise upon education and political economy that exists
in modern times: and this treatise has the unusual merit
of being, at the same time, a poem, a moral essay, and a narrative!
It bears a threefold existence: it instructs, it interests,
and it charms. It is true, it lacks the melody of verse.
F&eacute;nelon never possessed sufficient power of imagination to exercise
over his ideas that force of composition which embodies
them in rhythm, or, as we may say, blends together words and
images by throwing them into the mould of poetry. But his
prose was intrinsically poetical; and if it has not the perfection,
the cadence and harmony, it has, nevertheless, the full
charm of measured numbers. It is always music, although of
an uncertain sound, which flows softly and freely through the
ear. This poetry may be less durable, but is also less fatiguing,
than that of Homer or Virgil. If it possesses not the lasting
quality of metal, neither is it encumbered with the weight.
An ordinary comprehension can follow it with less effort. F&eacute;nelon
and Chateaubriand are poets as much through sentiment
as by the power of imagery. They possess that which forms
the essence of poetry, and makes the greatest poets. The only
distinction is, that they speak instead of singing their stanzas.
The true imperfection of this beautiful book consists not in
its being written in prose, but rather in its being a copy from
the antique, instead of a modern original. We can fancy ourselves
reading a translation from Homer, or a continuation of
the Odyssey, by a disciple equal to his master. The places,
the names, the customs, the people, the events, the images, the
fables, the deities, the men, the earth, the sea, and the heaven,&mdash;all
are Greek and pagan; there is nothing French, and nothing
Christian. The whole work is a caprice of genius&mdash;the
disguise of a modern imagination beneath the fictions and
vestments of the ancient mythology. We feel it to be a sublime

<!-- page 46 -->

imitation, but an imitation in every line. F&eacute;nelon is here,
like a second Homer, living amid another people and in another
age, singing fables to a generation who no longer believe them.
Herein lies the fault of the poem. This was also the vice of
the period, which, not having yet created its own poetry or its
own imagery, and finding itself surrounded, upon the revival
of letters, by the monuments of Greek inspiration, thought
nothing could be more beautiful than to copy these vestiges;
and thus original thought remained impotent from the force
of admiration.</p>

<p>But this error explained and excused, does not render the
work of F&eacute;nelon less sublime. It seems the dictation of filial
piety; we may almost say, that it is a poem containing every
virtuous and religious emotion belonging to man. The poet
tells us that the young Telemachus, the son of Ulysses and
Penelope, conducted by Wisdom, in the shape of an old man,
denominated Mentor, navigates the eastern seas in search of
his father, who has been driven for ten years, by the anger of
the gods, from his kingdom, the small island of Ithaca. Telemachus,
during this long voyage, sometimes auspicious, occasionally
the reverse, landing or driven upon numerous coasts,
is often present at different forms of civilization, explained to
him by his attendant guardian, Mentor. He encounters many
dangers, experiences many passions; is exposed to the snares
of pride, of glory, of voluptuousness, and triumphs over all,
through the assistance of that invisible Wisdom which counsels
and protects him. Matured by years, and instructed by
experience, he becomes an accomplished prince; and, having
encountered in the countries he has traversed, sometimes good
kings, sometimes tyrants, and occasionally republics, he reduces
the lessons which he has been taught by example, to the practical
government of his own people.</p>

<p>Like Emile, the plebeian Telemachus of J. J Rousseau, this
poem is exclusively social and political. It is at once the critic
and theorist of society and governments. It was intended to
furnish the programme of a future reign, in which the Duke
of Burgundy was to be the Telemachus, and F&eacute;nelon the Mentor.

<!-- page 47 -->

It is chiefly under this point of view that this book has
exerted such a powerful influence over the mind of man. F&eacute;nelon
was not only a poet, but also a political legislator; a modern
Solon; a living date throughout all the revolutions of
society which have agitated the world since the appearance of
his poem. We may say, without romance or exaggeration,
that all good and all evil, all that is true, all that is false, all
that is real and all that is chimerical, in the great European
revolution of opinions and institutions, of which we have been
the instruments, the spectators, and the victims, during a century,
has flowed from this book, as from the fountain of good
and evil. Telemachus is at once the grand <i>revelation</i> and
<i>Utopia</i> of all classes of society. When we follow the chain
attentively, link by link, from the most fanatic tribunes of the
Convention to the Girondins, from the Girondins to Mirabeau,
from Mirabeau to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, from Bernardin
de Saint-Pierre to J. J. Rousseau, from J. J. Rousseau to Turgot,
from Turgot to Vauban, from Vauban to the preceptor of
the Duke of Burgundy, we shall discover in F&eacute;nelon the first
revolutionist, the first tribune of the people, the first reformer
of kings, the first apostle of liberty; and in Telemachus we
shall acknowledge the evangelist of the truths and errors of
modern revolutions. The politics of F&eacute;nelon were virtuous,
but chimerical. Hence the summits and precipices upon which
this revolution rises, or down which it plunges lower and lower
at each effort to become practical. The moral principles inculcated
by Telemachus are admirable, but the ideas upon
government are absurd. In F&eacute;nelon, the political transformation
of the world possessed its prophet; but it was compelled
to wait another century for its statesman. The good sense of
Louis the Fourteenth, sharpened by the exercise of government,
taught him at once the true estimate of the man and
the book. "F&eacute;nelon," said he, "is the most chimerical individual
in my kingdom."</p>

<p>All his general maxims, healthy in theory, have been destroyed
in practice by the imperfections inseparable from humanity.
People ruled by their own wisdom; patrician and

<!-- page 48 -->

plebeian republics; royalties tempered by the sacerdotal or
popular authority; representative government; triennial assemblies
of the states-general of the nation; provincial administrations
and assemblies; the election and deposition of
princes; the sovereignty of the people in action; the suppression
of hereditary succession to the throne and magisterial
offices; liberty of conscience; perpetual peace among nations;
fraternity and equality among the citizens; the destruction
of individual wealth, under the pretext of advantage to the
community; the arbitrary dictation of the State, as to the fortunes
of its subjects; the distribution of lands and professions
by the government; public education enforcing equalizing
principles, which all the children of the kingdom were compelled
to undergo; the community of benefits; the condemnation
of luxury; the sumptuary laws, operating upon houses,
lodgings, food, and elementary trades, such as agriculture,
where the toils of the lower orders met with the strongest
incitement from the suppression of luxury and the arts; the
<i>maximum</i> of price and of consumption in provisions; a system
of political economy, by turns the best or the worst; truth,
error, Utopias, inconsistencies, contradictions, illusions, possibility,
impossibility, extended views, short-sighted systems,
dreams, undefined ideas, aspirations devoid of any solid foundation,
without aim or possibility of being reduced to action;&mdash;all
contribute to render the political code inculcated by Telemachus
merely the <i>pastoral</i> of government. All is confused:
we feel ourselves floating in an ocean of human imagination,
without compass to direct us,&mdash;tending towards neither pole,
and without a coast to land upon. It resembles the <i>Contrat
Social</i> of J. J. Rousseau, the Utopia of Plato, or that of Thomas
More; and is, in fact, a <i>Pandemonium</i> of empty speculations.
Every thing in it is a shadow, and nothing substantial. While
contemplating these four books&mdash;the Republic of Plato, the
Utopia of More, the Telemachus of F&eacute;nelon, and the Contrat
Social of J. J. Rousseau&mdash;we can repeat with conviction the
saying of Frederic the Great, "If I had an empire to punish, I
would bestow the government of it upon the philosophers."</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>These philosophers, despite the grandeur of their genius, the
elevation of their views, and the virtue of their designs, plan
systems for humanity at large which are suited only to an abstract
portion. Minds, without practical experience, construct
their imaginary institutions upon clouds, and the moment
these clouds touch the earth, their institutions melt into vapor,
or fall to ruins. F&eacute;nelon, in "Telemachus," proves himself
one of those philosophers who have created for the age which
they imagine, the most beautiful, but the most mistaken perspectives;
who equally mingle sound and unsound opinions;
and who have confounded a passion for ameliorating the condition
of humanity with a passion for attaining the impossible.
It is against such practical impossibilities that inexperienced revolution
(of which they are the parent) wounds, struggles, and
always destroys itself; and it is also from the anger created
by the resistance which reality offers to chimera that spring
the deceptions, the frenzies, the tyrannies, and the crimes of
this very spirit of change. The visionary Utopiasts, who advocate
a purely metaphysical form of government, and the
annihilation of power, produced the crimes and anarchies of
the revolution of 1793. The Utopiasts of levelling property
and social communism produced the panic, the disavowal, and
the adjournment of the revolution of 1848. These two dreams
of F&eacute;nelon have been looked upon as serious practicalities by
short-sighted reasoners. The saintly poet has unintentionally
been the first radical and the first communist of his age.</p>

<p>The influence of this book in matters of political economy,
has been no less powerful and equally fatal; but its errors in
this respect are more easily demonstrated. The declamations
against art and luxury, the sumptuary laws to regulate the
consumption of articles produced by labor, which are useless
in our epoch, were applicable to the primitive condition of
that antiquity from which F&eacute;nelon unfortunately drew his
examples and imbibed his ideas. Upon the first establishment
of any community strictly pastoral and agricultural, where the
earth is cultivated with difficulty, and scarcely supplies the
necessary aliment of man, it becomes the enforced law and

<!-- page 50 -->

virtue of citizens to consume as little as possible, that their
sobriety and abstemiousness may thus leave a larger portion
to satisfy the wants of their brethren. The aim of such laws
was to prevent scarcity, that scourge of new-born empires,
whose existence depends upon abundance of provision. Under
this view, temperance, which is now a virtue confined to ourselves,
became a benefit conferred on society. Abstinence was
an act of devotion&mdash;luxury a crime. We can thus comprehend
the usefulness of sumptuary laws in the remote periods
of antiquity; but when a community is firmly established, and
has increased its productive powers by clearing land, by the
acquisition of flocks and machinery, when it no longer fears
scarcity, and supports its immense population by the wages
paid for the various products of art, intellect, and industry;
when the luxury of one class creates the riches of another;
when each pleasure, each vanity, and each caprice of the rich,
pays, voluntarily or involuntarily, a reward for the labor
which has supplied it,&mdash;the system of F&eacute;nelon, of Plato, and of
J. J. Rousseau, appears no longer a mere absurdity, but
assumes the serious aspect of a ruinous injury to the people.
Consumption then becomes a virtue, and luxury proportioned
to fortune supplies the necessities of the rest of mankind.
This error of "Telemachus" is one of those which produced
the worst evils of the Revolution, and its impression is still
uneffaced from the minds of the people, much as it has misguided
and injured them.</p>

<p>Such is "Telemachus,"&mdash;virtuous in maxim, deplorable in
application. But as this poem responds by anticipation to the
most noble and most legitimate instincts of justice, equality,
and purity in the government of empires&mdash;as it was inspired
by a pious mind, and written by a poetical genius&mdash;we can
imagine the effect such a book was likely to produce upon
the world.</p>

<p>But "Telemachus" contained also the secret of F&eacute;nelon.
He wrote it in the palace of Louis the Fourteenth, and concealed
it from the notice of the king and the courtiers until
near the close of the reign.  In this book there was a terrible

<!-- page 51 -->

accusation, which he reserved for the period when his pupil,
the Duke of Burgundy, should have attained the years of
maturity, and have approached more closely to the throne.
It was a sealed confidence, to remain until then unbroken,
between the master and the pupil. Perhaps this book was
also destined at the moment of the young prince's accession,
to proclaim a new political system&mdash;to be, in fact, the programme
of a F&eacute;nelonian government. It was also a sort of
indirect aspiration to the post of first minister, for which F&eacute;nelon
might have felt a presentiment, without even acknowledging
it to himself. The ambition which his friend, the
Abb&eacute; Tronson, had warned him against, as we have already
seen,&mdash;that species of ambition which does not seek to aggrandize
its possessor, but which is involuntarily created and revealed
by intellectual ability,&mdash;such was that of F&eacute;nelon.
There are certain men whom nature has endowed with distinct
privileges. Their ambition, instead of being the offspring of
passion, is the emanation of mental power. They do not
aspire, but they mount by an irresistible force, as the a&euml;rostatic
globe rises above an element heavier than itself, by the
sole superiority of specific ascendency. The very goodness of
F&eacute;nelon caused him to desire some future elevation, where his
benevolent spirit could shed itself with more effect upon all
around him. But envy now began to penetrate into the
shade where he had sought concealment. People began to
be alarmed at the influence exercised by him, not only in the
capacity of master, but as a friend, over the mind of his pupil.
The increasing interest daily evinced by Madame de Maintenon
for the charms of his conversation, had a powerful influence at
Court. The correspondence between her and F&eacute;nelon was as
frequent as it was intimate. These letters display the boldness
of those councils which F&eacute;nelon gave to the woman who in
her turn counselled the king. He encouraged her to reign.
"You have more resolution than you believe yourself to possess."
(He wrote thus in obedience to an expressed wish of
hers that he would speak the truth, no matter how severe.)
"You distrust yourself, or rather, you fear entering into discussions

<!-- page 52 -->

opposed to the inclination you have always felt for
a life of tranquillity and retirement. . . . . As the king is
guided much less by the force of principles than by the impulsion
of those individuals who surround him, and upon whom
he bestows his authority, it becomes essential that he should
be influenced upon all occasions by truly good men, who,
acting in concert with you, will induce the fulfilment, in their
most extended view, of those duties which he never contemplates.
Since he must be surrounded, the grand point is, how
to surround him; since he must be ruled, how to rule him.
His welfare consists in his being influenced by those who are
upright and disinterested. You must, then, apply yourself to
the task. Give him views of peace; induce him to ameliorate
the condition of the people; above all, to adopt principles of
moderation and equity; to suppress all harsh and violent
counsels, and to hold in abhorrence acts of arbitrary authority.
. . . There are at Court many people of virtuous and noble
qualities, who merit your kindness and encouragement; but
you must exercise great precaution, for thousands would become
hypocrites to please you."</p>

<p>We see that F&eacute;nelon speaks of the errors of the king, as a
man who places himself entirely in the power of Madame de
Maintenon, the future mistress of his confidences; we also see
that, faithful to friendship, he sought to draw towards the
virtuous section of the Court, the Dukes de Chevreuse and
Beauvillier, all the favor of the sovereign ruler. We must not,
however, forget that the cause of virtue was at the same time
the cause of his friends and patrons.</p>

<p>This correspondence, and this pious intercourse between
Madame de Maintenon and F&eacute;nelon, gained more and more for
the future author of "Telemachus" the regard and esteem of
one who reigned with uncontrolled power: she frequently
reverted with pleasure, in her advanced years, to the sentiments
she had then experienced.</p>

<p>"I have often since wondered," writes she, "why I did not
select the Abb&eacute; de F&eacute;nelon as the guide of my conscience
when his manners charmed me so much, and when his mind

<!-- page 53 -->

and virtues had so influenced me in his favor." She, more
than any other woman in her position, required the society of
a man in all points equally attractive and superior, surrounded
as she was by common-place spirits, and by empty coldness.
"Ah!" (she wrote at one period to her favorite niece), "alas
that I cannot give you my experience, that I could only show
you the weariness of soul by which the great are devoured;
the difficulty which they find in getting through their days.
Do you not see how they die of sadness in the midst of that
fortune which has been a burden to them? I have been
young and beautiful; I have tasted many pleasures; I have
been universally beloved. At a more advanced age I have
passed years in the intercourse of talent and wit, and I
solemnly protest to you, that all conditions leave a frightful
void."</p>

<p>This friendship of Madame de Maintenon for the most fascinating
man in the kingdom, inspired the monarch with the
idea of recompensing F&eacute;nelon for his success in the education
of his grandson, by the gift of the Abbacy of Saint-Valery.
The king in person announced to him his gracious intention,
and made many excuses for bestowing upon his services so
tardy and disproportionate a reward. All things seemed to
smile upon F&eacute;nelon. The heart of Madame de Maintenon
seemed to have gained for him the love of the entire Court.</p>

<p>But a snare was upon his path, and this snare lay in himself,
in his pure soul, and in his poetic imagination. He
allowed himself to be seduced, not by his success, but by his
piety.</p>

<p>We have already stated at the commencement of this narrative,
that the court of Louis the Fourteenth, in his advanced
age, resembled rather a synod than a seat of government; and
that the most subtle dogmas of orthodoxy and theology occupied
the place of war and politics. We must now proceed to
name the period when the fortune of this bright genius, and,
perhaps the destiny of France, were overthrown by the hallucinations
of a woman and the anger of Bossuet.</p>

<p>About that epoch there resided at Paris a young, beautiful,

<!-- page 54 -->

and rich widow, Jeanne-Marie de Lamothe. She had been
married to M. Guyon, the son of the constructor of the canal
of Briare, whom she had lost at the early age of twenty-eight.
Madame Guyon was gifted by nature with beauty of a dreamy
and melancholy order, a passionate soul, and an imagination so
exalted that earth could not satisfy it; but seeking for love it
mounted to heaven. She had been acquainted in Paris, before
her marriage, with a young Barnabite recluse, of the name of
Lacombe. The tender piety and mystic exaltation of this
monk, produced upon the heart and mind of the young neophyte,
one of those sudden impressions wherein grace and
nature seem equally mingled; as in the friendship of St.
Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales and Madame de Chantal, where it was impossible
to discern whether admiration was most yielded to
celestial virtue or human attraction. Madame Guyon, who
had always kept up a correspondence with her religious
instructor, no sooner became a widow than she retired to Gex,
a little village of Bugey, on the declivity of the Jura, where
Father Lacombe awaited her. The Bishop of Geneva, who
held as a fief the small village of Gex, was acquainted with the
name, the attractions, the talent, the fortune, and the already
notorious sanctity of the young widow. He considered it as
an added glory to his Church, that a woman so endowed with
natural and supernatural gifts should bury all in this solitude
in order to consecrate them to the service of God. He therefore
resolved to bestow upon Madame Guyon, the direction of
a convent of young girls, converted by his exertions from the
schismatic doctrines of Calvin. Madame Guyon selected
Father Lacombe for the superior of her convent. The intimacy
of the widow and the monk, consecrated by the pious intercourse
of their mutual residence, became exalted almost to a
sort of ecstasy. The ardent imagination of the woman soon
surpassed that of the man; the master changed places with
the disciple, and received from the eyes and lips of his penitent,
inspirations and revelations as direct manifestations from
heaven.</p>

<p>This mystic commerce appeared suspicious to the minds of

<!-- page 55 -->

the unsophisticated. The Bishop of Geneva, after having involuntarily
favored it, became alarmed, and removed the monk
in disgrace to Thonon, another small village in his diocese,
upon the banks of the lake of Geneva. Madame Guyon immediately
followed her spiritual friend, and retired to an
Ursuline convent at Thonon, where she constantly received
Father Lacombe without restraint, and continued that ecstatic
intercourse which gave her complete dominion over his feebler
spirit, which it both subdued and charmed. From thence she
went to Grenoble, to expand the fame of her heavenly love in
conference with a small number of sectarians. The forests
and rocks of the Grand Chartreuse attracted her by their sublime
grandeur, and she there seemed to resemble the Sibyl of
the desert. Finally, hoping to find on the other side of the
Alps, the Italian imagination more susceptible of the fire of
her new doctrines, she sent her disciple, Lacombe, to preach
her faith at Verceil, in Piedmont. Thither she again followed
him, and wandered about in his company for several years,
from Gex to Thonon, from Thonon to Grenoble, from Verceil
to Turin, from Turin to Lyons, leaving the world undecided
between admiration and scandal. Admiration prevailed with
all who examined closely the sincerity of her enthusiasm, the
austerity of her life, and the purity of her habits. Upon her
return from this long pilgrimage, she published at Lyons an
exposition of the Song of Solomon, and several other works
upon meditation. The doctrines they inculcated were drawn
from Plato, and the first Christian commentators, chiefly those
belonging to Spain, that country of enthusiasm. Their object
was to inculcate upon pious minds, as the type of true perfection,
the love of the Deity for himself alone, devoid of all desire
of reward or fear of punishment. She recommended also
a profound and absorbing contemplation of God, wherein the
soul, drowned in the ocean of the divine essence, would contract
the sinlessness of a purely innocent spirit, and becoming
incapable of ascent or fall, would cast the body aside as a
worn-out vestment, leaving it at liberty to fulfil its simply material
functions, while the soul, exalted to heaven, would cease

<!-- page 56 -->

to be held responsible for its earthly tenement. It was in fact
the virtue of Divinity transplanted into man, by the indissoluble
union of man to the Divinity; the dream of every soul
upon earth, and the anticipated condition of heaven. These
maxims contained sublimity and sanctity for saints, but they
were replete with dangerous snares for vulgar minds.</p>

<p>The Church became alarmed at the rumor of such doctrines,
and the Cardinal Lecamus, Bishop of Grenoble, denounced
them to M. de Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, at Court. Madame
Guyon and Father Lacombe returned to the capital. The
apostle and disciple were both arrested; the monk was interrogated,
thrown into the Bastille, afterwards confined in the
Isle of Ol&eacute;ron, and ultimately incarcerated in the Castle of
Lourdes, amid the roughest wilds of the Pyrenees, there to
linger through many long and dreary years of expiation.
Madame Guyon, confined in a convent in the street of Saint-Antoine,
underwent the most strict examinations of the Church,
and cleared herself triumphantly from all the accusations of
scandal and impiety, by which she had been assailed upon her
return to Paris. She became the example, the worship, the
delight, and the admiration of the convent, which had been
selected as her prison. Madame de Miramion, a person at that
time also celebrated for her fervent light and zeal in the cause
of piety, heard of the female captive, sought an interview with
her, and became fascinated. She interceded with Madame de
Maintenon to obtain the liberty of a woman so unjustly persecuted.
Madame de la Maisonfort, a relative of Madame de
Maintenon, the Duchess of Bethune, daughter of the unfortunate
Fouquet, and Madame de Beauvillier herself, the daughter
of Colbert, united their entreaties to those of Madame de Miramion;
Madame de Maintenon granted liberty to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e
of such irreproachable women. In the first moment of her
freedom, Madame Guyon flew to express her gratitude to her
liberator. Madame de Maintenon succumbed to the universal
fascination; she felt drawn towards Madame Guyon as to the
focus of piety, eloquence, and grace, which had been only obscured
by the vapors of an effervescing imagination.  She introduced

<!-- page 57 -->

her to Saint-Cyr, an establishment where she had
assembled beneath her own inspection the elite of all the nobly
born young girls in the kingdom; and engaged her to
hold discourses there upon the mighty gifts of God, and to
communicate her contemplative and pious thoughts upon divinity
to the youthful residents. Madame de Maintenon stimulated
this good work by her presence. She became the
innocent accomplice of all the pious subtleties in which a
mystical spirit indulged when rhapsodizing on divine love;
and infected the sternest men about the Court with the same
degree of admiration, including the Duke de Beauvillier, and
the Duke de Chevreuse; and she admitted Madame Guyon to
a confidential intimacy inaccessible to others. It was in such
a position, and beneath such auspices, that F&eacute;nelon encountered
Madame Guyon. The resemblance in gentleness and
elevation of these two spirits, equally pious, and guided by
imaginations equally ardent, established at once between F&eacute;nelon
and Madame Guyon a spiritual intercourse, in which
there was no seduction but piety, and nothing to be seduced
but enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The mystic recitals of Madame Guyon, while affording such
ecstasy to F&eacute;nelon and Madame de Maintenon, appeared to
them as the exhalations of a peculiar devotion, the exercise of
which was suited only to the privacy of the sanctuary, and
which must be carefully veiled from the gaze of the vulgar, as
likely to produce only intoxication in the uneducated mind.
The king, whose faith was as simple as his imagination, held
a sterner opinion.</p>

<p>"I have read extracts from the works of our friend, to the
king," writes Madame de Maintenon, "but he tells me they
are mere ravings; he is not yet sufficiently advanced in piety
to appreciate their perfection."  She adds, in another place:
"The maxims of the Abb&eacute; F&eacute;nelon should not be published to
those who cannot understand them.  As regards Madame
Guyon, we must be content to monopolize her to ourselves.
The Abbe F&eacute;nelon is right in advising that her works should
be kept private, for they would preach of the liberty of the

<!-- page 58 -->

children of God, to those who have not yet become his children."</p>

<p>We see that F&eacute;nelon opposed himself to the display of an
ideal perfection likely to become a cause of offence to the
weak-minded; his spiritual accordance with Madame Guyon
was less complete than that of Madame de Maintenon and the
Court, and his admiration, held in check by prudence, though
enthusiastic, never reached the point of fanaticism.</p>

<p>His strong attachment to these doctrines proceeded from
his peculiar mental organization, and from a leaning to that
mystical love of the Deity, in which tenderness is mixed with
subtlety. Let us listen to him speaking of St. Teresa, and we
shall discover in his admiration the peculiar bent and natural
source of his own devotion. We shall at the same time perceive
the reserve, the judgment, and the prudence which ever
pervaded his lofty mind.</p>

<p>"From the simple worship in which Teresa was at first absorbed,
God elevated her mind to the most sublime height of
contemplation. She entered into that union where the virginal
marriage of husband and wife commences, where she becomes
all to him, he every thing to her. Revelations, the spirit of
prophecy, visions which assumed no tangible form, raptures,
ecstatic torments, as she herself said, in which the spirit is
overwhelmed, and the body succumbs, and in which the presence
of God is so realized that the soul sinks overwhelmed and
consumed, unable to support its burden of sublime awe; in
fact, every supernatural gift seemed poured upon her. Her
directors were at first sight mistaken. They judged of her
capability for the practice of virtue by the nature of her
prayers, and by the remains of that weakness and imperfection
which God left, in order to humiliate her. They concluded
her to be under the influence of a dangerous illusion which
they desired to exorcise. Alas! what trouble for a soul simply
desirous of obedience, and influenced, as that of St. Teresa was,
by terror, when she felt her mental powers completely overturned
by her instructors. 'I was,' said she, 'like one in the
midst of a river, on the point of being drowned without hope

<!-- page 59 -->

of succor. She no longer recognized herself, nor knew what
she said when praying. That which had formed her consolation
for so many years now added bitterness to her distress.
In order to obey, she tore herself from her inclination, but involuntarily
returned without the power to abandon or resume
it. Assailed by these doubts, she experienced all the horrors
of despair. Every thing seemed confused and terrifying;
every hope appeared to desert her. God himself, upon whom
she had hitherto reposed with such confidence, had become to
her as a dream; and in her agony she cried, like Mary Magdalene,
'They have taken away my Lord, and I know not
where they have laid him.'</p>

<p>"Oh! ye anointed of the Lord, cease not to study by incessant
prayer and meditation the most profound and mysterious
operations of his grace, since ye are its dispensers! What
does it not cost the souls that you instruct, when the coldness
of your peculiar studies and your ignorance of internal guides
cause you to condemn all that has not come within the course
of your experience! Happy are the souls who find men of
God, as St. Teresa ultimately did&mdash;the holy Francis de Borgia
and Peter of Alcantara, who smoothed the difficulties of her
path. 'Till then,' said she, 'I felt more shame in declaring my
revelations than I had ever experienced in the confession of
my greatest sins.' And shall we, too, shrink from speaking of
these revelations in a century when incredulity is considered
wisdom? Shall we blush at the mention of praise for that
grace which effected so much in the heart of St. Teresa? No,
no; be silent, O century! in which even those who believe
the truths of religion, pride themselves upon rejecting without
examination, as mere fables, all the miracles which God has
displayed in his elected instruments.</p>

<p>"I know that these emotions must be experienced in order
to feel that they come from God. God forbid that I should
sanction a weak credulity in extravagant visions! But let me
neither hesitate in faith where he directly sends the revelation!
He who poured miraculous gifts in a stream from on high
upon the first believers, has he not promised to shed his spirit

<!-- page 60 -->

upon all flesh? Has he not said, 'On my servants and on my
hand-maidens?' Although these latter times are less worthy
than an earlier period of such celestial communications, must
we therefore look upon them as impossible? Is their source
exhausted? Is heaven closed against us? Is it not rather
that the unworthiness of our age renders such mercies more
necessary, to enlighten the faith and increase the charity now
almost extinct?</p>

<p>"Ah! rather would I forget myself than forget the writings
of Teresa. So simple, so earnest, so natural, that in the act
of reading we forget that we read, and fancy ourselves listening
to her voice. Oh! how wise and gentle are those counsels
in which my soul has tasted of the hidden manna! with what
ingenuousness does she recount facts! It is not a recital, but
a picture. What a power does she possess of describing various
conditions! I behold with ecstasy, that like St. Paul,
words failed to express all that she conceived. What a living
faith! The heavens lay open before her. She comprehended
all things, and discoursed as familiarly of the sublimest revelations
as she did of the commonest occurrences. Imbued
only with a spirit of obedience, she spoke incessantly of herself
and her sublime gifts without pride or ostentation, without allusion
to any personal superiority. Mighty soul, which estimates
itself as nothing, and beholding God in all things,
abandons itself without fear to the instruction of others! Oh!
how dear are these instructions to all who seek to serve God
in prayer, and how highly have they been lauded by the voice
of the Church! I dare not display them to the gaze of the
profane. Away, away, haughty and prying spirit, seeking to
read these works only to tempt God, and to despise the riches
of his goodness! Where are ye, simple and meditative souls
to whom they belong? . . . If ye fully comprehend the happiness
of dwelling in God and seeking to dwell in him only, ye
will taste the centuple promise of this life; your peace will
flow on like a river, and your justice will be fathomless as the
depths of the ocean."</p>

<p>Despite the intention of the Abbe F&eacute;nelon and Madame

<!-- page 61 -->

Guyon to keep the new doctrines which so kindled their ardent
souls, confined within the precincts of St. Cyr and Versailles,
their fame transpired and reached the Archbishop of Paris,
Bossuet, and the Bishop of Chartres, the spiritual director of
Madame de Maintenon. These three oracles of the Church
united, and denounced F&eacute;nelon as a dangerous abettor of new
and presumptuous opinions, whom it was necessary, for the
safety of that religion so lately re-established, to remove from
the king and his grandson. Bourdalone, a celebrated and
venerated pulpit orator, consulted upon these doctrines, replied
in a stern letter: "Silence on these subjects is the best guardian
of peace: they should only be mentioned in sacred confidence
with spiritual directors." This private conspiracy of
harsh condemnation against F&eacute;nelon smouldered for a long
time before it burst into flame.</p>

<p>Nothing up to this period indicated any plan on the part of
Bossuet to lower his cherished disciple in the king's estimation;
he displayed only the alarmed suspicions incidental to a
believer in tradition who repels with contempt and pride all
new opinions; and the anxious grief of a doctrinal instructor
who beholds his pupil's faith wavering. The explosion of
Bossuet's holy indignation was caused by the feelings we have
described, and not by the impulse of petty jealousy; a passion
which has no existence in a haughty mind. Bossuet was
equally exalted in his nature and his pride; he envied not, he
crushed at once. With the thunderbolt in hand, ambuscade
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Bossuet likewise sought in the beginning of this quarrel
rather to suppress than condemn. He treated the visions of
Madame Guyon as the errors of a diseased mind. He consented
to see this celebrated female and listened with indulgence
to her explanations, and expressions of regret for the
troubles she had unintentionally caused. He invited her to
participate in the solemnities of his private chapel, and counselled
her to silence, obscurity, and absence from Paris and the
Court, during some months. He undertook in the mean time
to examine personally, and at his leisure, her writings, and to

<!-- page 62 -->

pronounce upon them a final decision, to which she should
submit with voluntary deference. He fulfilled his promise,
read, and censured the books of his fair penitent. He wrote
to her, and pointed out with pious benevolence passages opposed
to reason and dangerous to morality. He conversed
confidentially with F&eacute;nelon upon the aberrations of his spiritual
friend, and conjured him to join, in their condemnation.
F&eacute;nelon, convinced of Madame Guyon's orthodoxy, and distressed
at the persecutions by which she was menaced, attempted,
with more magnanimity than policy, to justify her in
the estimation of Bossuet. He refused to condemn as a theologian
that which he admired as a man, a poet, and a friend.
He replied that God often chose the feeblest instruments for
the manifestation of his glory; that the spirit was impelled
according to his will; that the lofty eloquence of prophets and
sibyls acknowledged not the laws which regulate the language
of the schools; and that before pronouncing the sentence of
madness upon those inspired by God, time should be allowed
to prove their revelations. Bossuet was overwhelmed with
grief.</p>

<p>The king, who meddled with theology, but comprehended
only the discipline and infallible authority of the Church, now
displayed his indignation. Madame de Maintenon, the introducer
of all this scandal to St. Cyr, to the Court, and the
Church, trembled at the thought of appearing before his Majesty
as the accomplice and abettor of those who had alarmed
the royal conscience. She immediately abandoned her friends
and withdrew from them her countenance. She did not, however,
at first unite with their persecutors, and continued to
render in secret, justice to their intentions and their innocence;
but she pressed for the assembling of a doctrinal synod to
judge the question, and to relieve her of a responsibility in
this affair which had become too weighty.</p>

<p>"Yet another letter from Madame Guyon," she writes;
"this woman is very troublesome; it is true she is also deeply
unfortunate!  She entreats of me to-day to procure the nomination
of M. Tronson, a friend of F&eacute;nelon, as one of the judges.

<!-- page 63 -->

I am not certain that the king would like to offer such a mortification
to the Archbishop of Paris . . . M. l'Abb&eacute; de F&eacute;nelon
has too much piety not to feel that it is possible to love
God for himself alone, and he has too great a mind to allow of
his believing that we can associate this love with the most
shameful vices. He is not solely the advocate of Madame
Guyon. Although he is her friend, he is the defender of religion
and Christian perfection. I repose upon his truth because
I have known few men equally sincere, and I permit you
to communicate this to him."</p>

<p>The conferences opened under the superintendence of Bossuet,
who, a stranger to all subtleties, entreated of F&eacute;nelon
again to initiate him into the mystic flights of various French
Spanish, and Italian works which the Church had tolerated,
and which he, in his rude common sense, denominated amusing
extravagances. F&eacute;nelon analyzed for Bossuet all the
books which contained the source from whence Madame
Guyon had drawn her peculiar enthusiasm, and the letter
which he wrote upon them proves that he was still restrained
by deference to the opinion of the Bishop of Meaux. "No
longer feel anxiety on my account" (thus he writes when
forwarding the volumes); "in your hands I am a mere child,
these doctrines pass by me without leaving an impression;
one form of belief appears to me as good as another. From
the moment that you spoke, all has been effaced. When
even what I have read appears to me as clear as that two and
two make four, I behold it less distinctly than the necessity of
rejecting the guidance of my own judgment, and of preferring
to it that of such a pontiff as you are! . . . I hold too firmly
by tradition ever to abandon that which in these days ought
to be the chief column of our support."</p>

<p>Meantime the Archbishop of Paris, impatient of the length
of these conferences, delivered separately his own opinion
against Madame Guyon and her doctrines. Madame de Maintenon,
fearing that F&eacute;nelon would be compromised in these
denunciations of the Church of Paris, and torn from the Court,
where she wished to retain him, had recourse to the seduction

<!-- page 64 -->

of royal favor in order to detach him from Madame Guyon.
The king appointed him Archbishop of Cambray. Under this
title, Madame de Maintenon hoped to associate him with those
bishops who were appointed as the judges of Madame Guyon,
and to compel his condemnation as a pontiff of that which he
had admired as a friend. The king at once entered into this
well-meaning plot, and we see here mingled all the ability of a
courtier and the affection of a warm adherent. She sought at
the same time to reassure the king as to the soundness of F&eacute;nelon's
doctrines, and to withdraw the latter from Madame
Guyon, whom she abandoned to the bishops.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, alarmed at the prospect of a dignity which would
separate him from his pupil, represented to the king that the
greatest honor, in his eyes, was the tender love subsisting
between himself and his grandson; and that he would not
voluntarily exchange it for any other. Louis the Fourteenth
answered him with great kindness, "No; I intend that you shall
still continue the preceptor of my grandson. The discipline
of the Church only demands nine months' residence in your
diocese. You will give the other three to your pupils here,
and you will superintend at Cambray their education during
the rest of the year as thoroughly as if you were at Court."</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, transported by such favors, resigned, contrary to
custom, an abbey which he possessed, and resisted with the
most exemplary disinterestedness all the persuasions and examples
which encouraged him to retain these ecclesiastical
revenues. He desired to carry to his bishopric no portion of
the income which he considered as belonging to others, who
were in necessity. The world admired, but hesitated to imitate
his example.</p>

<p>The king, through the instigation of Madame de Maintenon,
added him to the committee of bishops appointed to investigate
the doctrines of Madame Guyon; but the conference was
already dissolved, and Bossuet, sole reporter, and exclusive
dictator, privately arranged the decision. F&eacute;nelon, after having
discussed and succeeded in modifying the terms so far as
to exclude all personal censure of Madame Guyon, signed the

<!-- page 65 -->

exposition of the purely theological principles of this manifesto.
Peace seemed so thoroughly cemented between these two
oracles of the faith in France, that Bossuet desired to preside
in person, as consecrating pontiff, at the installation of his disciple
and friend. The king, his son and his grandson, with
the entire Court, assembled in the chapel of St. Cyr, to witness
the ceremony in which the genius of eloquence consecrated
the genius of poetry.</p>

<p>But scarcely had this peace been re-established by the intervention
of Madame de Maintenon, the forbearance of Bossuet,
the humility of F&eacute;nelon, and the silence of Madame
Guyon, when new causes of discussion sprang up between the
bishops. Madame Guyon secretly evaded the offer made to
her by Bossuet of a safe retreat in a convent at Meaux, the
capital of his diocese. She had written to him that she would
retire into solitude, far from the world and its storms; but she
still lingered at Paris, concealed among her disciples, whose
devotion daily became more fervent. In the number were included
F&eacute;nelon and his two friends, the Duke de Beauvillier
and the Duke de Chevreuse.</p>

<p>At this period the Archbishop of Paris died. He was a
man of worldly habits, whose demeanor disquieted the conscience
of the king. A successor of exalted virtue was now
sought for, to purify the see. The Church nominated Bossuet,
the public selected F&eacute;nelon. Madame de Maintenon hesitated
between the two; one was more dreaded, the other more
loved; suspicions of a tendency to new doctrines clung to F&eacute;nelon,
and apprehensions of tyranny were associated with
Bossuet. Madame de Maintenon bestowed the see of Paris
upon M. de Noailles, an exemplary pontiff and one in favor at
Court. Bossuet resented the injury with dignity, and neither
abased himself to solicit nor refuse. "All things show," wrote
he to his friends in Paris, "that God, as much from his mercy
as his justice, designs to leave me where I am. When you
desire that they should offer in order that I should refuse, you
seek only the gratification of my vanity. It would be better
to look for the increase of humility! there can no longer be a

<!-- page 66 -->

doubt that, despite the empty disquisitions of men, and according
to my own wishes, I shall be interred here at the feet of
my saintly predecessors, and shall continue to work out the
salvation of that flock which has been confided to me." The
grandeur of this ambition lay in its frankness. Bossuet resented
the indignity offered to his talents in the preference of
M. de Noailles; but he condescended neither to murmur nor
to regret. He did not even express a wish: he felt his vengeance
in his superiority.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whether from the humiliation he experienced
in being weighed in the scale against the youth of F&eacute;nelon
and the mediocrity of M. de Noailles, whether from any suspicion
that the disloyal evasion of Madame Guyon and her
continued residence in Paris was instigated by F&eacute;nelon, who
thus betrayed the confidence he had placed in his disciple, the
concealed resentment of his soul soon burst forth. He solicited
from the king the arrest of Madame Guyon, who was
consequently discovered in Paris, and incarcerated in a madhouse.</p>

<p>"How do you desire that she should be disposed of?" wrote
Madame de Maintenon to the Archbishop of Paris: "and
what are we to do with her friends and her papers?" "The
king remains here all day; write to him directly."&mdash;"I am
delighted at this arrest," also wrote Bossuet to Madame de
Maintenon; "this mystery concealed many injuries to the
Church."</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, then at Cambray, heard with grief that his friend
was to be conveyed to Vincennes. The Duke de Beauvillier
now began to fear that the education of the young Duke of
Burgundy would be taken out of the hands of F&eacute;nelon.</p>

<p>"It is evident," wrote he, "that a powerful and determined
intrigue exists against the Archbishop of Cambray. Madame
de Maintenon obeys what has been suggested to her, and is
ready to lend herself to any extreme measures in opposition to
him. I behold him upon the verge of being torn from the
princes, as a man suspected of inspiring them with dangerous
doctrines.  If this plan should succeed, my turn will follow;

<!-- page 67 -->

but I feel no anxiety with regard to myself. . . . As to M. de
F&eacute;nelon, I should not counsel him, even if he wished it, to
announce any formal condemnation of the books of Madame
Guyon. It would afford the greatest joy to the libertines of
the Court, and at the same time confirm all the injurious
reports which have been spread abroad to the prejudice of her
sanctity. . . . . Would not such a step afford grounds of belief
that he was an accomplice in all that they impute to this unfortunate
woman, and that policy and fear of disgrace compelled
his abjuration? I feel myself conscientiously forced on
all occasions openly to declare whatever can justify M. de F&eacute;nelon;
and when he is disgraced I shall do it still more loudly,
because it will then be even more evident that truth and justice
alone compel my vindication. . . . ."</p>

<p>After various examinations, Madame Guyon was transferred
to the convent of Vaugirard, under the superintendence of the
Cur&eacute; of St. Sulpice. "For this mild treatment," wrote Madame
de Maintenon, "we have not the approbation of Bossuet,
but for myself I feel it to be my duty as much as possible to
turn aside all severities."</p>

<p>"They desire me to condemn the person of Madame
Guyon," wrote F&eacute;nelon at the same time. "When the
Church issues a decree against her doctrines, I shall be ready
to sign it with my blood. Beyond that, I neither can nor
ought to agree to any thing. I have closely examined a life
which has infinitely edified me. Wherefore should they wish
me to condemn her upon other points of which I know nothing?
Would it be right that I should help to crush an individual
whom others have united to destroy, and one to whom
I have been a friend? . . . .</p>

<p>"As regards Bossuet, I shall only be too glad to adhere to
the doctrines of his book if he wishes it; but I cannot honestly
or in conscience join him in attacking a woman who appears
to me innocent, and writings which I have abandoned to
condemnation without attaching to them my own censure.
. . . . Bossuet is a holy pontiff, an affectionate and steadfast
friend; but he seeks, by an excessive zeal for the Church and

<!-- page 68 -->

friendship for me, to carry me beyond due bounds. . . . I believe
Madame de Maintenon to be influenced by the same
feelings. . . . She condemns and pities me by turns, with
every new impression that others convey to her. . . . All,
then, as regards myself, is reduced to this,&mdash;I will not speak
against my conscience, nor will I consent to insult a woman
whom, from what I have personally observed, I have reverenced
as a saint. . . ."</p>

<p>"If I were capable," added he, afterwards, in another letter
of tender reproach to Madame de Maintenon, who persecuted
him from friendship,&mdash;"If I were capable of approving of a
woman who preached a new gospel, I ought to be deposed and
brought to the stake rather than supported as you sustain me.
But I may very innocently have mistaken a person whom I
believe to be devout. I have never felt any natural affection
for her. I have never experienced any extraordinary personal
emotion, that could influence me in her favor; she is confident
to excess; the proof of this is manifest, since he (Bossuet) has
related to you as impieties the particulars which she confided
to him. . . . I count her pretended prophecies and her assumed
revelations as nothing. I have never heard her use the
blasphemous images which they attribute to her, in her mystical
disquisitions upon divine love; I would wager my head
that all this has been exaggerated; but Bossuet is inexcusable
for having repeated to you as one of Madame Guyon's doctrines
what in effect was nothing more than a dream or figurative
expression. . . . . All that has been said against her
conduct is mere calumny. I feel so persuaded of her never
having designed any thing evil, that I undertake to say on her
part that she will give every satisfactory explanation and retractation.
. . . Perhaps you think I say this in order to obtain
her liberty, but so far from that, I promise that she shall give
her explanations without quitting her prison. I will not even see
her; I will only write to her unsealed letters, which you and her
accusers shall read. . . . After all that, leave her to die in prison;
I am content that she should perish there&mdash;that we should
never see her again, and never more hear her name mentioned.</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>"Wherefore, then, madame, do you close your heart against
us, as if our religion were different from yours? . . . Fear not
that I shall oppose Bossuet; I never even speak of him but
as my master; I willingly look upon him as the conqueror
and as one who has brought me back from my wanderings;
in all sincerity, I feel only deference and obedience towards
him. . . ."</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, thus placed by his own imprudence, and by the
sternness of his adversaries, in such a position that his only
alternative was the crime of condemning one he believed innocent,
or the humiliation of condemning himself and drawing
upon his own head the thunders of Bossuet, who then ruled
the Church of France,&mdash;retired in sadness, and foreboding the
ruin of his cherished prospects, to the solitude of Cambray.
There, in order to vindicate the purity of his faith and to clear
himself from the accusations of Bossuet, he composed his
book, entitled "Maxims of the Saints." This was a justification,
through extracts taken from the works and opinions
promulgated by the very oracles of the Church, of the disinterested
love of God; the transcendent doctrine of the mystics
of all ages. He humbly submitted his manuscript, page by
page, to M. de Noailles, who promised that it should only be
inspected by his theologians, and not communicated to Bossuet.
He corrected from their notes every passage with which they
did not agree, in the most minute point; and his friend the
Duke de Chevreuse undertook to have the book published.</p>

<p>Bossuet, incensed at the rumor of the approaching appearance
of a book which had been kept a profound secret from
him, wrote as follows: "I feel sure that this work will be
productive of enormous scandal. . . I cannot in conscience
suffer it to go forth! . . . . God guides me to the knowledge
that they thus wish to establish presumptuous opinions, which
would lead to the overthrow of religion. . . . This is the truth,
for which I would sacrifice my life! . . . They exclude me on
this occasion, after having proffered so much submission in
words, simply because they feel that God, on whom I rely, will
give me the power of exploding their mine! . . ."</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p>The anger of Bossuet upon the appearance of this book was
contagious. F&eacute;nelon's justification appeared a crime against
the authority of the great oracle of the Church in France.
The king adopted the cause of the episcopal leader. D'Aguesseau,
an impartial and contemporary historian, attributed this
manifestation of anxiety by Louis the Fourteenth, to the bitter
aversion he cherished against the superior qualities of F&eacute;nelon.</p>

<p>"Whether the king feared," says D'Aguesseau, "minds of a
superior order; whether it was a refined singularity, a peculiar
reserve in the manner and habits of F&eacute;nelon, which were displeasing
to a prince whose ideas flowed in a simple and ordinary
current; whether it was that F&eacute;nelon, from a profound
policy, sought to absorb himself in his immediate functions,
and abstained from any attempt to insinuate himself into the
confidence and favor of the king; it is quite certain that Louis
the Fourteenth never loved him, and felt no repugnance against
sacrificing him to his enemies." Bossuet strengthened this
disposition by the fears which he excited in the king's conscience.
He accused himself "<i>of a criminal complicity, in not
having sooner revealed to the king the fanaticism of his pupil</i>."
The Court being made aware of the king's secret antipathy,
now universally joined in condemning the presumptuous arch-heretic.</p>

<p>"A nature so happily endowed," again said D'Aguesseau,
"was perverted, like that of the first man, by the voice of a
woman. His talents, his ambition, his fortune, even his reputation,
were all sacrificed, not to an illusion of the senses, but
to a fascination of the mind. We behold this sublime genius,
impelled to become the prophet and oracle of a sect, fertile in
specious and seducing imagery. He seeks to be a philosopher,
but we find him only an orator; a character which he has preserved
in every work emanating from his pen to the close of
his life."</p>

<p>Calumny went so far as to accuse F&eacute;nelon of having flattered
the king's devotion, in order to render it instrumental in
the advancement of his fortune; and of having planned a
junction of politics and mysticism, in order to establish

<!-- page 71 -->

through the unseen ties of a secret language, a powerful cabal,
at the head of which he would always reign by the force and
mastery of his genius. These imputations fell at once before
the courage displayed by F&eacute;nelon, in braving the anger of the
king, and opposing Bossuet, to support a persecuted woman,
and a calumniated doctrine. He was universally abandoned.
The dread of being involved in the disgrace into which he had
voluntarily precipitated himself, caused every one to fear and
avoid, not only any attempt in his justification, but also every
emotion of pity. He remained as much isolated at Versailles
as he had been at Cambray, while he awaited in daily expectation
an order to exile himself from the Court. It was in this
crisis of mental distress that a fire consumed his episcopal
palace of Cambray, with the furniture, books, and manuscripts,
comprising all the wealth he had transported thither. He
received this blow with his habitual serenity. "I had rather,"
said he to the Abb&eacute; Langeron, who hastened to inform him of
this domestic calamity, "that the fire had seized my house
than a poor man's cottage."</p>

<p>In the mean while Bossuet fulminated severe censures against
F&eacute;nelon's book, but at the same time continued to display the
feelings of old attachment. "It is hard," said he, "to speak
thus of one accustomed till now to listen as readily to my
voice as I listened to his in return. God, before whom I now
write, is aware of the agony which has demonstrated my deep
grief, that a friend of so many years should judge me unworthy
of his confidence; I who have never even raised my voice in a
whisper against him! the friend of my whole life! . . . . a
beloved adversary, who, as God is my witness, I love and cherish
in my inmost heart! . . . ."</p>

<p>At the moment when Bossuet wrote these lines, the king
sent an order to F&eacute;nelon, commanding him to quit Versailles,
and repair to Cambray, without pausing at Paris. He forbade
his going to Rome to make any appeal to the Pope for a judgment
upon his doctrines, fearing, doubtless, that his genius and
virtue would exercise the same influence at Rome as everywhere
else. The king, at the same time, wrote to Rome, to

<!-- page 72 -->

demand from the sovereign pontiff the condemnation of the
Archbishop of Cambray, promising to carry it into execution
by all the power of his royal authority.</p>

<p>The separation between F&eacute;nelon and the Duke of Burgundy,
his pupil, mutually lacerated their hearts. The tears of the
Duke de Beauvillier, and of the Duke de Chevreuse, mingled
with those of the young prince and his friend. The Duke of
Burgundy in vain threw himself at the feet of the king his
grandfather imploring him to send a counter-order, a reprieve,
a pardon. "No, my son," replied the king; "I have no power
as a master to make this a matter of clemency. It touches the
safety of our faith; Bossuet is a better authority on this point
than either you or I!"</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon was deeply distressed, but continued
the more inexorable from having been an accomplice, and refused
to see F&eacute;nelon.</p>

<p>The Duke de Beauvillier, faithful to virtue as to friendship,
unbosomed all his feelings to the dispenser of grace. "Sire,"
said he to the king, "I am the work of your Majesty's hands;
you have elevated and you can abase me. In the commands
of my sovereign I recognize the commands of God. I shall
quit the Court, Sire, with regret for having displeased you, but
with the hope and prospect of a life of greater tranquillity."</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon conjured the Duke de Beauvillier and his friends to
adopt a different course, and not to involve themselves in his
ruin. "I am here overwhelmed by the opprobriums which all
have cast upon me," he wrote to these friends; "but let me
alone be sacrificed. In a short time all the unreal dreams of
this life will vanish, and we shall be reunited forever in the
kingdom of truth, where we shall encounter neither error,
division, nor censure; where we shall be partakers of the peace
of God! In the mean time let us suffer, let us hold our peace
too happy if by being trampled in the dust our ignominy tends
to his glory!"</p>

<p>Arrived at his diocese, F&eacute;nelon gave himself up entirely to
study and to works of charity. From this solitude emanated
thousands of pages breathing the literary genius of the purest

<!-- page 73 -->

works of antiquity, and the modern inspiration of Christian
benevolence. They treat of the Divinity with a lofty power
of mind and language, and often display the tenderest enthusiasm.
We feel that each word contains a prayer, or some
license of adoration, as heat pervades vitality. We may with
truth say, that F&eacute;nelon could not name God without a prayer.</p>

<p>We shall present to the reader a few pages extracted at
hazard from the multiplicity of treatises and letters in which
he poured forth his thoughts: they depict his mind with more
fidelity than any expressions we could select of our own.</p>

<p>"Every thing in the universe bears the stamp of Divinity;
the heavens, the earth, plants, animals, and above all the
human race. All things demonstrate a consistent design, a
chain of subordinate causes, connected and guided in order,
by one superior cause." . . . . "There is nothing left to criticise
in this great work:&mdash;the defects which we encounter
proceed from the uncontrolled and disordered will of man,
who produces them by his own blindness; or they are designed
by that God, who is always holy and just, for the punishment
of the unfaithful; and sometimes he uses the wicked
as instruments to exercise and draw the good to perfection.
Often that which appears to our limited view an error, proves
by its ultimate purpose to be a portion of the great universal
design, the sublime whole which our finite intellects are incapable
of comprehending. Does it not occur each day that
certain portions of the works of men are hastily blamed? and
does it not require a comprehensive mind to grasp the extent
of their designs? This is continually evidenced in the productions
of painters and architects."</p>

<p>"If the characters used in writing were of enormous size,
when viewed closely one alone would occupy the whole vision
of a man; it would be impossible for him to distinguish more
than one at a time; he would be incapable of assembling them
in a body, or of reading their collective sense. It is the same
with the great features displayed by Providence in the entire
guidance of the world during a long succession of centuries;
only as a whole can it be intelligible, and the whole is too vast

<!-- page 74 -->

for a close inspection. Every event resembles a single character,
too great for the insignificance of our organs, and conveying
no meaning if separated from the rest. When, at the end
of all time, we shall behold God truly as he is, and comprehend
the sum of events which have fallen upon the human race from
the first day of the universe to the last, and their proportionate
aim in the designs of the Almighty, then we shall exclaim,
'Thou only, O Lord, art wise and just!' "</p>

<p>"But after all, the greatest defects in this creation are
merely the blemishes left by God, in order to show us that he
raised it from a void. There is nothing in the universe which
does not and should not display these two opposite characters:&mdash;on
one side the sea of the Great Worker, and on the
other the mark of that nothingness from which all has proceeded,
and into which at any moment all may again be resolved.
It is an incomprehensible mingling of baseness and
grandeur, of frailty in material, and of art in construction.
The hand of God shines through all gradations, down to the
organization of an earthworm; while nothingness reveals itself
everywhere,&mdash;even in the sublimest and most comprehensive
genius."</p>

<p>"All that is not of God can possess only a limited perfection;
and that which possesses only such a limited perfection
remains always incomplete at the point where the limit reveals
itself, and proves to us that much is still wanting. The creature
would become the Creator himself, if nothing were wanting
to him; for he would possess the fulness of perfection,
which comprises actual divinity. Since, then, we cannot become
infinite, we must remain limited in perfection; that is to
say, imperfect in some particular point. We may possess
more or less imperfection; but, after all, must be ever imperfect.
It is desirable that we should always mark the precise
point in which we are wanting, that penetration may declare,
This is what we might still have, and what we do not
possess. . . . ."</p>

<p>"Let us study creation in any way we may select;&mdash;whether
we descend to the minutest detail; whether we examine

<!-- page 75 -->

the anatomy of the most insignificant animal; whether
we closely inspect the smallest grain of corn sown in the
ground, and the process by which this germ multiplies itself;
whether we observe with attention the arrangement by which
a rosebud expands under the rays of the sun, and closes
towards the approach of night;&mdash;we shall discover a more
perfect plan of arrangement and industry than in all the works
of art. That which we even call the art of man, is nothing
more than a feeble imitation of the great art which we denominate
the laws of nature, and which the impious have not
blushed to call blind chance."</p>

<p>"Must we, then, wonder if poets have animated the whole
universe; if they have given wings to the wind, and arrows
to the sun; if they have painted the great rivers which rush
to precipitate themselves into the sea, and the trees, which,
mounting towards heaven, conquer the rays of the sun by the
depth of their shade? So natural is it to man to feel that art
with which all nature is replete, that these figurative expressions
have become colloquial. Poetry merely attributes to
inanimate things the intents of that Providence which guides
and sets in motion all their operations. From the figurative
language of poets, these ideas have been transfused into the
theology of pagans, whose ministers of religion were their
bards. These have imagined the existence of an art, a power,
a wisdom which they called a <i>numen</i> (divinity), even in creatures
the most devoid of intelligence. With them the rivers
were gods, and the fountains naiads. The woods, the mountains,
possessed their peculiar divinities. The flowers had
Flora, and the fruits Pomona. The more we study nature
with an unprejudiced mind, the more do we discover in all
things a deep and inexhaustible wisdom, which is, as it were,
the soul of the universe."</p>

<p>"What follows from all this? The conclusion comes of
itself. 'If so much thought and penetration is required,' says
Minucius Felix, 'only to examine the order and wonderful design
of the structure of the world, how much mightier must
that wisdom have been which formed all! If we admire

<!-- page 76 -->

philosophers to such an extent for having merely discovered a
small portion of the secrets of that power which created, must
we not indeed be blind if we do not admire the Creator
himself?' "</p>

<p>"This is the grand object of the entire world in which God
reflects himself, as it were, in a mirror before the human race.
But these (I speak of philosophers) are lost in their own ideas,
and all things for them are turned into vanity. From the
effect of subtle reasoning, many of them have lost sight of a
truth which simply and naturally, and unaided by philosophy,
we may find in ourselves. . . . ."</p>

<p>"A traveller penetrating into the Sa&iuml;s, the country of the
ancient Thebes of a hundred gates, would find it now deserted,
but would discover columns, pyramids, obelisks, and inscriptions
in unknown characters. Is it likely that he would say,
this place has never been inhabited by man; human hands
have never labored here; it is chance which has formed these
columns, which has placed them upon their pedestals, and
which has crowned them with their capitals, all in such just
proportion; it is chance which has so firmly united the different
pieces that form the pyramids; it is chance which has
hewn the obelisks from a single stone, and engraved upon
them all these characters? No; would he not rather say with
the most certain conviction of which the mind of man is capable,&mdash;'These
magnificent ruins are the remains of the majestic
architecture which flourished in ancient Egypt!' "</p>

<p>"This is what simple reason would utter at first sight, and
without feeling the necessity of any argument on the question.
The same applies to the first glance thrown upon the universe.
We may confuse ourselves with vain reasonings, and render
obscure that which was as clear as possible before; but the
first simple impression is the true one. Such a work as the
world cannot have formed itself; the bones, the tendons, the
veins, the arteries, the nerves, and the muscles which compose
the frame of man, display more art and nicety of proportion,
than all the architecture of ancient Greece or Egypt. The eye
of the smallest animal surpasses in its structure the most perfect

<!-- page 77 -->

human mechanism. If we found a watch amid the sands
of Africa, we should not venture to declare seriously that
chance had formed it in these deserts; and yet men have felt
no shame in saying that the bodies of animals, the mechanical
art of which no watch can ever equal, are merely the results
of chance! . . . ."</p>

<p>"O my God! If so many do not behold thee in the sublime
spectacle of creation which thou bestowest upon them, it
is not because thou art far removed. Each of us can touch
thee as it were, with the hands, but the senses and passions
dwelling within us prevent all recognition of thee by the mind.
Thus, Lord, thy light shineth in darkness, and the darkness is
so profound that it comprehendeth it not. Thou displayest
thyself in all things, and in all things heedless man neglects
to perceive thee. All nature speaks of thee, and resounds thy
holy name; but she speaks to those who do not hear, who are
deaf because they confound themselves in their own mazes.
Thou art about and within them, but they are as fugitives who
fly from their own nature. They would find thee, oh, shining
light! oh, eternal beauty! always old, and always new; oh,
fountain of pure delight! oh, pure and blessed life of all those
who truly live, if they would but seek thee within their own
hearts. Yet the impious lose thee only by losing themselves.
Alas, they are so absorbed in thy gifts, that that which ought
to display, prevents their seeing the hand of the giver; they
live by thee, and live without thinking of thee; or rather, die
within reach of life, from imbibing no nourishment from life;
for what a death it is to be ignorant of thee! . . . ."</p>

<p>"I am convinced that there is of necessity in nature a Being
who exists by himself; and is consequently perfect. I know
that I am not this being, because I am infinitely below infinite
perfection. I feel that he is distinct from me, and that I live
through him. Nevertheless, I discover that he has given me
the true idea of himself in making me comprehend the existence
of an infinite perfection, in which I cannot be mistaken,
for I hesitate at no bounded perfection that presents itself to
me. Its limit compels me to reject it, and I say to it in my

<!-- page 78 -->

heart, Thou art not my God; thou art not infinitely perfect;
thou art not created by thyself. Such perfection as thou hast
is measured; there is a point beyond which thou hast nothing,
and thou art but nothing."</p>

<p>"The same applies not to God; he is all; he is, and can
never cease to be; he is, and for him there is neither degree
nor measure; he is, and nothing is but through him. Such is
my belief. Since then I know that he is, there is nothing
marvellous to me in the existence of such a being. All things
around me are but through him; but that which is wonderful
and inconceivable, is that I should be able to comprehend him.
It must be that he is not alone the immediate object of my
thoughts, but as much their creator as he is the author of my
entire being; let him raise that which is finite to the contemplation
of the infinite."</p>

<p>"This is the prodigy that I bear continually within me. I
myself am a prodigy. Being nothing, at least possessing only
a dependent, limited, and transient existence, I hold by the infinite
and immutable which I have conceived. This is where
I am incapable of comprehending myself; I embrace all, and
yet am nothing, a nothing which knows the infinite. Words
fail me to express how much I at once admire and despise
myself. O God! O Being beyond all beings! O Being before
whom I am as if I were not! Thou showest thyself unto me,
and nothing which is not of thee can resemble thee. I behold
thee; it is thyself, and the light of thy countenance reaches
me, and supports my heart while waiting for the great day of
truth."</p>

<p>"I demand wherefore has the Almighty given us this capacity
of knowing and loving him. It is manifestly the most
precious of all his gifts. Has he accorded it to us blindly,
without reason, purely by chance, not intending that we should
use it? He has bestowed upon us corporal eyes to behold the
light of day. Can we believe that he has given us spiritual
eyes, capable of seeing his eternal truth, and yet desire that
we should remain in ignorance? I confess we cannot infinitely
know or love infinite perfection.  Our loftiest recognition will

<!-- page 79 -->

ever reman infinitely imperfect compared with a Being of infinite
perfection."</p>

<p>"In a word, intimately as we may be acquainted with God,
we can never comprehend him; but we know him sufficiently
to recognize all things in which he is not, and to attribute to
him those sublime perfections which are his without any fear
of error. The universe holds no being that we can confound
with God, and we know how to represent his infinite character
as one, and incommunicable. We must seek to know him
distinctly, since the clearness of our idea of him must force us
to prefer him to ourselves. An idea which compels us to
dethrone self must indeed be a powerful one&mdash;with blind mankind,
so prone to self-idolatry. Never has any idea been so
combated, never has any idea proved so victorious. Let us
judge of its strength by the confession of weakness it tears
from us. . . . ."</p>

<p>"We have preserved the book, which bears all the marks
of divinity, since it is this volume which inculcates upon us
the supreme love and knowledge of the true God. It is here
that the Almighty speaks as God, when he says '<i>I am</i>.' No
other book has painted God in a manner worthy of him: the
deities of Homer are the opprobrium and derision of divinity.
The volume which we hold in our hands, after having shown
God to us such as he really is, inculcates the only faith worthy
of him. It speaks not of appeasing him by the blood of victims;
it tells us to love him better than ourselves; we must
love him for himself alone, and for his love; we must renounce
ourselves for him, and prefer his will to our own: his love will
then create in us every virtue, and exclude each inclination to
vice. This is such a renewal of the heart of man as man himself
could never have imagined. He could not have invented
a religion which would lead him to abandon his own thoughts
and his own will, to follow implicitly that of another. Even
when this religion is offered to him by the most supreme
authority, his mind cannot conceive it; his inclination revolts,
and his deepest feelings are agitated. We need not be surprised
at such a consequence, since it is a faith which teaches

<!-- page 80 -->

man to debase and crush the idol, self; to become a new
creature, and to place God in the shrine which self has hitherto
occupied, in order to make him the source and centre of our
love. . . . ."</p>

<p>"God has united mankind in a society, where it becomes a
general duty to love and succor each other, as the children of
one family, owning a common father. Every nation is merely
a branch of this numerous family, which is spread over the
whole surface of the globe. The love of this universal parent
ought to reign sensibly, manifestly, and inviolably, throughout
the entire community of his beloved children. None of these
should ever fail to say to those who proceed from them, 'Know
the Lord, who is thy Father.' "</p>

<p>"These children of God are only placed in the world to
acknowledge his perfection; to fulfil his will; and to communicate
to one another the recognition of his power and divine
love."</p>

<p>"There ought, then, to be amidst us a body devoted to the
worship of God. This is true religion; that all men should
instruct, edify, and love one another, in order to love and
serve the common Father. The essence of religion consists in
no external ceremony, but in perfect knowledge of truth and
surpassing love."</p>

<p>"But merely to know God is not sufficient; we must also
demonstrate our knowledge, and in such a fashion that none
of our brethren can be so unfortunate as to continue in ignorance
or forgetfulness. These visible signs of faith are merely
the tokens by which men show their desire for mutual edification,
and their wish of reawakening in each other the remembrance
of the faith they bear within. Man, weak and inconsiderate
as he is, requires the constant renewal of such outward
signs, to reveal to him the presence of the invisible God whom
he ought to love. . . . ."</p>

<p>"This, then, is what is denominated religion. Sacred ceremonies,
the public worship of God our Creator, are the means
by which man, who cannot recognize and love the Almighty
without making his love evident, seeks to display his adoration

<!-- page 81 -->

to an extent proportioned to the greatness of its object. He
literally seeks to excite love by the signs of love itself."</p>

<p>The question of the book of "The Maxims" was long debated
at Rome. F&eacute;nelon sent one of his most fervent disciples, the
Abb&eacute; de Chant&eacute;rac, thither, to defend him against the accusations
of Paris. While the pontifical court deliberated with the
slowness and prudence by which it was characterized, an excited
controversy between F&eacute;nelon and Bossuet proceeded in France.</p>

<p>"What can be thought of your intentions?" said F&eacute;nelon to
Bossuet. "<i>I am that beloved disciple whom you cherish in your
inmost heart;</i> you go everywhere lamenting over me; and while
you compassionate, you destroy. What can be thought of
these tears, which tend only to give greater force to your
accusations? . . . ."</p>

<p>"You compassionate me, and pervert the meaning and text
of my words? . . . ."</p>

<p>"Who was the originator of this scandal? Who has written
with such a bitter zeal? You; you, who no longer deserve
that I should keep silence, while you bring against me the
most atrocious accusations!"</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;"Yes, I say it with grief," responded Bossuet, "you
seek to refine upon holiness; you hold nothing of value but
the beauty of God by itself. You complain of the force of my
expressions? and they relate to new doctrines which you seek
to introduce into the Church! . . . ."</p>

<p>"The world calls my language exaggerated, bitter, severe,
and bigoted, because I will not allow a dogma to establish
itself quietly without unveiling its error! Ought I to let it
flow concealed, and, by such weakness, to relax the holy rigor
of theological language? . . . . If I have done aught beyond
this, show it to me! If I have done only this, God will be my
protector against the weakness of the world and its hypocritical
complaisance."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;"You and I are both," replied F&eacute;nelon, "the objects of
derision to the irreligious, and the cause of mourning to good
men! That all other men should act as fallible beings is not
surprising; but that the ministers of Jesus Christ, the angels

<!-- page 82 -->

of the Church, should offer such a spectacle to a profane and
unbelieving world, calls for tears of blood! Too happy should
we be if, instead of this war of doctrines, we had taught our
catechism to the poor villagers of our dioceses, to lead them
to the love and knowledge of God!"</p>

<p>Bossuet having sent to Rome, upon his part, one of his
nephews, the Abb&eacute; Bossuet, to solicit the thunders of the
Vatican against F&eacute;nelon, this young priest, possessed of none
of his uncle's qualifications, save his violence and love of rule,
incessantly spread abroad in Rome the shadows of calumny
against F&eacute;nelon and his doctrines. "Press matters forward,"
he wrote to his uncle; "what do you wait for in order to deprive
F&eacute;nelon of the title of preceptor to the prince? Make
no delay in sending hither any one who can bear testimony to
the attachment of M. de Cambray for Madame Guyon, for the
father Lacombe, for their doctrines and their mode of life; this
is of the greatest importance! . . . .</p>

<p>"I am enchanted with the little book" (a horrible calumny
printed in Holland); "he has been named there, and well named;
it has produced here a terrible effect to his disadvantage."</p>

<p>This future Jansenist was carried by zeal of sect and family
so far as to call F&eacute;nelon in his correspondence, "<i>This ferocious
beast!</i>"</p>

<p>During these negotiations, the calumnies circulated at Rome
and Paris excited great animosity, and tended not only to cast
a stain upon the conduct of Madame Guyon and the doctrines
of the Archbishop of Cambray, but also upon his virtue.</p>

<p>The mind of the monk Lacombe, inclosed in the dungeons
of the Ch&acirc;teau de Lourdes, in the Pyrenees, became weakened
and confused by the torture of solitude. He had latterly written
several letters to the Bishop of Tarbes, in which he appeared
to acknowledge a guilty connection with Madame
Guyon. As soon as these confessions of delirium were known
at Paris, the monk was transferred to the Ch&acirc;teau of Vincennes.
There he wrote a letter to Madame Guyon, either
under suggestion or compulsion, in which he exhorted her as
his accomplice to confess their mutual errors, and to repent.</p>

<!-- page 83 -->

<p>The Cardinal de Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, read this
letter to Madame Guyon, and also the sum of the confused
avowals made by the monk. She suspected him of insanity,
and said that the ravings of a prisoner were used against her
and F&eacute;nelon. She at once defended herself from such horrible
imputations. Her denial and indignation were looked upon as
crimes. Transferred to the Bastille to undergo a stricter captivity,
she persisted in declaring her innocence, and continued
to endure her punishment. In the mean time, her accusers
hastened to forward these infamous letters to Rome, in order
to tarnish the fame of F&eacute;nelon, on whose ruin they were determined.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Noailles, Bossuet, Madame de Maintenon
herself, upon the evidence of these maniacal ravings, doubted
no longer the guilt of the monk and Madame Guyon. "These
letters," wrote the Abb&eacute; Bossuet, to his uncle, "make more
impression than twenty theological demonstrations; these are
the arguments that we required." The monk's insanity soon
transpired; he was thrown into a lunatic asylum, where he
died in delirium. They were forced to acknowledge that F&eacute;nelon
had never seen the monk, nor entered into any correspondence
with him.</p>

They revenged this disappointment to their animosity by
banishing all F&eacute;nelon's friends from the court of the Duke of
Burgundy. Bossuet published a discourse on "Quietism," in
which all his anger and his condemnation of their doctrines
assumed a grave tone towards the sectarians themselves. F&eacute;nelon
sought to keep silence, fearful of drawing the Duke de
Beauvillier into his own ruin, who was now his only friend attached
to the person of his pupil. The arguments of his representative
at Rome at length induced him to reply, and his
answer changed and melted all hearts.</p>

<p>The contrast of the stern severity of Bossuet to the patient
forbearance of the accused, became evident to the eyes of all.
"Can you compare," exclaimed F&eacute;nelon, at the close of his
reply, "your proceedings to mine? You publish my letters
only to defame me. I publish yours to show that you were

<!-- page 84 -->

my <i>consecrator</i>. You violate the secrets of my most private
correspondence only to cause my destruction! I make use of
yours (but only after you have shown mine), and then not to
accuse you, but to vindicate my oppressed innocence!</p>

<p>"These letters of mine which you have brought forward,
contain, next to confession, the greatest secrets of my life, and
render me according to your definition, the <i>Montanus</i> of a new
<i>Priscilla</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah! why does such glory as yours descend to defame me?
Who can refrain from being astonished that genius and eloquence
are so far misled as to compare an innocent, legitimate,
and necessary defence, to such an odious revelation of the secrets
of a friend?"</p>

<p>"We find with grief," says the contemporary D'Aguesseau,
"that one of these two great opponents <i>has spoken falsely;</i>
and it is certain that F&eacute;nelon knew, at least, how to gain in
the public estimation the advantage of consistency."</p>

<p>"Who will deny his ability?" exclaimed Bossuet, while
reading this defence; "he has enough <i>to alarm any one!</i>
his misfortune is being implicated in a cause calling for so
much!"</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon soon showed in this crisis of his life, that his soul
was superior to his genius.</p>

<p>But the condemnation of the "Book of Maxims" did not
arrive; Rome hesitated. Pope Innocent the Twelfth faintly
concealed his secret conviction of the innocence of F&eacute;nelon,
of the purity of his manners, and the charm of his virtue.
The Cardinals who were appointed to examine his book were
half in favor and half against it. Bossuet and Louis the
Fourteenth interfered, and dictated the order of suppression in
an imperative letter to the sovereign pontiff.</p>

<p>"I cannot learn, without grief," said the king to the Pope,
"that this necessary judgment should be retarded by the
machinations of those whose interest it is to suspend it. Quiet
can only be obtained by a clear, plain decision, which admits
of no ambiguous interpretation, and which will strike at the
root of the evil. I demand this judgment for your own credit

<!-- page 85 -->

added to those great motives which ought to induce you to
show that consideration which I beseech you to accord to my
request," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>While this objurgation was dispatched to the Pope, accompanied
by a severe reprimand to the king's ambassador for his
weakness, Louis the Fourteenth forestalled the condemnation
by ordering the list of the officers of the household of the
Duke of Burgundy to be brought to him, and with his own
hand struck off the name of F&eacute;nelon from the office of preceptor,
deprived him of his salary, and shut up his apartment
at Versailles.</p>

<p>Thus prevented from exercising his office as teacher, and
from entering the palace, F&eacute;nelon quickly discovered that the
sentence of the Church would strike him even in his pontifical
character. "<i>Lord, save us, or we perish!</i>" wrote his faithful
friend, the Abb&eacute; of Chant&eacute;rac from Rome, "though our sufferings
will be blest if they serve to defend the true love of
God." "And I rejoice to think that it will preserve our union
throughout time and eternity. Ah! how often have I exclaimed
in these troubled and gloomy days, '<i>Let us go and die
with him!</i>' "</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>let us die in our innocence</i>," replied F&eacute;nelon. "If God
desires my services no longer in my ministry, I shall think of
nothing for the rest of my life but my own love for him, as I
can no longer impress it on the minds of others."</p>

<p>At the same time, the death of Madame Guyon in the Bastille
was announced to him. It was a false report, but F&eacute;nelon
believed it to be true. "They have just told me," wrote he,
"that Madame Guyon has died in her captivity. I must say
now after her death what I have often repeated during her
life, that I knew nothing of her but what was in the highest
degree edifying. Were she an incarnate angel of darkness, I
can only speak of her as I found her on earth. It would be
an act of horrible cowardice to do otherwise for the sake of
delivering myself from personal apprehension. I have nothing
to conceal for her sake: truth alone restrains me."</p>

<p>At length, the condemnation obtained with so much trouble

<!-- page 86 -->

from the mild justice of Innocent the Twelfth arrived in Paris,
accompanied by a shout of joy from the enemies of F&eacute;nelon at
Rome. "We send you the skin of the lion we have had
much trouble in catching," wrote they, "and who has for
many months astonished the world by his roaring."</p>

<p>At the moment when F&eacute;nelon received at Cambray the first
news of his condemnation, he was about to ascend his pulpit
and address the people on a sacred subject, upon which for
some days he had been meditating. He had not time to
exchange a syllable with his brother, who had been the bearer
of the information, that he might soften this heavy blow.
Those who were present could not observe that he either colored
or grew pale at the fatal intelligence. He knelt for a
moment with his face buried in his hands, that he might
change the subject of his discourse; and rising with his usual
calm inspiration, he spoke with impressive fervor upon the
unreserved submission due under all conditions of life to the
legitimate authority of superiors.</p>

<p>The report of his condemnation spreading from mouth to
mouth in whispers throughout the cathedral, caused all to fix
their eyes upon him, and his resignation drew tears from
many. The whole flock appeared to suffer with their pastor.
He alone felt himself sustained by the hand that had just
struck him, for his grief was not caused by pride, but by the
uncertainty of his conscience. The authority which he recognized,
in freeing him from this doubt, at the same time released
him from his mental agony. He had submitted his conscience
to the Church; she had pronounced her sentence; he believed
it to be the voice of heaven, and submitted to the decision.</p>

<p>"The supreme authority has eased my conscience," wrote
he, on the evening of the same day. "There remains nothing
for me now but to submit in silence, and to bear my humiliation
without a murmur. Dare I tell you that it is a state
which carries with it consolation to an upright man who cares
not for the world? The humiliation is without doubt most
painful, but the least resistance would cost my heart much
more."</p>

<!-- page 87 -->

<p>The next day he published a declaration to his diocesans, in
which he accused himself of error in his book of "Maxims of
The Saints." "We shall console ourselves," said he in this
avowal, the most Christian act of his life, "for our mortification,
provided that the minister of the word sent by God for
your edification be not weakened, and that the humiliation of
the pastor may increase the grace and fidelity of his flock."</p>

<p>This great action and these beautiful words were interpreted
by the enemies of the living F&eacute;nelon as a sacrifice of his pride
as a bishop to the still greater pride of the courtier. They
saw in it an artful desire to raise a pretext by which his rivals
might lose favor, an advance towards reconciliation at the
expense of his conscience, with Louis the Fourteenth, a base
and pretended disavowal of those religions opinions which he
still held intact in his soul, and which he only condemned from
policy. Impartial judgment must free his memory from these
calumnies. If F&eacute;nelon had possessed sufficient worldly ambition
and dissimulation to disavow an opinion displeasing to the
king and Court, he would also have had enough of the same
qualities to prevent his expressing his views openly before
them, and thus risking a disgrace voluntarily incurred. He
had been out of favor for several years, therefore it is not likely
that at the end of his martyrdom he would have renounced
his faith. The truth is, that he suffered for his transcendental
philosophy and ethereal piety, as long as it was only reprobated
by the king and the world; but the instant that religious
authority had pronounced its opinion, he sacrificed to duty that
which he had refused to immolate to ambition.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the official sentence of Rome did not change
in his inmost heart his sublime convictions of the disinterested
and absolute love of God. He did not believe he was mistaken
in what he had felt, but thought he might have gone too far in
expressing it; above all, he imagined that the Church wished
to impose silence with regard to those subtleties which might
trouble the minds of the people, and interfere with ecclesiastical
government; and he submitted in good faith, humility, and
silence.</p>

<!-- page 88 -->

<p>This humility and silence, which instructed the world, increased
the irritation of his enemies.  They wished to overthrow
the author of a heresy, but in F&eacute;nelon they found only
a victim to admire.</p>

<p>"It is astonishing," exclaimed Bossuet, himself, "that F&eacute;nelon,
who is so keenly alive to his humiliation, should be insensible
to his error. He wishes every thing to be forgotten except
that which redounds to his honor. All this is like a man who
seeks to place himself under the shelter of Rome, without perceiving
the advantage."</p>

<p>The genius of this great man only served in this instance to
illustrate his hatred, which he carried with him to the grave.
His death speedily succeeded his triumph. "I have wept before
God and prayed for this old instructor of my youth,"
wrote F&eacute;nelon, to a friend, when he heard of this event, "but
it is not true that I celebrated his obsequies in my cathedral
and preached his funeral sermon. You know that such affectation
is foreign to my nature."</p>

<p>Bossuet's persecution of this most gentle of disciples has
stained his memory. Nothing goes unpunished in this world,
not even the weaknesses of genius.</p>

<p>The zealous ardor of the pontiff for the unity of faith cannot
excuse the cruelty of the polemical controversialist. Bossuet
was a prophet of the Old Testament; F&eacute;nelon an apostle of
the Evangel;&mdash;the one an embodiment of terror, the other an
emblem of charity. All admire Bossuet as a writer, but who
would wish to resemble him as a man? It becomes the expiation
of those who know not how to love, that their memory
is not regarded with affection.</p>

<p>Madame Guyon, the cause of all these troubles, was liberated
from Vincennes after the death of Bossuet, and resided
in exile in Lorraine with one of her daughters. She died there
after many years, still celebrated for that unchanging piety and
virtue which justified the esteem of F&eacute;nelon.</p>

<p>All now appeared tranquil, and promised to F&eacute;nelon a
speedy return to the charge of his pupil, the Duke of Burgundy,
whom the lapse of years had brought nearer to the

<!-- page 89 -->

throne, when the treachery of a copyist who gave to the
printers in Holland a manuscript of Telemachus, plunged the
author once more and forever into disgrace at Court, and excited
anew the anger of the king. Telemachus, thus pirated,
burst forth like a revelation, and spread with the rapidity of
fire. The times called for it; the vicissitudes of glory and
tyranny, the servitude and misfortunes of the nation at the
end of the wars of Louis the Fourteenth, had impressed the
whole mind of Europe with a sort of presentiment of this
book. It contained the vengeance of the people, a lesson to
kings, the inauguration of philosophy and religion into politics.
A brilliant and harmonious poetry served as the organ of truth
as well as fiction.</p>

<p>All responded to the gentle voice of a legislative and poetical
pontiff, who presented himself to instruct, console, and
charm the world. The presses of Holland, Belgium, Germany,
France, and England, could not issue enough copies of Telemachus
to satisfy the avidity of its readers. It became in a few
months the gospel of modern imagination; a classic in its
birth.</p>

<p>The reputation of this great work reached Louis the Fourteenth.
His courtiers, in pointing out to him his likeness, in
the feeble and hard-hearted Idomeneus, the scourge of his people,
said, "He who has thus painted your majesty's portrait,
must be your enemy." They saw in the recitals and theories
of paganism an injurious satire upon monarchs and government.
Public malignity delighted to find in all the personages
of which F&eacute;nelon's pictures were composed, resemblances to
the king, the princes, the ministers, and favorites of both
sexes. These portraits, conceived and executed in the palace
of Versailles, at a time when F&eacute;nelon enjoyed all the confidence
that the king placed in the preceptor of his heir, appeared
as a flagrant instance of domestic treason.</p>

<p>The refined dreams of F&eacute;nelon, contrasted with the sombre
realities of the Court, and the sadness of a reign in its decline,
rose like so many accusations against the representative of
royalty.  Temerity and black ingratitude were attributed to

<!-- page 90 -->

the mind of a poet, whose only fault amounted to his having
indulged in creations of the fancy more surpassingly beautiful
than those of nature herself. The instinctive antipathy of
Louis the Fourteenth to F&eacute;nelon originated in indignation and
resentment. When we compare the reign and the poem, we
can scarcely feel surprised, or accuse the king of injustice.
Such a book, composed under the shadow of the palace, and
published without the knowledge of the prince, appeared in
truth a most outrageous satire, as well as a cruel violation of
the intimate confidence and majesty of the sovereign. The
mind of F&eacute;nelon, in writing it, had never conceived the sinister
allusions and ungrateful accusations which were attributed
to him. He had innocently surrendered himself to his pure
imagination, which colored every thing up to the level of his
own moral perfection, his candor and love of human nature.
He wished to prepare in silence, for the instruction of his royal
charge, a model of a monarch, and of legislative government.
It was neither his intention nor his fault that the resplendent
virtue which shone forth in his speakers and personages should
throw a deeper shadow upon the arbitrary, haughty, and persecuting
reign of Louis the Fourteenth. The dread even of
these remarks had made him conceal his poem, as a mysterious
secret between himself and his pupil. He had no desire to
make it the vehicle of personal fame; he reserved it for the
instruction and glory of a future sovereign. He never sought
literary publicity for his writings; they were intended for the
contracted privacy of friendship or religion, and their own
brilliancy was the cause of their more extensive circulation.</p>

<p>It was in this view that he had composed Telemachus.
This poem, which he destined not to see the light until after
the death of Louis the Fourteenth, he had written with his
own hand in his private apartments, and afterwards had it
copied by a person on whose fidelity he thought he could rely.
He intended it as a legacy to his family, that they might make
such use of it after his death as the times admitted. In his
own private feeling, the publication of Telemachus caused him
as much trouble as grief. He saw in it his certain condemnation

<!-- page 91 -->

to a perpetual exile, and beheld himself in the situation
of a public enemy in a court which would never forgive him.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken. The universal resentment against
him was immediate. The Court had an intuitive feeling of
the harm which this book would do them in the eyes of posterity,
and unskilfully disguised their terrors under the semblance
of disdain.</p>

<p>"F&eacute;nelon's book," said Bossuet, who was still alive at the
time of its first reputation, "is a romance. Opinions are
divided on the subject; the cabal admire it, but the rest of
the world consider it scarcely serious enough to be worthy of
a clergyman."</p>

<p>"I have not the least curiosity to read Telemachus," writes
Madame de Maintenon. The king, who seldom read any
thing, disdained to peruse it. The Court thought to smother
it in silene. It was agreed at Versailles that they should not
even mention the name before the king, and they believed
the book forgotten by the world, because they chose to forget
it themselves.</p>

<p>Sixteen years later, when Telemachus, printed in every form,
and translated in every language, inundated all Europe, the
orators of the French Academy, in speaking of the literary
works of their time, were silent upon this, which held possession
of the age, and will descend to all posterity.</p>

<p>The anger of the Court deeply grieved the Duke of Burgundy,
whom separation, injustice, and adversity had more
strongly than ever attached to his preceptor. To escape the
jealous tyranny of his grandfather, he was obliged to make a
secret of his attachment to F&eacute;nelon, and to conceal as a State
crime his correspondence with his friend.</p>

<p>"At last," wrote the young prince, "I find an opportunity
of breaking the silence which I have been forced to maintain
for four years. I have suffered many evils, but one of the
greatest was the not being able to tell you what I felt for you
during this long interval, and how much my love has increased,
instead of being diminished, by your misfortunes. I reflect
with delight upon the time when I shall see you again, but I

<!-- page 92 -->

fear that period is still far distant. . . . I continue to study
alone, and I am fonder of reading than ever. Nothing interests
me more than philosophy and ethics, and I am continually
practising myself in those exercises. I have written several
little essays, which I should like to send to you to correct. . .
I will not tell you in this, how angry I am at all that they have
done to you, but we must submit for the present. . . . Do not
show this letter to any person whatever, except only to the
Abb&eacute; de Langeron, for I can depend upon his secrecy; and do
not answer it. . . . ."</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon replied from time to time by letters written at long
intervals, containing the advice of a man of piety and a statesman,
and filled with expressions of paternal tenderness.</p>

<p>"I speak to you only of God and yourself," wrote he; "you
must not think of me. Heaven be praised, my mind is at
peace; my most severe cross is not beholding you; but I bear
you with me before God in a more intimate form than that of
the senses. I would give a thousand lives as a drop of water,
to see you all that Heaven intended you to be. Amen.
Amen."</p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy, in going to take command of the
army in Flanders, during the campaign of 1708, passed by
Cambray.</p>

<p>"The king was less concerned," says St. Simon, "with the
equipment of his grandson, than with the necessity of his passing
near Cambray, which place he could not avoid without an
appearance of studied intention. He was strictly forbidden,
not only to sleep there, but even to stop and dine; and to
avoid the chance of a private interview with the archbishop,
the king further commanded him not to leave his carriage.
Saumery was instructed to see this order strictly complied
with; he acquitted himself like an Argus, with an air of
authority that scandalized everybody. The archbishop was
waiting to receive them at the post-house, and approached his
pupil's carriage as soon as it arrived; but Saumery, who had
just alighted, and informed him of the king's orders, stationed
himself at his elbow. The crowd surrounding the young prince

<!-- page 93 -->

were moved at the transports of joy which escaped him, in
spite of all restraint, when he beheld his preceptor. He embraced
him repeatedly, and the warmth of the glances which
he darted into the eyes of the archbishop, conveyed all that
the king had interdicted, and expressed an eloquence which
none could behold without emotion. The prince only stopped
to change horses, but without hurry; then followed fresh embraces,
and they parted. The scene had been too public, and
had excited too much curiosity not to be reported on all sides.
As the king had been strictly obeyed, he could not find fault
with what had been so little concealed from those who pressed
around, or with the looks that were exchanged between the
prince and the archbishop. The Court thought much of this,
and the army still more. The influence which, notwithstanding
his disgrace, the archbishop exercised in his own diocese,
and even in the Netherlands, communicated itself to the troops,
and those who thought of the future, from that time forth
passed more willingly by Cambray, in their journeys to and
fro from Flanders, than by any other route."</p>

<p>It was at Cambray, during those sad years in which confederated
Europe made Louis the Fourteenth atone for the
splendor of his government, the long prosperity, and exalted
glory of his entire reign, that we must chiefly admire F&eacute;nelon.
In recurring to the past, posterity meets with nothing more
beautiful, more simple, more devoted, more wise, more respectable,
or more respected, than this supremely amiable man,
devoting himself to the duties of his mission. As priest, bishop,
administrator for the poor, friend, citizen, and man, all the
noble sentiments which adorn human nature shone forth, collected
with remarkable brilliancy in this single individual.
Above all, throughout the vicissitudes of a complicated and
unfortunate war, of which his diocese was the theatre and the
victim, he appeared as the most touching personification of
charity. The true qualities of Christian love, called forth each
day by the miseries which increased them as they themselves
augmented, caused the name, and above all, the presence, of
F&eacute;nelon to be blessed by many voices.  In his example, they

<!-- page 94 -->

found a resource which assisted them to brave the common
calamity with patience and resignation. Imagination became
excited, and added a thousand particulars to the truths which
were so naturally combined with it, that they only appeared
to embellish facts to paint them with more fidelity. A kind of
legend thus grew beneath the steps of the "<i>good archbishop</i>,"
and followed him like the sweet odor of his virtues. These
true or exaggerated recitals of charity are commemorated in
all the records of the time.</p>

<p>During the winter and scarcity of 1709, this charity was
exercised with the most active zeal, and under the greatest
variety of forms, in order to ameliorate the triple trials of war,
cold, and famine. Disasters accumulated. The strong places,
which had been fortified with so much care by the prudence
of the king, fell into the enemy's power. The troops, badly
paid, forgot their discipline and obedience, as they had also
forgotten the way to victory. The treasury was empty. The
inexhaustible imagination of the exchequer was thoroughly
worn out, and knew not upon what pretext, or by what mercenary
bait, to extract another crown from the country. The
severity of the weather had everywhere rendered the grain
which had been sown unproductive. During the winter, men
expired of cold; and when the summer came, they might be
seen lying dead of starvation, with a bunch of withered herbs
in their mouths. In numerous towns and provinces, seditions
unexpectedly burst upon the government, which found its
resources everywhere exhausted. Executions followed on the
mad extravagances of misery. Peace, which he had never
known how to preserve, now fled from the humble solicitations
of Louis the Fourteenth. The ambition of Prince Eugene and
the avarice of Marlborough prolonged the war, which was
profitable to them, and to their glory. After Hochstedt and
Ramillies, Oudenarde, Lille, and Malplaquet, appeared to toll
the funeral knell of France. She retained for a long time the
cruel impression, and shudders still at the remembrance of
that year when God appeared to punish men for their discord
in accumulating with a severe hand the full measure of

<!-- page 95 -->

those evils which they had commenced by heaping on themselves.</p>

<p>But above this sad recollection, and inseparably connected
with it, there still rises the remembrance of one of those great
men, accorded as an example and consolation under the heaviest
blows which it pleases the Divine Providence to dispense&mdash;an
immutable law established by historical evidence. To alleviate
anarchy, spring up virtuous patriots; to soothe calamities,
heroes of charity; to temper the massacre of the Indians, there
was Las Casas; to assuage the fury of the religious wars,
L'H&ocirc;pital; amid the vices of his times, St. Vincent de Paul;
at Milan, Charles Borromeus; at Marseilles, Belzunce; and to
balance against the executioners during the reign of terror,
there were the victims. Flanders, and the year 1709, possessed
F&eacute;nelon. In these redeeming signs may be recognized
the hand which only chastises to instruct.</p>

<p>The episcopal palace of Cambray was transformed into the
common asylum of the unfortunate. When it became too
small to contain them, F&eacute;nelon opened his seminary, and hired
several houses in the town. The inhabitants of entire villages,
which had been ravaged by the soldiers, took refuge under his
protection. These poor people were received like children;
and those who had suffered most, were treated with the first
and greatest care. On the other hand, generals, officers, and
soldiers, sick or wounded, were brought to this untiring charity,
which never paused to count the numbers to be relieved.
Let us give attention to what St. Simon says upon this subject.
He praises rarely, and then against his will; but when he
writes of F&eacute;nelon, he is forced to wipe away the gall from his
pen:</p>

<p>"His open house and table had the appearance of those at
a governor of Flanders, and of an episcopal palace, combined.
There were constantly many renowned officers, and distinguished
soldiers, sick, wounded, or in good health, living with
him. All expenses were defrayed by him, and they were
served equally, as if there was only one honored guest to attend
upon. He himself was usually present at all the medical and

<!-- page 96 -->

surgical consultations. He also exercised towards the sick and
wounded, the functions of the most charitable pastor; and
often went to the houses and hospitals in which the soldiers
were lodged, to fulfil the same office. All these duties were
performed without neglecting any thing, without any interested
motive, and always with an open hand. A liberality well
understood, a magnificence which never insulted, was showered
alike on officers and men; and although he exercised this
unbounded hospitality, his table, furniture, and equipages, were
within the limits of his station. He gave in secret, with equal
eagerness and modesty, all the assistance that could be concealed,
and which was incalculable. He used such consideration
towards others, as to make those on whom he conferred
favors believe that he was the obliged party; and he showed a
common politeness to all, so carefully modified that it appeared
to each like a mark of personal consideration. In all things
he acted with that nice delicacy in which he so singularly
excelled. He was beloved by every one. Admiration and
devotion filled the hearts of all the inhabitants of the Netherlands,
throughout every district, who looked up to him as an
object of universal love and veneration."</p>

<p>Behold, then, F&eacute;nelon in his true vocation. He devoted
himself to the unfortunate. He did better than merely succor
and nurse them; he lived with them entirely. In his
own house, in the hospitals, in the town, he was to be seen
wherever his presence was necessary. No miseries disgusted
him, no infectious diseases deterred him from the motive which
inspired him with the most earnest desire to soothe those who
suffered; he bestowed what was better than alms or medicine&mdash;a
look, a gentle word, a sigh, a tear. He thought of
all, he foresaw all, he descended to the most minute details.
Nothing appeared to him beneath his care, and nothing was
beyond his ability to accomplish. This was only the natural
exercise of his heart. He kept his mind at liberty, he prayed,
he meditated like a monk in the cloister. As a man who
sought to occupy his leisure hours, he continued an extensive
correspondence, kind, useful, serious, and full of information,

<!-- page 97 -->

with the most distinguished men, and often upon the most
intricate and arduous questions. Theologian and bishop, he
composed several works, instructions, and essays upon difficult
subjects, which at the moment occupied the Church of France.
His powers and resources appeared exhaustless, as if he had
only to draw them from the depths of his own soul. Rigid
and sparing in his habits, he was accustomed to eat alone, and
live entirely upon vegetables. He did not even partake of the
repast which he provided for his guests, and allowed himself
nothing that he could spare for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>The veneration which his name inspired enabled him to
cross the enemies' lines, through which our arms had been
unable to force a passage. Alone and unprotected, he could
traverse his entire diocese. The most disorderly of all the
troops, the Imperial hussars, might be seen attending him as a
voluntary escort in his pastoral journeys. The estates which
belonged to him, respected by the orders of Eug&egrave;ne and Marlborough,
became a refuge for the peasants of the neighborhood,
who, at the approach of the soldiers, ran there with their
families, and all that they could carry. Often, the better to
protect their grain, woods, and fields from marauders, the generous
enemy would place a guard over them.</p>

<p>On one occasion, carts laden with corn arrived in the square
at Cambray, under the escort of some of Marlborough's soldiers.
Fearing that the scarcity of provisions would not permit this
supply to remain long in security in the little town of Cateau
Cambr&eacute;sis, where F&eacute;nelon had placed it, the English general
caused it to be brought into the French city, within view of
his own camp. It is the privilege of great minds to elevate
others to their own standard, and to inspire as well as perform
noble actions. The sanctity of the archbishop conferred reflected
honor even on the enemies of his country, from the
respect with which it inspired them for his character.</p>

<p>The devotion of F&eacute;nelon was not simply confined to private
actions. He even assumed the noble part of a public deliverer,
and brought succor to his country. The consequences of the
admiration which he inspired, were useful to France. At the

<!-- page 98 -->

moment when our army, without food, was nearly annihilated
by hunger, he had the glory (and never was there a purer or
more personal renown) of saving it. He opened his store-houses
to the ministers of war and finance; and when the
comptroller-general asked him to name the price of the corn
which necessity had rendered so valuable, he replied, "I have
given it up to you: order as much as you please; it is all
yours."</p>

<p>At the same time, he wrote thus to the Duke de Chevreuse:
"If money is wanting for pressing emergencies, I offer my service
of plate, and any thing else that I possess, and also the
small quantity of corn which still remains. I wish to serve my
country with my money and my blood; and not simply to
make myself popular at Court."</p>

<p>And when no sacrifice or effort could any longer supply the
most urgent necessities of the army and inhabitants of Flanders,
he addressed the following letter to the commissioner-general,
in which he paints to the life the miseries against which he was
struggling:</p>

<p>"I can no longer delay that which our desolated city and
country compel me to communicate. It is to beg you instantly
to have the kindness to procure us the succor which you have
long promised in the king's name. This district and town
have had no other resource for the entire year than the produce
of the oat crops, the corn having entirely failed. Consider
then, sir, that the armies, which are almost at our doors,
and who can only subsist upon what is left, will consume a
great portion of the oats still in the fields: and much more
will be destroyed by waste and plunder than from regular
foraging. . . . . Wheat is no longer to be procured; it has
risen to such an enormous price that even the most industrious
families cannot afford to buy it, and it is, moreover, extremely
scarce. We have no barley; and the little oats we have left
will not suffice for the men and horses alone. The people
must perish; and a contagion is to be dreaded, which may
extend from hence to Paris. . . . . Further, you understand,
sir, better than anybody, that if the people can neither plant

<!-- page 99 -->

nor live, your troops will not be able to exist upon a frontier
whose inhabitants are unable to furnish them with the commonest
necessaries. You see also that it will be impossible to
carry on the war next year in a ruined country. That in which
we now are has almost fallen into this last extremity; we can
no longer assist our poor, for the rich are themselves reduced
to poverty. You have done me the honor to inform me that
the king will have the goodness to send into this district a large
supply of grain, that is to say, barley and oats. There are no
other means of preserving a frontier so close to Paris and so
important to France. I should consider that I failed in my
duty to God and the king, did I not represent our condition to
you without disguise. We expect every thing from the compassion
of his Majesty towards these people, who will not show
him less affection and fidelity than his subjects of the ancient
kingdom. . . . ."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king was growing old, and a sudden illness
carried off the father of the Duke of Burgundy, the son of
Louis the Fourteenth, who would have succeeded to the throne
before the pupil of F&eacute;nelon. The courtiers, who now saw no
step between the monarchy and the young duke, began to
turn their eyes towards the rising sun, and once more to perceive
F&eacute;nelon in the background. The picture that the court
lynx, St. Simon, has drawn of the death of the great dauphin,
father of the Duke of Burgundy, exposes to the light of truth
the darkest hearts. Never has the veil of interest, egotism,
simulated grief, secret joy, fluctuating hope, hourly changing
from the throne to the tomb, been so pitilessly drawn aside by
the pen of a great satirist.</p>

<p>"While Meudon was overwhelmed with despair, Versailles
remained tranquil and unsuspecting. Supper was over; some
hours after, the company had separated, and I was conversing
with Madame de St. Simon, who was preparing to retire to
rest, when a valet de chambre of the Duchess de Berri entered
in consternation, and told us that bad news had arrived from
Meudon. I then immediately ran to the Duchess de Berri's
apartments.  Nobody was there.  They were all gone to the

<!-- page 100 -->

house of the Duchess of Burgundy, whither I followed immediately.</p>

<p>"I there found all Versailles either already assembled, or
arriving. The ladies in dishabille, the greater number as they
had been preparing for bed, the doors all open, and every thing
in confusion. I learnt that Monseigneur, the dauphin, had
received extreme unction, that he knew nobody, and that his
condition was hopeless. The king had sent to inform the
Duchess of Burgundy that he was going to Marly, and that
she was to meet him in the avenue between the two stables,
that she might see him as he passed.</p>

<p>"This assembly attracted all the attention that was not occupied
by the various emotions of my soul, and by what at the
instant presented itself to my imagination. The two princes
and princesses were in a small cabinet in the space between the
bed and the wall. The night toilet was usually held in the
chamber of the Duchess of Burgundy, which was now filled
by the whole Court in a state of utter bewilderment. She
went backwards and forwards from the closet to the bedroom,
waiting for the moment when she was to meet the king. She
maintained her usual graceful demeanor, but filled with a sorrow
and compassion that each individual present thought was
caused by their own trouble. She spoke a few words to every
one in passing to and fro. All had most expressive countenances,
for even eyes that had never before beheld the Court
could easily distinguish the eager expectations depicted on
some features, from the inanition of those who looked for nothing.
These latter remained tranquil, but the former were
obliged to hide, under the appearance of excessive grief, the
overflowing of their joy.</p>

<p>"My first impulse was to make many inquiries, and not to
believe readily what I either saw or heard; my next, to think
that there was not much cause for such great alarm; and
finally, to consider within myself that misfortune is the common
lot of all mankind, and that I too should some day find
myself at the gates of death. A feeling of joy, however
crossed these momentary impressions of religion and humanity,

<!-- page 101 -->

by which I was trying to recall myself. My own personal
deliverance appeared to me so great and unexpected, that I
considered it even a more perfect evidence than truth itself,
that the State would be the gainer by this great loss. In the
midst of these reflections, I could not help entertaining, in
spite of myself, a fear that the sick man might yet recover,
and I felt greatly ashamed of the feeling.</p>

<p>"Although thus apparently plunged in thought, I did not
fail to remark to Madame de St. Simon, that it was fortunate
she had come; and to cast peering but furtive glances upon
every face, demeanor, and movement, to satisfy my curiosity;
to feed the opinion that I had formed of each individual,
which had never yet deceived me; and to draw just conjectures
of the truth from those first impulses which people can
so seldom master, and which, to those who know the machinery
and the puppets, are sure indications of sentiments and
feelings which are almost imperceptible in moments of greater
self-possession.</p>

<p>"I saw the Duchess of Orleans arrive, but her composed
and majestic countenance told nothing. Some moments after,
the Duke of Burgundy passed with a troubled countenance,
full of care, but the glance which I quickly threw towards
him showed me nothing tender in his expression. I only beheld
the preoccupation of an absorbed mind.</p>

<p>"The valets and waiting-women were already weeping with
indiscreet violence, and their grief showed fully the loss which
their class were about to sustain. It was nearly half-past
twelve when news arrived of the king, and I immediately saw
the Duchess of Burgundy leave the little cabinet with the
duke, whose countenance appeared more moved than when I
saw him at first, and who quickly re-entered the closet. The
princess, taking from her toilet-table her scarf and head-dress,
deliberately crossed the apartment, her eyes scarcely moistened,
but her real feelings betrayed by stealthy looks cast here and
there as she passed along. Followed by her ladies alone, she
reached her carriage by the grand staircase.</p>

<p>"I took advantage of her leaving the chamber to seek the

<!-- page 102 -->

Duchess of Orleans, whom I was anxious to see. I ascertained
that she was in the apartments of Madame; and proceeding
through the other rooms, I found the duchess surrounded by
five or six of her familiar ladies. I felt impatient at the presence
of so large a company. The duchess, who was not less
annoyed at it, took a light and went to the back of her room.
I then proceeded to say a word or two privately to the Duchess
de Villeroy. She and I held the same opinions on the
present event. She pushed me away, and whispered to me in
a low voice to restrain myself. I was forced to be silent, amid
the complaints and surprise of the ladies, when the Duke of
Orleans appeared at the door of the cabinet and called me.</p>

<p>"I followed him into an interior apartment, situated below
upon the gallery; he, ready to faint, and I, with my legs trembling
under me, at all that was passing before my eyes and in
my mind. We seated ourselves accidentally opposite to each
other; but what was my astonishment when soon after I beheld
tears stream from his eyes! 'Monsieur!' cried I, rising
in the excess of my surprise. He understood me instantly,
and replied in a broken and truly lamentable tone of voice:
'You have a right to be surprised, and I am so myself; but
this event touches me deeply. He is a good man, with whom
I have passed my life; he has treated me kindly, and has ever
shown me as much friendship as they would permit. I know
perfectly well that this grief cannot last long: in a few days I
shall find motives for consolation from the state in which I was
placed with him; but at present, relationship, proximity, humanity,
all touch me, and my heart is grieved.' I applauded
this sentiment, and the prince rose, leant his head in a corner,
his face turned to the wall, and wept, sobbing bitterly; a circumstance
which, if I had not seen, I should never have
believed. I besought him to calm himself; he tried to do so
and just then it was announced that the Duchess of Burgundy
had arrived; he was obliged to join her, and I followed.</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Burgundy stopped at the avenue between
the two stables, and had not to wait long for the king's arrival.
As soon as he approached, she alighted and ran to the door of

<!-- page 103 -->

his carriage. Madame de Maintenon, who was on that side,
cried out, 'What are you about, Madame? Do not come near
us, we are infected!' I do not know what the king did, who
could not embrace her on this account. The princess instantly
re-entered her carriage, and returned.</p>

<p>"On her arrival she found the two princes and the Duchess
de Berri, with the Duke de Beauvillier, whom she had sent to
summon. The princes, each with his princess at his side, were
seated on the same couch, near the windows, with their backs
to the gallery; the rest of the assembly were scattered about,
some seated, some alone, and all in confusion throughout the
apartment. The most confidential ladies were standing, or
sitting on the ground near the sofa.</p>

<p>"Throughout the whole room every countenance might be
clearly read. Monseigneur was no more; they knew it; they
said it: there was no longer any restraint on his account, and
these first moments were those in which the emotions could be
viewed in their natural colors; for the instant, divested of all
studied policy by the unexpected trouble and confusion of the
night.</p>

<p>"Above all, might be heard the continual howling of valets;
then followed the lamentations of the courtiers of every degree.
The greater number, that is to say, the fools, drew sighs up
from their very heels, and with wild and dry eyes praised
Monseigneur, but always in the same words, lauding him for
his goodness, and pitying the king for having lost so virtuous
a son. The most cunning, or most considerate, became already
alarmed for the king's health. They had wit enough to retain
so much sagacity amid all this trouble, and did not leave room
to doubt it by the frequency of their repetitions. Others, truly
afflicted, and of the fallen party, cried bitterly, or tried to calm
themselves by an effort as palpable as their sobs. Amid these
various evidences of affliction, little or not at all appropriate,
there was no conversation. A casual exclamation might now
and then be heard to proceed from some unhappy individual,
who received an answer from his sorrowful neighbor. A word
in a quarter of an hour; haggard and sorrowful eyes; occasionally

<!-- page 104 -->

an involuntary movement of the hand, while all the
rest of their persons remained motionless. Those who were
only curious and little uneasy were few; not counting the
fools, who had nearly all the talk to themselves, asking questions
and exhibiting despair enough for all the rest. Those
who already looked upon this event as favorable, had great
difficulty in carrying their demeanor to the necessary point of
austere grief; but all was merely a transparent veil, which
could not prevent quick eyes from ascertaining real feelings.
These last were as careful as those who were really affected,
but their looks betrayed how in reality their minds were agitated.
Constant changes of position, like people who were
not at ease either sitting or standing, a careful avoidance of
each other from fear of a mutual encounter of eyes, the momentary
embarrassment which occurred when they did meet,
the appearance of a sort of indescribable freedom in their
whole air in spite of their efforts to restrain and compose
themselves; a quick and sparkling glance around betrayed
them notwithstanding their utmost endeavors at concealment.</p>

<p>"The two princes, and the two princesses seated at their
sides, taking care of them, were the most exposed to view.
Monseigneur the Duke of Burgundy, shed from real emotion
and good feeling, with a gentle mien, natural, religious, and
patient tears. The Duke de Berri also wept abundantly and
bitterly, and uttered not only sobs, but cries and groans.
These were carried to such an extent that they were obliged to
undress him on the spot, and to have recourse to doctors and
remedies. The Duchess de Berri was beside herself. The
most agonizing despair, mingled with horror, was depicted on
her countenance, on which might be seen, as if written in palpable
characters, a perfect frenzy of grief; not caused by feelings
of friendship, but by those of interest. Often roused by
the cries of her husband, prompt in assisting and supporting
him, she showed a lively anxiety for his sufferings, but soon
after appeared again totally absorbed in her own thoughts.
The Duchess of Burgundy also tried to console her spouse, and
found it a less difficult task than that of appearing as if she

<!-- page 105 -->

herself wanted consolation. A few tears drawn forth by the
spectacle, and often with difficulty kept up, sufficed, with the
aid of a handkerchief, to make her eyes red and swollen, and
to disfigure her face, although frequent stolen glances fell upon
all the assembly, and scrutinized separately the countenance of
each.</p>

<p>"The Duke de Beauvillier stood near them, and with a cold
and tranquil air, issued orders for the consolation of the other
princes.</p>

<p>"Madame, re-attired in full dress, entered, crying loudly,
not really recognizing anybody, but inundating all with tears
as she embraced them alternately, causing the whole ch&acirc;teau
to resound with renewed lamentations. She presented the
grotesque spectacle of a princess arrayed in full costume, in
the middle of the night, coming to mingle her tears and groans
with a crowd of women, half undressed and entirely in masquerade.</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Orleans, and some of her ladies who
regarded the event in the same light with herself, had retired
into the little cabinet, and were shut in there when I arrived.</p>

<p>"I wished still to doubt, though all revealed itself in its
true colors; but I could not make up my mind to abandon the
belief that I might hear a confirmation of the truth from some
one that I could trust. By chance I stumbled on M. D'O., to
whom I put the question, and he replied distinctly. I then
endeavored to appear as if I were not glad. I cannot tell if I
succeeded; but it is at least certain that neither grief nor joy
blunted my curiosity, and that in taking care to preserve every
appearance of decorum, I committed myself to none of the
unhappy assembly. I no longer dreaded a return of fire from
the citadel of Meudon, nor the cruel conduct of its implacable
garrison; and I restrained myself less than I did before the
king's departure for Marly, to observe at freedom this numerous
company; to cast my eyes upon the most grieved or on
those who were not grieved at all; to follow both with my
looks, and to scrutinize them with my stolen glances. It must
be confessed, that to those who are quite <i>au fait</i> to the internal

<!-- page 106 -->

machinery of a Court, the first aspect of rare events of this
kind, so interesting in their different characteristics, affords extreme
satisfaction. Every countenance speaks of the cares, the
intrigues, the labor employed to advance fortune, of the formation
and progress of cabals, of the address necessary to maintain
some and overthrow others, of the various means employed
to carry on all these schemes; of combinations more or less
advanced, of mutual repulses, coldness, hatred, and underhand
baseness; of the man&oelig;uverings, advances, management, littleness,
meanness, of some; of the overthrow of others in the
midst of their career, or when on the point of realizing their
hopes. I saw the utter consternation of those who were in
full possession of their wishes, and the blow sustained by their
opponents who were yet in expectation. I beheld the power
of that elasticity which even in such a moment could profit by
unlooked-for circumstances; I noted the extreme satisfaction
of some (and I was one of the foremost), the rage of others,
and their spiteful embarrassment in the endeavor to hide their
real feelings. I saw eyes darted round in every direction to
fathom souls under the first emotions of surprise, and under an
unlooked-for overthrow. Astonishment, disappointment, suspicion,
anxious inquiry, all were mingled and exhibited with
characteristic variety. From this living mass of contradiction,
a keen observer might extract intense enjoyment, which, however
shadowy and fleeting, is nevertheless one of the most
profitable as well as useful lessons which can be acquired in a
Court.</p>

<p>"But he," continues St. Simon, "on whom this event produced
the greatest impression, was F&eacute;nelon. How long he
had prepared his mind for this catastrophe! How near was
now his approach to a certain and complete triumph, which
burst at once, like a powerful ray of light into the abode of
darkness! Confined for twelve years to his diocese, this prelate
had grown old under the weight of hopes deferred, and
saw time roll on in unvarying uniformity, which reduced him
to despair. Always obnoxious to the king, before whom nobody
dared to pronounce his name, even on indifferent matters,

<!-- page 107 -->

and more hateful still to Madame de Maintenon, because she
had caused his ruin; . . . . more exposed than others to the
terrible cabal which had disposed of the deceased dauphin, he
had no other resource than in the unalterable attachment of
his pupil, who had also been marked as a victim by this party;
and who, according to the ordinary course of nature, was
likely to continue so, longer than his preceptor could hope to
survive. . . . . In the twinkling of an eye this pupil became
dauphin; in another, he attained to a kind of regency."</p>

<p>The whole Court, on this event, internally thought of F&eacute;nelon;
his name presented itself as a subject of remorse or hope,
for all. They believed that they saw him reign in the background,
which this unexpected and sudden death had brought
closer to their imaginations. The conduct of the king towards
his grandson, who until then had been kept in obscurity by his
grandfather, redoubled the anxiety of some, and the expectations
of others. Louis the Fourteenth one morning retained
the young prince in his cabinet at the hour of council, and
commanded all the ministers to consult with the Duke of
Burgundy whenever he summoned them, and when he did not,
they were to go of their own accord, and render him an account
of state affairs, as if they were communicating with the king
himself. "This order came like a thunderbolt upon the ministers,
who were almost all F&eacute;nelon's enemies," says the author
of the "Mysteries of the Palace." "What a fall for such
men," he adds, "to have to deal with a prince who had now
no obstacle between him and the throne, and who was clever,
enlightened, just, and of a superior understanding; who weighed
every thing conscientiously, and who, in addition to all this,
was in the strictest confidential intercourse, both mind and
heart, with F&eacute;nelon!"</p>

<p>This change was the work of Madame de Maintenon, towards
whom the young prince, by F&eacute;nelon's advice, had ever shown
a scrupulous deference, flattering to her pride, and promising
well for the future. Mingled with the death of the dauphin,
she had felt a shudder at the prospect of the future reign. To
secure eventually a prolongation of her influence, she wished

<!-- page 108 -->

to purchase the gratitude of the successor. On the day after
the funeral, she passed over to the party which until then she
had held estranged from favor. The king, who no longer
thought except as she did, appeared himself to prepare the
transition from his own tomb to the throne of his grandson.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, relieved from his hopeless state by the hand of
death, which he took for the hand of Providence, uttered a
cry of deliverance and restrained joy, to his pupil. "God," he
wrote to him, "has just struck a great blow! but his hand is
often merciful even in its severest chastisement. This unexpected
affliction is given to the world, to show to blinded men
that princes, however great they may appear, are in reality
but of trifling importance. Happy are those who have never
looked upon authority in other light than that of a trust confided
to them for the benefit of their people! Now is the time
to render yourself beloved, feared, esteemed. You must endeavor
more and more to please the king, to insinuate yourself
into his heart, that he may feel a boundless affection for you.
Watch over him and console him with all suitable assiduity
and obliging attentions. You must become the king's adviser,
the father of the people, the consoler of the oppressed, the
resource of the unfortunate, <i>the support of the nation</i>. . . . .
Discard flatterers, distinguish merit, seek it out, forestall it,
learn to bring it into action; make yourself superior to all, as
you are placed above all. . . . . You must endeavor to act as
father, not as a master. All cannot belong to one, but one
must belong to all, to promote the general happiness of the
people."</p>

<p>This direct advice of F&eacute;nelon was enforced every day by the
most intimate counsellors that he could attach to the prince, in
the persons of his two friends, the Dukes de Beauvillier and
Chevreuse.</p>

<p>"Let him undeceive the public," wrote F&eacute;nelon to them,
"respecting the little matters of scrupulous piety which they
impute to him; he may be strict as far as concerns his private
feelings, but do not let him cause them to dread a severe
reform, of which society is incapable.  He ought only to talk

<!-- page 109 -->

of that which he can carry through; no puerilities or trifling
in religion. . . . . He can better learn to govern men, by
studying them, than by studying books."</p>

<p>The palace of F&eacute;nelon, hitherto deserted, now became the
vestibule of royal favor. The courtiers and place-hunters, who
for twelve years had kept aloof as from a contagion, during his
disgrace, crowded to Cambray upon every possible pretext.
Each wished to receive the guarantee of future consideration.
He received everybody with that natural grace which caused
him to reign by anticipation in every heart, as he already in
effect occupied every thought.</p>

<p>The notes upon government which he addressed through
the Duke de Chevreuse to the dauphin, contain an entire
monarchical constitution. His political reforms had passed
from poetry into reality, but they were divested of the chimeras
which brought them into disrepute in Telemachus, and bore
the impress of maturity, reflection, and experience. The
saint had become a minister, the poet a statesman. In his
maxims were found all that has since been accomplished, attempted,
or prepared, for ameliorating the condition of the
people.</p>

<p>The term of military service was to be reduced to a period
of five years.</p>

<p>The pensions to discharged soldiers were to be distributed
among their families, to be spent in their villages, instead of
being wasted in idleness and debauchery at the Palace of the
Invalids in the capital.</p>

<p>France was never again to be engaged in a general war
against the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>There was to be a system of alliances varying with the legitimate
interests of the country.</p>

<p>A regular and public account of the receipts and expenses
of the State.</p>

<p>A fixed and registered assessment of taxes; the votes for, and
division of these subsidies, to be decided by the representatives
of the provinces.</p>

<p>There were to be provincial assemblies.</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>The suppression of the reversion and right of inheritance of
public offices.</p>

<p>The States-General of the kingdom were to be converted
into National Assemblies.</p>

<p>The nobility were to be deprived of every feudal authority
and privilege, and to be reduced to an importance derived only
from their family title.</p>

<p>The office of judge was to be gratuitous, and not hereditary.</p>

<p>The right of commerce was to be regulated; manufacturers
were to be encouraged.</p>

<p>Public pawnbrokers and savings banks were to be established.</p>

<p>All strangers who wished to become naturalized in France
were to have full liberty to do so.</p>

<p>Church property was to be rated for the benefit of the State.</p>

<p>Bishops and ministers were to be elected by their peers or
by their people.</p>

<p>There was to be perfect liberty of conscience.</p>

<p>Such were the plans of F&eacute;nelon, already prepared against
the moment when he should be called upon to become a minister.
If the Duke of Burgundy had lived, and if F&eacute;nelon had
retained the same ascendency over him which for so many
years he had maintained, 1789 would have commenced in
1716, and the reformed monarchy would only have been a
Christian republic with a supreme head.</p>

<p>But it is never permitted to one man to step in advance of a
nation. Providence was about to overturn, in the premature
grave of the prince, all the ideas, plans, virtues, dreams, ambition,
hopes, and existence of the philosopher.</p>

<p>The blast of death was upon the royal family; all fell under
it before Louis the Fourteenth, who was ready to fall with the
last. The Duchess of Burgundy, the delight of the Court, and
the joy of her husband, unexpectedly struck, brought him with
her to the grave. The blow was as sudden as it was terrible,
F&eacute;nelon had no time to prepare his heart; he learnt almost
at the same moment the illness and death of his pupil. This
pupil had become the hope of France; his reign was looked
forward to, as the revival of virtue and public happiness.

<!-- page 111 -->

F&eacute;nelon had corrected and brought to perfection in this soul,
the work roughly hewn by nature, of an accomplished prince.</p>

<p>"What a love of the truly good!" exclaims the least adulatory
of historians. "What forgetfulness of self, what purity
of intention, what proofs of divinity in this candid, simple, and
powerful mind, which, as much as is permitted to man below,
bore the impress of its sacred derivation! What sudden
bursts of thankfulness during his last agony, for his preservation
from the sceptre, and the account which he should have
had to render of its use! What ardent love of God! what a
lowly opinion of his own insignificance! what a magnificent
idea of the infinity of mercy! what a modified confidence!
what profound peace! what invincible patience! what sweetness!
what pure charity, which made him desire to be with his
Creator! France at last sinks under this heavy chastisement.
God showed her a prince that she did not deserve: the earth
'was unworthy of him!' . . . ."</p>

<p>This prince, his virtues, his holiness, the hopes revealed and
then withdrawn, all were the work of F&eacute;nelon. The master
had expired with the disciple; F&eacute;nelon died with the Duke of
Burgundy.</p>

<p>He only allowed a few words to escape him. "All my ties
are broken: there is no longer any thing to bind me to the
earth!" His life from that moment was rendered desolate; he
had lost its aim: this reign, of which he had dreamt, as a boon
to the human race, was buried with the Germanicus of France.
"He has shown him to the world, and he has taken him
away," wrote he several weeks after to the Duke de Chevreuse,
the confidant of his grief. "I am struck with horror, and ill
without a malady, from the shock. In weeping for the dead
prince, I mourn for the survivors. The king must make
peace. What will be our fate, if we should fall into the troubles
of a minority? Without a mother! without a regent! an
unfortunate war abroad, and all resources exhausted at home!
. . . . I would give my life not only for the State, but for the
children of our dear prince, who is dearer to me now than
when he was spared to us."  He urgently entreated the Duke

<!-- page 112 -->

de Beauvillier to impress on Madame de Maintenon the urgent
necessity that the king should form a council of government,
at the head of which his most virtuous friends should preside.
"I expect but little," said he, "from this superannuated favorite,
full of the anger, jealousy, littleness, dislikes, spite, and artfulness
common to women; but God makes use of many implements."
He conjured the Duke de Chevreuse not to refuse,
from ill-timed modesty, to become one of the council of
regency. This government, composed of those whom he had
for so many years inspired, would still have been that of the
Duke of Burgundy. F&eacute;nelon pursued the dream of his life,
for the happiness of the nation, even to the sepulchre of the
prince for whom he had conceived it, and wished him to reign
even after his death. In this thought, which actuated him to
the end, he trembled lest the king should discover among the
papers of the Duke of Burgundy a writing which would
appear to him a more unpardonable crime than "Telemachus."
This was entitled, "A Guide for the Conscience of a King,"&mdash;a
code of piety, toleration, and of duty towards the people,
every line of which was an accusation against the egotism,
persecutions, and unprofitable personal glory of Louis the
Fourteenth. But the friends of F&eacute;nelon had removed this
manuscript from the papers of the king's grandson.</p>

<p>The death of F&eacute;nelon's two intimates, the Duke de Chevreuse
and the Duke de Beauvillier, caused this last chimera of
the public good to fade into nothing; the holy ambition of
their friend died with them. F&eacute;nelon turned his thoughts
from the decline and misfortunes of the reign about to end,
and fixed them solely on things immortal. His writings and
correspondence at this time bear the impress of that melancholy,
which, in worldly men, shows the disappointment of a
mistaken life, and in religious minds the transfer of their hopes
from earth to heaven. He wrote, as Socrates in his last hour
discoursed, upon the immortality of the soul. Friendship still
remained, but he lost much by the death of the Abb&eacute; de
Langeron, the pupil, confidant, and support of his heart
through all his varying fortunes.  The Abb&eacute; de Langeron

<!-- page 113 -->

expired in the arms of his master. "Alas! I have not the
strength you suppose," wrote F&eacute;nelon to a mutual friend who
congratulated him upon not allowing his pious feelings to be
disturbed by the grief of human separations; "I confess that
I have wept for myself while weeping for my friend. I feel a
sort of internal languor, and can only derive consolation by
giving way to the lassitude of my sorrow. Our dear departed
friend died with an enlightened and consoling view of his
end, that would have affected you deeply. Even when his
ideas became a little clouded, his sentiments expressed hope,
patience, and entire submission to the will of God. I tell you
all this that I may not trouble you with my distress, without,
at the same time, showing you the comfort which faith affords
in grief, of which St. Augustin speaks, and which God has
upon this occasion permitted me to feel. God has done as he
thinks best; he has preferred the happiness of my friend to
my earthly consolation. I offered up him whom I trembled
to lose! . . . ."</p>

<p>"I live no longer but for friendship," exclaimed he afterwards,
in reverting to this loss, "and friendship will cause my
death. But we shall soon regain what we appear to have lost;
in a little time there will be no longer cause to weep."</p>

<p>A fever caused by his distress of mind seized him on New-Year's
day, 1715, and in six days after consumed the small
portion of vitality which years, labor, and grief had spared in
that heart which had been devoted to the cause of humanity.
He died as a saint and a poet, causing to be read aloud to
him from the sacred Canticles, the most sublime and soothing
hymns, which carried at the same time his soul and imagination
to heaven. "Repeat that passage again," said he to his
reader, delighted with the songs of hope. "Again, again! I
can never hear enough of these divine words!" cried he when
they were silent, thinking that he slept. His desire for this
foretaste of immortality was insatiable. "Lord," he once exclaimed,
"if I am still necessary to thy people, I refuse not to
labor for the rest of my days. Thy will be done!" These
words afflicted those present, and the Abb&eacute; de Chant&eacute;rac, his

<!-- page 114 -->

first and last friend, said to him, "But why do you leave us?
In this desolation to whom will you confide us? Perhaps
ferocious beasts may come and devour your little flock." He
replied only by a tender look and a sigh. He expired gently
on the following morning, with a resignation which appeared
like joy, surrounded by the prayers and affectionate offices of
his weeping attendants.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; de Chant&eacute;rac, as if he had nothing more to do
on earth after the death of him for whom he had solely lived,
expired of grief after the funeral of his friend. All France
mourned in her soul for the loss of her saint and poet. Louis
the Fourteenth himself appeared to discover at last, but when
it was too late, that a mighty mind was wanting to his empire,
and a great sustaining force to his old age. "Here was
a man," he exclaimed, "who would have served us well under
the disasters by which my kingdom is about to be assailed!"
Vain posthumous regret, which appreciates not genius until
it is extinct, nor virtue until buried in the tomb!</p>

<p>Such was the life and death of F&eacute;nelon. His name has
become even more popular and immortal than his works, because
the perfections of his soul exceeded those of his genius;
adored for himself alone, his name is his immortality. Men
are more just in their retribution than is generally believed.
It was the nature of F&eacute;nelon to love; it was his glory to be
beloved. Of all the great men of this grand age of Louis
the Fourteenth, not one has left the recollection of so gentle a
ministry. There is a tenderness in the accent of all when speaking
of him, which describes the individual man. His poetry
enchants our infancy, his religion breathes the gentleness of
the lamb, the emblem of Christ; even his political doctrines
show only the errors and illusions of mistaken love; and his
whole life is the poetic history of a good man struggling with
the impossibilities of the times.</p>

<p>It has been said that he has not worked out the good which
he intended.  He has done better: he has originated the idea;
he has in thought applied the Gospel to society; he desired
to see the reign of heaven upon earth; he taught kings the

<!-- page 115 -->

sacred rights of man, while he showed the people the duties
of subjects. He thirsted for Christian equality, regulated
liberty, justice, morality, and charity, in the dealings of the
government with the people, and of the people with the government;
he was the tribune of virtue, and the prophet of
social improvement; he has expanded his own soul over the
souls of two centuries; sometimes the poet of imagination,
but always the poet of charity, he has softened and Christianized
the genius of France. Conscience owes him an additional
virtue&mdash;toleration; thrones, another duty&mdash;the love of the
people; republics, an added glory&mdash;humanity. France has
possessed bolder natures, but she has given us none so full of
tenderness. If genius acknowledged a sex, it might be said
that F&eacute;nelon had the imagination of a woman to dream of
heaven, and her soul to love the earth. When we pronounce
his name, or open his book, we fancy that we look on his face,
and persuade ourselves that we hear the voice of a friend.
What quality of fame can surpass this love in veneration and
solid value?</p>

<p>The epitaph of F&eacute;nelon might be written in these words:</p>

<p>"There are men who have made France more feared or
renowned, but none have rendered her more beloved by other
nations."</p>

<p>F&Eacute;NELON, Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac de Lamotte, of an ancient
and illustrious family, was born at the <i>Ch&acirc;teau de F&eacute;nelon</i>, in
Perigord, August 6, 1651. Under the eyes of a virtuous
father, he pursued his literary studies with equal success and
rapidity; and nurtured from childhood in classical antiquity,
educated in solitude among the models of Greece, his noble
and delicate taste appeared at the same time with his happy
genius. Called to Paris by his uncle, the Marquis de F&eacute;nelon,
in order to complete his philosophic studies and commence
the course of theology necessary for his destined vocation, he
underwent, at fifteen years of age, the same trial as Bossuet,
and preached before an auditory less celebrated, in truth, than
that of the Hotel de Rambouillet, yet highly distinguished.
This splendor of a premature reputation alarmed the Marquis
de F&eacute;nelon, who, in order to remove the young man from the
seductions of the world and of self-love, sent him to the seminary
of St. Sulpice. In this retreat, F&eacute;nelon was penetrated
with the evangelical spirit, and merited the friendship of a
virtuous man, M. Tronson, Superior of St. Sulpice. Here he
received holy orders.</p>

<p>It was then that his religious fervor inspired him with the
design of consecrating himself to the missions of Canada.

<!-- page 118 -->

Crossed in his project by the fears of his family and the feebleness
of his constitution, he soon turned his attention towards
the missions of the Levant, towards Greece, where the profane
and the sacred, where St. Paul and Socrates, where the
Church of Corinth, the Parthenon and Parnassus, invited his
poetic and religious imagination. Enchanted by the <i>souvenirs</i>
of Athens, he was indignant at the thought that the native
land of letters and glory should be the prey of barbarian
"When shall I see," he wrote, "the blood of the Persians
mingling itself with that of the Turks on the fields of Marathon,
in order to give Greece wholly to religion, to philosophy,
to art, which re-claim her as their native land!" The enthusiasm
of the young apostle, however, gave way to graver considerations.
F&eacute;nelon, diverted from these foreign missions,
devoted himself wholly to an apostleship which he did not
believe less useful&mdash;to the instruction of the '<i>Nouvelles Catholiques</i>,'
the newly converted women in Paris. The duties and
the cares of this employment, in which he buried his genius
during ten years, prepared him for the composition of his first
work,&mdash;the <i>Treatise on the Education of Girls</i><sup id="cr02_ref001"><a href="#cr02_en001">1</a></sup>, a masterpiece
of delicacy and of reason, which the author of <i>Emile</i> and
painter of <i>Sophie</i> has not surpassed. This work was designed
for the Duchess de Beauvilliers, the pious and wise mother of
a numerous family. F&eacute;nelon, in the modest obscurity of his
ministry, already enjoyed with the Dukes de Beauvilliers and
de Chevreuse that virtuous friendship which was equally proof
against favor and disgrace, the court and exile.</p>

<p>He had found in Bossuet an attachment that was to be less
durable. Admitted to the familiarity of this great man, he
studied his genius and his life. The example of Bossuet,
whose wholly polemical religion was employed upon controversies
and conversions, doubtless inspired F&eacute;nelon with the
<i>Trait&eacute; du minist&egrave;re des pasteurs</i>,<sup id="cr02_ref002"><a href="#cr02_en002">2</a></sup> a work in which he combated
heretics with more moderation than his illustrious model
exhibited. The subject, the merit of the work, and the all-powerful

<!-- page 119 -->

influence of Bossuet led Louis XIV. to confide to
F&eacute;nelon the care of a new mission in Poitou. The rigorous
uniformity which Louis XIV. wished to extend over all the
consciences of his kingdom, and the resistance that sprang
from oppression, often obliged the monarch to have his missionaries
sustained by soldiers. F&eacute;nelon did not limit himself
to absolutely rejecting the odious assistance of dragoons; he
reserved to himself the choice of ecclesiastical colleagues who
should participate in a ministry of persuasion and gentleness.
He converted without persecuting, and made the belief whose
apostle he was, an object of love.</p>

<p>The importance then attached to such missions attracted,
more than ever, attention to F&eacute;nelon, who happily acquitted
himself of his task. A great object then presented itself to
ambition and talent. The dauphin, the grandson of Louis
XIV., was no longer a child; and the king was seeking a
person to whose hands he should confide this precious deposit.<sup id="cr02_ref003"><a href="#cr02_en003">3</a></sup>
Virtue, aided by the favor of Madame de Maintenon, obtained
the preference. M. de Beauvilliers was named governor; and
he chose F&eacute;nelon, with the consent of the king, as preceptor
of the young prince. These virtuous friends, seconded by the
cares of some men worthy of imitating them, commenced the
noble task of educating a king. History attests that never
was there seen a more perfect co-operation of wills and efforts.
F&eacute;nelon, by the natural superiority of his genius, was the soul
of this re-union. It was he who, transported by the hope of
some day placing virtue upon the throne, and seeing the happiness
of France in the education of her king, destroyed with
an admirable art all the dangerous germs that nature and the
premature sentiment of power had implanted in that young
heart, and made the defects of a stubborn character yield to
the habit of most salutary virtues. This education, whose
immortal monuments remain to us in the writings of F&eacute;nelon
would seem the masterpiece of genius consecrating itself to
the happiness of men.</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>F&eacute;nelon, brought into the midst of the Court, and only half
giving himself up to it, made himself admired by the graces of
a brilliant and facile mind, by the charm of the noblest and
most eloquent conversation. There was in him something of
the seducing and the inspired. Imagination, genius, escaped
him on all sides; and the most elegant politeness adorned the
ascendency of genius, and made it pardoned. This personal
superiority excited much more admiration than the small
number of works that he had produced. He was praised on
this account at the period of his reception into the Academy;
and, a little time afterwards, La Bruy&egrave;re painted him still
under the same traits, recognizable by all contemporaries.
"One feels," he said, "the force and the ascendency of that
rare spirit, whether he preaches from his genius and without
preparation, whether he pronounces a studied and oratorical
discourse, or explains his thoughts in conversation,&mdash;always
master of the ear and heart of those who listen to him, he does
not allow them to envy so much elevation, so much facility,
delicacy, and politeness."</p>

<p>This ascendency of virtue, grace, and genius, which excited
in the hearts of F&eacute;nelon's friends a tenderness mixed
with enthusiasm, which had won Madame de Maintenon, in
spite of her mistrust and reserve, were unavailing against
the prepossessions of Louis XIV. This prince doubtless esteemed
the man to whom he confided the education of his
grandson; but he never had any liking for him. It has been
thought, that the brilliant and facile eloquence of F&eacute;nelon disturbed
a monarch who was displeased with any sort of pre-eminence
except his own. But, if we look at a letter in which
F&eacute;nelon, in the overflow of confidence, informed Madame de
Maintenon that Louis XIV. had no idea of his duties as a
king, it will be easily supposed that an opinion so severe,
with which F&eacute;nelon seems to have been too deeply penetrated
never to have let some indiscreet revelation of it escape him,
could not remain wholly unknown to a monarch accustomed
to praise, and who could be offended at a less severe judgment.
History has not participated in the extreme rigor of this opinion

<!-- page 121 -->

upon a prince who, in the exercise of a power in truth
absolute, always bore about him propriety and grandeur,
and preserved honor under despotism&mdash;his greatest enemy.
F&eacute;nelon had preserved at Court the most irreproachable disinterestedness.
He spent five years there, in the prominent
place of preceptor to the dauphin, without asking, without
receiving any favor. Louis XIV., who knew how to reward
nobly and appropriately, desired to repair this oversight,
and named F&eacute;nelon to the Archbishopric of Cambray.<sup id="cr02_ref004"><a href="#cr02_en004">4</a></sup> This
moment of favor and prosperity was that in which F&eacute;nelon
was destined to receive a blow that would have mortally
wounded a less inviolable reputation.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, whose natural temperament led him to cherish a
lively and spiritual devotion, had for some time fancied that
he recognized a part of his principles in the mouth of a pious
and insane woman, who doubtless had much persuasion and
talent, since she obtained an extraordinary influence over several
superior minds. Madame Guyon, writing and dogmatizing
upon grace and pure love, at first persecuted and arrested, soon
afterwards admitted into the intimate society of the Duke de
Beauvilliers, received by Madame de Maintenon, authorized to
disseminate her doctrines in Saint-Cyr, then suspected by Bossuet,
arrested anew, interrogated and condemned, was the pretext
of F&eacute;nelon's disgrace. The inexorable Bossuet did not
relish the mystic subtleties, the refinements of divine love, with
which the lively and tender imagination of F&eacute;nelon was too
easily captivated. Bossuet wished to have the new Archbishop
of Cambray himself condemn the errors of a woman
whose friend he had been. F&eacute;nelon refused through conscience
and delicacy, fearing to compromise opinions that were dear
to him; wishing to deal gently with an unfortunate woman,
who appeared to him only culpable of excess in the love of
God. Perhaps, in fine&mdash;for he was human&mdash;he was shocked
by the theological <i>hauteur</i> of Bossuet, who pressed him as if
he had wished to convert him.</p>

<!-- page 122 -->

<p>F&eacute;nelon published that too famous book, of <i>the Maxims of
the Saints</i>,<sup id="cr02_ref005"><a href="#cr02_en005">5</a></sup> which may be regarded as an indirect apology, or
even as a softened exposition (<i>r&eacute;daction att&eacute;nuante</i>), of Madame
Guyon's principles. In an age when a religious opinion was a
political event, the first appearance of this work excited much
astonishment and many murmurs. All those who could be
secretly jealous of the rank and genius of F&eacute;nelon, declared
themselves against the errors of his theology. Elevated above
any mean sentiment, but inflexible, impatient of contradiction,
negligent of mundane regards and proprieties when he believed
religion compromised, Bossuet himself denounced to
Louis XIV. in the midst of his Court, the heresy of the new
archbishop. At the moment when F&eacute;nelon received this
weighty blow, the burning of his palace at Cambray, the loss
of his library, of his manuscripts, of his papers, put his soul to
a new proof, and wrung from him no other complaint than
these words, so touching, and in his mouth so true: "It is
better that my mansion should be burned than the cottage of
a poor laborer."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bossuet, committed by the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of his first
declaration, prepared himself to pursue his rival, and seemed
eager to wring from him a recantation. The admirer and
friend of F&eacute;nelon, Madame de Maintenon, separated herself
from him with an inconceivable coldness. F&eacute;nelon submitted
his book to the judgment of the Holy See. Bossuet had already
composed remarks, in which the bitterest and most vehement
censure was coupled with pompous expressions of
regret and friendship. He proposed at the same time a
conference, which F&eacute;nelon refused, preferring to defend his
book at the tribunal of Rome. It was then that he received
orders to quit the Court, and retire into his diocese. News of
this excited in the soul of the Duke of Burgundy a grief that
was the eulogy of the education of that young prince. The
cabal had wished to profit by the fall of F&eacute;nelon, in order to
overturn the Duke de Beauvilliers; he was saved by the force

<!-- page 123 -->

of virtue, and his very devotion to the cause of an unfortunate
friend interested the generosity of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>In spite of the manifest wish of this prince, the court of
Rome hesitated to condemn an archbishop so illustrious as
F&eacute;nelon. This delay and this repugnance, which honored
Pope Innocent VIII., gave scope to the talent of the accuser
and the accused; and while the judges were deliberating, the
writings of the two adversaries succeeded each other with
prodigious rapidity. The struggle changed its object. After
having exhausted dogma, Bossuet threw himself back upon
facts; and his account of quietism, wittily and sharply written,
seemed destined to fasten upon F&eacute;nelon himself a part of the
ridicule inseparable from Madame Guyon. The Abb&eacute; Bossuet,
unworthy nephew of Bossuet, carried personal accusations still
further; and, collecting the most odious rumors, he sought to
tarnish the purity of F&eacute;nelon. Never did the indignation of
a virtuous and calumniated soul show itself more eloquent.
F&eacute;nelon, in an apology, demolished these vile accusations; and
new letters from Louis XIV., written by Bossuet, new intrigues,
and even threats, were necessary, in order to wring from the
court of Rome a condemnation, which was even softened in
form and expression. The interest of this controversy, so foreign
to the ideas of our age, is perfectly preserved in the
excellent history of F&eacute;nelon, by M. de Bausset; and in this
work one will find an animated picture of the court of Rome
and the court of France, which took a lively interest in this
frivolous question, to which importance was given by the opinions
of the times, and by the prodigious talent of the two
rivals.</p>

<p>The long and glorious resistance of the Archbishop of Cambray
had still further sharpened the resentment of Louis XIV.;
and the hesitation of the Pope to condemn F&eacute;nelon<sup id="cr02_ref006"><a href="#cr02_en006">6</a></sup> rendered

<!-- page 124 -->

his disgrace with the Court more irreconcilable than ever.
When the brief so long deferred, obtained by so much discussion
and intrigue, finally appeared [1699], F&eacute;nelon hastened to
subscribe it, and to condemn himself by a most touching and
simple mandatory letter, in which Bossuet did not fail to find
much parade and ambiguity. The modest submission of F&eacute;nelon,
his silence, his episcopal virtues, and the admiration
which they inspired, would not, doubtless, have reopened to
him the entrance of the court of Louis XIV., but an unexpected
event more than ever irritated the monarch.</p>

<p>"Telemachus," composed some years before, at the period of
F&eacute;nelon's favor, was published, some months after the affair of
quietism, by the infidelity of a domestic charged with transcribing
the manuscript. The work, suppressed in France, was
reproduced by the presses of Holland, and obtained in all
Europe a success that malignity rendered injurious to Louis
XIV., by seeking in it allusions to the conquests and misfortunes
of his reign. This prince, who had never liked the
political ideas of F&eacute;nelon, and long since had called him a
chimerical <i>bel esprit</i>, regarded the author of "Telemachus" as a
detractor from his glory, who added the wrong of ingratitude
to the injustice of satire. F&eacute;nelon in his dying hour protested
his respect for the person and the virtues of Louis XIV. This
formal testimony, compared with the severe judgment that
F&eacute;nelon expressed in the letter of which we have already
spoken, allows of only one explanation that respects his glory
and truth. This sensible and virtuous man, preoccupied with
the misfortunes that were mingled with the splendor of the
reign of Louis XIV., unconsciously transferred to a work of
imagination some traits of a picture which he had before his
eyes, and which often afflicted his soul. How could he have
helped it? How could he have spoken of peoples and kings
without making allusions to contemporaries? The circle of
human calamities and faults is more limited than it is supposed.
There will be vices as long as there shall be men, says
Tacitus; and as long as there shall be vices, the history of
past times will appear to be the satire of the present.</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>"Telemachus" doubtless offers some reflections that can be
distorted against Louis XIV., but it is an absurd injustice to
search in this work for the allegorical and premeditated censure
of this great king. It was even impossible to have better
combined all the materials, in order to disconcert allusions, and
as much as possible escape the inevitable fatality of resemblances.
We believe that this generous precaution occupied
the mind of F&eacute;nelon while composing his works, and that,
writing for the happiness of peoples, he selected that poetic
conception, those primitive manners, those antique societies, so
remote from the picture of modern Europe. Why, moreover,
should he have wished to paint Louis XIV. under the traits of
the imprudent Idomeneus, or the sacrilegious Adrastus, rather
than under the image of the sage and victorious Sesostris? But
no; these different images are the plays of an imagination that
seeks to multiply interesting contrasts,&mdash;no one, in particular,
is the satirical portrait of the great king, whose reign formed
the most beautiful epoch of modern Europe. F&eacute;nelon soon
learned the indelible impression produced by "Telemachus"
upon the heart of the king; he appeared to resign himself to
his separation from the Court, which he sometimes had the
weakness to call his disgrace, as if the prolonged sojourn of an
archbishop in the midst of his flock, that he enlightens and
sanctifies, could ever be associated in thought with humiliation
and misfortune. Besides, if F&eacute;nelon sometimes recollected
with bitterness the court of Louis XIV., he must have been
consoled by the happiness that he diffused around him in his
retreat at Cambray. The sanctity of the ancient bishops, the
severity of the primitive church, the sweetness of the most
indulgent virtue, the charm of the most captivating politeness,
eagerness to fulfil the humblest duties of the holy ministry,
indefatigable goodness, exhaustless charity,&mdash;such are the traits
attributed to F&eacute;nelon by an eloquent and virtuous bishop, who
was entitled to dwell long upon the image of that illustrious
man. The first care of F&eacute;nelon was to instruct the clergy of
a seminary which he had founded. He did not even disdain to
teach their catechism to the children of his diocese.  Like the

<!-- page 126 -->

bishops of ancient days, he often ascended the pulpit of his
church, and giving himself up to his heart and his faith, he
spoke without preparation, diffusing all the treasures of his
facile genius.</p>

<p>An unforeseen occasion allowed him to develope with more
labor his natural eloquence. The sermon which he pronounced
in the cathedral of Lille, for the consecration of the
Archbishop of Cologne, is one of the most touching and most
perfect pieces of Christian eloquence. The misfortunes of war,
which finally chastised the ambition of Louis XIV., had
brought hostile troops into the diocese of F&eacute;nelon: this was
for the holy bishop the occasion of new efforts and new sacrifices.
His wisdom, his firmness, his nobility of language,
inspired the hostile generals with a salutary respect for the
unfortunate provinces of Flanders. Eugene was worthy of listening
to the voice of the great man, whose genius he appreciated.<sup id="cr02_ref007"><a href="#cr02_en007">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In the midst of so many cares and labors, F&eacute;nelon kept up a
very extensive correspondence with the ecclesiastics who consulted
him, with his friends, and his relatives. In his correspondence
is always recognized that happy and facile genius, to
which wise and noble ideas upon all subjects are perfectly natural.
Several of his letters contain all the secrets of the
knowledge of the world, analyzed with the delicacy of a courtier,
and expressed in the style of La Bruy&egrave;re, writing without
effort. The situation of Cambray, on the frontiers of France,
attracted about F&eacute;nelon many strangers, none of whom approached
or left him without being penetrated with a religious
admiration.  To say nothing of Ramsay, who spent several

<!-- page 127 -->

years in the palace of F&eacute;nelon, the famous Marshal Munich,
and the unfortunate James III.,<sup id="cr02_ref008"><a href="#cr02_en008">8</a></sup> felt the charm of his conversation,
and the ascendency of his high wisdom. It was the
privilege of F&eacute;nelon to appear equally admirable to the eyes
of a priest, of a politician, or of a warrior,&mdash;an advantage in
truth more easy to conceive, at an epoch when religion and
ethics formed a common tie that united minds.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon, in the wise counsels which he gave to James III.,
showed his high esteem for the English constitution, so strong
at once against despotism and anarchy. He was exempt from
that narrow patriotism which undervalues every thing that
exists beyond the frontiers. His virtuous soul felt the need of
going forth into the world, and of seeking the happiness of
men. "I love," he said, "my family better than myself; I
love my country better than my family; I love mankind better
than my country." Admirable progression of sentiments
and duties! False and perverse spirits have abused this principle;
it nevertheless was worthy of being sanctioned by F&eacute;nelon:
it is the <i>caritas generis humani</i> that gushed from the
soul of Cicero, but was contradicted by the ferocious conquests
of the Romans, who, not less inconsistent than barbarous,
enjoyed the wounds and the death of their gladiators in the
same theatre where they applauded with transport this verse,
more human than patriotic:</p>

<p class="center">"Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto."</p>

<p>Christianity was worthy of consecrating, by the mouth of
F&eacute;nelon, a maxim that nature has put in the heart of man.
The humanity of F&eacute;nelon did not limit itself to exaggerated
speculations&mdash;to impracticable generalities, which imply ignorance
of the details of human affairs. His politics were not
simply the dream of a virtuous soul. He had seen and judged
the court and men; he knew the history of all ages; he was
endowed with a certain independence of mind, which placed
him above the prejudices of state and nation.  It is in the

<!-- page 128 -->

different memoirs which he addressed to the Duke de Beauvilliers,
that may be studied the wisdom of his views upon the
greatest interests, upon the succession of Spain, upon the
policy proper for Philip V., upon the allies, upon the conduct
of the war, upon the necessity of peace. Greatly to be desired
is the publication of these precious writings, which are
known only by the extracts given by F&eacute;nelon's last historian.
That disastrous war of the Spanish succession, in bringing the
theatre of combat near the residence of F&eacute;nelon, gave him the
joy of seeing, after ten years of absence, the young prince whom
he had formed, who had just taken command of the last troops
of the vanquished Louis XIV. It cannot be disguised, however,
that the pupil of F&eacute;nelon, in the commanding of armies,
was below the promise of his youth and the opinion of France.
The letters of F&eacute;nelon to the Duke of Burgundy, during this
decisive period, while showing the severe frankness, the singular
ascendency of the tutor, would themselves give rise to the
suspicion that this young prince,&mdash;instructed, docile, virtuous,&mdash;had
a genius too timid. One is not pleased that the heir of
Louis XIV. needs to receive lessons upon all the details of his
conduct. In spite of the respect that even the minuti&aelig; of
virtue deserve, one is not pleased that a young prince placed
upon so great a stage, occupied with interests so important,
should be disquieted and consult F&eacute;nelon, in order to know
whether, in the movement of war, he could remain for some
hours within the walls of a convent. One fears that such disquietudes
may have left little place for great ideas, and that the
education of the dauphin may, in some respects, have diminished
his soul, in order the better to subdue it. F&eacute;nelon, it is
true, always speaks to his pupil the language of an active and
enlightened policy. But, when he reproaches him with a love
of solitude and contemplation, a trifling piety, and a misplaced
humility, it is difficult to believe that these defects, which
seem so opposed to the impetuous childhood of the Duke of
Burgundy, may not, in part, be the result of education upon
a soul which had more ardor than light; which, too much subdued
by religion, converted all its force into mildness and

<!-- page 129 -->

virtue. In the letters of F&eacute;nelon to his virtuous pupil, we find
severe judgments upon all the generals that then formed the
hope of France. It may be remarked, in this regard, that
F&eacute;nelon had much sweetness in character, and much domination
in spirit. His ideas were absolute and decisive,&mdash;a habit
that seems to pertain to promptness and force of mind. The
continual attention that F&eacute;nelon paid to the political interests
of France, did not in the least diminish his zeal for the affairs of
religion and the Church. Those who particularly honor F&eacute;nelon
as a philosopher will, perhaps, be astonished to see him
entering into all ecclesiastical discussions with as much ardor
as Bossuet himself. But if F&eacute;nelon had not been, before all,
what he ought to have been by conscience and condition,
bishop and theologian, he would merit less esteem; he would
have lacked the leading characteristic of the century in which
he lived&mdash;the sentiment of propriety and duty. When the
unfortunate disputes of Jansenism were revived, after a long
interruption, F&eacute;nelon wrote against the men who did not imitate
his respect for the court of Rome; and he soon found
himself engaged in a controversy that was scarcely briefer
and less earnest than that of <i>pure love</i>. The courtiers, on
this account, supposed in F&eacute;nelon views of ambition and
flattery. If F&eacute;nelon had wished to gain the heart of the king,
he employed at the same period a nobler way, by feeding, at
his own expense, the French army during the disastrous winter
of 1709; but he no more sought on this occasion than on the
other to overcome unconquerable prejudices. He served religion
and his country. The following year, the same sentiments inspired
him with the eloquent picture of the ills of France, and
the project of associating the nation with the government,&mdash;the
proposition for convoking an assembly of the notables. This
memoir is of the highest interest. F&eacute;nelon therein admirably
judges of the force and the weakness of despotism, and the
salutary power of liberty. We can scarcely conceive that
this generous and provident policy, which anticipated the
opinion of Europe, should have attracted on F&eacute;nelon reproach
and hatred, even in the middle of our century. If it were for

<!-- page 130 -->

this reason that the name of philosopher has been given to the
most religious of bishops, F&eacute;nelon would disavow neither his
panegyrists nor his accusers; and, for having desired happiness
and liberty for nations, he would not believe himself less
a Christian. The memoirs that F&eacute;nelon addressed to the
Duke de Beauvilliers, were the prayer of a sage zealous for
his country, but without the power to serve her. An unexpected
event gave a glimpse of the moment when the counsels
of F&eacute;nelon might govern France. The grand dauphin died,
and the Duke of Burgundy, long oppressed by the mediocrity
of his father, saw himself suddenly approaching the throne,
whose heir he was, and the king, of whom he became the
confidant and the support. His virtues, freed from a jealous
tutelage, finally had scope for action. What joy must the
virtuous tutor have felt, on seeing his work ready to be justified
by the happiness of his country! Then, full of hope, he wrote
to his pupil, who, according to the expression of Saint-Simon,
reigned in advance: "It is not necessary that all should exist
for one alone; but one alone ought to exist for all, to make
their happiness." He communicated at the same time to
the Duke de Beauvilliers different plans of administration
and government, that ought to be proposed to the young
prince.</p>

<p>While F&eacute;nelon was preparing the reign of his pupil, sudden
death removed the heir of the old king, who remained immovably
firm in the midst of all the humiliations of his glory, and
all the disasters of his family. Thus ended the hopes of virtue:
nevertheless, F&eacute;nelon, in spite of his grief, did not abandon
the love of his country, even when he no longer saw between
her and him the young prince whom he had trained up
for her. Anxious for France, whose destiny rested upon a
monarch of seventy-six and an infant in the cradle, he wished
to prevent the ills of a long minority. In several confidential
memoirs which he wrote upon that subject, we recognize the
novelty of his political views, and that spirit of liberty which,
in his century, was not the least of its innovations. One of
these papers is devoted to a discussion of the suspicions that

<!-- page 131 -->

accused the Duke of Orleans of a most frightful crime, and of
an ambition eager to commit another. When we have read
this memoir, whose author, without admitting the popular reports
in all their horror, severely judges the scandals and vices
of the Duke of Orleans, we feel some surprise at seeing F&eacute;nelon
keeping up with this prince a philosophic correspondence.
Doubtless F&eacute;nelon hoped to overcome, by virtue and
truth, a soul abandoned to all vices, but incapable of a crime.
It is Plato writing to Dionysius; and the resemblance is so
much the more true, as, setting aside revealed religion, F&eacute;nelon
endeavors, before all, to prove the principles of natural
religion,&mdash;principles ordinarily feeble and ill-established in a
heart that has lost all others, but to which his luminous and
simple genius lends a form that must have astonished the frivolous
incredulity of the Duke of Orleans. Such a discussion
will appear, in our century, much more worthy of F&eacute;nelon
than the theological debates in which the bull <i>Unigenitus</i> engaged
him, near the close of his life. But this great man,
faithful before all to his episcopal character, saw for himself no
task more noble than that of combating opinions which
troubled the consciences of men and disturbed the repose of
the Church.</p>

<p>Malignity supposed that the zeal of F&eacute;nelon was animated
by an old spite against the Cardinal de Noailles. But when
the conduct of a virtuous man is authorized by his duty, it
must not be explained by his weaknesses. It was to these abstract
and difficult discussions that F&eacute;nelon devoted the last
days of a life suffering and made desolate by mourning. This
man, so sensitive to earthly friendships, and who desired that
all good friends might die together, lost, at short intervals,
nearly all those whom he loved. While, afflicted with several
successive losses, he was writing&mdash;"I no longer see aught but
friendship, and it will be friendship that will make me die&mdash;"
death took from him the Duke de Beauvilliers: he died himself
four months afterwards, at the age of sixty-four years (January
7, 1715). A light fall hastened the wished-for moment.
His death, like his life, was that of a great and virtuous bishop.</p>

<!-- page 132 -->

<p>Although F&eacute;nelon wrote much, he never appeared to seek
fame as an author. All his works were inspired by the duties
of his station, by his own misfortunes, or those of his country.
Most of them escaped his hands without his knowledge, and
were known only after his death. Some sermons&mdash;the first
essay of his youth&mdash;have been preserved. The composition is
not strong and elaborate, as in the masterpieces of the great
pulpit orators; but in them reigns an amiable enthusiasm for
religion and virtue, a facile and vivid imagination, a natural,
harmonious, and poetical elegance. They are brilliant sketches
traced by a happy genius, that uses little effort. Nevertheless,
F&eacute;nelon had reflected much upon oratorial art and pulpit eloquence;
and his studies, in this regard, are found in three
dialogues, in the manner of Plato, filled with arguments borrowed
from that philosopher, and above all, written with a
grace that seems to have been stolen from him. We have in
our language no treatise on oratorical art that contains more
sound, ingenious, and new ideas, and a severer and bolder impartiality
in judgments. The style is simple, agreeable, varied,
fitly eloquent, and mingled with that delicate vivacity with
which the ancients knew how to temper didactic severity.
This production belongs to the youth of F&eacute;nelon: in it one
everywhere feels that exquisite taste for simplicity, that love
for <i>na&iuml;ve</i> beauty, which constitutes the inimitable character of
his writings. The <i>Letter on Eloquence</i>,<sup id="cr02_ref009"><a href="#cr02_en009">9</a></sup> written towards the
close of his life, contains only the same doctrine, applied with
more extent, ornamented with new developments, everywhere
enounced with the mild and persuasive authority of a man of
genius growing old, who discusses little, remembers, and judges;
no shorter piece of composition presents a richer and happier
choice of souvenirs and examples. F&eacute;nelon cites them with
eloquence, because they come from his soul rather than from
his memory. But, among so many beauties, he returns to those
that are calmest, most natural, most <i>na&iuml;ve</i>; and then, in order
to express what he feels, he has words of an inimitable grace.</p>

F&eacute;nelon in the first rank among critics, and serve to explain
the original simplicity of his own writings, and the composition,
so antique and so new, of "Telemachus." F&eacute;nelon, charmed
with the beauties of Virgil and Homer, searches in them for
those traits of a <i>na&iuml;ve</i> and passionate truth, which he found
especially in Homer, and which he himself calls <i>that amiable
simplicity of a new-born world</i>. The Greeks appear to him
nearer that first epoch, and he prefers to study and imitate
them; Homer, Xenophon, and Plato inspired him with "Telemachus."
One would be deceived in believing that F&eacute;nelon
is indebted to Greece for nothing but the charm of Homer's
fictions: the idea of moral beauty in the education of a young
prince, those philosophic conversations, those proofs of courage,
of patience, of humanity in war, respect for oaths,&mdash;all these
beneficent ideas are borrowed from the <i>Cyropedia</i>. In the
theories regarding the happiness of a people; in the plan of a
state government like a family, we recognize the imagination
and the philosophy of Plato. But we may believe that F&eacute;nelon,
correcting the fables of Homer by the wisdom of Socrates,
and forming that happy mixture of the most pleasing fictions,
of the purest philosophy, and of the most humane politics, is
able to balance, by the charm of this union, the glory of invention
which he cedes to each of his models. Without
doubt F&eacute;nelon has participated in the faults of those that he
imitated; and if the combats of "Telemachus" have the grandeur
and the fire of the combats of the <i>Iliad</i>, Mentor sometimes
speaks as long as one of Homer's heroes; and sometimes the
details of a somewhat commonplace moral discussion remind
us of the long interviews of the <i>Cyropedia</i>. Considering "Telemachus"
as an inspiration of the Greek muses, it seems that
the genius of F&eacute;nelon receives from them a force that to him
was unnatural. The vehemence of Sophocles is completely

<!-- page 134 -->

preserved in the savage imprecations of Philoctetes. Love
burns in the heart of Eucharis as in the verses of Theocritus.
Although the beauties of antiquity seem to have been gleaned
for the composition of Telemachus, there remains to the author
some glory of invention, without taking account of what is
creative in the imitation of foreign beauties, inimitable before
and after F&eacute;nelon. Nothing is more beautiful than the arrangement
of "Telemachus," and we do not find less grandeur
in the general idea, than taste and skill in the union and contrast
of episodes. The chaste and modest loves of Antiope,
introduced at the end of the poem, correct, in a sublime manner,
the transports of Calypso. The interest of passion is thus
twice produced,&mdash;once under the image of madness, and again
under that of virtue. But, as "Telemachus" is especially a book
of political ethics, what the author paints with most force, is
ambition, that malady of kings which brings death to peoples,&mdash;ambition,
great and generous in Sesostris, imprudent in Idomeneus,
tyrannical and calamitous in Pygmalion, barbarous,
hypocritical, and impious in Adrastus. This last character,
superior to Virgil's Mezentius, is traced with a vigor of imagination
that no historical truth could surpass. This invention
of personages is not less rare than the general invention of a
plan. The happiest character among these truthful portraits,
is that of young Telemachus. More developed, more active
than the Telemachus of the Odyssey, he combines all that can
surprise, attach, and instruct;&mdash;in the age of passions, he is
under the guard of wisdom, which often allows him to fail,
because faults are the education of men; he has the pride of
the throne, the transport of heroism, and the candor of early
youth. This mixture of <i>hauteur</i> and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, of force and submission,
forms perhaps the most touching and most amiable
character invented by the epic muse; and, doubtless, Rousseau,
a great master in the art of painting and touching, felt
this marvellous charm, when he supposed that Telemachus
would be, in the eyes of chastity and innocence, the ideal
model worthy of a first love.</p>

<p>Great critics have often repeated that the hero of a poem or

<!-- page 135 -->

a tragedy should not be perfect. They have admired in the
Achilles of Homer, in the Rinaldo of Tasso, the interest of
faults and passions; but they have not foreseen the interest,
not less new, and more instructive, of a character which, at
first, is a mixture of all human weaknesses, but gradually
disengages itself from them, and is developed while being
purified. The character of Telemachus offers the charm
of virtue and the vicissitudes of weakness; it has none the
less movement because it tends to perfection. It is animated
and perfected at the same time; and the interest that we
feel is agitated like the strife of passions, and agreeable like
the triumph of virtue. Doubtless F&eacute;nelon, in this form given
to the principal character, sought before all the instruction
of his pupil; but he created at the same time one of the
most interesting and most novel conceptions of the epopee.
In order to completely seize in Telemachus&mdash;that treasure of
antique riches&mdash;the part of invention belonging to the modem
author, it would be necessary to compare the Hades and Elysium
of F&eacute;nelon with the same pictures traced by Homer and
Virgil. Whatever may be the sublimity of Ajax's silence;
whatever may be the grandeur, the perfection of the sixth
book of the &AElig;neid, one would feel all that F&eacute;nelon has created
anew, or rather all that he has drawn from the Christian mysteries,
by an admirable art, or by an unconscious remembrance.
The greatest of these beauties unknown to antiquity, is the
invention of pains and joys purely spiritual, substituted for the
feeble or grotesque picture of physical ills and felicities. Herein
F&eacute;nelon is sublime, and seizes better than Dante the aid, so
new and so great, of Christianity. Nothing is more philosophic
and more terrible than the moral tortures which he
puts in the heart of the culpable; and, in order to represent
these inexpressible griefs, his style acquires a degree of energy
not expected from him, and found in no other. But when,
delivered from these frightful pictures, he can allow his placid
and beneficent imagination to repose upon the dwelling-place
of the just, then are heard tones which the human voice has
never equalled, and something celestial escapes from his soul

<!-- page 136 -->

intoxicated with the joy that he describes. These ideas are
absolutely foreign to the antique genius; it is the ecstasy of
Christian charity; it is a religion wholly of love, interpreted
by the sweet and tender soul of F&eacute;nelon; it is the pure love
given as a reward to the just, in the Elysium of mythology.
So, when in our days a celebrated writer sought to retrace the
Christian paradise, he must have felt more than once that he
had been preceded by F&eacute;nelon; and in spite of the efforts of
a rich imagination, and the easier and freer employment of
Christian ideas, he was obliged to throw himself back upon
less happy images, and merited only the second rank. The
Elysium of F&eacute;nelon is one of the creations of modern genius;
nowhere does the French language appear more flexible and
more melodious. The style of "Telemachus" has been subjected
to much criticism; Voltaire has given an example of it with
taste. It is certain that the diction so natural, so sweetly animated,
sometimes so energetic and bold, is intermingled with
feeble and languishing details; but they disappear in the
happy facility of the style. The interest of the poem carries
the reader along; and great beauties reanimate and transport
him. As to those who are offended at some words repeated,
at some negligent constructions, let them understand that
beauty of language does not consist in a severe and careful correctness,
but in a choice of simple, happy, expressive words,&mdash;in
a free and varied harmony that accompanies style, and sustains
it as the accent sustains the voice,&mdash;in a sweet glow
everywhere diffused, as the soul and life of discourse.</p>

<p>The <i>Adventures of Aristinous</i><sup id="cr02_ref013"><a href="#cr02_en013">13</a></sup> breathe that melting charm
which is given to but few men&mdash;to Virgil, to Racine, to F&eacute;nelon.
In this <i>morceau</i> of a few pages, one would divine the author
of "Telemachus," as in the <i>Dialogue of Eucrates and Sylla</i>
we recognize Montesquieu. Only to really superior men belongs
the power of thus embracing, in a very narrow compass
the essay of all their genius. After "Telemachus," the most important
work of F&eacute;nelon, in subject and extent, is the <i>Treatise

<!-- page 137 -->

on the Existence of God</i>.<sup id="cr02_ref014"><a href="#cr02_en014">14</a></sup> We do not find in it the profundity
and the logic of Clarke. F&eacute;nelon employs the argument of
final causes, which is very favorable to descriptive imagination;
he scatters the treasures of eloquence; he paints nature,
whose richness and colors he equals with the splendor of his
style; often he gives expression to that abundance of tender
and passionate sentiments which is the natural language of his
heart. Some passages are animated with that luminous and
weighty logic of which he gave so many examples in his controversy
with Bossuet. It is perhaps found in the highest
degree, and freest from ornaments, in his <i>Letters on Religion</i>,<sup id="cr02_ref015"><a href="#cr02_en015">15</a></sup>
a model of sincere and convincing discussion. In fine, as style,
according to the expression of one of the ancients, is the physiognomy
of the soul, all the works of F&eacute;nelon bear the stamp
of a rare and pathetic genius.</p>

<p>His style has always a recognizable character of simplicity,
grace, and sweetness, whether in the passionate flights, in the
eloquently mystic language of his <i>Entretiens affectifs;</i> whether
in the gravity of his <i>Directions for the Conscience of a King;</i><sup id="cr02_ref016"><a href="#cr02_en016">16</a></sup>
or in the marvellous fecundity, subtlety, and noble elegance of
his polemical theology. His style is never that of a man
whose object is to write; it is that of a man possessed of the
truth, who expresses it as he feels it at the bottom of his soul.
And although in our age we most admire careful composition,
in which the labor is more perceptible, and the phrases,
formed with more effort, appear to contain more thought;
although the energetic diction of Rousseau appears to many
judges the most perfect model, we may believe that the style
of F&eacute;nelon, more in accordance with the character of our
language, supposes a rarer and happier genius.</p>

<h2>CRITICAL OPINIONS</h2>

<p class="small">UPON</p>

<p>F&Eacute;NELON AND HIS WORKS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH, speaking of the controversy between
F&eacute;nelon and Bossuet, in his Dissertation on the Progress
of Ethical Philosophy, says: "Never were two great men
more unlike. F&eacute;nelon in his writings exhibits more of the
qualities which predispose to religious feelings, than any other
equally conspicuous person;&mdash;a mind so pure as steadily to
contemplate supreme excellence; a heart capable of being
touched and affected by the contemplation; a gentle and modest
spirit, not elated by the privilege, but seeing its own want
of worth as it came nearer to such brightness, and disposed
to treat with compassionate forbearance those errors in others,
of which it felt a humbling consciousness. Bossuet was rather
a greater minister in the ecclesiastical commonwealth; employing
knowledge, eloquence, argument, the energy of his
character, the influence and even the authority of his station,
to vanquish opponents, to extirpate revolters, and, sometimes
with a patrician firmness, to withstand the dictatorial encroachment
of the Roman pontiff on the spiritual aristocracy of
France."</p>

<p>Hallam thus speaks of "Telemachus:" "The Tel&eacute;maque of
F&eacute;nelon, after being suppressed in France, appeared in Holland
clandestinely, without the author's consent, in 1699. It is
needless to say that it soon obtained the admiration of Europe;

<!-- page 140 -->

and, perhaps, there is no book in the French language that
has been more read. F&eacute;nelon seems to have conceived that,
metre not being essential, as he assumed, to poetry, he had,
by imitating the Odyssey in Tel&eacute;maque, produced an epic of
as legitimate a character as his model. But the boundaries
between epic poetry, especially such epics as the Odyssey, and
romance were only perceptible by the employment of verse in
the former; no elevation of character, no ideality of conception,
no charm of imagery or emotion, had been denied to
romance. The language of poetry had for two centuries been
seized for its use. Tel&eacute;maque must therefore take its place
among romances; but still it is true that no romance had
breathed so classical a spirit, none had abounded so much with
the richness of poetical language,&mdash;much, in fact, of Homer,
Virgil, and Sophocles having been woven in with no other
change than verbal translation,&mdash;nor had any preserved such
dignity in its circumstances, such beauty, harmony, and nobleness
in its diction. It would be as idle to say that F&eacute;nelon
was indebted to D'Urf&eacute; and Calprenede, as to deny that some
degree of resemblance may be found in their poetical prose.
The one belonged to the morals of chivalry, generous but exaggerated;
the other to those of wisdom and religion. The
one had been forgotten, because its tone is false; the other is
ever admired, and is only less regarded, because it is true in
excess,&mdash;because it contains too much of what we know. Tel&eacute;maque,
like some other of F&eacute;nelon's writings, is to be considered
in reference to its object; an object of all the noblest,
being to form the character of one to whom many must look
up for their welfare, but still very different from the inculcation
of profound truth. The beauties of Tel&eacute;maque are very
numerous; the descriptions, and, indeed, the whole tone of
the book, have a charm of grace something like the pictures
of Guido; but there is also a certain languor which steals over
us in reading; and, though there is no real want of variety in
the narration, it reminds us so continually of its source, the
Homeric legends, as to become rather monotonous. The
abandonment of verse has produced too much diffuseness; it

<!-- page 141 -->

will be observed, if we look attentively, that where Homer is
circumstantial, F&eacute;nelon is more so; in this he sometimes approaches
the minuteness of the romancers. But these defects
are more than compensated by the moral and even &aelig;sthetic
excellence of this romance."</p>

<p>Dr. Hugh Blair, in one of his Lectures on the Epic Poets,
thus speaks of the same work: "In reviewing the epic poets,
it were unjust to make no mention of the amiable author
of the Adventures of Telemachus. This work, though not
composed in verse, is justly entitled to be held a poem. The
measured poetical prose in which it is written is remarkably
harmonious, and gives the style nearly as much elevation as
the French language is capable of supporting, even in regular
verse.</p>

<p>"The plan of the work is, in general, well contrived, and
is deficient neither in epic grandeur nor unity of object. The
author has entered with much felicity into the spirit and ideas
of the ancient poets, particularly into the ancient mythology,
which retains more dignity and makes a better figure in his
hands, than in those of any modern poet. His descriptions
are rich and beautiful, especially of the softer and calmer
scenes, for which the genius of F&eacute;nelon was best suited; such
as the incidents of pastoral life, the pleasures of virtue, or a
country flourishing in peace. There is an inimitable sweetness
and tenderness in several of the pictures of this kind which
he has given.</p>

<p>"The best executed part of the work is the first six books,
in which Telemachus recounts his adventures to Calypso. The
narrative throughout them is lively and interesting; afterwards,
especially in the last twelve books, it becomes more tedious and
languid; and in the warlike adventures which are attempted,
there is a great defect of vigor. The chief objection against
this work being classed with epic poems, arises from the minute
details of virtuous policy into which the author in some places
enters; and from the discourses and instructions of Mentor,
which recur upon us too often, and too much in the strain of
commonplace morality. Though these were well suited to

<!-- page 142 -->

the main design of the author, which was to form the mind of
a young prince, yet they seem not congruous to the nature of
epic poetry, the object of which is to improve us by means of
actions, characters, and sentiments, rather than by delivering
professed and formal instructions.</p>

<p>"Several of the epic poets have described a descent into
hell; and in the prospects they have given us of the invisible
world, we may observe the gradual refinement of men's notions
concerning a state of future rewards and punishments. The
descent of Ulysses into hell, in Homer's Odyssey, presents to
us a very indistinct and dreary sort of object. The scene is
laid in the country of the Cimmerians, which is always covered
with clouds and darkness, at the extremity of the ocean.
When the spirits of the dead begin to appear, we scarcely
know whether Ulysses is above ground or below it. None of
the ghosts, even of the heroes, appear satisfied with their condition
in the other world; and when Ulysses endeavors to
comfort Achilles by reminding him of the illustrious figure
which he must make in those regions, Achilles roundly tells
him that all such speeches are idle; for he would rather be a
day-laborer on earth, than have command of all the dead.</p>

<p>"In the sixth book of the &AElig;neid, we discern a much
greater refinement of ideas, corresponding to the progress
which the world had then made in philosophy. The objects
there delineated are more clear and distinct, and more grand
and awful. The separate mansions of good and bad spirits,
with the punishments of the one and the employments and
happiness of the other, are finely described, and in consistency
with the most pure morality. But the visit which F&eacute;nelon
makes Telemachus pay to the Shades is much more philosophical
than Virgil's. He employs the same fables and the same
mythology; but we find the ancient mythology refined by
the knowledge of the true religion, and adorned with that
beautiful enthusiasm for which F&eacute;nelon was so distinguished.
His account of the happiness of the just is an excellent description
in the mystic strain, and very expressive of the genius
and spirit of the author."</p>

<!-- page 143 -->

<p>Dr. Channing, in reviewing a book entitled "Selections from
the Writings of F&eacute;nelon," says:</p>

<p>"We welcome a book from F&eacute;nelon; and we do so, because,
if not a profound he was an original thinker, and because,
though a Catholic, he was essentially free. He wrote from his
own mind, and seldom has a purer mind tabernacled in flesh.
He professed to believe in an infallible Church; but he listened
habitually to the voice of God within him, and speaks of this
in language so strong as to have given the Quakers some plea
for ranking him among themselves. So little did he confine
himself to established notions that he drew upon himself the
censures of his Church, and, like some other Christians whom
we could name, has been charged with a refined Deism. His
works have the great charm of coming fresh from the soul.
He wrote from experience, and hence, though he often speaks
in language which must seem almost a foreign one to men of
the world, yet he always speaks in a tone of reality. That he
has excesses we mean not to deny, but they are of a kind
which we regard with more than indulgence, almost with admiration.
. . . . .</p>

<p>"F&eacute;nelon saw far into the human heart, and especially into
the lurkings of self-love. He looked with a piercing eye
through the disguises of sin; but he knew sin, not as most
men do, by bitter experience of its power, so much as by his
knowledge and experience of virtue. Deformity was revealed
to him by his refined perceptions and intense love of moral
beauty. The light which he carried with him into the dark
corners of the human heart, and by which he laid open its
most hidden guilt, was that of celestial goodness. Hence,
though the severest of censors, he is the most pitying. Not a
tone of asperity escapes him. He looks on human error with
in angel's tenderness, with tears which an angel might shed,
and thus reconciles and binds us to our race, at the very moment
of revealing its corruptions.</p>

<p>"That F&eacute;nelon's views of human nature were dark, too
dark, we learn from almost every page of his writings, and at
this we cannot wonder.  He was early thrown into the very

<!-- page 144 -->

Court from which Rochefoucauld drew his celebrated Maxims&mdash;perhaps
the very spot, above all others on the face of the earth,
distinguished and disgraced by selfishness, hypocrisy, and
intrigue. When we think of F&eacute;nelon in the palace of Louis
the Fourteenth, it reminds us of a seraph sent on a divine
commission into the abodes of the lost; and when we recollect
that in that atmosphere he composed his Telemachus, we
doubt whether the records of the world furnish stronger evidence
of the power of a divine virtue to turn temptation into
glory and strength, and to make even crowned and prosperous
vice a means of triumph and exaltation. . . . . ."</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Review, vol. 107, in an article upon a work
entitled <i>M&eacute;moires et Journal sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de
Bossuet</i>, says: "Bossuet was born with all the vigor and fixity
of age; F&eacute;nelon retained until death all the generous glow and
boundless elasticity of youth. Bossuet preached the doctrine
of fear,&mdash;F&eacute;nelon that of love. Bossuet's mind was petrified
by ever looking back,&mdash;that of F&eacute;nelon was directed ever forward,
in spite of the taunts and despair of skeptics and unbelievers.
The one loved immutability, the other progress. In
the heart of the one ruled mistrust, in that of the other confidence.
Bossuet was a Conservative, F&eacute;nelon a Liberal. The
genius of the former was Hebrew and Roman, that of the latter
Grecian and Evangelical. The one had the stern majesty of
a prophet by Michael Angelo, the other the ecstatic beauty of
a martyr by Guido Reni."</p>

by Lebel, as publisher, and finished in Paris in 1830 by Leclerc.
In the edition of Besan&ccedil;on (27 vols. in 8vo, 1830), more than
half of the correspondence is omitted. In 1782 the Assembly
of the Clergy of France appropriated forty thousand livres to
defray the expenses of publishing the works of F&eacute;nelon. The
preparation of the edition was intrusted first to the Abb&eacute;
Gallard, and afterwards to the Abb&eacute; de Querbeuf; but, from

whatever cause, in this collection of F&eacute;nelon's writings (9 vols
in 4to, Paris, 1787-1792), the reader will seek in vain for
those on Quietism and Jansenism, his <i>Explication des Maximes</i>,
and his <i>Mandements</i>. The edition of Toulouse (19 vols. 12mo,
1809-1811) contains Querbeuf's Life of F&eacute;nelon, and four <i>Instructions
Pastorales</i>, and an <i>Abridgement of the Lives of the
Ancient Philosophers</i>, omitted in the previous edition. A
good selection from F&eacute;nelon's works was published by Perisse
Fr&egrave;res, Paris, 1842, 4 vols. 8vo. Didot Fr&egrave;res have published
the works of F&eacute;nelon in three large 8vo. volumes, which is a
cheap (30 franc) and very good edition. The edition of Versailles
mentioned above is the best.</p>

<p>Of the innumerable editions of "Telemachus," that of Lef&egrave;vre
(1 vol. 8vo, Paris, 1853) is perhaps the best.</p>

<p>The most complete biographical account of F&eacute;nelon is that
given by M. de Bausset in his <i>Histoire de F&eacute;nelon</i> (3 vols. 8vo,
1808). The Abb&eacute; Gosselin, director of the Seminary of St.
Sulpice, published an interesting book in 1843, entitled, <i>Literary
History of F&eacute;nelon, or Historical and Literary Review
of his Writings</i> (Paris, 1 vol. 8vo).</p>

<p>We intend in our collection of the French classics, to give
either carefully revised or new translations of all the works of
F&eacute;nelon that have an enduring interest.</p>

<p class="small">Telemachus, conducted by Minerva under the likeness of Mentor, lands,
after having suffered shipwreck, upon the island of the goddess Calypso,
who is still regretting the departure of Ulysses. The goddess receives
him favorably, conceives a passion for him, offers him immortality, and
inquires after his adventures. He recounts his voyage to Pylos and
Laced&aelig;mon; his shipwreck on the coast of Sicily; the danger he was
in of being offered as a sacrifice to the manes of Anchises; the assistance
which Mentor and he gave Acestes against an incursion of barbarians,
and the gratitude of the king, who, to reward their service, gave them
a Tyrian vessel, that they might return to their country.</p>

<p>CALYPSO was unable to console herself for the departure of
Ulysses.<sup id="t_ref001"><a href="#t_en001">1</a></sup> She regretted her immortality,<sup id="t_ref002"><a href="#t_en002">2</a></sup> as that which could
only perpetuate affliction, and aggravate calamity by despair.
Her grotto no more echoed with the music of her voice; and
her nymphs waited at a distance, with timidity and silence.
She often wandered alone along the borders of her island,
amid the luxuriance of a perpetual spring; but the beauties
that bloomed around her, instead of soothing her grief, only
impressed more strongly upon her mind the memory of Ulysses,
who had been so often the companion of her walks. Sometimes
she stood motionless upon the beach; and while her
eyes were fixed on that part of the horizon, where the lessening

<!-- page 150 -->

bark of the hero at length disappeared, they overflowed
with tears.</p>

<p>Here she was one day surprised with the sudden appearance
of a shipwreck: broken benches and oars lay scattered about
upon the sand; a rudder, a mast, and some cordage were
floating near the shore. Soon after, she perceived at a distance
two men, one of whom appeared to be aged, and in the other,
although a youth, she discovered a strong resemblance of
Ulysses. The same benevolence and dignity were united in
his aspect; his stature was equally lofty, and his port equally
majestic. The goddess knew immediately that this was Telemachus;
but, notwithstanding the penetration of divine sagacity,
she could not discover who was his companion; for it
is the prerogative of superior deities to conceal whatever they
please from those of a lower class; and it was the pleasure of
Minerva, who accompanied Telemachus in the likeness of
Mentor, to be concealed from Calypso.</p>

<p>Calypso, however, rejoiced in the happy shipwreck, which
had restored Ulysses to her wishes in the person of his son.
She advanced to meet him; and, affecting not to know him,
she said: "How hast thou presumed to land on this island?
Knowest thou not, that from my dominions no daring intruder
departs unpunished?" By this menace she hoped to conceal
the joy which glowed in her bosom, and which she could not
prevent from sparkling in her countenance.</p>

<p>"Whoever thou art,"<sup id="t_ref003"><a href="#t_en003">3</a></sup> replied Telemachus; "whether thou
art indeed a goddess, or whether, with all the appearance of
divinity, thou art yet mortal; canst thou regard with insensibility
the misfortunes of a son, who, committing his life to the
caprice of the winds and waves in search of a father, has suffered
shipwreck against these rocks?"  "Who then is thy

<!-- page 151 -->

father whom thou seekest?" inquired the goddess. "He is
one of the confederate kings," answered Telemachus, "who,
after a siege of ten years, laid Troy in ashes, and his name is
Ulysses; a name which he has rendered famous by his prowess,
and yet more by his wisdom, not only through all Greece,
but to the remotest boundaries of Asia. He is now a wanderer
on the deep, the sport of tempests which no force can
resist, and the prey of dangers which no sagacity can elude.
His country seems to fly before him.<sup id="t_ref004"><a href="#t_en004">4</a></sup> Penelope, his wife, despairs
at Ithaca of his return. I, though equally destitute of
hope, pursue him through all the perils that he has passed, and
seek him upon every coast. I seek him; but, alas! perhaps
the sea has already closed over him forever! O goddess,
compassionate our distress; and, if thou knowest what the
fates have wrought, either to save or destroy Ulysses, vouchsafe
this knowledge to Telemachus his son!"</p>

<p>Such force of eloquence, such maturity of wisdom, and such
blooming youth, filled the bosom of Calypso with astonishment
and tenderness: she gazed upon him with a fixed attention;
but her eyes were still unsatisfied, and she remained some time
silent. At length she said: "We will acquaint you, Telemachus,
with the adventures of your father. But the story will
be long: it is now time that you should repair that strength
by rest, which has been exhausted by labor. Come into my
dwelling, where I will receive you as my son; come,&mdash;you
shall be my comfort in this solitude; and, if you are not voluntarily
wretched, I will be your felicity."</p>

<p>Telemachus followed the goddess, who was encircled by a
crowd of young nymphs, among whom she was distinguished
by the superiority of her stature,<sup id="t_ref005"><a href="#t_en005">5</a></sup> as the towering summit of a

<!-- page 152 -->

lofty oak is seen, in the midst of a forest, above all the trees
that surround it. He was struck with the splendor of her
beauty, the rich purple of her long and flowing robe, her hair
that was tied with graceful<sup id="t_ref006"><a href="#t_en006">6</a></sup> negligence behind her, and the
vivacity and softness that were mingled in her eyes. Mentor
followed Telemachus, modestly silent, and looking downwards.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the entrance of the grotto, Telemachus
was surprised to discover, under the appearance of rural
simplicity, whatever could captivate the sight. There was,
indeed, neither gold, nor silver, nor marble; no decorated
columns,<sup id="t_ref007"><a href="#t_en007">7</a></sup> no paintings, no statues were to be seen; but the
grotto consisted of several vaults cut in the rock; the roof
was embellished with shells and pebbles; and the want of
tapestry was supplied by the luxuriance of a young vine, which
extended its branches equally on every side.<sup id="t_ref008"><a href="#t_en008">8</a></sup>  Here the heat

<!-- page 153 -->

of the sun was tempered by the freshness of the breeze; the
rivulets that with soothing murmurs wandered through meadows
of intermingled violets and amaranth,<sup id="t_ref009"><a href="#t_en009">9</a></sup> formed innumerable
baths that were pure and transparent as crystal; the verdant
carpet which nature had spread around the grotto was adorned
with a thousand flowers. At a small distance, there was a
wood of those trees that in every season unfold new blossoms,
which diffuse ambrosial fragrance, and ripen into golden fruit.<sup id="t_ref010"><a href="#t_en010">10</a></sup>
In this wood, which was impervious to the rays of the sun,<sup id="t_ref011"><a href="#t_en011">11</a></sup>
and heightened the beauty of the adjacent meadows by an
agreeable contrast of light and shade, nothing was to be
heard but the song of birds, or the sound of water, which falling
from the summit of a rock, was dashed into foam below, where,
forming a small rivulet, it glided hastily over the meadow.<sup id="t_ref012"><a href="#t_en012">12</a></sup></p>

<p>The grotto of Calypso was situated on the declivity of a
hill. It commanded a prospect of the sea, sometimes smooth,
peaceful, and limpid; sometimes swelling into mountains, and
breaking with idle rage against the shore.<sup id="t_ref013"><a href="#t_en013">13</a></sup> At another view a
river was discovered, in which were many islands, surrounded
with limes that were covered with flowers, and poplars that
raised their heads to the clouds. The streams which formed
those islands seemed to stray through the fields with a kind of
sportful wantonness: some rolled along in translucent waves
with a tumultuous rapidity; some glided away in silence with

<!-- page 154 -->

a motion that was scarcely perceptible; others, after a long circuit,
turned back, as if they wished to issue again from their
source, and were unwilling to quit the paradise<sup id="t_ref014"><a href="#t_en014">14</a></sup> through which
they flowed. The distant hills and mountains hid their summits
in the blue vapors that hovered over them, and diversified
the horizon with strange forms that were equally pleasing and
romantic. The mountains that were less remote, were covered
with vines, the branches of which were interwoven with each
other, and hung down in festoons. Grapes, which surpassed in
lustre the richest purple, were too exuberant to be concealed
by the foliage, and the branches bowed under the weight of
the fruit. The fig, the olive, the pomegranate, and other trees
without number, overspread the plain; so that the whole
country had the appearance of a garden, of infinite variety
and boundless extent.</p>

<p>Calypso, having displayed this profusion of nature's beauty
to Telemachus, said to him: "Go now, and refresh yourself
and change your apparel, which is wet. I will afterwards see
you again, and relate such things as shall affect your heart."
She then caused him to enter, with his friend, into the most
secret recess of a grotto adjoining her own. Here the nymphs
had already kindled a fire with some billets of cedar, which
perfumed the place, and had left change of apparel for the new
guests.</p>

<p>Telemachus, perceiving that a tunic of the finest wool,
whiter than snow, and a purple robe embroidered with gold,
were intended for him, contemplated the magnificence of his
dress with a pleasure natural to a youth.</p>

<p>Mentor perceived his weakness, and reproved it. "Are these
then," said he, "O Telemachus, such thoughts as become the
son of Ulysses? Be rather studious to appropriate the character

<!-- page 155 -->

of thy father, and to surmount the persecutions of fortune.
The youth who, like a woman, loves to adorn his person, has
renounced all claim to wisdom and to glory: glory is due to
him only who can bear pain, and trample pleasure under his
feet."</p>

<p>Telemachus answered with a sigh: "May the gods destroy
me, rather than suffer me to be enslaved by voluptuous effeminacy!
No; the son of Ulysses shall never be seduced by
the charms of enervating and inglorious ease! But how
gracious is heaven, to have directed us, destitute and shipwrecked,
to this goddess, or this mortal, who has loaded us
with benefits!"</p>

<p>"Fear rather," replied Mentor, "lest her wiles should overwhelm
thee with ruin; fear her deceitful blandishments more
than the rocks on which thou hast suffered shipwreck; for
shipwreck and death are less dreadful than those pleasures by
which virtue is subverted. Believe not the tales which she
shall relate. The presumption of youth hopes all things from
itself, and, however impotent, believes it has power over every
event; it dreams of security in the midst of danger, and listens
to subtlety without suspicion. Beware of Calypso's seducing
eloquence, which, like a serpent, glides beneath flowers;&mdash;dread
the concealed poison! Trust not thyself, but confide
implicitly in my counsel."</p>

<p>They then returned to Calypso, who was waiting for them.
Her nymphs, who were dressed in white, and had their hair
braided, set before them a repast, which, though it was simple,
and consisted only of such game as they had either taken with
their nets, or killed in the chase, was yet of exquisite taste,
and served up with elegance. Wine, more richly flavored
than nectar, was poured from large silver vases, and sparkled
in cups of gold that were wreathed with flowers; and baskets
were heaped with all the variety of fruit that is promised by
spring and bestowed by autumn. In the mean time four of
the attendant nymphs began to sing. Their first theme was
the battle of the Gods and Titans; then they celebrated the
loves of Jupiter and Semele; the birth of Bacchus, and his

<!-- page 156 -->

education under old Silenus; the race of Atalanta<sup id="t_ref015"><a href="#t_en015">15</a></sup> with Hippomenes,
by whom she was conquered with golden apples from
the gardens of the Hesperides:<sup id="t_ref016"><a href="#t_en016">16</a></sup> the wars of Troy were reserved
to the last; the prowess and the wisdom of Ulysses
were extolled to the heavens. The principal nymph, whose
name was Leucothoe, to the harmonious voices of the chorus
joined the music of her lyre.</p>

<p>When Telemachus heard the name of his father, the tears
which stole down his cheeks added new lustre to his beauty.<sup id="t_ref017"><a href="#t_en017">17</a></sup>
But Calypso, perceiving that he was too sensibly touched, and
neglected to eat, made a signal to her nymphs. They immediately
changed the subject to the battle of the Centaurs with
the Lapith&aelig;, and the descent of Orpheus to bring back his
Eurydice from hell.</p>

<p>When the repast was ended. Calypso took Telemachus aside,
and addressed him thus: "Thou seest, O son of the great
Ulysses, with what favor I have received thee. Know, that I
am immortal: no human foot profanes this island unpunished;
nor could even shipwreck avert my indignation from thee, if
my heart were not touched with more than thy misfortunes.
Thy father was equally distinguished by my favor; but, alas!
he knew not how to improve the advantage. I detained him
long in this island; and here he might have lived forever in a
state of immortality<sup id="t_ref018"><a href="#t_en018">18</a></sup> with me; but a fond desire of returning

<!-- page 157 -->

to his wretched country blinded him to the prospect of superior
felicity. Thou seest what he has lost for Ithaca, to which
he can never return. He resolved to leave me, and departed;
but a tempest revenged the insult, and the vessel in which he
had embarked, having been long the sport of the storm, was
at last swallowed up in the deep. Let this example influence
thy conduct. All hopes of again seeing thy father, and of succeeding
to his throne, are now at an end. Do not too deeply
regret his loss, since thou hast found a goddess who offers thee
superior dominion, and more permanent felicity."</p>

<p>Calypso, after this declaration, exerted all her eloquence to
display the happiness she had conferred upon Ulysses;&mdash;she
recounted his adventures<sup id="t_ref019"><a href="#t_en019">19</a></sup> in the Cave of Polyphemus, the
Cyclop, and in the country of Antiphates, king of the L&aelig;strygones;&mdash;she
forgot neither what happened to him in the island
of Circe, the daughter of the Sun, nor the dangers of his passage
between Scylla and Charybdis. She described the tempest
that had been raised against him by Neptune, after his
departure from her, in which she insinuated that he had perished,
concealing his arrival in the island of the Pheacians.</p>

<p>Telemachus, who had too hastily congratulated himself upon
the bounty of Calypso, now perceived the evil of her designs,
and the wisdom of that counsel which had been just given him
by Mentor. He answered in few words: "Forgive, O goddess,
my sorrow; my heart is now susceptible only of regret;
but I may hereafter be again capable of felicity. Suffer me
now to pay at least a few tears to the memory of my father:
thou knowest, better than his son, how well he deserves the
tribute."</p>

<p>Calypso, perceiving that it was not now her interest to press
him further, feigned to participate in his sorrow, and to regret
the fate of Ulysses. But, that she might gain a more perfect
knowledge of the means by which his affections were to be

<!-- page 158 -->

engaged, she inquired the particulars of his shipwreck, and by
what accident he had been thrown upon her coast. "The story
of my misfortunes," said he, "will be too long." "No, no,"
responded Calypso, "I am impatient to hear it; indulge me,
therefore, without delay." Telemachus long refused; but she
continued her solicitations, and at length he complied.</p>

<p>"I set out from Ithaca<sup id="t_ref020"><a href="#t_en020">20</a></sup> to inquire after my father of those
princes who had returned from the siege of Troy. The suitors
of Penelope, my mother, were surprised at my departure; because
from them, whom I knew to be perfidious, I had concealed
my purpose. Neither Nestor, whom I saw at Pylos,
nor Menelaus, who received me with affection at Lacedemon,
knew whether my father was among the living or dead. Impatient
of perpetual suspense and uncertainty, I resolved to go
into Sicily, whither my father was said to have been driven
by contrary winds. But the prudent Mentor, who is here the
companion of my fortunes, opposed the execution of so rash a
design; he represented my danger, upon the one hand, from the
Cyclops, the gigantic monsters who riot on human flesh, and,
on the other, from the fleet of &AElig;neas and the Trojans, who
were hovering about those coasts. 'The Trojans,' said he,
'are irritated against all the Greeks; but, above all, against
Ulysses, whose son, therefore, they would rejoice to destroy.
Return then to Ithaca. Perhaps your father, who is beloved
by the gods, may have returned already. But if heaven has
decreed his death, if he shall see Ithaca no more, it is fit that
you return to avenge him and to deliver your mother; to display
your wisdom to attending nations; and to let all Greece
behold, in Telemachus, a sovereign not less worthy of the
throne than Ulysses.'</p>

<p>"This counsel, which was the voice of reason, I rejected, and
listened only to the suggestions of my passions; but such was

<!-- page 159 -->

the affection of Mentor for me, that he embarked with me for
that voyage, which, in the folly of my presumption, I undertook
contrary to his advice; and the gods, perhaps, permitted
the fault, that the calamity which it drew upon me might teach
me wisdom."</p>

<p>While Telemachus had been speaking, Calypso had attentively
considered Mentor, and was suddenly chilled with astonishment.
She imagined that she perceived in him something more
than human. Not being able to resolve the perplexity of her
thoughts into any probable determination, the presence of this
inscrutable being continued to agitate her mind with suspicion
and dread. Fearing yet more that her confusion should be
perceived, she said to Telemachus: "Proceed, and gratify my
curiosity."  Telemachus resumed his story thus:</p>

<p>"We steered some time with a favorable wind for Sicily,
but at length a tempest overcast the sky, and involved us in
sudden darkness.<sup id="t_ref021"><a href="#t_en021">21</a></sup> By the transient gleams of the lightning
we perceived other vessels that were exposed to the same
danger; and were soon convinced that they were part of the
Trojan fleet, and were not less to be dreaded by us than
shoals and rocks. Then, but too late, I perfectly comprehended
what the ardor of youth had before prevented me from considering
with sufficient attention. In this dreadful exigence,
Mentor appeared not only fearless and calm, but more than
usually cheerful; he encouraged me to hope, and as he spoke,
I perceived myself inspired with invincible fortitude. While
he was directing the navigation of the vessel with the utmost
tranquillity, the pilot being incapacitated by terror and confusion,
I said to him: 'My dear Mentor, why did I reject your
advice? What greater evil can befall me than a confidence in
my own opinion, at an age which can form no judgment of the
future, has gained no experience from the past, and knows not

<!-- page 160 -->

how to employ the present? If we survive this tempest, 1
will distrust myself as my most dangerous enemy, and confide
only in Mentor.'</p>

<p>"Mentor replied with a smile: 'I have no desire to reproach
you with the fault you have committed; if you have such a
sense of it as will enable you to repress the violence of desire
hereafter, I am satisfied. But when danger is past, perhaps
presumption will return. By courage only can we now escape.
Before we incur danger, we should consider it as formidable;
but when it is present, we should treat it with contempt.
Show thyself worthy of Ulysses, then, and discover a mind
superior to all the evils which combine against thee.'</p>

<p>"The candor and magnanimity of Mentor gave me great
pleasure; but I was transported with wonder and delight at
the stratagem by which he delivered us. Just as the clouds
broke, and the light must in a few minutes have discovered us
to the Trojans, who were very near, he remarked that one of
their vessels, which greatly resembled ours, except that the
stern was decorated with garlands of flowers, had been separated
from the rest of the fleet in the storm; he immediately
placed ornaments of the same kind at the stern of our vessel,
and made them fast himself with bandages of the same color
as those of the Trojans; he also ordered the rowers to stoop
over their seats as low as possible, that our enemies might not
discover them to be Greeks. In this manner he proceeded
through the midst of their fleet; and the Trojans, mistaking
us for their companions which had been missing, shouted as we
passed. We were some time forced irresistibly along with
them, but at length found means to linger behind; and while
they were driven by the impetuosity of the wind towards
Africa,<sup id="t_ref022"><a href="#t_en022">22</a></sup> we labored at the oar and made our utmost effort to
land on the neighboring coast of Sicily.</p>

<p>"Our labor indeed succeeded; but the port which we sought
was scarcely less to be dreaded than the fleet which we had

<!-- page 161 -->

endeavored to avoid; for on the coast of Sicily. we found other
fugitives from Troy, who had settled there under the government
of Acestes,<sup id="t_ref023"><a href="#t_en023">23</a></sup> who was himself of Trojan extraction. We
had no sooner landed than these people, imagining either that
we were inhabitants of some other part of the island, who had
taken arms to surprise them, or a foreign enemy, who had
invaded the country, burnt our vessel in the first tumult of
their rage, and put all our companions to the sword. Mentor
and myself were spared only that we might be presented to
Acestes, and that he might learn from us what were our
designs and whence we came. We entered the city, with our
hands bound behind<sup id="t_ref024"><a href="#t_en024">24</a></sup> us; and had nothing to expect from this
respite but that our death would be made the spectacle of a
cruel people as soon as they should discover us to be Greeks.</p>

<p>"We were brought before Acestes, who was sitting with a
sceptre of gold in his hand, administering justice to his people,
and preparing to assist at a solemn sacrifice. He asked us,
with a stem voice, the name of our country and the purpose
of our voyage. Mentor instantly replied: 'We come from
the coast of the greater Hesperia,<sup id="t_ref025"><a href="#t_en025">25</a></sup> and our country is not far
from thence.' He thus avoided a declaration that we were
Greeks. But Acestes would hear no more, and concluding
that we were strangers, who had formed some evil design,
which we were therefore solicitous to conceal, he commanded
that we should be sent into the neighboring forests to serve as
slaves under those who had the care of his herds.</p>

<p>"To live upon this condition seemed to me harder than to
die.  I cried out: 'O king, punish us rather with death than

<!-- page 162 -->

infamy. Know that I am Telemachus, son of the wise Ulysses,
king of Ithaca; in search of my father I am bound to every
shore; but, in this search, if I am not permitted to succeed, if
I must never more return to my country, and if I can no longer
live but as a slave, put an end to my life, and relieve me from
a burden that I cannot support.'</p>

<p>"This exclamation inflamed the multitude; and they immediately
demanded that the son of Ulysses, by whose inhuman
subtlety Troy had been subverted, should be put to death.
Acestes then turning to me, cried out: 'I cannot refuse thy
blood, O son of Ulysses, to the manes of those Trojans with
whom thy father crowded the banks of Cocytus: thou must
die, and thy conductor shall perish with thee.' At the same
instant, an old man proposed to the king that we should be
offered up on the tomb of Anchises. 'The shade of that hero,'
said he, 'will be gratified with their blood; and even the
great &AElig;neas, when he shall be told of such a sacrifice, will be
touched with joy at the zeal of your affection for the supreme
object of his own.'</p>

"This proposition was received with a shout of applause,
and the execution of it was immediately begun. We were
conducted to the tomb of Anchises, where two altars had been
prepared; the hallowed fire was kindled, and the sacrificial
knife lay before us. They had adorned us, as victims, with
garlands of flowers; and the pleadings of compassion were
overborne by the impetuosity of zeal. But, just at this dreadful
crisis, Mentor, with all the calmness of security, demanded
audience of the king, and addressed him thus:</p>

<p>" 'O Acestes, if the misfortunes of Telemachus, who is yet
a youth, and has never borne arms against the Trojans, can
excite no pity in thy breast, at least let thy own danger
awaken thy attention. The skill that I have acquired in
omens, by which the will of the gods is discovered, enables
me to foretell, that within three days a nation of barbarians
will rush upon thee from the mountains, like a flood, to spoil
thy city and overspread thy country with desolation. Make
haste to avert the torrent; arm thy people, and secure within

<!-- page 163 -->

the walls of the city whatever is valuable in the field. If,
when three days have elapsed, my predictions shall appear to
have been false, let these altars be stained with our blood; but,
on the contrary, if it shall be confirmed by the event, let Acestes
remember that he ought not to take away the life of those
to whom he will be indebted for his own.'</p>

<p>"At these words, which were pronounced not with the diffidence
of conjecture, but the assurance of certain knowledge,
Acestes was astonished. 'I perceive, O stranger,' said he,
'that the gods, who have allotted thee so small a portion of the
gifts of fortune, have enriched thee with the more valuable
treasures of wisdom.' He then commanded the solemnities of
the sacrifice to be suspended, and immediately made preparations
against the invasion which had been predicted by Mentor.
Multitudes of women, trembling with fear, and men decrepit
with age, followed by children, whom the alarm had
terrified into tears, were seen on every side, crowding to the
city. Bleating sheep and lowing cattle came in such droves
from the pastures, that they were obliged to stand without
cover in the street. A confused noise was everywhere to be
heard, of multitudes that jostled each other with tumultuous
and undistinguished outcries, that mistook a stranger for a
friend, and pressed forward with the utmost eagerness, though
they knew not whither they were going. The principal citizens,
indeed, imagining themselves to be wiser than the rest,
regarded Mentor as an impostor, who had invented a falsehood
to prolong his life.</p>

<p>"Before the end of the third day, while they were yet applauding
their own sagacity, a cloud of dust was perceived
upon the declivity of the neighboring mountains, and an innumerable
multitude of armed barbarians were soon after distinguished.
These were the Himerians, and other savages,
that inhabit the Nebrodian mountains, and the summit of
Acragas<sup id="t_ref026"><a href="#t_en026">26</a></sup>; regions in which the severity of the winter is never

<!-- page 164 -->

softened by the breezes of spring. Those who had despised
the prediction of Mentor, were now punished by the loss of
their slaves and their cattle; and the king addressed him to
this effect: 'From henceforth I forget that you are Greeks,
since you are no more enemies, but friends; and, as you were,
doubtless, sent by the gods for our deliverance, I hope not less
from your valor than I have experienced from your wisdom;
delay not, therefore, to afford us your assistance.'</p>

<p>"There appears in the eyes of Mentor a daring that awes
the fiercest combatants. He snatches a shield, a helmet, a
sword, a lance: he draws up the soldiers of Acestes, and advances
towards the enemy at their head. Acestes, whose
courage is still high, but whose body is enfeebled by age, can
only follow him at a distance. I approach nearer to his person,
but not to his valor. In the battle, his cuirass resembles
the immortal &aelig;gis of Minerva. Death, watching his sword as
a signal, follows him from rank to rank. Thus a lion of Numidia,
that hunger has made yet more furious, rushes among
the flock;<sup id="t_ref027"><a href="#t_en027">27</a></sup> he kills and tears to pieces without resistance; and
the shepherds, instead of attempting to defend their sheep, fly
with terror and trepidation to preserve themselves.</p>

<p>"The barbarians, who hoped to have surprised the city,
were themselves surprised and disconcerted. The subjects of
Acestes, animated by the example and the voice of Mentor,
exerted a power which they knew not that they possessed.

<!-- page 165 -->

The son of the king, who commanded the invasion, fell by my
hand. Our ages were equal, but he greatly exceeded me in
stature; for those savages are descended from a race of giants,
whose origin was the same as that of the Cyclops. I perceived
that he despised me as a feeble enemy; but regarding
neither the fierceness of his demeanor, nor the superiority of
his strength, I made a thrust at his breast with my lance. The
weapon entered deeply, he vomited a torrent of dark blood,
and expired. I was in danger of being crushed by his weight
as he fell, and the distant mountains echoed with the clash of
his armor. After I had stripped the body of the spoils,<sup id="t_ref028"><a href="#t_en028">28</a></sup> I returned
to seek Acestes. Mentor, having completed the disorder
of the enemy, cut to pieces all that made a show of
resistance, and pursued the fugitives to the woods.</p>

<p>"This success, of which every one had despaired, fixed all
eyes upon Mentor, as a favorite of the gods, and distinguished
by divine inspiration. Acestes, in gratitude to his deliverers,
acquainted us that it would no longer be in his power to protect
us, if the fleet of &AElig;neas should put back to Sicily. He
therefore furnished us with a vessel, that we might return to
our country; and, having loaded us with presents, he urged
our immediate departure, as the only means by which the approaching
danger could be avoided. He would not, however,
supply us either with rowers or a pilot from among his own
subjects, being unwilling to trust them upon the Grecian
coasts; but he sent on board some Ph&oelig;nician<sup id="t_ref029"><a href="#t_en029">29</a></sup> merchants, who,
as they are a commercial people, and trade to every port, had
nothing to fear. These men were to have returned to Acestes,
after putting us on shore at Ithaca; but the gods, who sport
with the designs of men, reserved us for other dangers."</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb02">BOOK II.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus relates his being taken in the Tyrian vessel by the fleet of
Sesostris, and carried captive into Egypt. He describes the beauty of
the country, and the wise government of its king. He relates also that
Mentor was sent a slave into Ethiopia; that he was himself reduced
to keep sheep in the deserts of Oasis; that in this state he was comforted
by Termosiris, a priest of Apollo, who taught him to imitate that
god, who had once been the shepherd of Admetus; that Sesostris, having
at length heard with astonishment what his influence and example
had effected among the shepherds, determined to see him, and being
convinced of his innocence, promised to send him to Ithaca, but that the
death of Sesostris overwhelmed him with new calamities; and that he
was imprisoned in a tower which overlooked the sea, from whence he
saw Bocchoris, the new king, slain in a battle against part of his subjects,
who had revolted, and had called in the Tyrians to their assistance.</p>

<p>"LONG had the pride of the Tyrians offended Sesostris, king
of Egypt, who had extended his dominion by the conquest of
many States.<sup id="t_ref030"><a href="#t_en030">30</a></sup> The wealth which they had acquired by commerce,
and the impregnable strength of their city, which stood
in the sea, had rendered them so insolent and presumptuous,
that they refused to pay the tribute which had been imposed
by Sesostris on his return to Egypt; and had sent troops to
the assistance of his brother, who had attempted to assassinate
him at a feast, in the midst of rejoicings that had been made
for his return.<sup id="t_ref031"><a href="#t_en031">31</a></sup></p>

<p>"Sesostris had determined to humble them, by interrupting

<!-- page 167 -->

their trade: he therefore sent out a great number of armed
vessels, with orders to take or sink the Ph&oelig;nician ships
wherever they should be found; and, just as we lost sight of
Sicily, we fell in with an Egyptian fleet.&mdash;The port and the
land seemed to retreat behind<sup id="t_ref032"><a href="#t_en032">32</a></sup> us, and lose themselves in the
clouds; and we saw the fleet advance like a floating city. The
Ph&oelig;nicians immediately perceived their danger, and would
have avoided it, but it was too late. The Egyptian vessels
sailed better than ours; the wind was in their favor; they had
a greater number of oars: they boarded us, took us without
resistance, and carried us prisoners into Egypt.</p>

<p>"I told them, indeed, that neither Mentor, nor myself, was a
Ph&oelig;nician; but they heard me with contempt. Imagining
that we were slaves, a merchandise in which they knew the
Ph&oelig;nicians traded, they thought only how to dispose of us to
the greatest advantage. We soon perceived the sea to be
whitened by the waters of the Nile, and the coast of Egypt
appeared low in the horizon. We then arrived at the island
of Pharos,<sup id="t_ref033"><a href="#t_en033">33</a></sup> near the city of No,<sup id="t_ref034"><a href="#t_en034">34</a></sup> and then we proceeded up the
Nile to Memphis.<sup id="t_ref035"><a href="#t_en035">35</a></sup></p>

<p>"If the sorrows of captivity had not rendered us insensible
to pleasure, we must have been delighted with the prospect of
this fertile country, which had the appearance of a vast garden,
watered with an infinite number of canals. Each side of the
river was diversified with opulent cities, delightful villas, fields
that produce every year a golden harvest, and meadows that
were covered with flocks: earth lavished her fruits upon the
husbandman, till he stooped under the burden; and Echo
seemed pleased to repeat the rustic music of the shepherds.</p>

<p>" 'Happy are the people,' said Mentor, 'who are governed

<!-- page 168 -->

by so wise a king! They flourish in perpetual plenty, and
love him by whom that plenty is bestowed. Thus, O Telemachus,
ought thy government to secure the happiness of thy
people, if the gods shall at length exalt thee to the throne of
thy father. Love thy subjects as thy children; and learn, from
their love of thee, to derive the happiness of a parent: teach
them to connect the idea of happiness with that of their king,
that, whenever they rejoice in the blessings of peace, they may
remember their benefactor, and honor thee with the tribute of
gratitude. The kings who are only solicitous to be feared, and
teach their subjects humility by oppression, are the scourges of
mankind. They are, indeed, objects of terror; but they are also
objects of hatred and detestation,<sup id="t_ref036"><a href="#t_en036">36</a></sup> and have more to fear from
their subjects than their subjects can have to fear from them.'</p>

<p>"I replied: 'Alas! what have we now to do with maxims
of government? With respect to us, Ithaca is no more. We
shall never again behold Penelope or our country. With
whatever glory Ulysses may at length return, to meet his son
is a joy that he shall never taste; and to obey him till I shall
learn to govern, is a pleasure that will be forever withheld
from me. Let us die then, my dear Mentor; all thoughts, but
of death, are idle speculations: let us die, since the gods have
ceased to regard us with compassion!'</p>

<p>"I was so depressed by grief, that this speech was rendered
almost unintelligible by the sighs with which it was interrupted.
But Mentor, though he was not presumptuous with respect to
future evils, was yet fearless of the present. 'Unworthy son of
the great Ulysses,' said he, 'dost thou yield to misfortunes
without resistance? Know, that the day approaches in which
thou shalt again behold thy mother and thy country. Thou
shalt behold, in the meridian of his glory, him whom thou
hast never known, the invincible Ulysses, whom fortune can
never subdue, and whose example, in more dreadful calamity

<!-- page 169 -->

than thine, may teach thee never to despair. Should he learn,
in the remote countries on which the tempest has cast him,
that his son emulates neither his patience nor his valor, the
dreadful tidings would cover him with confusion, and afflict
him more than all the horrors of his life.'</p>

<p>"Mentor then called my attention to the cheerfulness of
plenty, which was diffused over all Egypt; a country which
contained twenty-two thousand cities.<sup id="t_ref037"><a href="#t_en037">37</a></sup> He admired the policy
with which they were governed; the justice which prevented the
oppression of the poor by the rich; the education of the youth,
which rendered obedience, labor, temperance, and the love of
arts, or of literature, habitual; the punctuality in all the
solemnities of religion; the public spirit, the desire of honor
the integrity to man, and the reverence to the gods, which
were implanted by every parent in every child. He long contemplated
this beautiful order with increasing delight, and
frequently repeated his exclamations of praise. 'Happy are
the people,' said he, 'who are thus wisely governed; but more
happy is the king whose bounty is so extensively the felicity
of others, and whose virtue is the source of yet nobler enjoyment
to himself. His dominion is secured, not by terror, but
by love. His commands are received, not only with obedience,
but with joy. He reigns in the hearts of his people, who are
so far from wishing his government at an end, that they consider
his mortality with regret, and every man would rejoice
to redeem the life of his sovereign with his own.'</p>

<p>"I listened attentively to this discourse of Mentor; and,
while he spoke, I felt new courage kindling in my bosom.</p>

<p>"As soon as we arrived at Memphis, a city distinguished by
its opulence and splendor, the governor sent us forward to
Thebes,<sup id="t_ref038"><a href="#t_en038">38</a></sup> that we might be questioned by Sesostris; who, even

<!-- page 170 -->

had he been less attentive to administer his own government
would yet have examined us himself, as he was extremely
incensed against the Tyrians. We therefore proceeded up the
Nile to the celebrated city with a hundred gates, the residence
of this mighty prince. Thebes appeared to be of vast extent,
and more populous than the most flourishing city of Greece.
The regulations that are established for keeping the avenues
free from incumbrances, for maintaining the aqueducts, for rendering
the baths convenient, for the cultivation of arts, and for
the security of the public, are the most excellent that can be
imagined. The squares are decorated with fountains and obelisks;
the temples are of marble; and the architecture, though
it is simple, is majestic. The palace itself is almost as extensive
as a town, and abounds with columns of marble, pyramids, and
obelisks, statues of a prodigious magnitude, and furniture of
silver and gold.</p>

<p>"The king was informed, by those who took us, that we
were found on board a Ph&oelig;nician vessel. It was his custom to
give audience, at a certain hour every day, to all who had any
complaints to make or intelligence to communicate. No man
was either despised or rejected by Sesostris: he considered
himself as possessing the regal authority, only that he might be
the instrument of good to his people, whom he regarded with
the affection of a father. Strangers, whom he treated with
great kindness, he was very solicitous to see, because he
believed that some useful knowledge might always be acquired
by an acquaintance with the manners and customs of remote
countries.</p>

<p>"For this reason we were brought before the king. He was
seated upon a throne of ivory, and held a golden sceptre in his
hand. Though he was advanced in years his person was still
graceful,<sup id="t_ref039"><a href="#t_en039">39</a></sup> and his countenance was full of sweetness and
majesty. He sat every day to administer justice to his people;

<!-- page 171 -->

and his patience and sagacity as a judge would have vindicated
the boldest panegyrist from the imputation of flattery. Such
were the labors of the day: and to hear a discourse on
some question of science, or to converse with those whom he
knew to be worthy of his familiarity, was the entertainment of
the evening. Nor was the lustre of his life sullied by any
fault but that of having triumphed over the princes, whom he
had conquered with too much ostentation, and having confided
too much in one of his officers, whose character I shall presently
describe. When he saw me, my youth moved him to
compassion; and he inquired of me my country and my name.
We were struck with the dignity and propriety of his expression.</p>

<p>"I answered: 'Most illustrious prince, thou art not ignorant
of the siege of Troy, which endured ten years; nor of its
destruction, which exhausted Greece of her noblest blood.
Ulysses, the king of Ithaca, who is my father, was one of the
principal instruments of that great event, but is now, in search
of his kingdom, a fugitive on the deep; and, in search of him,
I am, by a like misfortune, a captive in Egypt. Restore me
once more to my father and my country; so may the gods
preserve thee to thy children; and may they rejoice under the
protection of so good a parent!'</p>

<p>"Sesostris still regarded me with compassion; but doubting
whether what I had told him was true, he gave charge of us
to one of his officers, with orders to inquire of the persons
who had taken our vessel, whether we were indeed Greeks or
Ph&oelig;nicians. 'If they are Ph&oelig;nicians,' said he, 'they will deserve
punishment, not only as our enemies, but as wretches
who have basely attempted to deceive us by falsehoods; but,
on the contrary, if they are Greeks, it is my pleasure that they
shall be treated with kindness, and sent back to their country
in one of my vessels; for I love Greece, a country which has
derived many of its laws from the wisdom of Egypt. I am not
unacquainted with the virtue of Hercules; the glory of Achilles
has reached us, however remote; I admire the wisdom that is
related of the unfortunate Ulysses; and I rejoice to alleviate
the distress of virtue.'</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

"Metophis, the officer to whom the king had referred the
examination of our affair, was as corrupt and selfish as Sesostris
was generous and sincere. He attempted to perplex us by
ensnaring questions; and, as he perceived that Mentor's answers
were more prudent than mine, he regarded him with malevolence
and suspicion; for, to the unworthy, there is no insult
so intolerable as merit. He therefore caused us to be separated;
and from that time I knew not what had become of Mentor.</p>

<p>"This separation was, to me, sudden and dreadful as a
stroke of thunder. Metophis hoped that, by interrogating us
apart, he should be able to discover some inconsistency in our
account; and yet more, that he might allure me, by promises,
to make known that which Mentor had concealed. To discover
truth was not, indeed, his principal view, but to find some
pretence to tell the king we were Ph&oelig;nicians, that we might
become his slaves. Notwithstanding our innocence, and the
king's sagacity, he succeeded.</p>

<p>"How dangerous a situation is royalty, in which the wisest
are often the tools of deceit! A throne is surrounded by a
train of subtlety and self-interest. Integrity retires, because
she will not be introduced by Importunity or Flattery. Virtue,
conscious of her own dignity, waits at a distance till she is
sought; and princes seldom know where she is to be found.
Vice, and her dependents, are impudent and fraudful, insinuating
and officious, skilful in dissimulation, and ready to
renounce all principles, and to violate every tie, when it becomes
necessary to the gratification of the appetites of a prince.
How wretched is the man who is thus perpetually exposed to
the attempts of guilt, by which he must inevitably perish, if
he does not renounce the music of adulation, and learn not to
be offended by the plainness of truth! Such were the reflections
which I made in my distress; and I revolved in my mind
all that had been said to me by Mentor.</p>

<p>"While my thoughts were thus employed, I was sent by
Metophis towards the mountains of the desert Oasis,<sup id="t_ref040"><a href="#t_en040">40</a></sup> that I

<!-- page 173 -->

might assist his slaves in looking after his flocks, which were
almost without number."</p>

<p>Calypso here interrupted Telemachus. "And what did you
then?" said she. "In Sicily, you chose death rather than
slavery."</p>

<p>"I had then," said Telemachus, "become still more wretched,
and had no longer the sad consolation of such a choice.
Slavery was irresistibly forced upon me, and I was compelled
by fortune to exhaust the dregs of her cup: I was excluded
even from hope, and every avenue to liberty was barred
against me.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, Mentor, as he has since told me, was
carried into Ethiopia, by certain natives of that country, to
whom he had been sold.</p>

<p>"The scene of my captivity was a desert, where the plain
is a burning sand, and the mountains are covered with snow.
Below was intolerable heat, above was perpetual winter. The
pasturage was thinly scattered among the rocks, the mountains
were steep and craggy, and the valleys between them were
almost inaccessible to the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>"I had no society in this dreadful situation but that of the
shepherds, who are as rude and uncultivated as the country.
Here I spent the night in bewailing my misfortunes, and the
day in following my flocks, that I might avoid the brutal insolence
of the principal slave, whose name was Butis; and
who, having conceived hopes of obtaining his freedom, was
perpetually accusing the rest, as a testimony of his zeal and
attachment to the interest of his master. This complication
of distress almost overwhelmed me; and, in the anguish of
my mind, I one day forgot my flock, and threw myself on the
ground near a cave, expecting that death would deliver me
from a calamity which I was no longer able to sustain.</p>

<p>"Just in the moment of despair, I perceived the mountain
tremble; the oaks and pines seemed to bow from the summit;
the winds were hushed. A deep voice, which seemed to issue
from the cave, pronounced these words: 'Son of the wise
Ulysses, thou must, like him, become great by patience.

<!-- page 174 -->

Princes who have not known adversity are unworthy of happiness;
they are enervated by luxury, and intoxicated with
pride. Surmount and remember these misfortunes, and thou
shalt be happy. Thou shalt return to Ithaca; and thy glory
shall fill the world. When thou shalt have dominion over
others, forget not that thou hast been like them, weak, destitute,
and afflicted; be it thy happiness, then, to afford them
comfort; love thy people; detest flattery; and remember that
no man is great, but in proportion as he restrains and subdues
his passions.'</p>

<p>"These words inspired me as the voice of heaven; joy immediately
throbbed in my veins, and courage glowed in my
bosom. Nor was I seized with that horror which so often
causes the hair to stand upright, and the blood to stagnate,
when the gods reveal themselves to men. I rose in tranquillity;
and, kneeling on the ground, I lifted up my hands to
heaven, and paid my adorations to Minerva, to whom I believed
myself indebted for this oracle. At the same time I perceived
my mind illuminated with wisdom, and was conscious of a
gentle, yet prevailing, influence which overruled all my passions,
and restrained the ardor of my youth. I acquired the
friendship of all the shepherds of the desert; and my meekness,
patience, and diligence at length obtained the good-will
even of Butis himself, who was at first disposed to treat me
with inhumanity.</p>

<p>"To shorten the tedious hours of captivity and solitude, I
endeavored to procure some books, for I sunk under the sense
of my condition, merely because I had nothing either to recreate
or to fortify my mind. 'Happy,' said I, 'are those who
have lost their relish for tumultuous pleasure, and are content
with the soothing quiet of innocence and retirement! Happy
are they whose amusement is knowledge, and whose supreme
delight is the cultivation of the mind! Wherever they shall
be driven by the persecution of Fortune, the means of employment
are still with them; and that weary listlessness, which
renders life insupportable to the voluptuous and the indolent,
is unknown to those who can employ themselves by reading.<sup id="t_ref041"><a href="#t_en041">41</a></sup>

<!-- page 175 -->

Happy are those to whom this employment is pleasing;
and who are not, like me, compelled to be idle!'</p>

<p>"While my mind was agitated by these thoughts, I had
wandered into a thick forest; and, suddenly looking up, I
perceived before me an old man with a book in his hand. His
forehead was somewhat wrinkled, and he was bald to the
crown; a beard, white as snow, hung down to his girdle; his
stature was lofty, and his port majestic; his cheeks were still
florid, and his eyes piercing; there was great sweetness in his
voice; his words were simple and engaging. I had never
seen any person whose manner and appearance so strongly excited
veneration and esteem. His name was Termosiris;<sup id="t_ref042"><a href="#t_en042">42</a></sup> he
was a priest of Apollo, and officiated in a temple of marble,
which the kings of Egypt had consecrated to that deity in the
forest. The book which he held in his hand was a collection
of hymns that had been composed in honor of the gods.</p>

<p>"He accosted me with an air of friendship; and we entered
into conversation. He related past events with such force of
expression, that they seemed to be present; and with such
comprehensive brevity, that attention was not wearied. He
foresaw the future, by a sagacity that discovered the true characters
and dispositions of mankind, and the events which they
would produce. But with all this intellectual superiority, he
was cheerful and condescending. There is no grace in the
utmost gayety of youth that was not exceeded by Termosiris
in his age. He regarded young persons with a kind of parental
affection, when he perceived that they had a disposition
to be instructed, and a love of virtue.</p>

<p>"He soon discovered a tender regard for me; and gave me
books to relieve the anxiety of my mind. He called me his

<!-- page 176 -->

son; and I frequently addressed him as a father. 'The gods,'
said I, 'who have deprived me of Mentor, have, in pity, sustained
me with thy friendship.' He was, without doubt, like
Orpheus and Linus, inspired by the gods. He often repeated
verses of his own, and gave me those of many others who had
been the favorites of the Muses. When he was habited in his
long white robes, and played upon his ivory lyre, the bears,
lions, and tigers of the forest fawned upon him, and licked his
feet; the satyrs came from their recesses and danced around
him; and it might almost have been believed, that even the
trees<sup id="t_ref043"><a href="#t_en043">43</a></sup> and rocks were influenced by the magic of his song, in
which he celebrated the majesty of the gods, the virtue of
heroes, and the wisdom of those who prefer glory to pleasure.</p>

<p>"Termosiris often excited me to courage. He told me that
the gods would never abandon either Ulysses or his son; and
that I ought, after the example of Apollo, to introduce the
shepherds to the acquaintance of the Muses. 'Apollo,' says
he, 'displeased that Jupiter frequently interrupted the serenity
of the brightest days with thunder, turned his resentment
against the Cyclops, who forged the bolts, and destroyed them
with his arrows. Immediately the fiery explosions of Mount
&AElig;tna ceased; the strokes of those enormous hammers, which
had shaken the earth to the centre, were heard no more; iron
and brass, which the Cyclops had been used to polish, began
now to rust and canker. Vulcan quitting his forge, in the
fury of his resentment, hastily climbed Olympus, notwithstanding
his lameness; and, rushing into the assembly of the
gods, covered with dust and sweat, complained of the injury
with all the bitterness of invective. Jupiter being thus incensed
against Apollo, expelled him from heaven, and threw
him down headlong to the earth. His chariot, though it was
empty, still performed its usual course; and, by an invisible

<!-- page 177 -->

impulse, continued the succession of day and night, and the
regular change of seasons to mankind.</p>

<p>" 'Apollo, divested of his rays, was compelled to become a
shepherd, and kept the flocks of Admetus, king of Thessaly.
While he was thus disgraced, and in exile, he used to soothe
his mind with music, under the shade of some elms that flourished
upon the borders of a limpid stream. This drew about
him all the neighboring shepherds, whose life till then had
been rude and brutal; whose knowledge had been confined
to the management of their sheep; and whose country had
the appearance of a desert.</p>

<p>" 'To these savages Apollo, varying the subject of his song,
taught all the arts by which existence is improved into felicity.
Sometimes he celebrated the flowers which improve the graces
of Spring, the fragrance which she diffuses, and the verdure
that rises under her feet. Sometimes he sang of the delightful
evenings of Summer, of her zephyrs that refresh mankind,
and of her dews that allay the thirst of the earth. Nor were
the golden fruits of Autumn forgotten, with which she rewards
the labor of the husbandman; nor the cheerful idleness of
Winter, who piles his fires till they emulate the sun, and invites
the youth to dancing and festivity. He described also
the gloomy forests with which the mountains are overshadowed,
and the rivers that wind with a pleasing intricacy
through the luxuriant meadows of the valley. Thus were the
shepherds of Thessaly made acquainted with the happiness
that is to be found in a rural life, by those who know how to
enjoy the beauties of nature.</p>

<p>" 'The pipes of the shepherds now rendered them more
happy than kings; and those uncorrupted pleasures, which fly
from the palace, were invited to the cottage. The shepherdesses
were followed by the Sports, the Smiles, and the Graces;
and adorned by simplicity and innocence. Every day was devoted
to joy; and nothing was to be heard but the chirping
of birds, the whispers of the zephyrs that sported among the
branches of the trees, the murmurs of water falling from a
rock, or the songs with which the Muses inspired the shepherds

<!-- page 178 -->

who followed Apollo. They were taught also to conquer in
the race, and to shoot with the bow. The gods themselves
became jealous of their happiness: they now thought the obscurity
of a shepherd better than the splendor of a deity, and
recalled Apollo to Olympus.</p>

<p>" 'By this story, my son, be thou instructed. Thou art now
in the same state with that of Apollo in his exile. Like him,
therefore, fertilize an uncultivated soil, and call plenty to a
desert; teach these rustics the power of music, soften the obdurate
heart to sensibility, and captivate the savage with the
charms of virtue. Let them taste the pleasures of innocence
and seclusion; and heighten this felicity with the transporting
knowledge, that it is not dependent upon the caprice of fortune.
The day approaches, my son, the day approaches, in
which the pains and cares that surround a throne will teach
thee to remember these wilds with regret.'</p>

<p>"Termosiris then gave me a flute, the tone of which was so
melodious, that the echoes of the mountains, which repeated
the sound, immediately brought the neighboring shepherds in
crowds about me. A divine melody was communicated to my
voice; I perceived myself to be under a supernatural influence,
and I celebrated the beauties of nature with all the rapture of
enthusiasm. We frequently sung all the day in concert, and
sometimes encroached upon the night. The shepherds, forgetting
their cottages and their flocks, were fixed motionless
as statues about me, while I instructed them. The desert became
insensibly less wild and rude; every thing assumed a
more pleasing appearance; and the country itself seemed to
be improved by the manners of the people.</p>

<p>"We often assembled to sacrifice in the temple to Apollo,
where Termosiris was priest. The shepherds wore wreaths of
laurel in honor of the gods, and the shepherdesses were
adorned with garlands of flowers, and came dancing with burdens
of consecrated gifts upon their heads. After the sacrifice,
we made a rural feast; the greatest delicacies were the
milk of our goats and sheep, and some dates, figs, grapes, and
other fruits, which were fresh gathered by our own hands;

<!-- page 179 -->

the green turf was our seat, and the foliage of the trees
afforded us a more pleasing shade than the gilded roof of a
palace.</p>

<p>"But my reputation among the shepherds was completed
by an accident: a hungry lion broke in among my flock, and
began a dreadful slaughter. I ran towards him, though I had
nothing in my hand but my sheep-hook. When he saw me,
he erected his mane: he began to grind his teeth, and to extend
his claws: his mouth appeared dry and inflamed, and his
eyes were red and fiery. I did not wait for his attack, but
rushed upon him, and threw him to the ground; nor did I receive
any hurt, for a small coat of mail that I wore, as an
Egyptian shepherd, defended me against his claws. Three
times I threw him, and he rose three times against me, roaring
so loud that the utmost recesses of the forest echoed. At last,
I grasped him till he was strangled, and the shepherds, who
were witnesses of my conquest, insisted that I should wear his
skin as a trophy.</p>

<p>"This action, and the change of manners among our shepherds,
was rumored through all Egypt, and came at length to
the ears of Sesostris. He learnt that one of the two captives,
who had been taken for Ph&oelig;nicians, had restored the golden
age in the midst of deserts which were scarcely habitable. He
desired to see me; for he was a friend of the Muses, and regarded,
with attention and complacency, whatever appeared to
be the means of instruction. I was accordingly brought before
him: he listened to my story with pleasure, and soon discovered
that he had been deceived by the avaricious Metophis.
Metophis he therefore condemned to perpetual imprisonment,
and took into his own possession the wealth that his rapacity
and injustice had heaped together. 'How unhappy,' said he
'are those whom the gods have exalted above the rest of mankind!
They see no object but through a medium which distorts
it, they are surrounded by wretches who intercept truth
in its approaches; every one imagines it is his interest to
deceive them, and every one conceals his own ambition under
the appearance of zeal for their service: that regard is professed

<!-- page 180 -->

for the prince, of which the wealth and honors that he
dispenses are the real objects; and so flagitious is the neglect
of his interest, that for these he is flattered and betrayed.'</p>

<p>"From this time Sesostris treated me with a tender friendship,
and resolved to send me back to Ithaca, in a fleet that
should carry troops sufficient to deliver Penelope from all her
suitors. This fleet was at length ready to sail, and waited only
for our embarkation. I reflected, with wonder, upon the caprice
of Fortune, who frequently most exalts those whom, the
moment before, she had most depressed. The experience of
this inconstancy encouraged me to hope that Ulysses, whatever
he should suffer, might at last return to his kingdom
My thoughts also suggested that I might again meet with
Mentor, even though he should have been carried into the remotest
parts of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>"I therefore delayed my departure a few days, that I might
make some inquiry after him; but in this interval, Sesostris,
who was very old, died suddenly; and by his death I was involved
in new calamities.</p>

<p>"This event filled all Egypt with grief and despair: every
family lamented Sesostris as its most valuable friend, its protector,
its father. The old, lifting up their hands to heaven,
uttered the most passionate exclamations: 'O Egypt, thou
hast known no king like Sesostris in the times that are past;
nor shalt thou know any like him in those that are to come!
Ye gods! ye should not have given Sesostris to mankind; or
ye should not have taken him away! O wherefore do we survive
Sesostris!' The young cried out: 'The hope of Egypt
is cut off! Our fathers were long happy under the government
of a king whom we have known only to regret!' His domestics
wept incessantly, and, during forty days, the inhabitants
of the remotest provinces came in crowds to his funeral.
Every one was eagerly solicitous yet once more to gaze upon
the body of his prince; all desired to preserve his image in
their memory; and some requested to be shut up with him in
the tomb.</p>

<p>"The loss of Sesostris was more sensibly felt, as Bocchoris,

<!-- page 181 -->

his son, was destitute of humanity to strangers and of curiosity
for science, of esteem for merit and of love of glory. The
greatness of the father contributed to degrade the son. His
education had rendered him effeminately voluptuous and brutally
proud; he looked down upon mankind as creatures of an
inferior species, that existed only for his pleasure: he thought
only of gratifying his passions, and of dissipating the immense
treasures that had been amassed for public use by the economy
of his father; of procuring new resources for extravagances by
the most cruel rapacity; of impoverishing the rich, of famishing
the poor, and of perpetrating every other evil that was
advised by the beardless sycophants whom he permitted to
disgrace his presence, while he drove away with derision the
hoary sages in whom his father had confided. Such was Bocchoris;
not a king, but a monster. Egypt groaned under his
tyranny; and though the reverence of the people for the
memory of Sesostris rendered them patient under the government
of his son, however odious and cruel, yet he precipitated
his own destruction; and, indeed, it was impossible that he
should long possess a throne which he so little deserved.</p>

<p>"My hopes of returning to Ithaca were now at an end. I
was shut up in a tower that stood on the sea-shore near Pelusium,<sup id="t_ref044"><a href="#t_en044">44</a></sup>
where we should have embarked, if the death of Sesostris
had not prevented us; for, Metophis having by some intrigue
procured his enlargement and an admission into the
councils of the young king, almost the first act of his power
was to imprison me in this place, to revenge the disgrace into
which I had brought him. There I passed whole days and
nights in the agonies of despair. All that Termosiris had predicted,
and all that I had heard in the cave, was remembered
but as a dream. Sometimes, while I was absorbed in reflections
upon my own misery, I stood gazing at the waves that
broke against the foot of the tower; and sometimes I contemplated

<!-- page 182 -->

the vessels that were agitated by the tempest, and in
danger of driving against the rocks upon which the tower was
built; but I was so far from commiserating those who were
threatened with shipwreck, that I regarded them with envy,
'Their misfortunes,' said I to myself, 'and their lives, will
quickly be at an end together, or they will return in safety to
their country.  Alas! I can hope for neither.'</p>

<p>"One day, while I was thus pining with ineffectual sorrow,
I suddenly perceived the masts of ships at a distance like a
forest. The sea was presently covered with sails swelling with
the wind, and the waves foamed with the strokes of innumerable
oars. I heard a confused sound on every side. On the
sea-coast, I perceived one party of Egyptians run to arms with
terror and precipitation, and another waiting quietly for the
fleet which was bearing down upon them. I soon discovered
that some of these vessels were of Ph&oelig;nicia, and others of
Cyprus; for my misfortunes had acquainted me with many
things that relate to navigation. The Egyptians appeared to
be divided among themselves; and I could easily believe that
the folly and the violence of Bocchoris had provoked his subjects
to a revolt, and had kindled a civil war: nor was it long
before I became a spectator of an obstinate engagement from
the top of my tower.</p>

<p>"Those Egyptians who had called in the assistance of the
foreign powers, after having favored the descent, attacked the
other party, which was commanded by the king, and animated
by his example. He appeared like the god<sup id="t_ref045"><a href="#t_en045">45</a></sup> of war; rivers of
blood flowed around him; the wheels of his chariot were
smeared with gore that was black, clotted, and frothy, and
could scarcely be dragged over the heaps of slain, which they
crushed as they passed. His figure was graceful and vigorous,
his aspect was haughty and fierce, and his eyes sparkled
with rage and despair.  Like a high-spirited horse that had

<!-- page 183 -->

never been broken, he was precipitated upon danger by his
courage, and his valor was not directed by wisdom. He knew
not how to retrieve an error, nor to give orders with sufficient
exactness. He neither foresaw the evils that threatened him,
nor employed the troops he had to the greatest advantage,
though he was in the utmost need of more. Not that he wanted
abilities, for his understanding was equal to his courage, but he
had never been instructed by adversity: those who had been
intrusted with his education had corrupted an excellent natural
disposition by flattery. He was intoxicated with the consciousness
of his power, and the advantages of his situation; he believed
that every thing ought to yield to the impetuosity of his
wishes, and the least appearance of opposition transported him
with rage; he was then deaf to the expostulations of reason,
and had no longer the power of recollection. The fury of his
pride transformed him to a brute, and left him neither the affections
nor the understanding of a man; the most faithful of
his servants fled terrified from his presence; and he was gentle
only to the most abject servility, and the most criminal
compliance. Thus his conduct, always violent, was always
directly opposite to his interest, and he was detested by all
whose approbation is to be desired.</p>

<p>"His valor now sustained him long against a multitude of
his enemies; but, at length, the dart of a Ph&oelig;nician entered
his breast: the reins dropped from his hands, and he fell from
his chariot under the feet of his horses. A soldier of the isle
of Cyprus immediately struck off his head, and, holding it up
by the hair, showed it to the confederates as a trophy of their
victory.</p>

<p>"Of this head no time or circumstance can ever obliterate
the memory: methinks I still see it dropping blood&mdash;the eyes
closed and sunk&mdash;the visage pale and disfigured&mdash;the mouth
half open, as if it would still finish the interrupted silence&mdash;and
the look which, even in death, was haughty and threatening.
Nor shall I forget, if the gods hereafter place me upon a throne,
so dreadful a demonstration that a king is not worthy to command,
nor can be happy in the exercise of his power, but in

<!-- page 184 -->

proportion as he is himself obedient to reason. Alas! how
deplorable is his state, who, by the perversion of that power
with which the gods have invested him as the instrument of
public happiness, diffuses misery among the multitudes that
he governs, and who is known to be a king only as he is a
curse!"</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb03">BOOK III.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus relates that, the successor of Bocchoris releasing all the Tyrian
prisoners, he was himself sent to Tyre, on board the vessel of Narbal,
who had commanded the Tyrian fleet; that Narbal gave him a description
of Pygmalion their king, and expressed apprehensions of danger
from the cruelty of his avarice; that he afterwards instructed him in
the commercial regulations of Tyre; and that, being about to embark in
a Cyprian vessel, in order to proceed by the isle of Cyprus to Ithaca,
Pygmalion discovered that he was a stranger, and ordered him to be
seized; that his life was thus brought into the most imminent danger,
but that he had been preserved by the tyrant's mistress Astarbe, that
she might, in his stead, destroy a young Lyctian of whom she had been
enamored, but who rejected her for another; that he finally embarked
in a Cyprian vessel, to return to Ithaca by the way of Cyprus.</p>

<p>CALYPSO was greatly astonished at the wisdom which she
discovered in Telemachus. She was delighted with his ingenuous
confession of the errors into which he had been betrayed
by the precipitation of his own resolutions, and by his neglect
of Mentor's counsel. She was surprised to perceive in the
youth such strength and dignity of mind, as enabled him to
judge of his own actions with impartiality, and, by a review
of the failings of his life, become prudent, cautious, and deliberate.
"Proceed," said she, "my dear Telemachus; for I am
impatient to know by what means you escaped from Egypt, and
where you again found Mentor, whose loss you had so much
reason to regret."  Telemachus then continued his relation.</p>

<p>"The party of Egyptians who had preserved their virtue
and their loyalty, being greatly inferior to the rebels, were
obliged to yield when the king fell. Another prince, whose
name was Termutis, was established in his stead. The Ph&oelig;nician
and Cyprian troops, after they had concluded a treaty
with him, departed. By this treaty, all the Ph&oelig;nician prisoners
were to be restored; and, as I was deemed one of the

<!-- page 186 -->

number, I was set at liberty, and put on board with the rest,&mdash;a
change of fortune that once more dissipated the gloom of
despair, and diffused the dawn of hope in my bosom. Our
sails were now swelled by a prosperous wind,&mdash;the foaming
waves were divided by our oars,&mdash;the spacious deep was covered
with vessels,&mdash;the mariners shouted,&mdash;the shores of Egypt
fled from us,&mdash;and the hills and mountains grew level by degrees.
Our view began to be bounded only by the sea and
the sky, while the sparkling fires of the sun, which was rising,
seemed to emerge from the abyss of the waters; his rays
tinged with gold the tops of the mountains, which were still
just to be perceived in the horizon; and the deep azure with
which the whole firmament was painted, was an omen of a
happy voyage.</p>

<p>"Though I had been dismissed as a Ph&oelig;nician, yet I was
not known to any of those with whom I embarked. Narbal,
who commanded the vessel, asked me my name and my country.
'Of what city of Ph&oelig;nicia are you?' said he. 'Of none,'
I replied; 'but I was taken at sea in a Ph&oelig;nician vessel, and,
as a Ph&oelig;nician, remained a captive in Egypt: under this name
have I been long a slave; and by this name I am at length
set free.' 'Of what country are you then?' said Narbal. 'I
am,' said I, 'Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, king of Ithaca&mdash;an
island of Greece. My father has acquired a mighty name
among the confederate princes who laid siege to Troy; but the
gods have not permitted him to return to his kingdom. I
have sought him in many countries; and am, like him, persecuted
by Fortune. I am wretched, though my life is private,
and my wishes are few; I am wretched, though I desire no
happiness but the endearments of my family and the protection
of my father.'</p>

<p>"Narbal gazed upon me with astonishment, and thought he
perceived in my aspect something that distinguishes the favorites
of heaven. He was, by nature, generous and sincere; my
misfortunes excited his compassion; and he addressed me with
a confidence which the gods, doubtless, inspired for my preservation
in the most imminent danger.</p>

<!-- page 187 -->

<p>" 'Telemachus,' said he, 'I doubt not the truth of what you
have told me; such, indeed, are the signs of candor and integrity
which I discover in your countenance, that it is not in my
power to suspect you of falsehood. I am irresistibly determined,
by a secret impulse, to believe that you are beloved by
the gods, whom I have always served, and that it is their
pleasure I also should love you as my son. I will, therefore,
give you salutary counsel, for which I ask no return but
secrecy.' 'Fear not,' I said, 'that I should find it difficult to
be silent; for, however young, it is long since I learned not to
reveal my own secret, much less not to betray, under any pretence,
the secret of another.' 'By what means,' he inquired,
'could the habit of secrecy be acquired by a child? I should
rejoice to learn how that may be attained early, without which
a prudent conduct is impossible, and every other qualification
useless.'</p>

<p>" 'I have been informed,' I answered, 'that when Ulysses
went to the siege of Troy, he placed me upon his knees, threw
his arms about me, and after he had kissed me with the utmost
tenderness, pronounced these words, though I could not then
understand their import: "O my son, may the gods ordain
me to perish before I see thee again, or may the Fatal Sisters
cut the thread of thy life while it is yet short, as the reaper
cuts down a tender flower that is but beginning to bloom,
may my enemies dash thee in pieces before the eyes of thy
mother and of me, if thou art one day to be corrupted and
seduced from virtue! O my friends, I leave with you this son,
whom I so tenderly love: watch over his infancy; if you have
any love for me, keep flattery far from him; teach him self-mastery;
and, while he is yet flexible, like a young plant, keep
him upright. Above all, let nothing be forgotten that may
render him just, beneficent, sincere, and secret. He that is
capable of a lie, deserves not the name of a man; and he that
knows not how to be silent, is not worthy to reign."</p>

<p>" 'I have repeated to you the very words of Ulysses, because
to me they have been repeated so often, that they perpetually
occur to my mind; and I frequently repeat them to myself.</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>" 'The friends of my father began very early to teach me
secrecy, by giving me frequent opportunities to practice it; and
I made so rapid a progress in the art, that, while I was yet an
infant, they communicated to me their apprehensions from the
crowd of presumptuous rivals that addressed my mother. At
that time they treated me not as a child, but as a man, whose
reason might assist them, and in whose firmness they could
confide: they frequently conferred with me, in private, upon
the most important affairs; and communicated the schemes
which had been formed to deliver Penelope from her suitors.
I exulted in this confidence, which I considered as a proof of
my real dignity and importance. I was, therefore, ambitious
to sustain my character, and never suffered the least intimation
of what had been intrusted to me as a secret, to escape me.
The suitors often engaged me to talk, hoping that a child who
had seen or heard any circumstance of importance, would
relate it without caution or design; but I had learnt to answer
them, without forfeiting my veracity or disclosing my secret.'</p>

<p>"Narbal then addressed me in these terms: 'You see,
Telemachus, of what power the Ph&oelig;nicians are possessed, and
how much their innumerable fleets are dreaded by the neighboring
nations. The commerce which they have extended to
the Pillars of Hercules,<sup id="t_ref046"><a href="#t_en046">46</a></sup> has given them riches which the most
flourishing countries cannot supply to themselves. Even the
great Sesostris could never have prevailed against them at sea;
and the veterans, by whom he had subjugated all the East,
found it extremely difficult to conquer them in the field. He
imposed a tribute, which they have long neglected to pay; for
they are too sensible of their own wealth and power to stoop
patiently under the yoke of subjection: they have, therefore,
thrown it off; and the war which Sesostris commenced against
them has been terminated by his death. The power of Sesostris
was, indeed, rendered formidable by his policy; but when

<!-- page 189 -->

without his policy his power descended to his son, it was no
longer to be dreaded; and the Egyptians, instead of entering
Ph&oelig;nicia with a military force, to reduce to obedience a
revolted people, have been compelled to call in the assistance
of the Ph&oelig;nicians, to deliver them from the oppression of an
impious tyrant. This deliverance the Ph&oelig;nicians have effected,
and added new glory to independence, and new power to wealth.</p>

<p>" 'But while we deliver others, we are slaves ourselves. O
Telemachus, do not rashly put your life in the hands of Pygmalion,
our king. His hands are already stained with the
blood of Sich&aelig;us, the husband of Dido his sister; and Dido,<sup id="t_ref047"><a href="#t_en047">47</a></sup>
impatient to revenge his death, has fled, with the greater part
of the friends of virtue and liberty, in a numerous fleet from
Tyre, and has laid the foundations of a magnificent city on the
coast of Africa, which she calls Carthage. An insatiable thirst
of riches renders Pygmalion every day more wretched and
more detestable. In his dominions it is a crime to be wealthy:
avarice makes him jealous, suspicious, and cruel: he persecutes
the rich, and he dreads the poor.</p>

<p>" 'But, at Tyre, to be virtuous is yet a greater crime than to
be wealthy; for Pygmalion supposes that virtue cannot patiently
endure a conduct that is unjust and infamous; and, as
virtue is an enemy to Pygmalion, Pygmalion is an enemy to
virtue. Every incident torments him with inquietude, perplexity,
and apprehension; he is terrified at his own shadow;
and sleep is a stranger to his eyes. The gods have punished
him by heaping treasures before him which he does not dare
to enjoy; and that in which alone he seeks for happiness is
the source of his misery. He regrets whatever he gives; he
dreads the loss of the wealth which he possesses, and sacrifices
every comfort to the acquisition of more.</p>

<p>" 'He is scarcely ever to be seen, but sits in the inmost
recess of his palace, alone, pensive, and dejected; his friends
dare not approach him, for to approach him is to be suspected
as an enemy.  A guard, with swords drawn, and pikes levelled,

<!-- page 190 -->

surrounds his dwelling with a horrid security. The apartment
in which he hides himself consists of thirty chambers,
which communicate with each other, and to each of which
there is an iron door with six bolts. It is never known in
which of these chambers he passes the night; and it is said,
that, the better to secure himself against assassination, he never
sleeps in the same two nights together.<sup id="t_ref048"><a href="#t_en048">48</a></sup> He is equally insensible
to the joys of society, and to the more refined and tender
delights of friendship. If he is excited to the pursuit of
pleasure, he perceives that pleasure is far from him, and sits
down in despair. His eyes are hollow, eager, and piercing;
and he is continually looking round him with a restless and
inquisitive suspicion. At every noise, however trivial, he
starts, listens, is alarmed, and trembles. He is pale and emaciated;
the gloom of care is diffused over his countenance,
and his brow is contracted into wrinkles. He seldom speaks,
but he sighs perpetually. The remorse and anguish of his
mind are discovered by groans, which he endeavors in vain to
suppress. The richest delicacies of his table are tasteless.
His children,<sup id="t_ref049"><a href="#t_en049">49</a></sup> whom he has made his most dangerous enemies,
are not the objects of hope, but of terror. He believes himself
to be in perpetual danger, and attempts his own preservation
by cutting off all those whom he fears; not knowing that
cruelty, in which alone he confides for safety, will inevitably
precipitate his destruction, and that some of his domestics,
dreading the effects of his caprice and suspicion, will suddenly
deliver the world of so horrid a monster.</p>

<p>" 'As for me, I fear the gods; and will, at whatever hazard,
continue faithful to the king whom they have set over me. I
had rather he should take away my life than lift my hand

<!-- page 191 -->

against his, or neglect to defend him against the attempts of
another. But do not you, O Telemachus, acquaint him with
the name of your father; for he will then certainly shut you
up in prison, hoping that Ulysses, when he returns to Ithaca,
will pay him a large sum for your ransom.'</p>

<p>"When we arrived at Tyre, I followed the counsel of Narbal,
and was soon convinced that all he had related was true;
though before, I could scarcely conceive it possible for any man
to render himself so extremely wretched as he had represented
Pygmalion.</p>

<p>"I was the more sensibly touched at the appearances of his
tyranny and wretchedness, as they had the force of novelty,
and I said to myself: 'This is the man who has been seeking
happiness, and imagined it was to be found in unlimited power
and inexhaustible wealth. Wealth and power he has acquired,
but the acquisition has made him miserable. If he were a
shepherd, as I lately have been, he would be equally happy in
the enjoyment of rural pleasures, which, as they are innocent,
are never regretted; he would fear neither daggers nor poison,
but would be the love and the lover of mankind; he would not
indeed possess that immense treasure, which, to him who hides
it, is useless as a heap of sand, but he would rejoice in the
bounty of nature, by which every want would be supplied. He
appears to act only by the dictates of his own will; but he is,
indeed, the slave of appetite: he is condemned to do the
drudgery of avarice, and to smart under the scourge of fear
and suspicion. He appears to have dominion over others, but
he is not the master even of himself; for, in every irregular
passion, he has not only a master, but a tormentor.'</p>

<p>"Such were my reflections upon the condition of Pygmalion,
without having seen him&mdash;for he was seen by none; and his
people could only gaze, with a kind of secret dread, upon
those lofty towers, which were surrounded night and day by
his guards, and in which he had immured himself, with his
treasures, as in a prison. I compared this invisible king with
Sesostris, the mild, the affable, the good; who was so easy of
access to his subjects, and so desirous to converse with

<!-- page 192 -->

strangers; so attentive to all who wish to be heard, and so
inquisitive after truth, which those who surround a throne are
solicitous to conceal. 'Sesostris,' said I, 'feared nothing, and
had nothing to fear; he showed himself to all his subjects as
to his children; but by Pygmalion, every thing is to be feared,
and he fears every thing. This execrable tyrant is in perpetual
danger of a violent death, even in the centre of his inaccessible
palace, and surrounded by his guards; but the good Sesostris
when his people were gathered in crowds about him, was in
perfect safety, like a kind father, who, in his own house, is surrounded
by his children.'</p>

<p>"Pygmalion gave orders to send back the troops of the isle
of Cyprus, who, to fulfil a treaty, had assisted his own in their
expedition to Egypt; and Narbal took this opportunity to set
me at liberty. He caused me to pass in review among the
Cyprian soldiers; for the king always inquired into the minutest
incidents with the most scrupulous suspicion.</p>

<p>"The failing of negligent and indolent princes is the giving
themselves up, with a boundless and implicit confidence, to the
discretion of some crafty and iniquitous favorite. The failing
of Pygmalion was to suspect the most ingenuous and upright.
He knew not how to distinguish the native features of integrity
from the mask of dissimulation; for the good, who disdained
to approach so corrupt a prince, he had never seen. He had
been so often defrauded and betrayed, and had so often detected
every species of vice under the semblance of virtue, in the
wretches who were about him, that he imagined every man
walked in disguise, that virtue existed only in idea, and that all
men were nearly the same. When he found one man fraudulent
and corrupt, he took no care to displace him for another,
because he took it for granted that another would be as bad.
And he had a worse opinion of those in whom he discovered
an appearance of merit, than of those who were most openly
vicious; because he believed them to be equally knaves, and
greater hypocrites.</p>

<p>"But to return to myself. The piercing suspicion of the
king did not distinguish me from the Cyprian soldiers; but

<!-- page 193 -->

Narbal trembled for fear of a discovery, which would have
been fatal both to him and to me; he, therefore, expressed the
utmost impatience to see me embark; but I was detained at
Tyre a considerable time by contrary winds.</p>

<p>"During this interval I acquainted myself with the manners
of the Ph&oelig;nicians, a people that had become famous through
all the known world. I admired the situation of their city,
which is built upon an island in the midst of the sea. The
neighboring coast is rendered extremely delightful by its uncommon
fertility, the exquisite flavor of its fruits, the number
of towns and villages which are almost contiguous to each
other, and the excellent temperature of the climate: it is
sheltered by a ridge of mountains from the burning winds that
pass over the southern continent, and refreshed by the northern
breezes that blow from the sea. It is situated at the foot of
Libanus,<sup id="t_ref050"><a href="#t_en050">50</a></sup> whose head is concealed within the clouds, and hoary
with everlasting frost. Torrents of water, mingled with snow,
rush from the craggy precipices that surround it; and at a
small distance below is a vast forest of cedars, which appear to
be as ancient as the earth, and almost as lofty as the sky. The
declivity of the mountain, below the forest, is covered with
pasture, where innumerable cattle and sheep are continually
feeding among a thousand rivulets of the purest water. At the
foot of the mountain, below the pastures, the plain has the appearance
of a garden, where spring and autumn seem to unite
their influence to produce at once both flowers and fruit, which
are never parched by the pestilential heat of the southern
blast, nor blighted by the piercing cold of the northern tempest.</p>

<p>"Near this delightful coast, the island on which Tyre is built
emerges from the sea. The city seems to float upon the
waters, and looks like the sovereign of the deep. It is crowded
with merchants of every nation, and its inhabitants are themselves
the most eminent merchants of the world. It appears,
at first, not to be the city of any particular people, but to be

<!-- page 194 -->

common to all, as the centre of their commerce. There are
two large moles, which, like two arms stretched out into
the sea, embrace a spacious harbor, which is a shelter from
every wind. The vessels in this harbor are so numerous, as
almost to hide the water in which they float; and the masts
look at a distance like a forest. All the citizens of Tyre apply
themselves to trade; and their wealth does not render them
impatient of that labor by which it is increased. Their city
abounds with the finest linen of Egypt, and cloth that has
been doubly dyed with the Tyrian purple<sup id="t_ref051"><a href="#t_en051">51</a></sup>&mdash;a color which has
a lustre that time itself can scarcely diminish, and which they
frequently heighten by embroidery of gold and silver. The
commerce of the Ph&oelig;nicians extends to the Straits of Gades;<sup id="t_ref052"><a href="#t_en052">52</a></sup>
they have even entered the vast ocean by which the world is
encircled, and made long voyages upon the Red Sea to islands
which are unknown to the rest of mankind, from whence they
bring gold, perfumes, and many animals that are to be found
in no other country.</p>

<p>"I gazed with insatiable curiosity upon this great city, in
which every thing was in motion; and where none of those
idle and inquisitive persons<sup id="t_ref053"><a href="#t_en053">53</a></sup> are to be found, who, in Greece,
saunter about the public places in quest of news, or observe
the foreigners who come on shore in the port. The men are
busied in loading the vessels, in sending away or in selling
their merchandise, in putting their warehouses in order, or in
keeping an account of the sums due to them from foreign
merchants. The women are constantly employed in spinning
wool, in drawing patterns for embroidery, or in folding up rich
stuffs.</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>" 'By what means,' said I to Narbal, 'have the Ph&oelig;nicians
monopolized the commerce of the world, and enriched themselves
at the expense of every other nation?' 'You see the
means,' answered Narbal; 'the situation of Tyre renders it fit
for commerce; and the invention of navigation is the peculiar
glory of our country. If the accounts are to be believed that
are transmitted to us from the most remote antiquity, the
Tyrians rendered the waves subservient to their purpose long
before Typhis and the Argonauts<sup id="t_ref054"><a href="#t_en054">54</a></sup> became the boast of Greece:
they were the first who defied the rage of the billows and the
tempest on a few floating planks, and fathomed the abysses of
the ocean. They reduced the theories of Egyptian and Babylonian<sup id="t_ref055"><a href="#t_en055">55</a></sup>
science to practice, regulating their course, where there
was no landmark, by the stars;<sup id="t_ref056"><a href="#t_en056">56</a></sup> and they brought innumerable
nations together which the sea had separated. The Tyrians
are ingenious, persevering, and laborious; they have,
besides, great manual dexterity, and are remarkable for temperance
and frugality. The laws are executed with the most
scrupulous punctuality; and the people are, among themselves,
perfectly unanimous; and to strangers, they are, above all
others, friendly, courteous, and faithful.<sup id="t_ref057"><a href="#t_en057">57</a></sup></p>

<p>" 'Such are the means&mdash;nor is it necessary to seek for any
other&mdash;by which they have subjected the sea to their dominion,
and included every nation in their commerce. But if
jealousy and faction should break in among them; if they
should be seduced by pleasure, or by indolence; if the great
should regard labor and economy with contempt, and the
manual arts should no longer be deemed honorable; if public
faith should not be kept with the stranger, and the laws of
a free commerce should be violated; if manufactures should

<!-- page 196 -->

be neglected, and those sums spared which are necessary to
render every commodity perfect in its kind;&mdash;that power,
which is now the object of your admiration, would soon be at
an end.'</p>

<p>" 'But how,' said I, 'can such a commerce be established at
Ithaca?' 'By the same means,' said he, 'that I have established
it here. Receive all strangers with readiness and hospitality:
let them find safety, convenience, and liberty in your
ports; and be careful never to disgust them by avarice or
pride. He that would succeed in a project of gain, must never
attempt to gain too much, and upon proper occasions must
know how to lose. Endeavor to gain the good-will of foreigners;
rather suffer some injury than offend them by doing justice
to yourself; and especially, do not keep them at a distance
by a haughty behavior. Let the laws of trade be neither
complicated nor burdensome; but do not violate them yourself,
nor suffer them to be violated with impunity. Always punish
fraud with severity; nor let even the negligence or prodigality
of a trader escape; for follies as well as vice effectually ruin
trade, by ruining those who carry it on. But above all, never
restrain the freedom of commerce, by rendering it subservient
to your own immediate gain. The pecuniary advantages
of commerce should be left wholly to those by whose labor it
subsists, lest this labor, for want of a sufficient motive, should
cease. There are more than equivalent advantages of another
kind, which must necessarily result to the prince, from the
wealth which a free commerce will bring into his State. Commerce
is a kind of spring, which, diverted from its natural
channel, ceases to flow. There are but two things which invite
foreigners&mdash;profit and convenience. If you render commerce
less convenient, or less gainful, they will insensibly
forsake you. Those that once depart will never return; because
other nations, taking advantage of your imprudence,
will invite them to their ports, and a habit will soon be contracted
of trading without you. It must indeed be confessed,
that the glory even of Tyre has for some time been obscured.
O my dear Telemachus, hadst thou beheld it before the reign

<!-- page 197 -->

of Pygmalion, how much greater would have been thy astonishment!
The remains of Tyre only are now to be seen&mdash;ruins
which have yet the appearance of magnificence, but will
shortly be mingled with the dust. O unhappy Tyre, to what
a wretch art thou subjected!&mdash;thou to whom, as to the sovereign
of the world, the sea so lately rolled the tribute of
every nation!</p>

<p>" 'Both strangers and subjects are equally dreaded by Pygmalion.
Instead of throwing open our ports to traders of the
most remote countries, like his predecessors, without any stipulation
or inquiry, he demands an exact account of the number
of vessels that arrive, the countries to which they belong,
the name of every person on board, the manner of their trading,
the kind and value of their commodities, and the time
they are to continue upon his Coast. Nor is this the worst;
for he puts in practice all the little artifices of cunning to draw
the foreign merchants into some breach of his innumerable
regulations, that under the appearance of justice he may confiscate
their goods. He is perpetually harassing those whom
he imagines to be most wealthy, and increasing, under various
pretences, the incumbrances of trade, by multiplying taxes.
He affects to trade himself; but every one is afraid to deal
with him. Thus commerce languishes; foreigners forget, by
degrees, the way to Tyre, with which they were once so well
acquainted; and if Pygmalion persists in a conduct so impolitic
and so injurious, our glory and our power will be transferred
to some other nation which is better governed.'</p>

<p>"I then inquired of Narbal by what means the Tyrians had
become so powerful at sea; for I was not willing to be ignorant
of any of the arts of government. 'We have,' said he, 'the
forests of Lebanon,<sup id="t_ref058"><a href="#t_en058">58</a></sup> which furnish sufficient timber for building
ships; and we are careful to reserve it all for that purpose,
never suffering a single tree to be felled but for the

<!-- page 198 -->

use of the public. We have also a great number of artificers,<sup id="t_ref059"><a href="#t_en059">59</a></sup>
who excel in naval architecture.'</p>

<p>" 'How have you been able to procure these artificers?' I
inquired.</p>

<p>" 'They are the gradual produce,' said he, 'of our own
country. When those who excel in any art are constantly and
liberally rewarded, it will soon be practised in the greatest
possible perfection; for persons of the highest abilities will always
apply themselves to those arts by which great rewards
are to be obtained. But, besides pecuniary rewards, whoever
excels in any art or science upon which navigation depends,
receives great honor. A good geometrician is much respected;
an able astronomer yet more; and no rewards are
thought too great for a pilot who excels in his profession. A
skilful carpenter is not only well paid, but treated well. Even
a dexterous rower is sure of a reward proportionate to his services;
his provision is the best of its kind; proper care is
taken of him when he is sick, and of his wife and children
when he is absent; and if he perish by shipwreck, his family
is provided for. Those who have been in the service a certain
number of years are dismissed with honor, and enabled to
spend the remainder of their days without labor or solicitude.
We are, therefore, never in want of skilful mariners; for it is
the ambition of every father to qualify his son for so advantageous
a calling. Boys, almost as soon as they can walk, are
taught to handle an oar, to manage the sails, and to despise a
storm. Men are thus rendered willingly subservient to the
purposes of government, by an administration so regular that
it operates with the force of custom; and by rewards so certain,
that the impulse of hope is irresistible. By authority
alone little can ever be effected. Mere obedience, like that of
a vassal to his lord, is not sufficient; obedience must be animated
by affection, and men must find their advantage in
that labor which is necessary to effect the purposes of others.</p>

<!-- page 199 -->

<p>"After this discourse Narbal carried me to the public storehouses,
the arsenals, and all the manufactories that related to
shipping. I inquired minutely into every article, and wrote
down all that I learnt, lest some useful circumstances should
afterwards be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Yet Narbal, who was well acquainted with the temper of
Pygmalion, and had conceived a zealous affection for me, was
still impatient for my departure, dreading a discovery by the
king's spies, who were night and day going about the city;
but the wind would not yet permit me to embark. One day
while we were busied in examining the harbor with more than
common attention, and questioning several merchants about
commercial affairs, one of Pygmalion's officers came up to
Narbal, and said: 'The king has just learnt, from the captain
of one of the vessels which returned with you from Egypt,
that you have brought hither a foreigner, who passes for a native
of Cyprus. It is the king's pleasure that this person be
immediately secured, and the country to which he belongs
certainly known, and for this you are to answer with your
head.' Just at this moment, I had left Narbal at a distance,
to examine more nearly the proportions of a Tyrian vessel
which was almost new, and which was said to be the best
sailer that had ever entered the port; and I was then putting
some questions to the shipwright under whose directions it
had been built.</p>

<p>"Narbal answered with the utmost consternation and terror,
'that the foreigner was really a native of the island of Cyprus,
and that he would immediately go in search of him;' but the
moment the officer was out of sight, he ran to me and acquainted
me with my danger. 'My apprehensions,' said he,
'were but too just. My dear Telemachus, our ruin is inevitable:
the king, who is night and day tormented with mistrust,
suspects that you are not a Cyprian, and has commanded me
to secure your person under pain of death. What shall we
do? May the gods deliver us by more than human wisdom,
or we perish! I must produce you to the king, but do you
confidently affirm that you are a Cyprian of the city of Amathus,

<!-- page 200 -->

and son of a statuary of Venus. I will confirm your
account, by declaring that I was formerly acquainted with
your father; and perhaps the king, without entering into a
more severe scrutiny, will suffer you to depart. I see no
other expedient, by which a chance of life can be procured
for us both.'</p>

<p>"To this counsel of Narbal, I answered: 'Let an unhappy
wretch perish, whose destruction is the decree of fate. I can
die without terror; and I would not involve you in my calamity,
because I would live without ingratitude; but I cannot
consent to lie. I am a Greek; and to say that I am a Cyprian,
is to cease to be a man. The gods, who know my sincerity,
may, if it is consistent with their wisdom, preserve me
by their power; but fear shall never seduce me to attempt my
own preservation by falsehood.'</p>

<p>" 'This falsehood,' answered Narbal, 'is wholly without
guilt, nor can it be condemned even by the gods: it will injure
none; it will preserve the innocent; and it will not otherwise
deceive the king, than as it will prevent his incurring the
guilt of cruelty and injustice. Your love of virtue is romantic,
and your zeal for religion superstitious.'</p>

<p>" 'That it is a falsehood,' said I, 'is to me sufficient proof
that it can never become a man who speaks in the presence of
the gods, and is under perpetual and unlimited obligations to
truth. He who violates truth, as he counteracts the dictates
of conscience, must offend the gods and injure himself. Do
not, therefore, urge me to a conduct that is unworthy both of
you and of me. If the gods regard us with pity, they can
easily effect our deliverance; and if they suffer us to perish,
we shall die martyrs of truth, and leave one example to mankind,
that virtue has been preferred to life. My life has been
already too long, since it has only been a series of misfortunes;
and it is the danger of yours only, my dear Narbal, that I regret.
Why, alas, should your friendship for a wretched fugitive
be fatal to yourself!'</p>

<p>"This dispute, which had continued a considerable time, was
at length interrupted by the arrival of a person, who had run

<!-- page 201 -->

till he was not able immediately to speak; but we soon learnt
that he was another of the king's officers, and had been dispatched
by Astarbe.</p>

<p>"Astarbe had beauty that appeared to be more than human,
and a mind that had almost the power of fascination. Her
general manner was sprightly, her particular address soft and
insinuating. But with all this power to please, she was, like
the Syrens, cruel and malignant. She knew how to conceal
the worst purposes by inscrutable dissimulation. She had
gained an absolute ascendency over Pygmalion by her beauty
and her wit, by the sweetness of her song, and the harmony
of her lyre. Pygmalion, in the ardor of his passion for this
mistress, had put away Topha his queen. He thought only
how he should gratify Astarbe, who was enterprising and ambitious;
and his avarice, however infamous, was scarcely a
greater curse than his extravagant fondness for this woman.
But though he was passionately enamored of her, she regarded
him with contempt and aversion; she disguised her
real sentiments, and appeared to desire life itself only as the
means of enjoying his society, at the very moment in which
her heart sickened at his approach.</p>

<p>"At this time there was, at Tyre, a young Lyctian<sup id="t_ref060"><a href="#t_en060">60</a></sup> named
Malachon, who was extremely beautiful, but dissolute, voluptuous,
and effeminate. His principal care was to preserve the
delicacy of his complexion, to spread his flaxen hair in
ringlets over his shoulders, to perfume his person, adjust his
dress, and chant amorous ditties to the music of his lyre. Of
this youth Astarbe became enamored to distraction. He
declined her favors, because he was himself equally enamored
of another, and dreaded the jealousy of the king. Astarbe
perceived herself slighted; and, in the rage of disappointment,
resolved that he who rejected her love should at least gratify
her revenge.  She thought of representing Malachon to the

<!-- page 202 -->

king as the stranger whom he had been informed Narbal had
brought into Tyre, and after whom he had caused inquiry to
be made.</p>

<p>"In this fraud she succeeded by her own arts of persuasion,
and by bribing to secrecy all who might have discovered it to
Pygmalion. As he neither loved virtue himself, nor could
discover it in others, he was surrounded by abandoned mercenaries,
who would, without scruple, execute his commands,
however iniquitous and cruel. To these wretches the authority
of Astarbe was formidable; and they assisted her to deceive
the king, lest they should give offence to an imperious woman,
who monopolized his confidence. Thus Malachon, though
known to be a Lyctian by the whole city, was cast into prison,
as the foreigner whom Narbal had brought out of Egypt.</p>

<p>"But Astarbe fearing that, if Narbal should come before
the king, he might discover the imposture, dispatched this
officer with the utmost expedition, who delivered her commands
in these words: 'It is the pleasure of Astarbe, that you do not
discover the stranger whom you brought hither to the king;
she requires nothing of you but to be silent, and will herself
be answerable for whatever is necessary to your justification;
but let your friend immediately embark with the Cyprians,
that he may no more be seen in the city.' Narbal, who received
this proposal of deliverance with ecstasy, readily promised
to fulfil the conditions, and the officer, well satisfied to
have succeeded in his commission, returned to Astarbe to
make his report.</p>

<p>"Upon this occasion, we could not but admire the divine
goodness, which had so suddenly rewarded our integrity, and
interposed, almost by a miracle, in favor of them that were
ready to have sacrificed every thing to truth.</p>

<p>"We reflected with horror upon a king who had given
himself up to avarice and sensuality. 'He who is thus suspicious
of deceit,' said we, 'deserves to be deceived. He suspects
the good, and puts himself into the hands of the bad. He
alone is ignorant of the fraud by which he is overreached.
Thus, while Pygmalion is made the tool of a shameless woman,

<!-- page 203 -->

the gods render the falsehood of the wicked an instrument for
the preservation of the righteous, to whom it is less dreadful to
perish than to lie.'</p>

<p>"At the very time in which we were making these reflections,
we perceived the wind change. It now blew fair for the
Cyprian fleet, and Narbal cried out: 'The gods declare for
thee, my dear Telemachus, and will complete thy deliverance!
Fly from this cruel, this execrable coast! To follow thee, to
whatever climate&mdash;to follow thee, in life and death&mdash;would be
happiness and honor. But, alas! Fate has connected me with
this wretched country: with my country I am born to suffer,
and perhaps in her ruins I shall perish! But of what moment
is this, if my tongue be still faithful to truth, and my heart
holds fast its integrity? As for thee, my dear Telemachus,
may the gods, who guide thee by their wisdom, reward thee
to the utmost of their bounty by giving and continuing to thee
that virtue which is pure, generous, and exalted! Mayest thou
survive every danger, return in safety to Ithaca, and deliver
Penelope from the presumption of her suitors! May thy eyes
behold, and thy arms embrace, the wise Ulysses; and may he
rejoice in a son that will add new honors to his name! But,
in the midst of thy felicity, suffer, at least, the sorrows of
friendship, the pleasing anguish of virtue, to steal upon thee
for a moment; and remember unhappy Narbal with a sigh,
that shall at once express his misery and thy affection.'</p>

<p>"My heart melted within me as he spoke; and, when he
expected my reply, I threw myself upon his neck and bedewed
it with my tears, but was unable to utter a word: we therefore
embraced in silence and he then conducted me to the vessel.
While we weighed anchor, he stood upon the beach; and
when the vessel was under sail, we looked towards each other
till the objects became confused, and at length totally disappeared."</p>

<hr/>

<h2 class="center" id="tb04">BOOK IV.</h2>

<p class="small">Calypso interrupts Telemachus in his relation, that he may retire to rest.
Mentor privately reproves him for having undertaken the recital of his
adventures; but as he has begun, advises him to proceed. Telemachus
relates that during his voyage from Tyre to Cyprus, he dreamed that
he was protected from Venus and Cupid by Minerva; that he afterwards
imagined he saw Mentor, who exhorted him to fly from the isle
of Cyprus; that when he awaked, the vessel would have perished in a
storm if he had not himself taken the helm, the Cyprians being all intoxicated
with wine; that when he arrived on the island, he saw, with
horror, the most contagious examples of debauchery; but that Hazael,
the Syrian, to whom Mentor had been sold, happening to be at Cyprus
at the same time, brought the two friends together, and took them on
board his vessel that was bound to Crete; that during the voyage, he
had seen Amphitrite drawn in her chariot by sea-horses&mdash;a sight infinitely
entertaining and magnificent.</p>

<p>CALYPSO, who had till this instant sat motionless, and
listening with inexpressible delight to the adventures of Telemachus,
now interrupted him, that he might enjoy some
repose. "It is time," said she, "that, after so many toils, you
should taste the sweets of sleep. In this island you have
nothing to fear; every thing is here subservient to your wishes.
Open your heart, therefore, to joy, and make room for all the
blessings of peace which the gods are preparing for you.
To-morrow, when the rosy<sup id="t_ref061"><a href="#t_en061">61</a></sup> fingers of Aurora shall unlock the
golden doors of the east, and the steeds of Ph&oelig;bus shall
mount up from the deep, diffusing the beams of day,<sup id="t_ref062"><a href="#t_en062">62</a></sup> and

<!-- page 205 -->

driving before them the stars of heaven,<sup id="t_ref063"><a href="#t_en063">63</a></sup> the history of your
misfortunes, my dear Telemachus, shall be resumed. You have
exceeded even your father in wisdom and in courage; nor has
Achilles, the conqueror of Hector, nor Theseus, who returned
from hell, nor even the great Alcides, who delivered the earth
from so many monsters, displayed either fortitude or virtue
equal to yours. May one deep and unbroken slumber render
the night short to you; though, to me, alas! it will be wearisome
and long. With what impatience shall I desire again to
see you, to hear your voice; to urge you to repeat what I have
been told already; and inquire after what I am still to learn.
Go then, my dear Telemachus, with that friend whom the
bounty of the gods has again restored; retire into the grotto
which has been prepared for your repose. May Morpheus
shed his benignest influence upon your eyelids, that are now
heavy with watching, and diffuse a pleasing languor through
your limbs, that are fatigued with labor! May he cause the
most delightful dreams to sport around you, fill your imagination
with gay ideas, and keep far from you whatever might
chase them away too soon!"</p>

<p>The goddess then conducted Telemachus into the separate
grotto, which was not less rural or pleasant than her own. In
one part of it, the lulling murmurs of a fountain invited sleep
to the weary;<sup id="t_ref064"><a href="#t_en064">64</a></sup> and in another, the nymphs had prepared two
beds of the softest moss, and covered them with two large
skins,&mdash;one with that of a lion for Telemachus, and the other
with that of a bear for Mentor.</p>

<p>Mentor, before he resigned his eyes to sleep, spoke thus to
Telemachus: "The pleasure of relating your adventures has
ensnared you; for, by displaying the dangers which you have
surmounted by your courage and your ingenuity, you have
captivated Calypso; and, in proportion as you have inflamed
her passions, you have insured your own captivity.  Can it be

<!-- page 206 -->

hoped that she will suffer him to depart who has displayed
such power to please? You have been betrayed to indiscretion
by your vanity. She promised to relate some stories to you,
and to acquaint you with the adventures and the fate of Ulysses;
but she has found means to say much without giving you
any information, and to draw from you whatever she desired
to know. Such are the arts of the flatterer and the wanton!
When, O Telemachus, will you be wise enough to resist the
impulse of vanity, and know how to suppress incidents that do
you honor, when it is not fit that they should be related?
Others, indeed, admire the wisdom which you possess at an
age in which they think folly might be forgiven; but I can
forgive you nothing: your heart is known only to me, and
there is no other who loves you well enough to tell you your
faults. How much does your father still surpass you in
wisdom!"</p>

<p>"Could I then," answered Telemachus, "have refused an
account of my misfortunes to Calypso?" "No," replied Mentor;
"but you should have gratified her curiosity only by reciting
such circumstances as might have raised her compassion.
You might have told her that, after having long wandered from
place to place, you were first a captive in Sicily, and then a
slave in Egypt. This would have been enough; and all that
was more, served only to render that poison more active which
now rages at her heart,&mdash;a poison from which pray the gods
that thy heart may be defended."</p>

<p>"But what can now be done?" continued Telemachus, in a
calmer tone. "Now," replied Mentor, "the sequel of your
story cannot be suppressed: Calypso knows too much to be
deceived in that which she has yet to learn; and to attempt
it would be only to displease her. Proceed, therefore, to-morrow,
in your account of all that the gods have done for you;
and speak another time with more modesty of such actions of
your own as may be thought to merit praise."</p>

<p>This salutary advice was received by Telemachus with the
same friendship with which it was given by Mentor; and they
immediately lay down to rest.</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>As soon as the first rays of Ph&oelig;bus glanced upon the
mountains, Mentor heard the voice of Calypso calling to her
nymphs in the neighboring wood, and awakened Telemachus.
"It is time," said he, "to vanquish sleep. Let us now return
to Calypso, but put no confidence in her honeyed words; shut
your heart against her, and dread the delicious poison of her
praise. Yesterday she exalted you above the wise Ulysses
your father, and the invincible Achilles; above Theseus, who
filled the earth with his fame, and Hercules, who obtained a
place in the skies. Did you perceive the excess of such adulation,
or did you believe her praises to be just? Calypso
herself laughs in secret at so romantic a falsehood, which she
uttered, only because she believed you to be so vain as to be
gratified by the grossest flattery, and so weak as to be imposed
upon by the most extravagant improbability."</p>

<p>They now approached the place where they were expected
by the goddess. The moment she perceived them, she forced
a smile, and attempted to conceal, under the appearance of
joy, the dread and anxiety which agitated her bosom; for she
foresaw, that, under the direction of Mentor, Telemachus, like
Ulysses, would elude her snares. "Come," said she, "my dear
Telemachus, and relieve me from the impatience of curiosity.
I have dreamed all the night of your departure from Ph&oelig;nicia
to seek new adventures in the isle of Cyprus. Let us not,
therefore, lose another moment; make haste to satisfy me with
knowledge, and put an end to the illusions of conjecture."
They then sat down upon the grass, that was intermingled
with violets, in the shade of a lofty grove.</p>

<p>Calypso could not refrain from looking frequently, with the
most passionate tenderness, at Telemachus; nor perceive, without
indignation, that every glance of her eye was remarked by
Mentor. Nevertheless, all her nymphs silently ranged themselves
in a semicircle, and leaned forward with the utmost eagerness
of attention. The eyes of the whole assembly were
unmovably fixed upon Telemachus.<sup id="t_ref065"><a href="#t_en065">65</a></sup></p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>Looking downward, and blushing with the most graceful
modesty, he thus continued his narrative:</p>

<p>"Our sails had not been long filled with the gentle breath
of a favoring wind,<sup id="t_ref066"><a href="#t_en066">66</a></sup> before the level coast of Ph&oelig;nicia disappeared.
As I was now associated with Cyprians, of whose
manners I was totally ignorant, I determined to remain silent,
that I might the better remark all that passed, and recommend
myself to my companions by the most scrupulous decorum.
But, during my silence, a deep sleep stole insensibly upon me;
the involuntary exercise of all my faculties was suspended; I
sunk into the most luxurious tranquillity, and my heart overflowed
with delight.</p>

<p>"On a sudden I thought the clouds parted, and that I saw
Venus in her chariot drawn by two doves. She appeared in
all that radiance of beauty, that gayety of youth, that smiling
softness, and irresistible grace, which Jupiter himself could
hardly behold with firmness, when first she issued from the foam
of the sea. I thought she descended with astonishing rapidity,
and in a moment reached the spot on which I stood, that
she then, with a smile, laid her hand upon my shoulder, and
pronounced these words: 'Young Greek, thou art now about
to enter into my dominions; thou shalt shortly arrive at that
fortunate island, where every pleasure springs up under my
steps. There thou shalt burn incense upon my altars, and I
will lavish upon thee inexhaustible delight. Let thy heart
therefore indulge the utmost luxuriance of hope; and reject
not the happiness which the most powerful of all the deities
is now willing to bestow.'</p>

<p>"At the same time, I perceived the boy Cupid, fluttering,
on his little wings, around his mother. The lovely softness
and laughing simplicity of childhood appeared in his countenance;
but in his eyes, which sparkled with a piercing brightness,
there was something that I could not behold without
fear. He looked at me with a smile; but it was the malignant
smile of derision and cruelty.  He selected from his

<!-- page 209 -->

golden quiver the keenest of all his arrows, and having bent
his bow, the shaft was just parting from the string, when Minerva
suddenly appeared, and lifted her immortal &aelig;gis before
me. In her aspect there was not that exquisite softness, that
amorous languor, which I had remarked in the countenance
and attitude of Venus. The beauty of Minerva was simple,
chaste, and unaffected; all was easy and natural, yet spirited,
striking, and majestic. The shaft of Cupid, not having sufficient
force to penetrate the shield that intercepted it, fell to
the ground. The god, touched at once with shame and indignation,
withdrew his bow, and betrayed his disappointment
with a sigh. 'Away, presumptuous boy!' said Minerva; 'thou
hast power only over the base, who prefer the sordid pleasures
of sensuality to the sublime enjoyments of wisdom, virtue, and
honor.'</p>

<p>"Love, blushing with restrained anger, flew away without
reply; and Venus again ascending to Olympus, I long traced
her chariot and her doves in a cloud of intermingled azure
and gold; but at length they disappeared. When I turned
my eyes downwards, I perceived that Minerva also had left
me.</p>

<p>"I then fancied myself transported to a delightful garden,
which revived in my mind the descriptions that I had heard of
Elysium. Here I met with Mentor, who accosted me in these
words: 'Fly from this fatal country, this island of contagion,
where every breeze is tainted with sensuality, where the most
heroic virtue has cause for fear, and safety can be obtained only
by flight!' The moment I saw Mentor, I attempted to throw
my arms about him in an ecstasy of joy; but I strove in vain
to lift my feet from the ground, my knees failed under me, and
my arms closed over an empty shade, which eluded their
grasp. The effort awoke me, and I perceived that this mysterious
dream was a divine admonition. A more animated resolution
against pleasure, and greater diffidence of my own virtue,
concurred to make me detest the effeminate and voluptuous
manners of the Cyprians. But I was most affected by the
apprehension that Mentor was dead, and that, having passed

<!-- page 210 -->

the waters of the Styx, he was fixed forever in the blissful
dwellings of the just.</p>

<p>"I mused upon this imaginary loss till I burst into tears.
They asked me why I wept. I replied, that it might easily be
guessed why an unhappy fugitive, who despaired of returning
to his country, should weep. In the mean time, however, all
the Cyprians that were on board gave themselves up to the
most extravagant merriment. The rowers, to whom a mere
suspension of labor was a luxury, fell asleep upon their oars;
but the pilot, who had quitted the helm, and crowned himself
with flowers, held in his hand an enormous bowl, which he had
almost emptied of wine; and with the rest of the crew, who
were equally intoxicated, sang such songs to the praise of Venus
and Cupid, as no man who has a reverence for virtue can hear
without horror.</p>

<p>"While they were thus thoughtless of danger, a sudden
tempest began to trouble the ocean and obscure the sky. The
winds, as in the wild ardor of unexpected freedom, were heard
bellowing among the sails; and the dark waves dashed against
the sides of the vessel, which groaned under the strokes. Now
we floated on the ridge of a stupendous billow; now the sea
seemed to glide from under us, and leave us buried in the
abyss. We perceived also some rocks near us, and heard the
waves breaking against them with a dreadful noise. I had
often heard Mentor say, that the effeminate and voluptuous are
never brave; and I now found by experience that it was true.
All the Cyprians, whose jollity had been so extravagant and
tumultuous, now sank under a sense of their danger, and wept
like women. I heard nothing but the screams of terror, and
the wailings of hopeless distress. Some lamented the loss of
pleasures that were never to return, and some made idle vows
of sacrifice to the gods, if they reached their port in safety.
None had presence of mind, either to undertake or direct the
navigation of the vessel. In this situation I thought it my
duty to save the lives of others, by saving my own. I took
the helm into my own hand, for the pilot was so intoxicated as
to be wholly insensible of the danger of the vessel.  I encouraged

<!-- page 211 -->

the affrighted mariners, and ordered the sails to be taken
in. The men rowed vigorously, and we soon found ourselves
clear of the rocks, among which we had beheld all the horrors
of death at so near a view.</p>

<p>"This event had the appearance of a dream to the mariners,
who were indebted to me for their lives; and they looked upon
me with astonishment. We arrived at the isle of Cyprus in
that month of the Spring which is consecrated to Venus. The
Cyprians believe this season to be under the influence of the
goddess, because all nature then appears animated with new
vigor, and pleasure seems to spring up spontaneously with the
flowers of the field.<sup id="t_ref067"><a href="#t_en067">67</a></sup></p>

<p>"As soon as I went on shore, I perceived a certain softness
in the air, which, though it rendered the body indolent and inactive,
yet brought on a disposition to gayety and wantonness.
I observed that the inhabitants were so averse to labor, that the
country, though extremely fertile and pleasant, was almost
wholly uncultivated. I met, in every street, crowds of women,
loosely dressed, singing the praises of Venus, and going to
dedicate themselves to the service of her temple. Beauty and
pleasure sparkled in their countenances, but their beauty was
tainted by affectation. The modest simplicity, from which
female charms principally derive their power, was wanting.
The dissolute air, the studied look, the flaunting dress, and the
lascivious gait, the expressive glances that seemed to wander
in search after those of the men, the visible emulation who
should kindle the most ardent passion, and whatever else I
discovered in these women, moved only my contempt and
aversion; and I was disgusted by all that they did with a
desire to please.</p>

<p>"I was conducted to a temple of the goddess, of which there

<!-- page 212 -->

are several in the island; for she is worshipped at Cythera,
Idalia, and Paphos. That which I visited was at Cythera.
The structure, which is of marble, is a complete peristyle;
and the columns are so large and lofty, that its appearance is
extremely majestic: on each front, over the architrave and
frieze, are large pediments, on which the most entertaining
adventures of the goddess are represented in bas-relief. There
is a perpetual crowd of people with offerings at the gate.</p>

<p>"Within the limits of the consecrated ground, no victim is
ever slain; the fat of bulls and heifers is never burnt, as at
other temples; nor are the rites of pleasure profaned with
their blood. The beasts that are here offered, are only presented
before the altar, nor are any accepted, but those that are
young, white, and without blemish; they are dressed with
purple fillets, embroidered with gold, and their horns are decorated
with gilding and flowers: after they have been presented,
they are led to a proper place at a considerable distance, and
killed for the banquet of the priests.</p>

<p>"Perfumed liquors are also offered, and wines sweeter
than nectar. The habit of the priests is a long white robe,
fringed with gold at the bottom, and bound around them with
a golden girdle. The richest aromatics of the East burn night
and day upon the altars, and the smoke rises in a cloud of
fragrance to the skies. All the columns of the temple are
adorned with festoons; all the sacrificial vessels are of gold;
the whole building is surrounded by a consecrated grove of
odoriferous myrtle. None are permitted to present the victims
to the priest, or to kindle the hallowed fire, but boys and girls
of consummate beauty. But this temple, however magnificent,
was rendered infamous by the dissolute manners of the
votaries.</p>

<p>"What I saw in this place struck me at first with horror;
but at length, by insensible degrees, it became familiar. I was
to longer alarmed at the appearance of vice; the manners of
the company had a kind of contagious influence upon me: nay
innocence was universally derided; and my modesty and reserve
became the sport of impudence and buffoonery.  Every

<!-- page 213 -->

art was practised to excite my passions, to ensnare me by
temptation, to kindle the love of pleasure in my breast. I
perceived that I was every day less capable of resistance; the
influence of education was surmounted; my virtuous resolutions
melted away. I could no longer struggle against the
evils that pressed upon me on every side; and from dreading
vice, I came at length to be ashamed of virtue. I was like a
man who attempts to swim a deep and rapid river; his first
efforts are vigorous, and he makes way against the stream;
but, if the shores are steep, and he cannot rest himself upon
the bank, he grows weary by degrees; his strength is exhausted;
his limbs become stiff with fatigue; and he is carried
away by the torrent.</p>

<p>"Thus my eyes began to grow dim to the deformity of vice,
and my heart shrank from the toil of virtue. I could no
longer call in the power of reason to my assistance, nor remember
the example of my father with emulation. The
dream, in which I had seen Mentor in the fields of Elysium,
repressed the last feeble effort of my virtue. A pleasing
languor stole insensibly upon me; I felt the seductive poison
glide from vein to vein, and diffuse itself through every limb,
with a secret satisfaction. Yet, by sudden starts, I deplored
my captivity with sighs and tears; sometimes I pined with regret,
and sometimes raved with indignation. 'How wretched
a period of life,' said I, 'is youth! Wherefore did the gods,
who cruelly sport with the calamities of men, ordain them to
pass through that state which is divided between the sports of
folly and the agonies of desire? Why is not my head already
hoary, and why do not my steps falter on the brink of the
grave? Why am I not already like Laertes, whose son is my
father? Death itself would be sweeter than the shameful
weakness of which I am now conscious!'</p>

<p>But these exclamations had no sooner burst from me, than
my anguish would abate; my conscience, lulled by the opiates
of sensuality, would again cease to be susceptible of shame;
till some sudden thought would rouse me once more to sensibility,
and sting me with yet keener remorse.  In this state of

<!-- page 214 -->

perplexity and anguish, I frequently wandered about in the
consecrated grove, like a hart wounded by the hunters: the
fleet hart reaches the distant forest in a moment, but he carries
the tormenting shaft in his side:<sup id="t_ref068"><a href="#t_en068">68</a></sup> thus I vainly attempted
to escape from myself; but nothing could alleviate the anguish
of my breast.</p>

<p>"I was one day in this situation, when, at some distance before
me, in the most gloomy part of the grove, I discovered
Mentor; but upon a nearer approach, his countenance appeared
so pale, and expressed such a mixture of grief and
austerity, that I felt no joy in his presence. 'Can it be thou,'
I exclaimed, 'my dearest friend, my only hope! Can it be
thou thyself in very deed; or do I thus gaze upon a fleeting
illusion? Is it Mentor? or is it the spirit of Mentor, that is
still touched with my misfortunes? Art not thou numbered
among the happy spirits, who rejoice in the fruition of their
own virtue, to which the gods have superadded the pure and
everlasting pleasures of Elysium? Speak Mentor, dost thou
yet live? Am I again happy in thy counsel, or art thou only
the manes of my friend?' As I pronounced these words, I
ran towards him breathless and transported. He calmly waited
for me, without advancing a single step; but the gods only
know with what joy I perceived that he filled my grasp. 'No,
it is not an empty shade; I hold him fast; I embrace my
dear Mentor!' Thus I expressed the tumult of my mind in
broken exclamations; till, bursting into tears, I hung upon his
neck without power to speak. He continued to look steadfastly
at me with a mixture of grief, tenderness, and compassion,</p>

<p>" 'Alas!' said I, 'whence art thou come? What dangers
have surrounded me in thy absence! and what should I now
have done without thee?' Mentor, not regarding my questions,
cried out in a voice that shook me with terror: 'Fly!

<!-- page 215 -->

delay not a moment to fly. The very fruits of this soil are
poison; the air is pestilential; the inhabitants themselves are
contagious, and speak only to infuse the most deadly venom.
Sordid and infamous sensuality, the most dreadful evil that
issued from the box of Pandora, corrupts every heart, and eradicates
every virtue. Fly! wherefore dost thou linger? Fly!
cast not one look behind thee; nor let even thy thoughts return
to this accursed island for a moment.'</p>

<p>"While he yet spoke, I perceived, as it were, a thick cloud
vanish from before me, and my eyes were once more illuminated
with the rays of pure light. My heart was elated with a
peaceful yet vigorous joy, very different from the dissolute and
tumultuous pleasures of desire: one is the joy of phrensy and
confusion, a perpetual transition from raging passion to the
keenest remorse; the other is the calm and equal felicity of
reason, which, like divine beatitude, can neither satiate nor be
exhausted. It filled all my breast, and overflowed in tears;
nor have I found on earth any higher enjoyment than thus to
weep. 'Happy,' said I, 'are those by whom virtue vouchsafes
to be seen in all her beauty! Thus to behold her is to love her;
and to love her is to be happy.'</p>

<p>"But my attention was recalled to Mentor. 'I must leave
you,' said he; 'nor can my stay be protracted a moment.'
'Whither dost thou go, then?' I responded. 'To what deserts
will I not follow thee! Think not to depart without me, for I
will rather die at thy feet.' Immediately I caught hold of
him, and held him with all my force. 'It is in vain,' said he,
'that thy zeal attempts to detain me. I was sold by Metophis
to the Arabs or Ethiopians.<sup id="t_ref069"><a href="#t_en069">69</a></sup> They, having gone on a trading
journey to Damascus<sup id="t_ref070"><a href="#t_en070">70</a></sup> in Syria, determined to part with me,
imagining that they could sell me for a large sum to one
Hazael, a man who was seeking after a Grecian slave, to
acquaint him with the manners of the country, and instruct
him in the sciences.</p>

<!-- page 216 -->

<p>" 'I was purchased by Hazael at a very high price. The
knowledge which he soon acquired from me of the Grecian
policy, inclined him to go into Crete,<sup id="t_ref071"><a href="#t_en071">71</a></sup> to study the wise laws of
Minos. The voyage was immediately undertaken; but we were
driven, by contrary winds, to Cyprus; and he has taken this
opportunity to make his offering at the temple. I see him
now coming out; a favorable wind already fills our sails, and
calls us on board. Farewell, my dear Telemachus; a slave
who fears the gods cannot dispense with his obligation to
attend his master. The gods have made me the property of
another; and they know that if I had any right in myself, I
would transfer it to you alone. Farewell! remember the
achievements of Ulysses and the tears of Penelope; remember,
also, that the gods are just. Ye powers, who are the protectors
of the innocent, in what a country am I compelled to
leave Telemachus!'</p>

<p>" 'No,' said I, 'my dear Mentor, here thou canst not leave
me; for I will rather perish than suffer thee to depart without
me. But has thy Syrian master no compassion? Will he
tear thee, by violence, from my arms? He must either take
away my life, or suffer me to follow thee. Thou hast thyself
exhorted me to fly; why, then, am I forbidden to fly with
thee? I will speak myself to Hazael; perhaps he may regard
my youth and my distress with pity: he, who is so enamored
of wisdom as to seek her in distant countries, cannot surely
have a savage and insensible heart. I will throw myself at his
feet; I will embrace his knees; I will not suffer him to depart,
till he has consented that I may follow thee. My dear Mentor,
I will wear the chains of slavery with thee! I will offer
myself to Hazael; and if he rejects me, my lot is thrown; and I
will seek reception, where I know I shall find it, in the grave.'</p>

<p>"Just as I had pronounced these words, Mentor was called
by Hazael, before whom I immediately fell prostrate on the
ground. Hazael, who was astonished to see a stranger in that
posture, asked what I would request.  'I request my life,' said

<!-- page 217 -->

I; 'for, if I am not permitted to follow Mentor, who is your
servant, I must die. I am the son of the great Ulysses, who
surpassed in wisdom all the Grecian princes by whom Troy, a
city famous throughout all Asia, was overturned. But think
not that I speak of my birth to exact a tribute to my vanity;
I mean only to strengthen the claim of misfortune to thy pity.
I have wandered from coast to coast, in search of my father,
with this man, whom friendship has made a father to me.
Fortune has at length completed my calamity, by taking him
from me: he is now thy slave; let me, therefore, be thy slave
also. If thou art, indeed, a lover of justice, and art going to
Crete to acquaint thyself with the laws of Minos, thou wilt not
resist the importunity of my distress. Thou seest the son of
a mighty prince reduced to sue for slavery, as the only possible
condition of comfort. There was a time when I preferred
death to servitude in Sicily; but the evils which I there suffered
were but the first essays of the rage of fortune. I now
tremble, lest I should not be admitted into that state, which
then I would have died to shun. May the gods look down on
my misfortunes, and may Hazael remember Minos, whose
wisdom he admires, and whose judgment shall, in the realms
of Pluto be passed upon us both.'</p>

<p>"Hazael, looking upon me with great complaisance and humanity,
gave me his hand and raised me from the ground.
'I am not ignorant,' said he, 'of the wisdom and virtue of
Ulysses; I have been often told by Mentor what glory he
acquired among the Greeks; and fame has made his name
familiar to all the nations of the East. Follow me, son of
Ulysses; I will be your father, till you find him from whom
you have derived your being. If I had no sense of the glory
of Ulysses, or of his misfortunes, or of yours, the friendship
which I bear to Mentor would alone induce me to take care of
you. I bought him indeed as a slave, but he is now mine by
a nobler connection; for the money that he cost me procured
me the dearest and most valuable of all my friends. In him
I have found that wisdom which I sought; to him I owe all
the love of virtue that I have acquired. This moment, therefore,

<!-- page 218 -->

I restore his freedom, and continue thine: I renounce
your service, and require only your esteem.'</p>

<p>"The most piercing anguish was now changed in a moment
to unutterable joy. I perceived myself delivered from total
ruin; I was approaching my country; I was favored with assistance
that might enable me to reach it; I had the consolation
of being near a person whose love for me had no foundation
but the love of virtue; and whatever else could contribute
to my felicity was comprehended in my meeting with
Mentor to part no more.</p>

<p>"Hazael proceeded directly to the port, followed by Mentor
and myself, and we all embarked together. The peaceful
waves were divided by our oars; a gentle breeze, which
sported in our sails, seemed, as it were, to animate our bark,
and impel it forward with an easy motion. Cyprus quickly
disappeared. Hazael, who was impatient to know my sentiments,
asked me what I thought of the manners of that
island. I told him ingenuously the dangers to which my
youth had been exposed, and the conflict which had agitated
my bosom. He was touched at my horror of vice; and cried
out: 'Venus, I acknowledge thy power, and that of thy son;
I have burnt incense upon thy altars; but forgive me if I detest
that infamous effeminacy which prevails in thy dominions,
and the brutal sensuality which is practised at thy feasts.'</p>

<p>"He then discoursed with Mentor of that first Power which
created the heaven and the earth; of that infinite and immutable
intelligence which communicates itself to all, but is not
divided; of that sovereign and universal truth which illuminates
intellectual nature, as the sun enlightens the material
world. 'He who has never received this pure emanation of
divinity,' said Hazael, 'is as blind as those who are born without
sight; he passes through life in darkness, like that which
involves the polar regions, where the night is protracted to half
the year;<sup id="t_ref072"><a href="#t_en072">72</a></sup> he believes himself to be wise, and is a fool; he

<!-- page 219 -->

imagines that his eye comprehends every object, and he sees
nothing, or, at most, he perceives only some fleeting illusions
by a glimmering and deceitful light, some unsubstantial vapors,
that are every moment changing their color and shape, and at
length fade into total obscurity. Such is the state of every
man who is captivated by the pleasures of sense, and allured
by the phantoms of imagination. Indeed, none are worthy the
name of men but those who walk by the dictates of eternal
reason, who love and follow the guiding ray that is vouchsafed
from above. It is by this reason that we are inspired
when our thoughts are good; and by it we are reproved when
they are evil. From it we derive intelligence and life. It is
an ocean of light: our minds are but small streams that issue
from it and are quickly reabsorbed in the deep from which
they flowed.'</p>

<p>"This discourse, indeed, I did not perfectly comprehend;
yet I perceived something in it that was elevated and refined;
and my heart caught fire at the beams of truth which glanced
within the verge of my understanding. They proceeded to
talk of the origin of the gods, of heroes, of poets, of the
golden age, and of the universal deluge; of the river of oblivion,
in which the souls of the dead are plunged; of the perpetual
punishment that is inflicted upon the wicked in the
gloomy gulf of Tartarus; and of that happy tranquillity which
is enjoyed in the fields of Elysium by the spirits of the just,
who exult in the assurance that it shall last forever.</p>

<p>"While Hazael and Mentor were discoursing upon these
topics, we perceived several dolphins approaching, whose scales
were varied with azure and gold. Their sport swelled the sea
into waves, and covered it with foam. These were followed
by tritons, who with their spiral shells emulated the music of
the trumpet. In the midst of them appeared the chariot of
Amphitrite, drawn by sea-horses whiter than snow, which, dividing
the waves as they passed, left behind them long furrows
in the deep. Fire sparkled in their eyes, and from their nostrils
issued clouds of smoke. The chariot of the goddess was
a shell, whiter and brighter than ivory, of a wonderful figure;

<!-- page 220 -->

and it was mounted upon wheels of gold. It seemed almost
to fly over the level surface of the water. A great number of
young nymphs swam in a crowd after the chariot; their hair,
which was decorated with flowers, flowed loosely behind them,
and wantoned in the breeze. The goddess held in one hand
a sceptre of gold, with which she awed the waves to obedience;
and, with the other, she held the little god Palemon,
her son, whom she suckled upon her lap. Such sweetness
and majesty were expressed in her countenance, that the rebellious
winds dispersed at her appearance, and gloomy tempests
howled only at a distance. Tritons guided the horses
with golden reins. A large purple sail waved above, which
was but half distended by a multitude of little Zephyrs, who
labored to swell it with their breath. In the mid air appeared
&AElig;olus, busy, restless, and vehement. His wrinkled and morose
countenance, his threatening voice, his shaggy brows, which
hung down to his beard, and the sullen austerity that gleamed
in his eyes, awed the hurricanes of the north to silence, and
drove back the clouds. Whales of an enormous size, and all
the monsters of the deep, that caused the sea to ebb and flow
with their nostrils, rushed from their secret recesses, to gaze
upon the goddess."<sup id="t_ref073"><a href="#t_en073">73</a></sup></p>

<p class="small">Telemachus relates, that when he arrived at Crete, he learnt that Idomeneus,
the king of that island, had, in consequence of a rash vow, sacrificed
his only son; that the Cretans, to revenge the murder, had driven
him out of the country; that after long uncertainty they were then
assembled to elect a new sovereign; that he was admitted into the assembly;
that he obtained the prize in various exercises; having also
resolved the questions that had been recorded by Minos in the book
of his laws, the sages, who were judges of the contest, and all the
people, seeing his wisdom, would have made him king; that he refused
the royalty of Crete to return to Ithaca; that he proposed Mentor, but
that Mentor also refused to be king; that the Cretans then pressing
Mentor to appoint a king for them, he relates to them what he heard of
the virtues of Aristodemus, whom they immediately proclaimed; that
Mentor and Telemachus having embarked for Italy, Neptune, to gratify
the resentment of Venus, shipwrecked them on the island of Calypso,
where the goddess received them with hospitality and kindness.</p>

<p>"AFTER the goddess and her train disappeared, we began to
discover the mountains of Crete, although we could yet
scarcely distinguish them from the clouds of heaven and the
waves of the sea. But it was not long before the summit of
Mount Ida<sup id="t_ref074"><a href="#t_en074">74</a></sup> was seen, towering above the neighboring mountains,
as the branching horns<sup id="t_ref075"><a href="#t_en075">75</a></sup> of a stag are distinguished
among the young fawns that surround him. By degrees we
discovered more distinctly the coast of the island, which had
the appearance of an amphitheatre. In Crete, the soil appeared
to us as fertile and enriched with every kind of fruit by the
labor of its inhabitants, as, in Cyprus, it had appeared wild and
uncultivated.</p>

<p>"We perceived innumerable villages that were well built,
towns that were little inferior to cities, and cities that were in

<!-- page 222 -->

the highest degree magnificent. There was no field on which
the husbandman had not impressed the characters of diligence
and labor; the plough was everywhere to be traced; and there
was scarcely a bramble or a weed to be found in the island.
We remarked, with pleasure, the deep valleys in which numerous
herds of cattle were grazing among many rivulets that
enriched the soil; the sheep that were feeding on the declivity
of the hills; the spacious plains that were covered with the
golden bounty of Ceres; and the mountains that were adorned
with the lively verdure of the vine, and with clusters of grapes
already tinged with blue, and promising the blessing of Bacchus,
which soothes anxiety to peace and animates weariness
to new vigor.</p>

<p>"Mentor told us that he had before been in Crete, and acquainted
us with whatever he knew of the country. 'This
island,' said he, 'which is admired by all foreigners, and famous
for its hundred cities,<sup id="t_ref076"><a href="#t_en076">76</a></sup> produces all the necessaries of life in
great plenty for its inhabitants, although they are almost innumerable;
for the earth is always profusely bountiful to those
who cultivate it, and its treasures are inexhaustible. The
greater the number of inhabitants in any country, the greater
plenty they enjoy, if they are not idle; nor have they any
cause to be jealous of each other. The earth, like a good
mother, multiplies her gifts in proportion to the number of her
children, who merit her bounty by their labor. The ambition
and the avarice of mankind are the only source of their calamities;
every individual wishes to possess the portion of all, and
becomes wretched by the desire of superfluities. If men would
be content with the simplicity of nature, and wish only to
satisfy their real necessities, plenty, cheerfulness, domestic
concord, and public tranquillity would be uninterrupted and
universal.</p>

" 'A deep knowledge of these important truths was the

<!-- page 223 -->

glory of Minos, the wisest of legislators and the best of kings.
All the wonders of this island are the effects of his laws. The
education which he prescribed for children renders the body
healthy and robust, and forms an early habit of frugality and
labor. That every species and degree of voluptuousness will
debilitate both the body and the mind, is an established maxim;
and no pleasure is proposed as the object of desire, but that of
becoming invincible by heroic virtue and distinguished by
superior glory. Courage is not considered as the contempt of
death only in the field of battle, but also as the contempt of
superfluous wealth and shameful pleasure. And three vices
are punished in Crete, which in every other country are suffered
with impunity&mdash;ingratitude, dissimulation, and avarice.</p>

<p>" 'It might, perhaps, be expected that there should be some
law against luxury and pomp; but at Crete luxury and pomp
are not known. Every man labors, and no man thinks of becoming
rich: labor is thought to be sufficiently recompensed
by a life of quiet and regularity, in which all that the wants of
nature have made necessary is enjoyed in plenty and in peace.
No splendid palace, no costly furniture, no magnificent apparel,
no voluptuous festivity, is permitted. The clothing of the inhabitants
is, indeed, made of the finest wool, and dyed of the
most beautiful color, but is perfectly plain, and without embroidery.
Their meals, at which they drink little wine, are
extremely temperate, consisting chiefly of bread, such fruits as
the season produces, and milk. If they ever taste animal food,
it is in a small quantity, plainly dressed, and of the coarsest
kind; for they always reserve the finest cattle for labor, that
agriculture may flourish. The houses are neat, convenient,
and pleasant, but without ornament. Architecture is, indeed,
well known among them, in its utmost elegance and magnificence,
but the practice of this art is reserved for the temples of
the gods, and it is thought presumptuous in a mortal to have
dwelling like theirs. The wealth of the Cretans consists in
health, vigor, courage, domestic quiet and concord, public
liberty, plenty of all that is necessary, contempt of all that is
superfluous, habits of industry, abhorrence of idleness, emulation

<!-- page 224 -->

in virtue, submission to the laws, and reverence of the
gods.'</p>

"I inquired in what the authority of the king consisted; and
Mentor answered: 'His authority over the subject is absolute,
but the authority of the law is absolute over him. His power
to do good is unlimited, but he is restrained from doing evil.
The laws have put the people into his hands as the most valuable
deposit, upon condition that he shall treat them as his
children. It is the intent of the law that the wisdom and
equity of one man shall be the happiness of many, and not that
the wretchedness and slavery of many should gratify the pride
and luxury of one. The king ought to possess nothing more
than the subject, except what is necessary to alleviate the
fatigue of his station, and impress upon the minds of the people
a reverence of that authority by which the laws are executed.
Moreover, the king should indulge himself less, as well in ease
as in pleasure, and should be less disposed to the pomp and
the pride of life than any other man; he ought not to be distinguished
from the rest of mankind by the greatness of his
wealth, or the variety of his enjoyments, but by superior wisdom,
more heroic virtue, and more splendid glory. Abroad
he ought to be the defender of his country, by commanding
her armies; and at home, the judge of his people, distributing
justice among them, improving their morals, and increasing
their felicity. It is not for himself that the gods have intrusted
him with royalty: he is exalted above individuals, only that he
may be the servant of the people; to the public he owes all
his time, all his attention, and all his love; he deserves dignity
only in proportion as he gives up private enjoyments for the
public good.</p>

<p>" 'Minos directed that his children should not succeed to his
throne, but upon condition that they should govern by these
maxims. He loved his people yet more than his family; and
by this wise institution he insured power and happiness to his
kingdom. Thus did Minos, the peaceful legislator, eclipse the
glory of mighty conquerors, who sacrificed nations to their own
vanity, and imagined they were great; and his justice has

<!-- page 225 -->

placed him on a more awful tribunal in the world of spirits,
where he distributes rewards and punishments as the supreme
judge of the dead.'</p>

<p>"While Mentor was thus discoursing, we reached the island.
We there saw the celebrated labyrinth which had been built
by D&aelig;dalus in imitation of that of much larger extent which we
had seen in Egypt. While we were contemplating this curious
edifice, we perceived all the coast covered with a multitude
of people, who gathered in a crowd at a place not far distant
from the sea. We inquired the cause of this commotion, and
our curiosity was immediately gratified by a Cretan, whose
name was Nausicrates.</p>

<p>" 'Idomeneus,' said he, 'the son of Deucalion, and grandson
of Minos, accompanied the other princes of Greece in their
expedition against Troy. After the destruction of that city,
he set sail for Crete, but was overtaken by so violent a tempest,
that the pilot, and all others on board the vessel, who
were skilled in navigation, believed shipwreck to be inevitable.
Death was present to every imagination; every one thought
he saw the abyss open to swallow him up; and every one deplored
the misfortune, which did not leave him the mournful
hope of that imperfect rest to which the spirits of the dead
are admitted beyond the waters of the Styx, after funeral rites
have been paid to the body. Idomeneus, lifting up his hands
and his eyes to heaven, and invoking Neptune, cried out: 'O
mighty Deity, to whom belong the dominions of the deep,
vouchsafe to hear me in this uttermost distress! If thou wilt
protect me from the fury of the waves, and restore me in
safety to my country, I will offer up to thee the first living object
that I see on my return.'</p>

<p>" 'In the mean time, his son hasted to meet him with all
the ardor of filial affection, and pleased himself with the
thought of receiving the first embrace. Unhappy youth! He
knew not that to hasten to his father was to rush upon destruction.
Idomeneus, escaping the tempest, arrived at his
port, and returned thanks to Neptune for having heard his
vow; but he was soon sensible of the fatal effects it would

<!-- page 226 -->

produce. A certain presage of misfortune made him repent
his indiscretion with the utmost anguish of mind; he dreaded
his arrival among his people, and thought with horror of meeting
those who were most dear to him. But Nemesis, a cruel
and inexorable goddess, who is ever vigilant to punish mankind,
and rejoices to humble the mighty and the proud, impelled
him forward with a fatal and invisible hand. He proceeded
from the vessel to the shore; but he had scarcely ventured to
lift up his eyes, when he beheld his son. He started back,
pale and trembling. He turned his eyes on every side to find
another victim to whom he was less tenderly allied, but it was
too late! His son sprang to him, and threw his arms around
his neck; but perceived, with astonishment, that instead of returning
his caresses he stood motionless, and at length burst
into tears.</p>

<p>" 'O my father,' said he, 'what is the cause of this sorrow?
After so long an absence, art thou grieved to return to thy
people, and restore happiness to thy son? In what, alas! have
I offended? Thy eyes are still turned from me, as if they
loathed or dreaded to behold me.' The father, overwhelmed
with grief, was not yet able to reply. At length, heavily sighing,
he cried out: 'O Neptune, what have I promised thee?
On what condition hast thou preserved me from shipwreck?
Oh, leave me again to the billows and the rocks! Let me
be dashed to pieces, and swallowed up in the deep; but preserve
my son. Cruel and unrelenting god! let my blood be
accepted as a recompense for his!' Speaking thus, he drew
his sword, and attempted to plunge it in his bosom; but those
who stood near him held back his hand.</p>

<p>" 'Sophronimus, a hoary prophet, who had long interpreted
the will of the gods, assured him that Neptune might be satisfied
without the death of his son. 'Your vow,' said he, 'was
rash; the gods are not honored, but offended by cruelty. Do
not, then, add one enormity to another, and violate the laws
of nature to accomplish that vow which it was a crime to make.
Select a hundred bulls, whiter than snow; decorate the altar
of Neptune with flowers; let these victims be thy blameless

<!-- page 227 -->

offering, and let a cloud of grateful incense ascend in honor of
the god.'</p>

<p>" 'Idomeneus heard this address in an attitude of desperation,
and without reply; his eyes sparkled with fury, his
visage became ghastly, his color changed every moment, and
his whole body shook with the agony of his mind. His son
was touched with his distress; and, having no wish but to
relieve it, said: 'My father, here I am. Delay not to appease
the god to whom thou hast vowed, nor bring down his vengeance
upon thy head. Since thy life can be redeemed with
mine, I will die content. Strike, then, O my father, and fear
not that, at the approach of death, I shall show a weakness
that is unworthy of thy son!'</p>

<p>" 'At this moment, Idomeneus, starting from his posture with
the sudden violence of phrensy, as if roused by the scourge of
the infernal furies, surprised the vigilance of those who had
their eyes upon him, and plunged his sword in the bosom of
his son.<sup id="t_ref077"><a href="#t_en077">77</a></sup> He drew it hastily back; and, while it was yet
warm, made an effort to sheath it a second time in his own
breast; but in this he was again prevented.</p>

<p>" 'The youth, who immediately fell, lay weltering in his blood:
his eyes were suffused with the shades of death; he attempted
to open them; but, not being able to bear the light,<sup id="t_ref078"><a href="#t_en078">78</a></sup> they
were immediately closed in everlasting darkness. As a lily of
the field, when its root is cut away by the ploughshare, being no
longer supported by the stalk, languishes upon the ground;
and, though it does not immediately lose all the lustre of its
beauty, yet is no more nourished by the earth, its life being
extinguished,<sup id="t_ref079"><a href="#t_en079">79</a></sup> so fell the son of Idomeneus, cut down like

<!-- page 228 -->

a flower, by an untimely stroke, in the first bloom of his
youth.</p>

<p>" 'The father, stupefied by excess of grief, knew neither
where he was, nor what he had done, nor what he ought to do,
but walked with faltering steps towards the city, and inquired
eagerly for his child.</p>

<p>" 'In the mean time the people, who were moved with compassion
for the youth, and with horror at the cruelty of the
father, cried out, that the justice of the gods had given him
up to the Furies. Rage supplied them with weapons; one
snatched a stick, another a stone,<sup id="t_ref080"><a href="#t_en080">80</a></sup> and discord infused rancor
and malignity into every bosom. The Cretans, however wise,
were at this time exasperated to folly, and renounced their allegiance
to their king. His friends, therefore, as they could not
otherwise preserve him from popular fury, conducted him back
to the fleet, where they went on board with him, and once
more committed themselves to the mercy of the waves. Idomeneus,
as soon as he recovered from his phrensy, thanked them
for having forced him from a country which he had stained
with the blood of his son; and which, therefore, he could not
bear to inhabit. The winds wafted them to the coast of Hesperia;
and they are now forming a new State in the country of
the Salentines.<sup id="t_ref081"><a href="#t_en081">81</a></sup></p>

<p>" 'The Cretans, having thus lost their king, have resolved to
elect such a person in his stead as shall administer the established

<!-- page 229 -->

laws in their utmost purity. For this purpose, the principal
inhabitants of every city have been summoned hither.
The sacrifices, which are the first solemnities of the election,
are already begun; the most celebrated sages of all the neighboring
countries are assembled to propose questions to the candidates,
as a trial of their sagacity. Preparations are made for
public games, to determine their courage, strength, and activity.
The Cretans are resolved, that, as their kingdom is the prize,
they will bestow it upon him only who shall be adjudged
superior to all others both in body and in mind. To render the
victory more difficult, by increasing the number of competitors,
all foreigners are invited to the contest.'</p>

<p>"Nausicrates, after having related these astonishing events,
pressed us to enter the lists. 'Make haste,' said he, 'O
strangers, to our assembly, and engage, among others, in the
contest; for if the gods decree the victory to either of you, he
shall be the sovereign of Crete!' He then turned hastily from
us; and we followed him, not with any desire of victory, but
only that we might gratify our curiosity, by being present at
so uncommon and important a transaction.</p>

<p>"We came to a kind of circus of vast extent, in the middle
of a thick forest; within the circus<sup id="t_ref082"><a href="#t_en082">82</a></sup> was an area prepared for
the combatants, surrounded by a circular bank of fresh turf,
on which were seated an innumerable multitude of spectators.
We were received with the utmost civility; for the Cretans excel
all other people in a liberal and religious performance of the
duties of hospitality. They not only caused us to be seated,
but invited us to engage in the exercises. Mentor declined it on
account of his age; and Hazael, on account of his feeble health.</p>

<p>"My youth and vigor left me no excuse; however, I glanced
my eye upon Mentor, to discover his sentiments; and I perceived
that he wished I should engage. I therefore accepted
the offer that had been made me, and, throwing off my apparel,

<!-- page 230 -->

my limbs were anointed with oil,<sup id="t_ref083"><a href="#t_en083">83</a></sup> and I placed myself among
the other combatants. A rumor immediately passed through
the whole multitude that the new candidate for the kingdom
was the son of Ulysses; for several of the Cretans, who had
been at Ithaca when I was a child, remembered my face.</p>

<p>"The first exercise was wrestling. A Rhodian, who appeared
to be about thirty-five years of age, threw all that ventured to
encounter him. He was still in his full vigor; his arms were
nervous and brawny; his muscles were discovered at every
motion; he was not less supple than strong. There was now
no competitor remaining but myself; and, as he thought no
honor was to be gained by overcoming so feeble an opponent,
he indulged the compassion which he felt for my youth, and
would have retired; but I pressed forward, and presented myself
before him. We immediately seized each other, and
grappled till both were out of breath. We stood shoulder to
shoulder and foot to foot; every nerve was strained, our arms
were entwined, like serpents, in each other, and each of us
endeavored to lift his antagonist from the ground.<sup id="t_ref084"><a href="#t_en084">84</a></sup> He
attempted to throw me, sometimes by surprise, and sometimes
by mere strength, sometimes on one side, and sometimes on
the other. While he was thus practising all his skill and force
upon me, I threw myself forward, by a sudden effort, with such
violence that, the muscles of his back giving way, he fell to the
ground and drew me upon him. All his efforts to get me
under were ineffectual; I held him immovable under me, till
the multitude shouted, 'Victory to the son of Ulysses!' and
then I assisted him to rise, and he retired in confusion.</p>

<p>"The combat of the cestus was more difficult. The son of
a wealthy citizen of Samos had acquired such reputation in
this exercise, that the rest of the candidates yielded to him

<!-- page 231 -->

without a contest; and the hope of victory animated no bosom
but mine. In the first onset I received such blows on the
head and breast, that blood gushed from my mouth and
nostrils, and a thick mist seemed to fall upon my eyes. I
reeled; my antagonist pressed upon me; and I was just sinking,
faint and breathless, when I heard Mentor cry out: 'O
son of Ulysses, wilt thou be vanquished!' The voice of my
friend encouraged me to further resistance, and disdain supplied
me with new strength. I avoided several blows, which I must
otherwise have sunk under. My antagonist having missed a
stroke, I seized the opportunity, when his arm was carried away
by its own force, and his body was bent forward, to aim a blow
at him that he could not ward off, and I raised my cestus that it
might descend with greater force. He saw my advantage, and,
stepping back, he writhed his body to avoid the stroke. By
this motion the equilibrium was destroyed, and I easily threw
him to the ground. I immediately offered him my hand,
which he refused; and he got up without assistance, covered
with dust and blood; but, though he showed the utmost shame
at his defeat, yet he did not dare to renew the combat.</p>

<p>"The chariot races immediately followed. The chariots
were distributed by lot, and mine happened to be the worst
of the whole number; the wheels were the heaviest, and the
horses the least vigorous. We started; and the cloud of dust
that rose behind us obscured the sky. At the beginning of the
race, I suffered the others to get before me. A young Lacedemonian,
whose name was Grantor, left them all behind him;
and Polycletus, a Cretan, followed him at a short distance.
Hippomachus, a relation of Idomeneus, who was ambitious to
succeed him, giving reins to his horses, which were covered
with sweat, leaned forward over their necks; and the wheels
whirled round with such rapidity, that, like the wings of an
eagle floating upon the air, they seemed not to move at all.
My horses, beginning now to exert themselves, soon left almost
all those that had set out with so much ardor, at a great distance
behind them. Hippomachus, pressing forward to keep
his advantage with too much eagerness, the most vigorous of

<!-- page 232 -->

his horses fell down, and put an end to the hopes of the
driver.</p>

<p>"Polycletus, leaning too much over his horses, was thrown
out of his chariot by a sudden shock; the reins were forced
out of his hand; and, though he had now no hope of victory,
he thought himself happy to have escaped with his life.
Grantor, perceiving with jealousy and indignation that I was
now close behind him, urged forward with more eagerness;
sometimes vowing rich offerings to the gods, and sometimes
encouraging his horses. He was afraid I should pass him, by
driving between his chariot and the barrier of the course, because
my horses, having been less exhausted, were able to get
before him if they had room, though they should wheel round
on the outside of the track. This could be prevented only by
obstructing the passage. Though he saw the danger of the
attempt, he drove up so close to the barrier that his wheel,
being forced against it, was torn off and his chariot dismounted.
I had now nothing to do but to turn short, that I might keep
clear of him, and the next moment he saw me at the goal.
The multitude once more shouted: 'Victory to the son of
Ulysses! It is he whom the gods have appointed to reign
over us!'</p>

<p>"We were then conducted, by the most illustrious and venerable
of the Cretans, into a wood which had been long kept
sacred from the vulgar and the profane, where we were convened
by those aged men who had been appointed by Minos
to preserve the laws from violation, and administer justice to
the people. But into this assembly those only who had contended
in the games were admitted. The sages opened the
book in which all the laws of Minos had been collected. I
was touched with reverence and humility when I approached
these fathers of their country, whom age had rendered venerable
without impairing their vigor of mind. They sat, with
great order and solemnity, in a fixed posture; their hair was
white as snow, but some of them had scarcely any left; and
their countenances, though grave, were brightened with a calm
and placid sagacity.  They were not forward to speak, and

<!-- page 233 -->

they said nothing that was not the result of mature deliberation.
When their opinions were different, they supported
them with so much candor and moderation, that it could
scarcely be believed they were not of one mind. By long experience
and close application, they had acquired the most
acute discernment and extensive knowledge; but that which
principally conduced to the strength and rectitude of their
judgment, was the sedate, dispassionate tranquillity of minds
long freed from the tumultuous passions and capricious levity
of youth. Wisdom alone was their principle of action; and,
by the long and habitual practice of virtue, they had so corrected
every irregular disposition, that they enjoyed the calm
yet elevated delights of reason. To these venerable men I
lifted up my eyes with admiration, and wished that, by a
sudden contraction of my life, I might immediately arrive at
so desirable an old age. I perceived youth to be a state of
infelicity, subject to the blind impetuosity of passion, and far
from the perspicacious tranquillity of their virtue.</p>

<p>"The person who presided in this assembly opened the book
of the laws of Minos. It was a large volume, usually locked
up, with the richest perfumes, in a golden box. When it
was taken out, all the sages kissed it with a profound respect,
and said that, the gods only excepted, from whom all good is
originally derived, nothing should be held so sacred as those
laws which promote wisdom, virtue, and happiness. Those
who put these laws in execution for the government of others,
should also, by these laws, govern themselves. It is the law
that ought to reign, and not the man. Such were the sentiments
of these sages. The president then proposed three
questions, which were to be resolved by the maxims of Minos.</p>

<p>"The first question was: 'What man is most free?' One
answered, that it was a king who governed his people with absolute
authority, and had triumphed over all his enemies.
Another said, that it was he whose riches enabled him to purchase
whatever he desired. In the opinion of some, it was a
man who had never married, and who was perpetually travelling
from one country to another, without subjecting himself

<!-- page 234 -->

to the laws of any. Others supposed it might be a savage
who, living wild in the woods, and subsisting himself by hunting,
was independent of all society, and suffered no want as an
individual. Others thought of a slave immediately after his
emancipation; because, being just relieved from the severities
of servitude, he would have a more lively sense of the sweets
of freedom. And there were some who said that a man at
the point of death was more free than all others, because
death breaks every bond, and over the dead the united world
has no power.</p>

<p>"When my opinion was demanded, I was in no doubt what
to answer, because I remembered what had been often told me
by Mentor. 'The most free of all men,' said I, 'is he whose
freedom slavery itself cannot take away. He, and he only, is
free in every country and in every condition, who fears the
gods, and whose fear has no other object. In other words, he
only is truly free over whom fear and desire have no power,
and who is subject only to reason and the gods.' The fathers
looked upon each other with a smile, and were surprised to
find my answer exactly the same with that of Minos.</p>

<p>"The second question was: 'Who is most unhappy?' To
this every one gave such an answer as was suggested by his
fancy. One said that the most unhappy man was he who was
without money, health, and reputation. Another said, it was
he that had no friend. Some imagined none could be so
wretched as those who had degenerate and ungrateful children.
But a native of Lesbos, a man celebrated for his wisdom, said
that the most unhappy of all men was he that thought himself
so; because unhappiness depends much less upon adversity
than impatience, and unfortunate events derive all their power
to afflict from the minds of those to whom they happen.</p>

<p>"The assembly heard this opinion with a shout of applause;
and every one believed that, in this question, the Lesbian
would be declared victor. But, my opinion being asked, I
formed my answer upon the maxims of Mentor. 'The most
unhappy of all men,' said I, 'is a king who believes he shall
become happy by rendering others miserable: his wretchedness

<!-- page 235 -->

is doubled by his ignorance; for, as he does not know
whence it proceeds, he can apply no remedy; he is, indeed,
afraid to know, and he suffers a crowd of sycophants to surround
him, that keep truth at a distance. He is a slave to his
own passions, and an utter stranger to his duty; he has never
tasted the pleasure of doing good, nor been warmed to sensibility
by the charms of virtue. He is wretched, and the
wretchedness that he suffers he deserves; his misery, however
great, is perpetually increasing; he rushes down the precipice
of perdition, and the gulf of everlasting punishment receives
him.' The assembly attested my victory over the Lesbian, and
the judges declared that I had expressed the sense of Minos.</p>

<p>"The third question was: 'Which of the two ought to be
preferred,&mdash;a king who is invincible in war, or a king who,
without any experience in war, can administer civil government
with great wisdom in a time of peace?' The majority determined
this question in favor of the warrior; 'For skill to
govern in a time of peace,' said they, 'will be of little use, if
the king cannot defend his country in a time of war, since he
will himself be divested of his authority, and his people will
become slaves to the enemy.' Others preferred the pacific
prince; because, as he would have more to fear from a war,
he would be more careful to avoid it. But they were answered
that the achievements of a conqueror would not only increase
his own glory, but the glory of his people to whom he would
subjugate many nations; while under a pacific government,
quiet and security would degenerate into cowardice and sloth.
My sentiments were then asked, and I answered thus: 'Although
he who can only govern either in peace or in war is
but half a king; yet the prince who, by his sagacity, can discover
the merit of others, and can defend his country when it
is attacked, if not in person, yet by his generals, is, in my
opinion, to be preferred before him who knows no art but that
of war. A prince whose genius is entirely military, will levy
endless wars to extend his dominions, and ruin his people to
add a new title to his name. If the people which he now
governs are unhappy, what is it to them how many more nations

<!-- page 236 -->

he conquers! A foreign war, long continued, cannot fail to
produce disorder at home: the manners of the victors themselves
become corrupt during the general convulsion. How
much has Greece suffered by the conquest of Troy! She was
more than ten years deprived of her kings. Wherever the
flame of war is kindled, the laws are violated with impunity,
agriculture is neglected, and the sciences are forgotten. The
best prince, when he has a war to sustain, is compelled to the
same conduct that disgraces the worst, to tolerate license,
and employ villainy in his service. How many daring profligates
are punished in a time of peace, whom it is necessary to
reward during the disorders of war! No nation was ever
governed by a conqueror that did not suffer by his ambition.
The victorious and the vanquished are involved almost in the
same ruin, while the king grows giddy amid the tumult of
triumph. As he is utterly ignorant of the arts of peace, he
knows not how to derive any popular advantages from a successful
war; he is like a man that not only defends his own
field, but forcibly takes possession of his neighbor's, yet can
neither plough nor sow, and consequently reaps no harvest
from either. Such a man seems born, not to diffuse happiness
among his subjects, by a wise and equitable government, but
to fill the world with violence, tumult, and desolation.</p>

<p>" 'As to the pacific prince, it must indeed be confessed that
he is not qualified for conquest: or, in other words, he is not
born to harass his people by perpetual hostilities, in a restless
attempt to subjugate others, over whom he can have no equitable
right; but if he is perfectly fitted for peaceful government,
he has all the qualities that will secure his subjects against the
encroachments of an enemy. His justice, moderation, and
quietness render him a good neighbor; he engages in no enterprise
that can interrupt the peace subsisting between him
and other States, and he fulfils all his engagements with a
religious exactness. He is, therefore, regarded by his allies
rather with love than fear, and they trust him with unlimited
confidence. If any restless, haughty, and ambitious power
should molest him, all the neighboring princes will interpose in

<!-- page 237 -->

his behalf; because from him they apprehend no attempt
against their own quiet, but have every thing to fear from his
enemy. His steady justice, impartiality, and public faith
render him the arbiter of all the kingdoms that surround his
own. While the enterprises of ambition make the warrior
odious, and the common danger unites the world against him,
a glory, superior to that of conquest, comes unlooked for to
the friend of peace. On him the eyes of other potentates are
turned with reverence and affection, as on the father and the
guardian of them all.<sup id="t_ref085"><a href="#t_en085">85</a></sup></p>

<p>" 'Such are his advantages abroad; and those at home are
yet more considerable. If he is qualified to govern in peace, it
follows that he must govern by the wisest laws. He must
restrain parade and luxury; he must suppress all arts which
can only gratify vice; and he must encourage those which
supply the necessaries of life, especially agriculture, to which
the principal attention of his people must be turned. Whatever
is necessary will then become abundant. The people,
being inured to labor, simple in their manners, habituated to
live upon a little, and therefore easily gaining a subsistence
from the field, will multiply without end. This kingdom,
then, will soon become extremely populous, and the people
will be healthful, vigorous, and hardy; not effeminated by
luxury, but veterans in virtue; not slavishly attached to a life
of voluptuous indolence, but free in a magnanimous contempt
of death, and choosing rather to die than to lose the many
privileges which they enjoy under a prince who reigns only
as the substitute of Reason. If a neighboring conqueror
should attack such a people as this, he might probably find
them unskilful in making a camp, in forming the order of
battle, and in managing the engines of destruction that are
used in a siege; but he would find them invincible by their
numbers, their courage, their patience of fatigue, their habit
of enduring hardship, the impetuosity of their attack, and the

<!-- page 238 -->

perseverance of that virtue which disappointment cannot subdue.
Besides, if their prince is not himself qualified to command
his forces, he may substitute such persons as he knows
to be equal to the trust, and use them as instruments, without
giving up his authority. Succors may be obtained from his
allies; his subjects will rather perish than become the slaves of
injustice and oppression: the gods themselves will fight in his
behalf. Thus will the pacific prince be sustained, when his
danger is most imminent.</p>

<p>" 'I conclude, therefore, that though his ignorance in the art
of war is an imperfection in his character, since it incapacitates
him to execute one of the principal duties of his station&mdash;the
chastisement of those who invade his dominion or injure his
people; yet he is infinitely superior to a king who is wholly
unacquainted with civil government, and knows no art but that
of war.'</p>

<p>"I perceived that many persons in the assembly did not
approve the opinion that I had been laboring to maintain; for
the greater part of mankind, dazzled by the false lustre of victories
and triumphs, prefer the tumult and show of successful
hostilities to the quiet simplicity of peace and the intrinsic
advantages of good government. The judges, however, declared
that I had spoken the sentiments of Minos; and the
president cried out: 'The oracle of Apollo, known to all
Crete, is fulfilled. Minos inquired of the god how long his
posterity should govern by the laws which he had established.
The god answered: 'Thy posterity shall cease to reign when
a stranger shall establish the reign of thy laws.' We feared
that some foreigner would make a conquest of our island; but
the misfortunes of Idomeneus, and the wisdom of the son of
Ulysses, who, of all mortals, best understands the laws of
Minos, have disclosed the true sense of the oracle. Why, then,
do we delay to crown him whom the gods has appointed to
be our king?' "</p>

<p>"The sages immediately went out of the consecrated grove:
and the chief of them, taking me by the hand, declared to the
people, who were waiting impatiently for the decision, that the

<!-- page 239 -->

prize had been decreed to me. The words were no sooner
uttered, than the dead silence of expectation was followed by
a universal shout. Every one cried out, 'Let the son of
Ulysses, a second Minos, be our king!' and the echoes of the
neighboring mountain repeated the acclamation.</p>

<p>"I waited a few moments, and then made a sign with my
hand that I desired to be heard. In this interval Mentor
whispered to me: 'Wilt thou renounce thy country? Can
ambition obliterate the remembrance of Penelope, who longs
for thy return as the last object of her hope; and alienate thy
heart from the great Ulysses, whom the gods have resolved to
restore to Ithaca?' These words pierced my heart, and the
fond desire of royalty was instantly absorbed in the love of
my parents and my country.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, the multitude had again become motionless
and silent; and I addressed them in these terms: 'Illustrious Cretans,
I am not worthy of the dignity which you
offer. The oracle, of which you have been reminded, does
indeed express, that the sovereignty of Crete shall depart from
the race of Minos, when a stranger shall establish the dominion
of his laws; but it does not say, that this stranger shall
be king. I am willing to believe that I am the stranger foretold
by the oracle, and that I have accomplished the prediction.
Fortune has cast me upon this island; I have discovered the
true sense of the laws of Minos, and I wish that my explanation
of these laws may establish their dominion with the man
whom you shall choose. As for me, I prefer my country, the
obscure and inconsiderable island of Ithaca, to the hundred
cities of Crete, with all their opulence and glory. Permit me,
then, to follow the course marked out for me by the Fates. If
I have contended in your sports, I was not prompted by a desire
to govern you; but only to obtain your esteem and your
pity, that you might the more readily afford me the means of
returning to the place of my birth; for I would rather obey
my father Ulysses, and comfort Penelope my mother, than
govern all the nations upon earth. You see, O Cretans, the
secret recesses of my heart. I am compelled to leave you;

<!-- page 240 -->

but death only can put an end to my gratitude. Your interest
shall never be less dear to me than my own honor; and I will
remember you with affection, till I draw my last breath.'</p>

<p>"I had scarcely finished the last sentence, when there arose,
from the innumerable multitude that surrounded me, a deep
hoarse murmur, like the sound of waves that are broken
against each other in a storm. Some questioned whether I
was not a god under the appearance of a man. Others affirmed
that they had seen me in foreign countries, and knew
me to be Telemachus. Many cried out, that I should be compelled
to ascend the throne of Idomeneus. I therefore again
signified my intention to speak; and they were again silent in
a moment, not knowing but that I was now about to accept
what before I had refused.</p>

<p>" 'Permit me,' said I, 'O Cretans, to tell you my thoughts
without disguise. I believe you to be the wisest of all people;
and yet there is one important distinction which I think you
have not made. You ought not to select the man who is best
acquainted with the theory of your laws; but him who, with
the most steady virtue, has reduced them to practice. I am,
as yet, but a youth, and consequently without experience, and
subject to the tyranny of impetuous passions: I am in that
state which renders it more fit for me to learn, by obedience,
how to command hereafter, than how to command at present.
Do not, therefore, seek a man, who, in any exercises, either of
the mind or of the body, has conquered others, but one who
has achieved the conquest of himself. Seek a man who has
the laws of Minos written upon his heart, and whose life has
illustrated every precept by an example: let your choice be
determined, not by what he says, but by what he has done.'</p>

<p>"The venerable fathers, being much pleased with these
sentiments, and hearing the applause of the assembly grow
still louder, addressed me in these terms: 'Since the gods no
longer permit us to hope that you will reign over us, assist us.
at least, in the choice of a king who will establish the reign
of our laws. Is any man known to you, who, upon a throne,
will be content with this equitable though limited authority?'

<!-- page 241 -->

'I know a man,' said I, 'to whom I owe whatever merit I
possess, whose wisdom has spoken by my lips, and whose conversation
suggested every sentiment which you have approved.'</p>

<p>"While I was yet speaking, the eyes of the whole assembly
were turned upon Mentor, whom I took by the hand and presented
to them. At the same time, I related the protection
which he had afforded to my infancy, the dangers from which
he had delivered me, and the calamities that fell upon me
when I rejected his counsel.</p>

<p>"Mentor had, till now, stood unnoticed among the crowd;
for his dress was plain and negligent, his countenance was
modest, and he spoke little, and had an air of coldness and
reserve. But as soon as he became the object of attention, a
dignity and firmness, not to be described, were exhibited in
his countenance; it was observed that his eyes were peculiarly
piercing, and that every motion expressed uncommon
vigor. Some questions were proposed: his answers excited
universal admiration; and the kingdom was immediately offered
to him. The kingdom, however, he refused without the
least emotion, and said that he preferred the sweets of a private
life to the splendors of royalty, that the best princes were
almost necessarily unhappy, because they were seldom able to
effect the good which they designed; and were often betrayed,
by the circumvention of sycophants, to the perpetration of
evils which they intended to prevent. 'If servitude,' continued
he, 'is a state of wretchedness, there can be no happiness
in royalty; for royalty is nothing more than servitude
in disguise. A king is always dependent upon those by whom
he must enforce his commands. Happy are they to whom
the toil of government is not a duty&mdash;a duty which implies he
sacrifice of private liberty to public advantage, which our
country only can claim, and which those alone who are invested
with supreme authority can owe.'</p>

<p>"The Cretans were at first struck silent with astonishment,
but, at length, they asked Mentor what person he would advise
them to choose. 'I would advise you,' said Mentor, 'to

<!-- page 242 -->

choose a man who knows well the people he is to govern,
and who is also sufficiently acquainted with government to fear
it as a state of difficulty and danger. He that desires royalty
and does not know the duties which royalty requires (and by
him who does not know them they can never be fulfilled)&mdash;such
a man desires regal authority only to gratify himself.
But regal authority should be intrusted with him only who
would not accept it but for the love of others.'</p>

<p>"The whole assembly, wondering to see two strangers refuse
a kingdom which so many others had sought, began to
inquire with whom they had come to Crete. Nausicrates, who
had conducted us from the port to the circus, immediately
pointed to Hazael, with whom Mentor and myself had sailed
from the island of Cyprus. But their wonder became still
greater, when they understood that he, who had just refused
to be the sovereign of Crete, had been lately the slave of Hazael;
that Hazael, struck with the wisdom and virtue of his
slave, now considered him as his monitor and his friend, and
had been urged, merely by his desire of knowledge, to travel
from Damascus in Syria to Crete, that he might acquaint himself
with the laws of Minos.</p>

<p>"The sages then addressed themselves to Hazael. 'We do
not dare,' said they, 'to offer Hazael the crown which has been
refused by Mentor, because we believe the sentiments of both
to be the same. You despise mankind too much to rule them;
nor is there any thing in wealth or in power that would compensate
you for the toils of government.' Hazael replied:
'Think not, O Cretans, that I despise mankind, or that I am
insensible to the glory that rewards the labor by which they
are rendered virtuous and happy. This labor, however glorious,
is attended with pain and danger; and the external glitter
of regal pomp captivates only the foolish and the vain. Life
is short, and greatness rather incites than gratifies desire: it
is one of those deceitful acquisitions which I have come so far,
not to obtain, but to learn how to despise. Farewell! I have
no wish but to return once more to retirement and tranquillity
where my soul may feast on knowledge with divine reflection,

<!-- page 243 -->

and where that hope of immortality which is derived from virtue
may afford me comfort under the infirmities of old age.
If I have a wish besides this, it is never to be separated from
the two men who now stand before you.'</p>

<p>"The Cretans then cried out to Mentor: 'Tell us, O wisest
and greatest of mortals, tell us who shall be our king! We
will not suffer thee to depart till thou hast directed this important
choice.' Mentor immediately answered: 'As I stood
among the crowd of spectators, whom the sports had drawn
together, I perceived a man who, in the midst of all that tumult
and impatience, appeared collected and sedate; and still
vigorous, though advanced in years. Upon inquiring who he
was, I soon learned that his name was Aristodemus. I afterwards
heard some that stood near tell him that his two sons
were among the candidates; but he expressed no satisfaction
at the news. He said that he loved one of them too well to
wish him involved in the dangers of royalty, and that he had
too great a regard for his country to wish it should be governed
by the other. I immediately perceived that the old man
loved one of his sons, who had virtue, with a rational affection;
and that he was too wise to indulge the other in vicious irregularities.
My curiosity being now greatly increased, I inquired
more particularly into the circumstances of his life. One of
the citizens gave me this account: 'Aristodemus,' said he,
'bore arms in the service of his country for many years, and
is almost covered with scars, but his abhorrence of insincerity
and flattery rendered him disagreeable to Idomeneus, who
therefore left him in Crete when he went to the siege of Troy:
and, indeed, he was kept in perpetual anxiety by a man who
gave him such counsel as he could not but approve, yet wanted
resolution to follow; he was, besides, jealous of the glory which
he knew Aristodemus would soon acquire. The king, therefore,
forgetting the services of his soldier, left him here exposed
to the distresses of poverty, and to the scorn of the
brutal and the sordid, who consider nothing as merit but
riches. With poverty, however, Aristodemus was contented,
and lived cheerfully in a remote corner of the island, where he

<!-- page 244 -->

cultivated a few acres of ground with his own hand. In this
employment he was assisted by one of his sons, whom he
loved with great tenderness. Labor and frugality soon made
them happy in the possession of whatever is necessary to a life
of rural simplicity, and something more. The wise old man
distributed this surplus among the decrepit and the sick. He
stimulated the young to industry; he exhorted the refractory,
and instructed the ignorant; he was the arbiter of every dispute,
and the father of every family. In his own family, he
considers no circumstance as unfortunate but the bad disposition
of his second son, upon whom all admonition has been
lost. The father, after having long endured his irregularities,
in hopes that some means would be found to correct them, has
at length expelled him from his house. The son has since
given himself up to the grossest sensuality; and, in the folly
of his ambition, has become a candidate for the kingdom.'</p>

<p>" 'Such, O Cretans, is the account that was given me of
Aristodemus. Whether it is true or false, is best known to
you. But, if this man is, indeed, such as he has been represented,
why have public games been appointed, and why have
so many strangers been brought together? You have, in the
midst of you, a man whom you well know, and by whom you
are well known; a man to whom all the arts of war are
familiar, and whose courage has sustained him, not only against
the spear and the dart, but against the formidable assaults of
poverty; who has despised the riches that are acquired by
flattery; who has preferred labor to idleness, and knows the
advantages which are derived to the public from agriculture;
who is an enemy to parade and pomp; whose passions are
under the control of reason&mdash;for even the parental affection,
which in others is so often a blind instinct, acts in him as a
rational and a moral principle; since, of two sons, he cherishes
one for his virtue, and renounces the other for his vices;&mdash;a
man who, in a word, is already the father of the people. In
this man, therefore, O Cretans, if, indeed, you desire to be
governed by the laws of Minos, behold your king!'</p>

<p>"The multitude immediately cried out, with one voice:

<!-- page 245 -->

'Aristodemus is, indeed, such as he has been represented;
Aristodemus is worthy to be our king!' The fathers of the
council then ordered that he should be brought before them;
and he was immediately sought among the crowd, where he
was mixed with the lowest of the people. When he was
brought before the assembly, he appeared calm and unconcerned.
When he was told that the people had determined to
make him king, he answered, that he would not accept of the
office but upon three conditions. 'First,' says he, 'the throne
shall be declared vacant at the end of two years, if within that
time I do not render you better than you are; or if you shall
resist the execution of the laws. Secondly; I shall be still at
liberty to live in a simple and frugal manner. Thirdly; my
sons shall not rank above their fellow-citizens; and, after my
death, shall be treated, without distinction, according to their
merit.'</p>

<p>"At these words the air was filled with acclamations of joy.
The diadem was placed upon the head of Aristodemus by the
chief of the hoary guardians of the law. Sacrifices were offered
to Jupiter and the other superior deities. Aristodemus made
us presents, not with an ostentatious magnificence, but with a
noble simplicity. He gave to Hazael a copy of the laws of
Minos, written by the legislator himself and a collection of
tracts, which contained a complete history of Crete, from the
time of Saturn and the golden age. He sent on board his
vessel every kind of fruit that flourishes in Crete and is unknown
in Syria; and offered him whatever he might need.</p>

<p>"As we were now impatient to depart, he caused a vessel to
be immediately fitted out for us; he manned it with a great
number of able rowers and a detachment of his best troops;
and he put on board several changes of apparel and a great
plenty of provisions. As soon as the vessel was ready to sail,
the wind became fair for Ithaca; but, as Hazael was bound on
a contrary course, it compelled him to continue at Crete. He
took leave of us with great tenderness, and embraced us as
friends, with whom he was about to part for life. 'The gods,'
said he, 'are just; they know that the sacred bond of our

<!-- page 246 -->

friendship is virtue; and, therefore, they will hereafter restore
us to each other; and those happy fields, in which the just are
said to enjoy everlasting rest, shall see our spirits reunited to
part no more. Oh, that my ashes also might be mingled
with yours!' Here his words became inarticulate, and he
burst into tears. Our eyes overflowed with equal tenderness
and grief.</p>

<p>"Our parting with Aristodemus was scarcely less affectionate.
'As you have made me a king,' said he, 'remember the
dangers to which you have exposed me. Request the gods to
irradiate my mind with wisdom from above, and give me power
over myself in proportion to my authority over others. May
they conduct you in safety to your country, abase the insolence
of your enemies, and give you the joy of beholding Ulysses
again upon the throne of Ithaca, supremely happy in the possession
of Penelope and peace. To thee, Telemachus, I have
given a good vessel, well manned with mariners and soldiers,
who may assist thee against the persecutors of thy mother.
For thee, Mentor, thy wisdom is sufficient: possessing this,
thou hast need of nothing: all that I can give would be superfluous;
all that I can wish is precluded. Go, both of you, in
peace; and may you long be the felicity of each other; remember
Aristodemus; and if Ithaca should need the assistance
of Crete, depend upon my friendship to the last hour of
my life.' He then embraced us; and we could not restrain
our tears, while thanking him.</p>

<p>"The wind, which now swelled our sails, promised us a
happy voyage. Mount Ida already appeared but like a hillock,
the shores of Crete in a short time totally disappeared, and
the coast of Peloponnesus seemed to advance into the sea
to meet us. But a tempest suddenly obscured the sky, and
roused the billows of the deep. Night<sup id="t_ref086"><a href="#t_en086">86</a></sup> rushed upon us unawares,
and death presented himself in all his terrors. It was
thy awful trident, O Neptune, that agitated the ocean to its

<!-- page 247 -->

remotest shores.<sup id="t_ref087"><a href="#t_en087">87</a></sup> Venus, to revenge the contempt with which
we had treated her, even in her temple at Cythera, hasted to
the father of the floods, whom she addressed with a voice
broken by grief, and her eyes swimming in tears (thus, at
least, I have been informed by Mentor, who is acquainted with
celestial things). 'Wilt thou suffer,' said she, 'these impious
men to deride my power, and escape unpunished? My power
has been confessed by the gods themselves, and yet all that
is done in my favorite island these presumptuous mortals have
dared to condemn. They take pride in a frigid wisdom, never
warmed by the rays of beauty; and they despise, as folly, the
delights of love. Hast thou forgotten that I was born in thy
dominions? Wherefore dost thou delay to overwhelm the
wretches whom I abhor?'</p>

<p>"Neptune immediately swelled the waves into mountains,
that reached the skies; and Venus, smiling upon the storm,
believed our shipwreck to be inevitable. Our pilot cried out,
in confusion and despair, that he could no longer withstand
the fury of the winds, which drove us upon the rocks<sup id="t_ref088"><a href="#t_en088">88</a></sup> with
irresistible violence; our mast was broken by a sudden gust;<sup id="t_ref089"><a href="#t_en089">89</a></sup>
and the moment after we heard the points of the rocks that
were under water tear open the bottom of our vessel. The
water flowing in on every side, the vessel sunk, and the mariners
sent up a cry of distress to heaven. I ran to Mentor, and,
throwing my arms round him, said: 'Death is now indeed
upon us; let us meet him with intrepidity. The gods have
delivered us from so many dangers only that we may perish
in this. Let us die then, my dear Mentor; it is some consolation

<!-- page 248 -->

to me that I die with you; and it would be hopeless
labor to dispute life with the storm.'</p>

<p>"Mentor answered: 'True courage never sits down inactive
in despair. It is not enough to expect death with tranquillity;
we ought, without dreading the event, to continue our utmost
efforts against it. Let us lay hold on some fragment of the
vessel; and, while this affrighted and confused multitude
deplore the loss of life, without attempting to preserve it, let
us try at least to preserve our own.' While he was yet speaking,
he snatched up an axe and divided the splinter that still
held the broken mast together, which, falling across the vessel,
had laid it on one side. The top of the mast already lay in
the water; and Mentor, now pushing off the other end, leaped<sup id="t_ref090"><a href="#t_en090">90</a></sup>
upon it himself in the midst of the waves, and, calling me by
my name, encouraged me to follow him. As a mighty oak,
when the winds combine against it, stands firm on its root,
and its leaves<sup id="t_ref091"><a href="#t_en091">91</a></sup> only are shaken by the tempest, so Mentor, who
was not only fearless, but serene, appeared superior to the power
of the winds and waves. I followed him; and the force of his
example who could have resisted?</p>

<p>"We steered ourselves upon the floating mast, which was
more than sufficient to sustain us both, and therefore rendered
us a most important service; for if we had been obliged to
swim merely by our own effort, our strength must have been
exhausted. The mast, however, on which we sat, was often
overwhelmed by the tempest, notwithstanding its bulk, so that
we were often plunged under the water, which rushed in at our
mouths, ears, and nostrils; and it was not without the utmost
labor and difficulty that we recovered our seat. Sometimes a
wave that was swelled into a mountain rolled over us, and
then we kept our hold with all our might, lest the mast, which

<!-- page 249 -->

was our only hope, should be driven from under us in the
shock.</p>

<p>"While we were in this dreadful situation, Mentor, who
possessed the same tranquillity on the fragment of a wreck
that he does now on that bank of turf, addressed me in these
words: 'Canst thou believe, Telemachus, that the winds and
waves are the arbiters of life and death? Can they cause thee
to perish otherwise that as they fulfil the command of heaven?
Every event is determined by the gods; let the gods, therefore,
and not the sea, be the object of thy fear. Wert thou
already at the bottom of this abyss, the hand of Jove could
draw thee forth; or shouldst thou be exalted to the summit of
Olympus, and behold the stars rolling under thy feet,<sup id="t_ref092"><a href="#t_en092">92</a></sup> the hand
of Jove could again plunge thee into the deep, or cast thee
headlong into hell.' I heard and admired this discourse; but
though it gave me some comfort, my mind was too much
depressed and confused to reply. He saw me not, nor could I
see him. We passed the whole night, shivering with cold, in
a state between life and death, driving before the storm, and
not knowing on what shore we should be cast. At length,
however, the impetuosity of the wind began to abate; and the
sea resembled a person whose anger, after having been long
indulged in tumult and outrage, is exhausted by its own vehemence,
and subsides in murmurs and discontent. The noise of
the surge gradually died away, and the waves were not higher
than the ridges that are left by the plough.</p>

<p>"And now Aurora threw open the gates of heaven to the
sun, and cheered us with the promise of a better day. The
east glowed as if on fire; and the stars, which had been so
long hidden, just appeared, and fled at the approach of Ph&oelig;bus.
We now descried land at a distance; the breeze wafted
us towards it, and hope revived in my bosom. But we looked
round in vain for our companions, who probably resigned

<!-- page 250 -->

themselves to the tempest in despair, and sunk with the vessel.
As we approached nearer to the shore, the sea drove us upon
the rocks, against which we should have been dashed in
pieces, but that we received the shock against the end of the
mast, which Mentor rendered as serviceable upon this occasion
as the best rudder could have been in the hands of the most
skilful pilot. Thus, having passed the rocks in safety, we
found the rest of the coast rising from the sea with a smooth
and easy ascent; and, floating at ease upon a gentle tide, we
soon reached the sand with our feet. There we were discovered
by thee, O goddess, and by thee benignly received."</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb06">BOOK VI.</h2>

<p class="small">Calypso admires Telemachus for his adventures, and exerts all her power
to detain him in her island, by inciting him to return her passion; but
he is sustained by the wisdom and friendship of Mentor, as well against
her artifices as against the power of Cupid, whom Venus sends to her
assistance. Telemachus, however, and Eucharis become mutually enamored
of each other, which provokes Calypso first to jealousy, and then
to rage. She swears, by the Styx, that Telemachus shall leave her island,
and engages Mentor to build a ship to take him back to Ithaca. She is
consoled by Cupid, who excites the nymphs to burn the vessel which
had been built by Mentor, while Mentor was laboring to get Telemachus
onboard. Telemachus is touched with a secret joy at this event. Mentor,
who perceives it, throws him from a rock into the sea, and leaps
after him, that they may swim to another vessel which appeared not far
distant from the shore.</p>

<p>WHEN Telemachus had concluded the relation of his adventures,
the nymphs, whose eyes had till then been immovably
fixed upon him, looked at each other with a mixture of astonishment
and delight. "What men," said they, "are these!
In the fortunes of whom else would the gods have taken part;
and of whom else could such wonders have been related?
Ulysses is already surpassed in eloquence, in wisdom, and in
courage, by his son. What an aspect! what manly beauty!
what a mixture of dignity and complaisance, of firmness and
modesty! If he was not known to be born of a mortal, he
might easily be mistaken for a god&mdash;for Bacchus, for Mercury,
or perhaps, even for Apollo himself!<sup id="t_ref093"><a href="#t_en093">93</a></sup> But who is this Mentor?
His first appearance is that of a man obscurely born,
and of a mean condition; but when he is examined with attention,

<!-- page 252 -->

something inexpressible is discovered, something that
is more than mortal!"</p>

<p>Calypso heard these exclamations with a confusion she could
not hide; her eyes were incessantly glancing from Mentor to
Telemachus, and from Telemachus to Mentor. She was often
about to request a repetition of the story to which she had
listened with so much delight, and as often suppressed her desire.<sup id="t_ref094"><a href="#t_en094">94</a></sup>
At length she rose hastily from her seat, and, taking
Telemachus with her, retired to a neighboring grove of myrtle,
where she labored with all her art to learn from him whether
Mentor was not a deity concealed under a human form. It
was not, however, in the power of Telemachus to satisfy her
curiosity; for Minerva, who accompanied him in the likeness
of Mentor, thought him too young to be trusted with the secret,
and made the confidant of her designs. She was, besides,
desirous to prove him in the greatest dangers; and no fortitude
would have been necessary to sustain him against any
evil, however dreadful and however near, if he had known
himself to be under the immediate protection of Minerva. As
Telemachus, therefore, mistook his divine companion for Mentor,
all the artifices of Calypso to discover what she wished to
know were ineffectual.</p>

<p>In the mean time the nymphs who had been left with Mentor
gathered round him, and amused themselves by asking him
questions. One inquired the particulars of his journey into
Ethiopia; another desired to know what he had seen at Damascus;
and a third asked him whether he had known Ulysses
before the siege of Troy. Mentor answered them all with
complaisance and affability; and though he used no studied
ornaments of speech, yet his expression was not only significant
but graceful.</p>

<p>The return of Calypso soon put an end to this conversation:
her nymphs then began to gather flowers, and to sing for the
amusement of Telemachus; and she took Mentor aside, that

<!-- page 253 -->

she might, if possible, discover who he was from his own discourse.
The words of Calypso were wont to steal upon the
heart, as sleep steals upon the eyes of the weary, with a sweet
and gentle though irresistible influence; but in Mentor there
was something which defeated her eloquence and eluded her
beauty&mdash;something as much superior to the power of Calypso
as the rock that hides its foundation in the earth, and its summit
in the clouds, is superior to the wind that beats against it.
He stood immovable<sup id="t_ref095"><a href="#t_en095">95</a></sup> in the purposes of his own wisdom, and
suffered the goddess to exert all her arts against him with the
utmost indifference and security. Sometimes he would let
her deceive herself with the hope of having embarrassed him
by her questions, and betrayed him into the involuntary discovery
of himself; but, just as she thought her curiosity was
on the point of being gratified, her expectations were suddenly
disappointed, all her conjectures were overthrown, and, by
some short and unexpected answer, she was again overwhelmed
in perplexity and doubt.</p>

<p>In this manner Calypso passed one day after another; sometimes
endeavoring to gain the heart of Telemachus by flattery,
and sometimes laboring to alienate him from Mentor, of whom
she no longer hoped to obtain the intelligence she desired.
She employed her most beautiful nymphs to inflame the breast
of the young hero with desire, and she was assisted in her
designs against him by a deity whose power was superior to
her own.</p>

<p>Venus burned with resentment against Mentor and Telemachus,
for having treated the worship which she received at
Cyprus with disdain; and their escape from the tempest, which
had been raised against them by Neptune, filled her breast
with indignation and grief. She therefore complained of her
disappointment and her wrongs to Jupiter, and from his superior

<!-- page 254 -->

power she hoped more effectual redress. But the father
of the gods only smiled at her complaint; and, without acquainting
her that Telemachus had been preserved by Minerva
in the likeness of Mentor, he left her at liberty to gratify her
resentment as she could.</p>

<p>The goddess immediately quitted Olympus; and thoughtless
of all the rich perfumes that were rising from her altars at
Cythera, Idalia, and Paphos, mounted her chariot, and called
her son. The grief which was diffused over her countenance
rather increased than diminished her beauty, and she addressed
the god of love in these terms:</p>

<p>"Who, my son, shall henceforth burn incense upon our
altars,<sup id="t_ref096"><a href="#t_en096">96</a></sup> if those who despise our power escape unpunished?
The wretches who have thus offended with impunity are before
thee; make haste, therefore, to secure our honor, and let thy
arrows pierce them to the heart: go down with me to that
island, and I will speak to Calypso." The goddess shook the
reins as she spoke; and, gliding through the air, surrounded
by a cloud which the sun had tinged with a golden hue, she
presented herself before Calypso, who was sitting pensive and
alone by the side of a fountain, at some distance from her
grotto.</p>

<p>"Unhappy goddess!" said she, "thou hast already been
despised and deserted by Ulysses, whom the ties, not only of
love, but of gratitude should have bound to thee; and the son,
yet more obdurate than the father, is now preparing to repeat
the insult. But love comes in person to avenge thee; I will
leave him with thee; and he shall remain among the nymphs
of this island as Bacchus did once among those of the island
of Naxos<sup id="t_ref097"><a href="#t_en097">97</a></sup>, who cherished him in his infancy. Telemachus will
regard him, not as a deity, but as a child; and, not being on
his guard against him, will be too sensible of his power."  The

<!-- page 255 -->

Queen of Beauty, then turning from Calypso, reascended to
Olympus in the golden cloud from which she had alighted
upon the earth, and left behind her a train of celestial fragrance,<sup id="t_ref098"><a href="#t_en098">98</a></sup>
which, expanding by degrees, filled all the groves of
Calypso with perfumes.</p>

<p>Cupid remained in the arms of Calypso. Though she was
herself a deity, yet she felt his fires diffused in her breast. It
happened that a nymph, whose name was Eucharis, was now
near her, and Calypso put the boy into her arms. This was
a present relief; but, alas! it was purchased too dear. The
boy seemed at first to be harmless, gentle, lovely, and engaging.
His playful caresses and perpetual smiles might well have
persuaded all about him that he was born only to delight; but
the moment the heart is open to his endearments, it feels that
they have a malignant power. He is, beyond conception,
deceitful and malicious; his caresses have no view but to
betray; and his smiles have no cause, but the mischiefs that he
has perpetrated, or that he meditates.</p>

<p>But, with all his power and all his subtlety, he did not dare
to approach Mentor. In Mentor there was a severity of virtue
that intimidated and kept him at a distance; he knew also, by
a secret sensation, that this inscrutable stranger could not be
wounded by his arrows. The nymphs, indeed, were soon sensible
of his power; but the wound which they could not cure,
they were very careful to conceal.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Telemachus, who saw the boy playing
sometimes with one of these nymphs and sometimes with another,
was surprised at his sweetness and beauty. He sometimes
pressed him to his bosom, sometimes set him on his
knee, and frequently took him in his arms. It was not long
before he became sensible of a certain disquietude, of which he
could not discover the cause;<sup id="t_ref099"><a href="#t_en099">99</a></sup> and the more he endeavored to

<!-- page 256 -->

remove it by innocent amusements, the more restless and enervated
he grew. "The nymphs of Calypso," said he to Mentor
"are very different from the women of Cyprus, whose indecent
behavior rendered them disgusting in spite of their charms.
In these immortal beauties there is an innocence, a modesty
a simplicity, which it is impossible not to admire and love."
The youth blushed as he spoke, though he knew not why.
He could neither forbear speaking, nor go on with his discourse,<sup id="t_ref100"><a href="#t_en100">100</a></sup>
which was interrupted and incoherent, always obscure,
and sometimes quite unintelligible.</p>

<p>"O Telemachus," said Mentor to him, "the dangers to
which you were exposed in the isle of Cyprus were nothing in
comparison with those which you do not now suspect. Vice,
when it is undisguised, never fails to excite horror; we are
indignant at the wanton who has thrown off all restraint; but
our danger is much greater when the appearance of modesty
remains; we then persuade ourselves that virtue only has
excited our love, and give ourselves up to a deceitful passion,
of which beauty is indeed the object, and which we seldom
learn to distrust till it is too strong to be subdued. Fly, therefore,
dear Telemachus, from these fatal beauties, who appear to
be virtuous, only that they may deceive the confidence they
raise; fly from the dangers to which you are here exposed by
your youth; but, above all, fly from this boy, whom you do
not dread only because you do not know him. This boy is
Cupid, whom his mother has brought into this island to punish
us for treating her worship at Cyprus with contempt; he has
already pierced the heart of Calypso, who is enamored of you;
he has inflamed all the beauties of her train; and his fires have
reached even thy breast, O unhappy youth, although thou
knowest it not!"</p>

<p>Telemachus often interrupted Mentor during this admonition.
"Why," said he, "should we not continue in this island?
Ulysses is no longer a sojourner upon the earth; he has, without

<!-- page 257 -->

doubt, been long buried in the deep: Penelope, after
waiting in vain, not only for his return, but for mine, must
have yielded to the importunities of some fortunate suitor
among the number that surrounds her, especially as it can
scarcely be supposed but that her father Icarus must have
exerted his paternal authority to oblige her to accept another
husband. For what, then, can I return to Ithaca, but to see
her disgraced by a new alliance, and be witness to the violation
of that truth which she plighted to my father? And if
Penelope has thus forgotten Ulysses, it cannot be thought that
he is remembered by the people. Neither, indeed, can we
hope to get alive into the island; for her suitors will certainly
have placed, at every port, a band of ruffians, to cut us off at
our return."</p>

<p>"All that you have said," replied Mentor, "is only another
proof that you are under the influence of a foolish and fatal
passion. You labor with great subtlety to find every argument
that can favor it, and to avoid all those by which it would be
condemned. You are ingenious only to deceive yourself, and
to secure forbidden pleasures from the intrusion of remorse.
Have you forgotten that the gods themselves have interposed
to favor your return? Was not your escape from Sicily
supernatural? Were not the misfortunes that you suffered in
Egypt converted into sudden and unexpected prosperity? and
were not the dangers which threatened you at Tyre averted
by an invisible hand? Is it possible that, after so many miracles,
you should still doubt to what end you have been preserved?
But why do I remonstrate? Of the good fortune
that was designed for thee, thou art unworthy. As for myself,
I make no doubt but I shall find means to quit this island;
and if here thou art determined to stay, here am I determined
to leave thee. In this place let the degenerate son of the great
Ulysses hide himself among women, in the shameful obscurity
of voluptuousness and sloth; and stoop, even in spite of heaven,
to that which his father disdained."</p>

<p>This reproach, so forcible and so keen, pierced Telemachus
to the heart. He was melted with tenderness and grief; but

<!-- page 258 -->

his grief was mingled with shame, and his shame with fear.
He dreaded the resentment of Mentor, and the loss of that
companion to whose sagacity and kindness he was so much
indebted. But, at the same time, the passion which had just
taken possession of his breast, and to which he was himself a
stranger, made him still tenacious of his purpose. "What!"
said he to Mentor, with tears in his eyes, "do you reckon as
nothing that immortality which I may now share with Calypso?"
"I hold as nothing," replied Mentor, "all that is contrary
to the dictates of virtue and to the commands of heaven.
Virtue now calls you back to your country, to Ulysses, and to
Penelope. Virtue forbids you to give up your heart to an unworthy
passion. The gods, who have delivered you from so
many dangers, that your name might not be less illustrious
than that of Ulysses, command you to quit this island. Only
the tyranny of love can detain you here. Immortality! alas,
what is immortality without liberty, without virtue, and without
honor? Is it not a state of misery without hope&mdash;still
more deplorable, as it can never end?"</p>

<p>To this expostulation Telemachus replied only by sighs.
Sometimes he almost wished that Mentor would force him
from the island in spite of himself; sometimes he was impatient
to be left behind, that he might be at liberty to gratify his
wishes without fearing to be reproached for his weakness. A
thousand different wishes and desires maintained a perpetual
conflict in his breast, and were predominant by turns. His
mind, therefore, was like the sea when agitated by contending
winds. Sometimes he threw himself on the ground near the
sea, and remained a long time extended motionless on the
beach; sometimes he hid himself in the gloomy recesses of a
wood, where he wept in secret, and uttered loud and passionate
complaints. His body had become emaciated; his eyes had
grown hollow and eager; he was pale and dejected, and in
every respect so much altered as scarcely to be known. His
beauty, his sprightliness, and his vigor had forsaken him. All
the grace and dignity of his deportment were lost, and life itself
suffered by a swift but silent decay.  As a flower that blooms

<!-- page 259 -->

in the morning, fills the air with fragrance, and then gradually
fades at the approach of night, loses the vivid brightness of
its colors, droops, withers, and at length falls with its own weight,
so the son of Ulysses was sinking insensibly into the grave.</p>

<p>Mentor, perceiving that Telemachus could not resist the violence
of his passion, had recourse to an artifice, which he
hoped might preserve him from its most pernicious effects. He
had remarked that Calypso was enamored of Telemachus, and
Telemachus of Eucharis; for, as Cupid is always busy to give
pain under the appearance of pleasure, it seldom happens that
we are loved by those whom we love. He therefore resolved
to make Calypso jealous. It having been agreed between
Eucharis and Telemachus that they should go out together a-hunting,
Mentor took that opportunity to alarm her. "I have
observed," said he, "that Telemachus has of late been more
fond of the chase than I ever knew before; he seems now to
take pleasure in nothing else, and is in love only with mountains
and forests. Is the chase also thy favorite pleasure, O
goddess? and has he caught this ardor from thee?"</p>

<p>Calypso was so stung by this question, that she could neither
dissemble her emotion nor hide the cause. "This Telemachus,"
said she, "whose heroic virtues despised the pleasures
that were offered him in the isle of Cyprus, has not been able
to withstand the charms of one of my nymphs, who is not
remarkable for beauty. How did he dare to boast of having
achieved so many wonders?&mdash;he, whom luxury has rendered
sordid and effeminate, and who seems to have been intended by
nature only for a life of indolence and obscurity among
women!" Mentor observed with pleasure that Calypso suffered
great anguish from her jealousy, and therefore said
nothing more to inflame it at that time, lest she should suspect
his design; but he assumed a look that expressed dejection and
concern. The goddess manifested, without reserve, her uneasiness
at all she saw, and incessantly entertained him with new
complaints. The hunting-match, to which Mentor had called
her attention, exasperated her beyond all bounds. She knew
that Telemachus had nothing in view but to draw Eucharis

<!-- page 260 -->

from the rest of the nymphs, that he might speak to her in
private. A second hunting-match was proposed soon afterwards,
and Calypso knew that it was intended for the same
purpose as the first. In order to disconcert the plans of Telemachus,
she declared she would be of the party. But, her
emotion being too violent to be concealed, she suddenly broke
out into this reproachful expostulation:</p>

<p>"Is it thus, then, presumptuous boy, that thou hast made
my dominions an asylum from the resentment of Neptune and
the righteous vengeance of the gods? Hast thou entered this
island, which mortals are forbidden to approach, only to defy
my power and despise my love? Hear me, ye gods of the
celestial and infernal world, let the sufferings of an injured
deity awaken your vengeance! Overtake this perfidious, this
ungrateful, this impious mortal, with swift destruction! Since
thy obduracy and injustice are greater than thy father's, may
thy sufferings also be longer and more severe! May thy country
be forever hidden from thy eyes,&mdash;that wretched, that despicable
country, which, in the folly of thy presumption, thou
hast, without a blush, preferred to immortality with me! or
rather, mayst thou perish, when in the distant horizon it first
rises before thee! mayst thou then, plunged in the deep, be
driven back, the sport of the waves, and cast lifeless upon these
sands, which shall deny thee burial! May my eyes see the
vultures devour thee!&mdash;they shall see them, and she whom
thou lovest shall see them also; she shall see them with despair
and anguish, and her misery shall be my delight!"</p>

<p>While Calypso was thus speaking, her whole countenance
was suffused with rage: there was a gloomy fierceness in her
looks, which continually hurried from one object to another.
Her lips trembled, a livid circle surrounded them; and her color,
which was sometimes pale as death, changed every moment.
Her tears, which she had been used to shed in great plenty,
now ceased to flow, as if despair and rage had dried up their
source;<sup id="t_ref101"><a href="#t_en101">101</a></sup> and her voice was hoarse, tremulous, and interrupted.</p>

<!-- page 261 -->

<p>Mentor remarked all the changes of her emotions, but said
nothing more to Telemachus. He treated him as a man infected
with an incurable disease, to whom it was in vain to
administer remedies; but he frequently regarded him with a
look that strongly expressed his compassion.</p>

<p>Telemachus was sensible of his weakness, and conscious that
he was unworthy of the friendship of Mentor. He kept his
eyes fixed upon the ground, not daring to look up, lest he
should meet those of his monitor, by whose very silence he
was condemned. He was often ready to throw himself upon
his neck, and at once confess and renounce his folly; but he
was sometimes restrained by a false shame, and sometimes by
a consciousness that his profession would not be sincere, and
by a secret fondness for a situation which, though he knew it
to be dangerous, was yet so pleasing, that he could not resolve
to quit it.</p>

<p>In the mean time the deities of Olympus kept their eyes
fixed, in silent suspense, upon the island of Calypso, to see the
issue of this contest between Venus and Minerva. Cupid, who
like a playful child had been caressed by all the nymphs in
their turns, had set every breast on fire. Minerva, under the
form of Mentor, had availed herself of that jealousy which is
inseparable from love, to preclude its effects; and Jupiter resolved
to sit neuter between them.</p>

<p>Eucharis, who feared that Telemachus might escape from
her chains, practised a thousand arts to detain him. She was
now ready to go out with him to the second chase, as had
been agreed upon between them, and had dressed herself like
Diana. The deities of love and beauty had, by a mutual effort,
improved her charms, which were now superior even to
those of Calypso. Calypso beheld her at a distance; and, seeing
her own reflection also in a fountain near which she stood,
the comparison filled her with grief and shame.  She hid herself

<!-- page 262 -->

in the innermost recess of her grotto, and gave herself up
to these reflections:</p>

<p>"I have then vainly endeavored to interrupt the pleasure of
these lovers, by declaring that I will go with them to the chase.
Shall I still go? Alas! shall I be a foil to her beauties? shall
I increase her triumph and his passion? Wretch that I am!
what have I done? I will not go, nor shall they: I know
well how to prevent them. If I entreat Mentor to quit the
island with his friend, he will immediately conduct him to
Ithaca. But what do I say? When Telemachus is gone,
what will become of Calypso?  Where am I? what shall I do?
O cruel Venus! O Venus, thou hast deceived me! thou hast
betrayed me with a fatal gift! Pernicious boy! I opened my
heart to thee, seduced by the pleasing hope that thou wouldst
introduce felicity; but thou hast perfidiously filled it with
anguish and despair. My nymphs have combined against me,
and my divinity serves only to perpetuate my sufferings. Oh
that I could put an end to my being and my sufferings together!
But I cannot die, and therefore, Telemachus, thou
shalt not live. I will revenge myself of thy ingratitude; thy
nymph shall be the witness of thy punishment: in her presence
will I strike thee to the heart. But I rave. O unhappy
Calypso, what wouldst thou do? Wouldst thou destroy the
guiltless youth whom thou hast already made wretched? It is
I that have kindled, in the chaste bosom of Telemachus, a
guilty flame. How pure was his innocence, and how uniform
his virtue! how noble his detestation of vice, how heroic his
disdain of inglorious pleasure! Why did I taint so immaculate
a breast? He would have left me, alas! And must he
not leave me now? or, since he lives but for my rival, if he
stays, must he not stay only to despise me? But I have merited
the misery that I suffer. Go then, Telemachus; again let
the seas divide us: go, and leave Calypso without consolation,
unable to sustain the burden of life,&mdash;unable to lay it down in
the grave. Leave me, without consolation, overwhelmed with
shame, and despoiled of hope, the victim of remorse, and the
scorn of Eucharis."</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>Thus she spoke alone in the obscurity of her grotto; but,
the next moment, starting suddenly from her seat, she ran out
with a furious impetuosity, and cried out: "Where art thou,
Mentor? Is it thus that thy wisdom sustains Telemachus
against the mischief that is even now ready to overwhelm
him? Thou sleepest while love is vigilant against thee. I can
bear this slothful indifference no longer. Wilt thou always
see the son of Ulysses dishonor his birth, and forego the
advantages of his fortune, with this negligent tranquillity?
It is to thy care, and not mine, that his friends have committed
him; wilt thou, then, sit idle while I am busy for his preservation?
The remotest part of this forest abounds in tall poplars,
of which a commodious vessel may easily be built; in that
place Ulysses himself built the vessel in which he set sail from
this island. In that place you will find a deep cave, which
contains all the implements that are necessary for the work."</p>

<p>She had no sooner given Mentor this intelligence than she
repented of it; but he lost not a moment to improve it. He
hastened immediately to the cave, found the implements, felled
the trees, and in one day constructed a vessel fit for the sea;
for, to Minerva, a short time was sufficient for a great work.</p>

<p>Calypso, in the mean time, suffered the most tormenting
anxiety and suspense. She was impatient to know what
Mentor would do in consequence of her information, and
unable to bear the thought of leaving Telemachus and Eucharis
at full liberty, by quitting the chase. Her jealousy would not
permit her to lose sight of the lovers, and therefore she contrived
to lead the hunters towards that part of the forest where
she supposed Mentor would be at work. She soon thought
she heard the strokes of the axe and the mallet; she listened,
and every blow that she heard made her tremble; yet she was
distracted in the very moment of attention by her fears, that
some amorous intimation, some sigh or some glance, between
Telemachus and Eucharis, might escape her notice.</p>

<p>Eucharis, at the same time, thought fit to rally her lover.
"Are you not afraid," said she, "that Mentor will chide you
for going to the chase without him?  What a pity it is that

<!-- page 264 -->

you have so severe a master! He has an austerity that
nothing can soften; he affects to despise pleasure himself and
therefore interdicts it to you, not excepting the most innocent
amusements. It might, indeed, be proper for you to submit to
his direction before you were able to govern yourself; but after
you have given such proofs of wisdom, you ought no longer to
suffer yourself to be treated like a child."</p>

<p>This subtle reproach stung Telemachus to the heart: he felt
a secret indignation against Mentor, and an impatient desire to
throw off his yoke, yet he was still afraid to see him; and his
mind was in such agitation that he made the nymph no reply.
The hunt, during which all parties had felt equal constraint
and uneasiness, being now over, they returned home by that
part of the forest where Mentor had been all day at work.
Calypso saw the vessel finished at a distance: a thick cloud,
like the shades of death, fell instantly upon her eyes. Her
knees trembled, she was covered with a cold sweat,<sup id="t_ref102"><a href="#t_en102">102</a></sup> and
obliged to support herself by leaning on the nymphs that surrounded
her; among whom Eucharis pressing to assist her,
she pushed her back with a frown of indignation and disdain.</p>

<p>Telemachus, who saw the vessel, but not Mentor, who had
finished his work, and had retired, asked Calypso to whom it
belonged, and for what purpose it was intended? She could not
answer him immediately; but at length she told him it was to
send away Mentor, whom she had directed to build it for that
purpose. "You," said she, "shall be no longer distressed by
the austerity of that severe censor, who opposes your happiness,
and would become jealous of your immortality."</p>

<p>"To send away Mentor!" said Telemachus. "If he forsakes
me I am undone; if he forsakes me, whom shall I have left,
Eucharis, but thee?" Thus, in the unguarded moment of surprise
and love, the secret escaped him in words, which his
heart prompted, and of which he did not consider the import.
He discovered his indiscretion the moment it was too late; the
whole company was struck dumb with confusion; Eucharis

<!-- page 265 -->

blushed, and, fixing her eyes upon the ground, stood behind
the crowd, not daring to appear. But, though shame glowed
upon her cheek, joy revelled at her heart. Telemachus so far
lost his recollection that he scarcely knew what he had done:
the whole appeared to him like a dream, but it was like a
dream of confusion and trouble.</p>

<p>Calypso instantly quitted the place; and, transported with
rage, made her way through the forest with a hasty and disordered
pace, following no track, and not knowing whither she
was going. At length, however, she found herself at the entrance
of her grotto, where Mentor was waiting her return.
"Begone," said she, "from this island, O stranger, who art
come hither only to interrupt my peace! Begone, thou hoary
dotard, with that infatuated boy, and be assured that, if he
is found another hour within my dominions, thou shalt know
the power of a deity to punish. I will see him no more, nor
will I suffer my nymphs to have any further intercourse with
him. This I swear by the waters of the Styx, an oath at
which the inhabitants of eternity tremble.<sup id="t_ref103"><a href="#t_en103">103</a></sup> But thou, Telemachus,
shalt know that thy sufferings are yet but begun. I
dismiss thee from this island, but it is only to new misfortunes;
I will be revenged, and thou shalt regret the abuse of my
bounty in vain. Neptune still resents the injury which he
received from thy father in Sicily,<sup id="t_ref104"><a href="#t_en104">104</a></sup> and solicited by Venus,
whose worship thou hast since despised in the isle of Cyprus,
he is now preparing to excite new tempests against thee. Thou
shalt see thy father, who is not dead; but, when thou seest
him, thou shalt not know him. Thou shalt meet him in
Ithaca, but thou shalt first suffer the severest persecutions of
fortune. Begone! I conjure the celestial deities to revenge me!
Mayst thou be suspended in the middle of the deep, by the
crag of some solitary and naked rock: there may the thunder

<!-- page 266 -->

strike thee from above; and there mayst thou invoke Calypso,
who shall scorn thy repentance and enjoy<sup id="t_ref105"><a href="#t_en105">105</a></sup> thy punishment."</p>

<p>But the rage of Calypso evaporated with the very breath
that expressed it, and the desire of retaining Telemachus revived
in her bosom. "Let him live," said she to herself, "and
let him live here; perhaps in time he will learn to set a just
value upon my friendship, and reflect that Eucharis has no
immortality to bestow. But, alas! I have ensnared myself by
an inviolable oath; it has bound me with everlasting bonds,
and the waters of the Styx, by which I have sworn, preclude
forever the return of hope." While these thoughts passed
silently in her bosom, all the furies were painted upon her
countenance, and all the pestilential vapors of Cocytus seemed
to exhale from her heart.</p>

<p>Her whole appearance struck Telemachus with horror. She
instantly perceived it,&mdash;for what is hidden<sup id="t_ref106"><a href="#t_en106">106</a></sup> from the perspicacity
of love?&mdash;and the discovery added new violence to her phrensy.
She suddenly started away from the place where she stood, with
all the fury that inspires the votaries of Bacchus<sup id="t_ref107"><a href="#t_en107">107</a></sup> when their
shouts echo from the mountains of Thrace; she rushed
into the woods with a javelin in her hand, calling all her
nymphs to follow her, and threatening to pierce those who
should stay behind. Terrified at this menace they thronged
round her, and Eucharis among the rest, her eyes swimming
in tears, and her last look directed to Telemachus, to whom
she did not dare to speak. The goddess trembled when she
approached her, and was so far from being softened by her
submission, that she burned with new rage when she perceived
that affliction itself only heightened her beauty.<sup id="t_ref108"><a href="#t_en108">108</a></sup></p>

<!-- page 267 -->

<p>Telemachus was now left alone with Mentor. After a short
interval of silence and confusion, he threw himself on the
ground, and embraced his knees: he did not dare to throw himself
on his neck, or even to lift up his eyes upon him. He burst
into tears: he attempted to speak, but his voice failed him,
and he was yet more at a loss for words: he knew not what
he ought to do, what he did, or what he would do; but at
length he cried out: "O more than father! O Mentor! deliver
me from the evils that surround me. I can neither forsake nor
follow you: deliver me from evils that are worse than death;
deliver me from myself; put an end to my being!"</p>

<p>Mentor embraced him, comforted and encouraged him; and,
without soothing his passion, reconciled him to life. "O son
of the wise Ulysses," said he, "whom the gods have so highly
favored, and whom they favor still, the very sufferings of which
thou art now complaining are new testimonies of their love.
He who has never felt the strength of his passions, and his own
weakness, is not yet acquainted with wisdom; he is not yet
acquainted with himself; nor is he aware how little his own
heart is to be trusted. The gods have led thee, as it were,
by the hand, to the brink of destruction; they have showed
thee the depth of the abyss, but they have not suffered thee
to fall in. Secure now the knowledge which otherwise thou
couldst never have acquired. Improve that experience, without
which it would have been in vain to tell thee of the
treachery of Love, who flatters only to destroy, and who conceals
the keenest anguish under the appearance of delight.
Thou hast now seen and known this lovely, this perfidious boy.
He came hither blooming in immortal beauty, and all was
mirth and sport, elegance and dissipation. He stole away thy
heart, and thou hadst pleasure in permitting the theft; yet
didst thou wish to persuade thyself that it was still thy own.
Thou wast solicitous to deceive me and to flatter thyself, and
thou art now gathering the fruits of thy indiscretion. Thou
art importuning me to take away thy life, and that I will
comply is the only hope that lingers in thy breast. The goddess
is transformed, by the violence of her passions, to an infernal

<!-- page 268 -->

fury. Eucharis is tormented by a flame less tolerable
than the pains of death, and among the nymphs of Calypso,
Jealousy has scattered her plagues with an unsparing hand.
Such are the exploits of that boy, whose appearance was so
gentle and lovely. How greatly, then, art thou beloved by
the gods, who have opened a way for thee to fly from him,
and return to thy country, the object not only of a blameless,
but a noble passion. Calypso is herself compelled to drive
thee hence. The vessel is ready; call up, then all thy courage,
and let us make haste to quit this island, where it is certain
that virtue can never dwell."</p>

<p>Mentor, while he was yet speaking, took Telemachus by the
hand and led him towards the shore. Telemachus consented
with silent reluctance, and looked behind him at every step.
Eucharis was still in sight, though at a considerable distance.
Not being able to see her face, he gazed at her fine hair, which,
tied in a lock, played gracefully behind her, and at her loose
light robe that flowed negligently in the wind. He remarked
the easy majesty of her gait, and could have kissed the mark
of her footsteps on the ground. When his eye could no longer
reach her, he listened, and he persuaded himself that he heard
her voice. He still saw her though she was absent:<sup id="t_ref109"><a href="#t_en109">109</a></sup> his fancy
realized her image;<sup id="t_ref110"><a href="#t_en110">110</a></sup> and he thought that he was talking with
her, not knowing where he was, nor hearing any thing that was
said by Mentor.</p>

<p>But, at length, awaking as from a dream, he said: "Mentor,
I am resolved to follow you; but I have not yet taken leave of
Eucharis. I would rather perish than abandon her thus with
ingratitude. Stay only till I see her once more; stay only till
I bid her farewell forever. Let me tell her that the gods,
jealous of my felicity, compel me to depart; but that they
shall sooner put an end to my life than blot her from my
remembrance.  O my father, grant me this last, this most

<!-- page 269 -->

reasonable request; or destroy me this moment, and let me
die at your feet. I have no desire to continue in this island;
nor will I give up my heart to love. Love is, indeed, a stranger
to my heart; for all that I feel for Eucharis amounts but
to friendship and gratitude. I desire only to bid her farewell,
and I will then follow you without a moment's delay."</p>

<p>"My son," replied Mentor, "my pity for you is more than I
can express. Your passion is so violent that you are not conscious
it possesses you. You imagine yourself to be in a state of
tranquillity, even while you are abjuring me to take away your
life. You declare that you are not under the influence of love,
while you feel yourself unable to quit the object of your passion&mdash;while
you see and hear her only, and are blind and deaf
to all besides. So the man whom a fever has rendered delirious
tells you he is not sick. Your understanding is blinded
by desire: you are ready to renounce Penelope, who expects
you in Ithaca; and Ulysses, whom you shall certainly see
again at your return, and to whose throne you are to succeed.
You would give up all the glory which the gods have promised,
and confirmed by the miracles which they have wrought
in your behalf, to live with Eucharis in obscurity and disgrace;
and yet you pretend that your attachment to her is not the
effect of love. What is it but love that troubles you? what
but love has made you weary of life? and what else produced
the transport that betrayed your secret to Calypso? I do not
accuse you of insincerity, but I pity your delusion. Fly, fly,
O Telemachus, for love is conquered only by flight. Against
such an enemy, true courage consists in fear and retreat&mdash;in
retreat without deliberation, and without looking back. You
cannot have forgotten the tender anxieties you have cost me
from your earliest infancy, nor the dangers which my counsel
has enabled you to avoid; why, then, will you distrust me
now? Believe me, or let me leave you to your fate. You
know not the anguish that my heart has felt to see you rush
forward in the path of destruction; you know not what I
secretly suffered when I did not dare to speak to you: your
mother felt not a severer pang at your birth.  I was silent,

<!-- page 270 -->

and suppressed even my sighs, in the fond hope that you
would at length return to me without admonition or reproof.
O my son, restore to me that which is dearer than life&mdash;give
me thyself, and be once more mine and thy own. If reason
shall at length prevail over passion, I shall live, and my life
shall be happy; but if, in the contest with passion, reason
shall give way, my happiness is at an end, and I can live no
longer."</p>

<p>During this discourse. Mentor continued to advance towards
the sea; and Telemachus, who had not yet sufficient resolution
to follow him, was already so far influenced as to suffer himself
to be led forward without resistance. Minerva, in this crisis
of his fate, still concealed under the form of Mentor, covered
him invisibly with her shield, and diffused round him the divine
radiance of uncreated light: its influence was immediate
and irresistible; and Telemachus was conscious of a strength
of mind which, since his arrival in the island of Calypso, he
had never felt. They came at length to the sea-shore, which
in that place was steep and rocky&mdash;a lofty cliff, ever beaten by
the foaming surge below. From this promontory they looked
to see whether the ship which had been built by Mentor was
still in the place where they had left it, and they beheld a
scene which, to Mentor at least, was extremely mortifying and
distressful.</p>

<p>Love, who was conscious that his shafts could make no impression
upon Mentor, now saw him carry off Telemachus with
new pangs of disappointed malignity. He wept with rage and
vexation, and went in search of Calypso, who was wandering
about in the most gloomy recesses of the forest. The moment
she saw him, a deep sigh escaped her, and she felt every wound
in her bosom begin to bleed afresh. "Art thou a goddess,"
said the disdainful boy, "and dost thou suffer thyself to be
denied by a feeble mortal who is captive in thy dominions?
Why is he suffered to depart with impunity?" "O fatal
power," replied Calypso, "let me no more listen to thy dangerous
counsel, which has already seduced me from a state of
perfect and delicious tranquillity, and plunged me into an

<!-- page 271 -->

abyss of misery. All counsel is, indeed, too late: I have
sworn, by the waters of the Styx, that I will not detain him.
This awful oath Jupiter himself, the father of the gods, omnipotent
and eternal, does not dare to violate. Depart, then,
Telemachus, from this island; depart thou also, pernicious
boy, for my misfortunes are derived rather from thee than
from him."</p>

<p>Love, drying up his tears, replied with a smile of derision
and disdain: "And this oath has left you without an expedient!
Leave the matter, then, to my management. As you
have sworn to let Telemachus depart, take no measures to detain
him; but neither I nor your nymphs are bound by your
oath. I will incite them to burn the vessel that Mentor has
so hastily built; and his diligence to circumvent us shall be
ineffectual. He also shall be circumvented in his turn, and
find himself unexpectedly deprived of all means to rescue
Telemachus from your power."</p>

<p>The voice of Love thus soothed the despair of Calypso, as
the breath of the zephyrs, upon the margin of a stream, refreshes
the languid flock which are fainting in the burning
heat of a summer's sun. The sweet influence of hope and joy
was again felt in her breast; her countenance became serene,
and her eyes soft and placid; the glooms of care were dissipated
for a moment; she stopped, she smiled; and she repaid
the flattery of the wanton boy with caresses, which prepared
new anguish for her heart.</p>

<p>Cupid, pleased with having persuaded Calypso, went to try
his influence upon her nymphs. They were scattered about
upon the mountains like a flock of sheep, which, pursued by
some hungry wolf, have fled far from the shepherd. Love
collects them, and says: "Telemachus is still in your hands;
but if a moment is lost, he will escape you. Make haste, then,
and set fire to the vessel which Mentor in his temerity has
constructed to carry him off." Torches were lighted in a moment;
they rushed towards the sea-shore, with the cries and
gestures of frantic Bacchanals; their hair dishevelled, and their
limbs trembling. The flames spread; the whole vessel was soon

<!-- page 272 -->

in a blaze; and the smoke, intermixed with sheets of fire, rose
in a cloudy volume to the sky.<sup id="t_ref111"><a href="#t_en111">111</a></sup></p>

<p>Telemachus and Mentor saw the flames, and heard the cries
of the nymphs from the top of the rocks. Telemachus was
secretly inclined to rejoice at what had happened; the health
of his mind was not yet perfectly restored; and Mentor remarked
that his passion was like a fire not totally extinguished,
which, from time to time, gleams from the embers, and frequently
throws out sparks with a sudden and unexpected vigor.
"Now," said Telemachus, "our retreat is cut off, and our
escape from the island is impossible."</p>

<p>Mentor, who perceived that he was relapsing into all his
follies, knew that not a moment was to be lost. He saw a
vessel laying at anchor in the distance, which did not approach
the shore, because it was well known to all pilots that the
island of Calypso was inaccessible. This wise guardian of inexperienced
youth, therefore, suddenly pushed Telemachus
from the top of the rock into the sea, and instantly leaped after
him. Telemachus, who was at first stunned by the fall, drank
of the briny wave and became the sport of the surge. But, at
length, recovering from his astonishment, and seeing Mentor,
who had stretched out his hand to assist him in swimming, he
thought only how to leave the island at a distance.</p>

<p>The nymphs, who before imagined that they had secured
their captives, uttered a dreadful cry when they saw them
escape. Calypso, again overwhelmed with despair, retired to
her grotto, which she filled with unavailing complaints. Love,
who saw his triumph suddenly changed into a defeat, sprung
up into the air, and, spreading his wings, took his flight to the
groves of Idalia, where he was expected by Venus. The boy,
still more cruel than his mother, consoled himself for his disappointment
by laughing, with her, at the mischief they had
done.</p>

<p>Telemachus felt, with pleasure, that his fortitude and his

<!-- page 273 -->

love of virtue revived as his distance from the fatal island of
Calypso increased. "I now," said he to Mentor, "experience
what you have told me,&mdash;what, without experience, I could
never have believed: 'Vice can only be conquered by flight.'
My father, how dear a testimony have the gods given me of
their love, by granting me the guidance and protection of thy
wisdom! I deserved, indeed, to be deprived of both; I
deserved to be abandoned to my own folly. I now fear neither
seas nor winds; I apprehend danger only from my passions.
Love alone is more to be dreaded than all the calamities of
shipwreck."</p>

<hr/>

<h2 class="center" id="tb07">BOOK VII.</h2>

<p class="small">The vessel proves to be a Tyrian, commanded by Adoam, the brother of
Narbal, by whom the adventurers are kindly received. Adoam recollects
Telemachus, and relates the tragical death of Pygmalion and
Astarbe, and the accession of Baleazar, whom the tyrant his father had
disgraced at her instigation. During a banquet which he prepares for
his guests, Achitoas entertains them with music, which brings the Tritons,
the Nereids, and other divinities of the sea, in crowds around the
vessel. Mentor, taking up a lyre, plays much better than Achitoas.
Adoam relates the wonders of B&oelig;tica: he describes the soft temperature
of the air, and the beauties of the country, where the utmost simplicity
of manners secures to the people uninterrupted tranquillity.</p>

<p>THE vessel which lay at anchor, and which Telemachus and
Mentor were approaching, was of Ph&oelig;nicia, and bound to
Epirus.<sup id="t_ref112"><a href="#t_en112">112</a></sup> The Ph&oelig;nicians who were on board had seen Telemachus
in his voyage from Egypt, but he could not be
sufficiently distinguished to be known while he was swimming
in the sea. When Mentor was near enough the vessel to be
heard, he raised his head above the water and called out with
a loud voice: "Ph&oelig;nicians, you who succor alike the distressed
of all nations, refuse not your assistance to two strangers,
whose life depends upon your humanity. If you have any
reverence for the gods, take us on board, and we will accompany
you whithersoever you are bound." The commander of
the vessel immediately answered: "We will receive you with
joy; it is not necessary that you should be known to us; it
suffices that you are men, and in distress." He gave orders
accordingly, and they were taken into the ship.</p>

<p>When they first came aboard, they were so exhausted and

<!-- page 275 -->

out of breath that they could neither speak nor move, for
they had been swimming a long time, and struggling hard with
the billows. They recovered, however, by degrees, and had
change of apparel brought them, their own being heavy with
the water it had imbibed, which ran off from all parts. As
soon as they were able to speak, the Ph&oelig;nicians gathered
around them, and were impatient to hear their adventures,
"How," said the commander, "did you get into that island,
from which you have come? It is in the possession of a goddess,
who suffers no man to enter it; and, indeed, it is surrounded
by rocks, which are always beaten by so dreadful a
surge that it can scarcely be approached without certain shipwreck."
Mentor replied: "We were driven on shore by a
storm. We are Greeks from Ithaca, an island not far from
Epirus, whither you are bound. If you should not touch there,
which however is in your course, we shall be satisfied to be put
on shore at your port; for we shall find friends in Epirus, who
will procure us a passage to Ithaca; and we shall still think
ourselves indebted to your humanity, for the happiness of being
again restored to all that is dear to us in the world."</p>

<p>Telemachus remained silent, and left Mentor to answer for
them both, for the faults which he had committed in the
island of Calypso had greatly increased his prudence. He
was now diffident of himself; and, conscious how much he
always stood in need of the instructions of superior wisdom,
when he had no opportunity of asking Mentor's advice, he
watched his countenance, and endeavored to discover his sentiments
in his looks.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nician commander, observing the silence of Telemachus,
looked earnestly at him, and thought he remembered
to have seen him before; but, not being able to recollect any
particulars, "Permit me," said he, "to ask, if you have not
some remembrance of having seen me before, for I think this
is not the first time I have seen you: your countenance is well
known to me; it struck me at the first glance, but I cannot
recollect where we have met: perhaps my memory may be
assisted by yours."</p>

<!-- page 276 -->

<p>Telemachus immediately replied, with a mixture of surprise
and pleasure: "I have felt at the sight of you exactly what
you have felt at the sight of me. I well remember to have
seen you, but I cannot recollect whether in Egypt or at Tyre."
The Ph&oelig;nician, at the mention of Egypt and Tyre, like a man
who, waking in the morning, has brought back by degrees, and
as it were from a remote distance, the evanescent images of a
dream which had fled with the shadows of the night, suddenly
cried out: "Thou art Telemachus, with whom Narbal contracted
a friendship when we were returning from Egypt. I
am his brother, of whom you have doubtless heard him often
speak. I left you with him when we arrived at Tyre, being
myself obliged to make a voyage to B&oelig;tica,<sup id="t_ref113"><a href="#t_en113">113</a></sup> that celebrated
country, near the Pillars of Hercules. Having, therefore, but
just seen you, it is not strange that I did not perfectly recollect
you at first sight."</p>

<p>"I perceive," said Telemachus, "that you are Adoam. I
had no opportunity of a personal acquaintance with you, but I
have heard much of you from Narbal. How should I rejoice
to hear of him from you; for to me his memory will be forever
dear. Is he still at Tyre? has he suffered nothing from the
suspicion and cruelty of Pygmalion?" "Telemachus," said
Adoam, interrupting him, "fortune has now given you in
charge to a man who will, to the utmost of his abilities, deserve
the trust. I will put you on shore at Ithaca before I proceed
to Epirus, and you shall not find less friendship in the brother
of Narbal than in Narbal himself."</p>

<p>Having looked aloft while he was speaking, he observed
that the wind for which he had waited began to blow; he
therefore gave orders instantly to weigh anchor. The sails
were spread to the breeze, and the oars divided the flood.
Adoam then took Telemachus and Mentor apart to speak with
them.</p>

<p>"I will now," said he to Telemachus, "gratify your curiosity.

<!-- page 277 -->

The tyranny of Pygmalion is at an end; from that
scourge the righteous gods have delivered the earth. As he
dared to trust no man, so no man dared to trust him. The
good were content to sigh in secret, and to hide themselves
from his cruelty, without attempting any thing against him;
the wicked thought there was no way of securing their own
lives but by putting an end to his. There was not a man in
Tyre who was not in perpetual danger of alarming his suspicion.
To this danger the guards themselves were more exposed
than others: as his life was in their hands, he feared them in
proportion to their power, and he sacrificed them to his safety
upon the slightest mistrust. Thus, his very search of security
rendered the finding of it impossible. Those in whose hands
he had deposited his life, were themselves in perpetual danger
by his suspicion; and the only expedient to deliver themselves
from this dreadful situation, was to anticipate the effects of his
suspicion by his death.</p>

<p>"The first, however, who took a resolution to destroy him,
was the impious Astarbe, whom you have heard so often mentioned
already. She was passionately enamored of a rich
young Tyrian, whose name was Joazar, and had conceived a
design of placing him upon the throne. To facilitate the execution
of this project, she persuaded the king that Phadael,
the eldest of his two sons, being impatient to succeed him, had
conspired against his life. She suborned witnesses to support
the charge, and the unhappy tyrant caused Phadael to be put
to death. Baleazar, his second son, was sent to Samos, under
pretence of learning the manners and the sciences of Greece
but, in reality, because Astarbe had persuaded the king that it
was necessary to send him away, lest he should associate himself
with the malcontents. The ship in which he embarked
had scarcely quitted the port, when those who had been appointed
to navigate it having been corrupted by the perfidious
inhumanity of Astarbe, contrived to make a shipwreck of the
vessel in the night. Having thrown the young prince into the
sea, they preserved themselves by swimming to some foreign
barks that waited for them at a convenient distance.</p>

<!-- page 278 -->

<p>"In the mean time, the amours of Astarbe were secrets to
none but Pygmalion, who fondly imagined himself to be the
only object of her affection. He who heard even the whispers
of the breeze with distrust and dread, relied on this abandoned
woman with a blind and implicit confidence. At the time,
however, when love rendered him the dupe of her artifices, he
was incited by avarice to find some pretence for putting Joazar,
her favorite, to death, that he might seize upon his riches.</p>

<p>"But while suspicion, love, and avarice were thus sharing
the heart of Pygmalion, Astarbe was contriving his immediate
destruction. She thought it possible that he might have discovered
something of her connection with Joazar, and if not,
she knew that avarice alone would furnish him with a sufficient
motive to cut him off. She concluded, therefore, that not a
moment was to be lost. She saw that all the principal officers
of the court were ready to dip their hands in his blood, and
she heard of some new conspiracy every day. Yet there was
none whom she could make the confidant of her design, without
putting her own life in his power. She therefore determined
to destroy Pygmalion by poison, and to administer it
herself.</p>

<p>"It was his general practice to eat with her in private; and
he always dressed his food himself, not daring to trust any
hand but his own. While he was thus employed, he used to
lock himself up in the most retired part of his palace, the
better to conceal his fears and elude observation. He did not
dare to enjoy any of the pleasures of the table, nor even to
taste any thing which had not been prepared wholly by himself.
He was thus precluded from the use, not only of delicacies
and refinements in cookery, but of wine, bread, salt, oil,
milk, and all other ordinary food. He lived entirely upon
fruit, which he gathered himself from his garden, or such
roots and herbs as he had sowed and dressed with his own
hands. He drank no liquor but the water which he drew from
a fountain that was inclosed in a part of the palace, of which
he always kept the key. Notwithstanding his confidence in
Astarbe, he did not, in this particular, lay aside his precaution

<!-- page 279 -->

even with respect to her. He made her eat and drink of
every thing that constituted their repast before he tasted it
himself, that he might be sure not to be poisoned without her,
and that she might have no hope of surviving him. She contrived,
however, to render this precaution ineffectual; for she
took a counter-poison, which she had obtained of an old woman
yet more wicked than herself, whom upon this occasion she
made no scruple to trust, as she was already the confidante of
her amours. As she was thus secured against danger in
poisoning the king with food, of which she was herself to
partake, she accomplished her purpose in the following manner:</p>

<p>"At the moment when they were sitting down to their
repast, the old woman made a noise at one of the doors of the
apartment. The king, always fearing assassination, was greatly
alarmed, and ran in haste to the door to see that it was
secured. The old woman, having performed her part, withdrew.
The king stood torpid in suspense, not knowing what
to think of the noise he had heard, nor daring to resolve his
doubts by opening the door. Astarbe encouraged him,
caressed him, and pressed him to eat, having thrown poison
into his golden cup while he ran to the door upon the alarm,
Pygmalion, with his usual precaution, gave the cup first into
her hand; and she drank without fear, confiding in the antidote
she had taken. Pygmalion then drank himself and in a
short time afterwards sunk down in a state of total insensibility.</p>

<p>"Astarbe, who knew that he was capable of stabbing her to
the heart upon the slightest suspicion, and that he might
recover from this fit while he had yet strength to do it, immediately
rent her clothes, tore her hair, and burst into clamorous
lamentations. She took the dying king in her arms,
pressed him to her bosom, and shed over him a flood of tears,
which she had always at command. But when she saw that
his strength was just exhausted, and the last agony coming on,
she dropped the mask, and to prevent the possibility of his
recovery, threw herself upon him and smothered him.  She

<!-- page 280 -->

then took the royal signet from his finger, and the diadem from
his head, and presented them both to Joazar, whom she called
in for that purpose. She imagined that all her partisans
would readily concur in the gratification of her passion, and
that her lover would not fail to be proclaimed king. But those
who had paid their court to her with the greatest assiduity,
were base and mercenary wretches, who were incapable of a
sincere affection, and, besides being destitute of courage, were
deterred from supporting Astarbe by fear of her enemies. Her
own pride, dissimulation, and cruelty were yet more formidable;
and every one wished that she might perish, as a pledge
of his own security.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, the palace was in the utmost confusion;
nothing was heard but a repetition of the words, 'The king
is dead!' Some stood terrified and irresolute; others ran to
arms; every one rejoiced at the event, but every one apprehended
the consequences. The news presently circulated,
from mouth to mouth, through the whole city, where there
was not so much as a single person that regretted the death of
the king, which was a universal deliverance and consolation.</p>

<p>"Narbal, struck with an event so sudden and awful, compassionated
the misfortunes of Pygmalion, though he could
not but detest his vices. He regretted, like an honest man,
his having betrayed himself to destruction by an unlimited
and unreserved confidence in Astarbe; choosing rather to be
a tyrant, disclaimed by nature and abhorred by mankind,
than to fulfil the duties of a sovereign and become the father
of his people. He was also attentive to the interests of the
State, and made haste to assemble the friends of their country
to oppose the measures of Astarbe, under whose influence
there was the greatest reason to apprehend a reign yet more
oppressive than that of Pygmalion himself.</p>

<p>"Narbal knew that Baleazar was not drowned when he was
thrown into the sea, though the wretches who assured Astarbe
of his death thought otherwise. He saved himself, under
favor of the night, by swimming; and some Cretan merchants,
touched with compassion, took him into their vessel.  Having

<!-- page 281 -->

no reason to doubt that his destruction was intended, and
being equally afraid of the cruel jealousy of Pygmalion and
the fatal artifices of Astarbe, he did not dare to return into his
father's dominions. He wandered about for a long time on
the coast of Syria, where he had been left by the Cretans who
took him up, and gained a scanty subsistence by tending a
flock of sheep. At length, however, he found means to make
Narbal acquainted with his situation, not doubting that he
might safely trust his secret and his life with a man whose
virtue had been so often tried. Narbal, though he had been
ill-treated by the father, did not look with less tenderness upon
the son. Nor was he less attentive to his interests, in which,
however, his principal view was to prevent his undertaking any
thing inconsistent with the duty he still owed to his father,
and therefore he exerted all his influence to reconcile him to
his ill fortune.</p>

<p>"Baleazar had requested Narbal to send him a ring as a
token, whenever it should be proper for him to repair to Tyre;
but Narbal did not think it prudent during the life of Pygmalion,
as it would have been attended with the utmost danger
to them both. The tyrant's inquisitive circumspection was
such that no subtlety or diligence could elude it; but as soon
as the fate he merited had overtaken him, Narbal sent the
ring to Baleazar. Baleazar set out immediately, and arrived
at the gates of Tyre while the whole city was in the utmost
trouble and perplexity to know who should succeed to the
throne. He was at once known and acknowledged, as well
by the principal Tyrians as by the people. They loved him,
not for the sake of his father, who was the object of universal
detestation, but for his own amiable and gracious disposition.
Even his misfortunes now threw a kind of splendor around
him, which showed his good qualities to the greatest advantage,
and produced a tender interest in his favor.</p>

<p>"Narbal assembled the chiefs of the people, the elders of
the council, and the priests of the great goddess of Ph&oelig;nicia.
They saluted Baleazar as their king; and he was immediately
proclaimed by the heralds, amid the acclamations of the

<!-- page 282 -->

people. The shouts were heard by Astarbe in one of the
innermost recesses of the palace, where she had shut herself
up with Joazar, her effeminate and infamous favorite. She
was abandoned by all the sycophants and parasites, the corrupt
prostitutes of power, who had attached themselves to her
during the life of Pygmalion; for the wicked fear the wicked;
they know them to be unworthy of confidence, and therefore
do not wish they should be invested with authority. Men of
corrupt principles know how much others, of the same character,
abuse authority, and to what excess they carry oppression.
They wish rather to have the good set over them; for, though
they cannot hope for reward, they know that they shall not
suffer injury. Astarbe, therefore, was deserted by all but a
few wretches, who had so far involved themselves in her guilt,
that, whatever party they should espouse, they could not hope
to escape punishment.</p>

<p>"The palace was soon forced. The guilty, naturally irresolute
and timid, made little resistance, and endeavored to save
themselves by flight. Astarbe tried to make her escape disguised
like a slave, but she was recognized and seized by a
soldier. It was with great difficulty that the people were prevented
from tearing her to pieces. They had already thrown
her down, and were dragging her along the pavement, when
Narbal rescued her out of their hands. She then entreated
that she might speak to Baleazar, whom she hoped to influence
by her beauty, and to impose upon by pretending that she
could make important discoveries. Baleazar could not refuse
to hear her. She approached him with an expression of sweetness
and modesty in her countenance, which gave new power
to her beauty, and might have softened rage into pity and complacency.
She addressed him with the most delicate and insinuating
flattery; she conjured him, by the ashes of his father,
to take pity upon her, whom he had so tenderly loved; she
invoked the gods, as if she had paid them the homage of sincere
adoration; she shed a flood of tears, and, prostrating
herself on the ground before the young king, she passionately
embraced his knees. But as soon as she imagined these arts

<!-- page 283 -->

had gained an influence over him, she neglected nothing to
render him suspicious of the most faithful and affectionate of
his servants. She accused Narbal of having entered into a
conspiracy against Pygmalion, and of intrigues to get himself
chosen king instead of Baleazar, whom she insinuated he had
intended to poison. In the same manner she calumniated
every other person whom she knew to be a friend to virtue.
She hoped to find Baleazar susceptible of the same distrust and
suspicion as his father, but the young prince, discerning and
disdaining both her subtlety and her malice, suddenly interrupted
her by calling for his guards. She was immediately
carried to prison, and a proper number of persons, distinguished
for their experience and their wisdom, were appointed to
inquire into her conduct.</p>

<p>"They discovered, with horror, that she had first poisoned,
and then smothered Pygmalion, and that her whole life had
been one uninterrupted series of the most enormous crimes.
She was, therefore, judged worthy of the severest punishment
which the laws of Ph&oelig;nicia could inflict, and condemned to
be burnt by a slow fire. But as soon as she found that her
crimes were known, and her judges inexorable, she gave way
to all the furies that had taken possession of her soul. She
immediately swallowed poison, which she had taken care to
conceal about her, as the means of a speedy death, if she
should be condemned to suffer lingering torments. Those who
were about her soon perceived that she suffered intolerable
pain, and offered such relief as was in their power; but, without
giving any answer, she made signs that she would receive
no assistance. They then spoke to her of the righteous gods,
whose anger she had provoked, but, instead of expressing contrition
or remorse, she looked upwards with a mixture of despite
and arrogance, as if she abhorred their attributes and
defied their vengeance.</p>

<p>Her dying aspect expressed only impiety and rage. Of that
beauty which had been fatal to so many, no remains were now
left; every grace had vanished; her eyes, upon which the
hand of death was already heavy, were turned hastily on every

<!-- page 284 -->

side, with a wild and unmeaning ferocity; her lips were convulsed,
her mouth open, and her whole countenance distorted;
a livid paleness succeeded, and her body became cold: yet
sometimes she started, as it were, back to life; but it was only
to express the pang that roused her by shrieks and groans. At
length, however, she expired, leaving those that stood around
her in a state of inexpressible fright and horror. Her guilty
soul, without doubt, descended to those mournful regions,
where the unrelenting daughters of Danaus are perpetually
employed in filling vessels that will not hold water&mdash;where
Ixion forever turns his wheel&mdash;where Tantalus, in vain, endeavors
to slake his everlasting thirst with the water that
eludes his lips&mdash;where Sisyphus, with unavailing labor, rolls up
the stone which eternally falls back&mdash;where Tityus feels the
vulture incessantly preying upon his liver, which, as fast as it
is devoured, is renewed.</p>

<p>"Baleazar expressed his gratitude to the gods for his deliverance
from this monster, by innumerable sacrifices. He began
his reign by a conduct altogether different from that of Pygmalion.
He applied himself, with great diligence, to revive
commerce, which had long languished by a gradual decline.
In matters of great importance he takes the advice of Narbal,
yet does not submit implicitly to his direction; for, in every
instance, he makes the administration of government his own
act, and takes cognizance of all things with his own eye. He
hears every one's opinion, and then determines according to
his own. He is, consequently, the idol of his people. By
possessing their affections, he is master of more wealth than
the cruel avarice of his father could ever hoard; for there is
not a man in his dominions that would not freely part with
his whole property, if, upon a pressing necessity, he should
require it of him. What he leaves his people, therefore, is
more effectually his own than it would be if he took it away.
All precautions for the security of his person are unnecessary
for he is continually surrounded with an impregnable defence&mdash;the
affection of the public. There is not a subject in his
kingdom that does not dread the loss of his prince as a

<!-- page 285 -->

calamity to himself, and who would not interpose between
him and danger at the hazard of his life. He is happy, and
all his people are happy with him. He is afraid of requiring
too much of them, and they are afraid of offering him too
little. His moderation leaves them in affluence, but this affluence
renders them neither intractable nor insolent; for they
are habitually industrious, addicted to commerce, and inflexible
in supporting the ancient purity of their laws. Ph&oelig;nicia
has now reached the summit of greatness and glory, and owes
all her prosperity to her young king.</p>

<p>"Narbal is his minister, the instrument of his virtue, and of
wisdom. O Telemachus, if he were now to see you, with
what joy he would load you with presents, and send you back
with magnificence to your own country! How would he
have rejoiced to have placed the son of Ulysses upon the
throne of Ithaca, to diffuse the same happiness through that
island which Baleazar dispenses at Tyre! And how happy
am I to render you this service in his stead!"</p>

<p>Telemachus, who had listened with great pleasure to the
relation of these events, and was yet more sensibly touched
with the tender and zealous friendship with which Adoam
had received him in his misfortunes, replied only by clasping
him to his breast in a transport of gratitude, affection, and
esteem. Adoam then inquired how he came on shore at the
island of Calypso; and Telemachus, in his turn, gave him the
history of his departure from Tyre, of his passage to the isle
of Cyprus, of the manner of his finding Mentor, of their voyage
to Crete, of the public games for the election of a king
after the flight of Idomeneus, of the resentment of Venus, of
their shipwreck, of the pleasure with which Calypso received
them, of her becoming jealous of Eucharis, and of his being
thrown into the sea by Mentor, upon his perceiving a Ph&oelig;nician
vessel at some distance from the coast.</p>

<p>Adoam then ordered a magnificent entertainment; and, as
further testimony of his joy, he improved it with all the pleasures
of which his situation would admit. During the repast,
which was served by young Ph&oelig;nicians, dressed in white garments

<!-- page 286 -->

and crowned with flowers, the place was perfumed by
burning the most odoriferous gums of the East; they were
entertained with the sound of the flute by musicians, to whom
the rowers had resigned their seats; and this melody was from
time to time interrupted by Achitoas, who accompanied his
lyre with his voice, in strains which were worthy to be heard
at the table of the gods, and to which even Apollo might have
listened with delight. The Tritons, Nereids, and all the deities
who rule the waters in subordination to the father of the deep,
and even all the monsters of those hoary regions unknown to
man, quitted the watery grottos of the abyss, and swam in
crowds around the vessel to enjoy the harmony. A band of
Ph&oelig;nician youths, of exquisite beauty, clothed in fine linen
whiter than snow, entertained them a long time with dancing,
in the manner of their country, afterwards with the dances of
Egypt, and at last with those of Greece. At proper intervals
the shrill voice of the trumpet interposed, and the waves resounded
to the distant shores. The silence of the night, the
calmness of the sea,<sup id="t_ref114"><a href="#t_en114">114</a></sup> the lambent radiance of the moon, which
trembled on the surface of the waves, and the deep azure of
the sky, spangled with a thousand stars, concurred to heighten
the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>Telemachus, who was remarkable for a quick and lively
sensibility, tasted all these pleasures with a high relish; yet
he did not dare to give his heart up to their influence. Since
he had experienced in the island of Calypso, to his great confusion
and disgrace, how easily a young mind is inflamed, he
regarded all pleasures, however innocent, with distrust and
dread, and watched the looks of Mentor to discover what he
thought of these.</p>

<p>Mentor was pleased with his embarrassment, but without
seeming to notice it. At length, however, touched with this
self-denial, he said, with a smile: "I know of what you are
afraid, and your fear does you honor; do not, however, let it

<!-- page 287 -->

carry you too far. It is not possible to wish you the enjoyment
of pleasure more earnestly than I wish it to you, provided
it is a pleasure that neither inflames the passions nor effeminates
the character. Your pleasures must be such as refresh
and unbend the mind, such as leave you complete master of
yourself; not such as subdue you to their power. Those that
I wish you, do not inflame the soul with a brutal fury, but
soothe it, by a sweet and gentle influence, to a pure and
peaceful enjoyment. You have endured toil and danger, and
relaxation and solace are now necessary. Accept, then, with
gratitude to Adoam, the pleasures that he now offers you;
enjoy them, my dear Telemachus, enjoy them without fear or
restraint. There is neither austerity nor affectation in Wisdom,
who is, indeed, the parent of delight, for she alone has
the secret of intermixing sports and merriment with serious
thought and important labor;&mdash;by labor she gives poignancy
to pleasure, and by pleasure she restores vigor to labor. Wisdom
blushes not to be merry when she sees a fit occasion for
mirth."<sup id="t_ref115"><a href="#t_en115">115</a></sup></p>

<p>Mentor, as he pronounced these words, took up a lyre, which
he touched with so much skill, that Achitoas, struck with surprise
and jealousy, suffered his own instrument to drop from
his hand; his eyes sparkled, his countenance changed color,
and his anguish and confusion would have been remarked by
all present, if their attention had not been wholly engrossed
by the music of Mentor. They were afraid even to breathe,
lest they should mingle any other sound with his harmony,
and lose some strain of his enchanting song. Their enjoyment
would, indeed, have been perfect, if they had not feared it
would end too soon; for the voice of Mentor, though it had no
effeminate softness, was capable of all the varieties of modulation;
it was equally melodious and strong, and had an expression
perfectly adapted to the sentiment even in the minutest
particular.</p>

<p>He first sung the praises of Jupiter, the father and the sovereign

<!-- page 288 -->

of gods and men,<sup id="t_ref116"><a href="#t_en116">116</a></sup> who shakes the universe with a nod.<sup id="t_ref117"><a href="#t_en117">117</a></sup>
He then represented, under the figure of Minerva issuing from
his head, that wisdom which, proceeding from himself, as its
only and eternal source, is diffused in boundless emanation, to
irradiate such created minds as are open to receive it. These
truths he sung in such a strain of unaffected piety, and with
such a sense of their sublimity and importance, that his audience
imagined themselves transported to the summit of Olympus,
and placed in the presence of Jupiter, whose eye is more
piercing than his thunder. He then sung the fate of Narcissus,
who becoming enamored of his own beauty, at which he gazed
incessantly from the brink of a fountain that reflected it, pined
away with ineffectual desire, and was changed into a flower
that bears his name. And he last sung of the untimely death
of the beautiful Adonis, who perished by the tusks of a boar,
and whom Venus, unable to revive, lamented with unavailing
grief.</p>

<p>The passions of the audience corresponded with the subject
of the song; they melted silently into tears, and felt an inexpressible
delight in their grief. When the music was at an
end, the Ph&oelig;nicians looked round upon each other with astonishment
and admiration. One said: "This is certainly Orpheus;
and these are the strains by which he tamed the wild
beasts of the desert, and gave motion to trees and rocks: it
was thus that he enchanted Cerberus, suspended the torments
of Ixion and the Dan&auml;ides, and touched with pity the inexorable
breast of Pluto, who permitted him to lead back the fair
Eurydice from his dominions." Another said it was Linus,
the son of Apollo; and a third, that it was Apollo himself.
Even Telemachus was little less surprised than the rest, for he
did not know that Mentor was so excellent a proficient in
music.</p>

<p>Achitoas, who had now sufficiently recollected himself to

<!-- page 289 -->

conceal his jealousy, began an encomium upon Mentor, but he
blushed as he spoke, and found himself unable to proceed.
Mentor, who perceived his confusion, was desirous to hide it
from others; and, seeing he could not go on, he began to
speak, that he might appear to interrupt him; he also endeavored
to console him, by giving him the praise due to his
merit. Achitoas, however, could not be consoled; for he felt
that Mentor surpassed him yet more in generosity than in skill.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Telemachus addressed himself to Adoam.
"I remember," said he, "that you mentioned a voyage you
made to B&oelig;tica, after we returned together from Egypt.
B&oelig;tica is a country, concerning which many wonders are
related, which it is difficult to believe. Tell me, therefore,
whether they are true." "I shall be glad," said Adoam, "to
describe that country to you; for it is well worthy your curiosity,
and is yet more extraordinary than fame has reported it.</p>

<p>"The river B&oelig;tis flows through a fertile country, where the
air is always temperate, and the sky serene. This river, which
gives name to the country, falls into the ocean near the Pillars
of Hercules; not far from the place where the sea heretofore,
breaking its bounds, separated the country of Tarsis<sup id="t_ref118"><a href="#t_en118">118</a></sup> from the
vast continent of Africa. This region seems to have preserved
all the felicity of the golden age. In the winter, the freezing
breath of the north is never felt, and the season is mild; but,
in summer, there are always refreshing gales from the west,
which blow about the middle of the day, and in this season,
therefore, the heat is never intense. Thus Spring and Autumn,
espoused as it were to each other, walk hand in hand through
the year. The valleys and the plains yield annually a double
harvest. The hedges consist of laurels, pomegranates, jasmines,
and other trees, that are not only always green, but in
flower. The mountains are covered with flocks, whose wool,
for its superior fineness, is sought by all nations. This beautiful
country contains also many mines of gold and silver; but

<!-- page 290 -->

the inhabitants, happy in their simplicity, disdain to count
silver and gold among their riches, and value that only which
contributes to supply the real and natural wants of mankind.<sup id="t_ref119"><a href="#t_en119">119</a></sup></p>

<p>"When we first traded with these people, we found gold
and silver used for ploughshares; and, in general, employed
promiscuously with iron. As they carried on no foreign trade,
they had no need of money. They were, almost all, either
shepherds or husbandmen. As they suffered no arts to be
exercised among them, but such as tended immediately to
answer the necessities of life, the number of artificers was consequently
small. A greater part even of those that live by
husbandry, or keeping of sheep, are skilful in the exercise of
such arts as are necessary to manners so simple and frugal.</p>

<p>"The women are employed in spinning the wool, and manufacturing
it into stuffs that are remarkably fine and white;
they also make the bread and dress the food, which costs
them very little trouble, for they live chiefly upon fruits and
milk, animal food being seldom eaten among them. Of the
skins of their sheep they make a light sort of covering for
their legs and feet, with which they furnish their husbands
and children. The women also make the habitations, which
are a kind of tents, covered either with waxed skins or the
bark of trees. They make and wash all the clothes of the
family, and keep their houses in great neatness and order.
Their clothes, indeed, are easily made; for, in that temperate
climate, they wear only a piece of fine white stuff, which is
not formed to the shape of the body, but wrapped round it
so as to fall in long plaits, and take what figure the wearer
thinks fit.</p>

<p>"The men cultivate the ground and manage their flocks;
and the other arts which they practise are those only of forming
wood and iron into necessary utensils; and of iron they
make little use, except in instruments of tillage. All the arts
that relate to architecture are useless to them, for they build
no houses. 'It shows too much regard to the earth,' say they,

<!-- page 291 -->

'to erect a building upon it which will last longer than ourselves;
if we are defended from the weather, it is sufficient.'
As to the other arts, which are so highly esteemed in Greece,
in Egypt, and in all other nations that have admitted the innumerable
wants of polished life, they hold them in the greatest
detestation, as the inventions of vanity and voluptuousness.</p>

<p>"When they are told of nations who have the art of erecting
superb buildings, and making splendid furniture of silver
and gold, stuffs adorned with embroidery and jewels, exquisite
perfumes, delicious meats, and instruments of music, they reply,
that the people of such nations are extremely unhappy in
employing so much ingenuity and labor to render themselves
at once corrupt and wretched. 'These superfluities,' say they,
'effeminate, intoxicate, and torment those who possess them.
They tempt those who do not possess them, to acquire them
by fraud and violence. Can that superfluity be good which
tends only to make men evil? Are the people of these countries
more healthy or more robust than we are? Do they live
longer, or agree better with each other? Do they enjoy more
liberty, tranquillity, and cheerfulness? On the contrary, are
they not jealous of each other? Are not their hearts corroded
with envy, and agitated by ambition, avarice, and terror?
Are they not incapable of pleasures that are pure and simple?
and is not this incapacity the unavoidable consequence of the
innumerable artificial wants to which they are enslaved, and
upon which they make all their happiness depend?'</p>

<p>"Such," said Adoam, "are the sentiments of this sagacious
people, who have acquired wisdom only by the study of nature.
They consider our refinements with abhorrence; and it must
be confessed, that, in their simplicity, there is something not
only amiable, but great. They live in common, without any
partition of lands. The head of every family is its king. This
patriarchal monarch has a right to punish his children, or his
grandchildren, if they are guilty of a fault; but he first takes
the advice of his family. Punishment, indeed, is very rare
among them; for innocence of manners, sincerity of heart, and
hatred of vice, seem to be the natural productions of the country.

<!-- page 292 -->

Astrea, who is said to have quitted the earth and ascended
to heaven, seems still to be hidden among these happy
people. They have no need of judges, for every man submits
to the jurisdiction of conscience. They possess all things in
common; for the cattle produce milk, and the fields and
orchards fruit and grain of every kind in such abundance, that
a people so frugal and temperate have no need of property.
They have no fixed place of abode; but when they have consumed
the fruits, and exhausted the pasturage, of one part of
the paradise which they inhabit, they remove their tents to
another. They have, therefore, no opposition of interest, but
are connected by a fraternal affection which there is nothing to
interrupt. This peace, this union, this liberty, they preserve,
by rejecting superfluous wealth and deceitful pleasure. They
are all free, and all equal.</p>

<p>"Superior wisdom, the result either of long experience of
uncommon abilities, is the only mark of distinction among
them. The sophistry of fraud, the cry of violence, the contention
of the bar, and the tumult of battle, are never heard in
this sacred region, which the gods have taken under their immediate
protection. This soil has never been stained with
human blood; and even that of a lamb has rarely been shed
upon it. When the inhabitants are told of bloody battles,
rapid conquests, and the subversion of empires, which happen
in other countries, they stand aghast with astonishment.
'What!' say they, 'do not men die fast enough without being
destroyed by each other? Can any man be insensible of the
brevity of life? and can he who knows it, think life too long?
Is it possible to suppose that men came into the world,
merely to propagate misery, and to harass and destroy one
another?'</p>

<p>"Neither can the inhabitants of B&oelig;tica comprehend how
those, who, by subjugating great empires, obtain the name of
conquerors, come to be so much the object of admiration.
'To place happiness in the government of others,' say they,
'is madness, since to govern well is a painful task. But a
desire to govern others against their will, is madness in a still

<!-- page 293 -->

greater degree. A wise man cannot, without violence to himself,
submit to take upon himself the government of a willing
people, whom the gods have committed to his charge, or who
apply to him for guidance and protection; but to govern a
people against their will, is to become miserable for the false
honor of holding others in slavery. A conqueror is one whom
the gods, provoked by the wickedness of mankind, send in
their wrath upon the earth, to ravage kingdoms; to spread
around them in a vast circle, terror, misery, and despair; to
destroy the brave, and enslave the free. Has not he, who is
ambitious of glory, sufficient opportunities of acquiring it, by
managing with wisdom what the gods have intrusted to his
care? Can it be imagined that praise is merited only by arrogance
and injustice, by usurpation and tyranny? War should
never be thought of, but in the defence of liberty. Happy is
he who, not being the slave of another, is free from the frantic
ambition of making another a slave to him! Those conquerors
who are represented as encircled with glory, resemble rivers
that have overflowed their banks, which appear majestic, indeed,
but which desolate the countries they ought to fertilize.' "</p>

<p>After Adoam had given this description of B&oelig;tica, Telemachus,
who had listened to it with great delight, asked him several
questions, which would not have been suggested by common
curiosity. "Do the inhabitants of B&oelig;tica," said he,
"drink wine?" "They are so far from drinking wine," said
Adoam, "that they make none; not because they are without
grapes, for no country in the world produces them in greater
plenty or perfection; but they content themselves with eating
them as they do other fruit, and are afraid of wine as the corrupter
of mankind. 'Wine,' they say, 'is a species of poison,
which produces madness; which does not kill men, indeed,
but degrades them into brutes. Men may preserve their
health and their vigor without wine; but, with wine, not
only their health, but their virtue is in danger.' "</p>

<p>Telemachus then inquired what laws were established in
B&oelig;tica relating to marriage. "No man," said Adoam, "is
allowed to have more than one wife; and every man is obliged

<!-- page 294 -->

to keep his wife as long as she lives. In this country a man's
reputation depends as much upon his fidelity to his wife, as a
woman's reputation, in other countries, depends upon her fidelity
to her husband. No people ever practised so scrupulous a
decorum, or were so jealous of their chastity. Their women
are beautiful and agreeable, but simple, modest, and laborious.
Their marriages are peaceable, fruitful, and undefiled. The
husband and wife seem to be two bodies animated by one soul.
The husband manages affairs without, and the wife within; she
provides for his refreshment at his return, and seems to live
only to please him; she gains his confidence; and, as she
charms him yet more by her virtue than her beauty, their happiness
is such as death only can destroy. From this temperance,
sobriety, and simplicity of manners, they derive longevity
and health. It is common to see among them men a hundred
or a hundred and twenty years old, who have all the cheerfulness
and vigor that make life desirable."</p>

<p>"But how," said Telemachus, "do they escape the calamities
of war?  Are they never invaded by other nations?"</p>

"Nature," said Adoam, "has separated them from other
nations, by the sea on one side, and by mountains almost inaccessible
on the other. Besides, their virtue has impressed
foreign powers with reverence and awe. When any contest
arises among the neighboring States, they frequently make a
common deposit of the territory in question in the hands of the
B&oelig;ticans, and appoint them arbitrators of the dispute. As
these wise people are guilty of no violence, they are never mistrusted.
They laugh when they hear of kings who disagree
about the boundaries of their country. 'Are they afraid,' say
they, 'that the earth will not contain room for its inhabitants?
There will always be much more land than can be cultivated:
and while any remains unappropriated by cultivation, we should
think it folly to defend even our own against those who would
invade it.' These people are, indeed, wholly free from pride,
fraud, and ambition. They do no injury, they violate no compact,
they covet no territory. Their neighbors, therefore,
having nothing to fear from them, nor any hope of making

<!-- page 295 -->

themselves feared by them, give them no disturbance. They
would sooner abandon their country, or die upon the spot, than
submit to a state of slavery; so that the same qualities which
render them incapable of subjugating others, render it almost
impossible for others to subjugate them. For these reasons,
there is always a profound peace between them and their
neighbors."</p>

<p>Adoam proceeded to give an account of the traffic which the
Ph&oelig;nicians carried on in B&oelig;tica. "The inhabitants of that
happy country," said he, "were astonished when they first saw
the waves bringing strangers from a distant region to their
coast. They received us, however, with great benevolence,
and gave us part of whatever they had, without asking or
expecting a return. They suffered us to establish a colony on
the island of Gadira, and offered us whatever should remain of
their wool, after their own necessities were supplied&mdash;sending
us, at the same time, a considerable quantity of it as a present;
for they have great pleasure in bestowing their superfluities
upon strangers.</p>

<p>"As to their mines they made no use of them; and therefore,
without reluctance, left them entirely to us. Men, they
thought, were not over-wise who, with so much labor, searched
in the bowels of the earth for that which could give no true happiness,
nor satisfy any natural want. They admonished us not
to dig in the earth too deep. 'Content yourselves,' said they,
'with ploughing it, and it will yield you real benefits in
return; it will yield those things to which gold and silver owe
all their value; for gold and silver are valuable only as a means
of procuring the necessaries of life.'</p>

"We frequently offered to teach them navigation, and carry
some of their youth with us to Ph&oelig;nicia; but they never
would consent that their children should live as we do. 'If
our children were to go with you,' said they, 'their wants
would soon be as numerous as yours. The nameless variety of
things which you have made necessary, would become necessary
to them; they would be restless till these artificial wants
were supplied: and they would renounce their virtue, by the

<!-- page 296 -->

practice of dishonest arts to supply them. They would soon
resemble a man of good limbs and a sound constitution, who
having by long inactivity forgotten how to walk, is under the
necessity of being carried like a cripple.' As to navigation,
they admire it as a curious art, but they believe it to be pernicious.
'If these people,' say they, 'have the necessaries of life
in their own country, what do they seek in ours? Will not
those things which satisfy the wants of nature satisfy their
wants? Surely, they that defy the tempest to gratify avarice
or luxury, deserve shipwreck.' "</p>

<p>Telemachus listened to this discourse of Adoam with unspeakable
delight, and rejoiced that there was yet a people in
the world, who, by a perfect conformity to the law of nature,
were so wise and so happy. "How different," said he, "are the
manners of this nation from those which, in nations that have
obtained the highest reputation for wisdom, are tainted throughout
with vanity and ambition! We are so accustomed to the
follies that have depraved us that we can scarcely believe this
simplicity&mdash;though it is, indeed, the simplicity of nature&mdash;to be
real. We consider the manners of these people as a splendid
fiction, and they must regard ours as a preposterous dream."</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb08">BOOK VIII.</h2>

<p class="small">Venus, still incensed against Telemachus, requests of Jupiter that he may
perish; but this not being permitted by the Fates, the goddess consults
with Neptune how his return to Ithaca, whither Adoam is conducting
him, may be prevented. They employ an illusive divinity to deceive
Acamas the pilot, who, supposing the land before him to be Ithaca,
enters full sail into the port of Salentum. Telemachus is kindly received
by Idomeneus in his new city, where he is preparing a sacrifice to Jupiter,
that he may be successful in a war against the Mandurians. The
entrails of the victims being consulted by the priest, he perceives the
omens to be happy, but declares that Idomeneus will owe his good fortune
to his guests.</p>

<p>WHILE Telemachus and Adoam were engaged in conversation,
forgetful of sleep, and not perceiving that the night was
already half spent, an unfriendly and deceitful power turned
their course from Ithaca, which Acamas,<sup id="t_ref120"><a href="#t_en120">120</a></sup> their pilot, sought in
vain. Neptune, although he was propitious to the Ph&oelig;nicians,
could not bear the escape of Telemachus from the tempest
which had shipwrecked him on the island of Calypso. Venus
was still more provoked at the triumph of a youth who had
been victorious over all the power and wiles of Love. Her
bosom throbbed at once with grief and indignation. She could
not endure the places where Telemachus had treated her sovereignty
with contempt; turning, therefore, from Cythera,
Paphos, and Idalia, and disregarding the homage that was paid
her in the isle of Cyprus, she ascended the radiant summit of
Olympus, where the gods were assembled round the throne of
Jupiter. From this place they behold the stars rolling beneath
their feet; and this earth, an obscure and diminutive spot, is
scarcely distinguished among them. The vast oceans appear

<!-- page 298 -->

but as drops of water, and the most extended empires but as a
little sand scattered between them. The innumerable multitudes
that swarm upon the surface of the globe are like insects,
and the most powerful armies resemble clusters of ants,
contending for a grain of corn or a blade of grass. Whatever
is most important in the consideration of men excites the
smiles of the gods, like the sport of children; and what we
distinguish by the names of grandeur, glory, power, and policy,
is, in their sight, no better than misery and folly.</p>

<p>On this stupendous height Jupiter has fixed his everlasting
throne. His eyes penetrate to the centre, and pass in a moment
through all the labyrinths of the heart; his smile diffuses
over all nature serenity and joy; but at his frown, not only
earth, but heaven trembles. The gods themselves are dazzled
with the glory that surrounds him, and approach not his
throne but with reverence and fear.</p>

<p>He was now surrounded by the celestial deities. Venus
presented herself before him, in all the splendor of that beauty
of which she is herself the source. Her robe, which flowed
negligently round her, exceeded in brightness all the colors
with which Iris decks herself amid the dusky clouds, when
she promises to affrighted mortals that the storm shall have an
end, and that calm and sunshine shall return. Her waist was
encircled by that famous zone<sup id="t_ref121"><a href="#t_en121">121</a></sup> which comprises every grace
that can excite desire, and her hair was tied negligently
behind in a fillet of gold. The gods were struck with her
beauty, as if they had never seen it before; and their eyes were
dazzled with its brightness, like those of mortals when the first
radiance of the sun unexpectedly breaks upon them after a
long night. They glanced a hasty look of astonishment at
each other, but their eyes still centered in her; they perceived

<!-- page 299 -->

however, that she had been weeping, and that grief was strongly
pictured in her countenance.</p>

<p>In the mean time she advanced towards the throne of Jupiter
with a light and easy motion, like the flight of a bird, which
glides unresisted through the regions of the air. The god received
her with a smile of divine complacency, and, rising
from his seat, embraced her.<sup id="t_ref122"><a href="#t_en122">122</a></sup> "What is it, my dear child,"
said he, "that has troubled you? I cannot behold your tears
with indifference: fear not to tell me all that is in your heart;
you know the tenderness of my affection, and my readiness to
indulge your wish."</p>

<p>"O father, both of gods and men," replied the goddess, with
a sweet and gentle, but interrupted voice, "can you, from whom
nothing is hidden, be ignorant of the cause of my distress?
Minerva, not satisfied with having subverted to its foundation
the superb city which was under my protection, nor with having
gratified her revenge upon Paris for judging her beauty to
be inferior to mine, conducts in safety, through every nation
and over every sea, the son of Ulysses, by whose cruel subtlety
the ruin of Troy was effected. Minerva is now the companion
of Telemachus; and it is for this reason that her place among
the celestial deities, who surround the throne of Jupiter, is
vacant. She has conducted that presumptuous mortal to
Cyprus, only that he might insult me. He has despised my
power; he disdained even to burn incense upon my altars; he
turned with abhorrence from the feasts which are there celebrated
to my honor; and he has barred his heart against every
pleasure that I inspire. Neptune has, at my request, provoked
the winds and waves against him in vain. He was shipwrecked
in a dreadful storm upon the island of Calypso; but he has
there triumphed over Love himself, whom I sent to soften his
unfeeling heart. Neither the youth nor the beauty of Calypso
and her nymphs, nor the burning shafts of immortal Love,

<!-- page 300 -->

have been able to defeat the artifices of Minerva. She has
torn him from that island; a stripling has triumphed over me,
and I am overwhelmed with confusion."</p>

<p>"It is true, my daughter," said Jupiter, who was desirous to
soothe her sorrows, "that Minerva defends the breast of Telemachus
against all the arrows of your son, and designs a glory
for him which no youth has yet deserved. I am not pleased
that he has despised your altars; but I cannot subject him to
your power. I consent, however, for your sake, that he shall
be still a wanderer by land and sea; that he shall be still distant
from his country, and still exposed to danger and misfortune;
but the Destinies forbid that he shall perish; nor will
they permit his virtue to be drowned in the pleasures which
you vouchsafe to man. Take comfort, then, my child; remember
over how many heroes and gods your sway is absolute,
and be content."</p>

<p>While he thus spoke, a gracious smile blended ineffable
sweetness and majesty over his countenance. A glancing
radiance issued from his eye, brighter and more piercing than
lightning. He kissed the goddess with tenderness, and the
mountain was suffused with ambrosial odors. This favor from
the sovereign of the skies could not fail to touch the sensibility
of Venus; her countenance kindled into a lively expression of
joy, and she drew down her veil to hide her blushes and confusion.
The divine assembly applauded the words of Jupiter;
and Venus, without losing a moment, went in search of Neptune,
to concert new means of revenging herself upon Telemachus.</p>

<p>She told Neptune all that Jupiter had said. "I knew already,"
replied Neptune, "the unchangeable decrees of fate;
but if we cannot overwhelm Telemachus in the deep, let us
neglect nothing that may make him wretched, or delay his
return to Ithaca. I cannot consent to destroy the Ph&oelig;nician
vessel in which he is embarked. I love the Ph&oelig;nicians; they
are my peculiar people, and they do more honor to my dominion
than any other nation on earth. They have rendered
the ocean itself the bond of society, by which the most distant
countries are united.  Their sacrifices continually smoke upon

<!-- page 301 -->

my altars; they are inflexibly just; they are the fathers of
commerce, and diffuse through all nations convenience and
plenty. I cannot, therefore, permit one of their vessels to
suffer shipwreck; but I will cause the pilot to mistake his
course, and steer from Ithaca, the port that he designs to
make."</p>

<p>Venus, satisfied with this promise, expressed her pleasure by
a malignant smile, and turned the rapid wheels of her celestial
chariot over the blooming plains of Idalia, where the Graces,
the Sports, and the Smiles expressed their joy at her return,
by dancing round her upon the flowers, which, in that delightful
country, variegate the ground with beauty and fill the air
with fragrance.</p>

<p>Neptune immediately dispatched one of the deities which
preside over those deceptions which resemble Dreams; except
that Dreams affect only those that sleep, and these impose
upon the waking. This malevolent power, attended by a
number of winged Illusions that perpetually fluttered round
him, shed a subtle and fascinating liquor over the eyes of Acamas,
the pilot, while he was attentively considering the brightness
of the moon, the course of the stars, and the coast of
Ithaca, the cliffs of which he discovered not far distant.</p>

<p>From that moment the eyes of Acamas became unfaithful
to their objects, and presented to him a false heaven and deceptive
earth. The stars appeared as if their course had been
inverted. Olympus seemed to move by new laws, and the
earth itself to have changed its position. A false Ithaca rose
up before him, while he was steering from the real country.
The delusive shore fled as he approached it: he perceived
that he did not gain upon it, and he wondered at the cause.
Yet sometimes he fancied he heard the noise of people in the
port; and he was about to make preparations, according to
the orders he had received, for putting Telemachus ashore
on a little island adjacent to that of Ithaca, in order to conceal
his return from the suitors of Penelope, who had conspired
for his destruction. Sometimes he thought himself in danger
of the rocks which surround the coast, and imagined that he

<!-- page 302 -->

heard the dreadful roaring of the surge that broke against
them; then the land suddenly appeared to be again distant;
and the mountains looked like the small clouds which sometimes
obscure the horizon at the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Thus was Acamas astonished and confounded; and the influence
of the deity which had deceived his sight impressed a
dread upon his mind, which, till then, he had never felt. He
sometimes almost doubted whether he was awake, or whether
what he saw was not the illusion of a dream. In the mean
time, Neptune commanded the east wind to blow, that the
vessel might be driven upon the coast of Hesperia. The wind
obeyed with such violence that the coast of Hesperia was immediately
before them.</p>

<p>Aurora had already proclaimed the day to be at hand; and
the stars, touched at once with fear and envy at the rays of
the sun, retired to conceal their fading fires in the bosom of
the deep, when the pilot suddenly cried out: "I am now sure
of my port; the island of Ithaca is before us, and we almost
touch the shore. Rejoice, O Telemachus, for in less than an
hour you will embrace Penelope, and perhaps again behold
Ulysses upon his throne."</p>

<p>This exclamation roused Telemachus, who was now in a
profound sleep. He awaked, started up, and, running to the
helm, embraced the pilot, at the same time fixing his eyes,
which were scarcely open, upon the neighboring coast. The
view struck him, at once, with surprise and disappointment,
for in these shores he found no resemblance of his country.
"Alas!" said he, "where are we? This is not Ithaca, the dear
island that I seek. You are certainly mistaken, and are not
perfectly acquainted with a country so distant from your own."
"No," replied Acamas, "I cannot be mistaken in the coast of
the island. I have entered the port so often that I am acquainted
with every rock, and have not a more exact remembrance
even of Tyre itself. Observe that mountain which runs
out from the shore, and that rock which rises like a tower.
Do you not see others, that, projecting from above, seem to
threaten the sea with their fall? and do you not hear the

<!-- page 303 -->

waves that break against them below? There is the temple
of Minerva which seems to penetrate to the clouds, and there
the citadel and the palace of Ulysses."</p>

<p>"Still you are mistaken," replied Telemachus. "I see a
coast which is elevated, indeed, but level and unbroken. I
perceive a city, but it is not Ithaca. Is it thus, ye gods, that
ye sport with men?"</p>

<p>While Telemachus was yet speaking, the eyes of Acamas
were again changed. The charm was broken; he saw the
coast as it was, and acknowledged his mistake. "I confess,"
said he, "O Telemachus, that some unfriendly power has fascinated
my sight. I thought I beheld the coast of Ithaca, of
which a perfect image was represented to me, that is now vanished
like a dream. I now see another city, and know it to be
Salentum<sup id="t_ref123"><a href="#t_en123">123</a></sup>, which Idomeneus, a fugitive from Crete, is founding
in Hesperia: I perceive rising walls as yet unfinished; and I
see a port not entirely fortified."</p>

<p>While Acamas was remarking the various works which
were building in this rising city, and Telemachus was deploring
his misfortunes, the wind, which Neptune had commanded to
blow, carried them with full sails into the road, where they
found themselves under shelter, and very near the port.</p>

<p>Mentor, who was neither ignorant of the resentment of Neptune
nor the cruel artifices of Venus, only smiled at the mistake
of Acamas. When they had got safe into the road, he
said to Telemachus: "Jupiter tries you, but he will not suffer
you to perish; he tries you, that he may open before you the
path of glory. Remember the labors of Hercules, and let the
achievements of your father be always present to your mind.
He that knows not how to suffer, has no greatness of soul.
You must weary fortune,<sup id="t_ref124"><a href="#t_en124">124</a></sup> who delights to persecute you, by
patience and fortitude. Be assured that you are much less
endangered by the displeasure of Neptune than by the caresses

<!-- page 304 -->

of Calypso. But why do we delay to enter the harbor? The
people here are our friends, for they are natives of Greece;
and Idomeneus, having himself been ill-treated by fortune, will
naturally be touched with pity at our distress."<sup id="t_ref125"><a href="#t_en125">125</a></sup> They immediately
entered the port of Salentum, where the Ph&oelig;nicians
were admitted without scruple, for they are at peace and in
trade with every nation upon earth.</p>

<p>Telemachus looked upon that rising city with admiration.
As a young plant that has been watered with the dews of the
night feels the glow of the morning sun, grows under the
genial influence, opens its buds, unfolds its leaves, spreads out
its odoriferous flowers, variegated with a thousand dyes, and
discloses every moment some fresh beauty; so flourished this
infant city of Idomeneus on the borders of the deep. It rose
into greater magnificence every hour, and discovered in a distant
prospect, to the strangers that approached it by sea, new
ornaments of architecture that seemed to reach the clouds.
The whole coast resounded with the voices of workmen and
the strokes of the hammer, and huge stones were seen suspended
from pulleys in the air. As soon as the morning
dawned, the people were animated to their labor by their
chiefs; and Idomeneus himself being present to dispense his
orders, the works were carried on with incredible expedition.</p>

<p>As soon as the Ph&oelig;nician vessel came to shore, the Cretans
received Telemachus and Mentor with all the tokens of a sincere
friendship. They immediately acquainted Idomeneus
that the son of Ulysses had arrived in his dominions. "The
son of Ulysses!" said he, "of my dear friend Ulysses! of him,
who is at once a hero and a sage, by whose council alone the
destruction of Troy was accomplished? Let him be conducted
hither, that I may convince him how much I loved his father!"
Telemachus being then presented to him, told him his name
and then demanded the rights of hospitality.</p>

<!-- page 305 -->

<p>Idomeneus received him with a smile of tender cordiality.
"I believe," said he, "I should have known you, if I had not
been told your name. I perceive your father's fire and firmness
in your eye, the same coldness and reserve in your first
address, which, in him, concealed so much vivacity and such
various grace. You have his smile of conscious penetration,
his easy negligence, and his sweet, simple, and insinuating
elocution, which takes the soul captive before it can prepare
for defence. You are, indeed, the son of Ulysses; and from this
hour you shall also be mine. Tell me, then, what adventure
has brought you to this coast? Are you in search of your
father? Alas! of your father I can give you no intelligence.
Fortune has equally persecuted both him and me; he has
never been able to return to his country, and I became the
victim of divine displeasure in mine."</p>

<p>While Idomeneus was thus speaking to Telemachus, he fixed
his eyes attentively upon Mentor, as a man whose countenance
was not wholly unknown to him, though he could not recollect
his name.</p>

<p>In the mean time the eyes of Telemachus were filled with
tears. "Forgive," said he, "O king, the grief that I cannot
hide. I ought now, indeed, to betray no passion, but joy at
your presence, and gratitude for your bounty; yet, by the
regret you express for the loss of Ulysses, you impress me
with a new sense of my misfortune in the loss of a father.
I have already long sought him through all the regions of the
deep. Such is the displeasure of the gods, that they neither
permit me to find him, nor to learn whether the sea has not
closed over him forever; nor yet to return to Ithaca, where
Penelope pines with an anxious desire to be delivered from her
lovers. I hoped to have found you in Crete, where I only
heard the story of your misfortunes; and I had then no
thought of approaching the coast of Hesperia, where you have
founded another kingdom. But fortune, which sports with
mankind, and keeps me wandering through every country that
is distant from my own, has at length thrown me upon your
coast&mdash;a misfortune which I regret less than any other, since,

<!-- page 306 -->

though I am driven from Ithaca, I am at least brought to
Idomeneus, the most generous of men."</p>

<p>Idomeneus, having embraced Telemachus with great tenderness,
conducted him to his palace, where he inquired what
venerable old man it was that accompanied him. "I think,"
said he, "that I have somewhere seen him before." "That is
Mentor," replied Telemachus, "the friend of Ulysses, to whose
care he confided my infancy, and to whom my obligations are
more than I can express."</p>

<p>Idomeneus immediately advanced towards Mentor, and gave
him his hand. "We have seen each other before," said he;
"do you remember the voyage that you made to Crete, and
the good counsel that you gave me there? I was then carried
away by the impetuosity of youth, and the love of deceitful
pleasure. It was necessary that what I refused to learn
from wisdom, I should be taught by adversity. Would to
heaven that I had confided in your counsel! But I am astonished
to see that so many years have made so little alteration
in your appearance; there is the same freshness in your countenance;
your stature is still erect, and your vigor is undiminished:
I see no difference, except that there are a few more
gray hairs upon your head."</p>

<p>"If I were inclined to flatter," replied Mentor, "I would say
that you also preserve the same bloom of youth which glowed
upon your countenance before the siege of Troy; but I had
rather deny myself the pleasure of gratifying you, than offend
against truth. I perceive, indeed, by the wisdom of your discourse,
that, from flattery, you could receive no gratification,
and that he who speaks to Idomeneus risks nothing by his
sincerity. You are, indeed, much changed; so much, that I
should scarcely have known you. But I am not ignorant of
the cause&mdash;the hand of misfortune has been upon you. You
are, however, a gainer, even by your sufferings; for they have
taught you wisdom. The wrinkles that Time impresses on
your face ought not much to be regretted, if, in the mean
while, he is planting virtue in the breast. Besides, it should
be considered that kings must wear out faster than other men.

<!-- page 307 -->

In adversity, the solicitude of the mind and the fatigues of the
body bring on infirmities of age before they are old. In
prosperity, the indulgences of a voluptuous life wear them out
still more than physical or mental toil. Nothing is so fatal to
health as immoderate pleasure; therefore kings, both in peace
and war, have pains and pleasures which precipitate old age.
A sober, temperate, and simple life, free from the inquietudes
both of accident and passion, divided in due proportions between
labor and rest, continues long to the wise the blessings
of youth, which, if these precautions do not retain them, are
ever ready to fly away upon the wings of time."</p>

<p>Idomeneus, who listened with delight to the wisdom of Mentor,
would longer have indulged himself in so noble a pleasure,
if he had not been reminded of a sacrifice which he was to
offer to Jupiter. Telemachus and Mentor followed him to the
temple, surrounded by a crowd of people, who gazed at the
two strangers with great eagerness and curiosity. "These
men," said they, "are very different from each other. The
younger has something sprightly and amiable, that is hard to
be defined; all the graces of youth and beauty are diffused
over his whole person, yet he has nothing effeminately soft;
though the bloom of youth is scarcely ripened into manhood,
he appears vigorous, robust, and inured to labor. The other,
though much older, has suffered no injury from time; at the
first view, his general appearance is less noble, and his countenance
less gracious; but, upon a closer examination, we find,
under this unassuming simplicity, strong indications both of
wisdom and of virtue, with a kind of nameless superiority
that excites at once both reverence and admiration. When
the gods descended upon the earth, they doubtless assumed
the form of such strangers and travellers as these."<sup id="t_ref126"><a href="#t_en126">126</a></sup></p>

<p>In the mean time, they arrived at the temple of Jupiter,
which Idomeneus, who was descended from the god, had

<!-- page 308 -->

adorned with the utmost magnificence. It was surrounded
with a double range of columns of variegated marble, the
capitals of which were of silver. The whole building was
cased with marble, enriched with bas-reliefs that represented
the transformation of Jupiter into a bull, and his rape of Europa,
whom he bore into Crete through the waves, which seemed
to reverence the god, though he was concealed under a borrowed
form; and the birth of Minos, the events of his youth,
and the dispensation of those laws in his more advanced age,
which were calculated to perpetuate the prosperity of his country.
Telemachus observed also representations of the principal
events in the siege of Troy, at which Idomeneus acquired great
military renown. Among these representations, Telemachus
looked for his father; and he found him seizing the horses of
Rhesus, whom Diomedes had just slain; disputing the armor
of Achilles with Ajax, before the princes of Greece; and descending
from the fatal horse, to deluge Troy with the blood
of her inhabitants.<sup id="t_ref127"><a href="#t_en127">127</a></sup></p>

<p>By these achievements Telemachus knew his father; for he
had frequently heard them mentioned, and they had been
particularly described by Mentor. His mind kindled as he
considered them; the tears swelled in his eyes; he changed
color, and his countenance was troubled. He turned away his
face to conceal his confusion, which, however, was perceived
by the king. "Do not be ashamed," said Idomeneus, "that
we should see how sensibly you are touched with the glory
and misfortunes of your father."</p>

<p>The people were now gathered in a throng under the vast
porticos, which were formed by the double range of columns
that surrounded the building. There were two companies of
boys and virgins, who sung hymns to the praise of the god,
in whose hand are the thunders of the sky. These children
were selected for their beauty, and had long hair, which flowed
in loose curls over their shoulders. They were clothed in
white, and their heads were crowned with roses and sprinkled

<!-- page 309 -->

with perfume. Idomeneus sacrificed a hundred bulls to Jupiter,
to obtain success in a war which he had undertaken
against the neighboring States. The blood of the victims
smoked on every side, and was received into large vases of
silver and gold.</p>

<p>Theophanes, the priest of the temple, venerable for his age,
and beloved of the god, having kept his head covered, during
the ceremony, with the skirt of his purple robe, proceeded to
examine the still panting entrails of the victims. He then
mounted the sacred tripod and cried out: "Who, ye gods,
are these strangers that ye have brought among us? Without
them, the war which we have undertaken would have
been fatal, and Salentum would have fallen into ruin while it
was yet rising from its foundation. I see a hero in the bloom
of youth; I see him conducted by the hand of Wisdom. To
mortal lips thus much only is permitted."</p>

<p>While he spoke his looks became wild, and his eyes fiery;
he seemed to see other objects than those that were before
him; his countenance was inflamed, his hair stood up, his
mouth foamed, his arms, which were stretched upwards, remained
immovable, and all his faculties seemed to be under
a supernatural influence. His voice was more than human;
he gasped for breath,<sup id="t_ref128"><a href="#t_en128">128</a></sup> and was agonized by the divine spirit
that moved within him.</p>

<p>"O happy Idomeneus," again he exclaimed, "what do I see!
tremendous evils! but they are averted. Within there is
peace, but without there is battle! There is victory! O
Telemachus, thy achievements surpass those of thy father!
Under thy falchion, pride and hostility grovel in the dust together,
and gates of brass and inaccessible ramparts fall in
one ruin at thy feet!  O mighty goddess, let his father&mdash;&mdash;Illustrious
youth, thou shalt again behold&mdash;&mdash;."  Here the

<!-- page 310 -->

words died upon his tongue, and his powers were involuntarily
suspended in silence and astonishment.</p>

<p>The multitude was chilled with horror.<sup id="t_ref129"><a href="#t_en129">129</a></sup> Idomeneus trembled,
and did not dare to urge Theophanes to proceed. Telemachus
himself scarcely comprehended what he had heard,
and almost doubted whether predictions so sublime and important
had really been delivered. Mentor was the only person,
in that vast assembly, whom the effusion of the divinity
had not astonished. "You hear," said he to Idomeneus, "the
purposes of the gods. Against whatever nation you shall turn
your arms, your victory is secure; but it is to this youth, the
son of your friend, that you will owe your success. Be not
jealous of his honor, but receive with gratitude what the gods
shall give you by his hand."</p>

<p>Idomeneus endeavored to reply, but not being yet recovered
from his surprise, he could find no words, and therefore remained
silent. Telemachus was more master of himself, and
said to Mentor: "The promise of so much glory does not
much affect me; I desire only to know the meaning of those
last words, 'Thou shalt again behold.' Is it my father, or my
country only, that I shall behold again? Why, alas! was the
sentence left unfinished? why was it so broken as rather to
increase than diminish my uncertainty? O Ulysses! O my
father! is it thy very self that I shall again behold? Is this possible?
Alas! my wishes deceive me into hope; this cruel
oracle has only sported with my misfortunes; one word more
would have made me completely happy!"</p>

<p>"Reverence what the gods have revealed," said Mentor,
"and do not seek to discover what they have hidden. It is fit
that presumptuous curiosity should be covered with confusion.
The gods, in the abundance of their wisdom and mercy, have
concealed the future from the sight of man in impenetrable
darkness. It is proper, indeed, that we should know the event
of what depends wholly upon ourselves, as a motive to rectitude

<!-- page 311 -->

of conduct; but it is equally fit that we should be ignorant
of those events over which we have no influence, and of
what the gods have determined to be our lot."</p>

<p>Telemachus felt the force of this reply, yet he could not
restrain himself without difficulty.</p>

<p>In the mean time Idomeneus, having perfectly recovered the
possession of his mind, began to express his gratitude to Jupiter,
for having sent Telemachus and Mentor to give him victory
over his enemies. A magnificent entertainment was given after
the sacrifice, and he then addressed the strangers to this effect:</p>

<p>"I confess that when I returned from the siege of Troy to
Crete, I was not sufficiently acquainted with the arts of government.
You are not ignorant, my dear friends, of the misfortunes
which excluded me from the sovereignty of that
extensive island; for you tell me that you have been there
since I left it. Happy am I, if my misfortunes have taught me
wisdom and moderation. I traversed the seas, like a fugitive,
pursued by the vengeance both of heaven and earth; the elevation
of my former state served but to aggravate my fall. I
sought an asylum for my household gods upon this desert
coast, which I found covered with thorns and brambles, with
impenetrable forests, as ancient as the earth upon which they
grew, and abounding with almost inaccessible rocks, in which
the wild beasts that prowled at night took shelter in the day.
Such was my necessity, that I was glad to take possession of
this desolate wilderness, with a small number of soldiers and
friends who kindly became the companions of my misfortunes,
and to consider these deserts as my country&mdash;having no hope
of returning to that happy island in which it was the will of
the gods that I should be born to reign. I felt the change
with the keenest sensibility. What a dreadful example, said I,
is Idomeneus to other kings, and what instructions may they
derive from my sufferings! They imagine that their elevation
above the rest of men is a security from misfortune; but, alas!
their very superiority is their danger. I was dreaded by my
enemies and beloved by my subjects; I commanded a powerful
and warlike nation; fame had acquainted the remotest regions

<!-- page 312 -->

with my glory; I was the lord of a fertile and delightful country;
I received tribute from the wealth of a hundred cities;
I was acknowledged, by the Cretans, to be descended from
Jupiter, who was born in their country; I was beloved as the
grandson of Minos, whose laws at once rendered them powerful
and happy. What was wanting to my felicity, but the knowledge
how to enjoy it with moderation? My pride, and the
adulation which gratified it, subverted my throne. I fell, as
every king must fall who delivers himself up to his own passions
and to the counsels of flattery.</p>

<p>"When I came hither, I labored to conceal my anguish by
a look of cheerfulness and hope, that I might support the
courage of my companions. 'Let us build a new city,' said I,
'to console us for what we have lost. We are surrounded with
people who have set us a fair example for the undertaking.
We see Tarentum rising near us, a city founded by Phalanthus
and his Lacedemonians. Philoctetes is building Petilia
on the same coast, and Metapontum is another colony of the
like kind. Shall we do less than these strangers have done,
who are wanderers as well as we, and to whom fortune has not
been less severe?'</p>

<p>"But I wanted the comfort which I sought to bestow, and
concealed in my own bosom that anguish which I soothed in
others. I hoped no other alleviation of anguish than to be
released from the constraint of hiding it, and anticipated the
close of the day with comfort, when, surrounded by the shades
of night, I might indulge my sorrows without a witness. My
eyes were then drowned in tears, and sleep was a stranger to
my bed. Yet, the next morning, I renewed my labor with
equal ardor and perseverance. These are the causes why I am
old before my time."</p>

<p>Idomeneus then requested the assistance of Telemachus and
Mentor, in the war that he had undertaken. "I will send you
to Ithaca," said he, "as soon as it shall be over. In the mean
time, I will dispatch ships to every country in quest of
Ulysses, and from whatever part of the known world on which
he shall have been cast by a tempest, or by the resentment of

<!-- page 313 -->

some adverse deity, he shall be brought in safety. May the
gods grant that he is still alive! As for you, I will embark
you in the best vessels that ever were built in the island of
Crete&mdash;vessels that are constructed of trees which grew upon
Mount Ida, the birth-place of Jupiter. That sacred wood can
never perish in the deep; it is reverenced equally by the rocks
and winds. Neptune himself, in the utmost fury of his wrath,
does not dare to swell the waves against it. Be assured,
therefore, that you shall return to Ithaca in safety, and that no
adverse deity shall again drive you to another coast. The
voyage is short and easy. Dismiss, therefore, the Ph&oelig;nician
vessel that has brought you hither, and think only of the glory
you will acquire by establishing the new kingdom of Idomeneus,
to atone for his sufferings that are past. This, O son of
Ulysses, shall prove that thou art worthy of thy father. Even
if the inexorable Fates have already compelled him to descend
into the gloomy dominions of Pluto, Greece shall think with
pleasure that she still sees her Ulysses in thee."</p>

<p>Here Idomeneus was interrupted by Telemachus. "Let us
send away the Ph&oelig;nician vessel," said he; "why should we
delay to take arms against your enemies, since your enemies
must also be ours? If we have been victorious in behalf
of Acestes, a Trojan, and consequently an enemy to Greece,
should we not exert ourselves with more ardor, and shall we
not be more favored by the gods in the cause of a Grecian
prince, a confederate of those heroes by whom the perfidious
city of Priam was overturned? Surely, the oracle that we
have just heard has made doubt impossible."</p>

<hr/>

<h2 class="center" id="tb09">BOOK IX.</h2>

<p class="small">Idomeneus acquaints Mentor with the cause of the war: he tells him that
the Mandurians ceded to him the coast of Hesperia, where he had
founded his new city as soon as he arrived; that they withdrew to the
neighboring mountains, where having been ill-treated by some of his
people, they had sent deputies with whom he had settled articles of
peace; and that after a breach of that treaty, on the part of Idomeneus,
by some hunters who knew nothing of it, the Mandurians prepared to
attack him. During this recital, the Mandurians, having already taken
arms, appear at the gates of Salentum. Nestor, Philoctetes, and Phalanthus,
whom Idomeneus supposed to be neuter, appear to have joined
them with their forces. Mentor goes out of Salentum alone, and proposes
new conditions of peace. Telemachus seeing Mentor in the midst
of the allies, is impatient to know what passes between them. He causes
the gates of Salentum to be opened, and joins his friend. His presence
inclines the allies to accept the terms that Mentor has offered on the
part of Idomeneus. The allies enter Salentum as friends. Idomeneus
confirms the propositions of Mentor; hostages are reciprocally given; and
all parties assist at a sacrifice between the city and the camp, as a
solemn ratification of the treaty.</p>

<p>MENTOR, regarding, with a benign and tranquil eye, Telemachus,
who was already filled with a noble ardor for the combat,
said to him: "I see with pleasure, O son of Ulysses, the
desire of glory that now sparkles in your eyes; but you must
remember that your father acquired his pre-eminence among
the confederate princes at the siege of Troy, by his superior
wisdom and dispassionate counsels. Achilles, though he was
invincible and invulnerable, though he was sure to spread
terror and destruction wherever he fought, could never take
the city of Troy, which, when he expired under her walls,
stood yet unshaken, and triumphed over the conqueror of
Hector. But Ulysses, whose valor was under the direction
of consummate prudence, carried fire and sword to its centre;
and it is to Ulysses that we owe the fall of those lofty towers,

<!-- page 315 -->

which threatened confederate Greece more than ten years
with destruction. A circumspect and sagacious valor is as
much superior to a thoughtless and impetuous courage as
Minerva is to Mars; let us, therefore, before we engage in this
war, inquire upon what grounds it is undertaken. I am willing
to incur any danger; but it is fit I should first learn from
Idomeneus whether his war is just, against whom it is waged,
and on what forces he builds his hopes of success."</p>

<p>"When we arrived at this coast," replied Idomeneus, "we
found it inhabited by a savage people, who lived wild in the
forests, subsisting upon such animals as they could kill by
hunting, and such fruits and herbage as the seasons produced
without culture. These people, who were called Mandurians,
being terrified at the sight of our vessels and our arms, fled to
the mountains. But as our soldiers were curious to see the
country, and were frequently led far into it in the pursuit of
their game, they met with some of the fugitives, and were addressed
by their chief to this effect: 'We have abandoned the
pleasant borders of the sea, that you might possess them, and
nothing remains for us but mountains that are almost inaccessible:
it is, therefore, but equitable, that of these mountains
you should leave us the peaceable possession. You are fallen
into our hands, a wandering, dispersed, and defenceless party,
and we could now destroy you, without leaving to your companions
a possibility of discovering your fate; but we will not
dip our hands in the blood of those who, though strangers,
partake of one common nature with ourselves. Go then, in
peace! Remember that you are indebted for your lives to our
humanity, and that a people whom you have stigmatized with
the name of savages and barbarians, have given you this lesson
of moderation and generosity.'</p>

<p>"Our people, thus dismissed by the barbarians, came back
to the camp, and told what had happened. The soldiers took
fire at the relation; they disdained that Cretans should owe
their lives to a company of wandering savages, who, in their
opinion, were more like bears than men: they went out to the
chase in greater numbers and better armed.  They soon fell in

<!-- page 316 -->

with a party of the natives, and immediately attacked them.
The contest was bloody; the arrows flew on each side, as thick
as hail in a storm, and the savages were at length driven back
to their mountains, whither our people did not dare to pursue
them.</p>

<p>"A short time afterwards they sent two of the wisest of their
old men to me, demanding peace. They brought me such
presents as they had&mdash;the skins of wild beasts and the fruits of
the country. After they had given them, they addressed me
in these terms:</p>

<p>" 'We hold, as thou seest, O king, in one hand the sword,
and an olive-branch in the other. Here are peace and war;
make your choice. Peace has the preference in our estimation;
it is for peace that we have yielded to thy people the
delightful borders of the sea, where the sun renders the earth
fertile, and matures the most delicious fruits. Peace is still
more sweet than these fruits; and for peace we have retired to
the mountains that are covered with eternal snow, where spring
is decorated with no flowers, and autumn is enriched with no
fruit. We abhor that brutality, which, under the specious
names of ambition and glory, desolates the earth and destroys
mankind. If thou hast placed glory in carnage and desolation,
we do not envy, but pity the delusion, and beseech the gods
that our minds may never be perverted by so dreadful a
phrensy. If the sciences which the Greeks learn with so much
assiduity, and the politeness of which they boast with such a
conscious superiority, inspire them with desires so sanguinary
and injurious, we think ourselves happy to be without these
advantages. It will be our glory to continue ignorant and unpolished,
but just, humane, faithful, and disinterested; to be
content with little, and to despise the false delicacy which
makes it necessary to have much. We prize nothing but
health, frugality, freedom, and vigor both of body and of
mind; we cultivate only the love of virtue, the fear of the
gods, benevolence to our neighbors, zeal for our friends, integrity
to the world, moderation in prosperity, fortitude in distress,
courage to speak truth in every situation, and a just abhorrence

<!-- page 317 -->

and contempt of flattery. Such are the people whom
we offer thee as neighbors and allies. If thou shalt be so
blinded by the gods in their displeasure as to reject them, experience
shall teach thee, when it is too late, that those whose
moderation inclines them to peace, are most to be dreaded
when compelled to war.'</p>

<p>"While these old men were speaking, I regarded them with
a fixed yet unwearied attention. Their beards were long and
neglected; their hair was shorter, but white as snow; their
eyebrows were thick, and their eyes piercing; their look was
firm, their speech deliberate and commanding, and their deportment
simple and ingenuous. They were covered only
with some furs, which, being thrown loosely over them, were
fastened with a knot on the shoulder, and discovered muscles
of a bolder swell, and arms of more sinewy strength, than those
of our wrestlers. I told these two envoys that I was desirous
of peace. We settled several articles of a treaty between us,
with an honest intention to fulfil them, which we called upon
the gods to witness, and having made them presents in my
turn, I dismissed them.</p>

<p>"The gods, however, who had driven me from a kingdom
that I was born to inherit, continued to persecute me in this.
Our hunting-parties that were at this time out, and were consequently
ignorant of our treaty, met a numerous body of these
poor savages, who had accompanied their envoys, as they were
returning home on the very day that the treaty had been concluded;
and falling upon them with great fury, killed many of
them, and pursued the rest into the woods. The war was thus
kindled. The barbarians now believe that we are not to be
trusted, either upon our promise or our oath.</p>

<p>"That they may be the better able to take the field against
us, they have called in to their assistance the Locrians, the
Apulians, the Lucanians, the Brutians, and the people of Crotona,
Neritum, and Brundusium. The Lucanians come to
battle with chariots that are armed with scythes. The Apulians
are covered with the skins of the wild beasts they have
slain, and are armed with maces that are covered with knots,

<!-- page 318 -->

and stuck full of iron spikes; they are of gigantic stature, and
the laborious exercises to which they are addicted render them
so brawny and robust, that their very appearance is terrifying.
The Locrians, who came anciently from Greece, have not yet
lost all traces of their origin; they are less savage than the
rest, but they have added to the regular discipline of the Greek
troops the native vigor of the barbarians, and the habitual
hardiness produced by constant activity and coarse fare, which
render them invincible. They are armed with a long sword,
and, for defence, carry a light buckler of wicker-work covered
with skins. The Brutians are as light of foot as a roe, so that
the grass scarcely bends under them; nor is it easy to trace
their steps even upon the sand. They rush upon their enemies
almost before they are seen, and again vanish with the
same rapidity. The Crotonians are formidable for their archery.
They carry such bows as few Greeks are able to bend;
and if ever they should become candidates in the Olympic
games, they would certainly carry the prize. Their arrows are
dipped in the juice of some poisonous herb, which is said to
grow upon the banks of Avernus, and the wound which they
give is mortal. As for the inhabitants of Neritum, Brundusium,
and Messapia, they have nothing but corporeal strength and instinctive
courage. They make their onset with a yell which of
all sounds is the most dreadful. They make no bad use of the
sling, from which they discharge a shower of stones that darkens
the air; but they fight altogether without order. You
now know the origin of the war, and the nature of our enemies."</p>

<p>After this explanation, Telemachus, who was impatient for
battle, thought only of taking the field. Mentor again perceived
and restrained his ardor.</p>

<p>"How comes it," said he to Idomeneus, "that the Locrians,
who are themselves of Grecian origin, have taken arms for the
barbarians against the Greeks? How comes it that so many
colonies flourish upon the same coast, that are not threatened
with the same hostilities? You say, O Idomeneus, that the
gods are not yet weary of persecuting you; and I say, that

<!-- page 319 -->

they have not yet completed your instruction. All the misfortunes
that you have suffered hitherto have not taught you what
should be done to prevent a war. What you have yourself
related of the candid integrity of these barbarians, is sufficient
to show that you might have shared with them the blessings of
peace; but pride and arrogance necessarily bring on the calamities
of war. You might have changed hostages, and it would
have been easy to have sent some persons of proper authority
with the ambassadors, to have procured them a safe return.
After the war had broken out, you might have put an end to
it by representing to the sufferers that they were attacked by
a party of your people, who could have received no intelligence
of the treaty which had been just concluded. Such sureties
ought to have been given them as they should have required,
and your subjects should have been enjoined to keep the treaty
inviolate, under the sanction of the severest punishments. But
what further has happened since the war broke out?"</p>

<p>"I thought it beneath us," said Idomeneus, "to make any
application to these barbarians, when they had precipitately
called together all their fighting men, and solicited the assistance
of all the neighboring nations, to which they necessarily
rendered us hateful and suspected. I thought the best thing I
could do was suddenly to seize certain passes in the mountains
that were not sufficiently secured, which was accordingly done;
and this has put the barbarians very much in our power. I
have erected towers in these passes, from which our people can
so annoy the enemy as effectually to prevent their invading
our country from the mountains, while we can enter theirs,
and ravage their principal settlements when we please. We
are thus in a condition to defend ourselves against superior
force, and keep off the almost innumerable multitude of enemies
that surround us. As to peace, it seems at present to be
impossible. We cannot abandon these towers without exposing
ourselves to invasion, and while we keep them they are
considered as fortresses, intended to reduce the natives to a
state of slavish subjection."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Mentor, "that to the wisdom of Idomeneus,

<!-- page 320 -->

truth will be most welcome without ornament and
disguise. You are superior to those who, with equal weakness
and timidity, turn away their eyes at her approach, and not
having courage to correct their faults, employ their authority
to support them. I will then freely tell you that these savages
set you a noble example when they came with propositions of
peace. Did they desire peace because they were not able to
sustain a war? Did they want either courage or strength to
take the field against you? Certainly they did not, for their
martial spirit is now equally manifest, with the number and
force of their allies. Why was not their example thought
worthy of imitation? You have been deceived into misfortune
by false notions, both of honor and shame. You have been
afraid of making your enemies proud; but you have, without
scruple, made them powerful, by an arrogant and injurious
conduct, which has united innumerable nations against you.
To what purpose are these towers, of which you have so pompously
displayed the advantages, but to reduce all the surrounding
nations to the necessity, either of perishing themselves,
or of destroying you to preserve their freedom? You
erected these towers for your security, but they are really the
source of your danger.</p>

<p>"A kingdom is best fortified by justice, moderation, and
good faith, by which neighboring States are convinced that
their territories will never be usurped. The strongest walls
may give way, by various accidents, which no sagacity can
foresee; the best conducted war may be rendered unsuccessful,
by the mere caprice and inconsistency of Fortune; but the
love and confidence of neighboring States that have long experienced
your moderation, will surround you with bulwarks
against which no force can prevail, and which temerity will
seldom attack. If you shall be assailed by the folly and injustice
of some neighboring power, all the rest, being interested
in your preservation, will unite in your defence. The assistance
of united nations, who would find it their interest to support
yours, would give you advantages greatly superior to any that
you can hope from these boasted towers, which can only render

<!-- page 321 -->

irremediable those evils they were intended to obviate. If you
had been careful, at first, to prevent jealousy in the neighboring
States, your rising city would have flourished in peace, and
you would have become the arbiter of all the nations in Hesperia.</p>

<p>"Let us, however, at present, consider only how the future
can be made to atone for the past.</p>

<p>"You say, there are many colonies settled upon this coast
from Greece. These, surely, must be disposed to succor you.
They cannot have forgotten the name of Minos, the son of Jupiter,
nor your achievements at the siege of Troy, where you
often signalized yourself among the Grecian princes in the
cause of Greece. Why do you not engage these colonies in
your interest?"</p>

<p>"These colonies," replied Idomeneus, "have all resolved to
stand neuter. They have, indeed, some inclination to assist
me; but the magnificent appearance of our city, while it is yet
rising from its foundations, has alarmed them. The Greeks, as
well as the rest of our neighbors, are apprehensive that we
have designs upon their liberty. They imagine that after having
subdued the barbarians of the mountains, we shall push
our ambition further. In a word, all are against us. Those
even who do not openly attack us, secretly wish to see us humbled;
and jealousy has left us without a single ally."</p>

<p>"This is, indeed, a strange extremity," said Mentor. "By
attempting to appear powerful, you have subverted your
power; and, while you are the object of enmity and terror to
your neighbors from without, your strength is exhausted within,
to maintain a war which this enmity and terror have made
necessary. You are, indeed, unfortunate to have incurred this
calamity, but still more unfortunate to have derived from it but
half the wisdom it might have taught you. Is it necessary you
should lose a second kingdom before you learn to foresee those
evils which expose you to such a loss? Leave your present
difficulties, however, to me; tell me only what Grecian cities
there are upon this coast."</p>

<p>"The principal," said Idomeneus, "is Tarentum, which was

<!-- page 322 -->

founded about three years ago by Phalanthus. A great number
of boys were born in Laconia, of women that forgot their
husbands during the Trojan war. When these husbands returned,
these women renounced their children to atone for their
crime. The boys, being thus destitute both of father and
mother, abandoned themselves, as they grew up, to the most
criminal excesses. The laws being executed against them with
great severity, they formed themselves into a body under Phalanthus,
a bold, enterprising, and ambitious chief, who, by
various artifices, having gained the hearts of the young men,
brought them to this coast, where they have made another
Lacedemon of Tarentum. On another spot, Philoctetes, who
gained so much renown at the siege of Troy by bringing
thither the arrows of Hercules, has raised the walls of Petilia,
less powerful, indeed, than Tarentum, but governed with much
greater wisdom. And, at a little distance, there is Metapontum,
a city which the Pylians have founded under the direction
of Nestor."</p>

<p>"How!" said Mentor, "have you Nestor in Hesperia, and
could you not engage him in your interest?&mdash;Nestor, under
whose eye you have so often fought before the walls of Troy,
and who was then your friend, engaged in a common cause,
and endeared by mutual danger?" "I have lost him," said
Idomeneus, "by the artifices of these people, who are barbarians
only in name; for they have had the cunning to persuade
him that I intended to make myself tyrant of Hesperia." "We
will undeceive him," replied Mentor. "Telemachus saw him
at Pylos, before he founded this colony, and before we undertook
to search the world for Ulysses. By Nestor, Ulysses cannot
be forgotten; and he must still remember the tenderness
which he expressed for Telemachus his son. Our principal
care must be to remove his suspicions. This war has been
kindled by the jealousy you have excited in your neighbors,
and by removing that jealousy it will be extinguished. Once
more I entreat you to leave the management of this affair to
me."</p>

<p>Idomeneus was so moved by this address of Mentor, that he

<!-- page 323 -->

was at first unable to reply, and could only clasp him to his
breast in an ecstasy of speechless tenderness. At last, though
not without difficulty, he found words: "Thou art, O sage,
the messenger of heaven! I feel thy wisdom, and renounce
my errors; yet I confess that the same freedom in another
would have provoked my anger. Thou only couldst have persuaded
me to seek for peace. I had resolved to perish or to
conquer, but it is better I should be guided by thy counsel
than by my own passions. How happy is Telemachus, who,
with such a guide, can never wander as I have wandered! I
trust, with implicit confidence, to thee: to thee the gods have
communicated celestial wisdom, nor could the counsel of
Minerva have been more salutary than thine. Go, then;
promise, conclude, concede whatever my power can fulfil,
ratify, or give up: all that Mentor shall do, Idomeneus shall
approve."</p>

<p>While Idomeneus was still speaking, they were alarmed by
a sudden and confused noise,&mdash;the rattling of chariots, the
neighing of horses, the shouts of men, and the sound of the
trumpet. The people cried out that the enemy had made a
detour, and had come down, without attempting the passes
that Idomeneus had secured, to besiege Salentum. The old
men and the women were struck with consternation. "Alas!"
said they, "have we then quitted our native country, the dear
and fertile plains of Crete, and followed an unfortunate prince,
through all the dangers of the seas, to found a new city, which,
like Troy, shall be reduced to ashes!" From the walls, which
were scarcely finished, there could be seen in the vast plain
below, the casques, cuirasses, and shields of the enemy, which
glittered in the sun, and almost dazzled the sight. Their
spears covered the earth to the horizon, like the rich harvests<sup id="t_ref130"><a href="#t_en130">130</a></sup>
which Ceres, under the summer's sun, ripens in the fields of
Enna,<sup id="t_ref131"><a href="#t_en131">131</a></sup> to reward the labor of the husbandman.  Among these

<!-- page 324 -->

were discovered the chariots armed with scythes; and all the
different nations in the confederacy were, by their arms and
habits, easily distinguished.</p>

<p>Mentor, that he might view them to greater advantage,
ascended a high tower; and Idomeneus and Telemachus followed
him. They presently discovered Philoctetes on one
side, and Nestor, who was easily known by his venerable age,
with his son Pisistratus, on the other. "How is this!" cried
Mentor; "you supposed that Philoctetes and Nestor would
content themselves with affording you no assistance; but
you see that they are in arms against you, and, if I am not
deceived, those other troops, that come on with so deliberate
a pace and in such perfect order, are Lacedemonians, under
the command of Phalanthus. All are against you; there is
not a single nation upon the coast of which you have not
made an enemy, without intending it."</p>

<p>Mentor, the moment he had made this discovery, descended
hastily from the tower, and went towards the gate of the city,
on that side towards which the enemy advanced: he immediately
ordered the sentinel to open it; and Idomeneus, astonished
at the commanding dignity of his deportment, did not
dare to ask his design. He went out at the gate, and, making
a sign with his hand that nobody should follow him, advanced
directly towards the front of the enemy, who were astonished
to see a man, wholly unattended, present himself before them.
While he was yet at a distance, he held out to them the branch
of an olive, as a token of peace, and when he was near enough
to be heard, he demanded that their chiefs should be assembled.
As soon as they were collected together, he addressed them in
these terms:</p>

<p>"I see before me the strength of every nation that flourishes
in this happy country, and I know that the generous purpose
of this assembly is the defence of a common cause of liberty.
I honor your zeal; but permit me to point out an easy way
by which your liberty and honor may be preserved, without
the effusion of blood. Among other princes in this assembly
I see Nestor. Thy years and wisdom, O Nestor, have acquainted

<!-- page 325 -->

thee with the calamities of war, even when it is undertaken
with justice, and is favored by the gods. War is
the most dreadful of all evils by which heaven has afflicted
man. Thou canst never forget what was suffered by the
Greeks, during the ten years they spent before the walls of
Troy&mdash;what divisions among their chiefs! what caprices of
fortune! what carnage from the hand of Hector! what calamity
in distant cities, during the long absence of their kings! and
what misfortunes at their return!&mdash;how some were shipwrecked
on the promontory of Caphareus; how some perished,
with circumstances of yet more horror, in the arms of their
wives. The gods, doubtless, in their wrath, suffered them to
be seduced by the false splendor of that expedition; may they
never, O people of Hesperia, distinguish you by so fatal a
victory! Troy, indeed, is in ashes; but it would have been
better for Greece if she had still flourished in all her glory
and Paris had still enjoyed, with Helen, such pleasures as are
permitted to infamy and guilt. Do not you, O Philoctetes
who were so long wretched and abandoned in the isle of Lemnos,
fear the like calamities from a like war. Have not the
people of Laconia suffered equally by the long absence of their
princes, their captains, and their soldiers, who went to the
siege of Troy? And is there a single Grecian, at this hour,
on the coast of Hesperia, that is not a fugitive from his country,
in consequence of that fatal expedition?"</p>

<p>During this address. Mentor advanced towards the Pylians;
and Nestor, recollecting his features, came forward to salute
him. "It is with great pleasure," said he, "that I once more
give my hand to Mentor. It is many years since I first saw
you in Phocis; you were then only fifteen years old, but I
perceived the dawning of that wisdom that has been so conspicuous
to the world. Tell us, however, by what chance you
came hither; and what expedient you have thought of, to
prevent a war? Idomeneus has compelled us to attack him.
We demand only peace, which is our interest and our desire;
but it is impossible that peace should be secured till he is
destroyed.  He has violated all his engagements with the

<!-- page 326 -->

neighboring people; and if we were now to conclude a treaty
with him, it would serve no other end than to dissolve our
confederacy, upon which alone our safety depends. He has
sufficiently manifested his ambition to reduce every other nation
to slavery; and we have no means to establish our own
liberty, but the subversion of his new kingdom. His want of
public faith has reduced us to the alternative of either putting
an end to his power or of receiving his yoke. If you can
show that he may still be trusted with safety, and assure us
of peace in consequence of a treaty, all the nations that you
see here confederated against him will gladly lay down their
arms, and we will confess that your wisdom is greater than
ours."</p>

<p>"You know," replied Mentor, "that Ulysses has intrusted
his son Telemachus to my care. The young man, impatient
to discover what had become of his father, went first to Pylos,
where you received him with all the kindness that he had
reason to expect from the friend of his father; and when he
left, you appointed your own son to conduct him on his way.
He afterwards undertook many distant voyages by sea. He
has visited Sicily and Egypt, and the islands of Cyprus and
Crete. The winds, or rather the gods, have at length thrown
him upon this coast, as he was returning to Ithaca. We are
just come in time to spare you the horrors of another war; for
you shall not now trust in Idomeneus, but in the son of Ulysses
and myself, for the fulfilling of whatever shall be stipulated in
a treaty of peace."</p>

<p>During this conference between Mentor and Nestor, in the
midst of the confederate troops, Idomeneus and Telemachus,
with all the Cretans under arms, were spectators of the scene
from the walls of Salentum. They were very attentive to discover
in what manner Mentor's discourse was received; and
wished they could have been present at the conference of two
men, so venerable for age and wisdom. Nestor had always
been considered as superior to the other princes of Greece in
experimental knowledge and graceful elocution. It was he
that restrained the anger of Achilles, the pride of Agamemnon,

<!-- page 327 -->

the ferocity of Ajax, and the precipitate courage of Diomedes.
Persuasion, sweet as honey, distilled from his lips:
the sound of his voice alone was sufficient to excite attention;
when Nestor spoke, surrounding heroes were silent, and he
alone had the power of soothing discord into peace. He began
now to feel the chilling influence of age; but his words
were still forcible and still sweet. He frequently related past
events, that youth might be instructed by his experience; and
though his speech was somewhat slow, yet his narratives were
pleasing.</p>

<p>But this venerable sage, so admired by all Greece, seemed
to lose all his eloquence and all his dignity, from the moment
that he appeared in competition with Mentor. In comparison
with him, he seemed to be withered and depressed by age; for
the vigor and activity of Mentor appeared to have suffered no injury
from time. In the words of Mentor, though they were grave
and simple, there was a vivacity and authority which began to
be wanting in those of Nestor. What he said was short, precise,
and nervous. He made no repetitions, and he spoke only
to the point in question. If it was necessary to mention the
same thing more than once, either to inculcate or to persuade,
it was always by some happy simile or allusion. He had also
the art of insinuating truth by a kind of nameless complaisance
and good-humor, when it was necessary to accommodate himself
to particular dispositions and capacities. There was something
in the appearance of these persons that strongly excited
veneration and love among the multitude that surrounded
them.</p>

<p>The forces that were confederated against Salentum crowded
one upon another, that they might get a nearer view of their
persons, and catch up some fragment of their discourse. Idomeneus,
and the people that were with him, fixed their eyes
upon them with the utmost eagerness and ardor, to discover
the purport of what they said by their gestures and countenance.</p>

<p>Compelled by his impatience, which he could no longer
restrain, Telemachus disengaged himself from the crowd, and

<!-- page 328 -->

running to the gate by which Mentor had gone out, commanded
it to be opened with a tone of authority which was immediately
obeyed. Idomeneus, who believed him to be still standing at
his side, was in a few moments surprised to see him running
across the plain, and not far from the place where Nestor stood.
Nestor immediately knew him, and advanced, with haste in his
looks, but with a slow and heavy pace, to receive him. Telemachus
threw himself on his neck, and held him locked in his
arms, without power to speak. At last he cried out: "O my
father, I fear not to claim you by the dearest tie; the loss of
him from whom I derived my birth, and the parental kindness
which I have experienced in you, give me a right to call you
by this tender name. You are a father whom I am again permitted
to embrace. O might I once more be permitted thus
to embrace Ulysses! If any thing can atone for his loss, it is
the finding of his wisdom, his virtues, and his tenderness in
you."</p>

<p>The affectionate ardor of his address melted Nestor into
tears, and he was touched with a secret pleasure at perceiving
the same expression of tender sensibility in his young friend,
which gave new grace to his countenance. The beauty, the
sweetness, and the noble confidence of this young stranger,
who had without precaution ventured among so many enemies,
astonished the allies. "Is not this the son of the old man,"
said they, "who came to speak with Nestor? We certainly
see the same wisdom at two ages. In one of them it is only
in blossom, in the other it is matured into fruit."</p>

<p>Mentor, who had with great pleasure observed the tenderness
with which Nestor received Telemachus, availed himself
of a disposition so favorable to his purpose. "Here is the son
of Ulysses," said he, "so dear to all Greece, and so tenderly
beloved by you. I offer him as a hostage, as the dearest
pledge that can be given, for the accomplishment of whatever
shall be promised on the part of Idomeneus. You cannot suppose
that I would aggravate the loss of the father by that of
the son, or expose myself to the reproaches of Penelope for
having sacrificed her child to the ambition of the new king of

<!-- page 329 -->

Salentum. With this pledge, ye nations of Hesperia, voluntarily
offered by himself, and sent by the gods that are lovers
of amity, I begin my propositions for establishing a lasting
peace."</p>

<p>At the name of peace, a confused murmur was heard spreading
from rank to rank,&mdash;an inarticulate expression of anger,
which was with difficulty restrained; for all that were present
thought every moment lost by which the battle was delayed.
They imagined that Mentor had no design but to soften their
resentment and rob them of their prey. The Mandurians, in
particular, could not bear to think of being again deceived.
As they feared the eloquence of Mentor would gain over their
allies, they frequently attempted to interrupt him. They began
to suspect all the Greeks that were in the field. Mentor, who
perceived this suspicion, immediately resolved to increase it,
that he might weaken the confederacy by dividing it into
factions.</p>

<p>"I confess," said he, "that the Mandurians have reason to
complain, and to insist upon satisfaction for the injury they
have suffered; but is it not equally reasonable that the ancient
inhabitants of the country should regard all Greeks, who have
established colonies upon this coast, with suspicion and malignity?
The Greeks, therefore, ought to maintain a firm union
among themselves, that they may be able to compel a proper
treatment from the nations that surround them, although they
ought not, upon any pretence, to usurp their territory. I know
that Idomeneus has unfortunately given sufficient cause of
jealousy, but this jealousy may easily be removed. Telemachus
and myself are ready to become hostages for his future good
faith, and to continue in your power till his stipulations shall
be fulfilled. I know," said he, addressing himself to the Mandurians,
"that you are provoked at the Cretans having seized
the passes of the mountains by surprise, and secured to themselves
the power of entering at pleasure the country to which
you have retired, that you might leave them the level country
upon the sea-coast. These passes the Cretans have fortified by
high towers, strongly garrisoned. These towers, then, I suppose,

<!-- page 330 -->

are the immediate cause of the war: if there is any other,
let it be assigned."</p>

<p>The chief of the Mandurians then advanced, and spoke to
the following effect: "Whatever is the cause of the war, we
have done every thing that was possible to avoid it. The gods
are our witnesses that we made use of every art to keep peace
among us, till she was driven away by the restless ambition of
the Cretans, and the perfidy that made it impossible to trust
them, even on their oath. These infatuated people have
reduced us to the fatal extremity of perishing ourselves, or
destroying them. While they continue in possession of the
passes they have fortified, we shall always apprehend a design
to invade our territory, and enslave our persons. If they had
a sincere desire to live at peace with their neighbors, they
would rest satisfied with the country which we have voluntarily
ceded to them; they would have formed no ambitious
designs against the liberty of others, and, consequently, could
never be solicitous to secure the avenues by which their territories
could be invaded. But wise as thou art, O full of days,
thou knowest them not; it is by misfortune only that we know
them. Cease then, O beloved of heaven, to prevent so just
and necessary a war, without which Hesperia must forever
despair of peace. They are an ungrateful, a perfidious, an inhuman
people, whom the gods have sent among us in their
anger, to interrupt our tranquillity and punish our offences.
But the gods, when they have punished, will avenge us, and
our enemies also shall have experience that they are just."</p>

<p>At these words the whole assembly was moved. It seemed
as if Mars and Bellona were passing from rank to rank, and
kindling in every bosom that rage of war which Mentor had
labored to extinguish. But he addressed himself again to the
assembly in these terms:</p>

<p>"If I offered promises only, they might reasonably be
rejected; but what I offer you is certain and immediate advantage.
If you are not content to receive Telemachus and
myself as hostages, twelve of the noblest and bravest Cretans
shall be delivered into your hands. It is, however, but just

<!-- page 331 -->

that hostages should also be given on your part, for Idomeneus,
though he desires peace, desires it without fear and
without meanness. He desires peace upon the same principles
on which you say you desire it&mdash;wisdom and moderation;
not because he desires to repose in voluptuous tranquillity, or
is terrified by a prospect of the dangers of war. He is, like
you, ready to perish or to conquer; but he prefers peace to the
most splendid victory. He disdains the fear of being vanquished;
but he confesses that he fears to be unjust, and is
not ashamed to make an atonement for his faults. He offers
you peace with the sword in his hand. But he would not
haughtily impose it upon his own conditions, for he sets no
value upon a compulsory treaty. He desires a peace, in which
all parties shall be content; which shall put an end to all
jealousies, appease all resentment, and remove all distrust.
His sentiments are just what you would wish them to be, and
nothing is necessary but to convince you of this truth, which
would not be difficult, if you would hear me without prejudice
and passion.</p>

<p>"Hear then, ye nations, distinguished by valor; and hear,
ye chiefs, whom wisdom has united, what I shall now offer on
the part of Idomeneus. It is not just that he should invade
the territory of his neighbors, neither is it just that his territory
should be invaded. He consents that the towers by which
he has fortified the passes should be garrisoned by neutral
troops. You, Nestor, and you, Philoctetes, are of Grecian
origin yet in this quarrel you have declared against Idomeneus:
you cannot, therefore, be suspected of partiality to his
interests; you take part only in the common cause&mdash;the peace
and liberty of Hesperia. To you, then, the passes which have
been the cause of the war shall be confided. You have not
less interest in preventing the original natives of Hesperia from
destroying Salentum, a new colony like your own, than in preventing
Idomeneus from usurping the possessions of his neighbors.
Hold, then, the balance between them, and instead of
destroying, by fire and sword, a people whom you ought to
cherish and to love, secure to yourselves the glory of acting at

<!-- page 332 -->

once as mediators and judges. You will, perhaps, tell me that
these conditions are too good to be fulfilled, but I shall abundantly
satisfy you that Idomeneus is sincere.</p>

<p>"The hostages which I have already mentioned shall be
reciprocally given and detained till the passes shall be put into
your hands. When the security, not only of Salentum, but of
all Hesperia, is at your discretion, will you not be content?
Whom then can you distrust but yourselves? You do not
dare to confide in Idomeneus: but as a proof that his intention
is honest, he is ready to confide in you. He is ready to trust
you with the quiet, the life, and the liberty of himself and his
people. If it is true that you desire only an equitable and
lasting peace, such a peace is now offered you upon terms that
leave you no pretence to reject it. Let me, however, once
more caution you against imagining that Idomeneus has made
this proposal from fear. His motives are prudence and equity,
and conscious of the rectitude of his intention he will be under
no concern about your opinion, though you should impute that
to weakness which he knows to proceed from virtue. He was,
in the beginning, guilty of some faults, and he thinks it an
honor to acknowledge them by the offer of such terms as anticipate
your wishes. He who hopes that he shall be able to
hide his faults by affecting to support them with arrogance and
pride, discovers the most deplorable weakness, the most despicable
vanity, and the grossest ignorance of his own interest;
but he who acknowledges his fault to an enemy, and offers
reparation, gives the strongest proof that he can never commit
them again, and displays a wisdom and fortitude which, if
peace is rejected, must make his enmity formidable. Beware,
then, that the fault in the present quarrel does not become
yours. If you reject justice and peace when they sue for
acceptance, be assured that the cause of peace and justice will
be avenged. Idomeneus, who has just reason to fear the displeasure
of the gods, will engage them in his favor against you.
Telemachus and myself will take up arms in his defence, and I
call the powers both of heaven and of hell to witness, that the
proposals which I have now offered you are just."</p>

<!-- page 333 -->

<p>Mentor then lifted up the olive-branch which he held in his
hand, that the distant multitude might behold the symbol of
peace. The chiefs, who saw him near, were astonished and
dazzled with the celestial radiance that sparkled in his eyes,
and perceived in him something majestic and commanding
beyond all that fancy had given to created beings. The magic
of his eloquence, at once so forcible and so sweet, had, as it
were, stolen away their hearts; its power was secret, but irresistible,
like that of the mysterious spells which, in the dead
silence of the night, arrest the moon and the stars of heaven,
calm the raging of the sea, command the winds and the
waves to be still, and suspend the most rapid rivers in their
course.<sup id="t_ref132"><a href="#t_en132">132</a></sup></p>

<p>He appeared, in the midst of this rude, impetuous multitude,
like Bacchus surrounded by tigers, whose ferocity had been
charmed away by the sweetness of his voice, till they expressed
their fondness by their caresses, and their submission by licking
his feet. At first, the whole assembly was silent. The
chiefs looked upon each other, unable to oppose the eloquence
of Mentor, and wondering who he could be. Every eye of the
surrounding multitude was immovably fixed upon him. Every
tongue was held silent, for fear he should have still something
to say, which the words of another might prevent from being
heard. Though they conceived nothing could be added to
what he had said already, yet they wished that he had not
been silent so soon. His words might be said to be engraven
on their hearts. His elocution made him not only believed,
but beloved, and held in suspense all the faculties of those that
heard him, who scarcely dared even to breathe lest they should
lose the least word that issued from his lips.</p>

<p>This silence was succeeded by a kind of low murmur, which
gradually diffused itself through the whole assembly. It was
no longer the confused sound of inarticulate indignation, but
the whisper of gentleness and complacency, which were also
silently expressed in every countenance. The Mandurians, who

<!-- page 334 -->

had been so lately transported with rage, now let their weapons
fall from their hands. The fierce Phalanthus, with his Lacedemonians,
wondered to find themselves softened into kindness.
The rest of the united nations began to sigh after the peace
which had been held up before them. Philoctetes, whose
sensibility had been increased by misfortune, could not refrain
from tears. Nestor, who was so transported with admiration
and delight at the discourse of Mentor that he was unable to
speak, embraced him with ineffable tenderness; and the whole
multitude cried out together, as if by a signal: "O stranger,
thy wisdom has disarmed us!  Peace!  Peace!"</p>

<p>In the first interval of silence, Nestor attempted to speak;
but the troops, fearing he might start some difficulty, again
cried out, with the utmost impatience: "Peace! Peace!" The
chiefs found no way of putting them to silence but by joining
in the exclamation.</p>

<p>Nestor, perceiving that a set discourse could not be heard,
contented himself with saying: "You see, O Mentor, what
wonders the words of a good man can produce. When wisdom
and virtue speak, every passion is calm. Our resentment, however
just, is changed into friendship, and our impatience for
war into a desire of perpetual peace. The peace that you have
offered, we accept." The chiefs at the same time stretched out
their hands in token of their consent.</p>

<p>Mentor now ran towards the gate of Salentum to get it
opened, and to acquaint Idomeneus that he might leave the
city without fear. In the mean time, Nestor went up to Telemachus
and embraced him. "My amiable young friend," said
he, "thy father was the wisest of all the princes of Greece;
mayst thou be favored with equal wisdom and with better
fortune. The similitude of your persons is great, and the remembrance
of Ulysses, which that has revived, contributed to
soften our resentment."</p>

<p>Phalanthus, though he was by nature fierce and unfeeling,
and though he had never seen Ulysses, was, notwithstanding,
touched at his misfortunes and those of his son. The chiefs,
gathering around Telemachus, were pressing him to relate his

<!-- page 335 -->

adventures, when Mentor returned with Idomeneus and the
Cretan youths who followed in his train.</p>

<p>At the sight of Idomeneus the resentment of the confederate
nations began to revive, but Mentor extinguished the fire before
it broke out. "Why do we delay," said he, "to conclude
this sacred alliance, which the powers of heaven shall witness
and defend? May the gods avenge its violation, by whomsoever
it shall be violated! And may all the horrors of war,
averted from the faithful and the innocent, descend upon the
perjured and execrable head of him whose ambition shall dare
to trample upon the sacred rights of this alliance! May he be
detested both in heaven and upon earth; may he derive no
advantage from his perfidy; may the infernal furies, in the
most horrid forms, excite in his breast everlasting rage and
despair: let him perish, without hope of burial; let his limbs
be the prey of vultures and of dogs: when he descends to the
infernal regions, may the gulf of Tartarus receive him; and
may he there suffer severer torments than those of Tantalus,
Ixion, and the Dan&auml;ides, forever and forever! But may this
peace rather remain unshaken, like the mountains of Atlas that
sustain the skies; may it be revered by every nation upon the
earth, and its blessings descend from generation to generation!
May the names of those who have made it, be held in admiration
and love by our latest posterity; let it stand as a model
for every peace that shall be hereafter founded upon equity
and good faith; and let all nations that desire to secure happiness
by unanimity, follow the example of the people of
Hesperia!"</p>

<p>Idomeneus and the rest of the princes then ratified the
peace, upon the conditions that had been proposed, by an oath.
Twelve hostages were interchanged between them. Telemachus,
by his own choice, was one of those given by Idomeneus;
but the allies would not consent that Mentor should be another,
insisting that he should remain with Idomeneus, that he might
answer for his conduct, and superintend his council, till his
engagements should be perfectly fulfilled. A hundred heifers
as white as snow, and a hundred bulls of the same color,

having their horns gilt and adorned with garlands of flowers,
were then sacrificed between the camp and the city. The
bellowing of the victims that fell under the sacred knife resounded
from the neighboring hills: their blood flowed in a
smoking torrent on every side. The most exquisite wines
were poured abundantly in libations to the gods. The aruspices
consulted the entrails, still panting with the remains of
life. The priests burnt an incense upon the altar, which rose
in a cloud of fragrance, and perfumed all the plain.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the soldiers on both sides forgot that
they had been enemies, and began to entertain each other with
their adventures. They resigned themselves to a pleasing
relaxation after their labors, and tasted the sweets of peace by
anticipation. Many of those who followed Idomeneus to the
siege of Troy, recollected the soldiers of Nestor, with whom
they had fought in the same cause. They embraced each
other with great affection; and mutually related all that happened
to them after they had laid the magnificent city, that
was the glory of Asia, in ruins. They laid themselves down
upon the grass, crowned themselves with flowers, and rejoiced
over the wine which had been brought in large vases from the
city, to celebrate so happy a day.</p>

<p>During this scene of cheerfulness and amity. Mentor cried
out, as by a sudden impulse: "Henceforth, O ye kings and
leaders, these assembled nations, although disguised by various
names, and governed by different chiefs, shall be one people.
Thus do the gods, who love the creatures of their power,
delight to become the bond of union between them. What is
the race of man, but one family widely scattered upon the
earth? All men by nature are brothers, and should be mutually
endeared by a brother's love. Accursed be those impious
barbarians who seek for glory in the kindred blood,
which differs but in name from their own!</p>

<p>"War, indeed, is sometimes necessary; but the necessity of
war is the reproach of man. Let ambitious royalty no more
pretend that war is to be desired as the means of glory.
Nothing can be glorious that is inhuman.  He that would

<!-- page 337 -->

acquire glory at the expense of humanity, is a monster, and
not a man. True glory cannot be thus acquired; glory is
nothing more than the radiance of virtue, and the virtue of a
prince is moderation and benevolence. The incense of adulation
may be offered to the vanity and the folly of a tyrant;
but even those who offer it confess, in the secret language of
their heart, that glory is less deserved in proportion as it is
dishonestly sought. He ought to be lightly esteemed of men,
by whom men are so lightly esteemed, that, to gratify a brutal
vanity, he will deluge the earth with their blood. Happy is
the prince who loves his people, and is beloved by them; who
has confidence in his neighbors, and whose neighbors have
confidence in him; who is so far from making war against
them, that he prevents their making war against each other;
and who can excite envy in foreign States only by the happiness
which he diffuses through his own!</p>

<p>"Let your assemblies, then, O ye powers of Hesperia, be
frequent. Let all the princes that are now present, meet at
least once in three years, to confirm the present peace by a
reiterated vow; to repeat your mutual promises, and deliberate
upon your common interests. While you possess the
pleasure of this delightful country, united by the bonds of
peace, you will at home be glorious, and abroad invincible.
Discord only, that infernal fury, who ascends from hell to torment
mankind, can interrupt the felicity which is designed for
you by the gods."</p>

<p>"Our readiness to conclude a peace," replied Nestor, "is a
sufficient testimony that we have been far from engaging in a
war from vain-glory, or with an unjust design of aggrandizing
ourselves at the expense of our neighbors. But what can be
done, when, among the princes that surround us, there is one
who acts by no law but his own interest, and loses no opportunity
of invading the dominions of others? Do not imagine
that I am now speaking of Idomeneus, for to him I no
longer impute such a character: our danger now arises only
from Adrastus, the king of the Daunians. This tyrant despises
the gods, and believes that all the people upon earth are born

<!-- page 338 -->

only to contribute to his glory by their servitude. He does not
desire subjects to whom he would stand in the double relation
of king and father; he desires only slaves and worshippers, and
has directed divine honors to be paid him. The blind caprice
of fortune has hitherto prospered his undertakings. We were
hastening to attack Salentum, that we might suppress a power
in its infancy, likely to become formidable, and be at liberty to
turn our whole force against Adrastus, who is already a powerful
enemy. He has taken several towns from our allies, and
has defeated the Crotonians in two battles. He scruples at
nothing to gratify his ambition: if he can crush his enemies,
he cares not whether it be by fraud or force. He has amassed
great treasures; his troops are well disciplined and inured to
war; he has experienced officers, and is well served; he
superintends himself whatever is done by his orders. He
severely punishes the least fault, and rewards services with great
liberality. He sustains and animates his troops by his own
courage. If his conduct were regulated by equity and good
faith, he would be a most accomplished prince; but he fears
neither the vengeance of the gods nor the reproaches of conscience.
He considers reputation itself as a mere phantom,
by which weak minds only can be influenced. In his estimation,
there is no real and substantial good but the possession
of great riches, the power of inspiring terror, and of trampling
mankind under foot. His army will very soon enter our
dominions; and if we cannot acquire strength to resist him
by a general confederacy, all hope of liberty must cease forever.
It is not less the interest of Idomeneus than of the
other princes to oppose this tyrant, who will suffer nothing to
be free that his power can enslave. If we should be vanquished,
Salentum would fall with us; let us, therefore, unite
for our common defence without delay."</p>

<p>While Nestor was thus speaking they advanced towards the
city, for Idomeneus had invited all the kings and principal officers
to pass the night within the walls.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 class="center" id="tb10">BOOK X.</h2>

<p class="small">Nestor in the name of the allies, demands succors of Idomeneus against
their enemies the Daunians. Mentor, who is desirous to establish proper
regulations for the internal government of Salentum, and to employ the
people in agriculture, finds means to satisfy them with a hundred noble
Cretans, under the command of Telemachus. After their departure,
Mentor proceeds to a minute examination of the city and the port; and,
having acquainted himself with every particular, he prevails upon Idomeneus
to institute new principles of government and commerce,&mdash;to
divide his people into seven classes, distinguishing them with respect to
their rank and quality by different habits,&mdash;to retrench luxury and unnecessary
arts, and to employ the artificers in husbandry, which he brings
into just reputation.</p>

<p>THE allies had now pitched their tents, and the field was
covered with rich pavilions of all colors, in which the weary
Hesperians resigned themselves to sleep. In the mean time,
the princes and their retinue, having entered the city, were
struck with astonishment to see so many magnificent buildings,
which had risen in so short a time,&mdash;a city of which so formidable
a war had retarded neither the growth nor the decoration.</p>

<p>They admired the wisdom and vigilance of Idomeneus, who
had founded so splendid a kingdom; and concluding that the
confederacy against the Daunians would acquire great strength
by the accession of such an ally, they invited him to come into
it. Idomeneus thought it reasonable to comply, and promised
them troops.</p>

<p>But as Mentor was perfectly acquainted with all that was
necessary to render a kingdom flourishing, he had reason to
believe that the power of Idomeneus was not so great in reality
as in appearance; he therefore took him aside, and addressed
him to this effect:</p>

<p>"You see that our endeavors nave not been unsuccessful;

<!-- page 340 -->

we have secured Salentum from destruction, but you only can
raise her to glory. The government of the people depends
upon you, and it is your task to emulate the wisdom of Minos,
and show that you are worthy of your descent. I continue to
speak freely to you, supposing that you love truth and despise
flattery. While these princes were praising your magnificence,
I could but reflect in silence upon your temerity."</p>

<p>At the word temerity, Idomeneus changed countenance; his
eyes sparkled, his cheeks glowed, and he was upon the point
of interrupting Mentor by expressions of resentment. "I see,"
said Mentor, in a voice that was modest and respectful, though
not faltering or irresolute, "that the word temerity has given
you offence, and I confess, that if it had been used by any other
than myself, your displeasure would have been just; for there
is a respect due to kings; and they have a jealous sensibility,
which even those who reprove them should be careful not to
wound. To them the voice of truth is sufficiently displeasing,
however gentle the terms; but I hoped that you would permit
me to speak of your faults without a studied softness of expression;
that you would indulge me in my design of accustoming
you to hear things called by their names, and of teaching you
to discover what others think, when their respect suppresses
their thoughts. If you would not resign yourself to voluntary
deception, you must always understand more than is said, when
the subject is to your disadvantage. As to myself, I am ready
to soften my expressions, if they must be softened; but it
would surely be useful for you, that a man absolutely neutral
in your affairs, without interest, connection, or dependence,
should, when he speaks to you in private, speak plain. No
other will ever dare to do it; you will be condemned to see
truth imperfectly; you will be a stranger to her face, for she
will never appear before you but in a gaudy veil."</p>

<p>Idomeneus, whose first impatience had already subsided,
began now to be ashamed of his weakness. "You see," said
he to Mentor, "what constant flattery will do. I owe to you
the preservation of my new kingdom, and there is no truth
that I shall not think myself happy to hear from your lips.

<!-- page 341 -->

Remember, with pity, that I have been long tainted with the
poison of adulation; and that, even in my misfortunes, I was a
stranger to truth. Alas! no man has ever loved me enough
to say what he thought I should be displeased to hear."</p>

<p>The heart of Idomeneus melted as he spoke, the tears started
to his eyes, and he embraced Mentor with great tenderness.
"It is with the utmost regret" said Mentor, "that I give you
pain; but I am constrained; I cannot betray you by concealing
truth. Could you act otherwise in my place? If you have
always been deceived till now, it was because you chose to be
deceived; it was because you feared to find sincerity in those
that were to give you counsel. Have you sought those who
were most disinterested, those who were most likely to contradict
you? Have you preferred such as were least devoted to
your pleasure, and their own interest; such as appeared most
capable of opposing your passions when they were irregular,
and your sentiments when they were unjust? When you have
detected a flatterer, have you banished him from your presence?
Have you withdrawn your confidence from those whom you
suspected? You have not done what those do who love truth,
and deserve to know it. Let us now see whether you have the
fortitude to suffer the humiliation of hearing those truths by
which you are condemned.</p>

<p>"I must again tell you, that what has gained you so much
praise deserves censure. While you are surrounded with enemies,
and yet a foreigner in the country, you dream only of
adorning your new city with magnificent buildings. To this
end, as you have confessed to me, you have sacrificed your
repose and exhausted your wealth. You have thought neither
of augmenting your people, nor of cultivating the country.
Does not your power depend wholly upon a numerous people,
and a country highly cultivated for their subsistence? A long
peace is necessary, at the first establishment of a State, for
increasing the people. You ought, at present, to think of
nothing but agriculture and legislation. You have been hurried,
by a vain ambition, to the brink of a precipice. To gain
the appearance of being great, you have sapped the foundation

<!-- page 342 -->

of substantial grandeur. Let these errors be corrected without
delay; suspend all these works of idle magnificence; renounce
the pomp that will reduce your new city to ruins; release your
people from fatigue, and endeavor to facilitate marriage, by
procuring them plenty. Remember that you are a king only
in proportion as you have subjects to govern, and that the
measure of your power is not the extent of your dominions,
but the number of their inhabitants. Let your territory be
fertile, however small, and let it swarm with people at once
well disciplined and industrious; and if you can make these people
love you, you will be more powerful, more happy, and more
glorious, than all the conquerors that have ravaged the earth."</p>

<p>"What shall I do then," said Idomeneus, "with respect to
the princes that have solicited me to join the confederacy?
Shall I confess to them the weakness of my State? It is,
indeed, true, that I have neglected agriculture and even commerce,
notwithstanding the uncommon advantages of my situation.
I have thought only of making a magnificent city. But
must I, then, my dear Mentor, dishonor myself in the presence
of so many kings, by acknowledging my indiscretion? If it
must be done, I will do it, and do it readily, whatever mortification
I may suffer; for you have taught me that a king is
born for his people, owes himself wholly to them, and ought
always to prefer the public welfare to his own reputation."</p>

<p>"This sentiment," said Mentor, "is worthy the father of his
people; for this, and not for the vain magnificence of your
city, I regard you as a king deserving the name. But your
honor must be preserved, even for the advantage of your State.
Leave this to me; I will make these princes believe that you
are engaged to establish Ulysses, if he is yet living, or his son
if he is dead, in the government of his kingdom, and drive the
suitors of Penelope from Ithaca by force. They will at once
perceive that this cannot be effected without numerous troops;
and will, therefore, readily consent that you shall at first afford
them but a slight assistance against the Daunians."</p>

<p>At these words, Idomeneus appeared like a man suddenly
relieved from a burden that was crushing him by its weight.

<!-- page 343 -->

"This, indeed," said he, "my dear Mentor, will preserve my
reputation, and the honor of this rising city, by hiding its
weakness from the neighboring States. But with what appearance
of truth can it be pretended that I am about to send
troops to Ithaca, for the establishment of Ulysses, or at least
of Telemachus, while Telemachus himself is engaged in war
against the Daunians?"</p>

<p>"Be in no pain about that," replied Mentor; "I will say
nothing that is false. The vessels that you are fitting out to
establish your commerce, will sail to the coast of Epirus, and
will effect two purposes at once: they will bring back the foreign
merchants whom high duties have driven from Salentum,
and they will seek intelligence of Ulysses. If he is still living,
he cannot be far from the seas that divide Greece from Italy,
and it has been confidently reported that he has been seen
among the Pheacians. But if Ulysses should not be found,
your vessels will render an important service to his son; they
will spread terror, with the name of Telemachus, through all
Ithaca and the neighboring country, where it is now believed
that he is dead as well as his father. The suitors of Penelope
will be struck with astonishment to learn that he is returning
with the forces of a powerful ally. The Ithacans will be awed
into obedience. Penelope will be encouraged to persist in her
refusal of a second husband. Thus will you render service to
Telemachus, while he is rendering service to you by taking
your place in the confederacy against the Daunians."</p>

<p>"Happy is the king," said Idomeneus, "that is favored with
such counsel; but doubly happy is he who feels its importance,
and improves it to his advantage! A wise and faithful friend
is better than a victorious army; yet kings too often withdraw
their confidence from the faithful and the wise, of whose virtue
they stand in awe, and resign themselves to flatterers, of whose
perfidy they have no dread. I fell myself into that fatal error,
and I will relate to you the misfortunes that I drew upon myself
by a connection with a false friend, who flattered my
passions in hopes that, in my turn, I should gratify his."</p>

<p>Mentor found it easy to convince the allies that Idomeneus

<!-- page 344 -->

ought to take charge of the affairs of Telemachus, while Telemachus
was, on his behalf, engaged in his confederacy. They
were well satisfied to have among them the son of the great
Ulysses, with a hundred Cretan youths whom Idomeneus had
put under his command. These young men were the flower
of the nobility, whom Idomeneus had brought from their
native country, and whom Mentor had advised him to send in
this expedition. "It is necessary," said he, "to increase the
number of your people during peace; but, to prevent a national
insensibility to military honor, and ignorance of military art, it
is proper to send the young nobility into foreign service. This,
by connecting the idea of a soldier's character with that of
noble descent and elevated rank, will be sufficient to kindle
and keep alive a national sense of glory, a love of arms, a
patience of fatigue, a contempt of death, and even an experimental
knowledge of the art of war."</p>

<p>The confederate princes departed from Salentum, well content
with Idomeneus, and charmed with the wisdom of Mentor.
They were also highly pleased to be accompanied by Telemachus.
But Telemachus was overwhelmed with grief when he
came to part with his friend. While the kings were taking
their leave of Idomeneus, and vowing to preserve their alliance
inviolable forever, Mentor held Telemachus to his breast in a
transport of silent tenderness, and found himself bedewed with
his tears. "I have no joy," said Telemachus, "in the search
of glory; I feel no passion but grief at our separation. It
seems to me that I see the return of the unhappy hour when
the Egyptians forced me from your arms to a distant country,
leaving me no hope of seeing you again."</p>

<p>Mentor soothed him with words of gentleness and comfort.
"This separation," said he, "is very different from that in
Egypt; it is voluntary, it will be short, and it will be rewarded
with glory. You must love me, my son, with less tenderness
and more fortitude: you must accustom yourself to my absence,
for the time is coming when we must part forever: you should
learn what is right, rather from the inspiration of wisdom and
of virtue, than from the presence of Mentor."</p>

<!-- page 345 -->

<p>The goddess, who was concealed under the figure of Mentor,
then covered Telemachus with her &aelig;gis, and diffused within
him the spirit of wisdom and foresight, of intrepid courage and
gentle moderation,&mdash;virtues which so rarely meet.</p>

<p>"Go," said she, "wherever you are called by duty, without
considering whether it be dangerous or safe. A prince may
avoid danger, with less disgrace, by declining a war, than by
keeping aloof in battle. The courage of him who commands
others, should never be doubtful. If it is desirable that a
nation should preserve its prince, it is still more desirable that
the prince should preserve his honor. Remember that the
commander of others should also be their example, and excite
the courage of his army by a display of his own. Fear no
danger, then, O Telemachus, but rather perish in the combat
than bring your valor into question. The sycophants who
would appear most forward in persuading you not to expose
yourself to danger, when danger is necessary, would be the
first to whisper that you wanted courage if you should take
their advice.</p>

<p>"Do not, however, incur danger unnecessarily. Courage is
a virtue only in proportion as it is directed by prudence.
Without prudence, it is a senseless contempt of life, a mere
brutal ardor. Precipitate courage secures no advantage. He
who, in danger, does not retain his self-possession, is rather
furious than brave: he is superior to fear only as he is incapable
of thought: in proportion as he is free from perturbation,
he is timid; and if he does not fly, he is in confusion: his
mind is not at liberty to dispense proper orders, nor to seize
and improve the transient but important opportunities, which
arise in battle, of distressing the enemy and doing service to
his country. If he has the ardor of a soldier, he has not the
discernment of a commander. Neither has he that courage
which is requisite in the private; for the private ought to preserve,
in the heat of action, such presence of mind as is necessary
to understand and obey the orders of his officer. He
that exposes himself rashly interrupts the order and discipline
if the troops, gives an example of pernicious temerity, and

<!-- page 346 -->

frequently exposes the whole army to irretrievable disadvantages.
Those who prefer the gratification of their own idle
ambition to the security of a common cause, deserve rather
punishment than reward.</p>

<p>"Be careful, my dear son, to avoid precipitation even in the
pursuit of glory; for glory is to be acquired only by waiting
in patient tranquillity for the moment of advantage. Virtue is
more revered in proportion as she appears to be quiet, placid,
and unassuming. As the necessity of exposing yourself to
danger increases, so should your expedients, your foresight,
and your courage. Remember, also, to avoid whatever may
draw upon you the envy of your associates, and never let the
success of another excite envy in you. Give praise liberally
for whatever shall merit praise, but never praise indiscriminately:
display the good with pleasure, hide the bad, and let it
not be remembered but with compassion.</p>

<p>"Never decide in the presence of old commanders, who have
all the experience that you want: hear their opinions with
deference, consult them, solicit the assistance of the most
skilful, and never be ashamed to attribute your best actions to
their counsel. Lastly, never listen to any discourse which
tends to make you jealous or mistrustful of other chiefs.
Speak your mind to them with confidence and ingenuity. If
you think their behavior to you has been exceptionable, open
your heart at once, and tell them why you think so. If they
are capable of feeling the noble generosity of this conduct,
they will be delighted with it, and you will find no difficulty in
obtaining from them all the concessions that you can reasonably
expect. If their insensibility is so gross that the rectitude
of this behavior is lost upon them, you will, at least, have
gained an experimental knowledge of what may be expected
from them; you will order matters so that you may have no
more contest with them during the war, and you will have
nothing to reproach yourself with on their account. But
above all, be careful never to drop the least hint of your displeasure
before the sycophants who are ever busy to sow jealousy
and division.</p>

<!-- page 347 -->

"I will remain here," continued Mentor, "to assist Idomeneus
in taking those measures which are indispensably necessary
for the good of his people, and for completing the correction
of those faults which evil counsellors and flatterers have
seduced him to commit, in the establishment of his new kingdom."</p>

<p>Telemachus could not help expressing some surprise, and
even some contempt, at the conduct of Idomeneus. But
Mentor checked him in a tone of severity. "Do you wonder,"
said he, "that the most estimable of men are men still, and,
among the innumerable snares and perplexities which are
inseparable from royalty, show some traces of human infirmity?
In Idomeneus, the ideas of pomp and magnificence have been
planted and nurtured from his youth, and where is the philosopher,
who, in his place, would always have been superior to
flattery? He has, indeed, suffered himself to be too much
influenced by those in whom he confided, but the wisest kings,
whatever is their precaution, are often deceived. A king cannot
do every thing himself; he must therefore have ministers,
and in these ministers he must confide. Besides, a king cannot
know those that surround him so well as they are known
by others; for in his presence they never appear without a
mask, and every artifice that cunning can devise is practised
to deceive him. Alas, my dear Telemachus, your own experience
will confirm this truth but too well. We never find either
the virtues or abilities in mankind that we seek. With whatever
diligence and penetration we study their characters, we are
every day mistaken in our conclusions. We can never avail
ourselves, for the public good, of all the virtues and abilities
that we find; for the best men have their prejudices, their
aversions, and their jealousies; they will seldom give up any
opinion, however singular, or renounce any foible, however
pernicious.</p>

<p>"The greater the dominion, the more numerous must be the
ministry; for there will be more that the prince cannot do
himself, and, therefore, more that he must do by others; and
the greater the number of those to whom he must delegate his

<!-- page 348 -->

authority, the more liable he is to be somewhere mistaken in
his choice. He who is a severe censor of kings to-day, would
to-morrow govern much worse than those whom he condemns;
and, if he were intrusted with the same power, he would commit
the same faults, and many others much greater. A private
station, if a man has some degree of natural eloquence,
conceals defects, displays shining talents to advantage, and
makes him appear worthy of all the posts that he does not fill.
But authority brings a man's abilities to a severe test, and discovers
great faults which the shades of obscurity concealed.</p>

<p>"Greatness resembles those glasses<sup id="t_ref133"><a href="#t_en133">133</a></sup> which represent every
object larger than it is. Every defect seems to expand in an
elevated situation, where things, in themselves small, are, in
their consequences, great, and the slightest faults excite vehement
opposition. A prince is an individual whose conduct the
whole world is perpetually employed to watch, and disposed to
condemn. He is judged with the utmost rigor by those who
can only guess at his situation, who have not the least sense
of the difficulties that attend it, and who expect that, to answer
their ideas of perfection, he should be no longer a man. A
king, however, can be no more; his goodness and his wisdom
are bounded by his human nature. He has humors, passions,
and habits, which it is impossible he should always surmount.
He is continually beset by self-interest and cunning; he never
finds the assistance that he seeks. He is perpetually led into
mistakes, sometimes by his own passions, and sometimes by
those of his ministers. He can scarcely repair one fault before
he falls into another. Such is the situation even of those kings
who have most wisdom and most virtue.</p>

<p>"The longest and best reign is too short, and too defective,
to correct, at the end, what has undesignedly been done amiss
in the beginning. Such evils are inseparable from royalty,
and human weakness must sink under such a load. Kings
should be pitied and excused. Should not they be pitied who
are called to the government of an innumerable multitude,

<!-- page 349 -->

whose wants are infinite, and who cannot but keep every
faculty of those who would govern them well upon the
stretch? Or, to speak freely, are not men to be pitied for
their necessary subjection to a mortal like themselves? A
god only can fulfil the duties of dominion. The prince, however,
is not less to be pitied than the people,&mdash;a weak and
imperfect creature, the governor of a corrupt and deceitful
multitude!"</p>

<p>"But," said Telemachus, with vivacity, "Idomeneus has
already lost Crete, the kingdom of his ancestors, by his indiscretion;
and he would have lost Salentum, which he is founding
in its stead, if it had not been preserved by your wisdom."</p>

<p>"I confess," replied Mentor, "that Idomeneus has been
guilty of great faults; but, look through Greece, and every
other country upon earth, and see whether among those that
are most improved, you can find one prince that is not, in
many instances, inexcusable. The greatest men have, in their
natural disposition, and in the constitutional character of their
minds, defects which naturally mislead them; and the best
men are those who have the courage to acknowledge these
defects and repair the mischiefs that they produce. Do you
imagine that Ulysses, the great Ulysses your father, who is
considered as an example by all the sovereigns of Greece, is
without weakness and imperfection? If he had not been
favored with the perpetual guidance and protection of Minerva,
how often would he have sunk under the dangers to
which the wanton malignity of fortune has exposed him!
How often has the goddess restrained and corrected him, that
he might walk on in the path of virtue till he arrived at glory!
And when you shall see him reigning in all the splendor of
his excellence in Ithaca, do not expect to find him perfect.
He has been the admiration of Greece, of Asia, and of all the
islands of the sea, notwithstanding his failings, which, among
the shining wonders of his character, are forgotten. If you,
also, can thus admire him, and, by a happy emulation of his
wisdom and virtue, transplant them into your own bosom, you
will need no other happiness or honor.</p>

<!-- page 350 -->

<p>"Accustom yourself not to expect, from the greatest men,
more than human nature can effect. It is common for the
inexperience and presumption of youth to indulge a severity
of judgment, which leads it to condemn the characters that it
ought to imitate, and produces a hopeless indocility. You
ought not only to love, respect, and imitate your father, notwithstanding
his imperfections, but you ought also very highly
to esteem Idomeneus, notwithstanding such parts of his character
and conduct as I have shown to deserve censure. He is
naturally sincere, upright, equitable, kind, and magnificent;
his courage is perfect; he detests fraud the moment he perceives
it. All his external qualifications are great, and suitable
to his rank. His ingenuous disposition to acknowledge
his errors, his mild and patient endurance of my severe reprehension,
his fortitude against himself, to make public reparation
for his faults, and thus to place himself above the censure
of others, are indubitable testimonies that he has true greatness
of mind. There are some faults from which a man of little
merit may be preserved, by good fortune or by good counsel;
but it is only by an effort of the most exalted virtue that
a king, who has been so long seduced by flattery, can correct
his faults. It is more glorious thus to rise than never to have
fallen.</p>

<p>"The faults of Idomeneus are such as almost all kings have
committed, but his reparation is such as has been made by
none. As for myself, while I reproved I admired him; for he
permitted my reproof. Do you admire him also, my dear
Telemachus: it is less for his reputation than your advantage
that I give you this counsel."</p>

<p>By this discourse Mentor made Telemachus sensible, that
he who judges with severity of others endangers his own virtue,
especially if they are burdened by the perplexities and
difficulties of government. "But it is now," said he, "time to
part. Farewell! I will wait here, my dear Telemachus, for your
return. Remember, that those who fear the gods have nothing
to fear from men. You will be exposed to extreme danger,
but remember that you will never be forsaken by Minerva."</p>

<!-- page 351 -->

<p>At this moment Telemachus became conscious of the presence
of the goddess, and he would have known that it was
the very voice of Minerva that had inspired him with fortitude,
if she had not immediately recalled the image of Mentor to his
mind, by addressing him in the character she had assumed.
"Remember," said she, "my son, the care which I took, during
your infancy, to render you as wise and as brave as your
father. Do nothing that is unworthy of his example, or of my
precepts."</p>

<p>The sun had already risen, and was tinging the summit of
the mountains with gold, when the confederate kings departed
from Salentum to return to their troops. These troops, that
had been encamped round the city, began to march under
their leaders. Their pikes rose like a forest on every side,
their shields glittered in the sun, and a cloud of dust ascended
to the sky. The kings were conducted to the plain by Idomeneus
and Mentor, who attended them to a considerable distance
from the city. At last they parted, having given and
received reciprocal testimonies of sincere friendship. And the
allies, being now acquainted with the true character of Idomeneus,
which had suffered so much by misrepresentation, had
no doubt that the peace would be lasting; they had, indeed,
formed their judgment of him, not from his natural sentiments,
but from the pernicious counsel of flatterers which he had implicitly
taken.</p>

<p>When the army was gone, Idomeneus led Mentor into every
quarter of the city. "Let us see," said Mentor, "how many
people you have, as well in the city as in the country; let us
number the whole. Let us also examine how many of them
are husbandmen. Let us inquire how much corn, wine, oil,
and other necessaries, your lands will produce one year with
another; we shall then know whether it will yield a surplus
for foreign trade. Let us also see how many vessels you have,
and how many sailors to man them, that we may be able to
judge of your strength." He then visited the port, and went
on board every vessel. He informed himself of the several
ports to which they traded&mdash;what merchandise they carried

<!-- page 352 -->

out, and what they brought back in return&mdash;what was the
expense of the voyage&mdash;what were the loans of the merchants
to each other&mdash;and what trading societies were established
among them, that he might know whether their articles were
equitable and faithfully observed&mdash;finally, what was the risk
of the several voyages, and to what losses the trade was exposed,
that such restrictions might be made as would prevent
the ruin of the merchants, who sometimes, from too eager a
desire of gain, undertook what they were not in a condition to
accomplish.</p>

<p>He ordered that bankruptcy should be punished with great
severity, because it is generally the effect of rashness and indiscretion,
if not of fraud. He also formed regulations by
which bankruptcies might easily be prevented. He obliged
the merchants to give an account of their effects, their profits,
their expenses, and their undertakings, to magistrates established
for this purpose. He ordered that they should never be
permitted to risk the property of another, nor more than half
their own; that they should undertake, by association, what
they could not undertake singly, and that the observance of
the conditions of such association should be enforced by severe
penalties. He ordered also that trade should be perfectly open
and free; and, instead of loading it with imposts, that every
merchant who brought the trade of a new nation to the port of
Salentum should be entitled to a reward.</p>

<p>These regulations brought people in crowds from all parts.
The trade of Salentum was like the flux and reflux of the sea.
Riches flowed in upon it with an impetuous abundance, like
waves impelling waves. Every thing was freely brought in
and carried out of the port. Every thing that was brought
was useful, and every thing that was carried out left something
of greater advantage in its stead. Justice presided over the
port, which was the centre of innumerable nations, with inflexible
severity. From the lofty towers, that were at once its
ornament and defence, freedom, integrity, and honor seemed
to call together the merchants of the remotest regions of the
earth; and these merchants, whether they came from the

<!-- page 353 -->

shores of the east, where the sun rises from the parting wave
to begin the day, or from that boundless ocean where, wearied
with his course, he extinguishes his fires&mdash;all lived together in
Salentum, as in their native country, with security and peace.</p>

<p>Mentor then visited the magazines, warehouses, and manufactories
of the interior part of the city. He prohibited the
sale of all foreign commodities that might introduce luxury or
effeminacy. He regulated the dress and the provisions of the
inhabitants of every rank, and the furniture, the size, and
ornaments of their houses. He also prohibited all ornaments
of silver and gold. "I know but one thing," said he to Idomeneus,
"that can render your people modest in their expenses&mdash;the
example of their prince. It is necessary that there should
be a certain dignity in your appearance, but your authority
will be sufficiently marked by the guards, and the great officers
of your court, that will always attend you. As to your dress,
be contented with the finest cloth of a purple color; let the
dress of your principal officers be of cloth equally fine; and let
your own be distinguished only by the color, and a slight
embroidery of gold round the edge. Different colors will
serve to distinguish different conditions, without either gold,
or silver, or jewels; and let these conditions be regulated by
birth.</p>

<p>"Put the most ancient and illustrious nobility in the first
rank. Those who are distinguished by personal merit, and by
the authority of office, will be contented to stand second to
those who have been long in possession of hereditary honor.
Men who are not noble by descent, will readily yield precedence
to those that are, if you take care not to encourage a
false opinion of themselves by raising them too suddenly and
too high, and if you never fail to gratify those with praise
who are modest in prosperity. No distinction so little excites
envy as that which is derived from ancestors by a long
descent.</p>

<p>"To stimulate virtue, and excite an emulation to serve the
State, it will be sufficient to reward public merit with honorary
distinctions&mdash;crowns or statues, which may be made the foundation

<!-- page 354 -->

of a new nobility, for the children of those to whom
they are decreed.</p>

<p>"The habit of persons of the first rank may be white, bordered
with a fringe of gold. They may also be distinguished
by a gold ring on their finger, and a medal of gold impressed
with your image hanging from their neck. Those of the
second rank may be dressed in blue, with a silver fringe, and
be distinguished by the ring without the medal. The third
rank may be dressed in green, and wear the medal without
either fringe or ring. The color of the fourth class may be a
full yellow; of the fifth, a pale red; of the sixth, a mixture of
red and white; of the seventh, a mixture of white and yellow.</p>

<p>"Dresses of these different colors will sufficiently distinguish
the freemen of your State into seven classes. The habit of
slaves should be dark gray.<sup id="t_ref134"><a href="#t_en134">134</a></sup> Thus each will be distinguished
according to his condition, without expense, and every art
which can only gratify pride will be banished from Salentum.
All the artificers which are now employed so much to the disadvantage
of their country will betake themselves to such arts
as are useful, which are few, or to commerce or agriculture.
No change must ever be suffered to take place either in the
quality of the stuff or the form of the garment; men are, by
nature, formed for serious and important employments, and it
is unworthy of them to invent affected novelties in the clothes
that cover them, or suffer the women, whom such employment
would less disgrace, to fall into an extravagance contemptible
and pernicious."</p>

<p>Thus Mentor, like a skilful gardener who lops from his fruit-trees
the useless wood, endeavored to retrench the parade that
insensibly corrupts the manners, and to reduce every thing to
a frugal and noble simplicity. He regulated even the provisions,
not of the slaves only, but those of the highest rank.
"What a shame is it," said he, "that men of exalted stations
should place their superiority in eating such food as effeminates

<!-- page 355 -->

the mind, and subverts the constitution! They ought to value
themselves for the regulation of their own desires, for their
power of dispensing good to others, and for the reputation
which the exercise of private and public virtue will necessarily
procure. To the sober and temperate the simplest food is
always pleasant; and the simplest food only can produce the
most vigorous health, and give at once capacity and disposition
for the purest and the highest enjoyments. Your meal should
consist of the best food; but it should always be plainly
dressed. The art of cookery is the art of poisoning mankind,
by rendering the appetite still importunate, when the wants of
nature are supplied."</p>

<p>Idomeneus easily conceived that he had done wrong in suffering
the inhabitants of this new city to corrupt and effeminate
their manners by violating the sumptuary laws of Minos;
but Mentor further convinced him that the revival of those
laws would produce little effect, if the king did not give them
force by his example. He therefore immediately regulated
his own table, where he admitted only plain food, such as he
had eaten with other Grecian princes at the siege of Troy, with
the finest bread, and a small quantity of the wine of the country,
which was generous and well-flavored. No man dared to
murmur at a regulation which the king imposed upon himself,
and the profusion and false delicacy of the table were given up
without a struggle.</p>

<p>Mentor suppressed also two kinds of music,&mdash;the soft and
effeminate strains which dissolve the soul into languishment
and desire, and the Bacchanalian airs that transport it with
causeless, tumultuous, and opprobrious joy. He allowed only
that sacred and solemn harmony, which, in the temples of the
gods, kindles devotion, and celebrates heroic virtue. To the
temples also he confined the superb ornaments of architecture,
columns, pediments, and porticos: he gave models, in a simple
but elegant style of building, for houses, that would contain a
numerous family, on a moderate extent of ground, so designed
that they should be at once pleasant and convenient; that they
should have a healthful aspect, and apartments sufficiently

<!-- page 356 -->

separated from each other that order and decency might easily
be preserved, and that they might be maintained at a small
expense.</p>

<p>He ordered that every house above the middling class should
have a hall and a small peristyle, with separate chambers for
all the free persons of the family. But he prohibited, under
severe penalties, the superfluous number and magnificence of
apartments that ostentation and luxury had introduced. Houses
erected upon these models, according to the size of the family,
served to embellish one part of the city at a small expense, and
gave it a regular appearance; while the other part, which was
already finished according to the caprice and vanity of individuals,
was, notwithstanding its magnificence, less pleasing and
convenient. This city was built in a very short time, because
the neighboring coast of Greece furnished very skilful architects,
and a great number of masons repaired thither from Epirus,
and other countries, upon the promise, that after they had finished
their work, they should be established in the neighborhood
of Salentum, where land should be granted them to clear,
and where they would contribute to people the country.</p>

<p>Painting and sculpture were arts which Mentor thought
should by no means be proscribed; but he permitted the practice
of them to few. He established a school under masters of
exquisite taste, by whom the performances of the pupils were
examined. "There should be no mediocrity," he said, "in the
arts which are not necessary to life. Consequently, no youths
shall be permitted to practise them, but such as have a genius
to excel. Others were designed by nature for less noble occupations,
and may be very usefully employed in supplying the
ordinary wants of the community. Sculptors and painters
should be employed only to preserve the memory of great men
and great actions. The representations of whatever has been
achieved by heroic virtue, for the service of the public, should
be preserved only in public buildings, or on the monuments of
the dead."</p>

<p>But whatever was the moderation or the frugality of Mentor,
he indulged the taste of magnificence in the great buildings

<!-- page 357 -->

that were intended for public sports, the races of horses and
chariots, combats with the cestus, wrestling, and all other exercises
which render the body more agile and vigorous.</p>

He suppressed a great number of traders that sold wrought
stuffs of foreign manufacture&mdash;embroidery of an excessive
price&mdash;vases of silver and gold, embossed with various figures
in bass-relief&mdash;distilled liquors and perfumes. He ordered, also,
that the furniture of every house should be plain and substantial,
so as not soon to wear out. The people of Salentum,
therefore, who had been used to complain of being poor, began
to perceive that they abounded in superfluous riches, but that
this superfluity was of a deceitful kind; that they were poor in
proportion as they possessed it, and that only in proportion as
they relinquished it, could they be rich. "To become truly
rich," said they, "is to despise such riches as exhaust the State,
and to lessen the number of our wants by reducing them to
the necessities of nature."</p>

<p>Mentor also took the first opportunity to visit the arsenals
and magazines, and examine whether the arms and other
necessaries of war were in a good condition. "To be always
ready for war," said he, "is the surest way to avoid it." He
found many things wanting, and immediately employed artificers
in brass and iron to supply the defects. Furnaces were
immediately built, and smoke and flames ascended in cloudy
volumes, like those that issue from the subterranean fires of
Mount &AElig;tna. The hammer rang upon the anvil, which groaned
under the stroke; the neighboring shores and mountains re-echoed
to the sound; and a spectator of these preparations for
war, made by a provident sagacity during a profound peace,
might have thought himself in that island where Vulcan animates
the Cyclops, by his example, to forge thunder for the
father of the gods.</p>

<p>Mentor then went with Idomeneus out of the city, and found
a great extent of fertile country wholly uncultivated, besides
considerable tracts that were cultivated but in part, through the
negligence or poverty of the husbandmen, through the want of
spirit or the want of hands. "This country," said he to the

<!-- page 358 -->

king, "is ready to enrich its inhabitants, but the inhabitants
are not sufficient to cultivate the country. Let us, then, remove
the superfluous artificers from the city, whose professions serve
only to corrupt the manners of the people, and let us employ
them in fertilizing those plains and hills. It is a misfortune
that these men, having been employed in arts which require a
sedentary life, are unused to labor; but we will try to remedy
this evil; we will divide these uncultivated lands into lots
among them, and call in the neighboring people to their assistance,
who will gladly undertake the most laborious part of the
work, upon condition that they should receive a certain portion
of the produce of the lands they clear. They may afterwards
be made proprietors of part of it, and be thus incorporated with
your people, who are by no means sufficiently numerous. If
they prove diligent and obedient to the laws, they will be good
subjects and increase your power. The artisans, whom you
shall transplant from the city to the fields, will bring up their
children to the labors of rural life. Moreover, the foreigners,
whom you have employed to assist in building your city, have
engaged to clear part of your lands, and become husbandmen.
These men, as soon as they have finished the public buildings,
you should incorporate with your people. They will think
themselves happy to pass their lives under a government so
gentle as that which you have now established. As they are
robust and laborious, their example will animate the transplanted
artificers with whom they will be mixed, and in a short
time your country will abound with a vigorous race, wholly
devoted to agriculture.</p>

<p>"When this is done, be in no pain about the multiplication
of your people; they will, in a short time, become innumerable,
if you facilitate marriage. The most simple way of
facilitating marriage is the most effectual. All men are naturally
inclined to marry, and nothing prevents them from indulging
this inclination but the prospect of difficulty and
distress. If you do not load them with taxes, their families
will never become a burden; for the earth is never ungrateful,
but always affords sustenance to those who diligently cultivate

<!-- page 359 -->

it; it refuses its bounty only to those who refuse their labor.
Husbandmen are always rich in proportion to the number of
their children, if their prince does not make them poor; for
the children afford them some assistance, even from their infancy.
The youngest can drive the flock to pasture, those
that are further advanced can look after the cattle, and those
of the third stage can work with their father in the field. In
the mean time the girls assist the mother, who prepares a
simple but wholesome repast for those that are abroad, when
they return home fatigued with the labor of the day. She milks
her cows and her ewes; she brings out her little stores, her
cheeses, and her chestnuts, with fruits that she has preserved
from decay; she piles up the social fire, and the family gathers
round it; every countenance brightens with the smile of innocence
and peace, and some rural ditty diverts them till the
night calls them to rest.</p>

<p>"The shepherd returns with his pipe, and to the assembled
family sings some new song that he has learnt at the neighboring
village. Those that have been at work in the fields come
in with the plough and the weary oxen, that hang down their
heads, and move with a slow and heavy pace, notwithstanding
the goad, which now urges them in vain. All the sufferings
of labor end with the day; the poppies which, at the command
of the gods, are scattered over the earth by the hand
of sleep, charm away every care; sweet enchantment lulls all
nature into peace, and the weary rest, without anticipating
the troubles of to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Happy, indeed, are those unambitious, mistrustless, artless
people, if the gods vouchsafe them a king that disturbs
not their blameless joy! And of what horrid inhumanity are
they guilty, who, to gratify pride and ambition, wrest from
them the sweet products of the field, which they owe to the
liberality of nature and the sweat of their brow! In the
fruitful lap of nature there is inexhaustible plenty for temperance
and labor: if none were luxurious and idle, none would
be wretched and poor."</p>

<p>"But what shall I do," said Idomeneus, "if the people

<!-- page 360 -->

that I scatter over this fertile country should neglect to cultivate
it?"</p>

<p>"You must do," said Mentor, "just contrary to what is commonly
done. Rapacious and inconsiderate princes think only
of taxing those who are most industrious to improve their
land; because, upon these, they suppose a tax will be more
easily levied; and they spare those whom idleness has made
indigent. Reverse this mistaken and injurious conduct, which
oppresses virtue, rewards vice, and encourages a supineness
that is equally fatal to the king and to the State. Let your
taxes be heavy upon those who neglect the cultivation of their
lands, and add to your taxes fines, and other penalties if it is
necessary. Punish the negligent and the idle, as you would
the soldier who should desert his post. On the contrary,
grant to those who, in proportion as their families multiply,
cultivate their lands with the greater diligence, special privileges
and immunities. Every family will then become numerous,
and every one will be animated to labor, not only by the
desire of gain, but of honor. The state of husbandry being no
longer wretched, will no longer be contemptible. The plough,
once more held in honor, will be guided by the victorious
hands that have defended the country. It will not be less
glorious to cultivate a paternal inheritance in the security of
peace, than to draw the sword in its defence when it is endangered
by war. The whole country will bloom around you;
the golden ears of ripe corn will again crown the temples of
Ceres; Bacchus will tread the grapes in rich clusters under
his feet, and wine, more delicious than nectar, will flow from
the hills like a river; the valleys will resound to the song of
the shepherds, who, dispersed along the banks of a transparent
stream, shall join their voices with the pipe; while their
flocks shall frolic round them, and feast upon the flowery pasture
without fear of the wolf.</p>

<p>"O Idomeneus, will it not make you supremely happy to be
the source of such prosperity&mdash;to stretch your protection,
like the shadow of a rock, over so many people, who will repose
under it in security and peace?  Will you not, in the

<!-- page 361 -->

consciousness of this, enjoy a noble elevation of mind, a calm
sense of superior glory, such as can never touch the bosom of
the tyrant who lives only to desolate the earth, and who diffuses,
not less through his own dominions than those which
he conquers from others, carnage and tumult, horror and anguish,
consternation, famine, and despair? Happy, indeed, is
the prince, whom his own greatness of soul and the distinguishing
favor of the gods shall render thus the delight of his
people, and the example of succeeding ages! The world, instead
of taking up arms to oppose his power, will be found
prostrate at his feet, and suing to be subject to his dominion."</p>

<p>"But," said Idomeneus, "when the people shall be thus
blessed with plenty and peace, will not their happiness corrupt
their manners? will they not turn against me the very strength
I have given them?"</p>

<p>"There is no reason to fear that," said Mentor; "the sycophants
of prodigal princes have suggested it as a pretence for
oppression; but it may easily be prevented. The laws which
we have established with respect to agriculture will render life
laborious; and the people, notwithstanding their plenty, will
abound only in what is necessary, for we have prohibited the
arts that furnish superfluities; and the plenty even of necessaries
will be restrained within due bounds, by the facility of
marriage and the multiplication of families. In proportion as
a family becomes numerous, their portion of land being still
the same in extent, a more diligent cultivation will become
necessary, and this will require incessant labor. It is luxury
and idleness that render people insolent and rebellious. They
will have bread, indeed, and they will have bread enough; but
they will have nothing more, except what they can gain, from
their own ground, by the sweat of their brow.</p>

"That your people may continue in this state of mediocrity,
it will be necessary that you should now limit the extent of
ground that each family is to possess. We have, you know,
divided your people into seven classes, according to their different
conditions; and each family, in each class, must be permitted
to possess only such an extent of ground as is absolutely

<!-- page 362 -->

necessary for its subsistence. This regulation being inviolably
observed, the nobles can never get possession of the lands of
the poor. Every one will have land, but so much only as
will make a diligent cultivation necessary. If, in a long course
of years, the people should be so much increased that land
cannot be found for them at home, they may be sent to form
colonies abroad, which will be a new advantage to the mother
country.</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that care should be taken even to prevent
wine from being too common in your kingdom. If you find
that too many vines are planted, you should cause them to be
grubbed up. Some of the most dreadful mischiefs that afflict
mankind proceed from wine; it is the cause of disease, quarrels,
sedition, idleness, aversion to labor, and every species of
domestic disorder. Let wine then be considered as a kind of
medicine; or as a scarce liquor, to be used only at the sacrifices
of the gods, or in seasons of public festivity. Do not,
however, flatter yourself that this regulation can ever take
place without the sanction of your own example.</p>

<p>"The laws of Minos, with respect to the education of children,
must also be inviolably preserved. Public schools must
be established, to teach them the fear of the gods, the love of
their country, a reverence for the laws, and a preference of
honor not only to pleasure but to life.</p>

<p>"Magistrates must be appointed to superintend the conduct
not only of every family, but of every person. You must keep
also your own eye upon them; for you are a king, only to be
the shepherd of your people, and to watch over your flock
night and day. By this unremitted vigilance you will prevent
many disorders and many crimes. Such crimes as you
cannot prevent, you must immediately punish with severity;
for, in this case, severity to the individual is clemency to the
public&mdash;it stops those irregularities at their source which
would deluge the country with misery and guilt. The taking
away of one life, upon a proper occasion, will be the preservation
of many, and will make a prince sufficiently feared, without
general or frequent severity.</p>

<!-- page 363 -->

<p>"It is a detestable maxim, that the security of the prince
depends only upon the oppression of the people. Should no
care be taken to improve their knowledge or their morals?
Instead of being taught to love him whom they are born to
obey, should they be driven by terror to despair, and reduced
to the dreadful necessity of either throwing off the yoke of
their tyrant, or perishing under its weight? Can this be the
way to reign with tranquillity? can this be the path that leads
to glory?</p>

<p>"Remember, that the sovereign who is most absolute is
always least powerful: he seizes upon all, and his grasp is
ruin. He is, indeed, the sole proprietor of whatever his State
contains; but, for that reason, his State contains nothing of
value: the fields are uncultivated, and almost a desert; the
towns lose some of their few inhabitants every day; and trade
every day declines. The king, who must cease to be a king
when he ceases to have subjects, and who is great only in
virtue of his people, is himself insensibly losing his character
and his power, as the number of his people, from whom alone
both are derived, insensibly diminishes. His dominions are
at length exhausted of money and of men: the loss of men is
the greatest and the most irreparable he can sustain. Absolute
power degrades every subject to a slave. The tyrant is
flattered, even to an appearance of adoration, and every one
trembles at the glance of his eye; but, at the least revolt, this
enormous power perishes by its own excess. It derived no
strength from the love of the people; it wearied and provoked
all that it could reach; and rendered every individual of the
State impatient of its continuance. At the first stroke of opposition,
the idol is overturned, broken to pieces, and trodden
under foot. Contempt, hatred, fear, resentment, distrust, and
every other passion of the soul, unite against so hateful a despotism.
The king who, in his vain prosperity, found no man
bold enough to tell him the truth, in his adversity finds no
man kind enough to excuse his faults, or to defend him against
his enemies."</p>

<p>Idomeneus then hastened to distribute his uncultivated lands,

<!-- page 364 -->

to people them with useful artificers, and to carry all the counsels
of Mentor into execution,&mdash;reserving for the builders such
parts as had been allotted them, which they were not to cultivate
till they had finished the city.</p>

Just and mild was the government of Idomeneus, and it
soon drew the inhabitants of the neighboring countries in
crowds to Salentum, to be incorporated with his people and
share the felicity of his reign. The fields, which had been long
overgrown with thorns and brambles, now promised a rich
harvest and fruits that were unknown before. The earth opens
her bosom to the ploughshare, and gets ready her treasures to
reward the husbandman. Every eye sparkles with hope.
Innumerable flocks whiten alike the valleys and the hills; the
mountains resound with the lowing of the cattle, which, in
large herds, share the pasture with the sheep; and the pasture,
thus enriched, becomes more fertile in proportion to the number
that it feeds. These flocks and herds were procured by
the contrivance of Mentor, who advised Idomeneus to exchange
for them, with the Peucetes, a neighboring people, such superfluities
as were prohibited by the new regulations at Salentum.</p>

<p>At the same time, the city and the adjacent villages were
filled with the youth of both sexes, who had long languished
in dejection and indigence, and did not dare to marry for fear
of increasing their distress. When they perceived that Idomeneus
had adopted sentiments of humanity, and had become
the father of his people, they feared no longer the want of
food, nor any other scourge with which heaven chastises the
earth. Nothing was heard but shouts of joy and the songs of
shepherds and husbandmen, at the celebration of their marriage.
Pan seemed himself to be among them, and fauns and
satyrs to mix with nymphs in the dance, which the rural pipe
prompted in the forest-shade. Tranquillity was everywhere
heightened into joy, but the joy was nowhere perverted into
riot; it served only as a relaxation from labor, and that labor
rendered it at once more lively and more pure.</p>

<p>The old men were astonished to see what they had never
dared to hope through the whole course of a long life, and

<!-- page 365 -->

burst into tears with excess of tenderness and joy. Their
pleasure soon kindled into devotion, and, raising their tremulous
hands to heaven, they cried out: "O mighty Jupiter!
bless the prince that resembles thee, and is himself the greatest
blessing thou couldst bestow upon us. He is born for the
benefit of mankind; return to him the benefits that we receive
from him. The children of these marriages, and their descendants
to the last generation, will be indebted to him for their
existence, and he will be truly the father of his people." The
young couples that were married expressed their joy by singing
the praises of him from whom it was derived. His name was
continually on their lips, and his image in their hearts. They
thought themselves happy if they could see him, and they
feared his death as the greatest evil that could befall them.</p>

<p>And now Idomeneus confessed to Mentor that he had never
felt any pleasure equal to that of diffusing happiness and exciting
affection. "It is a pleasure," said he, "of which I had no
idea. I thought the greatness of a prince consisted in his
being the object of fear, and that the rest of mankind were
made only for him. What I had heard of kings that were the
love and the delight of their people, I despised as a fable; but
I now revere it as truth. I will, however, tell you by what
means these false notions, the cause of all my misfortunes, were
early planted in my heart."</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb11">BOOK XI.</h2>

<p class="small">Idomeneus relates to Mentor his confidence in Protesilaus, and the artifices
of that favorite, in concert with Timocrates, to betray him and destroy
Philocles. He confesses, that being prejudiced against him by these
confederates, he sent Timocrates to kill him while he was abroad with
the command of a fleet upon a dangerous expedition. Timocrates having
failed in his attempt, Philocles forbore to avenge himself by taking
his life, but, resigning the command of the fleet to Polymenes, who had
been appointed to succeed him in the written orders for his death, he
retired to the isle of Samos. Idomeneus adds that he at length discovered
the perfidy of Protesilaus, but that, even then, he could not shake
off his influence. Mentor prevails upon Idomeneus to banish Protesilaus
and Timocrates to the island of Samos, and recall Philocles to his
confidence and councils. Hegesippus, who is charged with this order,
executes it with joy. He arrives with his prisoners at Samos, where he
finds his friend Philocles in great indigence and obscurity, but content.
He at first refuses to return, but the gods having signified it to be their
pleasure, he embarks with Hegesippus, and arrives at Salentum, where
Idomeneus, who now sustains a new character, receives him with great
friendship.</p>

<p>"AMONG other persons whom I loved when I was very
young, were Protesilaus and Philocles. Protesilaus was somewhat
older than myself, and was my chief favorite. His natural
disposition, which was sprightly and enterprising, exactly
corresponded with my own. He entered into all my pleasures,
flattered all my passions, and endeavored to render me suspicious
of Philocles. Philocles had great reverence for the gods,
an elevated mind, and obedient passions; he placed greatness,
not in the acquisition of power, but in the conquest of self and
in never stooping to a mean action. He often warned me of
my faults with great freedom, and when he did not dare to
speak, his silence and the sorrow that was expressed in his
countenance sufficiently convinced me that I had given cause
for reproach.</p>

<!-- page 367 -->

<p>"This sincerity at first gave me pleasure, and I frequently
protested that I would always listen to the truths he told me,
as the best preservative against flattery. He directed me how
to walk in the steps of Minos, and give happiness to my people.
His wisdom was not indeed equal to thine, but I now know that
his counsel was good. By degrees, however, the artifices of
Protesilaus, who was jealous and aspiring, succeeded. The
frankness and integrity of Philocles disgusted me. He saw
his own loss of influence, under the ascendency of Protesilaus,
without a struggle: he contented himself with always telling
me the truth, whenever I would hear it; for he had my advantage,
and not his own interest, in view.</p>

<p>"Protesilaus insensibly persuaded me that he was of a morose
and haughty temper; that he was a severe censor of my conduct;
that he asked me no favor, only because he disdained
obligation, and aspired to the character of a man superior to
any honors. He added, that this youth, who spoke so freely
of my faults to myself, spoke of them also with the same freedom
to others; that he insinuated I was little worthy of
esteem; and that, by thus rendering me cheap in the eyes of
the people, and by the artful parade of an austere virtue, he
intended to open a way to the throne.</p>

<p>"At first I could not believe that Philocles intended to
deprive me of my crown; there is, in true virtue, something
open and ingenuous, which no art can counterfeit, and which,
if it is attended to, can never be mistaken. But the steadiness
with which Philocles opposed my follies began to weary me.
The flattering compliance of Protesilaus, and his indefatigable
industry to procure me new pleasures, made me still more impatient
of his rival's austerity.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, Protesilaus, perceiving that I did not
believe all he had told me of Philocles&mdash;his pride disdaining
the suspicion which his falsehood had deserved&mdash;resolved to
say nothing more to me about him, but to remove my doubts
by stronger evidence than that of words. He therefore advised
me to give Philocles the command of some vessels that
were fitted out against a fleet of the Carpathians, and supported

<!-- page 368 -->

his advice with great subtlety. 'You know,' said he, 'that my
commendations of Philocles cannot be suspected of partiality;
he is certainly brave, and has a genius for war; he is more fit
for this service than any other person you can send; and I
prefer the advancement of your interest to the gratification of
my own resentment.'</p>

<p>"This instance of generous integrity in a man to whom I
had intrusted the most important affairs delighted me. I embraced
him in a transport of joy, and thought myself superlatively
happy to have placed my confidence in a man who
appeared to be at once superior to passion and to interest.
But, alas! how much are princes to be pitied! This man
knew me better than I knew myself; he knew that kings are
generally mistrustful and indolent,&mdash;mistrustful by perpetually
experiencing the artifices of the designing and corrupt,&mdash;indolent
by the pleasures that solicit them, and the habit of leaving
all business to others, without taking the trouble so much as to
think for themselves. He knew, therefore, that it would not
be difficult to render me jealous of a man who could not fail
to perform great actions, especially when he was not present to
detect the fallacy.</p>

<p>"Philocles foresaw, at his departure, what would happen.
'Remember,' said he, 'that I can now no longer defend myself;
that you will be accessible only to my enemy; and that
while I am serving you at the risk of my life, I am likely to
obtain no other recompense than your indignation.' 'You are
mistaken,' said I: 'Protesilaus does not speak of you as you
speak of him; he commends, he esteems you, and thinks you
worthy of the most important trust;&mdash;if he should speak
against you he would forfeit my confidence. Go, therefore,
upon your expedition without fear, and think only how to conduct
it with advantage.' He departed, and left me in uncommon
perplexity.</p>

<p>"I confess that I saw very clearly the necessity of consulting
many understandings, and that nothing could more injure my
reputation or my interest, than an implicit resignation to the
counsels of an individual.  I knew that the prudent advice of

<!-- page 369 -->

Philocles had preserved me from many dangerous errors,
which the haughtiness of Protesilaus would have led me into.
I was conscious that in the mind of Philocles there was a fund
of probity and wisdom that I did not find in Protesilaus; but
I had suffered Protesilaus to assume a kind of dictatorial
manner, which at length I found myself scarcely able to resist.
I grew weary of consulting two men who could never agree,
and chose rather to hazard something in the administration
of my affairs, than continue the trouble of examining opposite
opinions, and judging for myself which was the best.
It is true I did not dare to assign the motives of so shameful
a choice, even to myself; but these motives still continued
their secret influence in my heart, and directed all my
actions.</p>

<p>"Philocles surprised the enemy, and, having gained a complete
victory, was hastening home to prevent the ill offices he
had reason to fear; but Protesilaus, who had not had time to
effect his purpose, wrote him word that it was my pleasure he
should improve his victory by making a descent upon the island
of Carpathus. He had, indeed, persuaded me that a conquest
of that island might easily be made, but he took care that
many things necessary to the enterprise should be wanting, and
gave Philocles also such orders as could not fail to embarrass
him in the execution of it.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, he engaged one of my domestics, a man
of very corrupt manners, who was much about me, to observe
all that passed, even to the minutest incident, and give him an
account of it, though they appeared seldom to see each other
and never to agree.</p>

<p>"This domestic, whose name was Timocrates, came to me
one day and told me as a great secret that he had discovered
a very dangerous affair.  'Philocles,' said he, 'intends, by the
assistance of your forces, to make himself king of Carpathus.
The officers are all in his interest, and he has gained the
private men partly by his liberality, but principally by the
pernicious irregularities which he tolerates among them.  He
is greatly elated by his victory; and here is a letter which he

<!-- page 370 -->

has written to one of his friends concerning his project, which,
after such evidence, it is impossible to doubt.'</p>

<p>"I read the letter, which appeared to me to be in the handwriting
of Philocles; but it was a forgery&mdash;concerted and
executed between Protesilaus and Timocrates. This letter
threw me into great astonishment: I read it again and again,
and when I called to mind how many affecting proofs Philocles
had given me of his disinterested fidelity, I could not persuade
myself that he was the writer. Yet, seeing the characters
to be his, what could I determine?</p>

<p>"When Timocrates perceived that his artifice had thus far
succeeded, he pushed it further. 'May I presume,' said he,
hesitating, 'to make one remark upon this letter? Philocles
tells his friend that he may speak in confidence to Protesilaus
of one thing; but he expresses that one thing by a cipher.
Protesilaus is certainly a party in the project of Philocles, and
they have accommodated their differences at your expense.
You know it was Protesilaus that pressed you to send Philocles
upon this expedition. For some time he has desisted from
speaking against him as he formerly did; he now takes every
opportunity to excuse and commend him, and they have frequently
met upon very good terms. There is no doubt that
Protesilaus has concerted measures with Philocles to share his
conquest between them. You see that he urged you to this
enterprise against all rules of prudence and of policy, and that,
to gratify his ambition, he has endangered the loss of your
fleet. Is it possible that he would have rendered himself thus
subservient to the ambition of Philocles, if there had been enmity
between them? It is manifest that they are associated
in a design to aggrandize themselves, and perhaps to supplant
you in the throne. I know that by thus revealing my suspicions
I expose myself to their resentment, if you shall still
leave your authority in their hands; however, since I have
done my duty I am careless of the event.'</p>

<p>"The last words of Timocrates sunk deep into my mind; I
doubted not that Philocles was a traitor, and I suspected Protesilaus
as his friend.  In the mean time, Timocrates was continually

<!-- page 371 -->

telling me that if I waited till Philocles had made a
conquest of Carpathus, it would be too late to frustrate his
designs. 'You must,' said he, 'secure him while he is in
your power.' But I was struck with such horror at the deep
dissimulation of mankind that I knew not whom to trust.
After having discovered Philocles to be a traitor, I knew no
man whose virtue could preclude suspicion. I resolved to cut
off Philocles immediately, but I feared Protesilaus; and with
respect to him, I was in doubt what to do. I feared equally
to find him guilty, and to trust him as innocent.</p>

<p>"Such was the perplexity of my mind, that I could not forbear
telling him I had some suspicions of Philocles. He
heard me with an appearance of the greatest surprise. He
reminded me of his integrity and moderation in many instances.
He exaggerated his services, and did every thing that
he could to strengthen my suspicions of there being too good
an understanding between them. Timocrates, at the same
time, was equally diligent on his part to fix my attention upon
every circumstance that favored the notion of a confederacy,
and was continually urging me to destroy Philocles while it
was in my power. How unhappy a state, my dear Mentor, is
royalty, and how much are kings the sport of other men, while
other men appear to be trembling at their feet!</p>

<p>"I thought it would be a stroke of profound policy, and
totally disconcert Protesilaus, to cut off Philocles immediately
by sending Timocrates secretly to the fleet for that purpose.
Protesilaus, in the mean time, carried on his dissimulation
with the steadiest perseverance and most refined subtlety: he
deceived me by appearing to be himself deceived. I sent
away Timocrates, who found Philocles greatly embarrassed in
making his descent, for which he was wholly unprovided.
Protesilaus, foreseeing that his forged letter might fail of its
effects, had taken care to have another resource, by making an
enterprise difficult which he had persuaded me would be easy,
and the miscarriage of which, therefore, could not fail of exposing
Philocles, who had conducted it, to my resentment.
Philocles, however, sustained himself under all difficulties

<!-- page 372 -->

by his courage, his genius, and his popularity among the
troops. There was not a private soldier in the army who did
not see that the project of a descent was rash and impracticable;
yet every one applied himself to the execution of it with
as much activity and zeal as if his life and fortune depended
upon its success. Every one was at all times ready to hazard
his life under a commander who was universally reverenced
for his wisdom and loved for his benevolence.</p>

<p>"Timocrates had every thing to fear from an attempt upon
the life of a general in the midst of an army by which he was
adored; but the fury of ambition is always blind. He saw
neither difficulty nor danger in any measure that could gratify
Protesilaus, in concert with whom he hoped to govern me
without control, as soon as Philocles should be dead. Protesilaus
could not bear the presence of a man whose very looks
were a silent reproach, and who could at once disappoint all
his projects by disclosing them to me.</p>

<p>"Timocrates, having corrupted two of Philocles' officers,
who were continually about his person, by promising them a
great reward in my name, sent him word that he had some
private instructions to communicate to him from me, and that
those two officers only must be present. Philocles immediately
admitted them to a private room, and shut the door.
As soon as they were alone, Timocrates made a stroke at him
with a poniard, which entering obliquely, made but a slight
wound. Philocles, with the calm fortitude of a man familiar
with danger, forced the weapon out of his hand, and defended
himself with it against the assassins, at the same time calling
for assistance. Some of the people that waited without immediately
forced the door, and disengaged him from his assailants,
who, being in great confusion, had made a feeble and
irresolute attack. They were immediately secured, and such
was the indignation of the soldiers that they would the next
moment have been torn to pieces, if Philocles had not interposed.
After the first tumult had subsided, he took Timocrates
aside, and asked him, without any tokens of resentment
what had prompted him to so horrid an attempt? Timocrates

<!-- page 373 -->

who was afraid of being instantly put to death, made haste to
produce the written order which I had given him for what he
had done; and as every villain is a coward, he thought only
of saving his life by disclosing the whole treachery of Protesilaus.</p>

<p>"Philocles, terrified at the spectacle of human malice, pursued
a course distinguished for moderation. He declared to
the troops that Timocrates was innocent; he took care to
secure him from their resentment, and sent him back in safety
to Crete. He then gave up the command of the army to
Polymenes, whom I had appointed, by written order, to succeed
him; and having exhorted the troops to continue steadfast
in the fidelity they owed me, he went on board a small
bark in the night, which landed him upon the island of Samos,
where he still lives, with great tranquillity, in poverty and solitude.
He procures a scanty subsistence by working as a
statuary, and wishes not so much as to hear of men who are
perfidious and unjust,&mdash;much less of kings, whom he believes
to be the most deceived and the most unhappy of men."</p>

<p>Idomeneus was here interrupted by Mentor. "Was it long,"
said he, "before you discovered the truth?" "No," responded
Idomeneus; "but I discovered it by degrees. It was, indeed,
not long before Protesilaus and Timocrates quarrelled; for it
is with great difficulty that the wicked can agree. Their dissension
fully disclosed the depth of the abyss into which they
had thrown me." "Well," said Mentor, "and did you not
immediately dismiss them both?" "Alas!" answered Idomeneus,
"can you be so ignorant of my weakness and the perplexity
of my situation? When a prince has once delivered
up himself with implicit confidence to bold and designing men,
who have the art of rendering themselves necessary, he must
never more hope to be free. Those whom he most despises,
he most distinguishes by his favor, and loads with benefits. I
abhorred Protesilaus, and yet left him in the possession of all
my authority. Strange infatuation! I was pleased to think
that I knew him, yet I had not resolution enough to avail
myself of that knowledge, and resume the power of which he

<!-- page 374 -->

was unworthy. I found him, indeed, pliant and attentive;
very diligent to flatter my passions, and very zealous to advance
my interests. I had, besides, some reasons which enabled
me to excuse my weakness to myself: having, unhappily,
never chosen persons of integrity to manage my affairs,
I doubted whether there was any such thing as integrity in
the world. I considered virtue rather as a phantom than a
reality; and thought it ridiculous to get out of the hands of
one bad man with great struggle and commotion, merely to
fall into the hands of another, who would neither be less interested
nor more sincere.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, the fleet commanded by Polymenes returned
to Crete. I thought no more of the conquest of Carpathus;
and Protesilaus' dissimulation was not so deep but
that I could perceive he was greatly mortified to hear that
Philocles was out of danger at Samos."</p>

<p>"But," said Mentor, "though you still continued Protesilaus
in his post, did you still trust your affairs implicitly to his management?"</p>

<p>"I was," responded Idomeneus, "too much an enemy to
business and application to take them out of his hands. The
trouble of instructing another would have broken in upon the
plan of life which my indolence had formed, and I had no
resolution to attempt it. I chose rather to shut my eyes than
to see the artifices that were practised against me. I contented
myself with letting a few of my favorites know that I was not
ignorant of his treachery. Thus knowing that I was cheated,
I imagined myself to be cheated but to a certain degree. I
sometimes made Protesilaus sensible that I was offended at his
usurpation. I frequently took pleasure in contradicting him,
in blaming him publicly for something he had done, and in
deciding contrary to his opinion; but he knew my supineness
and sloth too well to have any apprehensions on this account.
He always returned resolutely to the charge, sometimes with
argument and importunity, sometimes with softness and insinuation;
and, whenever he perceived that I was offended, he
doubled his assiduity in furnishing such amusements as were

<!-- page 375 -->

most likely to soothe and soften me, or to engage me in some
affair which he knew would make his assistance necessary, and
afford him an opportunity of showing his zeal for my reputation.</p>

<p>"This method of flattering my passions always succeeded,
notwithstanding I was upon my guard against it. He knew
all my secrets; he relieved me in every perplexity; he made
the people tremble at my name. I could not, therefore, resolve
to part with him. Yet, by keeping him in his place, I put it
out of the power of honest men to show me my true interest.
No man spoke freely in my council; truth withdrew from me,
and error, the harbinger of the fall of kings, perpetually punished
me for having sacrificed Philocles to the cruel ambition
of Protesilaus. Even those who were best affected to my
person and government thought themselves not obliged to
undeceive me after so dreadful an example. I myself, my dear
Mentor, was secretly afraid truth might burst through the
crowd of flattery that surrounded me, and reach me with irresistible
radiance; for I should have been troubled at the presence
of a guide which I could not but approve, yet wanted
resolution to follow. I should have regretted my vassalage,
without struggling to be free; for my own indolence, and the
ascendency that Protesilaus had gained over me, concurred to
chill me with the torpor of despair. I was conscious of a
shameful situation, which I wished alike to hide from others
and myself. You know the vain pride and false glory in
which kings are reared: they can never bear to acknowledge
themselves in the wrong. To conceal one fault, they will
commit a hundred. Rather than acknowledge they have been
once deceived, they will suffer themselves to be deceived forever.
Such is the condition of weak and indolent princes, and
such was mine when I set out for the siege of Troy.</p>

<p>"I left the sole administration of my government to Protesilaus,
and he behaved, during my absence, with great
haughtiness and inhumanity. The whole kingdom groaned
under his oppression, but no man dared to send information of
it to me: they knew that I dreaded the sight of truth, and
that I always gave up to the cruelty of Protesilaus those that

<!-- page 376 -->

ventured to speak against him. But the mischief increased in
proportion to the fear that concealed it. He afterwards obliged
me to dismiss Meriones, who followed me to the siege of Troy
and acquired immortal honor. He grew jealous of him after
my return, as he did of every man who was distinguished
either by my favor or his own virtue.</p>

<p>"The ascendency of Protesilaus, my dear Mentor, was the
source of all my misfortunes. The revolt of the Cretans was
not so much the effect of the death of my son, as of the vengeance
of the gods, whom my follies had provoked, and of the
hatred of the people which Protesilaus had drawn upon me.
An oppressive and tyrannical government had totally exhausted
the patience of my subjects, when I imbrued my hands in the
blood of my son; and the horror of that action only threw off
the veil from what had long lain concealed in their hearts.</p>

<p>"Timocrates went with me to the siege of Troy, and gave
private intelligence to Protesilaus by letter of all that he could
discover. I was conscious that I was in captivity, but instead
of making any effort to be free, I dismissed the subject from
my thoughts in despair. When the Cretans revolted at my
return, Protesilaus and Timocrates were the first that fled.
They would certainly have abandoned me if I had not been
obliged to fly almost at the same time. Be assured, my dear
Mentor, that those who are insolent in prosperity are passive
and timid in distress. The moment they are dispossessed of
their authority, all is consternation and despair with them. In
proportion as they have been haughty they become abject, and
they pass in a moment from one extreme to the other."</p>

<p>"But how comes it," said Mentor, "that, notwithstanding
you perfectly know the wickedness of these two men, I still see
them about you? I can account for their following you hither
because they had no prospect of greater advantage; and I can
easily conceive that you might afford them an asylum in this
rising city from a principle of generosity; but from what motive
can you still deliver yourself up to their management after
such dreadful experience of the mischiefs it must produce?"</p>

<p>"You are not aware," said Idomeneus, "of how little use

<!-- page 377 -->

experience is to indolent and effeminate princes, who are equally
averse to business and reflection. They are, indeed, dissatisfied
with every thing; but, for want of resolution, they reform
nothing. Habitual connection with these men, which many
years had confirmed, at length bound me to them by shackles
that I could not break. As soon as I came hither they precipitated
me into that excessive expense of which you have
been witness; they have exhausted the strength of this rising
State; they involved me in the war, which, without your assistance,
must have destroyed me. I should soon have experienced
at Salentum the same misfortunes which banished me from
Crete; but you have at once opened my eyes, and inspired me
with resolution. In your presence, I am conscious of an influence
for which I cannot account; I feel myself a new being in
a more exalted state."</p>

<p>Mentor then asked Idomeneus how Protesilaus had behaved
during the change of measures which had lately taken place.
"He has behaved," replied Idomeneus, "with the most refined
subtlety. When you first arrived, he labored to excite my suspicions
by indirect insinuations. He alleged nothing against
you himself; but now one, and then another, were perpetually
coming to tell me that the two strangers were much to be
feared. 'One of them,' said they, 'is the son of the crafty and
designing Ulysses; the other seems to have deep designs, and
to be of a dark and involved spirit. They have been accustomed
to wander from one kingdom to another, and who knows
but they have formed some design against this? It appeals
even by their own account that they have been the cause of
great troubles in the countries through which they have passed;
and we should remember that this State is still in its infancy,
that it is not firmly established, and that a slight commotion
would overturn it.'</p>

<p>"Upon this subject Protesilaus was silent; but he took great
pains to convince me that the reformation which, by your advice
I had begun, was dangerous and extravagant. He urged
me by arguments drawn for my particular interest. 'If you
place your people,' said he, 'in a state of such ease and plenty

<!-- page 378 -->

they will labor no more; they will become insolent, intractable
and factious; weakness and distress only can render them
supple and obedient.' He frequently endeavored to gain his
point by assuming his former ascendency over me; but he concealed
it under an appearance of zeal for my service. 'By
easing your people,' said he, 'you will degrade the regal authority;
and this will be an irreparable injury, even to the
people themselves; for nothing but keeping them in the lowest
subjection can preserve them from the restlessness of discontent
and the turbulence of faction.'</p>

<p>"To all this I replied that I could easily keep the people to
their duty by making them love me; by exerting all my
authority without abusing it; by steadily punishing all offenders;
by taking care that children should be properly educated;
and by maintaining such discipline among the people as should
render life simple, sober, and laborious. 'What!' said I, 'can
no people be kept in subjection but those that are perishing
with hunger? Does the art of government exclude kindness,
and must the politician be necessarily divested of humanity!
How many nations do we see governed with a gentle hand, yet
inflexibly loyal to their prince! Faction and revolt are the
effects of restlessness and ambition in the great, whose passions
have been indulged to excess, and who have been suffered to
turn freedom into license,&mdash;of the effeminacy, luxury, and idleness
of great numbers of all ranks,&mdash;of too large a military
establishment, which must consist of persons wholly unacquainted
with every occupation that can be useful in a time of
peace,&mdash;and chiefly of the wrongs of an injured people, whom
intolerable oppression has at last made desperate. The severity,
the pride, and the indolence of princes, which render them
incapable of that comprehensive vigilance, which alone can
prevent disorder in the State, are the first causes of tumult and
insurrection, and not the secure and peaceful repast of the husbandman
upon that bread which he has obtained by the sweat
of his brow.'</p>

<p>"When Protesilaus perceived that in these principles I was
inflexible, he totally changed his method of attack; he began

<!-- page 379 -->

to act upon those very maxims which he had labored in vain
to subvert; he pretended to adopt them from conviction, and
with a relish, and expressed great obligations to me for removing
his prejudices and throwing new light upon his mind.
He anticipates my very wishes, and, in order to relieve the
poor, he is the first to represent their necessity, and to exclaim
against unnecessary expense. He is even, as you know, eloquent
in your praise; he expresses the greatest confidence in
your wisdom and integrity, and neglects nothing that he thinks
will give you pleasure. His friendship with Timocrates seems
to decline; Timocrates is endeavoring to throw off his dependence;
Protesilaus has become jealous of him; and it is partly
by their disagreement that I have discovered their treachery."</p>

<p>"You have, then," said Mentor, with a smile, "been weak
enough to suffer even by detected villainy, and to continue
subservient to traitors after you knew their treason." "Alas!"
responded Idomeneus, "you do not know the power of artful
men over a weak and indolent prince, who has put the whole
management of his affairs into their hands. Besides, Protesilaus,
as I have just told you, now enters with great zeal into all
your projects for the general advantage of the State."</p>

"I know but too well," said Mentor, with a look of some
severity, "that of those that surround a prince the wicked prevail
over the good. Of this truth you are yourself a terrible
example. You say that I have opened your eyes to your true
interest, yet you are still so blind as to trust the administration
of your government to a wretch that is not fit to live. It is
time you should learn that a man may perform good actions
and be still wicked; that men of the worst principles and dispositions
do good, when it serves their purpose, with the same
facility as evil. It is true that they do evil without reluctance,
because they are withheld neither by sentiment nor principle;
but it is also true that they do good without violence to themselves,
because the success even of their vices depends upon
appearances of virtue which they do not possess, and because
they gratify their own depravity while they are deceiving mankind.
They are, however, incapable of virtue, though they

<!-- page 380 -->

appear to practise it; they can only add to every other vice
that which is more odious than all&mdash;hypocrisy. While you
continue resolute and peremptory that good shall be done,
Protesilaus will do good to preserve his authority; but if he
perceives the least tendency to relaxation, he will seize, and
with all his powers improve, the opportunity to bewilder you
again in perplexity and error, and resume his natural dissimulation
and ferocity. Is it possible that you should live with
honor or in peace while you see such a wretch as Protesilaus
forever at your side, and remember that Philocles, the faithful
and the wise, still lives in poverty and disgrace at Samos?</p>

<p>"You acknowledge, O Idomeneus, that princes are overborne
and misled by bold and designing men that are about
them; but you should not forget that princes are liable to another
misfortune, by no means inferior&mdash;a propensity to forget
the virtues and the services of those that are absent. Princes,
being continually surrounded by a multitude, are not forcibly
impressed by any individual: they are struck only with what
is present and pleasing; the remembrance of every thing else
is soon obliterated. Virtue affects them less than any other
object, for virtue can seldom please, as it opposes and condemns
their follies. Princes love nothing but pomp and pleasure;
and who, therefore, can wonder that princes are not beloved!"</p>

<p>After this conversation, Mentor persuaded Idomeneus immediately
to dismiss Protesilaus and Timocrates, and to recall
Philocles. The king would immediately have complied, if
there had not been a severity of virtue in Philocles, of which
he feared the effects. "I confess," said he, "that though I
love and esteem him, I cannot perfectly reconcile myself to
his return. I have, even from my infancy, been accustomed
to praise; assiduity, and compliances, which, in Philocles, I
shall not find. Whenever I took any measures that he disapproved,
the dejection of his countenance was sufficient to condemn
me. When we were together in private, his behavior
was respectful and decent, indeed, but it was ungracious and
austere."</p>

<p>"Do you not see," replied Mentor, "that to princes who

<!-- page 381 -->

have been spoiled by flattery, every thing that is sincere and
honest appears to be ungracious and austere? Such princes
are even weak enough to suspect a want of zeal for their service,
and respect for their authority, where they do not find a
servility that is ready to flatter them in the abuse of their
power. They are offended at all freedom of speech, all generosity
of sentiment, as pride, censoriousness, and sedition. They
contract a false delicacy, which every thing short of flattery
disappoints and disgusts. But let us suppose that Philocles
is really ungracious and austere, will not his austerity be
preferable to the pernicious flattery of those that are now
about you? Where will you find a man without fault? And
is not the fault of speaking truth a little too roughly and freely,
one from which you have less to fear than from any other?
Is it not, indeed, a fault which your own indiscretion has made
necessary to your interest, as that only which can surmount
the aversion to truth that flattery has given you? You stand
in need of a man who loves only truth and you; who loves
you better than you know how to love yourself; who will
speak truth notwithstanding your opposition, and force a way
for it through all your intrenchments. Such a man, and so
necessary, is Philocles. Remember, that the greatest good
fortune a prince can hope is, that one man of such magnanimous
generosity should be born in his reign. In comparison
with such a man, all the treasures of the State are of no value,
and a prince can suffer no punishment so dreadful as that of
losing him, by becoming unworthy of his virtue, and not
knowing how to profit by his services.</p>

<p>"You ought certainly to avail yourself of worthy men,
though it is not necessary that you should be blind to their
faults; in these never implicitly acquiesce, but endeavor to
correct them. Give merit, however, always a favorable hearing,
and let the public see that you at once distinguish and
honor it. But, above all things, strive to be no longer what
you have been. Princes, whose virtues, like yours, have suffered
by the vices of others, generally content themselves with
a speculative disapprobation of corrupt men, and at the same

<!-- page 382 -->

time employ them with the utmost confidence, and load them
with riches and honor. On the other hand, they value themselves
upon discerning and approving men of virtue, but they
reward them only with empty praise, and want magnanimity
to assign them employments, to admit them to their friendship,
or distinguish them by their favor."</p>

<p>Idomeneus then confessed that he was ashamed of having
so long delayed to deliver innocence from oppression, and to
punish those that had abused his confidence. All the scruples
about recalling Philocles being removed, Mentor had no difficulty
in persuading the king to dismiss his favorite; for, when
once an opposition to a favorite has so far succeeded that he
is suspected and becomes troublesome, the prince, feeling himself
perplexed and uneasy, thinks only how to get rid of him:
all friendship vanishes, and all services are forgotten. The fall
of a favorite gives no pain to his master, if, as soon as he is
undone, he is removed out of sight.</p>

<p>Idomeneus immediately gave private orders to Hegesippus,
one of the principal officers of his household, to seize Protesilaus
and Timocrates, and conduct them in safety to the isle of
Samos; to leave them there, and to bring Philocles back to
Salentum. Hegesippus, at the receipt of this order, burst into
tears of surprise and joy. "You will now," said he to the
king, "make every heart in your dominions glad. These men
were the cause of all the misfortunes that have befallen you
and your people. Good men have now groaned, twenty years,
under an oppression so severe, that they scarcely dared even
to groan. To complain was impossible; for those who attempted
to approach you, otherwise than by the favorites,
were sure to be immediately crushed by their power."</p>

<p>Hegesippus then acquainted the king with innumerable
instances of their treachery and inhumanity, of which he had
never heard, because nobody dared to accuse them. He told
him, also, that he had discovered a conspiracy against the life
of Mentor.  The king was struck with horror at the relation.</p>

<p>Hegesippus, that he might seize Protesilaus without delay,
went immediately to his house. It was not so large as the

<!-- page 383 -->

palace, but it was better designed, both for convenience and
pleasure: the architecture was in better taste, and it was
decorated with a profusion of expense, which the most cruel
oppression had supplied. He was then in a marble saloon
that opened to his baths, reclining negligently upon a couch
that was covered with purple embroidered with gold: he appeared
to be weary, and even exhausted with his labors; there
was a gloom of discontent upon his brow, and his eye expressed
a kind of agitation and ferocity not to be described. The
principal persons of the kingdom sat round him upon carpets,
watching his looks even to the slightest glance of his eye, and
reflecting every expression of his countenance from their own.
If he opened his mouth, all was ecstasy and admiration; and,
before he had uttered a word, they vied with each other which
should be loudest in the praise of what he had to say. One
of them regaled him with an account of the services he had
rendered to the king, heightened with the most ridiculous
exaggeration. Another declared that his mother had conceived
him by Jupiter in the likeness of her husband, and that
he was son to the father of the gods. In some verses that
were recited by a poet, he was said to have been instructed
by the Muses, and to have rivalled Apollo in all the works of
imagination and wit. Another poet, still more servile and
shameless, celebrated him as the inventor of the fine arts, and
the father of a people among whom he had scattered plenty
and happiness, from the horn of Amalthea, with a liberal hand.</p>

<p>Protesilaus heard all this adulation with a cold, negligent,
and disdainful air, as if he thought his merit was without
bounds, and that he honored those too much from whom he
condescended to receive praise. Among other flatterers, there
was one who took the liberty to whisper some jest upon the
new regulations that were taking place under the direction of
Mentor. The countenance of Protesilaus relaxed into a smile,
and immediately the whole company laughed, though the
greater part knew nothing of what had been said. The countenance
of Protesilaus became again haughty and severe, and
every one shrank back into timidity and silence. Noblemen

<!-- page 384 -->

watched for the happy moment in which he would turn his
eye upon them, and permit them to speak. Having some
favor to ask, they discovered the greatest agitation and perplexity;
their supplicatory posture supplied the want of words,
and they seemed to be impressed with the same humility and
reverence as a mother who petitions the gods at their altar for
the life of an only son. Every countenance expressed a tender
complacency and admiration, but every heart concealed the
most implacable hatred.</p>

<p>At this moment Hegesippus entered the saloon, seized the
sword of Protesilaus, and acquainted him that he had the
king's orders to carry him to Samos. At these dreadful words,
all the arrogance of the favorite fell in a moment, like the
fragment of a rock that is broken from the summit of a mountain.
He threw himself at the feet of Hegesippus: he wept,
hesitated, faltered, trembled, and embraced the knees of a man
upon whom, an hour before, he would have disdained to turn
his eye. At the same time, his flatterers, who saw that his
ruin was complete and irreparable, insulted him with a meanness
and cruelty worthy of their adulation.</p>

<p>Hegesippus would not allow him time even to take leave of
his family, or to secure his private papers, which were all
seized and put into the king's hands. Timocrates was also
arrested at the same time, to his inexpressible surprise; for,
being upon ill terms with Protesilaus, he had not the least
apprehension of being involved in his ruin. They were both
carried on board a vessel which had been prepared to receive
them.</p>

<p>They arrived in safety at Samos, where Hegesippus left his
prisoners; and, to complete their misfortunes, he left them
together. Here, with a rancor natural to their circumstances
and disposition, they reproached each other with the crimes
that had brought on their ruin. Here they were condemned
to live, without the least hope of returning to Salentum, at a
distance from their wives and children, not to mention friends,
for a friend they never had. With the country they were
wholly unacquainted, and had no means of subsistence but by

<!-- page 385 -->

their labor&mdash;a situation of which the disadvantages were greatly
aggravated by past luxury and splendor, which long habit had
made almost as necessary to them as food and rest. In this
condition, like two wild beasts of the forest, they were always
ready to tear each other to pieces.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Hegesippus inquired in what part of the
island Philocles was to be found. He was told that he lived
at a considerable distance from the city, upon a mountain, in
which there was a cave that served him for a habitation.
Every one spoke of him with admiration and esteem. "He
has never given offence," said they, "in a single instance, since
he has been in the island; every heart is touched at the
patience of his labor and the cheerfulness of his indigence:
he possesses nothing, yet is always content. Though he is
remote both from the business and the pleasures of the world,
without property and without influence, yet he can still find
means to oblige merit, and has a thousand contrivances to
gratify his neighbors."</p>

<p>Hegesippus immediately repaired to the cave, which he
found empty and open; for the poverty of Philocles, and the
simplicity of his manners, made it unnecessary for him to shut
his door when he went out. A mat of coarse rushes served
him for a bed. He rarely kindled a fire, because his food was
generally such as needed no dressing: in summer he lived
upon freshly-gathered fruits, and upon dried dates and figs in
winter. He quenched his thirst at a clear spring that fell in
a natural cascade from the rock. His cave contained nothing
but the tools necessary for sculpture, and some books that he
read at certain hours, which he appropriated to that purpose,
not to adorn his mind or gratify his curiosity, but that,
while he rested from his labor, he might gain instruction, and
avoid being idle by learning to be good. He employed himself
in sculpture, not to procure reputation or wealth, but
merely to keep his body in exercise, and procure the necessaries
of life without contracting obligations.</p>

<p>When Hegesippus entered the cave, he admired the pieces
of art that were begun. He observed a Jupiter, on whose

<!-- page 386 -->

countenance there was a serene majesty, by which he was immediately
known to be the father of the gods and men. He
perceived also a Mars, well distinguished by a proud and
menacing ferocity. But he was most struck with a Minerva,
represented as encouraging the arts: the expression of the
countenance was at once noble and gracious, the stature was
lofty and free, and the action so natural that the spectator was
almost persuaded she would move.</p>

<p>Hegesippus, having viewed these statues with great pleasure,
retired; and, as he was coming out of the cave, saw Philocles
at a distance, sitting upon the grass, under the shade of a large
tree, and reading. He immediately advanced towards him,
and Philocles, who perceived him, scarcely knew what to think.
"Is not that Hegesippus," said he to himself, "with whom I
was so long familiar at Crete? But what can have brought
him to an island so remote as Samos? Is he not dead, and is
not this his shade which has returned from the banks of the
Styx to revisit the earth?"</p>

<p>While he was thus doubting of what he saw, Hegesippus
came so near that his doubts were dispelled. "Is it you then,"
said he, embracing him, "my dear, my early friend? What
accident, or what tempest, has thrown you upon this coast?
Have you voluntarily deserted the island of Crete, or have
you been driven from your country by misfortune like mine?"</p>

<p>"It is not misfortune," said Hegesippus, "but the favor of the
gods, that has brought me hither." He then gave his friend a
particular account of the long tyranny of Protesilaus, of his
intrigues with Timocrates, of the calamities which they had
brought upon Idomeneus, of his expulsion from the throne,
his flight to Hesperia, the founding of Salentum, the arrival of
Mentor and Telemachus, the wisdom which Mentor had diffused
into the mind of the king, and the disgrace of the traitors
by whom he had been abused. He added, that he had brought
them in exile to Samos, whither they had banished Philocles;
and concluded, that he had orders to bring him back to
Salentum, where the king, who was convinced of his integrity,
intended to intrust him with the administration of his

<!-- page 387 -->

government, and distinguish him by rewards adequate to his
merit.</p>

<p>"You see that cave," said Philocles, "which is more fit for
the haunt of wild beasts than for the habitation of a man;
and yet in that cave I have enjoyed more tranquillity and repose
than in the gorgeous palaces of Crete. I am no more
deceived by man, for with man I have no more connection.
I neither see, nor hear, nor need him: my own hard hands,
which are now inured to labor, supply me with such simple food
as nature has made necessary; and, this slight stuff that you see
sufficing to cover me, I am without wants. I enjoy a serene,
perfect, and delightful freedom, of which the wisdom that is
contained in my books teaches me the proper use. Why then
should I again mix with mankind, and again suffer by their
jealousy, fraud, and caprice? Envy not, my dear Hegesippus,
the good fortune I possess. Protesilaus has betrayed the king,
and would have murdered me: he has fallen into his own
snare, but he has done me no harm; he has on the contrary
done me the greatest good; he has delivered me from the
tumult and slavery of public business: to him I am indebted
for this sweet solitude, and the innocent pleasures I enjoy.</p>

<p>"Return, then, my friend, to your prince; assist him under
the necessary infelicities of grandeur, and do for him whatever
you wish should be done by me. Since his eyes, which were
so long shut against truth, have been at last opened by the
wisdom of a person whom you call Mentor, let him also keep
that person about him. As for me, having once suffered shipwreck,
it is by no means fit that I should forsake the port in
which the tempest has so fortunately thrown me, and tempt
again the caprice of the winds. Alas! how much are kings
to be pitied! how worthy of compassion are those that serve
them! If they are wicked, what misery do they diffuse among
others, and what punishment do they treasure up for themselves
in black Tartarus! If they are good, what difficulties
have they to surmount, what snares to avoid, what evils to
suffer! Once more, my dear Hegesippus, leave me in my
happy poverty."</p>

<!-- page 388 -->

<p>Philocles expressed these sentiments with great vehemence,
and Hegesippus looked upon him with astonishment. He had
known him in Crete, when he conducted the business of the
State, and he was then pale, languishing, and emaciated: the natural
ardor of his temper, and his scrupulous regard to rectitude,
made a public station fatal to his health. He could not see
vice go unpunished without indignation, nor suffer unavoidable
irregularities without regret. At Crete, therefore, he suffered
a perpetual decay. But at Samos he was vigorous and lusty;
a new youth, in spite of years, bloomed upon his countenance;
a life of temperance, tranquillity, and exercise seemed to have
restored the constitution which nature had given him.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to see me so altered," said Philocles,
with a smile; "but I owe this freshness, this perfection of
health, to my retirement: my enemies, therefore, have given
me more than fortune could bestow. Can you wish me to
forsake substantial for imaginary good, and incur again the
misfortunes from which it is now my happiness to be free?
You would not, surely, be more cruel than Protesilaus; you
cannot envy me the good fortune that he has bestowed."</p>

<p>Hegesippus then urged him from every motive that he
thought likely to touch his sensibility, but without effect.
"Would the sight of your family and friends, then," said he,
"give you no pleasure; of those who languish for your return,
and live but in the hope of once more pressing you to their
bosom? And is it nothing for you, who fear the gods and
make a conscience of your duty, to render service to your
prince, to assist him in the exercise of virtue and in the diffusion
of happiness? Is it blameless to indulge an unsocial philosophy,
to prefer your own interest to that of mankind, and
choose rather to procure ease for yourself than to give happiness
to others? Besides, if you persist in your resolution not to
return, it will be imputed to resentment against the king. If he
intended evil against you, it was only because he was a stranger
to your merit: it was not Philocles, the faithful, the just,
the good, that he would have cut off, but a man of whom he
had conceived a very different idea. He now knows you, and it

<!-- page 389 -->

being now impossible he should now mistake you for another,
his first friendship will revive with new force. He expects
you with impatience; his arms are open to receive you; he
numbers the days, and even the hours of your delay. Can
you then be inexorable to your king? Can your heart resist
the tender solicitudes of friendship?"</p>

<p>Philocles, whom the first recollection of Hegesippus had
melted into tenderness, now resumed a look of distance and
severity. He remained immovable as a rock against which
the tempest rages in vain, and the roaring surge dashes only
to be broken; neither entreaty nor argument found any passage
to his heart. But the piety of Philocles would not suffer
him to indulge his inclination, however supported by his judgment,
without consulting the gods. He discovered, by the
flight of birds, by the entrails of victims, and by other presages,
that it was their pleasure he should go with Hegesippus.</p>

He therefore resisted no more, but complied with the request
of Hegesippus, and prepared for his departure. He did
not, however, quit the solitude in which he had lived so many
years without regret. "Must I then," said he, "forsake this
pleasing cell, where peaceful and obedient slumbers came
every night to refresh me after the labors of the day&mdash;where
my easy life was a silken thread which the Fates, notwithstanding
my poverty, entwined with gold!" The tears started to
his eyes, and prostrating himself on the earth, he adored the
Naiad of the translucent spring that had quenched his thirst,
and the Nymphs of the mountains that surrounded his retreat.
Echo heard his expressions of tenderness and regret, and, with
a gentle and plaintive voice, repeated them to all the sylvan
deities of the place.</p>

<p>Philocles then accompanied Hegesippus to the city, in order
to embark. He thought that Protesilaus, overwhelmed with
confusion, and burning with resentment, would be glad to
avoid him, but he was mistaken: men without virtue are without
shame, and always ready to stoop to any meanness.
Philocles modestly concealed himself, for fear the unhappy

<!-- page 390 -->

wretch should see him: he supposed that to see the prosperity
of an enemy, which was founded on his ruin, would
aggravate his misery. But Protesilaus sought him out with
great eagerness, and endeavored to excite his compassion, and
to engage him to solicit the king for permission to return to
Salentum. Philocles, however, was too sincere to give him the
least hope that he would comply; for he knew, better than
any other, the mischiefs that his return would produce; but he
soothed him with expressions of pity, offered him such consolation
as his situation would admit, and exhorted him to propitiate
the gods by purity of manners and resignation to his
sufferings. As he had heard that the king had taken from him
all the wealth that he had unjustly acquired, he promised him
two things, which he afterwards faithfully performed,&mdash;to take
his wife and children, who remained at Salentum, exposed to
all the miseries of poverty and all the dangers of popular
resentment, under his protection; and to send him some supplies
of money to alleviate the distress he must suffer in a state
of banishment so remote from his country.</p>

<p>The wind being fair, Hegesippus hastened the departure of
his friend. Protesilaus saw them embark. His eyes were
fixed upon the sea, and pursued the vessel, as, driven by the
wind, she made her way through the parting waves, and every
moment receded. When he could distinguish the ship no
more, its image was still impressed upon his mind. At last,
seized with the phrensy of despair, he rolled himself in the
sands, tore his hair, and reproached the gods for the severity
of their justice. He called upon Death, but even Death
rejected his petition, and disdained to deliver him from the
misery from which he wanted courage to deliver himself.</p>

<p>In the mean time the vessel, favored by Neptune and the
winds, soon arrived at Salentum. When the king was told
that it was entering the port, he ran out with Mentor to meet
Philocles, whom he tenderly embraced, and expressed the utmost
regret at having so unjustly persecuted him. This acknowledgment
was so far from degrading him in the opinion of
the people, that every one considered it as the effort of an

<!-- page 391 -->

exalted mind, which, as it were, triumphed over its own failings
by confessing them with a view to reparation. The public
joy at the return of Philocles, the friend of man, and at the
wisdom and goodness expressed by the king, was so great that
it overflowed in tears.</p>

<p>Philocles received the caresses of his prince with the most
respectful modesty, and was impatient to escape from the
acclamations of the people. He followed Idomeneus to the
palace, and though Mentor and he had never seen each other
before, there was immediately the same confidence between
them as if they had been familiar from their birth. The gods,
who have withheld from the wicked the power of recognizing
the good, have imparted to the good a faculty of immediately
recognizing each other. Those who have a love for virtue
cannot be together without being united by that virtue which
they love.</p>

<p>Philocles, after a short time, requested the king to dismiss
him to some retirement near Salentum, where he might live in
the same obscurity he had enjoyed at Samos. The king
granted his request, but went almost every day with Mentor to
visit him in his retreat, where they consulted how the laws
might best be established, and the government fixed upon a
permanent foundation for the advantage of the people.</p>

<p>The two principal objects of their consultation were, the
education of children, and the manner of life to be prescribed
during peace.</p>

<p>As to the children, Mentor said: "They belong less to their
parents than to the State; they are the children of the community,
and they are at once its hope and its strength. It is
too late to correct them when habits of vice have been acquired:
it is doing little to exclude them from employments when they
have become unworthy of trust. It is always better to prevent
evil than to punish it. The prince who is the father of
his people is, more particularly, the father of the youth, who
may be considered as the flower of the nation. It is in the
flower that care should be taken of the fruit; a king, therefore,
should not disdain to watch over the rising generation,

<!-- page 392 -->

nor to appoint others to watch with him. Let him enforce
with inflexible constancy the laws of Minos, which ordain that
children shall be so educated as to endure pain without impatience,
and expect death without terror,&mdash;that contempt of
luxury and wealth shall be honor,&mdash;that injustice, ingratitude,
and voluptuous idleness shall be infamy,&mdash;that children, from
their tenderest youth, shall be taught to commemorate the
achievements of heroes, the favorites of heaven, who have
sacrificed private interest to their country, and signalized their
courage in battle,&mdash;that their souls shall be moved by the
charm of music, to render their manners gentle and pure,&mdash;that
they shall learn to be tender to their friends, faithful to their
allies, and equitable to all men, their enemies not excepted;
that above all, they shall be taught to dread the reproach of
conscience, as an evil much greater than torture or death. If
these maxims are impressed early upon the heart, with all the
power of eloquence and the charms of music, there will be
few, indeed, in whom they will not kindle the love of virtue
and of fame.</p>

<p>"It is," added Mentor, "of the utmost importance to establish
public schools for inuring youth to the most robust exercises,
and preserving them from effeminacy and idleness, which
render the most liberal endowments of nature useless." He
advised the institution of public games and shows, with as much
variety as could be contrived, to rouse the attention and interest
the feelings of the people, but, above all, to render the body
supple, vigorous, and active; and he thought it proper to
excite emulation, by giving prizes to those that should excel.
He wished also, as the most powerful preservative against
general depravity of manners, that the people should marry
early; and that parents, without any views of interest, would
leave the young men to the free choice of such wives as their
inclination naturally led them to prefer."</p>

<p>But while these measures were concerted to preserve a
blameless simplicity among the rising generation, to render
them laborious and tractable, and, at the same time, to give
them a sense of honor, Philocles, whose military genius made

<!-- page 393 -->

him fond of war, observed to Mentor that it would signify
little to institute public exercises, if the youth were suffered to
languish in perpetual peace, without bringing their courage to
the test, or requiring experience in the field. "The nation,"
said he, "will be insensibly enfeebled; courage will relax into
effeminate softness; a general depravity, the necessary effect
of uninterrupted abundance and tranquillity, will render them
an easy prey to any warlike nation that shall attack them,
and, aiming to avoid the miseries of war, they will incur the
most deplorable slavery."</p>

<p>"The calamities of war," said Mentor, "are more to be
dreaded than you imagine. War never fails to exhaust the
State and endanger its destruction, with whatever success it is
carried on. Though it may be commenced with advantage, it
can never be finished without danger of the most fatal reverse
of fortune. With whatever superiority of strength an engagement
is begun, the least mistake, the slightest accident, may
turn the scale, and give victory to the enemy. Nor can a
nation that should be always victorious prosper; it would
destroy itself by destroying others: the country would be
depopulated, the soil untilled, and trade interrupted; and,
what is still worse, the best laws would lose their force, and a
corruption of manners insensibly take place. Literature will
be neglected among the youth; the troops, conscious of their
own importance, will indulge themselves in the most pernicious
licentiousness with impunity; and the disorder will necessarily
spread through all the branches of government. A prince
who, in the acquisition of glory, would sacrifice the life of half
his subjects and the happiness of the rest, is unworthy of the
glory he would acquire, and deserves to lose what he rightfully
possesses for endeavoring unjustly to usurp the possessions of
another.</p>

<p>"It is, however, easy to exercise the courage of the people
in a time of peace. We have already instituted public exercises,
and assigned prizes to excite emulation; we have directed
that the achievements of the brave shall be celebrated in songs
to their honor, which will kindle, in the breasts even of children,

<!-- page 394 -->

a desire of glory, and animate them to the exercise of
heroic virtue; we have also taken care that they shall be
inured to sobriety and labor: but this is not all. When any
of your allies shall be engaged in war, the flower of your youth,
particularly those who appear to have a military genius, and
will profit most by experience, should be sent as auxiliaries
into the service. You will thus stand high in the estimation
of the States with which you are connected; your friendship
will be sought, and your displeasure dreaded; without being
engaged in war in your own country and at your own expense,
you will always have a youth trained to war and courageous,
Though you are at peace yourselves, you should treat, with
great honor, those who have distinguished abilities for war;
for the best way of keeping war at a distance is to encourage
military knowledge; to honor those who excel in the profession
of arms; to have some of your people always in foreign service,
who will know the strength and discipline of the neighboring
States, and the manner of their military operations; to
be, at once, superior to the ambition that would court war, and
to the effeminacy that would fear it. Thus, being always prepared
for war when you are driven into it by necessity, you
will find that the necessity of making war will seldom happen.</p>

<p>"When your allies are about to make war upon each other,
you should always interfere as mediator. You will thus acquire
a genuine and lasting glory, which sanguinary conquest can
never give: you will gain the love and esteem of foreign nations,
and become necessary to them all; you will rule other
States by the confidence they place in you, as you govern your
own by the authority of your station; you will be the common
repository of their secrets, the arbiter of their differences, and
the object of their love; your fame will then fly to the
remotest regions of the earth, and your name, like a delicious
perfume, shall be wafted from clime to clime, as far as virtue
can be known and loved. If, in possession of this influence
and this honor, a neighboring nation should, contrary to all
the rules of justice, commence hostilities against you, it will
find you disciplined and ready, and, what is yet more effectual

<!-- page 395 -->

strength, beloved and succored when you are in danger; your
neighbors will be alarmed for themselves, and consider your
preservation as essential to public safety. This will be your
security, in comparison with which walls and ramparts are no
defence; this is true glory. But few kings have recognized
and pursued it&mdash;few have not left it unknown behind them,
to follow an illusive phantom, still more distant from the prize
in proportion to their speed."</p>

<p>When Mentor had done speaking, Philocles fixed his eyes
upon him with an astonishment that prevented reply; then
looking upon the king, he was delighted to perceive with what
avidity Idomeneus received in his inmost heart the words that
flowed, like a river of wisdom, from the stranger's lips.</p>

<p>Thus Minerva, under the figure of Mentor, established the
best laws and the wisest principles of government at Salentum;
not so much that the kingdom of Idomeneus might flourish, as
to show Telemachus, when he should return, a striking example
of what may be effected by a wise government to render nations
happy, and give to a king enduring glory.</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb12">BOOK XII.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus, in the camp of the allies, gains the friendship of Philoctetes
who was not at first favorably disposed to him, on his father's account.
Philoctetes relates his adventures, and introduces a particular account
of the death of Hercules by the poisoned garment which the centaur
Nessus had given to Dejanira. He relates how he obtained from that
hero his poisoned arrows, without which the city of Troy could not have
been taken; how he was punished for betraying his secret, by various
sufferings, in the island of Lemnos; and how Ulysses employed Neoptolemus
to engage him in the expedition against Troy, where he was cured
of his wound.</p>

<p>COURAGE, in the mean time, was displayed by Telemachus
amid the perils of war. As soon as he had quitted Salentum,
he applied himself with great diligence to gain the esteem of
the old commanders, whose reputation and experience were
consummate. Nestor, who had before seen him at Pylos, and
who had always loved Ulysses, treated him as if he had been
his son. He gave him many lessons of instruction, and illustrated
his precepts by examples; he related all the adventures
of his youth, and told him the most remarkable achievements
which he had seen performed by the heroes of the preceding
age. The memory of Nestor, who had lived to see three generations,
contained the history of ancient times with the same
fidelity as an inscription upon marble or brass.</p>

<p>Philoctetes did not at first regard Telemachus with the same
kindness; the enmity which he had so long cherished in his
breast against Ulysses, prejudiced him against his son; and he
could not see without pain that the gods appeared to interest
themselves in his fortunes, and to intend him a glory equal to
that of the heroes by whom Troy had been overthrown. But
the unaffected modesty of Telemachus at length surmounted
his resentment, and he could not but love that virtue which

<!-- page 397 -->

appeared so amiable and sweet. He frequently took Telemachus
aside and talked to him with the most unreserved confidence.
"My son," said he, "for I now make no scruple to
call you so, I must confess that your father and I have been
long enemies to each other. I acknowledge also that my enmity
was not softened by mutual danger and mutual success,
for it continued unabated after we had laid Troy in ruins; and
when I saw you, I found it difficult to love even virtue in the
son of Ulysses. I have often reproached myself for this reluctance,
which, however, I still felt; but virtue, when it is gentle,
placid, ingenuous, and unassuming, must at last compel affection
and esteem." Philoctetes, in the course of these conversations,
was insensibly led to acquaint Telemachus with what
had given rise to the animosity between him and Ulysses.</p>

<p>"It is necessary," said he, "that I should tell my story from
the beginning. I was the inseparable companion of Hercules,
the great example of divine virtue, the destroyer of monsters,
whose prowess was a blessing to the earth, and compared with
whom all other heroes are but as reeds to the oak or sparrows
to the eagle. Love, a passion that has produced every species
of calamity, was the cause of his misfortunes, and his misfortunes
were the cause of mine. To this shameful passion the
virtues of Hercules were opposed in vain; and, after all his
conquests, he was himself the sport of Cupid. He never remembered,
without a blush of ingenuous shame, his having
laid by his dignity to spin in the chamber of Omphale, like the
most abject and effeminate of men. He has frequently deplored
this part of his life as having sullied his virtue, and obscured
the glory of his labors.</p>

<p>"Yet, such is the weakness and inconsistency of man, who
thinks himself all-sufficient and yields without a struggle, that
the great Hercules was again taken in the snare of love, and
sank again into a captivity which he had so often remembered
with indignation and contempt. He became enamored of Dejanira,
and would have been happy if he had continued constant
in his passion for this woman, whom he made his wife.
But the youthful beauty of Iole, to whom the Graces had given

<!-- page 398 -->

all their charms, soon seduced him to a new passion. Dejanira
became jealous, and unhappily recollected the fatal garment
which had been given her by Nessus, the centaur, when he
was dying, as a certain means of reviving the love of Hercules
if he should ever neglect her for another. This garment had
imbibed the blood of the centaur, to which the arrow that slew
him had communicated its poison. The arrows of Hercules,
you know, were dipped in the blood of the Lern&aelig;an hydra,
which gave them a malignity so powerful that the slightest
wound they could make was mortal.</p>

<p>"As soon as Hercules had put on the garment, he felt the
poison burn even to the marrow in the bone; he cried out in
his agony with a voice more than human; the sound was
returned by Mount &OElig;ta, the echo deepened in the valleys, and
the sea itself seemed to be moved. The roar of the most
furious bulls when they fight, was not so dreadful as the cries
of Hercules. Lycas, who brought him the garment from
Dejanira, happening unfortunately to approach him, he seized
him in the distraction of his torments, and whirling him round,
as a slinger whirls a stone that he would hurl with all his
strength, he threw him from the top of the mountain, and, falling
into the sea, he was immediately transformed into a rock,
which still retains the figure of a man, and which, still beaten
by the surge, alarms the pilot, while he is yet distant from the
shore.<sup id="t_ref135"><a href="#t_en135">135</a></sup></p>

<p>"After the fate of Lycas I thought I could trust Hercules
no more, and therefore endeavored to conceal myself in the
caverns of the rock. From this retreat I saw him, with one
hand, root up the lofty pines that towered to the sky, and oaks
which had repelled the storms of successive generations, and,
with the other, endeavor to tear off the fatal garment which
adhered like another skin, and seemed to be incorporated with

<!-- page 399 -->

his body. In proportion as he tore it off, he tore off also the
flesh; his blood followed in a torrent, and the earth was impurpled
around him. But his virtue at length surmounted his
sense of pain, and he cried out: 'Thou art witness, O Philoctetes,
to the torments which the gods inflict upon me, and
they are just: I have offended heaven, and violated the vows
of connubial love. After all my conquests, I have meanly
given up my heart to forbidden beauty: I perish, and am content
to perish, that divine justice may be satisfied. But, alas!
my dear friend, whither art thou fled? Transported by excess
of pain, I have indeed destroyed unhappy Lycas, by an act of
cruelty for which I abhor myself: he was a stranger to the
poison that he brought me; he committed no crime, he deserved
no punishment. But could the sacred ties of friendship
be forgotten? could I attempt the life of Philoctetes? My
love for him can cease only with my life; into his breast will
I breathe my departing spirit, and to his care will I confide
my ashes. Where art thou, then, my dear Philoctetes?
where art thou, Philoctetes, the only object of my hope on
earth?'</p>

<p>"Struck with this. tender expostulation, I rushed towards
him, and he stretched out his arms to embrace me; yet, before
I reached him, he drew them back, lest he should kindle in my
bosom the fatal fires that consumed his own. 'Alas,' said he,
'even this consolation is denied me!' He then turned from
me, and collecting all the trees that he had rooted up into a
funeral pile upon the summit of the mountain, he ascended it
with a kind of dreadful tranquillity: he spread under him the
skin of the Nemean lion, which, while he was traversing the
earth from one extremity to the other, destroying monsters
and succoring distress, he had worn as a mantle, and reclining
upon his club, he commanded me to set fire to the wood.</p>

<p>"This command, though I trembled with horror, I could
not refuse to obey, for his misery was so great that life was no
longer a bounty of heaven. I feared that, in the extremity of
his torment, he might do something unworthy of the virtue
which had astonished the world. When he perceived that the

<!-- page 400 -->

pile had taken fire, he said: 'Now, my dear Philoctetes, I
know that thy friendship is sincere, for my honor is dearer to
thee than my life. May thy reward be from heaven! I give
thee all I can bestow: these arrows, dipped in the blood of
the Lern&aelig;an hydra, I valued more than all that I possessed,
and they are thine. Thou knowest that the wounds which
they make are mortal; they rendered me invincible, and so
they will render thee; nor will any man dare to lift up his
hand against thee. Remember that I die faithful to our friendship,
and forget not how close I held thee to my heart. If
thou art indeed touched with my misfortunes, there is still one
consolation in thy power: promise to acquaint no man with
my death, and never to reveal the place where thou shalt hide
my ashes.' I promised, in an agony of tenderness and grief,
and I consecrated my promise by an oath. A beam of joy
sparkled in his eyes, but a sheet of flame immediately surrounded
him, stifled his voice, and almost hid him from my
sight. I caught, however, a glimpse of him through the
flame, and I perceived that his countenance was as serene as if
he had been surrounded with festivity and joy at the banquet
of a friend, covered with perfume, and crowned with flowers.</p>

"The flames quickly consumed his terrestrial and mortal
part. Of that nature which he had received from his mother
Alcmena, there were no remains; but he preserved, by the
decree of Jove, that pure and immortal essence, that celestial
flame, the true principle of life, which he had received from
the father of the gods. With the gods, therefore, he drank
immortality under the golden roofs of Olympus, and they gave
him Hebe to wife&mdash;the lovely Hebe, the goddess of youth,
who had filled the bowl of nectar to Jupiter, before that honor
was bestowed upon Ganymede.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, the arrows that had been given me as
a pledge of superior prowess and fame, proved an inexhaustible
source of misfortune. When the confederate princes of
Greece undertook to revenge the wrong done to Menelaus by
Paris, who had basely stolen away Helen, and to lay the kingdom
of Priam in ashes, they learned from the oracle of Apollo,

<!-- page 401 -->

that in this enterprise they would never succeed, if they did
not take with them the arrows of Hercules.</p>

<p>"Your father Ulysses, whose penetration and activity rendered
him superior in every council, undertook to persuade me
to accompany them to the siege of Troy, and to take the
arrows of Hercules, which he believed to be in my possession,
with me. It was now long since Hercules had appeared in
the world; no exploit of the hero was related; and monsters
and robbers began to appear with impunity. The Greeks
knew not what opinion to form concerning him; some affirmed
that he was dead; others that he had gone to subdue the
Scythians under the frozen bear. But Ulysses maintained
that he was dead, and engaged to make me confess it. He
came to me, while I was still lamenting the loss of my illustrious
friend with inconsolable sorrow; he found it extremely
difficult to speak to me; for I avoided the sight of mankind,
and could not think of quitting the deserts of Mount &OElig;ta,
where I had been witness to the death of Alcides: I was
wholly employed in forming his image in my mind, and weeping
at the remembrance of his sufferings, which every view of
these mournful places renewed. But upon the lips of your
father there was a sweet and irresistible eloquence; he seemed
to take an equal part in my affliction, and when I wept, he
wept with me; he gained upon my heart by an insensible
approach, and obtained my confidence even before I knew it.
He interested my tenderness for the Grecian princes, who had
undertaken a just war, in which, without me, they could not
be successful. He could not, however, draw from me the
secret that I had sworn to keep; but though I did not confess
it, he had sufficient evidence that Hercules was dead, and he
pressed me to tell him where I had concealed his ashes.</p>

<p>"I could not think of perjury without horror; and yet, alas!
I eluded the vow that I had made to Hercules and to heaven.
I discovered the place where I had deposited the remains of
the hero by striking it with my foot, and the gods have punished
me for the fraud. I then joined the confederates, who
received me with as much joy as they would have received

<!-- page 402 -->

Hercules himself. When we were on shore at the island of
Lemnos, I was willing to show the Greeks what my arrows
would do, and therefore prepared to shoot a deer which I
saw rush into the forest; but, by some accident, I let the shaft
slip out of my hand, and, falling on my foot, it gave me a
wound, of which I still feel the effects. I was immediately
seized with the same pains that had destroyed Hercules, and
the echoes of the island repeated my complaints day and night.
A black and corrupted blood flowed incessantly from my
wound, infected the air, and filled the camp with an intolerable
stench. The whole army was struck with horror at my
condition, and concluded it to be the just punishment of the
gods.</p>

<p>"Ulysses, who had engaged me in the expedition, was the
first to abandon me, as I have since learned, because he preferred
victory and the common interest of Greece to private
friendship and the punctilios of decorum. The horror of my
wound, the infection that it spread, and the dreadful cries that
it forced from me, produced such an effect upon the army that
it was no longer possible to sacrifice in the camp. But when
the Greeks abandoned me by the counsel of Ulysses, I considered
his policy as the most aggravated inhumanity, and the
basest breach of faith. I was blinded by prejudice and self-love,
and did not perceive that the wisest men were most
against me, and that the gods themselves had become my
enemies.</p>

<p>"I remained, during almost the whole time that Troy was
besieged, alone, without succor, without consolation, without
hope, the victim of intolerable anguish, in a desolate island,
where I saw no object but the rude productions of uncultivated
nature, and heard only the roaring of the surge that
broke against the rocks. In one of the mountains of this
desert I found a cavern in a rock, the summit of which towered
to the skies and was divided into a fork, and at the bottom
of which issued a spring of clear water. This cavern, my only
dwelling, was the retreat of wild beasts of various kinds, to
whose fury I was exposed night and day.  I gathered a few

<!-- page 403 -->

leaves together for my bed. My sole possessions were a
wooden vessel of the rudest workmanship, and a few tattered
garments which I wrapped round my wound to stanch the
blood, and used also to clean it. In this place, forsaken of
men and hateful to the gods, I sometimes endeavored to suspend
the sense of my misery by shooting at the pigeons and
other birds that flew around the rock. When I had brought
one to the ground, I crawled with great pain and difficulty to
take it up, that it might serve me for food: thus my own
hands provided me subsistence.</p>

<p>"The Greeks, indeed, left me some provisions when they
quitted the island; but these were soon exhausted. I dressed
such as I procured at a fire which I kindled by striking a flint;
and this kind of life, rude and forlorn as it was, would not have
been unpleasing to me&mdash;the ingratitude and perfidy of man
having reconciled me to solitude&mdash;if it had not been for the
pain that I endured from my wound, and the perpetual review
of my singular misfortunes. 'What!' said I to myself, 'seduce
a man from his country upon pretence that he alone can
avenge the cause of Greece, and then leave him in an uninhabited
island when he is asleep,'&mdash;for I was asleep when the
Greeks deserted me. Judge in what an agony of consternation
and grief I awaked, and saw their fleet standing from the
shore. I looked around me to find some gleam of comfort,
but all was desolation and despair.</p>

<p>"This island had neither port nor commerce, and was not
only without inhabitants, but without visitors, except such as
came by force. As none set foot on the shore but those
who were driven there by tempests, I could hope for society
only by shipwreck; and I knew that if distress should force
any unfortunate mariners upon the island, they would not dare
to take me with them when they left it, lest they should incur
the resentment, not only of the Greeks, but of the gods.
I suffered remorse, and pain, and hunger, ten years; I languished
with a wound that I could not cure, and hope itself
was extinguished in my breast.</p>

<p>"One day as I returned from seeking some medicinal herbs

<!-- page 404 -->

for my wound, I was surprised to find at the entrance of my
cave a young man of graceful appearance, but of a lofty and
heroic mien. I took him, at the first glance, for Achilles, whom
he greatly resembled in his features, aspect, and deportment:
I was convinced of my mistake only by his age. I observed
that his whole countenance expressed perplexity and compassion;
he was touched to see with what pain and difficulty I
crawled along, and his heart melted at my complaints, which
the echoes of the shore returned.</p>

<p>"I called out while I was yet at a distance: 'O stranger,
what misfortune has cast thee upon this island forsaken of
men? I know thy habit to be Grecian,&mdash;a habit which, in
spite of my wrongs, I love. Oh, let me hear thy voice, and
once more find upon thy lips that language which I learned in
infancy, and which this dreadful solitude has so long forbidden
me to speak. Let not my appearance alarm you, for the
wretch whom you behold is not an object of fear but of
pity.'</p>

<p>"The stranger had no sooner answered, 'I am a Greek,'
than I cried out: 'After such silence without associate, such
pain without consolation, how sweet is the sound! O my son,
what misfortune, what tempest or rather what favorable gale,
has brought thee hither to put an end to my sufferings?' He
replied, 'I am of the island of Scyros, whither I am about to
return, and it is said I am the son of Achilles: thou knowest all.'</p>

<p>"So brief a reply left my curiosity unsatisfied. 'O son of
Achilles,' said I, 'the friend of my heart, who wert fostered by
Lycomedes with the tenderness of a parent, whence art thou
come, and what has brought thee to this place?' 'I come,' he
replied, 'from the siege of Troy.' 'Thou wast not,' said I, 'in
the first expedition.' 'Wast thou in it, then?' said he. 'I
perceive,' said I, 'that thou knowest neither the name nor the
misfortunes of Philoctetes. Wretch that I am! my persecutors
insult me in my calamity. Greece is a stranger to my
sufferings, which every moment increase. The Atrides have
reduced me to this condition: may the gods reward them as
they deserve!'</p>

<!-- page 405 -->

<p>"I then related the manner in which I had been abandoned
by the Greeks. As soon as Neoptolemus had heard my complaints,
he made me the confidant of his own. 'After the death
of Achilles,' said he,&mdash;&mdash;'How!' said I, 'is Achilles dead?
Forgive the tears that interrupt you, for I owe them to the
memory of your father.' 'Such interruption,' replied Neoptolemus,
'is soothing to my sorrow: what can so much alleviate
my loss as the tears of Philoctetes?'</p>

<p>"Neoptolemus then resumed his story. 'After the death of
Achilles,' said he, 'Ulysses and Ph&oelig;nix came to me and told
me that Troy could not be taken till I came to the siege. I
was easily persuaded to go with them, for my grief for the
death of Achilles, and a desire of inheriting his glory in so
celebrated a war, were inducements that almost made persuasion
unnecessary. When I arrived at Sigeum, the whole army
gathered around me: every one was ready to swear that he
beheld Achilles; but, alas! Achilles was no more. In the
presumption of youth and inexperience, I thought I might
hope every thing from those who were so liberal of praise. I
therefore demanded my father's arms of the Atrides, but their
answer was a cruel disappointment of my expectations. 'You
shall have,' said they, 'whatever else belonged to your father;
but his arms are allotted to Ulysses.'</p>

<p>" 'This threw me into confusion, and tears, and rage. But
Ulysses replied, without emotion: 'You have not endured
with us the dangers of a tedious siege; you have not merited
such arms; you have demanded them too proudly, and they
shall never be yours.' My right being thus unjustly wrested
from me, I am returning to the isle of Scyros, yet more incensed
against the Atrides than against Ulysses. To all who
are their enemies may the gods be friends! And now, Philoctetes,
I have told thee all.'</p>

<p>"I then asked Neoptolemus how it happened that Ajax, the
son of Telamon, did not interpose to prevent such injustice?
'Ajax,' said he, 'is dead.'  'Is Ajax dead,' said I, 'and Ulysses
alive and prosperous?'  I then inquired after Antilochus, the
son of Nestor; and Patroclus, the favorite of Achilles.  'They

<!-- page 406 -->

also,' said he, 'are dead.' 'Alas!' said I, 'are Antilochus and
Patroclus dead? How does war, with unrelenting and undistinguishing
destruction, sweep away the righteous and spare
the wicked! Ulysses lives; and so, I doubt not, does Thersites.
Such is the ordination of the gods, and yet we still honor them
with praise.'</p>

<p>"While I was thus burning with resentment against your
father, Nooptolemus continued to deceive me. 'I am going,'
said he, with a mournful accent, 'to live content in the isle of
Scyros, which, though uncultivated and obscure, is yet far from
the armies of Greece, where evil prevails over good. Farewell!
may the gods vouchsafe to restore thy health!'</p>

<p>" 'O my son,' said I, 'I conjure thee by the manes of thy
father, by thy mother, and by all that is dear to thee upon
earth, not to leave me alone in this extremity of pain and sorrow.
I know I shall be a burden to you, but it would disgrace
your humanity to leave me here. Place me in the prow, the
stern, or even the hold of your vessel, wherever I shall least
offend you. Noble minds alone know how much glory there
is in doing good. Do not abandon me in a desert, where there
are no traces of men; take me with you to Scyros, or leave
me at Eub&aelig;a, where I shall be near to Mount &OElig;ta, to Trachin,
and the pleasing banks of Thessalian Sperchius, or send me
back to my father. Alas! I fear that my father may be dead.
I sent to him for a vessel, which has never arrived, and it is
therefore certain, either that he is dead, or that those who
promised to acquaint him with my distress have betrayed their
trust. My last hope is in thee, O my son! Consider the uncertainty
of all sublunary things: the prosperous should fear
to abuse prosperity, and never fail to succor the distress which
they are liable to feel.'</p>

<p>"Such, in the intolerable anguish of my mind, was my
address to Neoptolemus, and he promised to take me with
him. My heart then leaped for joy. 'O happy day!' I exclaimed;
'O amiable Neoptolemus! worthy to inherit the
glory of thy father! Ye dear companions, with whom I shall
return to the world of life, suffer me to bid this mournful

<!-- page 407 -->

retreat farewell. See where I have lived, and consider what I
have endured. My sufferings have been more than another
could sustain; but I was instructed by necessity, and she
teaches what otherwise could not be known. Those who are
without sufferings are without knowledge; they distinguish
neither good nor evil; they are alike ignorant of mankind and
of themselves.' After this effusion of my heart, I took my
bow and arrows in my hand.</p>

<p>"Neoptolemus then requested that I would permit him to
kiss the celebrated arms that had been consecrated by the invincible
Hercules. 'To you,' said I, 'all things are permitted;
you, my son, restore me to light and life, to my country, my
father, my friends, and myself: you may touch these arms,
and boast that you are the only Greek who deserves to touch
them.' Neoptolemus immediately came into my cell to admire
my arrows.</p>

<p>"At this moment a sudden pang totally suspended my
faculties: I no longer knew what I did, but called for a sword,
that I might cut off my foot. I cried out for death, and reproached
it with delay. 'Burn me,' said I to Neoptolemus,
'this moment, as I burned the son of Jove upon Mount &OElig;ta.
O earth, receive a dying wretch, who shall never more rise
from thy bosom!' I fell immediately to the ground without
appearance of life,&mdash;a state in which these fits of pain usually
left me: a profuse sweat at length relieved me, and a black
and corrupted blood flowed from my wound. While I continued
insensible, it would have been easy for Neoptolemus to
have carried off my arms; but he was the son of Achilles, and
his nature was superior to fraud.</p>

<p>"When I recovered, I perceived great confusion in his countenance:
he sighed like a man new to dissimulation, and practising
it with violence to himself. 'What!' said I, 'do you
meditate to take advantage of my infirmity?' 'You must go
with me,' said he, 'to the siege of Troy.' 'What do I hear!'
said I; 'I am betrayed. O my son, give me back the bow;
to withhold it is to rob me of life. Alas! he answers me
nothing; he looks steadily upon me, without emotion; over

<!-- page 408 -->

his heart I have no power. Ye winding shores! ye promontories
that overhang the deep! ye broken rocks! ye savage
beasts that haunt these scenes of desolation! I complain to
you; for, besides you, there are none to whom I can complain:
to you my groans are familiar. Must I be thus betrayed by
the son of Achilles? He robs me of the bow, which the hand
of Hercules has made sacred; he would drag me to the camp
of the Greeks, as a trophy of the war; he sees not that his
victory is not over the living but the dead, a shade, a vain
phantom! Oh, that he had assailed me when my vigor was
unimpaired; but even now he has taken me by surprise.
What expedient shall I try? Restore what thou hast taken;
restore my arms, O my son! and let thy conduct be worthy
of thy father and of thyself. What dost thou answer? Thou
art inexorably silent. To thee, thou barren rock, I once more
return, naked and miserable, forlorn and destitute! In this
cave I shall perish alone, for, having no weapon to destroy the
beasts, the beasts will inevitably devour me; and why should
I desire to live? But as to thee, my son, the mark of wickedness
is not upon thee; thou art surely the instrument of another's
hand.  Restore my arms, and leave me to my fate.'</p>

<p>"Neoptolemus was touched with my distress; the tear
started to his eye, and he sighed to himself: 'Would that
I had still continued at Scyros!' At this moment I cried
out: 'What do I see! surely that is Ulysses!' Immediately
the voice of Ulysses confirmed it, and he answered, 'It is I.'
If the gloomy dominions of Pluto had been disclosed before
me, and I had suddenly beheld the shades of Tartarus, which
the gods themselves cannot see without dread, I should not
have been seized with greater horror. I cried out again: 'I call
thee to witness, O earth of Lemnos! O sun! dost thou behold
and suffer this?' Ulysses answered without emotion: 'This is
ordained by Jupiter, and I execute his will.' 'Darest thou,'
said I, 'profane the name of Jove with unhallowed lips? Hast
thou not compelled this youth to practise a fraud, which his
soul abhors?' 'We come,' replied Ulysses, 'neither to deceive
nor to injure you; but to deliver you from solitude and misery

<!-- page 409 -->

to heal your wound, and to give you the glory of subverting
Troy, and restore you in safety to your native country. It is
thyself, and not Ulysses, that is the enemy of Philoctetes.'</p>

"I answered only by reproaches and insult. 'Since thou
hast abandoned me upon this inhospitable coast' said I, 'why
hast thou interrupted such rest as it can give? Go, and secure
to thyself the glory of battle and the delights of peace; enjoy
the sweets of prosperity with the Atrides, and leave pain and
sorrow to me. Why shouldst thou compel me to go with
thee? I am sunk into nothing: I am dead already. Thou
wast once of opinion that I ought to be left here; that my
complaints, and the infection of my wound, would interrupt
the sacrifices of the gods: why is not this thy opinion now?
Thou author of all my misery! may the gods&mdash;&mdash;But the
gods hear me not; they take part with my enemy! O my
country! these eyes shall behold thee no more! O ye gods!
if there is yet one among you so just as to compassionate my
wrongs, avenge them! punish Ulysses, and I shall believe that
I am whole.'</p>

<p>"While I was thus indulging an impotent rage, your father
looked upon me with a calm compassion, which, instead of
resenting the intemperate sallies of a wretch distracted by misfortune,
makes allowance for his infirmity, and bears with his
excess. He stood silent and unmoved, in the stability of his
wisdom, till my passion should be exhausted by its own violence,
as the summit of a rock stands unshaken while it is
beaten by the winds, which at length wearied by their idle
fury are heard no more. He knew that all attempts to reduce
the passions to reason are ineffectual till their violence is past;
when I paused, therefore, and not before, he said: 'Where
are now, O Philoctetes, thy reason and thy courage? This is
the moment in which they can most avail thee. If thou shalt
refuse to follow us, in order to fulfil the great designs which
Jupiter has formed for thee, farewell: thou art not worthy to
achieve the deliverance of Greece or the destruction of Troy.
Live still an exile in Lemnos; these arms which I have secured,
will obtain a glory for Ulysses that was designed for thee.

<!-- page 410 -->

Let us depart, Neoptolemus; argument is lost upon him:
compassion for an individual should not make us give up the
common interest of Greece.'</p>

<p>"This threw me into a new transport of rage, and I was like
a lioness when she is robbed of her young, and makes the
woods echo with her roar. 'O cave,' said I, 'thou shalt not
henceforth be forsaken; I will enter thee as my grave forever.
Receive me, O mansion of sorrow! receive me to famine and
despair! Oh for a sword, that I might die at once! Oh that
the birds of prey would devour me! my arrows shall pierce
them no more. O inestimable bow, consecrated by the hand
of the son of Jove! O Hercules, if thou art still conscious of
what passes upon earth, does not thy breast burn with indignation?
This bow is no longer in the possession of thy friend,
but in the profane and faithless hands of Ulysses. Come
without fear, ye birds of prey, and ye beasts of the desert, to
your ancient dwelling; there are now no fatal arrows in my
hand. Wretch that I am, I can wound you no more: come
then and devour me. Or rather, inexorable Jove! let thy
thunders crush me to nothing.'</p>

<p>"Your father, having tried every other art of persuasion in
vain, thought it best to return me my arms; he therefore made
a sign to Neoptolemus for that purpose, who instantly put the
arrows and the bow into my hand. 'Thou art, indeed,' said I,
'the son of Achilles, and worthy of his blood; but stand aside,
that I may pierce my enemy to the heart.' I then drew an
arrow against your father, but Neoptolemus held my hand.
'Your anger,' said he, 'distracts you; you are not conscious of
the enormity you would commit.'</p>

<p>"But Ulysses stood equally unmoved against danger and
reproach. His patience and intrepidity struck me with reverence
and admiration. I was ashamed of the transport which
hurried me to use for his destruction the arms that he had
restored; my resentment, however, was not yet wholly appeased,
and I was grieved beyond comfort to have received
weapons from a man whom I could not love. But my attention
was now engaged by Neoptolemus. 'Know,' said he,

<!-- page 411 -->

'that the divine Helenus, the son of Priam, came to us from
the city, impelled by the command and inspiration of the gods,
and disclosed to us the secrets of futurity. 'Unhappy Troy,'
said he, 'must fall, but not till he who bears the shafts of Hercules
shall come against her. Under the walls of Troy only
can he be cured: the sons of &AElig;sculapius shall give him
health.' '</p>

<p>"At this moment I felt my heart divided; I was touched
with the ingenuous simplicity of Neoptolemus, and the honesty
with which he had restored my bow; but I could not bear the
thought of submitting to Ulysses, and a false shame held me
some time in suspense. 'Will not the world,' said I, 'despise
me if I become at last the associate of Ulysses and the
Atrides?'</p>

<p>"While I stood thus torpid in suspense, I was suddenly
roused by a voice that was more than human: looking up, I
saw Hercules; he descended in a shining cloud, and was surrounded
with rays of glory. He was easily distinguished by
his strong features, his robust form, and the graceful simplicity
of his gesture; but in his present appearance there was a loftiness
and dignity not equally conspicuous when he was destroying
monsters upon earth.</p>

<p>" 'Thou hearest,' said he, 'and thou beholdest Hercules. I
have descended from Olympus to acquaint thee with the commands
of Jove. Thou knowest by what labors I acquired
immortality: if thou wouldst follow me in the path of glory,
the son of Achilles must be now thy guide. Thy wound shall
be healed; Paris, who has filled the world with calamity, shall
fall by my arrows from thy hand. When Troy shall be taken,
thou shalt send costly spoils to P&oelig;as, thy father, upon Mount
&OElig;ta: he shall place them upon my tomb as a monument of
the victory which my arrows obtained. Thou canst not, O
son of Achilles, conquer without Philoctetes, nor can Philoctetes
conquer without thee. Go, then, like two lions who
chase their prey together. Thou, Philoctetes, shalt be healed
by the skill of &AElig;sculapius at Troy. But, above all things,
keep alive in your hearts the love and reverence of the gods;

<!-- page 412 -->

all other passions and pleasures shall perish with their objects;
these only are immortal and divine.'</p>

<p>"At these words I cried out in a transport of joy: 'The
night is past! the dawn breaks upon me! O cheering light,
after these years of darkness art thou again returned? I feel
thy influence, and I follow thy guiding ray. I quit these
scenes, and stay only to bid them farewell. Farewell, my
grotto! Ye nymphs that haunt these dewy fields, farewell! I
shall hear the sullen sound of these inexorable waves no more.
Farewell, ye cliffs, where I have shivered in the tempest and
been drenched in the rain! Farewell, ye rocks, whose echoes
have so often repeated my complaints! Farewell, ye sweet
fountains, which my sufferings embittered to me! and thou
uncultivated soil, farewell! I leave you; but to my departure
be propitious, since I follow the voice of friendship and the
gods!'</p>

<p>"We then set sail from the coast, and arrived in the Grecian
army before the walls of Troy. Machaon and Podalirius, by
the sacred science of their father, &AElig;sculapius, healed my
wound, at least restored me to the state you see. I am free
from pain, and I have recovered my strength; but I am still
somewhat lame. I brought Paris to the ground like a timid
fawn that is pierced by the arrows of the huntsman, and the
towers of Ilium were soon in ashes. All that followed, you
know already. But the remembrance of my sufferings, notwithstanding
the success and glory that followed, still left
upon my mind an aversion to Ulysses which all his virtues
could not surmount; but, loving irresistibly his resemblance in
a son, my enmity to the father insensibly relents."</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb13">BOOK XIII.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus quarrels with Phalanthus about some prisoners, to which each
of them lays claim: he fights and vanquishes Hippias, who, despising his
youth, had seized the prisoners in question for his brother; but being
afterwards ashamed of his victory, he laments in secret his rashness and
indiscretion, for which he is very desirous to atone. At the same time
Adrastus, king of the Daunians, being informed that the allies were wholly
taken up in reconciling Telemachus and Hippias, marches to attack them
by surprise. After having seized a hundred of their vessels to transport
his own troops to their camp, he first sets it on fire, and then falls
upon Phalanthus' quarters. Phalanthus himself is desperately wounded,
and his brother Hippias slain. Telemachus, having put on his divine
armor, runs to the assistance of Phalanthus; he kills Iphicles, the son
of Adrastus, repulses the victorious enemy, and would have put an end
to the war if a tempest had not intervened. Telemachus orders the
wounded to be carried off, and takes great care of them, particularly of
Phalanthus. He performs the solemnities of the funeral of Hippias himself,
and having collected his ashes in a golden urn, presents them to
his brother.</p>

<p>WHILE Philoctetes proceeded thus with the relation of his
adventures, Telemachus stood suspended and immovable.
His eyes were fixed upon the hero that spoke. All the passions
which had agitated Hercules, Philoctetes, Ulysses, and
Neoptolemus, appeared by turns in his countenance, as they
were successively described in the course of the narration.
Sometimes he interrupted Philoctetes by a sudden and involuntary
exclamation; sometimes he appeared to be absorbed
in thought, like a man who thinks profoundly on the course of
events. When Philoctetes described the confusion of Neoptolemus
in his first attempts at dissimulation, the same confusion
appeared in Telemachus, and he might, in that moment, have
been taken for Neoptolemus himself.</p>

<p>The allied army marched in good order against Adrastus,

<!-- page 414 -->

the tyrant of Daunia, a contemner of the gods and a deceiver
of men. Telemachus found it very difficult to behave without
giving offence among so many princes who were jealous of
each other. It was necessary that he should give cause of
suspicion to none, and that he should conciliate the goodwill
of all. There was great goodness and sincerity in his
disposition, but he was not naturally obliging, and gave himself
little trouble to please others: he was not fond of money,
yet he knew not how to give it away. Thus, with an elevated
mind, and a general disposition to do good, he appeared to be
neither kind nor liberal, to be neither sensible of friendship,
nor grateful for favors, nor attentive to merit. He indulged
his humor without the least regard to the opinions of others.
His mother, Penelope, notwithstanding the care of Mentor,
had encouraged a pride of birth and lofty demeanor, which
cast a shade over all his good qualities. He considered himself
as of a nature superior to the rest of men, whom he
seemed to think the gods had placed upon the earth merely
for his pleasure and service, to anticipate all his desires, and
refer all to him as to a visible divinity. To serve him was, in his
opinion, a happiness that sufficiently recompensed the service.
Nothing that he required was to be supposed impossible; and
at the least delay the impetuous ardor of his temper burst into
a flame.</p>

<p>Those who should have seen him thus unguarded and unrestrained,
would have concluded him incapable of loving any
thing but himself, and sensible only to the gratification of his
own appetites and vanity; but this indifference for others, and
perpetual attention to himself, were merely the effect of the
continual agitation that he suffered from the violence of his
passions. He had been flattered and humored by his mother
from the cradle, and was a striking example of the disadvantages
of high birth. Misfortune had not yet abated either his
haughtiness or impetuosity; in every state of dereliction and
distress, he had still looked round him with disdain; and his
pride, like the palm, still rose under every depression.</p>

<p>While he was with Mentor, his faults did not manifest themselves,

<!-- page 415 -->

and they became less and less every day. Like a fiery
steed, that, in his course, disdains the rock, the precipice, and
the torrent, and is obedient only to one commanding voice and
one guiding hand, Telemachus, impelled by a noble ardor,
could be restrained only by Mentor. But Mentor could arrest
him with a look in the midst of his career: he knew, he felt,
the meaning of his eye the moment that it glanced upon him;
his heart became sensible to virtue, and his countenance softened
into serenity and complaisance; the rebellious tempest is
not more suddenly rebuked into peace, when Neptune lifts his
trident and frowns upon the deep.</p>

<p>When Telemachus was left to himself, all his passions, which
had been restrained like the course of a torrent by a mound,
burst away with yet greater violence. He could not suffer the
arrogance of the Lacedemonians, nor that of Phalanthus their
commander. This colony, which had founded Tarentum, consisted
of young men, who, having been born during the siege of
Troy, had received no education; their illegitimate birth, the
dissoluteness of their mothers, and the licentiousness in which
they had been brought up, gave them an air of savage barbarity.
They resembled rather a band of robbers than a Grecian colony.</p>

<p>Phalanthus took every opportunity to show his contempt of
Telemachus; he frequently interrupted him in their public
councils, and treated his advice as the crude notions of puerile
inexperience; he also frequently made him the subject of his
raillery, as a feeble and effeminate youth: he pointed out his
slightest failings to the chiefs, and was perpetually busy in
fomenting jealousies, and rendering the haughty manner of
Telemachus odious to the allies.</p>

<p>Telemachus having one day taken some Daunians prisoners,
Phalanthus pretended that they belonged to him, because, as
he said, he had defeated the party at the head of his Lacedemonians;
and Telemachus, finding them already vanquished
and put to flight, had nothing to do but to give quarter to
those that threw down their arms, and lead them to the camp.
Telemachus, on the contrary, insisted that he had prevented
Phalanthus from being defeated by that very party, and had

<!-- page 416 -->

turned the scale in his favor. This question was disputed before
an assembly of all the princes of the alliance. Telemachus
being so far provoked as to threaten Phalanthus, they would
immediately have fought if the assembly had not interposed.</p>

<p>Phalanthus had a brother, whose name was Hippias, and
who was much celebrated for his courage, strength, and dexterity.
"Pollux," said the Tarentines, "could not wield the
cestus better, nor could Castor surpass him in the management
of a horse; he had almost the stature and the strength of Hercules."
He was the terror of the whole army, for he was yet
more petulant and brutal than courageous and strong.</p>

<p>Hippias, having remarked the haughtiness with which Telemachus
had menaced his brother, went, in great haste, to
carry off the prisoners to Tarentum, without waiting for the
determination of the assembly. Telemachus, who was privately
informed of it, rushed out after him, burning with rage. He
ran eagerly from one part of the camp to the other, like a boar,
who, being wounded in the chase, turns enraged upon the
hunter. His eye looked round for his enemy, and his hand
shook the spear which he was impatient to hurl against him.
He found him at length, and at the sight of him he was transported
with new fury. He was no longer Telemachus, a noble
youth, whose mind Minerva, under the form of Mentor, had
enriched with wisdom, but an enraged lion, or a lunatic, urged
on by desperate phrensy.</p>

<p>"Stay!" he cried to Hippias; "thou basest of mankind!
stay; and let us see if thou canst wrest from me the spoils of
those whom I have overcome. Thou shalt not carry them to
Tarentum. Thou shalt, this moment, descend to the gloomy
borders of the Styx!" His spear instantly followed his words,
but he threw it with so much fury that he could take no aim,
and it fell to the ground, wide of Hippias. He then drew his
sword, of which the guard was gold, and which had been given
him by Laertes, when he departed from Ithaca, as a pledge of
his affection. Laertes had used it with glory, when he himself
was young, and it had been stained with the blood of many
chiefs of Epirus, during a war in which Laertes had been victorious.

<!-- page 417 -->

The sword was scarcely drawn by Telemachus, when
Hippias, willing to avail himself of his superior strength, rushed
upon him and endeavored to force it from his hand. The
weapon broke in the contest. They then seized each other,
and were in a moment locked together. They appeared like
two savage beasts, striving to tear each other in pieces; fire
sparkled in their eyes; their bodies are now contracted, and
now extended; they now stoop, and now rise; they spring
furiously upon each other, and pant with the thirst of blood.
Thus they engaged, foot to foot, hand to hand; and their
limbs were so entwined with each other that they seemed to
belong to one body. The advantage, at last, inclined to Hippias,
to whom maturity of years had given firmness and a
strength which to the tender age of Telemachus was wanting.
His breath now failed him, and his knees trembled. Hippias
perceiving his weakness and redoubling his efforts, the fate of
Telemachus would have been decided, and he would have
suffered the punishment due to his passion and temerity, if
Minerva, who still watched over him from afar, and suffered
him to fall into this extremity of danger only for his instruction,
had not determined the victory in his favor.</p>

<p>She did not herself quit the palace of Salentum, but she sent
Iris, the swift messenger of the gods, who, spreading her light
wings to the air, divided the unbounded space above, leaving
behind her a long train of light, which painted a cloud of a
thousand dyes.<sup id="t_ref136"><a href="#t_en136">136</a></sup> She descended not to the earth till she came
to the sea-shore, where the innumerable army of the allies was
encamped. She saw the contest at a distance, and marked the
violence and fury of the two combatants; she perceived the
danger of Telemachus, and trembled with apprehension; she
approached in a thin vapor, which she had condensed into a
cloud. At the moment when Hippias, conscious of his superior
strength, believed his victory to be secure, she covered the

<!-- page 418 -->

young charge of Minerva with the shield of the goddess, which
for this purpose had been confided to her care. Telemachus
who was exhausted and fainting, instantly became sensible of
new vigor. In proportion as he revived, the strength and
courage of Hippias declined; he was conscious of something
invisible and divine, which overwhelmed and confounded him.
Telemachus now pressed him closer, and assailed him sometimes
in one posture, and sometimes in another; he staggered
him, and left him not a moment's respite to recover; he at
length threw him down, and fell upon him. An oak of Mount
Ida, which at last yields to a thousand strokes, that have made
the depths of the forest resound, falls<sup id="t_ref137"><a href="#t_en137">137</a></sup> not with a more dreadful
noise than Hippias; the earth groaned beneath him, and
all that was around him shook.</p>

<p>But the &aelig;gis of Minerva infused into Telemachus wisdom as
well as strength. At the moment when Hippias fell under him,
he was touched with a sense of the fault he had committed by
attacking the brother of one of the confederate princes whom
he had taken arms to assist. He recollected the counsels of
Mentor, and they covered him with confusion; he was ashamed
of his victory, and conscious that he ought to have been vanquished.
In the mean time, Phalanthus, transported with
rage, ran to the succor of his brother, and would have pierced
Telemachus with the spear that he carried in his hand, if he
had not feared to pierce Hippias also, whom Telemachus held
under him in the dust. The son of Ulysses might then easily
have taken the life of his enemy, but his anger was appeased,
and he thought only of atoning for his rashness by showing
his moderation. Getting up, therefore, from his antagonist he
said: "I am satisfied, O Hippias, with having taught thee not
to despise my youth; I give thee life, and I admire thy
valor and thy strength. The gods have protected me; yield,
therefore, to the power of the gods.  Henceforth, let us

<!-- page 419 -->

think only of uniting our strength against the common
enemy."</p>

<p>While Telemachus was speaking, Hippias rose from the
ground covered with dust and blood, burning with shame and
indignation. Phalanthus did not dare to take the life of him
who had so generously given life to his brother; he was confused
and scarcely knew what he would do. All the princes
of the alliance ran to the place and carried off Telemachus on
one side, and on the other Phalanthus with Hippias, who, having
lost all his arrogance, kept his eyes fixed upon the ground.
The whole army was struck with astonishment to find that
Telemachus, a youth of so tender an age, who had not yet acquired
the full strength of a man, had been able to prevail
against Hippias, who in strength and stature resembled the
giants, those children of the earth who once attempted to dispossess
the gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>Telemachus, however, was far from enjoying his victory.
While the camp was resounding with his praise he retired to
his tent, overwhelmed with the sense of his fault, and wishing
to escape from himself. He bewailed the impetuosity of his
temper, abhorred himself for the injurious extravagancies
which his passions hurried him to commit, and became conscious
of the vanity, the weakness, and the meanness in his
unbounded pride. He felt that true greatness consists only in
moderation, justice, modesty, and humanity. He saw his defects,
but he did not dare to hope that, after being so often betrayed
into the same faults, he should be ever able to correct
them. He was at war with himself, and in the anguish of the
conflict his complaints were like the roaring of a lion.</p>

<p>Two days he remained alone in his tent, tormented by self-reproach
and ashamed to return back to society. "How can
I," said he, "again dare to look Mentor in the face? Am I
the son of Ulysses, the wisest and most patient of men? Have
I come to fill the camp of the allies with dissension and disorder?
Is it their blood or that of their enemies, the Daunians,
that I ought to spill? I have been rash even to madness,
so that I knew not even how to hurl a spear; I exposed myself

<!-- page 420 -->

to danger and disgrace by engaging Hippias with inferior
strength, and had reason to expect nothing less than death
with the dishonor of being vanquished. And what if I had
thus died? My faults would have perished with me, and the
turbulent pride, the thoughtless presumption of Telemachus,
would no longer have disgraced the name of Ulysses, or the
counsels of Mentor. Oh, that I could but hope never more to
do what now, with unutterable anguish, I repent having done!
I should then, indeed, be happy; but, alas! before the sun that
is now risen shall descend, I shall, with the full consent of my
will, repeat the very same faults that I now regret with shame
and horror. O fatal victory! O mortifying praise! at once
the memorial and reproach of my folly!"</p>

<p>While he was thus alone and inconsolable, he was visited by
Nestor and Philoctetes. Nestor had intended to convince him
of his fault, but the wise old man, instantly perceiving his distress
and contrition, changed his remonstrances into consolation,
and instead of reproving his misconduct, endeavored to soothe
his despair.</p>

<p>This quarrel retarded the confederates in their expedition;
for they could not march against their enemies till they had
reconciled Telemachus to Phalanthus and Hippias. They were
in continual dread lest the Tarentines should fall upon the
company of young Cretans who had followed Telemachus to
the war. Every thing was thrown into confusion, merely by
the folly of Telemachus; and Telemachus, who saw how much
mischief he had caused already, and how much more might
follow from his indiscretion, gave himself up to remorse and
sorrow. The princes were extremely embarrassed; they did
not dare to put the army in motion, lest the Tarentines of
Phalanthus and the Cretans of Telemachus should fall upon
each other in their march. It was with great difficulty that
they were restrained even in the camp, where a strict watch
was kept over them. Nestor and Philoctetes were continually
passing and repassing between the tents of Telemachus and
Phalanthus. Phalanthus was implacable, he had an obdurate
ferocity in his nature, and being perpetually stimulated to revenge

<!-- page 421 -->

by Hippias, whose discourse was full of rage and indignation,
he was neither moved by the eloquence of Nestor nor
the authority of Philoctetes. Telemachus was more gentle,
but he was overwhelmed with grief and refused all consolation.</p>

<p>While the princes were in this perplexity the troops were
struck with consternation: the camp appeared like a house in
which the father of the family, the support of his relations and
the hope of his children, is just dead.</p>

<p>In the midst of this distress and disorder the army was suddenly
alarmed by a confused and dreadful noise, the rattling of
chariots, the clash of arms, the neighing of horses, and the
cries of men,&mdash;some victorious, and urging the slaughter; some
flying and terrified; some wounded and dying. The dust rose
as in a whirlwind, and formed a cloud that obscured the sky
and surrounded the camp. In a few moments with this dust
was mixed a thick smoke, which polluted the air and prevented
respiration. Soon after was heard a hollow noise, like the
roaring of Mount &AElig;tna, when her fires are urged by Vulcan
and the Cyclops, who forge thunder for the father of the gods.
Terror seized all hearts.</p>

<p>Adrastus, vigilant and indefatigable, had surprised the allies
in their camp. He had concealed his own march, and, perfectly
acquainted with theirs, he had, with incredible expedition
and labor, marched around a mountain of very difficult
access, the passes of which had been secured by the allies.
Not dreaming that he could march round it, and knowing that
the defiles by which alone it could be passed were in their
lands, they not only imagined themselves to be in perfect
security, but had formed a design to march through these
defiles, and fall upon their enemy behind the mountain, when
some auxiliaries which they expected should come up. Of
this design, Adrastus, who spared no money to discover the
secrets of an enemy, had gained intelligence; for Nestor and
Philoctetes, notwithstanding their wisdom and experience,
were not sufficiently careful to conceal their undertakings.
Nestor, who was in a declining age, took too much pleasure in
telling what he thought would procure him applause; Philoctetes

<!-- page 422 -->

was naturally less talkative, but he was hasty, and the
slightest provocation would betray him into the discovery of
what he had determined to conceal. Artful people, therefore,
soon found the way to unlock his breast, and get possession of
whatever it contained. Nothing more was necessary than to
make him angry; he would then lose all command of himself,
express his resentment by menaces, and boast that he had certain
means to accomplish his purposes. If this was ever so
slightly doubted, he would immediately disclose his project, and
give up the dearest secret of his heart. Thus did this great
commander resemble a cracked vessel, which, however precious
its material, suffers the liquors that are intrusted to it to drain
away.</p>

<p>Those who had been corrupted by the money of Adrastus
did not fail to take advantage of the weakness of these two
kings. They flattered Nestor with excessive and perpetual
praise; they recounted the victories he had won, expatiated
upon his foresight, and never grew weary of applauding him.
On the other side, they were continually laying snares for the
impatience of Philoctetes; they talked to him of nothing but
difficulties, crosses, dangers, inconveniences, and irremediable
mistakes. The moment his natural impetuosity was moved,
his wisdom forsook him, and he was no longer the same man.</p>

<p>Telemachus, notwithstanding his faults, was much better
qualified to keep a secret; he had acquired a habit of secrecy
by misfortunes, and by the necessity he had been under of concealing,
even in his infancy, his thoughts from the suitors of
Penelope. He had the art of keeping a secret without falsehood,
and even without appearing to have a secret, by that
reserved and mysterious air which generally distinguishes
secretive people. A secret did not appear to lay him under
the least difficulty or restraint; he seemed to be always unconstrained,
easy, and open, as if his heart was upon his lips.
He said all that might be said safely, with the greatest freedom
and unconcern, but he knew, with the utmost precision, where
to stop, and could, without the least appearance of design,
avoid whatever glanced, however obliquely, at what he would

<!-- page 423 -->

conceal. His heart, therefore, was wholly inaccessible, and
his best friends knew only what he thought was necessary to
enable them to give him advice, except Mentor alone, from
whom he concealed nothing. In other friends he placed different
degrees of confidence, in proportion as he experienced
their fidelity and wisdom.</p>

Telemachus had often observed that the resolutions of the
council were too generally known in the camp, and had complained
of it to Nestor and Philoctetes, who did not treat it
with the attention it deserved. Old men are too often inflexible,
for long habit scarcely leaves them the power of choice.
The faults of age are hopeless: as the trunk of an old knotty
tree, if it is crooked, must be crooked forever, so men, after
a certain age, lose their pliancy, and become fixed in habits
which have grown old with them and become, as it were, part
of their constitution. They are sometimes sensible of these
habits, but, at the same time, are also sensible that they cannot
be broken, and sigh over their infirmity in vain; youth is
the only season in which human nature can be corrected, and
in youth the power of correction is without limits.</p>

There was in the allied army a Dolopian whose name was
Eurymachus, an insinuating sycophant, who paid his court to
all the princes, and could accommodate himself to every one's
taste and inclination. He kept his invention and diligence continually
upon the stretch to render himself agreeable. If Eurymachus
might be believed, nothing was difficult. If his advice
was asked, he guessed immediately what answer would be most
pleasing, and gave it. He had humor, and indulged in raillery
against those from whom he had nothing to fear; but to others
he was respectful and complaisant; and he had the art of rendering
flattery so delicate that the most modest received it without
disgust. He was grave with the sober, and with the jovial
he was gay; he could assume all characters, however different,
with equal facility. Men of sincerity appear always the
same, and their conduct, being regulated by the unalterable
laws of virtue, is steady and uniform; they are, therefore,
much less agreeable to princes than those who suit themselves

<!-- page 424 -->

to their predominant passions. Eurymachus had considerable
military skill, and was very able in business. He was a soldier
of fortune, who, having attached himself to Nestor, had entirely
gained his confidence, and could, by flattering that vanity and
fondness for praise which a little sullied the lustre of his character,
draw from him whatever he wanted to know.</p>

Philoctetes, though he never trusted him, was not less in
his power; for in him, irascibility and impatience produced
the same effect that an ill-placed confidence produced in Nestor.
Eurymachus had nothing to do but to contradict him;
for when once he was provoked, all his secrets were discovered.
This man had been bribed with large sums of money to betray
the councils of the allies to Adrastus, who had, in his
army, a certain number of chosen men, who went over to the
allies as deserters, and came back, one by one, with intelligence
from Eurymachus, as often as he had any thing of importance
to communicate. This treachery was practised without much
danger of detection, for these messengers carried no letters,
and therefore if they happened to be seized, nothing was
found upon them that could render Eurymachus suspected.</p>

<p>Every project of the allies, therefore, was constantly defeated
by Adrastus. An enterprise was scarcely resolved upon
in council, before the Daunians made the very dispositions
which alone could prevent its success. Telemachus was indefatigable
to discover the cause, and endeavored to put Nestor
and Philoctetes upon their guard, by alarming their suspicion;
but his care was ineffectual: they were blind.</p>

<p>It had been resolved in council to wait for a considerable
reinforcement that was expected, and a hundred vessels were
dispatched secretly by night to convey these troops from that
part of the coast, whither they had been ordered to repair, to
the place where the army was encamped, with greater speed
and facility; the ground over which they would otherwise
have been obliged to march, being in some places very difficult
to pass. In the mean time they thought themselves in perfect
security, having taken possession of the passes of the
neighboring mountain, which was a part of the Apennines

<!-- page 425 -->

most difficult of access. The camp was upon the banks of the
river Galesus, not far from the sea, in a delightful country,
abounding with pasturage, and with whatever else was necessary
for the subsistence of an army. Adrastus was on the
other side of the mountain, which it was thought impossible
for him to pass; but as he knew that the allies were then
weak, that a large reinforcement was expected to join them,
that vessels were waiting to receive them on board, and that
dissension and animosity had been produced in the army by
the quarrel between Telemachus and Phalanthus, he undertook
to march round without delay. He proceeded with the utmost
expedition, advancing night and day along the borders of
the sea, through ways which had always been thought inaccessible.
Thus courage and labor<sup id="t_ref138"><a href="#t_en138">138</a></sup> surmount all obstacles; thus,
to those who can dare and suffer, nothing is impossible; and
those who, slumbering in idleness and timidity, dream that
every thing is impossible that appears to be difficult, deserve
to be surprised and subdued.</p>

<p>Adrastus fell unexpectedly upon the hundred vessels of the
allies at break of day. As these vessels were not prepared for
defence, and those on board had not the least suspicion of an
attack, they were seized without resistance, and served to
transport his troops with the greatest expedition to the mouth
of the Galesus. He then proceeded, without delay, up the
river. The advanced guard of the allies on that side, believing
that these vessels brought the reinforcement they expected,
received them with shouts of joy. Adrastus and his men got
on shore before they discovered their mistake. He fell upon
them when they had no suspicion of danger, and he found the
camp open, without order, without chief, and without arms.</p>

<p>The quarter of the camp which he first attacked was that
of the Tarentines, commanded by Phalanthus. The Daunians
entered so suddenly and with so much vigor, that the surprise
of the Lacedemonians rendered them incapable of resistance.
While they were seeking their arms with a confusion that

<!-- page 426 -->

made them embarrass and impede each other, Adrastus set
fire to the camp. The flames immediately rose from the tents
to the sky, and the noise of the fire was like that of a torrent
which rolls over a whole country, bearing down trees of the
deepest root, and sweeping away the treasured harvest with
the barn, and flocks and herds with the fold and the stall.<sup id="t_ref139"><a href="#t_en139">139</a></sup> The
flames were driven by the wind from tent to tent, and the
whole camp had soon the appearance of an ancient forest,
which some accidental spark had set on fire.</p>

<p>Phalanthus, though he was nearest to the danger, could apply
no remedy. He saw that all his troops must perish in the
conflagration if they did not immediately abandon the camp;
yet he was sensible that a sudden retreat before a victorious
enemy might produce a final and fatal disorder. He began,
however, to draw up his Lacedemonian youth before they
were half armed. But Adrastus gave him no time to breathe;
a band of expert archers killed many of them on one side,
and a company of slingers threw stones as thick as hail on the
other. Adrastus himself, sword in hand, at the head of a
chosen number of Daunians, pursued the fugitives by the light
of the flames, and put all that escaped the fire to the sword.
Blood flowed round him in a deluge; his fury exceeded that
of lions and tigers, when they tear in pieces the shepherd and
the flock. The troops of Phalanthus stood torpid in despair.
Death appeared before them like a spectre led by an infernal
Fury, and their blood froze in their veins; their limbs would
no longer obey their will, and their trembling knees deprived
them even of the hope of flight.</p>

<p>Phalanthus, whose faculties were in some degree roused by
shame and despair, lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven;
he saw his brother Hippias fall at his feet under the dreadful
hand of Adrastus. He was stretched upon the earth and
rolled in the dust; the blood gushed from a deep wound in

<!-- page 427 -->

his side like a river; his eyes closed against the light, and his
soul, furious and indignant, issued with the torrent of his
blood. Phalanthus himself, all covered with the blood of his
brother, and unable to afford him succor, was instantly surrounded
by a crowd of enemies, who pressed him with all
their power. His shield was pierced by a thousand arrows;
he was wounded in many parts of the body; the troops fled
without a possibility of being brought back to the charge; the
gods looked down upon his sufferings without pity.</p>

<p>Jupiter, surrounded by all the celestial deities, surveyed the
slaughter of the allies from the summit of Olympus. At the
same time he consulted the immutable destinies, and beheld the
chiefs whose thread of life was that day to be divided by the
Fates. Every eye in the divine assembly was fixed upon the
countenance of Jupiter, to discover his will. But the father
of gods and men thus addressed them, with a voice in which
majesty was tempered with sweetness: "You see the distress
of the allies, and the triumph of Adrastus; but the scene is
deceptive. The prosperity and honor of the wicked are short.
The victory of Adrastus, the impious and perfidious, shall not
be complete. The allies are punished by this misfortune, only
that they may correct their faults, and learn better to conceal
their counsels. Minerva is preparing new laurels for Telemachus,
whom she delights to honor." Jupiter ceased to speak,
and the gods continued, in silence, to behold the battle.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Nestor and Philoctetes were informed
that one part of the camp was already burned; that the wind
was spreading the flames to the rest; that the troops were in
disorder, and that Phalanthus, with his Lacedemonians, had
given way. At this dreadful intelligence they ran to arms,
assembled the leaders, and gave orders for the camp to be
immediately abandoned, that the men might not perish in the
conflagration.</p>

<p>Telemachus, who had been pining with inconsolable dejection,
forgot his anguish in a moment, and resumed his arms.
His arms were the gift of Minerva, who, under the figure of
Mentor, pretended to have received them from an excellent

<!-- page 428 -->

artificer of Salentum; but they were, indeed, the work of
Vulcan, who, at her request, had forged them in the smoking
caverns of Mount &AElig;tna.</p>

<p>Those arms<sup id="t_ref140"><a href="#t_en140">140</a></sup> had a polish like glass, and were effulgent as
the rays of the sun. On the cuirass was the representation of
Neptune and Pallas, disputing which of them should give name
to a rising city. Neptune struck the earth with his trident,
and a horse sprung out at the blow: his eyes had the appearance
of living fire, and the foam of his mouth sparkled like
light; his mane floated in the wind; his limbs, at once nervous
and supple, played under him with equal agility and vigor; his
motion could not be reduced to any pace, but he seemed to
bound along with a swiftness and elasticity that left no trace
of his foot, and the spectator could scarcely believe but that he
heard him neigh.</p>

<p>In another compartment, Minerva appeared to be giving the
branch of an olive, a tree of her own planting, to the inhabitants
of her new city: the branch, with its fruit, represented
that plenty and peace which wisdom cannot fail to prefer before
the disorders of war, of which the horse was an emblem.
This simple and useful gift decided the contest in favor of the
goddess, and Athens, the pride of Greece, was distinguished by
her name.<sup id="t_ref141"><a href="#t_en141">141</a></sup></p>

<p>Minerva was also represented as assembling around her the
Liberal Arts, under the symbols of little children with wings:
they appeared to fly to her for protection, terrified at the
brutal fury of Mars, who marks his way with desolation, as
lambs gather round their dam at the sight of a hungry wolf,
who has already opened his mouth to devour them. The goddess,
with a look of disdain and anger, confounded, by the
excellence of her works, the presumptuous folly of Arachne,
who vied with her in the labors of the loom. Arachne herself
was also to be seen in the piece, her limbs attenuated

<!-- page 429 -->

and disfigured, and her whole form changed into that of a
spider.</p>

<p>At a little distance, Minerva was again represented as giving
counsel to Jupiter when the Giants made war upon heaven,
and encouraging the inferior deities in their terror and consternation.
She was also represented with her spear and &aelig;gis,
upon the borders of Simois and Scamander, leading Ulysses
by the hand, animating the flying Greeks with new courage,
and sustaining them against the heroes of Troy and the prowess
even of Hector himself. She was last represented as introducing
Ulysses into the fatal machine, by which, in one night,
the whole empire of Priam was subverted.</p>

<p>Another part of the shield represented Ceres in the fruitful
plains of Enna, the centre of Sicily. The goddess appeared to
be collecting together a scattered multitude, who were seeking
subsistence by the chase, or gathering up the wild fruit that
fell from the trees. To these ignorant barbarians she seemed
to teach the art of meliorating the earth, and deriving sustenance
from its fertility. She presented them a plough, and
showed them how oxen were to be yoked. The earth was
then seen to part in furrows under the share, and a golden
harvest waved upon the plain: the reaper put in his sickle, and
was rewarded for all his labor. Iron, which in other places
was devoted to works of destruction, was here employed only
to produce plenty and provide for delight.</p>

<p>The nymphs of the meadows, crowned with flowers, were
dancing on the borders of a river near a grove; Pan gave the
music of his pipe, and the fauns and satyrs were seen frolicking
together on the border. Bacchus was also represented, crowned
with ivy, leaning with one hand on his thyrsus, and holding
the branch of a vine, laden with grapes, in the other. The
beauty of the god was effeminate, but mingled with something
noble, impassioned, and languishing, that cannot be expressed.
He appeared upon the shield as he did to the unfortunate
Ariadne, when he found her alone, forsaken, and overwhelmed
with grief, a stranger upon an unknown shore.</p>

<p>Finally, numbers of people were seen on all sides&mdash;old men

<!-- page 430 -->

carrying the first fruits of their labor as an offering to the gods&mdash;young
men returning, weary with the labor of the day, to their
wives, who had gone out to meet them, leading their children
by the hand and interrupting their walk with caresses. There
were also shepherds, some of whom appeared to be singing,
while others danced to the music of the reed. The whole was
a representation of peace, plenty, and delight; every thing was
smiling and happy. Wolves even were seen sporting with the
sheep in the pastures; the lion and tiger, having lost their
ferocity, grazed peaceably with the lamb,&mdash;a shepherd that was
still a child led them, obedient to his crook, in one flock: and
this peaceful picture recalled all the charms of the golden age.</p>

<p>Telemachus, having put on this divine armor, took, instead
of his own shield, the dreadful &aelig;gis of Minerva, which had
been sent him by Iris, the speedy messenger of the gods. Iris
had, unperceived, taken away his shield, and had left, in its
stead, this &aelig;gis, at the sight of which the gods themselves are
impressed with dread.</p>

<p>When he was thus armed, he ran out of the camp to avoid
the flames, and called to him all the chiefs of the army; he
called with a voice that restored the courage they had lost,
and his eyes sparkled with a brightness that was more than
human. His aspect was placid, and his manner easy and composed;
he gave orders with the same quiet attention as that of
an old man, who regulates his family and instructs his children;
but in action he was sudden and impetuous; he resembled a
torrent, which not only rolls on its own waves with irresistible
rapidity, but carries with it the heaviest vessel that floats upon
its surface.</p>

<p>Philoctetes and Nestor, the chiefs of the Mandurians, and
the leaders of other nations, felt themselves influenced by an
irresistible authority: age appeared to be no longer conscious
of experience; every commander seemed to give up implicitly
all pretensions to counsel and wisdom; even jealousy, a passion
so natural to man, was suspended; every tongue was
silent, and every eye was fixed with admiration upon Telemachus;
all stood ready to obey him without reflection, as if

<!-- page 431 -->

they had always been under his command. He advanced to
an eminence, from which the disposition of the enemy might
be discovered: at the first glance he saw that not a moment
was to be lost, that the burning of the camp had thrown the
Daunians into disorder, and that they might now be surprised
in their turn. He therefore took a circuit with the utmost
expedition, followed by the most experienced commanders.</p>

<p>He fell upon the Daunians in the rear, when they believed
the whole army of the allies to be surrounded by the conflagration.
This unexpected attack threw them into confusion; and
they fell under the hand of Telemachus, as leaves<sup id="t_ref142"><a href="#t_en142">142</a></sup> fall from
the trees in the declining year, when the northern tempest,
the harbinger of winter, makes the veterans of the forest groan,
and bends the branches to the trunk. Telemachus strewed
the earth with the victims of his prowess. His spear pierced
the heart of Iphicles, the youngest son of Adrastus: Iphicles
rashly presented himself before him in battle, to preserve the
life of his father, whom Telemachus was about to attack by
surprise. Telemachus and Iphicles were equal in beauty,
vigor, dexterity, and courage; they were of the same stature,
had the same sweetness of disposition, and were both tenderly
beloved by their parents; but Iphicles fell like a flower of the
field, which, in the full pride of its beauty, is cut down by the
scythe of the mower. Telemachus then overthrew Euphorion,
the most celebrated of all the Lydians that came from Etruria.
His sword at last pierced the breast of Cleomenes, who had
just plighted his faith in marriage, and had promised rich
spoils to the wife whom he was destined to see no more.</p>

<p>Adrastus beheld the fall of his son and of his captains, and
saw his victory wrested from him, when he thought it secure,
in a transport of rage. Phalanthus, almost prostrate at his
feet, was like a victim, wounded but not slain, that starts
from the sacred knife, and flies terrified from the altar.<sup id="t_ref143"><a href="#t_en143">143</a></sup>  In

<!-- page 432 -->

one moment more, his life would have been the prize of
Adrastus.</p>

<p>But in this crisis of his fate, he heard the shout of Telemachus,
rushing to his assistance, and looked upward. His life
was now given him back, and the cloud which was settling
over his eyes vanished. The Daunians, alarmed at this unexpected
attack, abandoned Phalanthus, to repress a more formidable
enemy. Adrastus was stung with new rage, like a tiger,
from which the shepherds, with united force, snatch the prey
that he was ready to devour. Telemachus sought him in the
throng, desiring to finish the war at a stroke, by delivering the
allies from their implacable enemy.</p>

<p>But Jupiter would not vouchsafe the son of Ulysses so sudden
and easy a victory; even Minerva, that he might better
learn to govern, was willing that he should continue longer to
suffer. The impious Adrastus, therefore, was preserved by the
father of the gods, that Telemachus might acquire new virtue,
and be distinguished by greater glory. A thick cloud was
interposed by Jupiter, between the Daunians and their enemies;
the will of the gods was declared in thunders that shook
the plain, and threatened to crush the weak inhabitants of the
earth under the ruins of Olympus; the lightning divided the
firmament from pole to pole; and the light which, this moment,
dazzled the eye, left it the next in total darkness. An
impetuous shower that immediately followed, contributed to
separate the two armies.</p>

<p>Adrastus availed himself of the succor of the gods, without
any secret acknowledgment of their power,&mdash;an instance of
ingratitude, which made him worthy of more signal vengeance.
He possessed himself of a situation, between the ruins of the
camp and a morass which extended to the river, with such
promptness and expedition as made even his retreat an honor,
and at once showed his readiness at expedients, and his perfect
possession of himself. The allies, animated by Telemachus,
would have pursued him; but he escaped, by favor of the
storm, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</p>

<p>The allies had now nothing to do but to return to the camp

<!-- page 433 -->

and repair the damage it had suffered. But the scene, as they
entered it, exhibited the miseries of war in their utmost horror.
The sick and wounded, not having strength to quit their tents,
had become a prey to the flames; and many that appeared to
be half burnt, were still able to express their misery in a plaintive
and dying voice, calling upon the gods, and looking upward.
At these sights and these sounds, Telemachus was
pierced to the heart, and burst into tears; he was seized with
horror and compassion, and involuntarily turned away his eyes
from objects which he trembled to behold,&mdash;from wretches
whose death was inevitable, but painful and slow,&mdash;from those
bodies, in part devoured by the fire, which had the appearance
of the flesh of victims that is burnt upon the altar, and mixes
the savor of sacrifices with the air.</p>

<p>"Alas!" exclaimed Telemachus, "how various and how
dreadful are the miseries of war! What horrid infatuation
impels mankind! Their days upon the earth are few, and those
few are evil; why then should they precipitate death which is
already near? why should they add bitterness to life that is
already bitter? All men are brothers, and yet they hunt each
other as prey. The wild beasts of the desert are less cruel.
Lions wage not war against lions, and to the tiger, the tiger
is peaceable; the only objects of their ferocity are animals of
a different species; man does, in opposition to his reason, what
by animals that are without reason is never done. And for
what are these wars undertaken? Is there not land enough
in the world for every man to appropriate more than he can
cultivate? Are there not deserts which the whole race could
never people? What then is the motive to war? Some
tyrant sighs for a new appellation&mdash;he would be called a conqueror;
and for this he kindles a flame that desolates the
earth. Thus a wretched individual who would not have been
born but for the anger of the gods, brutally sacrifices his species
to his vanity: ruin must spread, blood must flow, fire
must consume, and he who escapes from the flames and the
sword, must perish by famine with yet more anguish and
horror, that one man, to whom the misery of a world is sport

<!-- page 434 -->

may, from this general destruction, obtain a fanciful possession
of what he calls glory! How vile the perversion of so sacred
a name! how worthy, above all others, of indignation and contempt,
those who have so far forgotten humanity! Let those
who fancy they are demi-gods, henceforth remember that they
are less than men, and let every succeeding age by which
they have hoped to be admired hold them in execration.
With what caution should princes undertake a war! Wars,
indeed, ought always to be just; but that is not sufficient;
they ought also to be necessary to the general good. The
blood of a nation ought never to be shed except for its own
preservation in the utmost extremity. But the perfidious
counsels of flattery, false notions of glory, groundless jealousies,
insatiable ambition, disguised under specious appearances,
and connections insensibly formed, seldom fail to engage princes
in wars which render them unhappy, in which every thing
is put in hazard without necessity, and which produce as much
mischief to their subjects as to their enemies." Such were the
reflections of Telemachus.</p>

<p>But he did not content himself with deploring the evils of
war; he endeavored to mitigate them. He went himself from
tent to tent, affording to the sick and dying such assistance
and comfort as they could receive; he distributed among them
not only medicine, but money; he soothed and consoled them
by expressions of tenderness and friendship, and sent others
on the same errand to those whom he could not visit himself.</p>

<p>Among the Cretans that had accompanied him from Salentum,
were two old men, whose names were Traumaphilus and
Nosophugus.</p>

<p>Traumaphilus had been at the siege of Troy with Idomeneus,
and had learned the art of healing wounds from the sons of
&AElig;sculapius. He poured into the deepest and most malignant
sores an odoriferous liquor, which removed the dead and mortified
flesh without the assistance of the knife, and facilitated
the formation of new flesh of fairer and healthier texture
than the first.</p>

<p>Nosophugus had never seen the sons of &AElig;sculapius, but, by

<!-- page 435 -->

the assistance of Merion, had procured a sacred and mysterious
book, which was written by &AElig;sculapius for their instruction.
Nosophugus was also beloved by the gods; he had
composed hymns in honor of the offspring of Latona; and he
offered every day a lamb, white and spotless, to Apollo, by
whom he was frequently inspired. As soon as he saw the
sick, he knew by the appearance of the eyes, the color of the
skin, the temperature of the body, and the state of respiration,
what was the cause of the disease. Sometimes he administered
medicines that operated by perspiration; and the
success showed how much the increase or diminution of that
secretion can influence the mechanism of the body for its hurt
or advantage. To those that were languishing under a gradual
decay, he gave infusions of certain salutary herbs, that by degrees
fortified the noble parts, and, by purifying the blood,
brought back the vigor and the freshness of youth. But he
frequently declared that if it were not for criminal excesses
and idle fears, there would be but little employment for the
physician. "The number of diseases," said he, "is a disgrace
to mankind; for virtue produces health. Intemperance converts
the very food that should sustain life into a poison that
destroys it; and pleasure, indulged to excess, shortens our days
more than they can be lengthened by medicine. The poor
are more rarely sick for want of nourishment than the rich by
taking too much. High-seasoned meats, that stimulate appetite
after nature is sufficed, are rather poison than food.
Medicines themselves offer violence to nature, and should never
be used but in the most pressing necessity. The great remedy
which is always innocent and always useful, is temperance, a
moderate use of pleasure, tranquillity of mind, and exercise of
the body. These produce a pure and well-tempered blood,
and throw off superfluous humors that would corrupt it."
Thus was Nosophugus yet less honored for the medicine by
which he cured diseases, than for the rules he prescribed to
prevent them and render medicine unnecessary.</p>

<p>These excellent persons were sent by Telemachus to visit the
sick of the army.  Many they restored by their remedies, but

<!-- page 436 -->

yet more by the care which they took to have them properly attended,
to have their persons kept clean, and the air about them
pure; at the same time confining the convalescent to an exact
regimen, as well with respect to the quality as the quantity of
their food. The soldiers, touched with gratitude at this
seasonable and important relief, gave thanks to the gods for
having sent Telemachus among them.</p>

<p>"He is not," said they, "a mere mortal like ourselves; he
is certainly some beneficent deity in a human shape; or if he
is indeed a mortal, he bears less resemblance to the rest of men
than to the gods. He is an inhabitant of the earth only to
diffuse good; his affability and benevolence recommend him
still more than his valor. Oh that we might have him for our
king! but the gods reserve him for some more favored and
happy people among whom they design to restore the golden
age!"</p>

<p>These encomiums were overheard by Telemachus, while he
was going about the camp in the night to guard against the
stratagems of Adrastus, and therefore could not be suspected
of flattery, like those which designing sycophants often bestow
upon princes to their face, insolently presuming that they
have neither modesty nor delicacy, and that nothing more is
necessary to secure their favor than to load them with extravagant
praise. To Telemachus, that only was pleasing
which was true; he could bear no praise but that, which, being
given when he was absent, he might reasonably conclude to
be just. To such praise he was not insensible, but tasted the
pure and serene delight which the gods have decreed to virtue
alone, and which vice can neither enjoy nor conceive. He did
not, however, give himself up to this pleasure: his faults immediately
rushed into his mind; he remembered his excessive
regard for himself and indifference to others; he felt a secret
shame at having received from nature a disposition which
made him appear to want the feelings of humanity. He referred
to Minerva all the praise that he had received, as having
grafted excellence upon him, which he thought he had no right
to appropriate to himself.</p>

<!-- page 437 -->

<p>"It is thy bounty," said he, "O goddess, which has given
me Mentor to fill my mind with knowledge, and correct the
infirmities of my nature. Thou hast vouchsafed me wisdom
to profit by my faults and mistrust myself. It is thy power
that restrains the impetuosity of my passions; and the pleasure
that I feel in comforting the afflicted is thy gift. Men would
hate me but for thee, and without thee I should deserve hatred;
but for thee I should be guilty of irreparable faults,&mdash;I should
resemble an infant, who, not conscious of its own weakness,
quits the side of its mother and falls at the next step."</p>

<p>Nestor and Philoctetes were astonished to see Telemachus
so affable, so attentive to oblige, so ready to supply the wants
of others, and so diligent to prevent them. They were struck
with the difference of his behavior, but could not conceive the
cause. What surprised them most was the care that he took
about the funeral of Hippias. He went himself and drew the
body, bloody and disfigured, from the spot where it lay hidden
under a heap of the slain; he was touched with a pious sorrow,
and wept over it. "O mighty shade," said he, "thou art
now ignorant of my reverence for thy valor! Thy haughtiness,
indeed, provoked me; but thy fault was from the ardor
of youth. Alas! I know but too well, how much youth has
need of pardon. We were in the way to be united by friendship;
I was in the wrong myself. Oh, why have the gods
snatched thee from me before I had an opportunity to compel
thy esteem!"<sup id="t_ref144"><a href="#t_en144">144</a></sup></p>

<p>Telemachus caused the body to be washed with odoriferous
liquors, and by his orders a funeral pile was prepared. The
lofty pines groaned under the strokes of the axe, and, as they
fell, rolled down the declivity of the mountain. Oaks, those
ancient children of the earth, which seemed to threaten heaven,
and elms and poplars adorned with thick foliage of vivid green,
with the spreading beech, the glory of the forest, fell<sup id="t_ref145"><a href="#t_en145">145</a></sup> upon the

<!-- page 438 -->

borders of the river Galesus; and a pile was there raised with
such order that it resembled a regular building: the flame
began to sparkle among the wood, and a cloud of smoke
ascended in volumes to the sky.</p>

<p>The Lacedemonians advanced with a slow and mournful
pace, holding their lances reversed, and fixing their eyes upon
the ground; the ferocity of their countenances was softened
into grief, and tears flowed from their eyes. These Lacedemonians
were followed by Pherecydes, an old man, yet less depressed
by the weight of years than by sorrow to have survived
Hippias, whom he had educated from his earliest youth. He
raised his hands, and his eyes that were drowned in tears, to
heaven. Since the death of Hippias he had refused to eat,
and the gentle hand of sleep had not once closed his eyes, not
suspended the anguish of his mind. He walked on with
trembling steps, implicitly following the crowd, and scarcely
knowing whither he went. His heart was too full for speech;
his silence was that of dejection and despair. But when he
saw the pile kindled, a sudden transport seized him, and he
cried out: "O Hippias, Hippias! I shall see thee no more!
Hippias is dead, and I am still living! O my dear Hippias!
it was I that taught thee, cruel and unrelenting&mdash;it was I
that taught thee the contempt of death. I hoped that my
dying eyes would have been closed by thy hand, and that I
should have breathed the last sigh into thy bosom. Ye have
prolonged my life, ye gods, in your displeasure, that I might
see the life of Hippias at an end! O my child, thou dear
object of my care and hope, I shall see thee no more! But I
shall see thy mother, who, dying of grief, will reproach me
with thy death; and I shall see thy wife, fading in the bloom
of youth, and agonized with despair and sorrow, of which I am
the cause! Oh call me from these scenes to the borders of the
Styx, which have received thy shade! The light is hateful to
my eyes, and there is none but thee whom I desire to behold!

<!-- page 439 -->

I live, O my dear Hippias, only to pay the last duty to thy
ashes!"</p>

<p>The body of the hero appeared stretched upon a bier that
was decorated with purple and gold. His eyes were extinguished
in death, but his beauty was not totally effaced, nor
had the graces faded wholly from his countenance, however
pale. Around his neck, that was whiter than snow, but
reclined upon the shoulder, floated his long black hair, still
more beautiful than that of Atys or Ganymede, but in a few
moments to be reduced to ashes; and on his side appeared
the wound through which, issuing with the torrent of his
blood, his spirit had been dismissed to the gloomy regions of
the dead.</p>

<p>Telemachus followed the body, sorrowful and dejected, and
scattered flowers upon it. When it was laid upon the pile, he
could not see the flames catch the clothes that were wrapped
about it without again bursting into tears. "Farewell," said
he, "O magnanimous youth, for I must not presume to call
thee friend. Let thy shade be appeased, since thy glory is
full, and my envy is precluded only by my love. Thou art
delivered from the miseries that we continue to suffer, and hast
entered a better region by the most glorious path. How
happy should I be to follow thee by the same way! May the
Styx yield a passage to thy shade, and the fields of Elysium
lie open before thee! may thy name be preserved with honor
to the latest generation, and thy ashes rest forever in peace!"</p>

<p>As soon as Telemachus, who had uttered these words in a
broken and interrupted voice, was silent, the whole army sent
up a general cry: the fate of Hippias, whose exploits they recounted,
melted them into tenderness, and grief at once revived
his good qualities, and buried in oblivion all the failings which
the impetuosity of youth and a bad education had concurred
to produce. They were, however, yet more touched by the
tender sentiments of Telemachus. "Is this," said they, "the
young Greek that was so proud, so contemptuous, and intractable?
He is now affable, humane, and tender. Minerva, who
has distinguished his father by her favor, is also certainly propitious

<!-- page 440 -->

to him. She has undoubtedly bestowed upon him the
most valuable gift which the gods themselves can bestow upon
man&mdash;a heart that is at once replete with wisdom and sensible
to friendship."</p>

<p>The body was now consumed by the flames. Telemachus
himself sprinkled the still smoking ashes with water, which
gums and spices had perfumed;<sup id="t_ref146"><a href="#t_en146">146</a></sup> he then deposited them in a
golden urn, which he crowned with flowers, and he carried the
urn to Phalanthus. Phalanthus was stretched out upon a
couch, his body being pierced with many wounds, and life was
so far exhausted that he saw, not far distant, the irremediable
gates of death.</p>

<p>Traumaphilus and Nosophugus, whom Telemachus sent to
his assistance, had exerted all their art; they had brought
back his fleeting spirit by degrees, and he was insensibly animated
with new strength; a gentle but penetrating power, a
new principle of life gliding from vein to vein, reached even to
the heart; and a genial warmth relaxing the frozen hand of
Death, the tyrant remitted his grasp. But the insensibility of
a dying languor was immediately succeeded by an agony of
grief, and he felt the loss of his brother, which before he was
not in a condition to feel. "Alas!" said he, "why all this
assiduity to preserve my life? It would be better that I should
follow Hippias to the grave&mdash;my dear Hippias!&mdash;whom I saw
perish at my side. O my brother, thou art lost forever, and
with thee all the comforts of life! I shall see thee, I shall hear
thee, I shall embrace thee no more! I shall no more unburden
my breast of its troubles to thee, and my friendship shall participate
of thy sorrows no more! And is Hippias thus lost forever?
O ye gods, that delight in the calamities of men, can it
be?&mdash;or is it not a dream, from which I shall awake? Ah, no!
it is a dreadful reality! I have indeed lost thee, O Hippias!
I saw thee expire in the dust, and I must at least live till
I have avenged thee&mdash;till I have offered up, to thy manes,

<!-- page 441 -->

the merciless Adrastus, whose hands are stained with thy
blood."</p>

<p>While Phalanthus was uttering these passionate exclamations,
and the divine dispensers of health were endeavoring to
soothe him into peace, lest the perturbation of his mind should
increase his malady and render their medicines ineffectual, he
suddenly beheld Telemachus, who had approached him unperceived.
At the first sight of him, he felt the conflict of two
opposite passions in his bosom: his mind still glowed with resentment
at the remembrance of what passed between Telemachus
and Hippias, and the grief that he felt for the loss of his
brother gave this resentment new force; but he was also conscious
that he was himself indebted for his life to Telemachus,
who had rescued him, bleeding and exhausted, from the hands
of Adrastus. During this struggle, he remarked the golden
urn that contained the dear remains of his brother, and the
sight instantly melted him into tears. He embraced Telemachus
at first without power to speak, but at length he said, in
a feeble and interrupted voice:</p>

<p>"Thy virtue, O son of Ulysses, has compelled my love. I
am indebted to thee for my life; I am indebted to thee, also,
for something yet more precious than life itself. The body of
my brother would have been a prey to the vulture but for
thee, and but for thee the rites of sepulture had been denied
him. His shade would have wandered, forlorn and wretched,
upon the borders of the Styx, forever repulsed by Charon with
inexorable severity.<sup id="t_ref147"><a href="#t_en147">147</a></sup> Must I lie under such obligations to a
man whom I have so bitterly hated? May the gods reward
thee, and dismiss me from life and misery together! Render
to me, O Telemachus, the last duties that you have rendered
to my brother, and your glory shall be complete."</p>

<p>Phalanthus then fell back, fainting and overwhelmed with
grief. Telemachus continued near him, but, not daring to
speak, waited in silence till his strength should return.  He

<!-- page 442 -->

revived after a short time, and, taking the urn out of the hands
of Telemachus, he kissed it many times and wept over it. "O
precious dust," said he, "when shall mine be mingled with you
in the same urn? O my brother, I will follow thee to the
regions of the dead! There is no need that I should avenge
thee, for Telemachus will avenge us both."</p>

<p>By the skill of the two sages, who practised the science of
&AElig;sculapius, Phalanthus gradually recovered. Telemachus was
continually with them at the couch of the sick, that they might
exert themselves with more diligence to hasten the cure; and
the whole army was more struck with admiration at the tenderness
with which he succored his most inveterate enemy,
than at the wisdom and valor with which he had preserved
the army of the allies.</p>

<p>He was, however, at the same time indefatigable in the ruder
labors of war. He slept but little, and his sleep was often interrupted,
sometimes by the intelligence which was brought
him at every hour of the night, as well as of the day, and
sometimes by examining every quarter of the camp, which he
never visited twice together at the same time, that he might
be more sure to surprise those that were negligent of their
duty. He often returned to his tent covered with sweat and
dust. Though his sleep was short and his labor great, yet
his diet was plain. He fared in every respect like the common
soldiers, that he might give them an example of patience and
sobriety. Provisions becoming scarce in the camp, he thought
it necessary to prevent murmurings and discontent by suffering
voluntarily the same inconveniences which they suffered
by necessity. But this labor and temperance, however severe,
were so far from impairing his vigor, that he became every
day more hardy and robust. He began to lose the softer graces
which may be considered as the flower of youth; his complexion
became browner and less delicate, and his limbs more
muscular and firm.</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb14">BOOK XIV.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus being persuaded, by several dreams, that his father Ulysses
was no longer alive, executes his design of seeking him among the dead.
He retires from the camp, and is followed by two Cretans as far as a
temple near the celebrated cavern of Acherontia. He enters it, and
descends through the gloom to the borders of the Styx, where Charon
takes him into his boat. He presents himself before Pluto, who, in
obedience to superior powers, permits him to seek his father. He passes
through Tartarus, and is witness to the torments that are inflicted upon
ingratitude, perjury, impiety, hypocrisy, and above all upon bad kings.
He then enters the Elysian Fields, where he is known by his great
grandfather, Arcesius, who assures him that Ulysses is still alive, that
he shall see him in Ithaca, and succeed to his throne. Arcesius describes
the felicity of the just, especially of good kings, who have reverenced
the gods and given happiness to their people. He makes Telemachus
observe that heroes, those who have excelled only in the arts of
destruction, have a much less glorious reward, and are allotted a separate
district by themselves. Telemachus receives some general instructions,
and then returns back to the camp.</p>

<p>ADRASTUS, whose troops had been considerably diminished
by the battle, retired behind Mount Aulon, where he expected
a reinforcement, and watched for another opportunity of surprising
the allies; as a hungry lion<sup id="t_ref148"><a href="#t_en148">148</a></sup> that has been repulsed
from the fold, retires into the gloomy forest, enters again into
his den, and waits for some favorable moment when he may
destroy the whole flock.</p>

<p>Telemachus, having established an exact discipline among the
troops, turned his mind entirely to the execution of a design
which he had conceived, but had wholly concealed from the
commanders of the army.  He had been long disturbed in the

<!-- page 444 -->

night by dreams, in which he saw his father Ulysses.<sup id="t_ref149"><a href="#t_en149">149</a></sup> The
vision never failed to return at the end of the night, just before
the approach of Aurora, with her prevailing fires, to chase from
heaven the doubtful radiance of the stars, and from earth the
pleasing delusions of sleep. Sometimes he thought he saw
Ulysses naked upon the banks of a river, in a flowery meadow
of some blissful island, surrounded by nymphs, who threw
clothes to cover him within his reach; sometimes he thought
he heard him speaking in a palace resplendent with ivory and
gold, where a numerous audience, crowned with flowers, listened
to his eloquence with delight and admiration. Ulysses
often appeared to him suddenly among guests at a magnificent
banquet, where joy shone amid pleasures, and the soft
melody of a voice, accompanied by the lyre, gave sweeter
music than the lyre of Apollo, and the voices of all the
Muses.<sup id="t_ref150"><a href="#t_en150">150</a></sup></p>

<p>From these pleasing dreams Telemachus always awoke dejected
and sorrowful. While one of them was recent upon his
mind, he cried out: "O my father! O my dear father
Ulysses! the most frightful dreams would be more welcome to
me than these. These representations of felicity convince me
that thou art already descended to the abodes of those happy
spirits whom the gods reward for their virtue with everlasting
rest. I think I behold the fields of Elysium! How dreadful
is the loss of hope! Must I then, O my father, see thee no
more forever? Must I no more embrace him to whom I was
so dear, and whom I seek with such tender solicitude and persevering
labor? Shall I no more drink wisdom from his lips?
Shall I kiss those hands, those dear, those victorious hands,
which have subdued so many enemies, no more? Shall they
never punish the presumptuous suitors of Penelope? and shall
the glory of Ithaca be never restored?  You, ye gods, who are

<!-- page 445 -->

unpropitious to Ulysses, have sent these dreams to expel the
last hope from my breast, and leave me to despair and death!
I can no longer endure this dreadful suspense. Alas! what
have I said? Of the death of my father I am but too certain.
I will then seek his shade in the world below. To those awful
regions Theseus descended in safety; yet Theseus, with the
most horrid impiety, sought only to violate the deities of the
place: my motive, the love of my father, is consistent with my
duty to the gods. Hercules also descended and returned; I
pretend not, indeed, to his prowess, but without it I dare to
imitate his example. Orpheus, by the recital of his misfortunes,
softened into pity that deity who was thought to be inexorable,
and obtained permission for the return of Eurydice to
the world of life. I am more worthy of compassion than
Orpheus; the loss that I have sustained is greater than his.
What is a youthful beauty, to whom a thousand youthful beauties
are equal, in comparison with the wise Ulysses, the admiration
of all Greece? The attempt shall be made; and if I
perish, I perish. Why should death be dreadful, when life is
wretched? I come then, O Pluto! O Proserpine! to prove
whether ye are indeed without pity. O my father! having
traversed the earth and the seas in vain to find thee, I will
now seek thee among the gloomy dwellings of the dead. If
the gods will not permit me to possess thee upon the earth,
and enjoy with thee the light of heaven, they may perhaps
vouchsafe me the sight of thy shade in the realms
below."</p>

<p>He immediately rose from the bed which he had bedewed
with his tears, and hoped that the cheerful light of the morning
would dissipate the melancholy that he suffered from the
dreams of the night. He found, however, that the shaft which
had pierced him was still in the wound, and that he carried it
with him whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>He determined, therefore, to descend into hell by a celebrated
avenue not far from the camp. This avenue was near
a place called Acherontia, from a dreadful cavern that led
down to the banks of Acheron, an infernal river, by which the

<!-- page 446 -->

gods themselves swear with reverence and dread.<sup id="t_ref151"><a href="#t_en151">151</a></sup> The town
was built upon the summit of a rock, like a nest upon the top
of a tree. At the foot of the rock was the cavern, which no
man ventured to approach. The shepherds were always careful
to turn their flocks another way; and the sulphureous
vapor that exhaled by this aperture from the Stygian fens
made the air pestilential. The neighboring soil produced
neither herb nor flower, and in this place the gentle zephyrs,
the rising beauties of the spring, and the rich gifts of autumn.
were alike unknown.<sup id="t_ref152"><a href="#t_en152">152</a></sup> The ground was thirsty and sterile, and
presented nothing to the eye but a few naked shrubs, and the
cypress clothed with a funereal green. In the fields that surrounded
it, even at a distance, Ceres denied her golden harvests
to the plough; Bacchus never gave the delicious fruit
which he seemed to promise, for the grapes withered instead
of ripening upon the vine. The Naiads mourned, and the
waters of their urn flowed not with a gentle and translucent
wave, but were bitter to the taste and impenetrable to the eye.
Thorns and brambles here covered the ground; and, as there
was no grove for shelter, there were no birds to sing&mdash;their
strains of love were warbled beneath a milder sky&mdash;and here
nothing was to be heard but the hoarse croaking of the raven,
and the boding screams of the owl. The very herbage of the
field was bitter; and the flocks of these joyless pastures felt
not the pleasing impulse that makes them bound upon the
green. The bull turned from the heifer, and the dejected
shepherd forgot the music of his pipe.</p>

<p>A thick black smoke frequently issued from the cavern in a
cloud that covered the earth with untimely darkness in the
midst of day. At such seasons the neighboring people
doubled their sacrifices, to propitiate the infernal gods, yet
the infernal gods were frequently inexorable, and would
accept no sacrifice but youth in its sweetest bloom, and

<!-- page 447 -->

manhood in its ripest vigor, which they cut off by a fatal contagion.</p>

<p>In this place Telemachus resolved to seek the way that led
down to the dark dominions of Pluto. Minerva, who watched
over him with incessant care, and covered him with her &aelig;gis,
had rendered Pluto propitious, and at her request Jupiter himself
had commissioned Mercury, who descends daily to the infernal
regions to deliver a certain number of the dead to
Charon, to tell the sovereign of the shades it was his pleasure
that Telemachus should be permitted to enter his dominions.</p>

<p>Telemachus withdrew secretly from the camp in the night,
and, going on by the light of the moon, he invoked that powerful
divinity, who in heaven is the radiant planet of the night,
upon earth the chaste Diana, and the tremendous Hecate in
hell. The goddess heard his prayer, and accepted it, for she
knew that his heart was upright and his intention pious.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the cavern he heard the subterraneous
empire roar. The earth trembled under his feet, and the
heavens seemed to rain down fire upon his head. A secret
horror thrilled to his heart, and his limbs were covered with a
cold sweat; yet his fortitude sustained him, and lifting up his
hands and eyes to heaven he said: "Great gods, I accept
these omens, and believe them to be happy; fulfil them, and
confirm my hope!" His breast glowed with new ardor as he
spoke, and he rushed forward to the mouth of the pit.</p>

<p>The thick smoke, which rendered it fatal to all that approached
it, immediately disappeared, and the pestilential
stench was for a while suspended. He entered the cavern
alone, for who would have dared to follow him? Two Cretans
to whom he had communicated his design, and who accompanied
him part of the way, remained, pale and trembling, in a
temple at some distance, putting up prayers for his deliverance,
but despairing of his return.</p>

<p>Telemachus, in the mean time, plunged into the darkness
before him, having his sword drawn in his hand. In a few
minutes he perceived a feeble and dusky light, like that which
is seen at midnight upon the earth: he could also distinguish

<!-- page 448 -->

airy shades that fluttered round him, which he dispersed with
his sword; and soon after he discovered the mournful banks of
the Styx, whose waters, polluted by the marshes they cover,
move slowly in a sullen stream that returns in perpetual eddies
upon itself. Here he perceived an innumerable multitude of
those who, having been denied the rites of sepulture, presented
themselves to inexorable Charon in vain. Charon, whose old
age, though vigorous and immortal, is always gloomy and
severe, kept them back with menaces and reproach; but he
admitted the young Greek into his bark as soon as he came up.<sup id="t_ref153"><a href="#t_en153">153</a></sup></p>

<p>The ear of Telemachus, the moment he entered, was struck
with the groans of inconsolable grief. "Who art thou?" said
he to the complaining shade, "and what is thy misfortune?"
"I was," replied the phantom, "Nabopharzan, the king of
Babylon the Great. All the nations of the East trembled at the
sound of my name, and I compelled the Babylonians to worship
me in a temple of marble, where I was represented by a statue
of gold, before which the most costly perfumes of Ethiopia
were burnt night and day. No man contradicted me without
instant punishment, and ingenuity was constantly upon the
stretch to discover some new pleasure that might heighten the
luxury of my life. I was then in the full bloom and vigor of
youth, and life, with all its pomp and pleasures, was still
before me. But, alas! a woman whom I loved with a passion
that she did not return, too soon convinced me that I was not
a god: she gave me poison, and I now am nothing. Yesterday
they deposited my ashes with great solemnity in a golden
urn; they wept, they tore their hair, and seemed ready to
throw themselves on the funeral pile, that they might perish
with me. They are now surrounding the superb mausoleum
in which they placed my remains with all the external parade
of sorrow, but secretly, and in sincerity, I am regretted by
none. Even my family hold my memory in abhorrence, and
here I am already suffering the most horrible treatment."</p>

<!-- page 449 -->

<p>An object so deplorable touched the breast of Telemachus
with pity. "And were you then truly happy," said he, "during
your reign? Did you taste that sweet tranquillity, without
which the heart shrinks and withers like a blighted flower?"
"Far from it," replied the monarch; "I know not even what
you mean. A peace like this, indeed, has been extolled by
the sages, as the only good; but I never felt it. My heart
was perpetually agitated by new desires, and throbbing with
fear and hope. I wished that passion should perpetually succeed
to passion, with a tumultuous rapidity which excluded
thought; and practised every artifice to effect it. This was
my expedient to avoid the pangs of reflection; such was the
peace I procured, and I thought all other a fable and a dream.
Such pleasures as these I now regret."</p>

<p>During this relation, Nabopharzan wept with the effeminate
pusillanimity of a man enervated by good fortune&mdash;unacquainted
with adversity, and therefore a stranger to fortitude.
There were with him some slaves, who had been put to death
to honor his funeral, and whom Mercury had delivered to
Charon with their, king, giving them, at the same time, an
absolute power over him, who had been their tyrant upon
earth. The shades of these slaves no longer feared the shade
of Nabopharzan; they held him in a chain, and treated him
with the most cruel indignity. "As men," said one of them,
"had we not the same nature with thee? How couldst thou
be so stupid as to imagine thyself a god, and forget that thy
parents were mortal?" "His unwillingness to be taken for a
man," said another, "was right; for he was a monster, without
humanity." "Well," said another, "what has become of thy
flatterers now? Poor wretch! there is now nothing that thou
canst either give or take away; thou hast now become the
slave even of thy slaves. The justice of the gods is slow, but
it is certain."</p>

<p>Nabopharzan, stung with these insults, threw himself upon
his face in an agony of rage and despair; but Charon bade
the slaves pull him up by his chain. "He must not," said
he, "be allowed the consolation even of hiding his shame, of

<!-- page 450 -->

which all the ghosts that throng the borders of the Styx must
be witnesses, that the gods, who so long suffered this impious
tyrant to oppress the earth, may at last be justified. Yet this,
O scourge of Babylon, is but the beginning of sorrows; the
judgment of Minos, impartial and inexorable, is at hand!"</p>

<p>The bark now touched the dominions of Pluto, and the
shades ran down in crowds to the shore, gazing, with the
utmost curiosity and wonder, at the living mortal who stood
distinguished among the dead in the boat; but, the moment
Telemachus set his foot on the shore, they vanished like the
darkness of night before the first beams of morning. Then
Charon, turning towards him, with a brow less contracted into
frowns than usual, said to him: "O favored of heaven, since
thou art permitted to enter the realms of darkness, which to
all the living, besides thyself, are interdicted, make haste to go
whithersoever the Fates have called thee; proceed by this
gloomy path to the palace of Pluto, whom thou wilt find
sitting upon his throne, who will permit thee to enter those
recesses of his dominion, the secrets of which I am not permitted
to reveal."</p>

<p>Telemachus, immediately pressing forward with a hasty step,
discovered the shades gliding about on every side, more numerous
than the sands on the sea-shore; and he was struck with
a religious dread to perceive that, in the midst of the tumult
and hurry of this incredible multitude, all was silent as the
grave. He sees, at length, the gloomy residence of unrelenting
Pluto: his hair stands erect, his legs tremble, and his
voice fails him. "Tremendous power!" said he, with faltering
and interrupted speech, "the son of unhappy Ulysses now
stands before thee. I come to inquire whether my father is
descended into your dominions, or whether he is still a wanderer
upon the earth?"</p>

<p>Pluto was seated upon a throne of ebony: his countenance
was pale and severe, his eyes hollow and ardent, and his brow
contracted and menacing. The sight of a mortal still breathing
the breath of life was hateful to his eyes, as the day is
fateful to those animals that leave their recesses only by night.

<!-- page 451 -->

At his side sat Proserpine, who was the only object of his attention,
and seemed to soften him into some degree of complacency.
She enjoyed a beauty that was perpetually renewed,
but there was mingled with her immortal charms something
of her lord's inflexible severity.</p>

<p>At the foot of the throne sat the pale father of destruction,
Death, incessantly whetting a scythe which he held in his
hand. Around this horrid spectre hovered repining Cares and
injurious Suspicions; Vengeance, distained with blood and
covered with wounds; causeless Hatred; Avarice, gnawing
her own flesh; Despair, the victim of her own rage; Ambition,
whose fury overturns all things like a whirlwind; Treason,
thirsting for blood, and not able to enjoy the mischief she produces;
Envy, shedding round her the venom that corrodes
her heart, and sickening with rage at the impotence of her
malice; Impiety, that opens for herself a gulf without bottom,
in which she shall plunge at last without hope; Spectres, all
hideous to behold; Phantoms, that represent the dead to
terrify the living; frightful Dreams; and the horrid Vigils of
disease and pain. By these images of woe was Pluto surrounded:
such were the attendants that filled his palace. He
replied to the son of Ulysses in a hollow tone, and the depths
of Erebus remurmured to the sound: "If it is by fate, young
mortal, that thou hast violated this sacred asylum of the dead,
that fate, which has thus distinguished thee, fulfil. Of thy
father I will tell thee nothing; it is enough that here thou art
permitted to seek him. As upon the earth he was a king, thy
search may be confined, on one side, to that part of Tartarus
where wicked kings are consigned to punishment, and, on the
other, to that part of Elysium, where the good receive their
reward. But, from hence thou canst not enter the fields of
Elysium till thou hast passed through Tartarus. Make haste
thither, and linger not in my dominions."</p>

<p>Telemachus instantly obeyed, and passed through the dreary
vacuity that surrounded him with such speed that he seemed
almost to fly; such was his impatience to behold his father
and to quit the presence of a tyrant equally the terror of the

<!-- page 452 -->

living and the dead. He soon perceived the gloomy tract of
Tartarus at a small distance before him: from this place
ascended a black cloud of pestilential smoke, which would
have been fatal in the realms of life. This smoke hovered
over a river of fire, the flames of which, returning upon
themselves, roared in a burning vortex with a noise like that
of an impetuous torrent precipitated from the highest rock, so
that in this region of woe no other sound could be distinctly
heard.</p>

Telemachus, secretly animated by Minerva, entered the gulf
without fear. He first saw a great number of men, who, born
in a mean condition, were now punished for having sought to
acquire riches by fraud, treachery, and violence. Among
them he remarked many of those impious hypocrites, who,
affecting a zeal for religion, played upon the credulity of others,
and gratified their own ambition. These wretches, who had
abused virtue itself, the best gift of heaven, to dishonest purposes,
were punished as the most criminal of men. Children
who had murdered their parents, wives who had imbrued their
hands in their husbands' blood, and traitors who had sold their
country in violation of every tie, were punished with less
severity than these. Such was the decree pronounced by the
judges of the dead, because hypocrites are not content to be
wicked upon the common terms; they would be vicious, with
the reputation of virtue; and by an appearance of virtue,
which at length is found to be false, they prevent mankind
from putting confidence in the true. The gods, whose omniscience
they mock and whose honor they degrade, take
pleasure in the exertion of all their power to avenge the
insult.</p>

<p>After these appeared others, to whom the world scarcely
imputes guilt, but whom the divine vengeance pursues without
pity&mdash;the liar, the ingrate, the parasite who lavishes adulation
upon vice, and the slanderer who falsely detracts from virtue&mdash;all
those who judge rashly of what they know but in part, and
thus injure the reputation of the innocent.</p>

<p>But, among all who suffered for ingratitude, those were

<!-- page 453 -->

punished with most severity who had been ungrateful to the
gods. "What!" said Minos, "is he considered as a monster
who is guilty of ingratitude to his father or his friend, from
whom he has received some such benefits as mortals can bestow,
and shall the wretch glory in his crime who is ungrateful
to the gods, the givers of life and of every blessing it includes?
Does he not owe his existence rather to the authors of nature
than to the parents through whom his existence was derived?
The less these crimes are censured and punished upon earth,
the more are they obnoxious in hell to implacable vengeance,
which no force can resist and no subtlety elude."</p>

<p>Telemachus, seeing a man condemned by the judges, whom
he found sitting, ventured to ask them what was his crime.
He was immediately answered by the offender himself. "I
have done," said he, "no evil; my pleasure consisted wholly
in doing good. I have been just, munificent, liberal, and compassionate;
of what crime, then, can I be accused?" "With
respect to man," replied Minos, "thou art accused of none; but
didst thou not owe less to man than to the gods? If so, what
are thy pretensions to justice? Thou hast punctually fulfilled
thy duty to men, who are but dust; thou hast been virtuous,
but thy virtue terminated wholly in thyself, without reference
to the gods who gave it: thy virtue was to be thy own felicity,
and to thyself thou wast all in all. Thou hast, indeed, been
thy own deity. But the gods, by whom all things have been
created, and who have created all things for themselves, cannot
give up their rights: thou hast forgotten them, and they will
forget thee. Since thou hast desired to exist for thyself, and
not for them, to thyself they will deliver thee up. Seek, then,
thy consolation in thine own heart. Thou art separated forever
from man, whom, for thy own sake, thou hast desired to please,
and art left to thyself alone, that idol of thy heart. Learn now,
at least, that piety is that virtue of which the gods are the object,
and that without this no virtue can deserve the name. The
false lustre of that with which thou hast long dazzled the eyes
of men, who are easily deceived, will deceive no more. Men
distinguish that only from which they derive pain or pleasure,

<!-- page 454 -->

into virtue and vice, and are, therefore, alike ignorant both of
good and evil: but here the perspicacity of divine wisdom
discerns all things as they are; the judgment of men, from
external appearance, is reversed; what they have admired is
frequently condemned, and what they have condemned, approved."</p>

<p>These words, to the boaster of philosophic virtue, were like a
stroke of thunder, and he was unable to sustain the shock.
The self-complaisance with which he had been used to contemplate
his moderation, his fortitude, his generosity, was now
changed to despair. The view of his own heart, at enmity
with the gods, became his punishment. He now saw, and was
doomed forever to see, himself by the light of truth. He perceived
that the approbation of men, which all his actions had
been directed to acquire, was erroneous and vain. When he
looked inward, he found every thing totally changed; he was
no longer the same being, and all comfort was eradicated from
his heart. His conscience, which had hitherto witnessed in his
favor, now rose up against him, and reproached him even with
his virtues, which, not having deity for their principle and end,
were erroneous and illusive. He was overwhelmed with consternation
and trouble, with shame, remorse, and despair. The
Furies, indeed, forbore to torment him; he was delivered over
to himself, and they were satisfied; his own heart was the
avenger of the gods, whom he had despised. As he could not
escape from himself, he retired to the most gloomy recesses,
that he might be concealed from others: he sought for darkness,
but he found it not; light still persecuted and pursued
him: the light of truth, which he had not followed, now punished
him for the neglect. All that he had beheld with pleasure
became odious in his eyes, as the source of misery that
could never end. "O fool!" said he; "I have known neither
the gods, men, nor myself; I have, indeed, known nothing
since I have not known the only and true good. All my steps
have deviated from the path I should have trodden; all my
wisdom was folly and all my virtue was pride, which sacrificed,
with a blind impiety, only to that vile idol, myself!"</p>

<!-- page 455 -->

<p>The next objects that Telemachus perceived, as he went on,
were kings that had abused their power. An avenging Fury
held up before them a mirror which reflected their vices in all
their deformity. In this they beheld their undistinguishing
vanity, that was gratified by the grossest adulation; their
want of feeling for mankind, whose happiness should have
been the first object of their attention; their insensibility to
virtue, their dread of truth, their partiality to flatterers, their
dissipation, effeminacy, and indolence; their causeless suspicions;
their vain parade and ostentatious splendor, an idle
blaze, in which the public welfare is consumed; their ambition
of false honor, procured at the expense of blood; and
their inhuman luxury, which extorted a perpetual supply of
superfluous delicacies from the wretched victims of grief and
anguish. When they looked into this mirror, they saw themselves
faithfully represented; and they found the picture more
monstrous and horrid than the Chimera vanquished by Bellerophon,
the Lern&aelig;an hydra slain by Hercules, and even Cerberus
himself, though from his three howling mouths he disgorges
a stream of black venomous blood, that is sufficient to
infect the whole race of mortals that breathe upon the earth.<sup id="t_ref154"><a href="#t_en154">154</a></sup></p>

<p>At the same time another Fury tauntingly repeated all the
praises which sycophants had lavished upon them in their
lives, and held up another mirror, in which they appeared as
flattery had represented them. The contrast of these pictures,
widely different, was the punishment of their vanity. It was
remarkable that the most wicked were the objects of the most
extravagant praise; because the most wicked are most to be
feared, and because they exact, with less shame, the servile
adulation of the poets and orators of their time.</p>

<p>Their groans perpetually ascended from this dreadful abyss,
where they saw nothing but the derision and insult of which
they were themselves the objects&mdash;where every thing repulsed,
opposed, and confounded them.  As they sported with the

<!-- page 456 -->

lives of mankind upon the earth, and pretended that the whole
species were created for their use, they were, in Tartarus,
delivered over to the capricious tyranny of slaves, who made
them taste all the bitterness of servitude in their turn. They
obeyed with unutterable anguish, and without hope that the
iron hand of oppression would lie lighter upon them. Under
the strokes of these slaves, now their merciless tyrants, they
lay passive and impotent, like an anvil under the hammers of
the Cyclops, when Vulcan urges their labor at the flaming
furnaces of Mount &AElig;tna.</p>

<p>Telemachus observed the countenance of these criminals to
be pale and ghastly, strongly expressive of the torment they
suffered at the heart. They looked inward with a self-abhorrence,
now inseparable from their existence. Their crimes
themselves had become their punishment, and it was not
necessary that greater should be inflicted. They haunted
them like hideous spectres, and continually started up before
them in all their enormity. They wished for a second death
that might separate them from these ministers of vengeance,
as the first had separated their spirits from the body&mdash;a death
that might at once extinguish all consciousness and sensibility.
They called upon the depths of hell to hide them from the
persecuting beams of truth, in impenetrable darkness; but
they are reserved for the cup of vengeance, which, though
they drink of it forever, shall be ever full. The truth, from
which they fled, has overtaken them, an invincible and unrelenting
enemy. The ray which once might have illuminated
them, like the mild radiance of the day, now pierces them like
lightning&mdash;a fierce and fatal fire, that, without injury to the
external parts, infixes a burning torment at the heart. By
truth, now an avenging flame, the very soul is melted, like
metal in a furnace; it dissolves all, but destroys nothing; it
disunites the first elements of life, yet the sufferer can never
die. He is, as it were, divided against himself, without rest
and without comfort; animated by no vital principle, but the
rage that kindles at his own misconduct, and the dreadful
madness that results from despair.</p>

<!-- page 457 -->

<p>Among these objects, at the sight of which the hair of
Telemachus stood erect, he beheld many of the ancient kings
of Lydia who were punished for having preferred the selfish
gratification of an idle and voluptuous life, to that labor for
the good of others, which, to royalty, is a duty of indispensable
obligation.</p>

<p>These kings mutually reproached each other with their
folly. "Did I not often recommend to you," said one of them
to his son, "during the last years of my life, when old age had
given weight to my counsel, the reparation of the mischiefs
that my negligence had produced?" "Unhappy father!"
replied the son, "thou art the cause of my perdition; it was
thy example that made me vain-glorious, proud, voluptuous,
and cruel. While I saw thee surrounded with flattery, and
relaxed into luxury and sloth, I also insensibly acquired the
love of pleasure and adulation. I thought the rest of men
were to kings what horses and other beasts of burden are to
men&mdash;animals wholly unworthy of regard, except for the
drudgery they perform and the conveniences they procure.
This was my opinion, and I learnt it of thee. I followed thy
example, and share thy misery." These reproaches were
mingled with the most horrid execrations: mutual rage and
indignation aggravated the torments of hell.</p>

<p>Around these wretched princes there still hovered, like owls
in the twilight, causeless Jealousies and vain Alarms, Mistrust
and Dread, which revenge upon kings their disregard of mankind;
Avarice, insatiable of wealth;<sup id="t_ref155"><a href="#t_en155">155</a></sup> False-Honor, ever tyrannical
and oppressive; and effeminate Luxury, a deceitful demon
that aggravates every evil, and bestows only imaginary good.</p>

<p>Many kings were also severely punished, not for the mischief
they had done, but for the good they had neglected to
do. Every crime that is committed by the subject in consequence
of laws not enforced, is the crime of the kings, for
kings reign only as ministers of the law. To kings also are
imputed all the disorders that arise from pomp, luxury, and

<!-- page 458 -->

every other excess which excites irregular and impetuous passions
that cannot be gratified but by the violation of the common
rights of mankind. But the princes who, instead of watching
over their people as a shepherd watches over his flock,
worried and devoured them like the wolf, were punished with
the most exemplary severity.</p>

<p>In this abyss of darkness and misery, Telemachus beheld, with
yet greater astonishment, many kings who had been honored
for their personal virtues upon earth, but were, notwithstanding,
condemned to the pains of Tartarus for having left the administration
of government to wicked and crafty men. They
were punished for mischiefs which they had suffered to be perpetrated
under the sanction of their authority. The greater
part of them, indeed, had been by principle neither virtuous
nor vicious; supinely taking the color impressed upon them
from without, they did not shun the truth when it presented
itself, but they had no relish for virtue, no delight in doing
good.</p>

<p>When Telemachus left Tartarus, he felt himself relieved, as
if a mountain had been removed from his breast. This relief,
so sudden and so great, impressed him with a strong sense of
the misery of those who are confined there without hope of
deliverance. He was terrified at having seen so many kings
punished with much greater severity than any other offenders.
"Have kings, then," said he, "so many duties to fulfil, so
many difficulties to surmount, and so many dangers to avoid?
Is the knowledge that is necessary to put them upon their guard,
as well against themselves as others, so difficult to be acquired?
and, after all the envy, tumult, and opposition of a transitory
life, are they consigned to the intolerable and eternal pains of
hell? What folly, then, to wish for royalty! How happy the
peaceful private station, in which the practice of virtue is comparatively
easy!"</p>

<p>These reflections filled him with confusion and trouble; his
knees trembled, his heart throbbed with perturbation, and he
felt something of that hopeless misery which he had just witnessed.
But the further he advanced from the realms of darkness,

<!-- page 459 -->

despair, and horror, the more he felt his courage reviving
in his breast: he breathed with greater freedom, and perceived,
at a distance, the pure and blissful light which brightens the
residence of heroic virtue.</p>

<p>In this place resided all the good kings who had wisely
governed mankind from the beginning of time. They were
separated from the rest of the just; for, as wicked princes
suffer more dreadful punishment than other offenders in Tartarus,
so good kings enjoy infinitely greater felicity than other
lovers of virtue, in the fields of Elysium.</p>

<p>Telemachus advanced towards these kings, whom he found
in groves of delightful fragrance, reclining upon the downy
turf, where the flowers and herbage were perpetually renewed.
A thousand rills wandered through these scenes of delight,
and refreshed the soil with a gentle and unpolluted wave; the
song of innumerable birds echoed in the groves. Spring
strewed the ground with her flowers, while at the same time
autumn loaded the trees with her fruit. In this place the
burning heat of the dog-star was never felt, and the stormy
north was forbidden to scatter over it the frosts of winter.
Neither War that thirsts for blood, nor Envy that bites with
an envenomed tooth, like the vipers that are wreathed around
her arms and fostered in her bosom, nor Jealousy, nor Distrust,
nor Fears, nor vain Desires, invade these sacred domains of
peace. The day is here without end, and the shades of night
are unknown. Here the bodies of the blessed are clothed
with a pure and lambent light, as with a garment. This light
does not resemble that vouchsafed to mortals upon earth,
which is rather darkness visible; it is rather a celestial glory
than a light&mdash;an emanation that penetrates the grossest body
with more subtlety than the rays of the sun penetrate the
purest crystal, which rather strengthens than dazzles the sight,
and diffuses through the soul a serenity which no language
can express. By this ethereal essence the blessed are sustained
in everlasting life; it pervades them; it is incorporated
with them, as food with the mortal body; they see it, they
feel it, they breathe it, and it produces in them an inexhaustible

<!-- page 460 -->

source of serenity and joy. It is a fountain of delight, in
which they are absorbed as fishes are absorbed in the sea: they
wish for nothing, and, having nothing, they possess all things.
This celestial light satiates the hunger of the soul; every desire
is precluded; and they have a fulness of joy which sets them
above all that mortals seek with such restless ardor, to fill the
vacuity that aches forever in their breast. All the delightful
objects that surround them are disregarded, for their felicity
springs up within, and, being perfect, can derive nothing from
without. So the gods, satiated with nectar and ambrosia, disdain,
as gross and impure, all the dainties of the most luxurious
table upon earth. From these seats of tranquillity all
evils fly far away: death, disease, poverty, pain, regret, remorse,
fear, even hope&mdash;which is sometimes not less painful
than fear itself&mdash;animosity, disgust, and resentment, can never
enter there.</p>

<p>The lofty mountains of Thrace, whose summits, hoary with
everlasting snows, have pierced the clouds from the beginning
of time, might sooner be overturned from their foundations,
though deep as the centre of the earth, than the peace of
these happy beings be interrupted for a moment. They are,
indeed, touched with pity at the miseries of life; but it is a
soothing and tender passion that takes nothing from their immutable
felicity. Their countenances shine with a divine glory,
with the bloom of unfading youth, with the brightness of
everlasting joy. Their joy is superior to the wanton levity of
mirth; it is calm, silent, and solemn; it is the sublime fruition
of truth and virtue. They feel every moment what a mother
feels at the return of an only son whom she believed to be
dead; but the pleasure, which in the breast of the mother is
transient, is permanent in theirs; it can neither languish nor
cease. They have all the gladness that is inspired by wine,
without either the tumult or the folly.</p>

<p>They converse together concerning what they see, and what
they enjoy; they despise the opprobrious luxury and idle pomp
of their former condition, which they review with disgust and
regret; they enjoy the remembrance of their difficulties and

<!-- page 461 -->

distress during the short period in which, to maintain their
integrity, it was necessary they should strive, not only against
others, but themselves; and they acknowledge the guidance
and protection of the gods, who conducted them in safety
through so many dangers, with gratitude and admiration.
Something ineffable and divine is continually poured into their
hearts; something like an efflux of divinity itself, which incorporates
with their own nature. They see, they feel, that
they are happy, and are secretly conscious that they shall be
happy forever. They sing the praises of the gods as with
one voice; in the whole assembly there is but one mind and
one heart, and the same stream of divine felicity circulates
through every breast.</p>

<p>In this sacred and supreme delight whole ages glide away
unperceived, and seem shorter than the happiest hours upon
earth; and gliding ages still leave their happiness ever new
and ever complete. They reign together, not upon thrones,
which the hand of man can overturn, but in themselves, with
a power that is absolute and immutable, not derived from without,
or dependent upon a despicable and wretched multitude.
They are not distinguished by the crowns that so often conceal,
under a false lustre, the mournful gloom of anxiety and terror.
The gods themselves have placed upon their heads diadems of
everlasting splendor, the symbols and the pledge of happiness
and immortality.</p>

<p>Telemachus, who looked here for his father in vain, was so
struck with the calm but sublime enjoyments of the place, that
he was now grieved not to find him among the dead, and
lamented the necessity he was under himself of returning back
to the living. "It is here alone," said he, "that there is real
life; the shadow only, and not the reality, is to be found upon
earth." He observed, however, with astonishment, that the
number of kings that were punished in Tartarus was great,
and the number of those that were rewarded in Elysium was
small. From this he inferred that there were but few princes
whose fortitude could effectually resist their own power, and
the flattery by which their passions were continually excited.

<!-- page 462 -->

He perceived that good kings were, for this reason, rare, and
that the greater number are so wicked, that if the gods, after
having suffered them to abuse their power during life, were
not to punish them among the dead, they would cease to be
just.</p>

<p>Telemachus, not seeing his father Ulysses among these happy
few, looked round for his grandfather, the divine Laertes.
While his eyes were ineffectually employed in this search, an
old man advanced towards him, whose appearance was in the
highest degree venerable and majestic. His old age did not
resemble that of men who bend under the weight of years
upon earth; it was a kind of nameless indication that he had
been old before he died; it was something that blended all the
dignity of age with all the graces of youth, for to those who
enter the fields of Elysium, however old and decrepit, the
graces of youth are immediately restored. This venerable
figure came up hastily to Telemachus, and looked upon him
with a familiar complacency as one whom he knew and loved.
The youth, to whom he was wholly a stranger, stood silent in
confusion and suspense.</p>

<p>"I perceive, my son," said the shade, "that thou dost not
recollect me; but I am not offended. I am Arcesius, the father
of Laertes. My days upon earth were finished a little before
Ulysses, my grandson, went from Ithaca to the siege of Troy.
Thou wast yet an infant in the arms of thy nurse, but I had
then conceived hopes of thee which are now justified, since
thou hast descended into the dominions of Pluto in search of
thy father, and the gods have sustained thee in the attempt.
The gods, O fortunate youth, regard thee with peculiar love,
and will distinguish thee by glory equal to that of Ulysses. I
am happy once more to behold thee; but search for Ulysses no
more among the dead; he still lives, and is reserved to render
my line illustrious by new honors at Ithaca. Laertes himself,
though the hand of time is now heavy upon him, still draws
the breath of life, and expects that his son will return to close
his eyes. Thus transitory is man, like the flower that blows in
the morning, and in the evening is withered, and trodden

<!-- page 463 -->

under foot. One generation passes away after another, like
the waves of a rapid river; and Time, rushing on with silent but
irresistible speed, carries with him all that can best pretend to
permanence and stability. Even thou, O my son&mdash;alas! even
thou, who art now happy in the vigor, the vivacity, and the
bloom of youth, shalt find this lovely season, so fruitful of
delight, a transient flower that fades as soon as it is blown;
without having been conscious that thou wert changing, thou
wilt perceive thyself changed; the train of graces and pleasures
that now sport around thee, health, vigor, and joy, shall
vanish like the phantoms of a dream, and leave thee nothing
but a mournful remembrance that they once were thine. Old
age shall insensibly steal upon thee,&mdash;that enemy to joy shall
diffuse through thee his own languors,&mdash;shall contract thy
brow into wrinkles, incline thy body to the earth, enfeeble
every limb, and dry up forever that fountain of delight which
now springs in thy breast,&mdash;thou shalt look around upon all
that is present with disgust, anticipate all that is future with
dread, and retain sensibility only for pain and anguish.</p>

<p>"This time appears to thee to be far distant: alas! thou art
deceived; it approaches with irresistible rapidity, and is therefore
at hand: that which draws near so fast can never be
remote; and the present, forever flying, is remote already;
even while we speak it is past, and it returns no more. Let
the present, therefore, be light in thy estimation; tread the
path of virtue, however rugged, with perseverance, and fix
thine eye upon futurity. Let purity of manners and a love of
justice secure thee a place in this happy residence of peace.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt soon see thy father resume his authority in
Ithaca, and it is decreed that thou shalt succeed him on the
throne. But royalty, O my son, is a deceitful thing: those
who behold it at a distance see nothing but greatness, splendor,
and delight; those who examine it near find only toil, perplexity,
solicitude, and fear. In a private station a life of ease and
obscurity is no reproach. A king cannot prefer ease and
leisure to the painful labors of government, without infamy.
He must live, not for himself, but for those he governs.  The

<!-- page 464 -->

least fault he commits produces infinite mischief, for it diffuses
misery through a whole people, and sometimes for many generations.
It is his duty to humble the insolence of guilt, to
support innocence, and repress calumny. It is not enough to
abstain from doing evil; he must exert himself to the uttermost
in doing good. Neither will it suffice to do good as an
individual; he must prevent the mischief that others would do,
if they were not restrained. Think then of royalty, O my
son, as a state not of ease and security, but of difficulty and
danger. Call up all thy courage to resist thyself, to control
thy passions, and disappoint flattery."</p>

<p>While Arcesius was speaking, he seemed to glow with the
divine ardor of inspiration; and when he displayed the miseries
of royalty, Telemachus perceived in his countenance strong
expressions of pity. "Royalty," said he, "when it is assumed
to procure selfish indulgences, degenerates into tyranny; when
it is assumed to fulfil its duties, to govern, cherish, and protect
an innumerable people, as a father protects, cherishes, and
governs his children, it is a servitude most laborious and painful,
and requires the fortitude and patience of heroic virtue.
It is, however, certain that those who fulfil the duties of government
with diligence and integrity, shall here possess all
that the power of the gods can bestow to render happiness
complete."</p>

<p>While Telemachus listened to this discourse, it sank deep
into his heart; it was engraven upon that living tablet, as a
sculptor engraves upon brass the characters which he would
transmit to the latest generation. It was an emanation of
truth and wisdom, that like a subtle flame pervaded the most
secret recesses of his soul; it moved and warmed him at once,
and he felt his heart, as it were, dissolved by a divine energy
not to be expressed, by something that exhausted the fountain
of life. His emotion was a kind of desire that could not be
satisfied&mdash;an impulse that he could neither support nor resist&mdash;a
sensation exquisitely pleasing, and yet mixed with such pain
as it was impossible long to endure and live.</p>

<p>After some time its violence abated, he breathed with more

<!-- page 465 -->

freedom, and he discovered in the countenance of Arcesius a
strong likeness to Laertes. He had also a confused remembrance
of something similar in the features of Ulysses when
he set out for the siege of Troy.</p>

<p>This remembrance melted him into tears of tenderness and
joy; he wished to embrace a person whom he now regarded
with reverence and affection, and attempted it many times in
vain; the shade, light and unsubstantial, eluded his grasp, as
the flattering images of a dream deceive those who expect to
enjoy them:<sup id="t_ref156"><a href="#t_en156">156</a></sup> the thirsty lip is sometimes in pursuit of water
that recedes before it; sometimes the imagination forms words
which the tongue refuses to utter, and sometimes the hand is
eagerly stretched out, but can grasp nothing: so the tender
wish of Telemachus could not be gratified&mdash;he beheld Arcesius,
he heard him speak, and he spoke to him, but to touch him
was impossible. At length he inquired who the persons were
that he saw around him.</p>

<p>"You see," said the hoary sage, "those who were the ornament
of their age, and the glory and happiness of mankind.
You see the few kings who have been worthy of dominion,
and filled the character of deities upon earth. Those whom
you see not far distant, but separated from them by that small
cloud, are allotted a much inferior glory: they were heroes indeed,
but the reward of courage and prowess is much less than
that of wisdom, integrity, and benevolence.</p>

<p>"Among those heroes you see Theseus, whose countenance
is not perfectly cheerful. Some sense of his misfortune in
placing too much confidence in a false and designing woman
still remains, and he still regrets having unjustly demanded
the death of his son Hippolytus at the hands of Neptune.
Happy had it been for Theseus had he been less liable to
sudden anger! You see also Achilles, who, having been mortally
wounded in the heel by Paris, supports himself upon a

<!-- page 466 -->

spear. If he had been as eminent for wisdom, justice, and
moderation as for courage, the gods would have granted him a
long reign; but they had compassion for the nations whom he
would have governed by a natural succession, after the death of
Peleus his father, and would not leave them at the mercy of a
man more easily irritated than the sea by a tempest. The
thread of his life was cut short by the Fates, and he fell as a
flower scarcely blown falls under the ploughshare, and withers<sup id="t_ref157"><a href="#t_en157">157</a></sup>
before the day is past in which it sprung up. The gods made
use of him only as they do of torrents and tempests, to punish
men for their crimes; he was the instrument by which they
overthrew the walls of Troy, to punish the perjury of Laomedon,
and the criminal desires of Paris. When this was done
they were appeased; and they were implored in vain, even
by the tears of Thetis, to suffer a young hero to remain
longer upon the earth, who was fit only to destroy cities, to
subvert kingdoms, and to fill the world with confusion and
trouble.</p>

<p>"You see another, remarkable for the ferocity of his countenance;
that is Ajax, the son of Telamon, and the cousin of
Achilles. You cannot be ignorant of his glory in battle.
After the death of Achilles he laid claim to his arms, which
he said ought not to be given to another; but they were
claimed also by your father, who insisted upon his right: the
Greeks determined in favor of Ulysses. Ajax slew himself in
despair: the marks of rage and indignation are still visible in
his countenance. Approach him not, my son, for he will think
you come to insult the misfortune that you ought to pity.
He has discovered us already, and he rushes into the thick
shade of the wood that is behind him, to avoid a sight that is
hateful to his eyes. On the other side you see Hector, who
would have been invincible, if the son of Thetis had lived in
another age. That gliding shade is Agamemnon, whose
countenance still expresses a sense of the perfidy of Clytemnestra.

<!-- page 467 -->

O my son, the misfortunes that have avenged the
impiety of Tantalus in his family still make me tremble: the
mutual enmity of the two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, filled
the house of their father with horror and death. Alas! how
is one crime, by a kind of dreadful necessity, the cause of more!
Agamemnon returned in triumph from the siege of Troy, but
no time was allowed him to enjoy in peace the glory he had
acquired in war. Such is the fate of almost all conquerors.
All that you see have been great in battle, but they have neither
been amiable nor virtuous, and they enjoy only the second place
in the fields of Elysium.</p>

<p>"Those who have reigned with justice and loved their people,
are considered as the friends of the gods; while Achilles
and Agamemnon, still full of their quarrels and their combats,
are not perfect even here, but retain their natural defects, and
suffer the infelicity they produce. These heroes regret in vain
the life that they have lost, and grieve at their change from
substance to shade. But the kings who with an equal hand
have dispensed justice and mercy, being purified by the divine
light which perpetually renovates their being, feel their wishes
anticipated, and their happiness complete. They look back
upon the vain solicitude of mankind with compassion, and the
great affairs that busy ambition seem to them like the plays of
children. They drink of truth and virtue at the fountain
head, and are satisfied they can suffer nothing, either from
themselves or others; they have no wants, no wishes, no fears,&mdash;with
respect to them all is finished, except their joy, which
shall have no end.</p>

<p>"The venerable figure you see yonder is Inachus, who
founded the kingdom of Argos. The character of old age is
tempered with ineffable sweetness and majesty: he moves with
a light and gliding pace that resembles the flight of a bird,
and may be traced by the flowers that spring up under his
feet; he holds a lyre of ivory in his hand, and an eternal
rapture impels him to celebrate the wonders of the gods with
eternal praise. His breath is full of fragrance, like the breath
of the morning in spring; and the harmony of his voice and

<!-- page 468 -->

his lyre might add to the felicity, not only of Elysium, but of
Olympus. This is the reward of his paternal affection to the
people whom he surrounded with the walls of a new city, and
secured in the blessings of society by legislation.</p>

<p>"Among these myrtles, at a little distance, you see also
Cecrops the Egyptian, the first sovereign of Athens, a city
dedicated to the Goddess of Wisdom, whose name it bears.
Cecrops by bringing excellent laws from Egypt, the great
source from which learning and good morals have flowed
through all Greece, softened the natural ferocity of the people
that he found in the scattered villages of Attica, and united
them by the bonds of society. He was just, humane, and
compassionate; he left his people in affluence, and his family
in mediocrity; for he was not willing that his children should
succeed to his power, because there were others whom he
judged more worthy of the trust.</p>

<p>"But I must now show you Ericthon: you see him in that
little valley. Ericthon was the first who introduced the use of
silver as money, in order to facilitate commerce among the
islands of Greece; but he foresaw the inconveniences which
would naturally result from his invention. 'Apply yourselves,'
he said to the people, 'to accumulate natural riches, for they
only deserve the name. Cultivate the earth, that you may
have wealth in corn and wine, oil and fruit; multiply your
flocks to the utmost, that you may be nourished by their milk,
and clothed with their wool, and it will then be impossible
that you should be poor. The increase even of your children
will be the increase of your wealth, if you inure them early
to diligence and labor; for the earth is inexhaustible, and will
be more fruitful in proportion as it is cultivated by more
Lands: it will reward labor with boundless liberality, but to
idleness it will be parsimonious and severe. Seek principally,
therefore, for that which is truly wealth, as it supplies that
which is truly want. Make no account of money, but as it is
useful either to support necessary wars abroad, or for the purchase
of such commodities as are wanted at home: still it
would be desirable that no commerce should be carried on in

<!-- page 469 -->

articles that can only support and gratify luxury, vanity, and
sloth.</p>

<p>" 'My children,' said the wise Ericthon, who thought frequent
admonition necessary, 'I greatly fear that I have made
you a fatal present. I foresee that this money will excite avarice
and ambition, the lust of the eye and the pride of life;
that it will produce innumerable arts, which can only corrupt
virtue and gratify idleness; that it will destroy your relish for
that happy simplicity which is at once the blessing and the
security of life; and that it will make you look with contempt
upon agriculture, the support of our existence, and the source
of every valuable possession. But I call the gods to witness
that I made you acquainted with money, a thing useful in
itself, in the integrity of my heart!' Ericthon, however, having
lived to see the mischiefs that he dreaded come to pass,
retired, overwhelmed with grief, to a desert mountain, where
he lived to an extreme old age, in poverty and solitude, disgusted
with government, and deploring the folly of mankind.</p>

<p>"Not long afterwards Greece beheld a new wonder in Triptolemus,
to whom Ceres had taught the art of cultivating the
earth, and of covering it every year with a golden harvest.
Mankind were indeed already acquainted with corn, and the
manner of multiplying it by seed, but they knew only the first
rudiments of tillage; and Triptolemus, being sent by Ceres,
came, with the plough in his hand, to offer the bounty of that
goddess to all who had spirit to surmount the natural love of
ease, and apply themselves diligently to labor. The Greeks
soon learnt of Triptolemus to part the earth into furrows, and
render it fertile by breaking up the surface. The yellow corn
soon strewed the fields under the sickle of the reapers. Even
the wandering barbarians that were dispersed in the forests of
Epirus and Etolia, seeking acorns for their subsistence, when
they had learnt to sow corn and make bread, threw off their
ferocity, and submitted to the laws of civil society.</p>

"Triptolemus made the Greeks sensible of the pleasure that
is to be found in that independent wealth which a man derives
from his own labor, and in the possession of all the necessaries

<!-- page 470 -->

and conveniences of life as the genuine produce of his own
field. This abundance, so simple and so blameless, arising
from agriculture, recalled to their minds the counsel of Ericthon.
They held money in contempt, and all other factitious
wealth, which has no value but in the imaginations which
tempts men to dangerous pleasures, and diverts them from that
labor which alone supplies all that is of real value with innocence
and liberty. They were now convinced that a paternal
field, with a kindly soil and diligent cultivation, was the best
inheritance for those who were wisely content with the simple
plenty that contented their fathers. Happy would it have
been for the Greeks if they had steadily adhered to these
maxims, so fit to render them free, powerful, and happy; and
to inspire and maintain a uniform and active virtue, which
would have made them worthy of such blessings! But, alas!
they began to admire false riches; by degrees they neglected
the true, and they degenerated from this admirable simplicity.</p>

<p>"O my son, the sceptre of thy father shall one day descend
to thee; in that day remember to lead thy people back to agriculture,
to honor the art, to encourage those that practise it,
and to suffer no man either to live in idleness, or employ himself
only to propagate luxury and sloth. These men, who
governed with such benevolence and wisdom upon earth, are
here the favorites of heaven. They were, in comparison with
Achilles and other heroes, who excelled only in war, what the
gentle and genial gales of spring are to the desolating storms
of winter; and they now as far surpass them in glory as the
sun surpasses the moon in splendor."</p>

<p>While Arcesius was thus speaking, he perceived that Telemachus
had fixed his eyes upon a little grove of laurels, and a
rivulet of pure water that was bordered with roses, violets,
lilies, and a thousand other odoriferous flowers, the vivid colors
of which resembled those of Iris, when she descends upon
earth with some message from the gods to man. He saw in
this delightful spot an inhabitant of Elysium, whom he knew
to be Sesostris. There was now a majesty in the appearance
of this great prince infinitely superior to that which distinguished

<!-- page 471 -->

him upon the throne of Egypt. His eyes sparkled
with a divine radiance that Telemachus could not steadfastly
behold. He appeared to have drank, even to excess, of immortality
and joy: such was the rapture, beyond all that
mortals have the power to feel, which the divine spirit, as the
reward of virtue, had poured into his breast.</p>

<p>"O my father," said Telemachus to Arcesius, "I know him;
it is Sesostris, the wise and good, whom I beheld, not long
since, upon his throne in Egypt."</p>

<p>"It is he," replied Arcesius; "and in him you have an example
of the boundless liberality with which good kings are
rewarded by the gods; yet all the felicity which now overflows
in his bosom and sparkles in his eyes, is nothing in comparison
of what he would have enjoyed, if, in the excess of his
prosperity, he had been still moderate and just. An ardent
desire to abase the pride and insolence of the Tyrians, impelled
him to take their city. This acquisition kindled a desire
of more, and he was seduced by the vain-glory of a conqueror:
he subdued, or rather he ravaged all Asia. At his
return into Egypt, he found the throne usurped by his brother,
who had rendered the best laws of the country ineffectual, by
an iniquitous administration. His conquest of other kingdoms,
therefore, served only to throw his own into confusion;
yet he was so intoxicated with the vanity of conquest, that he
harnessed the princes whom he had subdued to his chariot.<sup id="t_ref158"><a href="#t_en158">158</a></sup>
This was less excusable than all the rest; but he became, at
length, sensible of his fault and ashamed of his inhumanity.
Such was the fruit of his victories; and the great Sesostris
has left an example of the injury done by a conqueror to his
country and himself when he usurps the dominions of others.
This degraded the character of a prince in other respects so
just and beneficent; and this has diminished the glory which
the gods intended for his reward.</p>

<p>"But seest thou not another shade, my son, distinguished
by a wound, and a lambent light that plays around it like a

<!-- page 472 -->

glory? That is Dioclides, a king of Caria, who voluntarily
gave up his life in battle because an oracle had foretold that
in a war between the Carians and Lycians, the nation whose
king should be slain would be victorious.</p>

<p>"Observe yet another: that is a wise legislator, who, having
instituted such laws as could not fail to render his people virtuous
and happy, and bound them by a solemn oath not to
violate them in his absence, immediately disappeared, became
a voluntary exile from his country, and died poor and unnoticed
on a foreign shore, that his people might, by that oath,
be obliged to keep his laws inviolate forever.</p>

<p>"He, whom thou seest not far off from these, is Eunesimus,
a king of Pylos and an ancestor of Nestor. During a pestilence
that desolated the earth and crowded the banks of Acheron
with shades newly dismissed from above, he requested of
the gods that he might be permitted to redeem the lives of
his people with his own. The gods granted his request, and
have here rewarded it with felicity and honor, in comparison of
which all that royalty upon earth can bestow is vain and unsubstantial,
like a shadow or a dream.</p>

<p>"That old man whom you see crowned with flowers is
Belus. He reigned in Egypt, and espoused Anchinoe, the
daughter of the god Nilus, who fertilizes the earth with a flood
that he pours over it from a secret source. He had two sons,&mdash;Danaus,
whose history you know, and Egyptus, from whom
that mighty kingdom derives its name. Belus thought himself
more enriched by the plenty which he diffused among his
people and the love that he acquired in return, than by all the
levies he could have raised if he had taxed them to the utmost.
These, my son, whom you believe to be dead, these only are
the living; those are the dead who languish upon earth, the
victims of disease and sorrow: the terms are inverted, and
should be restored to their proper place. May the gods vouchsafe
thee such virtue as this life shall reward&mdash;a life which
nothing shall embitter or destroy. But haste thee, now, from
this world to which thou art yet unborn: it is time the search
for thy father should be renewed.  Alas! what scenes of blood

<!-- page 473 -->

shalt thou behold before he is found! What glory awaits
thee in the fields of Hesperia! Remember the counsels of
Mentor: let these be the guide of thy life, and thy name shall
be great to the utmost limits of the earth and the remotest
period of time!"</p>

<p>Such was the admonition of Arcesius, and he immediately
conducted Telemachus to the ivory<sup id="t_ref159"><a href="#t_en159">159</a></sup> gate that leads from the
gloomy dominions of Pluto. Telemachus parted from him
with tears in his eyes; but it was not possible to embrace him;
and, leaving behind him the shades of everlasting night, he
made haste back to the camp of the allies, having joined the
two young Cretans in his way, who had accompanied him to
the mouth of the cavern and despaired of his return.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 474 -->

<h2 class="center" id="tb15">BOOK XV.</h2>

<p class="small">Venusium having been left as a deposit by both parties in the hands of the
Lucanians, Telemachus declares against seizing it in an assembly of the
chiefs, and persuades them to be of his opinion. He discovers great
penetration and sagacity with respect to two deserters, one of whom,
Acanthus, had undertaken to poison him; and the other, Dioscorus, had
offered to bring him Adrastus' head. In the battle which soon after
follows, Telemachus strews the field with dead in search of Adrastus.
Adrastus, who is also in search of Telemachus, engages and kills Pisistratus,
the son of Nestor; Philoctetes comes up, and, at the moment
when he is about to pierce Adrastus, is himself wounded, and obliged to
retire. Telemachus, alarmed by the cry of his friends, among whom
Adrastus is making a terrible slaughter, rushes to their assistance. He
engages Adrastus, and prescribes conditions upon which he gives him
his life. Adrastus, rising from the ground, attempts treacherously to
kill his conqueror by surprise, who engages him a second time, and kills
him.</p>

<p>IN the mean time, the chiefs assembled in council to deliberate
whether they should take possession of Venusium. It
was a strong town that had been formerly taken by Adrastus
from a neighboring people, the Peucetian Apulians, who had
now entered into the alliance that was formed against him, to
obtain satisfaction for the injury. Adrastus, to soften their
resentment, had put the town into the hands of the Lucanians:
he had, however, at the same time corrupted the Lucanian
garrison and its commander with money, so that he had
still more authority in Venusium than the Lucanians; and
the Apulians, who had consented that Venusium should be
garrisoned with Lucanian forces, were thus defrauded in the
negotiation.</p>

<p>A citizen of Venusium, whose name was Demophantes, had
secretly offered to put the allies in possession of one of the
gates by night; an advantage which was of the greater importance,
as Adrastus had placed his magazine of military stores

<!-- page 475 -->

and provisions in a neighboring castle, which could not hold
out against an enemy that was in possession of Venusium.
Philoctetes and Nestor had already given their opinion that
this offer should be accepted. The rest of the chiefs, influenced
by their authority, and struck with the facility of the
enterprise and its immediate advantages, applauded their determination;
but Telemachus, as soon as he returned, exerted
his utmost abilities to set it aside.</p>

<p>"I confess," said he, "that if any man can deserve to be
surprised and deceived, it is Adrastus, who has practised fraud
against everybody. I am sensible that the surprise of Venusium
will only put you in possession of a town which by right
is yours already, because it belongs to the Apulians, who are
confederates in your expedition. I also acknowledge that you
may improve this opportunity with the greater appearance of
justice, as Adrastus, who has made a deposit of the town in
question, has at the same time corrupted the commander and
the garrison, to suffer him to enter it whenever he shall think
fit. In fine, I am convinced, as well as you, that if you should
take possession of Venusium to-day you would to-morrow be
masters of the neighboring castle, in which Adrastus has
formed his magazine, and that, the day following, this formidable
war would be at an end. But is it not better to perish
than to conquer by means like these? Must fraud be counteracted
by fraud? Shall it be said that so many kings, who
united to punish the perfidy of Adrastus, were themselves perfidious?
If we can adopt the practices of Adrastus without
guilt, Adrastus himself is innocent, and our attempt to punish
him injurious. Has all Hesperia&mdash;sustained by so many colonies
of Greece, by so many heroes returned from the siege of Troy&mdash;no
other arms to oppose the fraud and treachery of Adrastus
than treachery and fraud?</p>

<p>"You have sworn by all that is most sacred to leave Venusium
a deposit in the hands of the Lucanians. The Lucanian
garrison, you say, is corrupted by Adrastus, and I believe it to
be true, but this garrison is still Lucanian; it receives the pay
of the Lucanians, and has not yet refused to obey them; it

<!-- page 476 -->

has preserved, at least, an appearance of neutrality; neither
Adrastus nor his people have yet entered it; the treaty is still
subsisting, and the gods have not forgotten your oath. Is a
promise never to be kept but when a plausible pretext to break
it is wanting? Shall an oath be sacred only when nothing is
to be gained by its violation? If you are insensible to the
love of virtue and fear of the gods, have you no regard to
your interest and reputation? If you give so pernicious an
example to mankind, by breaking your promise and violating
your oath, in order to put an end to a war, how many wars
will this impious conduct excite? By which of your neighbors
will you not be at once dreaded and abhorred? By whom will
you afterwards be trusted in the most pressing necessity?
What security can you give for your faith, when you design to
keep it; and how will you convince your neighbors that you
intend no fraud, even when you are sincere? Shall this
security be a solemn treaty?&mdash;you have trodden treaties under
foot. Shall it be an oath?&mdash;will not they know that you have
set the gods at defiance when you can derive any advantage
from perjury? With respect to you, peace will be a state of
no greater security than war. Whatever you do will be considered
as the operation of war, either secret or avowed.
You will be the constant enemies of all who have the misfortune
to be your neighbors. Every affair which requires reputation,
probity, or confidence, will to you become impracticable,
and you will never be able to make any promise that can
be believed.</p>

<p>"But there is another interest yet nearer and more pressing
which must strike you, if you are not lost to all sense of probity,
and wholly blind to your advantage: a conduct so perfidious
will be a canker in the very heart of your alliance, which it
must finally destroy. The fraud that you are about to practise
against Adrastus, will inevitably render him victorious."</p>

<p>At these words the assembly demanded, with great emotion,
how he could take upon him to affirm that the alliance
would be ruined by a measure that would procure them certain
and immediate victory.</p>

<!-- page 477 -->

<p>"How can you," said he, "confide in each other, if you
violate the only bond of society and confidence&mdash;your plighted
faith? After you have admitted this maxim, that the laws of
honesty and truth may be violated to secure a considerable
advantage, who among you would confide in another, when
that other may secure a considerable advantage by breaking
his promise and defrauding you? When this is the case, what
will be your situation? Which of you would not practise
fraud, to preclude the fraudulent practises of his neighbor?
What must become of an alliance consisting of so many nations,
each of which has a separate interest, when it is agreed
among them, in a public deliberation, that every one is at
liberty to circumvent his neighbor and violate his engagements?
Will not the immediate consequence be distrust and
dissension; an impatience to destroy each other, excited by
the dread of being destroyed? Adrastus will have no need to
attack you; you will effect his purpose upon yourselves, and
justify the perfidy you combined to punish.</p>

<p>"Ye mighty chiefs, renowned for magnanimity and wisdom,
who govern innumerable people with experienced command,
despise not the counsel of a youth. Whatever is your
danger and distress, your resources should be diligence and
virtue. True fortitude can never despair; but if once you
pass the barrier of integrity and honor, your retreat is cut off,
and your ruin inevitable&mdash;you can never more establish that
confidence without which no affair of importance can succeed&mdash;you
can never make those hold virtue sacred whom
you have once taught to despise it. And, after all, what have
you to fear? Will not your courage conquer without so base
an auxiliary as fraud? Are not your own powers and the
strength of united nations sufficient? Let us fight, and if we
must, let us die; but let us not conquer with the loss of virtue
and of fame. Adrastus, the impious Adrastus, is in our power,
and nothing can deliver him but our participation in the crimes
that expose him to the wrath of heaven."</p>

<p>When Telemachus had done speaking, he perceived that his
words had carried conviction to the heart.  He observed that

<!-- page 478 -->

of all who were present not one offered to reply; their thoughts
were fixed, not indeed upon him, nor the graces of his elocution,
but upon the truths that he had displayed. At first, all
was silent astonishment, expressed only by the countenance;
but after a short time a confused murmur spread by degrees
through the whole assembly: they looked upon each other,
and all were impatient to declare their sentiments, though every
one was afraid to speak first. It was expected that the chiefs
of the army should give their opinion, and the venerable Nestor
at length spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"The gods, O son of Ulysses, have spoken by thy voice;
Minerva, who has so often inspired thy father, has suggested
to thee the wise and generous counsel thou hast given us. I
think not of thy youth, for when I hear thee, Pallas only is
present to my mind. Thou hast been the advocate of virtue.
The greatest advantage without virtue is lost; without virtue,
men are suddenly overtaken by the vengeance of their enemies,
they are distrusted by their friends, abhorred by good
men, and exposed to the righteous anger of the gods. Let us
then leave Venusium in the hands of the Lucanians, and think
of defeating Adrastus only by our own courage."</p>

<p>Thus Nestor spoke, and the whole assembly applauded; but
their eyes were fixed upon Telemachus, and every one thought
he saw the wisdom of the goddess that inspired him, glowing
in his countenance.</p>

<p>This question being determined, the council began immediately
to debate another, in which Telemachus acquired equal
reputation. Adrastus, with a perfidy and cruelty natural to
his character, had sent one Acanthus into the camp as a deserter,
who had undertaken to destroy the principal commanders
of the army by poison, and had a particular charge not
to spare Telemachus, who had already become the terror of
the Daunians. Telemachus, who was too generous and brave
easily to entertain suspicion, readily admitted this wretch to
his presence, and treated him with great kindness; for, having
seen Ulysses in Sicily, he recommended himself by relating his
adventures. Telemachus took him under his immediate protection,

<!-- page 479 -->

and consoled him under his misfortunes, for he pretended
to have been defrauded and treated with indignity by
Adrastus. Telemachus, however, was warming and cherishing
a viper in his bosom that was quite ready to give him a
mortal wound.</p>

<p>Acanthus had dispatched another deserter, whose name was
Arion, from the camp of the allies to Adrastus, with particular
intelligence of his situation, and assurances that he would give
poison to the chief commanders, and in particular to Telemachus,
the next day at an entertainment, to which he had been
invited as a guest. It happened that this man was detected and
seized as he was escaping from the camp, and in the terror and
confusion of conscious guilt he confessed his treachery. Acanthus
was suspected of having been his accomplice, because a
remarkable intimacy had been observed between them; but
Acanthus, who had great courage, and was profoundly skilled
in dissimulation, made so artful a defence that nothing could
be proved against him, nor could the conspiracy be traced to
its source.</p>

<p>Many of the princes were of opinion that he ought certainly
to be sacrificed to the public safety. "He must, at all
events," said they, "be put to death; for the life of a private
individual is nothing in comparison with the lives of so many
kings. It is possible he may die innocent, but that consideration
should have no weight, when the vicegerents of the gods
are to be secured from danger."</p>

<p>"This horrid maxim," said Telemachus, "this barbarous
policy, is a disgrace to human nature. Is the blood of men to
be so lightly spilt, and are they to be thus wantonly destroyed
by those that are set over them only for their preservation?
The gods have made you to mankind what the shepherd is to
his flock, and will you degrade yourselves into wolves, and
worry and devour those whom you ought to cherish and protect?
Upon your principle, to be accused and to be guilty is
the same thing, and every one that is suspected must die.
Envy and calumny will destroy innocence at pleasure; the oppressed
will be sacrificed to the oppressor, and in proportion

<!-- page 480 -->

as tyranny makes kings distrustful, judicial murderers will depopulate
the State."</p>

<p>Telemachus uttered this remonstrance with a vehemence
and authority that gave it invincible force, and covered those
who gave the counsel he had reproved with confusion. He perceived
it, and softened his voice. "As for myself," said he, "I
am not so fond of life as to secure it upon such terms. I had
rather Acanthus should be wicked than Telemachus, and
would more willingly perish by his treason than destroy him
unjustly, while I doubt his crime. A king is, by his office, the
judge of his people, and his decision should be directed by
wisdom, justice, and moderation: let me, then, examine Acanthus
in your presence."</p>

<p>Every one acquiesced, and Telemachus immediately questioned
him concerning his connection with Arion. He pressed
him with a great variety of particulars, and he frequently took
occasion to intimate a design of sending him back to Adrastus
as a deserter: this, if he had really deserted, would have
alarmed him; for Adrastus would certainly have punished him
with death: but Telemachus, who watched the effect of this
experiment with great attention, perceived not the least token
of fear either in his countenance or his voice, and therefore,
thought it probable that he was guilty of conspiracy. Not
being able, however, fully to convict him, he demanded his
ring. "I will send it," said he, "to Adrastus." At this demand
Acanthus turned pale. Telemachus, who kept his eyes
fixed upon him, perceived that he was in great confusion. The
ring being delivered, Telemachus said: "I will send Polytropus,
a Lucanian, whom you well know, to Adrastus, as a messenger
dispatched with private intelligence from you, and he
shall produce this ring as a token. If it is acknowledged by
Adrastus, and by this means we discover that you are his
emissary, you shall be put to death by torture; but if you will
now voluntarily confess your guilt, we will remit the punishment
it deserves, and only banish you to some remote island,
where every thing shall be provided for your subsistence."
Acanthus, being now urged both by fear and hope, made a full

<!-- page 481 -->

confession, and Telemachus prevailed with the kings to give
him his life, as he had promised it. He was sent into one of
the Echinadian islands, where he passed his days in security
and peace.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, a Daunian of obscure birth, but of a
daring and violent spirit, whose name was Dioscorus, came into
the camp of the allies by night, and offered to assassinate
Adrastus in his tent. This offer it was in his power to make
good, for whoever despises his own life, can command that of
another. Dioscorus had no wish but for revenge, for Adrastus
had forcibly taken away his wife whom he loved to distraction,
and who was equal in beauty to Venus herself. He had determined
either to kill the tyrant and recover his wife, or
perish in the attempt. He had received secret instructions
how to enter the tent in the night, and had learnt that his
enterprise would be favored by many officers in the service;
but he thought that it would also be necessary that the allies
should attack the camp at the same time, as the confusion
would facilitate his escape, and afford him a fairer opportunity
to carry off his wife.</p>

<p>As soon as this man had made the confederate princes acquainted
with his design, they turned towards Telemachus, as
referring implicitly to his decision.</p>

<p>"The gods," said he, "who have preserved us from traitors,
forbid us to employ them. It would be our interest to reject
treachery if we had not sufficient virtue to detest it; if we
should once practise it against others, our example would
justify others in the practice of it against us. Then who
among us will be safe? If Adrastus should avoid the mischief
that threatens him, it will recoil upon ourselves. The nature
of war will be changed; military skill and heroic virtue will
have no object, and we shall see nothing but perfidy, treason,
and assassination. We shall ourselves experience their fatal
effects, and deserve to suffer every evil to which we have given
sanction by our practice. I am, therefore, of opinion that we
ought to send back this traitor to Adrastus&mdash;not for his sake,
indeed, but the eyes of all Hesperia, and of all Greece, are

<!-- page 482 -->

upon us, and we owe this testimony of our abhorrence of perfidy
to them and to ourselves; we owe it also to the gods, for
the gods are just."</p>

<p>Dioscorus was sent away to Adrastus, who trembled at the
review of his danger, and was beyond expression amazed at
the generosity of his enemies, for the wicked have no idea of
disinterested virtue. He contemplated what had happened with
admiration, and a secret and involuntary praise; but he did
not dare to applaud it openly, being conscious that it would
condemn himself; it brought into his mind the fraud and
cruelty he had practised, with a painful sense both of guilt
and shame. He endeavored to account for appearances, without
imputing to his enemies such virtue as he could not emulate;
and, while he felt himself indebted to them for his life
he could not think of ingratitude without compunction; but,
in those who are habitually wicked, remorse is of short duration.
Adrastus, who saw the reputation of the allies perpetually
increasing, thought it absolutely necessary to attempt
something of importance against them immediately. As he
found they must of necessity foil him in virtue, he could only
hope to gain advantage over them in arms, and therefore prepared
to give them battle without delay.</p>

<p>The day of action arrived, and Aurora had scarcely strewed
her roses<sup id="t_ref160"><a href="#t_en160">160</a></sup> in the path of the sun, and thrown open the gates
of the east before him, when Telemachus, anticipating the
vigilance of experience and age, broke from the soft embraces
of sleep and put all the commanders in motion. His helmet,
covered with horse-hair that floated in the wind, already glittered
upon his head; his cuirass on his back dazzled the eyes
of the whole army; and his shield, the work of Vulcan, had,
besides its natural beauty, a divine effulgence, which it derived
from the &aelig;gis of Minerva that was concealed under it. In one
hand he held a lance, and, with the other, he pointed out the
posts which the several divisions of the army were to occupy.</p>

<!-- page 483 -->

<p>Minerva had given a fire to his eye that was more than
human, and animated his countenance with an expression of
awful majesty that seemed to be an earnest of victory. He
marched, and all the princes of the confederacy, forgetting
their dignity and their age, followed him by an irresistible impulse.
Their hearts were inaccessible even to envy; and
every one yielded, with a spontaneous obedience, to him who
was under the immediate but invisible conduct of Minerva.
There was now nothing impetuous or precipitate in his deportment;
he possessed himself with the most placid tranquillity
and condescending patience; he was ready to hear
every opinion, and to improve every hint; but he showed also
the greatest activity, vigilance, and foresight; he provided
against the remotest contingencies; he was neither disconcerted
himself, nor disconcerted by others; he excused all
mistakes, regulated all that was amiss, and obviated difficulties,
even in their causes, before they could take effect; he exacted
no unreasonable service, left every man at liberty, and
enjoyed every man's confidence.</p>

<p>When he gave an order, he expressed himself with the
greatest plainness and perspicuity; he repeated it, to assist the
apprehension and memory of those that were to execute it.
He consulted their looks while he was speaking, to know
whether he was perfectly understood, and he made them express
their sense of his orders in their own words. When he
had satisfied himself of the abilities of the persons he employed,
and perceived that they perfectly entered into his
views, he never dismissed them without some mark of his
esteem and confidence. All, therefore, that were engaged in
the execution of his designs, were interested in success, from
a principle of love to their commander, whom they wished,
more than all things, to please. Nor was their activity restrained
by the fear of having misfortune imputed to them as
a fault, for he blamed none that were unsuccessful by mistake,
if their intentions appeared to have been good.</p>

<p>The first rays of the sun now tinged the horizon with a
glowing red, and the sea sparkled with the reflected fires of

<!-- page 484 -->

the rising day. The plain was thronged with men and arms
and horses and chariots were everywhere in motion. An
almost infinite variety of sounds produced a loud but confused
noise, like that of the sea, when a mighty tempest, at the command
of Neptune, moves the world of waters to its foundation.
Mars, by the din of arms, and the dreadful apparatus of war,
began to scatter the seeds of rage in every breast. Spears
stood erect in the field as thick as corn that hides the furrows
of the plough in autumn. A cloud of dust rose in the air,
which hid both heaven and earth by degrees from the sight of
man. Inexorable Death advanced, with Confusion, Horror,
and Carnage in his train.</p>

<p>The moment the first flight of arrows were discharged, Telemachus,
lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, pronounced
these words: "O Jupiter, father both of gods and men! thou
seest justice on our side; and peace, which we have not been
ashamed to seek. We draw the sword with reluctance, and
would spare the blood of man. Against even this enemy,
however cruel, perfidious, and profane, we have no malice.
Judge, therefore, between him and us. If we must die, it is
thy hand that resumes the life it has given. If Hesperia is to
be delivered, and the tyrant abased, it is thy power, and the
wisdom of Minerva, that shall give us victory. The glory will
be due to thee, for the fate of battle is weighed in thy balance.
We fight in thy behalf, for thou art righteous; and Adrastus
is therefore more thy enemy than ours. If, in thy behalf
we conquer, the blood of a whole hecatomb shall smoke upon
thy altars before the day is past."</p>

<p>Then, shaking the reins over the fiery and foaming coursers
of his chariot, he rushed into the thickest of the enemy. The
first that opposed him was Periander the Locrian, covered
with the skin of a lion, which he had slain while he was travelling
in Cilicia. He was armed, like Hercules, with a club of
enormous size; he had the stature and the strength of a giant.
As soon as he saw Telemachus, he despised his youth and the
beauty of his countenance. "Is it for thee," said he, "effeminate
boy, to dispute the glory of arms with us? Hence, child,

<!-- page 485 -->

and seek thy father in the dominions of the dead!" He spoke,
and lifted up his ponderous and knotted mace against him; it
was studded with spikes of steel, and had the appearance of a
mast. All that were near trembled at its descent; but Telemachus
avoided the blow, and rushed upon his enemy with a
rapidity equal to the flight of an eagle. The mace, falling upon
the wheel of a chariot that was near him, dashed it to pieces.
Before Periander could recover it, Telemachus pierced his neck
with a dart. The blood, which gushed in a torrent from the
wound, instantly stifled his voice; his hand relaxed; and the
reins falling upon the neck of his coursers, they started away
with ungoverned fury. He fell from the chariot; his eyes were
suffused with everlasting darkness; on his disfigured countenance
was depicted pale death. Telemachus was touched
with pity at the sights and immediately gave the body to his
attendants, reserving to himself the lion's skin and mace as
trophies of victory.</p>

<p>He then sought Adrastus in the thickest of the battle, and
overturned a crowd of heroes in his way: Hyleus, who had
harnessed to his chariot two coursers, bred in the vast plains
that are watered by the Ausidius, and scarcely inferior to those
of the sun; Demoleon, who, in Sicily, had almost rivalled Eryx
in combats with the cestus; Crantor, who had been the host
and the friend of Hercules, when he passed through Hesperia
to punish the villainies of Cacus with death; Menecrates, who,
in wrestling, was said to have rivalled Pollux; Hippoco&ouml;n the
Salapian, who, in managing the horse, had the grace and dexterity
of Castor; the mighty hunter Eurymedes, who was
always stained with the blood of bears and wild boars that he
slew upon the frozen summits of the Apennines, and who was
said to have been so great a favorite of Diana, that she taught
him the use of the bow herself; Nicostrates, who had conquered
a giant among the rocks of Mount Garganus, that
vomited fire; and Cleanthus, who was betrothed to the youthful
Pholoe, daughter of the river Liris. She had been promised,
by her father, to him who should deliver her from a winged
serpent, which was bred on the borders of the stream, and

<!-- page 486 -->

which an oracle had predicted should, in a few days, devour
her. Cleanthus, for the love of Pholoe, undertook to destroy
the monster, and succeeded; but the Fates withhold him from
the fruits of his victory; and, while Pholoe was preparing for
their union, and expecting the return of her hero with a tender
and timid joy, she learned that he had followed Adrastus to
the war, and that his life was cut off by an untimely stroke.
Her laments were borne to the surrounding woods and mountains
upon every breeze; her eyes were burdened with tears;
the flowers which she had wreathed into garlands were neglected;
she tore out her beautiful blonde hair, and, in the distraction
of her grief, accused heaven of injustice. But the
gods beheld her with compassion, and, accepting the prayers
of her father, put an end to her distress. Her tears flowed in
such abundance, that she was suddenly changed into a fountain,
which at length mingled with the parent stream; but the
waters are still bitter; no herbage blooms upon its banks, and
no tree but the cypress refreshes them with a shade.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Adrastus, who had learned that Telemachus
was spreading terror on every side, went in search of
him with the utmost ardor and impatience. He hoped to find
him an easy conquest, as he had yet scarcely acquired the
strength of a man. The tyrant did not, however, trust wholly
to this advantage, but took with him thirty Daunians, of uncommon
boldness, dexterity, and strength, to whom he had
promised great rewards for killing Telemachus in any manner.
If, at this time, they had met, and the thirty Daunians had
surrounded the chariot of the young hero while Adrastus had
attacked him in front, he would certainly have been cut off
without difficulty; but Minerva turned this formidable band
another way.</p>

<p>Adrastus, thinking he distinguished the voice and figure of
Telemachus among a crowd of combatants that were engaged
in a small hollow at the foot of a hill, rushed to the spot, that
be might satiate his revenge; but instead of Telemachus he
found Nestor, who, with a feeble hand, threw some random
shafts that did no execution.  Adrastus, in the rage of disappointment,

<!-- page 487 -->

would instantly have slain him if a troop of Pylians
had not surrounded their king.</p>

<p>And now a multitude of arrows obscured the day, and covered
the contending armies like a cloud. Nothing was to be
heard but the groans of death, and the clashing armor of those
that fell. The ground was loaded with mountains of slain, and
deluged with rivers of blood. Mars and Bellona, attended by
the infernal Furies, and clothed in garments that dropped with
gore, enjoyed the horrors of the battle, and animated the combatants
with new fury. By these relentless deities, enemies to
man, Pity, generous Valor, and mild Humanity were driven
from the field. Slaughter, Revenge, Despair, and Cruelty
raged amid the tumult without control. Minerva, the wise and
invincible, shuddered, and turned with horror from the scene.</p>

<p>Philoctetes, in the mean time, though he walked with difficulty
with the shafts of Hercules, limped to the assistance of
Nestor with all his might. Adrastus, not being able to penetrate
the guard of Pylians that surrounded him, laid many of
them in the dust. He slew Ctesilas, who was so light of foot
that he scarcely imprinted the sand, and in his own country
left the rapid waves of Eurotas and Alpheus behind him. He
overthrew also Euthyphron, who exceeded Hylas in beauty,
and Hippolytus in the chase; Pterelas, who had followed Nestor
to the siege of Troy, and was beloved by Achilles for his
prowess and valor; Aristogiton, who, having bathed in the
river Achelo&uuml;s, was said to have received from the deity of the
stream the secret gift of assuming whatever form he desired,
and who had, indeed, a suppleness and agility that eluded the
strongest grasp; but Adrastus, by one stroke of his lance, rendered
him motionless forever, and his soul rushed from the
wound with his blood.</p>

<p>Nestor, who saw the bravest of his commanders fall under
the cruel hand of Adrastus, as ears of corn ripened into a
golden harvest fall before the sickle of the reaper, forgot the
danger to which, tremulous and feeble with age, he exposed
himself in vain. His attention was wholly fixed upon his son
Pisistratus, whom he followed with his eye, as he was bravely

<!-- page 488 -->

sustaining the party that defended his father. But now the
fatal moment had come when Nestor was once more to feel
the infelicity of having lived too long.</p>

<p>Pisistratus made a stroke against Adrastus with his lance, so
violent, that, if the Daunian had not avoided it, it must have
been fatal. The assailant, having missed his blow, staggered
with its force, and before he could recover his position Adrastus
wounded him with a javelin in the belly. His bowels, in a
torrent of blood, followed the weapon; his color faded like a
flower plucked in the meadow by a maiden; his eyes became
dim, and his voice faltered. Alc&aelig;us, his governor, who fought
near him, sustained him as he fell, and had just time to place
him in the arms of his father, before he expired. He looked
up and made an effort to give the last token of his tenderness;
but, having opened his lips to speak, the spirit issued with his
breath.</p>

<p>Nestor, now defended against Adrastus by Philoctetes, who
spread carnage and horror around him, still supported the body
of his son, and pressed it in agony to his bosom. The light
was now hateful to his eyes, and his passion burst out into
exclamation and complaint. "Wretched man," said he, "to
have been once a father, and to have lived so long! Wherefore,
O inexorable Fates! would ye not take my life when I was
chasing the Calydonian boar, sailing in the expedition to Colchis,
or courting danger in the first siege of Troy? I should
then have died with glory, and tasted no bitterness in death.
I now languish with age and sorrow; I am now feeble and
despised; I live only to suffer, and have sensibility only for
affliction. O my son! O my dear son, Pisistratus! when I
lost thy brother Antilochus I had still thee to comfort me, but
I now have thee no more; I possess nothing and can receive
no comfort; with me all is at an end; and even in hope, that
only solace of human misery, I have no portion. O my children!
Antilochus and Pisistratus! I feel as if this day I had
lost you both; the first wound in my heart now bleeds afresh.
Alas! I shall see you no more! Who shall close my eyes
when I die, and who shall collect my ashes for the urn? Thou

<!-- page 489 -->

hast died, O my dear Pisistratus, like thy brother, the death of
a hero; and to die is forbidden only to me!"</p>

<p>In this transport of grief he would have killed himself with
a javelin that he held in his hand, but he was prevented by
those that stood by. The body of his son was forced from his
arms, and sinking under the conflict he fainted. He was carried,
in a state of insensibility, to his tent, where, reviving
soon after, he would have returned to the combat, if he had
not been restrained.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Adrastus and Philoctetes were mutually in
search of each other. Their eyes sparkled like those of the
leopard and the lion, when they fight in the plains that are
watered by the Cayster. Their looks were savage, and expressed
hostile fury and unrelenting vengeance. Every lance
that they dismissed was fatal, and the surrounding warriors
gazed at them with terror. At last they got sight of each
other, and Philoctetes applied one of those dreadful arrows to
his bow, which from his hand never missed the mark, and
which inflicted a wound that no medicine could cure. But
Mars, who favored the fearless cruelty of Adrastus, would not
yet suffer him to perish. It was the pleasure of the god that
he should prolong the horrors of war, and increase the number
of the dead. Adrastus was still necessary to divine justice, for
the punishment of man.</p>

<p>Philoctetes, at the very moment when he was fitting the
shaft against Adrastus, was himself wounded with a lance; the
blow was given by Amphimachus, a young Lucanian, more
beautiful than Nireus, who, among all the commanders at the
siege of Troy, was surpassed in person only by Achilles. Philoctetes,
the moment he received the wound, discharged the
arrow at Amphimachus. The weapon transfixed his heart.
The lustre of his eyes, so beautifully black, was extinguished,
and they were covered with the shades of death. His lips, in
comparison with which the roses that Aurora scattered in the
horizon are pale, lost their color. His countenance, so blooming
and lovely, became ghastly and disfigured.  Philoctetes
himself was touched with compassion.  When his body lay

<!-- page 490 -->

weltering in his blood, and his tresses, which might have been
mistaken for Apollo's, were trailed in the dust, every one
lamented his fall.</p>

<p>Philoctetes, having slain Amphimachus, was himself obliged
to retire from the field; he became feeble by the loss of blood;
and he had exerted himself so much in the battle that his old
wound became painful, and seemed ready to break out afresh,
for, notwithstanding the divine science of the sons of &AElig;sculapius,
the cure was not perfect. Thus exhausted, and ready to
fall upon the heaps of slain that surrounded him, he was borne
off by Archidamas, who excelled in dexterity and courage all
the &OElig;balians that he brought with him to found the city of
Petilia, just at the moment when Adrastus might with ease
have laid him dead at his feet. And now the tyrant found
none that dared to resist him, or retard his victory. All his
enemies had either fallen or fled, and he might justly be compared
to a torrent, which, having overflowed its bounds, rushes
on with tumultuous impetuosity, and sweeps away the harvest
and the flock, the shepherd and the village, together.</p>

<p>Telemachus heard the shouts of the victors at a distance,
and saw his people flying before Adrastus with disorder and
precipitation, like a herd of timid hinds, that, pursued by the
hunter, traverse the plain, rush through the forest, leap the
precipice, and plunge into the flood.</p>

<p>A groan issued from his breast, and his eyes sparkled with
indignation. He quitted the spot where he had long fought
with so much danger and glory, and hastened to sustain his
party. He advanced, covered with the blood of a multitude
whom he had extended in the dust; and in his way he gave a
shout that was at once heard by both armies.</p>

<p>Minerva had communicated a kind of nameless terror to his
voice, which the neighboring mountains returned. The voice
even of Mars was never louder in Thrace, when he called up
the infernal Furies, War and Death. The shout of Telemachus
animated his people with new courage, and chilled his
enemies with fear; Adrastus himself was moved, and blushed
at the confusion he felt.  A thousand fatal presages thrilled

<!-- page 491 -->

him with secret horror, and he was actuated rather by despair
than courage. His trembling knees thrice bent under him,
and he thrice drew back, without knowing what he did; his
countenance faded to a deadly pallor, and a cold sweat covered
his body; his voice became hollow, tremulous, and interrupted;
and a kind of sullen fire gleamed in his eyes, which appeared
to be starting from their sockets. All his motions had the
sudden violence of a convulsion, and he looked like Orestes,
when he was possessed by the Furies. He now began to
believe that there are gods; he fancied that he saw them denouncing
vengeance, and that he heard a hollow voice issuing
from the depths of hell, and calling him to everlasting torment.
Every thing impressed him with a sense that a divine and invisible
hand was raised against him, and that it would crush
him in its descent. Hope was extinguished in his breast, and
his courage fled, as light vanishes when the sun sets in the
deep, and the earth is enveloped in the shades of night.</p>

<p>Adrastus, whose tyranny would already have been too long,
if the earth had not needed so severe a scourge,&mdash;the impious
Adrastus had now filled up the measure of his iniquity, and
his hour was come. He rushed forward to meet his fate:
horror, remorse, consternation, fury, rage, and despair kept
him company. At the first sight of Telemachus, he thought
that Avernus opened at his feet, and the fiery waves of Phlegethon
roared to receive him. He uttered a cry of terror,
and his mouth continued open, but he was unable to speak;
like a man terrified with a frightful dream, who makes an
effort to complain, but can articulate nothing.<sup id="t_ref161"><a href="#t_en161">161</a></sup> He hurled a
lance at Telemachus with tremor and precipitation. Telemachus,
serene and fearless as the friend of heaven, covered
himself with his buckler; victory seemed to overshadow him
with her wings, and suspended a crown over his head; in his
eye there was something that expressed at once courage and
tranquillity; and such was his apparent superiority to danger,
that he might have been taken for Minerva herself. He turned

<!-- page 492 -->

aside the lance that was thrown against him by Adrastus, who
instantly drew his sword, that he might prevent Telemachus
from discharging his lance in return. Telemachus, therefore,
relinquished his spear, and, seeing the sword of Adrastus in his
hand, immediately unsheathed his own.</p>

<p>When the other combatants on each side saw them thus
closely engaged, they laid down their arms, and, fixing their
eyes upon them, waited in silence<sup id="t_ref162"><a href="#t_en162">162</a></sup> for the event that would
determine the war. Their swords flashed like the bolts of
Jove when he thunders from the sky, and their polished
armor resounded with the strokes. They advanced, retired,
stooped, and sprung suddenly up; till at length closing, each
seized his antagonist at the same moment. The clasping ivy
less closely embraces the elm, than these combatants each
other. The strength of Adrastus was undiminished, but that of
Telemachus was not yet mature. Adrastus frequently endeavored
to surprise and stagger him, by a sudden and violent effort,
but without success. He then endeavored to seize the young
Greek's sword; but the moment he relinquished his grasp for
that purpose, Telemachus lifted him from the ground and laid
him at his feet. In this dreadful moment the wretch, who
had so long defied the gods, betrayed an unmanly fear of death.
He was ashamed to beg his life, yet not able to suppress his
desire to live, and endeavored to move Telemachus with compassion.
"O son of Ulysses," said he, "I now acknowledge
that there are gods, and that the gods are just: their righteous
retribution has overtaken me. It is misfortune alone that opens
our eyes to truth: I now see it, and it condemns me. But let an
unhappy prince bring thy father,<sup id="t_ref163"><a href="#t_en163">163</a></sup> now distant from his country,
to thy remembrance, and touch thy breast with compassion."</p>

<p>Telemachus, who kept the tyrant under him with his knee,
and had raised the sword to dispatch him, suspended the blow.
"I fight," said he, "only for victory and for peace; not for

<!-- page 493 -->

vengeance or for blood. Live, then; but live to atone for the
wrongs you have committed; restore the dominions you have
usurped; establish justice and tranquillity upon the coast of
Hesperia, which you have so long polluted by cruelty and
fraud. Live, henceforth, a convert to truth and virtue. Learn
from your defeat that the gods are just; that the wicked are
miserable; that to seek happiness in violence and deceit, is
to insure disappointment; and that there is no enjoyment like
the constant exercise of integrity and virtue. As a pledge of
your sincerity, give us your son Metrodorus, and twelve chiefs
of your nation, for hostages."</p>

<p>Telemachus then suffered Adrastus to rise, and, not suspecting
his insincerity, offered him his hand. But the tyrant, in this
unguarded moment, perfidiously threw a short javelin at him,
which he had hitherto kept concealed. The weapon was so
keen, and thrown with such dexterity and strength, that it
would have pierced the armor of Telemachus, if it had not
been of divine temper. Adrastus, being now without arms,
placed himself for security behind a tree. Telemachus then
cried out: "Bear witness, Daunians, the victory is ours! The
life of your king was mine by conquest, and it is now forfeited
by treachery. He that fears not the gods is afraid of death;
he that fears the gods can fear nothing else."</p>

<p>He advanced hastily towards the Daunians as he spoke,
and made a sign to his people, that were on the other side of
the tree where Adrastus had taken refuge, to cut off his retreat.
The tyrant, perceiving his situation, would have made a
desperate effort to force his way through the Cretans; but
Telemachus rushing upon him, sudden and irresistible as the
bolt which the father of the gods launches from the summit of
Olympus to destroy the guilty, seized him with his victorious
hand and laid him prostrate in the dust, as the northern tempest
levels the harvest not yet ripe for the sickle. The victor
was then deaf to entreaty, though the perfidious tyrant again
attempted to abuse the goodness of his heart: he plunged the
sword in his breast, and dismissed his soul to the flames of
Tartarus, the just punishment of his crimes.</p>

<!-- page 494 -->

<p>As soon as Adrastus was dead, the Daunians, instead of deploring
their defeat and the loss of their chief, rejoiced in
their deliverance, and gave their hands to the allies in token
of peace and reconciliation. Metrodorus, the son of Adrastus,
whom the tyrant had brought up in the principles of dissimulation,
injustice, and cruelty, pusillanimously fled. But a slave
who had been the confidant and companion of his vices, whom
he had enfranchised and loaded with benefits, and to whom,
alone he trusted in his flight, thought only how he might improve
the opportunity to his own advantage: he therefore
attacked him behind as he fled, and having cut off his head,
brought it into the camp of the allies, hoping to receive a
great reward for a crime which would put an end to the war.
The allies, however, were struck with horror at the act, and
put the traitor to death. Telemachus, when he saw the head
of Metrodorus, a youth of great beauty and excellent endowments,
whom the love of pleasure and bad example had corrupted,
could not refrain from tears. "Behold," said he, "what
the poison of prosperity can effect for a young prince! The
greater his elevation, and the keener his sensibility, the more
easy and the more certain is his seduction from virtue. And
what has now happened to Metrodorus, might perhaps have
happened to me, if I had not been favored by the gods with
early misfortune and the counsels of Mentor."</p>

<p>The Daunians being assembled, required, as the only condition
of peace, that they should be permitted to choose a king
of their own nation, whose virtues might remove the disgrace
which Adrastus had brought upon royalty. They were thankful
to the gods who had cut him off; they came in crowds to
kiss the hand of Telemachus as the instrument of divine justice,
and they celebrated their defeat as a triumph. Thus the
power which threatened all Hesperia, and struck united nations
with terror, fell in a moment, totally and forever. So the
ground that is gradually undermined in appearance maintains
its stability: the slow progress of the work below is disregarded
or despised; nothing shakes, nothing is broken, and, in appearance,
nothing is weak; yet the secret support is certainly, though

<!-- page 495 -->

insensibly destroyed, and the moment at last arrives when the
whole falls at once into ruin, and nothing remains but an abyss
in which the surface, and all that covered it, is swallowed up.
Thus an unjust power, an illegal authority, however founded,
is gradually subverted by fraud and cruelty: whatever degree
of prosperity it may reach through fraud, it gradually undermines
itself. It is gazed at with admiration and terror, and
every one trembles before it, till the moment when it sinks
into nothing; it falls by its own weight, and it can rise no
more, for its support is not only removed, but annihilated&mdash;justice
and integrity are wanting, which alone can produce
confidence and love.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 class="center" id="tb16">BOOK XVI.</h2>

<p class="small">The chiefs assemble to deliberate upon the demand of the Daunians, that
one of their own nation may be given them for a king. Nestor, being
inconsolable for the loss of his son, absents himself from the assembly
of the chiefs, where some are of opinion that the conquered lands should
be divided among them, and allot the territory of Arpi to Telemachus.
Telemachus rejects this offer, and convinces the chiefs that it is their
common interest to appoint Polydamas king of the Daunians, and leave
them in possession of their country. He afterwards persuades the
Daunians to bestow Arpi upon Diomedes, who had accidentally landed
upon their coast. Hostilities being now at an end, the allies separate,
and every one returns to his country.</p>

<p>ON the next day the chiefs of the army assembled to give
the Daunians a king. They saw the two camps intermingled
by an amity so sudden and unexpected, and the two armies, as
it were, incorporated into one, with infinite pleasure. Nestor,
indeed, could not be present, for the death of his son was
more than the weakness of age could support. He sunk
under his misfortunes, in the decline of life, as under the
showers of the evening sinks a flower, which was the glory of
the verdant field, when Aurora first gave the day. His eyes
continually overflowed from an inexhaustible source; the lenient
hand of sleep closed them no more, and the soothing
prospects of hope, in which misery itself can rejoice, were cut
off. All food was bitter to his taste, and light was painful to
his eye; he had no wish but to be dismissed from life, and
covered with the veil of eternal darkness. The voice of friendship
soothed and expostulated with him in vain; for even
kindness itself disgusted him, as the richest dainties are disgustful
to the sick. To soft condolence and tender expostulation,
he answered only with groans and sighs.  He was sometimes

<!-- page 497 -->

heard to break out into such passionate exclamations as
these: "O Pisistratus! O my son! thou callest me, and I will
follow thee! thou hast made death welcome, and I have no
wish but once more to behold thee upon the borders of the
Styx!" After such bursts of grief he would pass whole hours
in silence, except that, lifting up his eyes to heaven, groans
would involuntarily escape him.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the princes that were assembled waited
patiently for Telemachus, who still continued near the body of
Pisistratus, burning the richest perfumes, scattering flowers
over it in handfuls,<sup id="t_ref164"><a href="#t_en164">164</a></sup> and shedding bitter tears. "O my dear
companion," said he, "can our first meeting at Pylos, our journey
to Sparta, and our meeting on the coast of Hesperia be
forgotten? How many obligations am I under to thee! how
tenderly did I love thee! and how faithfully was my love
returned! I knew thy valor; it would have rivalled the
greatest heroes of Greece; but, alas! it has destroyed thee.
It has indeed consecrated thy name, but it has impoverished
the world. We have lost the virtues that would have been
equal to those of thy father,&mdash;another Nestor, whose wisdom
and eloquence would in future times have been the pride and
admiration of Greece. That soft persuasion was already upon
thy lips, which, when Nestor speaks, is irresistible; that native
simplicity and truth, that gentle expostulation which soothes
anger into peace, and that authority which equanimity and
wisdom necessarily acquire, were already thy own. To thy
voice every ear was attentive, and every heart was inclined to
approve thy judgment. Thy words, plain and artless, distilled
upon the heart as the dews of heaven distil upon the rising
herbage of the field. In thee, how many blessings within a
few hours did we possess! with thee, how many blessings have
we now lost forever! Pisistratus, whom but yesterday I
clasped to my breast, is now insensible to my friendship, and a
mournful remembrance of him is all that remains. If, instead
of our closing thy eyes, thou hadst closed the eyes of Nestor,

<!-- page 498 -->

the gods would have spared him this sight of anguish and
horror, and he would not have been distinguished among
fathers by unexampled calamity."</p>

<p>After these exclamations of tenderness and pity, Telemachus
ordered the blood to be washed from the wounded side of
Pisistratus, and the body to be laid upon a purple bier. Upon
this bed of death, his head reclined and his countenance pale,
he resembled a young tree, which, having covered the earth
with its shade, and shot up its branches to heaven, is cut down
by the axe with an untimely stroke; it is severed at once from
its root, and from the earth, a prolific mother, that cherishes
her offspring in her bosom. The branches languish, and the
verdure fades; it is no longer self-supported; it falls to the
ground, and its spreading honors, that concealed the sky, are
stretched, withered and sapless, to the dust; it is no more a
tree, but a lifeless trunk; it aspires and is graceful no more.
Thus fallen, and thus changed, Pisistratus was now borne to
the funeral pile, attended by a band of Pylians, moving with
a slow and mournful pace; their arms reversed, and their eyes,
swimming in tears, fixed upon the ground. And now the
flame ascends in ruddy spires to the sky: the body is quickly
consumed, and the ashes deposited in a golden urn. This urn,
as an invaluable treasure, Telemachus, who superintended the
whole, confided to Callimachus, to whom Nestor had once
confided the son whose remains it contained. "Preserve,"
said he, "these mournful but precious relics of one whom you
tenderly loved; preserve them for his father, but do not give
them till he has fortitude enough to ask for them. That
which at one time sharpens sorrow will soothe it at another."</p>

<p>Telemachus, having thus fulfilled the last duties to his friend,
repaired to the assembly of the confederate princes, who, the
moment they saw him, became silent with attention: he
blushed at the deference that was paid him, and could not be
prevailed upon to speak. The acclamations that followed increased
his confusion; he wished to hide himself, and now for
the first time appeared to be irresolute and disconcerted. At
last he entreated as a favor that they would praise him no

<!-- page 499 -->

more: "Not," he said, "because it displeases me, especially
from those who are so well able to distinguish virtue, but
because I am afraid it should please me too much. Praise is
the great corrupter of men; it renders them arrogant, presumptuous,
and vain; it ought alike to be deserved and avoided.
Nothing is so like honest praise as flattery. Tyrants, the
most wicked of all men, are the objects of greatest adulation.
What pleasure can I derive from such tribute? Honest praise,
if I am so happy as to deserve it, will be well paid when 1
am absent. If you believe that I have merit, you must also
believe that I desire to be humble, and am afraid of being
vain. Spare me, then, if you esteem me; and do not praise
me as if you thought praise was delightful to my ear."</p>

<p>Telemachus, having thus expressed the sentiments of his
heart, took no further notice of those who still continued loud
in extravagant encomiums, and his neglect soon put them to
silence. They began to fear that their zeal would displease
him: praise, therefore, was at an end, but admiration increased.
The tenderness which he had shown to Pisistratus, and the
affectionate assiduity with which he had paid the last duties of
a friend, were known by all. The whole army was more
touched with these testimonies of sensibility and benevolence,
than with all the prodigies of wisdom and valor that had distinguished
his character with unrivalled lustre. "He is wise,"
said they to each other, "and he is brave; he is beloved of
the gods; he stands alone, the hero of our age; he is more
than man; but this is only wonderful, this excites no passion
but astonishment. He is, besides, humane; he is good; he is
a faithful and a tender friend; he is compassionate, liberal,
beneficent, and devoted without reserve, to those who merit
his affection. Of his haughtiness, indifference, and ferocity,
nothing remains. His character is now distinguished by useful
and endearing excellence; by qualities that reach the heart,
that melt us with tenderness, that make us not only acknowledge
but feel his virtues, and would prompt us to redeem his
life with our own."</p>

<p>The princes, having thus given vent to their esteem and

<!-- page 500 -->

admiration, proceeded to debate the necessity of giving the
Daunians a king. The greater part of the assembly was of
opinion that the territories of Adrastus should be divided
among them as a conquered country. Telemachus was offered,
as his share, the fertile country of Arpi, where Ceres pours out
her golden treasures, Bacchus presents his delicious fruit, and
the olive, consecrated to Minerva, pays her green tribute twice
a year. "This country," said they, "ought to obliterate Ithaca
from your remembrance, its barren soil, its mean cottages, the
dreary rocks of Dulichium, and the savage forests of Zacynthus.
Think no more of your father, who has certainly been buried
in the deep at the promontory of Caphareus, by the vengeance
of Nauplius and the anger of Neptune; nor of your mother,
who must have yielded to her suitors in your absence; nor of
your country, which the gods have not favored like that which
is now offered to you."</p>

<p>Telemachus heard them patiently, but the rocks of Thessaly
and Thrace are not more deaf and inexorable to the complaints
of despairing love, than the son of Ulysses to these offers. "I
have no wish," said he, "either for luxury or wealth; and why
should I possess a wider extent of country, or command a
greater number of men? I should only be more embarrassed,
and less at liberty. Men of the greatest wisdom and most
moderate desires have found life full of trouble, without taking
upon them the government of others, who are restless and
untractable, injurious, fraudulent, and ungrateful. He that
desires to command others for his own sake, without any view
but to his own power and pleasure and glory, is a tyrant, an
enemy to the gods, and a punishment to men. He who, on
the contrary, governs men with justice and equity, for their
own advantage, is rather their guardian than their lord; his
trouble is inconceivable, and he is far from wishing to increase
it by extending his authority. The shepherd, who does not
riot upon the flesh of his flock, who defends it from the wolf
at the hazard of his life, who leads it to the best pasture, and
watches over it night and day, has no desire to increase the
number of his sheep, or to seize upon those of his neighbor

<!-- page 501 -->

for this would only increase his care, by multiplying its objects.
Though I have never governed, I have learned from the laws,
and from the sages by whom laws have been made, that government
is an anxious and laborious task. I am, therefore,
content with Ithaca, however small, and however poor. If I
can reign there, with fortitude, justice, and piety, I shall have
no need to wish for a larger dominion to increase my glory.
My reign, indeed, may commence but too soon. Heaven
grant that my father, escaping the fury of the waves, may
reign himself to the longest period of human life; and that,
under him, I may learn to subdue my own passions, till I
know how to restrain those of a whole nation."</p>

<p>Telemachus then addressed the assembly in these terms:
"Hear, O ye princes, what your interest makes it my duty to
declare. If you give the Daunians a just king, he will make
them a just people; he will show them the advantage of keeping
their faith unbroken, and of not invading the territories of
their neighbors&mdash;a lesson which, under the impious Adrastus,
they could never learn. From these people, while they are
under the direction of a wise and good prince, you will have
nothing to fear: if you shall give them such a prince, they
will be indebted for him to you; they will be indebted to you
for the peace and prosperity they will enjoy under him: instead
of attacking, they will bless you; both king and people
will be, as it were, the work of your own hands. But, on the
contrary, if you divide their country among you, the mischiefs
I now predict will certainly come to pass: the Daunians,
pushed to desperation, will renew the war; they will fight in
a just cause, the cause of liberty; and the gods, who abhor
tyranny, will fight for them. If the gods take part against
you, first or last you must be confounded, and your prosperity
will be dispelled like a vapor; counsel and wisdom will be withdrawn
from your chiefs, courage from your armies, and plenty
from your country. Your hope will be presumptuous, and
your undertakings rash; you will impose silence upon those
that warn you of your danger; your ruin will be sudden and
irretrievable, and it will then be said: 'Is this the mighty nation

<!-- page 502 -->

that was to give laws to the world? this, that is now vanquished,
pursued, and trampled in the dust? Such is the
desert of the lawless, the haughty, and the cruel; and such is
the righteous retribution of heaven.' Consider, also, that if
you undertake to divide your conquest, you will unite all the
surrounding nations against you: your alliance, which was
formed in defence of the common liberty of Hesperia against
the usurpations of Adrastus, will become odious; and you
will yourselves be justly accused of aspiring at a universal
tyranny.</p>

<p>"But suppose that you should be victorious against the Daunians
and every other people, your success will inevitably be
your ruin. This measure will disunite you: it cannot be
taken without a violation of those very rules by which alone
you can regulate your own pretensions; it will substitute
power for justice, and therefore each of you will make his
power the measure of his claim. Not one of you will have
sufficient authority over the rest to make a peaceable division
of the common property; and thus a new war will commence,
of which your descendants, that are not yet born, will probably
never see the end. Is it not better to sit down in peace,
with justice and moderation, than to follow ambition, where
all is tumult, danger, and calamity? Is not perfect tranquillity
and blameless pleasure, a plentiful country and friendly
neighbors, the glory that is inseparable from justice, and the
authority that must result from an integrity, to which foreign
nations refer their contests for decision, more desirable than
the idle vanity of lawless conquest? I speak, O princes, without
interest; I oppose your opinions because I love you; I tell
you the truth, though I risk your displeasure."</p>

<p>While Telemachus was thus speaking, with a new and irresistible
authority, and the princes were admiring the wisdom
of his counsels in astonishment and suspense, a confused noise
spread through the camp, and came at last to the place where
they were assembled. It was said that a stranger had just
landed, with a company of men in arms; that he was of a
lofty bearing; that every thing about him was heroic; that

<!-- page 503 -->

he appeared to have endured great adversity, and to be superior
to all suffering. The soldiers, who were stationed to
guard the coast, at first prepared to repulse him as an enemy
that was invading their country; upon which he drew his
sword with an air of intrepidity, and declared that, if he was
attacked, he could make good his defence; but that he required
only peace and hospitality. He then held out an olive-branch
as a suppliant; and, desiring to be conducted to those
who commanded that part of the coast, he was accordingly
brought to the royal assembly.</p>

<p>The moment after this intelligence was received, the stranger
entered. His majestic appearance struck the whole assembly
with surprise. He looked like the god of war, when he
calls together his sanguinary bands upon the mountains of
Thrace; and he addressed the princes thus:</p>

<p>"Surely I see the guardians of nations assembled to defend
their country, or distribute justice. Here, then, a man, persecuted
by fortune, may hope to be heard. May the gods
preserve you from the like calamities! I am Diomedes, the
king of &AElig;tolia, who wounded Venus at the siege of Troy.
Her vengeance pursues me whithersoever I fly. Neptune, who
can refuse nothing to the divine daughter of the sea, has given
me up to the fury of the winds and waves; and often have my
ships been broken upon the rocks. Inexorable Venus has left
me no hope of again returning to my kingdom, or clasping my
family to my breast. In the country where I first beheld the
light, I shall behold it no more. From all that is dear to me
I am severed forever. Upon this unknown coast, after all my
shipwrecks, I seek only security and rest. Jupiter himself is
the stranger's titulary god; if, therefore, you have any reverence
for heaven, if you have any feelings of compassion, vouchsafe
me some neglected corner of this vast country, some barren
spot, some untrodden waste, some sandy plain, some craggy
rock, where I may take refuge with my associates in misfortune,
and build a little town, a sad memorial of the country
we have lost. We ask but a small tract of such ground as is
useless to you. We will be peaceful neighbors, and firm allies;

<!-- page 504 -->

we will have no enemy, and no interest, but yours; and
we desire only the liberty of living according to our own
laws."</p>

<p>While Diomedes was speaking, Telemachus kept his eyes
fixed upon him, and all the changes of passion were by turns
expressed in his face. When the hero at first mentioned his
long misfortunes, he thought this majestic stranger might be
his father, and his countenance brightened with hope. The
moment he declared himself to be Diomedes, hope faded like
a flower at the chill blast of the north. When he complained
of inexorable anger and an offended goddess, the heart of Telemachus
was melted by the remembrance of what his father
and himself had suffered from the same cause; the conflict
was, at last, more than he could sustain: bursting into tears of
grief and joy, he threw himself upon the neck of Diomedes,
and embraced him.</p>

<p>"I am," said he, "the son of Ulysses, your associate in the
war, who, when you carried off the horses of Rhesus, was not
idle. The gods have treated him with unrelenting severity, as
they have treated you. If the oracles of Erebus may be believed,
he is still alive; but, alas! he is not alive to me. I
have left Ithaca to seek him, and I have now lost him and my
country forever. Judge from my misfortunes of my compassion
for yours; for misfortune is the parent of pity, and so far
it is an advantage. In this country I am but a stranger myself,
and I have from my infancy suffered various distress in my
own. Yet, O mighty Diomedes, I was not there ignorant of
the glory you have acquired, nor am I here unable, O next to
Achilles in courage and prowess! to procure you some succor.
The princes whom you see in this assembly are not strangers
to humanity; they are sensible that without it there is neither
virtue, nor courage, nor honor. The truly great become more
illustrious by adversity; without adversity, something is wanting
in their character, and they cannot be examples either of
patience or of fortitude. When virtue suffers, every heart is
melted that is not insensible to virtue. Intrust then your affairs
implicitly with us, to whom the gods have given you;

<!-- page 505 -->

we receive you as a bounty from their hands, and shall think
ourselves happy in the power of alleviating your distress."</p>

<p>Diomedes, astonished at what he heard, fixed his eyes upon
Telemachus, and felt himself moved to the heart. They embraced
as if they had been long united by the most intimate
friendship. "O son of the wise Ulysses," said he, "how
worthy art thou of such a father! Thou hast the same sweetness
of countenance, the same grace of discourse, the same
force of eloquence, the same elevation of sentiment, and the
same rectitude of thought."</p>

<p>The hero was also embraced by Philoctetes, and they related
their unfortunate adventures to each other. "You would,
certainly," said Philoctetes, "be glad once more to see Nestor.
He has just lost his last surviving child, Pisistratus; and to
him this world is now only a vale of tears, leading to the
grave. Come with me and comfort him: an unfortunate friend
is more likely than any other to soothe his distress." They
went immediately to his tent, but grief had so much affected
both his senses and his understanding, that he recollected
Diomedes with difficulty. Diomedes at first wept with him,
and the old man felt his grief increased by the interview. The
presence of his friend, however, soothed his anguish by degrees,
and it was easy to perceive that the sense of his misfortunes
was, in some degree, suspended by the pleasure of
relating them, and of hearing what had befallen Diomedes in
return.</p>

<p>In the mean time the assembled princes consulted with
Telemachus what was proper to be done. Telemachus advised
them to bestow the country of Arpi upon Diomedes, and
to give Polydamas to the Daunians for their king. Polydamas
was their countryman, a soldier of whose eminent abilities
Adrastus was jealous, and whom, therefore, he would never
employ, lest he should share the glory of success, which he
wished to secure to himself. Polydamas had often told him
in private, that in a war against united nations, his life and
the public welfare were too much exposed, and would have
persuaded him to treat the neighboring States with more justice

<!-- page 506 -->

and equity. But men who hate truth, hate those also
who are bold enough to speak it; they are not touched either
with their sincerity, their zeal, or their disinterestedness. A
deluded prosperity hardened the heart of Adrastus against the
counsels of virtue, and the neglect of them afforded him every
day a new triumph, for fraud and violence gave him the advantage
over all his enemies. The misfortunes which Polydamas
predicted did not happen. Adrastus despised the timid
prudence which foresaw nothing but difficulty and danger;
Polydamas became at length insupportable; he was dismissed
from all his employments, and left to languish in solitude and
poverty.</p>

<p>Polydamas was at first overwhelmed with this reverse of
fortune; but at length it supplied what was wanting in his
character,&mdash;a sense of the vanity of external greatness. He
became wise at his own expense, and rejoiced that he had felt
adversity; he learnt by degrees not to repine, to live upon
little, to nourish himself with tranquillity upon truth, to cultivate
the virtues of private life, which are infinitely more estimable
than those that glitter in the public eye; finally, not to
depend for his enjoyments upon men. He dwelt in a desert
at the foot of Mount Garganus, where a rock that formed a
kind of rude vault sheltered him from the weather. A brook
that fell from the mountain quenched his thirst, and the fruit
of some neighboring trees allayed his hunger. He had two
slaves whom he employed to cultivate a small spot of ground,
and he assisted them in their work with his own hands. The
soil repaid his labor with usury, and he was in want of nothing.
He had not only fruit, herbs, and roots in abundance,
but fragrant flowers of every kind. In this retirement he deplored
the misfortune of those nations which the mad ambition
of a prince pushes on to their ruin. He expected every
day that the gods, who, though long-suffering, are just, would
put an end to the tyranny of Adrastus. He thought he perceived
that the more the tyrant rose in prosperity, the nearer
he approached to destruction; for successful imprudence, and
absolute authority in its utmost stretch, are to kings and kingdoms

<!-- page 507 -->

the certain forerunners of a fall. Yet when he heard of
the defeat and death of Adrastus, he expressed no joy, either
in having foreseen his ruin, or in being delivered from his
tyranny; he was anxious only for his country, which he feared
the conquerors might reduce to a state of slavery.</p>

<p>Such was the man whom Telemachus proposed to give the
Daunians for their king. He had been some time acquainted
both with his courage and his virtue; for Telemachus, as he had
been advised by Mentor, applied himself with incessant diligence
to discover the good and bad qualities of all persons
who had any considerable trust, whether under the allied
princes with whom he served in the war, or among their enemies.
It was one of his principal employments, in every place,
to discover and examine men who were distinguished by some
singular talent or qualification, wherever they were to be
found.</p>

<p>The confederated princes were at first unwilling to bestow
the kingdom upon Polydamas. "We have learned," said they,
"by fatal experience, that a king of the Daunians, who has a
military disposition and military skill, must be extremely formidable
to his neighbors. Polydamas is a great commander,
and he may bring us into great danger." "It is true," replied
Telemachus, "that Polydamas is acquainted with war; but it
is also true that he is a lover of peace; these two things together
make the very character that our interest requires. A
man who has experienced the difficulties, the dangers, and the
calamities of war, is much better qualified to avoid them than
he that knows them only by report. Polydamas has learned
to relish and to value the blessings of tranquillity; he always
condemned the enterprises of Adrastus, and foresaw the ruin
in which they would terminate. You will have much more to
fear from a weak prince, without knowledge and without experience,
than from one who sees all with his own eye, and
determines all by his own will. The weak and ignorant prince
will see all things with the eyes of another&mdash;either of some
capricious favorite, or of some flattering, turbulent, and ambitious
minister; he will therefore be engaged in a war without

<!-- page 508 -->

intending it. You can certainly have no dependence upon
him who acts implicitly by the direction of others; there can
be no hope that his promises will be kept; and you will, in a
short time, have no alternative but to destroy him, or to suffer
yourselves to be destroyed by him. Is it not, therefore, more
advantageous, more safe, and at the same time more just and
more generous, faithfully to fulfil the trust which the Daunians
have placed in you, and give them a king that is worthy of
dominion?"</p>

<p>All scruples being entirely removed by this discourse, Polydamas
was immediately proposed to the Daunians, who waited
the determination of the assembly with impatience. As soon
as they heard the name of Polydamas, they answered: "The
allies have now proved the sincerity of their intentions, and
given us a pledge of perpetual peace, by proposing a man of
such virtue and abilities for our king. If they had proposed
a man without spirit, without virtue, without knowledge, we
should have concluded that they designed only to make us
weak and contemptible, by rendering our government corrupt&mdash;a
cruel subtlety, which we could not have seen practised
against us without a secret but strong resentment. The choice
of Polydamas, indeed, is a proof of candor. As the allies
have given us a king who is incapable of doing any thing inconsistent
with the liberty and honor of our State, it is manifest
that they expect nothing which can either degrade or
oppress us; and on our part, we call the gods to witness, that
if the rivers return not back to their sources, we will not cease
to love those who have treated us with so noble a beneficence.
May our latest posterity remember the benefits which have this
day been conferred upon us, and renew, from generation to
generation, the peace of the golden age of Hesperia till time
shall be no more!"</p>

<p>Telemachus then proposed to the Daunians, that the plains
of Arpi should be given to Diomedes for the settlement of a
colony. "You will lay this new people," said he, "under an
obligation without expense. You do not occupy the country
in which they will settle, yet they will be indebted for their

<!-- page 509 -->

settlement there to you. Remember that all men should be
united by the bonds of love; that the earth is of an extent
much larger than they can fill; that it is necessary to have
neighbors; and eligible to have such neighbors as are obliged
to you for their settlement. Nor should you be insensible to
the misfortunes of a prince to whom his native country is interdicted
forever. A union between him and Polydamas will
be immediately formed upon mutual principles of rectitude
and benevolence, the only principles upon which any union
can be lasting; you will therefore secure all the blessings of
peace to yourselves, and become so formidable to all the
neighboring States, that none of them will attempt the acquisition
of a greatness and power that would be dangerous to
the rest. As we have given to your country and people a
king that will procure to both the highest degree of prosperity
and honor, let your liberality, at our request, bestow a country
that you do not cultivate upon a king who has an indubitable
claim to your assistance."</p>

<p>The Daunians answered that they could refuse nothing to
Telemachus, who had given them Polydamas for a king, and
they went immediately to seek him in his desert, that they
might place him upon the throne. First, however, they granted
the fertile plains of Arpi to Diomedes, for a new kingdom.
Their bounty to him was extremely pleasing to the allies;
because this colony of Greeks would powerfully assist them to
repel the Daunians, in any future attempt to make encroachments
upon the neighboring States, of which Adrastus had
given them so pernicious an example.</p>

<p>All the purposes of the alliance being now accomplished,
the princes drew off their forces in separate bodies. Telemachus
departed with his Cretans, having first tenderly embraced
his noble friend Diomedes; then Nestor, still inconsolable for
the loss of his son; and last Philoctetes, who possessed and
deserved the arrows of Hercules.</p>

<h2 class="center" id="tb17">BOOK XVII.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus, on his return to Salentum, is surprised to see the country so
well cultivated, and to find so little appearance of magnificence in the
city. Mentor accounts for these alterations, and points out the principal
causes that prevent national prosperity. He proposes the conduct and
government of Idomeneus as a model. Telemachus discovers to Mentor
his desire to marry the daughter of Idomeneus, Antiope. Mentor
approves of the choice, and assures him that she is designed for him by
the gods; but that at present he should think only of returning to
Ithaca, and delivering Penelope from her suitors. Idomeneus, fearing
the departure of his guests, proposes several embarrassing affairs to
Mentor, and assures him that without his assistance they cannot be adjusted.
Mentor lays down general principles for his conduct, but continues
steady in his purpose of departing with Telemachus for Ithaca.
Idomeneus tries another expedient to detain them: he encourages the
passion of Telemachus for Antiope, and engages him and Mentor in a
hunting party with his daughter. She is in the utmost danger from a
wild boar, but is delivered by Telemachus. He feels great reluctance to
leave her, and has not fortitude to bid Idomeneus farewell. Being encouraged
by Mentor, he surmounts his difficulties, and embarks for his
country.</p>

<p>TELEMACHUS was now impatient to rejoin Mentor at Salentum,
and to embark with him for Ithaca, where he hoped his
father would arrive before him. As he approached the city, he
was astonished to see that the neighboring country, which he
had left almost a desert, was now in the highest state of cultivation,
and swarmed like a hive with the children of industry
and labor: this change he imputed to the wisdom of Mentor.
But when he entered the city, and perceived that its appearance
was much less magnificent, and that fewer hands were
employed to furnish the luxuries of life, he was displeased, for
he was naturally fond of elegance and splendor. His displeasure,
however, soon gave way to other sentiments: he saw
Idomeneus and Mentor at a distance coming to meet him.

<!-- page 511 -->

His heart instantly overflowed with tenderness and joy. It was
not, however, without some mixture of anxiety; for, notwithstanding
his success in the expedition against Adrastus, he
doubted whether his conduct, upon the whole, would be approved
by Mentor, and endeavored to read his sentiments in
his eyes as he approached.</p>

<p>Idomeneus embraced Telemachus with the affection of a
parent, and Telemachus, as soon as he was disengaged, threw
himself upon the neck of Mentor, and burst into tears. "I am
satisfied," said Mentor: "you have indeed committed great
faults, but they have acquainted you with your infirmities, and
warned you of self-confidence. More advantage is sometimes
derived from disappointment than from success. Great achievements
frequently produce contemptible vain-glory, and dangerous
presumption; but disappointments from ill-conduct make
the man a censor of himself, and restore the wisdom which
success had taken away. You are not to seek praise from
men, but to offer it with humility to the gods. You have
indeed performed noble exploits, but you must confess that you
were rather the instrument than the agent: were they not
effected by powers communicated from without? and were
they not frequently endangered by your precipitation and imprudence?
Are you not conscious that Minerva exalted you
into a nature superior to your own, and that, only after this
transformation, you became equal to the achievements that
you performed? Minerva suspended your passions, as Neptune
suspends the swelling waves, when he commands the tempest
to be still."</p>

<p>While Idomeneus was gratifying his curiosity by making
various inquiries of the Cretans that had returned from the
war, Telemachus was listening to the wisdom of Mentor. At
length, looking around him with astonishment, he said: "I see
many alterations here, of which I cannot comprehend the
cause: has any misfortune happened to Salentum in my
absence? The magnificence and splendor in which I left it
have disappeared. I see neither silver, nor gold, nor jewels;
the habits of the people are plain, the buildings are smaller

<!-- page 512 -->

and more simple, the arts languish, and the city has become a
desert."</p>

<p>"Have you observed," replied Mentor with a smile, "the
state of the country that lies around it?" "Yes," said Telemachus,
"I perceive that agriculture has become an honorable
profession, and that there is not a field uncultivated." "And
which is best," replied Mentor, "a superb city abounding with
marble, and silver, and gold, with a sterile and neglected country;
or a country in a state of high cultivation and fruitful
as a garden, with a city where sobriety of manners has taken
the place of pomp? A great city, full of artificers, who are
employed only to effeminate the manners, by furnishing the
superfluities of luxury, surrounded by a poor and uncultivated
country, resembles a monster with a head of enormous size, and
a withered, enervated body, without beauty, vigor, or proportion.
The genuine strength and true riches of a kingdom consist
in the number of people, and the plenty of provisions.
An innumerable people now cover the whole territory of Idomeneus,
which they cultivate with unwearied diligence and
assiduity. His dominions may be considered as one town, of
which Salentum is the centre. The people that were wanting
in the fields, and superfluous in the city, we have removed
from the city to the fields. We have also brought in many
foreigners. As the produce of the earth will always be in
proportion to the number of persons that till it, this quiet and
peaceable multitude is a much more valuable acquisition than
a new conquest. We have expelled those arts which divert
the poor from procuring by agriculture the necessaries of life,
and corrupt the wealthy, by giving them the superfluities of
luxury and pride; but we have done no injury to the fine arts,
nor to those who have a true genius for their cultivation.
Idomeneus has thus become much more powerful than he was
when you admired his magnificence. This false splendor, by
dazzling the eye, concealed such weakness and misery as would
in a short time have subverted his empire. He has now a
much greater number of subjects, and he subsists them with
greater facility.  These people, inured to labor and hardship,

<!-- page 513 -->

and set above a fond and effeminate attachment to life, by the
wise institutions of the government under which they live,
are always ready to take the field in defence of the country
which they have cultivated with their own hands; and the
State which you think is in decay, will shortly be the wonder
of Hesperia.</p>

<p>"Remember, O my son, that there are two evils in government
which admit of no remedy,&mdash;an inequitable and despotic
power in the prince, and a luxurious depravity of manners in
the people.</p>

<p>"Princes that have been accustomed to consider their will
only as law, and to give the reins to their passions, may do
any thing; but their power of doing any thing is necessarily
subverted by its own excess; their government is capriciously
administered without maxim or principle; they are universally
feared and flattered; their subjects degenerate into slaves;
and of these slaves the number is perpetually diminishing.
Who shall dare to affront them with truth? Who shall stem
the torrent of destruction? It swells over all bounds; the
wise fly before it, and sigh in secret over the ruins of their
country. Some sudden and violent revolution only can reduce
this enormous power within proper bounds; and by that
which alone can restrain it, it is frequently destroyed. Nothing
is so certain a presage of irremediable destruction, as
authority pushed to excess; it is like a bow that is over-bent,
which, if not relaxed, will suddenly break; and who shall
venture to relax it? This excessive, this fatal but flattering
power, has been once the ruin of Idomeneus; he was dethroned
but not undeceived. Of this power, which, as it is
not intended for mankind, can be assumed only to their ruin,
he would still have been the dupe, if the gods had not sent us
hither for his deliverance; and, after all, events scarcely less
than miracles have been necessary to open his eyes.</p>

<p>"The other almost incurable evil is luxury. As the prince
is corrupted by an excess of power, the people are corrupted
by luxury. It has been said, indeed, that luxury feeds the
poor at the expense of the rich; but certainly the poor may

<!-- page 514 -->

be subsisted by useful employments; if they apply themselves
to multiply the products of the earth, they will be under no
necessity to corrupt the rich by the refinements of luxury. A
deviation from the simplicity of nature is sometimes so general,
that a whole nation considers the most trifling superfluities as
the necessaries of life; these factitious necessaries multiply
every day, and people can no longer subsist without things
which thirty years before had never been in existence. This
luxury is called taste, perfection of the arts, and refinement of
the nation. This vice, which superinduces almost every other,
is cultivated and commended as a virtue. Its contagion
spreads from the prince to the meanest of his people. The
royal family imitate the magnificence of the king; the nobles,
that of the royal family; the middle class, that of the nobles;
and the poor&mdash;for who makes a just estimate of himself?&mdash;would
intrude upon the class above them. All live above
their condition; some from ostentation, and to glory in their
wealth; some from a false shame, and to conceal their poverty.
Even those who discover the mischief of this general folly,
want fortitude to set the examples of reformation. All conditions
are confounded, and the nation is undone. A desire of
gain to support this idle expense, taints by degrees the purest
minds; wealth is the only object of desire, and poverty the
only mark of disgrace. You may have learning, talents, and
virtue; you may diffuse knowledge, you may win battles, save
your country, and sacrifice your interest; and after all, if your
merit is not set off by the glitter of fashionable expense, you
will sink into obscurity and contempt. Even those who are
without money, will not appear to want it; they live at the
same expense as if they had it; they borrow, they cheat, and
practise a thousand scandalous expedients to procure it. But
who shall apply a remedy to these evils? New laws must be
instituted, and the taste and habit of the whole nation must
be changed. Who is equal to such an undertaking, but he
who is at once a philosopher and a prince; who, by the example
of his own moderation, can shame those that are
fond of ostentation and parade, and keep the wise in countenance,

<!-- page 515 -->

who would rejoice to be encouraged in an honest frugality?"</p>

<p>Telemachus, while he listened to this discourse, perceived
the delusions of his mind to vanish, like a man that wakes
from a dream. He was now conscious of truth, and his heart
was transformed to its image, as marble to the idea of the
sculptor, when he gives it the features, the attitude, and the
softness of life. At first he made no reply; but while he recollected
what he had heard, he attentively reviewed the alterations
that had been made in the city.</p>

<p>At length, turning to Mentor, he said: "You have made
Idomeneus one of the wisest princes upon earth; I no longer
know either him or his people. I am now convinced that your
achievements here are much greater than ours in the field.
The success of war is, in a great degree, the effect of personal
prowess and chance, and the commander must always share
the glory of conquest with his men;<sup id="t_ref165"><a href="#t_en165">165</a></sup> but your work is properly
and exclusively your own; you have alone opposed a
whole nation and its prince, and you have corrected the manners
and principles of both. The success of war is always fatal
and horrid: all here is the work of celestial wisdom; all is
gentle, pure, and lovely; all indicates an authority more than
human. When man is desirous of glory, why does he not
seek it by works of benevolence like these? Oh, how false are
their notions of glory, who hope to acquire it by ravaging the
earth, and by destroying mankind!"</p>

<p>At this exclamation of Telemachus, Mentor felt a secret joy,
that brightened in his countenance; for it convinced him that
his pupil had reduced the value of conquest and triumph to
their true standard, at an age when it would have been but
natural to overrate the glory he had acquired.</p>

<p>"It is true," replied Mentor, after a pause, "all that Idomeneus
has done here is right, and deserves commendation; but
he may do still better. He has now brought his passions
under subjection, and applies himself to the government of

<!-- page 516 -->

his people upon just principles; but he has still great faults,
which seem to be the progeny of faults that are past. When
we make an effort to leave familiar vices, they seem to follow
us; bad habits, relaxation of mind, inveterate errors, and strong
prejudices long remain. Happy are those who never deviated
into error! Their rectitude, and theirs only, can be uniform
and constant. The gods, O Telemachus, require more from
you than from Idomeneus; because you have been made acquainted
with truth from your earliest infancy, and have never
been exposed to the seduction of unbounded prosperity.</p>

<p>"Idomeneus," continued Mentor, "is by no means deficient
either in penetration or knowledge; but he wastes his abilities
upon little things; he is too much busied upon parts to comprehend
the whole. The proof of abilities in a king, as the
supreme governor of others, does not consist in doing every
thing himself: to attempt it is a poor ambition; and to suppose
that others will believe it can be done, an idle hope. In
government, the king should not be the body, but the soul;
by his influence, and under his direction, the hands should
operate, and the feet should walk. He should conceive what
is to be done, but he should appoint others to do it. His
abilities will appear in the conception of his designs, and especially
in the choice of his instruments. He should never
stoop to their function, nor suffer them to aspire to his. Neither
should he trust them implicitly; he ought to examine
their proceedings, and be equally able to detect a want of
judgment or integrity. He governs well who discerns the
various characters and abilities of men, and employs them to
administer government under him, in departments that are
exactly suited to their talents. The perfection of supreme
government consists in the governing of those that govern.
He that presides, should try, restrain, and correct them; he
should encourage, raise, change, and displace them; he should
keep them forever under his eye, and in his hand; but, to
make the minute particulars of their subordinate departments
objects of personal application, indicates meanness and suspicion,
and fills the mind with petty anxieties, that leave it neither

<!-- page 517 -->

time nor liberty for designs that are worthy of royal
attention. To form great designs, the mind must be free and
tranquil; no intricacies of business must embarrass or perplex,
no subordinate objects must divide the attention. A mind
that is exhausted upon minute particulars, resembles the lees
of wine, that have neither flavor nor strength. A king that
busies himself in doing the duty of his servants, is always
determined by present appearances, and never extends his
view to futurity; he is always absorbed by the business of the
day that is passing over him; and this being his only object,
it acquires an undue importance, which, if compared with
others, it would lose. The mind that admits but one object
at a time, must naturally contract; and it is impossible to
judge well of any affair, without considering many, comparing
them with each other, and ranging them in a certain order, by
which their relative importance will appear. He that neglects
this rule in government, resembles a musician, who should
content himself with the discovery of melodious tones, one by
one, and never think of combining or harmonizing them into
music, which would not only gratify the ear, but affect the
heart. Or he may be compared to an architect, who should
fancy the powers of his art exhausted, by heaping together
large columns, and great quantities of stone curiously carved,
without considering the proportion of his building, or the arrangement
of his ornaments. Such an artist, when he was
building a saloon, would not reflect that a suitable staircase
should be added; and when he was busy upon the body of
the building, he would forget the court-yard and the portal.
His work would be nothing more than a confused assemblage
of parts, not suited to each other, not concurring to form a
whole. Such a work would be so far from doing him honor,
that it would be a perpetual monument of disgrace. It would
show that his range of thought was not sufficient to include all
the parts of his design at once, that his mind was contracted,
and his genius subordinate, for he that sees only from part to
part, is fit only to execute the designs of another. Be assured,
my dear Telemachus, that the government of a kingdom requires

<!-- page 518 -->

a certain harmony like music, and just proportions like
architecture.</p>

<p>"If you will give me leave to carry on the parallel between
these arts and government, I can easily make you comprehend
the inferiority of those who administer government by parts,
and not as a whole. He that sings particular parts in a concert,
however great his skill or excellent his voice, is still but
a singer; he who regulates all the parts, and conducts the
whole, is the master of music. So, he that fashions the
columns, and carries up the sides of a building, is no more than
a mason; but he who has designed the whole, and whose
mind sees all the relations of part to part, is the architect.
Those, therefore, who are most busy, who dispatch the greatest
number of affairs, can least be said to govern; they are
only the inferior workmen. The presiding mind, the genius
that governs the State, is he who, doing nothing, causes all to
be done; who meditates, contrives, looks forward to the future,
and back to the past; who sees relative proportions, arranges
all things in order, and provides for remote contingencies;
who keeps himself in perpetual exercise to wrestle with fortune,
as the swimmer struggles with a torrent; and whose
mind is night and day upon the stretch, that, anticipating all
events, nothing may be left to chance.</p>

<p>"Do you think, my dear Telemachus, that a great painter
is incessantly toiling that he may dispatch his work with the
greater expedition? No: such drudgery and constraint would
quench all the fire of imagination; he would no longer work
like a genius, for the genius works as he is impelled by the
power of fancy, in sudden, vigorous, but irregular sallies.
Does the genius spend his time in grinding colors and preparing
pencils? No: he leaves that to others who are yet in the
rudiments of his art. He reserves himself for the labors of
the mind; he transfers his ideas to the canvas in bold and
glowing strokes, which give dignity to his figures, and animate
them not only with life but passion. His mind teems with the
thoughts and sentiments of the heroes he is to represent; he
is carried back to the ages in which they lived, and to the circumstances

<!-- page 519 -->

in which they were placed. But with this fervid
enthusiasm he possesses also a judgment that restrains and regulates
it, so that his whole work, however bold and animated, is
perfectly consonant with propriety and truth. And can it be
imagined that less elevation of genius, less effort of thought, is
necessary to make a great king than a good painter? Let us
therefore conclude that the province of a king is to think, to
form great designs, and to make choice of men properly qualified
to carry them into execution."</p>

<p>"I think," said Telemachus, "that I perfectly comprehend
your meaning; but surely a king who leaves the dispatch of
public business to others will be often imposed upon." "You
are mistaken," replied Mentor; "a general knowledge of government
will always secure him against imposition. Those who
are not acquainted with radical principles, and have not
sagacity to discern the talents and characters of men, are
always seeking their way like men in the dark. If these,
indeed, escape imposition, it is by chance, for they have not a
clear and perfect knowledge of what they seek, nor in what
direction they should move to find it; their knowledge is just
sufficient to excite suspicion; and they are rather suspicious of
integrity that opposes them with truth, than of fraud that
seduces them by flattery. Those, on the contrary, who know
the principles of government, and can distinguish the characters
of men, know what is to be expected from them, and how
to obtain it; they know, at least, whether the persons they
employ are, in general, proper instruments to execute their
designs, and whether they conceive and adopt their views
with sufficient precision and abilities to carry them into effect.
Besides, as their attention is not divided by embarrassing particulars,
they keep the great object steadily in view, and can
always judge whether they are approaching it. If they are
sometimes deceived, it is in accidental and trifling matters that
are not essential to the principal design. They are also superior
to little jealousies, which are always marks of a narrow
mind and grovelling disposition; they know that in great
affairs they must in some particulars be deceived, because they

<!-- page 520 -->

are obliged to make use of men, and men are often deceitful.
More is lost by the delay and irresolution which arises from
want of confidence in those who must be employed, than from
petty frauds, by which that confidence is abused. He is comparatively
happy who is disappointed only in affairs of small
moment. The great work may go on with success, and it is
about this only that a great man ought to be solicitous. Fraud,
indeed, should be severely punished when it is discovered, but
he that would not be deceived in matters of importance must
in trifles be content to be deceived. An artificer, in his workroom,
sees every thing with his own eye, and does every thing
with his own hand; but a king who presides over a great
nation can neither see all nor do all. He ought, indeed, to do
nothing himself but what another cannot do under him; and
to see nothing that is not essential to some determination of
great importance.</p>

<p>"You, Telemachus," continued Mentor, "are a favorite of
the gods, and it is their pleasure to distinguish your reign by
wisdom. All that you see here is done less for the glory of
Idomeneus, than for your instruction. If your virtues correspond
with the designs of heaven, the wise institutions that you
admire in Salentum are but as shadows to the substance, in
comparison with what you will one day do in Ithaca. But
Idomeneus has now prepared a ship for our departure, and it
is time that we should think of quitting the coast of Hesperia."</p>

<p>At the mention of their departure, Telemachus opened his
heart to his friend, with respect to an attachment which made
it impossible for him to leave Salentum without regret. The
secret, however, cost him some pain. "You will blame me,
perhaps," said he, "for yielding too easily to impressions of
love, in the countries through which I pass; but my heart
would always reproach me if I should hide from you the passion
that I have conceived for Antiope, the daughter of Idomeneus.
This, my dear Mentor, is not a blind impulse, like that
which you taught me to surmount in the island of Calypso. I
know that the wound which my heart received from Eucharis
was deep; neither time nor absence can efface her image from

<!-- page 521 -->

my heart, and I cannot even now pronounce her name without
emotion. After such experience of my weakness, I must be
diffident of myself. But what I feel for Antiope is wholly different
from what I felt for Eucharis; it is not the tumultuous
desire of passion; it is the calm complacency of reason, a
tender approbation and esteem. I desire her as my friend
and companion for life, and if the gods shall ever restore my
father to me, and I am permitted to choose, my fate and the
fate of Antiope shall be one. The charms that have attached
me to Antiope are the glowing modesty of her countenance,
her silent diffidence and sweet reserve, her constant attention
to tapestry, embroidery, or some other useful and elegant employment,
her diligence in the management of her father's
household since the death of her mother, her contempt of
excessive finery in her dress, and her total forgetfulness, or
rather ignorance, of her beauty. When, at the command of
Idomeneus, she leads the dance, with the beauties of Crete, to
the soft sound of the flute, she might be well taken for Venus,
the queen of smiles, with the Graces<sup id="t_ref166"><a href="#t_en166">166</a></sup> in her train. When he
takes her with him to the chase, she discovers such skill in the
bow, and such dignity of deportment, as distinguish Diana
when she is surrounded by her nymphs. Of this superiority
she alone is ignorant, while every eye remarks it with admiration.
When she enters a temple with sacred offerings to the
god, she might herself be taken for the divinity of the place.
With what devotion and awe she presents her gifts and propitiates
the gods, when some crime is to be expiated, or some
fatal omen averted! And when she appears with a golden
needle in her hand, surrounded by the virgins of her train, we
are tempted to believe that Minerva has descended, in a human
form, to the earth, and is teaching the fine arts to mankind.
She encourages others to diligence by her example; she sweetens
labor, and suspends weariness by the melody of her voice,

<!-- page 522 -->

when she sings the mysterious history of the gods; and she
excels the most exquisite painters in the elegance of her embroidery.
How happy the man whom Hymen shall unite with
her by a gentle band! What can he suffer but her loss?&mdash;what
can he fear but to survive her?</p>

<p>"But I take the gods to witness, my dear Mentor, that I am
ready to depart. I shall love Antiope forever, but she shall
not delay my return to Ithaca a moment. If another shall
possess her, I shall be wretched; yet I will leave her. Although
I know that I may lose her by absence, I will not mention my
love either to her or to her father; for I ought to conceal it in
my bosom from all but you, till Ulysses, again seated upon his
throne, shall permit me to reveal it. Judge, then, my dear
Mentor, how much my attachment to Antiope differs from that
passion for Eucharis, by which you remember both my virtue
and reason to have been overborne."</p>

<p>"I am sensible of this difference," said Mentor. "Antiope
is all gentleness, prudence, and simplicity; her hands do not
despise labor; she looks forward with a provident forecast;
she provides for contingencies; she dispatches pressing affairs
with silent expedition; she is always busy, but never confused,
for every thing is referred to its proper time and place. The
elegant regularity of her father's household is her glory&mdash;a
nobler distinction than youth and beauty. Though the whole
is submitted to her management, and it is her province to
reprove, to deny, to spare, which make almost every woman
hated, she is yet beloved by the whole house; for she discovers
neither passion, nor obstinacy, nor levity, nor caprice, which
are so often blemishes in the sex; a glance of her eye is a
sufficient command, and every one obeys from an unwillingness
to displease her. She gives particular directions with exactness
and precision; she commands nothing that cannot be
executed; there is kindness even in her reproof and she
encourages to amendment while she blames for misconduct.
She is the solace of her father's fatigue and care, and to her
his mind retreats for rest, as a traveller, fainting with heat in
the summer's sun, retreats to the shade of a grove and reposes

<!-- page 523 -->

in luxurious ease upon the downy turf. Antiope is, indeed, a
treasure that would repay the most distant and laborious
search. Her mind, no more than her person, is dishonored by
trifling ornaments; her imagination is lively, but not uncontrolled;
she speaks only when it is improper to refrain, and in
her speech there is an artless grace, a soft but irresistible persuasion.
All listen in silence when she speaks, and she blushes
with confusion; the deference and attention with which she is
heard make it difficult for her modesty not to suppress what
she intended to say.</p>

<p>"We have, indeed, heard her speak but seldom, yet you
once heard her upon an occasion which I am sure you cannot
forget. She was one day sent for by her father, when he was
about to punish one of his slaves with exemplary severity. She
appeared with her head modestly reclined, and her face covered
with a long veil. She spoke, but she said no more than was
just necessary to appease his anger. At first she seemed to
take part in his resentment; she then softened it by insensible
degrees; at last she insinuated an apology for the offender,
and, without wounding the king, by making him feel that he
had been excessively angry, she kindled in his bosom sentiments
of justice and compassion. The tumult of his mind
subsided under an easy but irresistible influence, as the yielding
waves insensibly lose their undulation when hoary Nereus
is soothed into peace by the gentle blandishments of his daughter
Thetis. Thus will the heart of a husband one day respond
to the influence of Antiope, though she assumes no authority,
nor takes advantage of her charms, as the lute now answers to
her touch when she wakes it to the tenderest strains. Antiope
is indeed worthy of your affection, and she is intended for you
by the gods; but though your love for her is justified by
reason, you must wait till she is given you by Ulysses. I
commend you for having concealed your sentiments, and I may
now tell you that if you had made any propositions to Antiope,
they would have been rejected, and you would have forfeited
her esteem. She will enter into no engagement, but leaves
herself wholly to the disposal of her father. He that hopes to

<!-- page 524 -->

be her husband, must reverence the gods and fulfil every duty
to man. I have observed&mdash;and has it not been observed by
you?&mdash;that she is less seen, and that her eyes are more frequently
fixed upon the ground, than before your expedition.
She is not a stranger to any of your achievements in the war;
she is acquainted with your birth and your adventures, and she
knows the endowments which you have received from the gods:
this knowledge has increased her reserve. Let us then depart
for Ithaca; my task will be accomplished when I have assisted
you to find your father, and put you in a condition to obtain a
wife worthy of the golden age. If Antiope, a royal virgin, the
daughter of Idomeneus, king of Salentum, were a keeper of
sheep upon the bleak summit of Mount Algidus, the possession
of Antiope would still be happiness and honor."</p>

<p>Idomeneus, who dreaded the departure of Telemachus and
Mentor, formed many pretences to delay them. He told Mentor
that he could not without his assistance determine a dispute
which had arisen between Diophanes, a priest of Jupiter
Conservator, and Heliodorus, a priest of Apollo, concerning
the omens that were to be drawn from the flight of birds and
the entrails of victims.</p>

<p>"And why," said Mentor, "should you concern yourself
about sacred things? Leave questions of religion to be decided
by the Etrurians, who have preserved the most ancient
oracles by tradition, and who are by inspiration interpreters of
the gods to men. Employ your authority only to suppress
these disputes in the beginning; act with perfect neutrality
while they continue, and content yourself with supporting the
decision when it shall be made. Remember that kings ought
to submit to religion, and not to make it: religion is from the
gods, and above regal authority. If kings concern themselves
with religion, they do not protect it as a divine institution,
but degrade it to a mere instrument of State policy. The
power of kings is so great, and that of others so little, that
religion would be in danger of becoming just what the sovereign
would wish to make it, if he should undertake to determine
any question about its doctrines or duties.  Leave

<!-- page 525 -->

then the decision of these questions implicitly to the friends
of the gods, and exert your authority only against those who
will not conform to their determination when it is made."</p>

<p>Idomeneus then complained of the perplexity he suffered
from the great number of cases between private persons, which
he was pressed, with great importunity, to decide.</p>

<p>"Decide," said Mentor, "all new questions of right, by
which some general maxim of jurisprudence will be established,
or some precedent given for the explanation of laws
already in force; but do not take upon you to determine all
questions of private property; they would overwhelm and embarrass
you by their variety and number; justice would necessarily
be delayed for your single decision, and all subordinate
magistrates would become useless. You would be overwhelmed
and confounded; the regulation of petty affairs
would leave you neither time nor thought for business of importance,
and, after all, petty affairs would not be regulated.
Avoid, therefore, a state of such disadvantage and perplexity;
refer private disputes to subordinate judges, and do nothing
yourself but what others cannot do for you. You will then
fulfil the real duties of a king."</p>

<p>"But," said Idomeneus, "there are many persons of high
birth about me who have followed my fortunes, and lost great
possessions in my service; these persons seek some kind of
recompense for their losses, by obtaining certain young women
of great wealth in marriage: they urge me with incessant importunity
to interpose in their behalf, and a single word from
me would insure them success."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Mentor, "a single word from you would
be sufficient, but that single word would cost you too dear.
Would you deprive fathers and mothers of the liberty and
consolation of choosing their sons-in-law, and, consequently,
their heirs? This surely would reduce them to the severest
and most abject slavery, and make you answerable for all the
domestic evils of your people. Marriage, at the best, is not
the couch of unmingled delight, and why should you scatter
new thorns among the down?  If you have faithful servants

<!-- page 526 -->

to reward, distribute among them some unappropriated lands,
and give them, besides, rank and honors suited to their merits
and condition; if more still is necessary, add to these pecuniary
gratifications from your treasury, and make good the
deficiency by retrenching your expense; but never think of
paying your own debts with the property of others, much less
with property transferred in violation of the most sacred rights,
by giving a daughter in marriage without the consent of her
parents."</p>

<p>This difficulty being removed, Idomeneus immediately proposed
another. "The Sybarites," said he, "complain that
certain districts which we have given, as uncultivated lands,
among the strangers whom we have drawn to Salentum, belong
to them. Must I admit this claim? and shall I not
encourage other nations to make demands upon our territory,
if I do?"</p>

<p>"The Sybarites," said Mentor, "should not be implicitly
believed in their own cause; nor is it just to believe you implicitly
in yours." "Upon whose testimony will you then
depend?" said Idomeneus. "Upon that of neither of the
parties," replied Mentor; "some neighboring nation that cannot
be suspected of partiality to either must determine between
you. The Sipontines are such a nation; they have no interest
that is incompatible with yours."</p>

<p>"But am I obliged," said Idomeneus, "to submit to an
umpire? Am I not a sovereign prince? and is a sovereign
prince to leave the extent of his dominions to the decision of
foreigners?"</p>

<p>"If you resolve to keep the lands in question," answered
Mentor, "you must suppose that your claim is good. If the
Sybarites insist upon a restoration, they must, on their part,
suppose their right to be incontestable. Your opinions being
thus opposite, the difference must either be accommodated by
an umpire mutually chosen, or decided by force of arms:
there is no medium. If you should enter a country inhabited
by people who had neither judge nor magistrate, and among
whom every family assumed a right of determining differences

<!-- page 527 -->

with a neighboring family by violence, would you not
deplore their misfortune, and think with horror of the dreadful
confusion which must arise from every man's being armed
against his fellow? Can you then believe that the gods would
look with less horror upon the earth, of which all the inhabitants
may be considered as one people, if every nation, which
is but a more numerous family, should assume the right of
determining by violence all differences with a neighboring nation?
An individual, who possesses his field as an inheritance
from his ancestors, depends wholly upon the authority of the
laws, and the judgment of the magistrate, for the security of
his property, and would be severely punished, as guilty of sedition,
if he should endeavor to secure by force what was
given him by right. Do you then believe that kings are at
liberty to support their pretensions by violence, without having
first tried what could be done by expedients more consonant
to reason and humanity? Is not justice yet more sacred
and inviolable, as an attribute of kings, when it has whole
nations for its object, than as a private virtue in an individual,
when it relates to a ploughed field? Is he a villain and a
robber who seizes only a few acres, and is he just, is he a hero,
who wrests whole provinces from their possessor? If men are
subject to prejudice, partiality, and error, with respect to the
trifling concerns of property, is it probable that they will be
less influenced by such motives in affairs of State? Should
we rely upon our own judgment where it is most likely to be
biased by passion? and should not error be most dreaded
where its consequences will be most fatal? The mistake of a
prince with respect to his own pretensions is the cause of
ravage, famine, massacres, depravation of manners, the mournful
effects of which may extend to the end of time. A king
knows that he is always surrounded by flatterers; should he
not therefore suppose that upon such occasions he will be flattered?
If he leaves his differences to arbitration, he shows himself
candid, equitable, and dispassionate. He states the reasons
upon which his claim is founded. The umpire is an amicable
mediator, not a rigorous judge.  Though his determinations

<!-- page 528 -->

do not compel implicit obedience, yet the greatest deference
should be paid to them: he does not pronounce sentence like
a judge, from whose authority there is no appeal; but he proposes
expedients, and, by his advice, the parties make mutual
concessions for the preservation of peace. If war is at last
inevitable, notwithstanding the king's utmost endeavors to
avoid it, he will, at least, have secured the testimony of a good
conscience, the esteem of his neighbors, and the protection of
the gods."</p>

<p>Idomeneus felt the force of this reasoning, and consented
that the Sipontines should mediate between him and the
Sybarites.</p>

<p>The king, finding these expedients to prevent the departure
of the two strangers ineffectual, endeavored to detain them by
a stronger tie. He had observed the attachment of Telemachus
for Antiope; and he hoped that, by strengthening this,
he might accomplish his purpose. When he gave an entertainment,
therefore, he frequently commanded his daughter to
sing. She obeyed, from a sense of duty; but it was with such
regret and confusion as made it easy to perceive how much
she suffered by her obedience. Idomeneus went so far as to
intimate his desire that the subject of her song might be the
victory which had been obtained over the Daunians and Adrastus;
but she could not be prevailed upon to sing the praises of
Telemachus: she declined it with modest respect, and her
father thought fit to acquiesce. There was something in her
voice inexpressibly tender and sweet; Telemachus felt all its
power, and his emotion was too great to be concealed. Idomeneus
remarked it with pleasure; but Telemachus appeared
not to perceive his design: he could not quench the sensibility
of passion, but reason precluded its effects. He was no longer
that Telemachus, whom love, the tyrant of the mind, had once
held captive in the island of Calypso. While Antiope sung
he was silent; and, as soon as the song was over, he turned
the conversation to some other subject.</p>

<p>The king, being again disappointed, resolved to give his
daughter the pleasure of a great hunting party.  She declined

<!-- page 529 -->

the sport, and entreated with tears to be left behind; but the
commands of Idomeneus were peremptory, and she was obliged
to obey. She was mounted upon a fiery steed, which, like
those that Castor had trained to war, disdained the ground,
and was impatient of the rein; yet she governed him with
such easy negligence, that he seemed to move by the secret
impulse of her will. A train of virgins followed her with that
ardor which is the distinction and felicity of youth; and she
might have been taken for Diana with her nymphs.<sup id="t_ref167"><a href="#t_en167">167</a></sup> The king
followed her incessantly with his eye; and while he gazed
upon his child he forgot the past misfortunes of his life. She
fixed also the attention of Telemachus, who was more touched
with her modesty than with the graces of her person or her dexterity
in the field.</p>

<p>The dogs gave chase to a wild boar of enormous size, and
furious as that of Calydon. The bristles of his back were
as rigid as iron, and as sharp and long as a dart; his eyes
seemed to sparkle with fire, and to be suffused with blood;<sup id="t_ref168"><a href="#t_en168">168</a></sup>
his breath was heard at a great distance, like the hoarse
murmurs of rebellious winds, when &AElig;olus recalls them to his
cave, that the tempest may cease: his long tusks were crooked
like a sickle, nor could the trees of the forest stand before
them. He gored all the dogs that had courage to approach
him. The boldest hunters that pursued him were afraid to
overtake him.</p>

<p>Antiope, who in the course was swifter than the wind,
came up and attacked him. She threw a javelin at him, which
wounded him in the shoulder. The blood gushed out in a
torrent, and he turned upon his adversary with new fury.
The horse of Antiope, although bold and spirited, shuddered

<!-- page 530 -->

and drew back. The monster then rushed against him, and
the shock was like that of the ponderous engines that overturn
the bulwarks of the strongest city. The horse could not sustain
it, and fell. Antiope was now upon the ground, in a situation
that left her no power to avoid the tusks of the furious
animal whom she had provoked. But Telemachus, whose
attention had been engrossed by her danger, had already dismounted.
With a rapidity scarcely less than that of lightning,
he threw himself between her and the boar that was foaming
to revenge his wound. The prince instantly plunged a hunting
spear into his body, and the horrid monster fell, agonized
with fury, to the ground.</p>

<p>Telemachus cut off the head, which astonished the hunters,
and was still terrible when nearly viewed. He presented it
immediately to Antiope, who blushed, and consulted the eyes
of Idomeneus, to know what she should do. Idomeneus, who
had been terrified at her danger, and was now transported
with joy at her deliverance, made a sign that she should accept
the present. She took it, therefore, saying to Telemachus:
"I receive from you, with gratitude, a more valuable gift; for
I am indebted to you for my life." The moment she had
spoken, she feared she had said too much, and fixed her eyes
upon the ground. Telemachus, who perceived her confusion,
could only reply: "How happy is the son of Ulysses, to have
preserved a life so precious! How much more happy, if he
could unite it with his own!" Antiope made no answer, but
hastily rejoined her young companions, and immediately remounted
her horse.</p>

<p>Idomeneus would immediately have promised his daughter
to Telemachus, but he hoped that, in a state of uncertainty,
his passion would still increase, and that the hope of insuring
his marriage, would prevent his departure from Salentum.
Such were the principles upon which Idomeneus reasoned;
but the gods deride and disappoint the wisdom of men. The
very project that was formed to detain Telemachus, hastened
his departure. The tumult of love, and hope, and fear, which
he now felt in his breast, made him justly distrust his resolution.</p>

<!-- page 531 -->

<p>Mentor labored with double diligence, to revive his desire of
returning to Ithaca; and, the vessel being now ready, he also
pressed Idomeneus to dismiss them. Thus, the life of Telemachus
being every moment regulated by the wisdom of Mentor,
with a view to the consummation of his glory, he was
suffered to remain no longer at any place than was necessary
to exercise his virtues, and add experience to knowledge.</p>

<p>Mentor, as soon as Telemachus arrived, had given orders
that the vessel should be got ready. Idomeneus had seen the
preparations with inexpressible regret; and when he perceived
that the guests, from whom he had derived advantages so
numerous and important, could be detained no longer, he
gave himself up to melancholy and despair. He shut himself
up in the innermost recesses of his palace, and endeavored to
soothe his anguish by venting it in sighs and tears. He forgot
that nature was to be sustained with food, and no interval of
tranquillity was bestowed by sleep. His health gradually declined,
and the secret anxiety of his heart consumed him. He
withered like a stately tree which covers the earth with its
shade, but is gnawed by a worm at the root: the winds in
their fury may have attacked it in vain; the earth may have
nourished it with delight; and it may have been spared, in
reverence, by the axe; but if the latent mischief is not discovered,
it will fade; its leaves, which are its honors, will be scattered
in the dust; and the trunk and branches only, rifted and
sapless, will remain. Such, in appearance, was Idomeneus, the
victim of inconsolable grief.</p>

<p>Telemachus was tenderly affected at his distress, but did not
dare to speak to him. He dreaded the day of departure, and
was always busied in finding pretences for delay; but he was
at length delivered from this state of embarrassment and suspense
by Mentor. "I am glad," said he, "to see this alteration
in your temper. You were, by nature, obdurate and
haughty, sensible only to your own conveniences and interests;
but you are now softened into humanity, and your misfortunes
have taught you to compassionate the sufferings of
others.  Without this sympathy, there can be neither goodness,

<!-- page 532 -->

nor virtue, nor ability to govern; but it must not be
carried to excess, nor suffered to degenerate into feminine
softness. I would myself solicit Idomeneus to dismiss you,
and spare you the embarrassment of so painful a conversation;
but I am unwilling that a false shame and unmanly timidity
should predominate in your breast. You must learn to blend
fortitude and courage with the tenderness and sensibility of
friendship. You should preserve an habitual fear of giving
unnecessary pain; when you are compelled to grieve any man,
you should participate in his sorrow, and make the blow fall
lightly which you cannot avert." "That an inevitable stroke
may be thus lightened," said Telemachus, "is the reason why
I wish that Idomeneus should be acquainted with our departure
rather by you than by myself."</p>

<p>"My dear Telemachus," said Mentor, "you mistake your
motive. You are like all other children of royalty, who expect
that every thing should be managed so as to coincide with
their desires, and that the laws of nature should be subservient
to their will; yet they have not resolution to oppose any
man to his face. They avoid an opposition, not in tenderness
to others, not from a principle of benevolence, that fears to
give pain, but from a regard to their own convenience and
gratification, since they cannot bear to be surrounded with
mournful or discontented countenances. They are touched
with the miseries of men only as with objects disagreeable to
the eye. They will not hear of misfortune because it is a disgustful
subject. Lest their fancy should be offended, they must
be told that all is prosperity and happiness; surrounded with
delights, they will neither see nor hear any thing that may interrupt
their joy. If misconduct is to be reproved, error
detected, importunity repressed, false claims opposed, or factious
turbulence controlled, they will always depute another
for the purpose, rather than declare their own will with that
gentle firmness which enforces obedience without kindling
resentment. They will tamely suffer the most unreasonable
favors to be extorted, and the most important affairs to miscarry,
rather than determine for themselves against the opinion

<!-- page 533 -->

of those who are continually about them. This weakness is
easily discovered, and every one improves it to his advantage;
every request becomes in effect a demand; it is urged with the
most pernicious and troublesome importunity, and is granted
that importunity may be troublesome no more. The first
attempt upon the prince is by flattery: by this, designing parasites
recommend themselves to favor, but they are no sooner
trusted to serve than they aspire to govern: they rule their
lord by the very power they have derived from him; their
bridle is in his mouth, and their yoke upon his shoulders; he
groans under it, and sometimes he makes an effort to throw it
off; this effort is soon remitted, and he bears the yoke to his
grave. He dreads the appearance of being governed, yet
tamely suffers the reality: to be governed is indeed necessary
to such princes; for they resemble the feeble branches of a vine,
which, not being able to support themselves, always creep
around the trunk of some neighboring tree.</p>

<p>"I must not suffer you, O Telemachus, to fall into this state
of imbecility, which cannot fail to render you wholly unfit for
command. Though you dare not speak to Idomeneus, lest
you should wound his sensibility, you will yet have no sense of
your affliction when the gates of Salentum are behind you;
you are even now less melted by his grief than embarrassed by
his presence. Go, then, and speak to him for yourself; learn,
upon this occasion, to unite the tender and the firm; let him
see that you leave him with regret, but that you are determined
to leave him."</p>

<p>Telemachus did not dare to oppose Mentor, nor yet to seek
Idomeneus; he was ashamed of his timidity, and yet unable to
surmount it; he hesitated, he went forward a few steps, and
then returned to Mentor, with some new pretence for delay.
He was about to speak, but the very look of Mentor deprived
him of the power, and silently confuted all that he would have
said. "Is this, then," said Mentor, with a smile of disdain,
"the conqueror of the Daunians, the deliverer of Hesperia? Is
this the son of the wise Ulysses, who is to succeed him as the
oracle of Greece? and does he not dare to tell Idomeneus that

<!-- page 534 -->

he can no longer delay his return to his country, where he
hopes once more to embrace his father? O wretched Ithaca!
how great will be thy misfortune if thou art one day to be
governed by a prince who is himself a slave to an unworthy
shame; and who, to gratify his weakness in the lightest trifle,
will sacrifice the most important interest! Remark now the
difference between the sedate fortitude of the closet, and the
tumultuous courage of the field: you feared not the arms of
Adrastus, yet are intimidated by the grief of Idomeneus. This
inequality often brings dishonor upon those princes who have
been distinguished by the noblest achievements; after they
have appeared heroes in battle, they have been found less than
men in common occurrences, in which others have been consistent
and steady."</p>

<p>Telemachus, feeling the force of these truths, and stung with
the reproach they contained, turned abruptly away, and debated
no longer even with himself. But when he approached
the place where Idomeneus was sitting pale and languishing,
his eyes fixed upon the ground, and his heart overwhelmed
with sorrow, they became in a moment afraid of each other;
they did not dare to interchange a look. Their thoughts were
mutually known, without language; each dreaded that the
other should break silence; and in this painful suspense both
burst into tears. At length Idomeneus, pressed by excess of
anguish, cried out: "Why should we seek virtue, since those
who find her are thus wretched? I am made sensible of my
weakness, and then abandoned to its effects. Be it so; and
let the past calamities of my life return. I will hear no more
of good government; I know not the art, and am weary of
the labor. But as for you, Telemachus, whither would you
go? To seek your father is in vain, for among the living he
is not to be found. Ithaca is in possession of your enemies,
who will destroy you if you return, and one of whom is now
certainly the husband of your mother. Be content, therefore,
to continue at Salentum; my daughter shall be your wife, and
my kingdom your inheritance. Your power here, even while
I live, shall be absolute; and my confidence in you without

<!-- page 535 -->

limits. If these advantages are unworthy of your acceptance,
at least leave me Mentor, who is my last resource. Speak&mdash;answer
me; let not your heart be steeled against me, nor deny
your pity to the most unfortunate of men. Alas! you are still
silent. The gods are still inexorable; I feel more sensibly
their resentment at Salentum than at Crete; and the loss of
Telemachus wounds me deeper than the death of my son."</p>

<p>Telemachus replied, in a timid and faltering tone: "My departure
from Salentum is not choice, but fate. I am commanded
to Ithaca by the gods; their wisdom is communicated
to Mentor, and Mentor has urged my departure in their name.
What then can I do? Should I renounce my father, my
mother, and my country, that should be yet dearer than both?
As I am born to royalty, a life of ease and pleasure must not
be my portion, nor must inclination be my guide. With your
kingdom, I should possess more wealth and power than my
father's can bestow; but I ought to prefer what the gods
have decreed me, to what your bounty has offered in its stead.
If Antiope was my wife, I should think myself too happy to
desire your kingdom; but that I may deserve Antiope, I must
go whither I am called by duty, and she must be demanded for
me by my father. Did you not promise to send me back to
Ithaca? Was it not under this promise that I marched against
your enemy Adrastus, with the army of the allies? It is now
time that I should attend to my own interest, and endeavor to
redress the misfortunes of my family. The gods, who have
given me to Mentor, have also given Mentor to the son of
Ulysses, that, guided by his wisdom, he might fulfil their purpose.
Would you, then, have me lose Mentor, when all but
Mentor is lost already? I have now no worldly goods, no retreat,
no father, no mother, no certain country. One man,
distinguished for virtue and for wisdom, is all that remains;
and this, indeed, is the most valuable gift of Jove: judge,
then, if I can renounce this bounty, and consent to be totally
destitute and forlorn. I would cease to be, rather than be
thus: life itself is of less value than a friend; take my life
therefore, but leave me Mentor!"</p>

<!-- page 536 -->

<p>While Telemachus was speaking, his voice became stronger
and his timidity vanished. Idomeneus could not acquiesce,
though he knew not what to reply. Being unable to speak,
he endeavored to excite pity by looks and gestures of distress.
At this moment he perceived Mentor, who said to him in a
solemn tone, but without severity:</p>

<p>"Do not give way to unreasonable sorrow. We leave you;
but we leave you to that wisdom which presides in the councils
of the gods. Remember with gratitude that we were sent by
the direction of that wisdom to correct your errors and preserve
your State. We have restored Philocles, and he will
serve you with fidelity: reverence for the gods, delight in
virtue, love for the people, and compassion for the wretched,
will be always predominant in his bosom. Listen to his advice,
and employ him without jealousy or distrust. The most
important service he can render you, is to tell you your faults
without disguise or palliation. A good king is distinguished by
the noblest fortitude; he fears not the monitor in the friend,
nor shrinks from the sight of his own failings. If you are
endowed with this fortitude, you have nothing to fear from out
absence; the felicity of your life is secure: but if flattery,
which steals its winding way like a serpent, should once more
get access to your heart, and render you suspicious of disinterested
counsel, you are undone. Pine no longer in voluntary
subjection to sorrow, but follow virtue with the utmost effort
of your mind. I have instructed Philocles to lighten your
cares, and deserve your confidence; and I will be answerable
for his integrity. The gods have given him to you, as they
have given me to Telemachus. The destiny which they have
allotted us, we should fulfil boldly; for to regret it is in vain.
If my assistance should be necessary, after I have restored
Telemachus to his father and his country, I will return; and
what could give me more sensible delight? I seek, for myself,
neither wealth nor power; and I wish only to assist others
in the search of justice and virtue. To you, I have a particular
attachment, for the generous confidence of your friendship
can never be forgotten."</p>

<!-- page 537 -->

<p>While Mentor was speaking, Idomeneus became conscious
of a sudden and pleasing change. He felt his passions subside
into peace, as the waves sink to rest, and the tempest is hushed
to silence, when the father of the deep lifts his trident against
them. Nothing now remained but a kind of tender regret&mdash;something
that was rather a soft and soothing melancholy
than grief. Courage, hope, virtue, and confidence in the gods,
began once more to kindle in his bosom.</p>

<p>"Well then, my dear Mentor," said he, "I must lose all,
and be content; let me, however, be still present to your mind.
When you shall have arrived in Ithaca, where the reward of
wisdom shall fill all your wishes, remember that Salentum is
your own work; and that Idomeneus, inconsolable for your
loss, has no hope but in your return. Farewell, O son of
Ulysses! my ports shall detain you no longer; the gods reclaim
the treasure which they have lent, and it is my duty to comply.
Farewell, Mentor, the greatest and wisest of men (if
such excellence as thine is within the limits of our nature, and
thou art not a divinity that has assumed the form to call
strength from weakness, and from simplicity wisdom); be still
the guide and guardian of Telemachus, who is more fortunate
to be thy charge than to be the conqueror of Adrastus. I
dismiss you both: I will restrain my words; my sighs are involuntary,
and may therefore be forgiven. Go, live together,
and together be happy; I have nothing left but the remembrance
that I once shared your felicity. The golden moments
are past, and I knew not their value; they fled in haste, alas!
and they will never return! I have possessed you; but the
joy is vanished! I now see you, but I shall see you no
more!"</p>

<p>Mentor took this opportunity to withdraw; he embraced
Philocles, who burst into tears and was unable to speak.
Telemachus would have taken hold of Mentor's hand, that he
might quit that of Idomeneus; but Idomeneus, placing himself
between them, went towards the port: he gazed upon
them by turns; he sighed; and frequently began to speak;
but his voice faltered, and he left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<!-- page 538 -->

<p>And now they heard, in a confused murmur, the voices of
the mariners that crowded the shore; the cordage was
stretched, the sails were set, and a favorable wind sprung up.
Telemachus and Mentor, with tears in their eyes, took leave
of the king, who held them long in his arms, and followed
them with his eyes as far as they could be seen.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 class="center" id="tb18">BOOK XVIII.</h2>

<p class="small">Telemachus, during the voyage, prevails upon Mentor to explain many difficulties
in the art of government, particularly that of distinguishing the
characters of men, so as to employ the good, and avoid being deceived
by the bad. During this conversation, a calm obliges them to put into a
little island where Ulysses had just gone ashore. Telemachus sees and
speaks to him without knowing who he is; but, after having seen him
embark, feels a secret uneasiness, of which he cannot imagine the cause.
Mentor explains it, and comforts him, assuring him that he shall soon
meet with his father again. He puts his patience and piety to another
trial, by detaining him to sacrifice to Minerva. Finally, the goddess,
who had been concealed under the figure of Mentor, resumes her own
form, and is known and acknowledged by Telemachus. She gives him
her last instructions, and disappears. Telemachus arrives in Ithaca, and
finds his father at the house of his faithful servant Eumenes.</p>

<p>THE sails now swell with the breeze, the anchor is weighed,
and the shore seems to retreat. The experienced pilot perceives
at a distance the promontory of Leucate, which conceals
its summit in the hoary mists that are blown around it by the
freezing whirlwind, and the Acroceraunian mountains, which
still lift their presumptuous brow to heaven, though blasted so
often by the bolts of Jove.</p>

<p>"I believe," said Telemachus to Mentor, during the voyage,
"that I now perfectly understand the maxims of government
that you have given me. They appear, at first, like the confused
images of a dream; but, by degrees, they become clear
and distinct,&mdash;as all objects appear obscure and cloudy at the
first dawn of the morning, but at length rise gradually, like a
new creation out of chaos, as the light, increasing by insensible
degrees, gives them their true forms and natural colors. I
am persuaded that the great secret of government is to distinguish
the different characters of men, to select them for different
purposes, and allot to each the employment which is most

<!-- page 540 -->

suited to his talents; but I am still to learn how characters are
thus to be distinguished."</p>

<p>"Men," replied Mentor, "to be known, must be studied, and
to be studied they must frequently be seen and talked to.
Kings ought to converse with their subjects, hear their sentiments,
and consult them; they should also trust them with
some small employment, and see how they discharge it, in
order to judge whether they are capable of more important
service. By what means, my dear Telemachus, did you acquire,
in Ithaca, your knowledge of horses? Was it not by
seeing them frequently, and by conversing with persons of experience
concerning their excellences and defects? In the
same manner, converse with the wise and good, who have
grown old in the study of human nature, concerning the
defects and excellences of men; you will thus, insensibly,
acquire a nice discernment of character, and know what may
be expected from every man that falls under your observation.
How have you been taught to distinguish the poet from the
mere writer of verses, but by frequent reading, and conversation
with persons who have a good taste for poetry? And
how have you acquired judgment in music, but by the same
application to the subject? How is it possible that men should
be well governed, if they are not known? and how can the
knowledge of men be acquired, but by living among them?
But seeing them in public, where they talk of indifferent subjects,
and say nothing that has not been premeditated, is by no
means living among them. They must be seen in private,
their latent sentiments must be traced to the secret recesses of
the heart, they must be viewed in every light, they must be
sounded, and their principles of action ascertained. But to
form a right judgment of men, it is principally necessary to
know what they ought to be; a clear and definite idea of real
merit is absolutely necessary to distinguish those who have it
from those who have it not.</p>

<p>"Men are continually talking of virtue and merit, but there
are few who know precisely what is meant by either. They
are splendid terms, indeed, but, to the greater part of those

<!-- page 541 -->

who take a pride in perpetually repeating them, of uncertain
signification. Justice, reason, and virtue, must be resolved
into some certain principles before it can be determined who
are just, reasonable, and virtuous. The maxims of a wise and
good administration must be known, before those who adopt
them can be distinguished from those who substitute false refinement
and political cunning in their stead. To take the
dimensions of different bodies, we must have a standard measure;
to judge of qualities and characters, we must have some
fixed and invariable principles to which they may be referred.
We must know precisely what is the great purpose of human
life, and to what end the government of mankind should be
directed. The sole end of all government is to render mankind
virtuous and happy; and with this great end, the notion that
a prince is invested with the regal power and authority for his
own sake, is wholly incompatible. This notion can only gratify
the pride of a tyrant; a good king lives but for his people,
and sacrifices his own ease and pleasure to their advantage.
He whose eye is not invariably fixed upon this great end&mdash;the
public good, if in any instance he attains it, will attain it by
chance; he will float in the stream of time, like a ship in the
ocean, without a pilot, the stars unobserved, and the shores
unknown. In such a situation, is it possible to avoid shipwreck?</p>

<p>"It frequently happens that princes, not knowing in what
virtue consists, know not what they ought to seek in men.
They mistake virtue for austerity; it offends them by appearing
to want complacency, and to affect independence; and,
touched at once with fear and disgust, they turn from it to
flattery. From this moment sincerity and virtue are to be
found no more; the prince is seduced by a phantom of false
glory, which renders him unworthy of the true. He persuades
himself that there is no such thing as virtue upon the earth;
for, though the good can distinguish the wicked, the wicked
cannot distinguish the good, and what they cannot distinguish
they suppose not to exist. They know enough to render them
suspicious; but not knowing more, they suspect all alike; they

<!-- page 542 -->

retire from the public eye, and immure themselves in the
palace; they impute the most casual trifles to craft and design;
they are a terror to men, and men a terror to them. They
love darkness, and disguise their character, which, however, is
perfectly known; for the malignant curiosity of their subjects
penetrates every veil, and investigates every secret. But he
that is thus known by all, knows nobody. The self-interested
who surround him, rejoice to perceive that he is inaccessible. A
prince that is inaccessible to men, is inaccessible to truth: those
who avail themselves of his blindness, are busy to calumniate
or to banish from his presence all who would open his eyes.
He lives in a kind of savage and unsocial magnificence, always
the dupe of that imposition which he at once dreads and deserves.
He that converses only with a small number, almost
necessarily adopts their passions and their prejudices, and from
passions and prejudices the best are not free. He must also
receive his knowledge by report, and therefore lie at the
mercy of tale-bearers, a despicable and detestable race, who
are nourished by the poison that destroys others; who make
what is little great, and what is blameless criminal; who, rather
than not impute evil, invent it; and who, to answer their own
purposes, play upon the causeless suspicion and unworthy curiosity
of a weak and jealous prince.</p>

"Let the great object of your knowledge, therefore, O my
dear Telemachus, be men. Examine them; hear one man's
opinion of another; try them by degrees; trust yourself implicitly
to none. Profit by your experience, when you shall
have been deceived in your judgment, which sometimes will
certainly happen; for wicked men disguise themselves with
too much art to be always detected. Form your opinion of
others, therefore, with caution; do not hastily determine either
that they are bad or good; for, in either case, a mistake may
be dangerous: thus even from error you will derive wisdom.
When you find a man of virtue and abilities, do not use him
only, but trust him; for such men like to have others appear
sensible of their merit, and set a much higher value upon confidence
and esteem than upon pecuniary rewards. But do not

<!-- page 543 -->

endanger their virtue by trusting them with absolute power;
for many men who have stood firm against common temptations,
have fallen when unlimited authority and boundless
wealth have brought their virtue to a severe test. The prince
who shall be so far favored of the gods as to find two or three
whose wisdom and virtue render them worthy of his friendship,
will, by their means, find others of the same character to
fill the inferior departments of State. Thus, by the few that
he can trust, he will acquire the knowledge of others whom
his own eye could never reach."</p>

<p>"But I have often heard," said Telemachus, "that men of
ability should be employed, even though virtue be wanting."
"The service of such men," replied Mentor, "is sometimes
necessary. When a nation is in a state of tumult and disorder,
authority is often found in the hands of wicked and designing
men, who are possessed of important employments, from which
they cannot immediately be removed, and have acquired the
confidence of persons in power, who must not abruptly be opposed;
nor must they be abruptly opposed themselves, lest
they should throw all things into irremediable confusion. They
must be employed for a time, but care must constantly be
taken to lessen their importance by degrees; and even while
they are employed, they must not be trusted. He that trusts
them with a secret, invests them with power which they will
certainly abuse, and of which from that moment he will be
the slave. By his secret, as with a chain, he will be led about
at pleasure; and, however he may regret his bondage, he will
find it impossible to be free. Let them negotiate superficial
affairs, and be treated with attention and kindness; let them
be attached to their duty, even by their passions, for by their
passions only they can be held; but let them never be admitted
to secret and important deliberations. Some spring
should be always ready to put them in motion when it is fit
they should act; but a king should never trust them with the
key, either of his bosom or his State. When the public commotion
subsides, and government is regularly administered by
men of approved integrity and wisdom, the wicked, whose

<!-- page 544 -->

services were forced upon their prince for a time, will insensibly
become unnecessary and insignificant. But even they
should be well treated, for to be ungrateful even to the wicked,
is to be like them; but all kindness shown to such characters
should be with a view to their amendment. Some of their
faults should be overlooked as incident to human infirmity; but
the king's authority should be gradually resumed, and those
mischiefs prevented, which they would openly perpetrate if not
restrained. It must, however, be confessed, that, after all, the
necessity of using wicked men as instruments of doing good,
is a misfortune; and though it is sometimes inevitable, it should
be remedied as soon as possible. A wise prince, who has no
wish but to establish order and administer justice, will soon
find honest men of sufficient ability to effect his purposes, and
be able to shake off the fraudulent and crafty, whose characters
disgrace the best service they can perform.</p>

<p>"But it is not enough for a king to find good subjects; he
must make them." "That," said Telemachus, "must surely
be an arduous task." "Not at all," replied Mentor; "the very
search after virtue and abilities will produce them, for rewards
well bestowed will excite universal emulation. How
many languish in idleness and obscurity who would become
distinguished, if the hope of fortune were to excite them to
labor! How many, despairing to rise by virtue, endeavor to
surmount the distresses of poverty by crime! If you distinguish
genius and virtue by rewards and honors, your subjects
will excel in both characters by a voluntary and vigorous effort
of their own; and how much further may you carry this excellence
by gradually bringing forward the merit that is thus
produced, and advancing those that appear capable of public
and important service, from the lowest to the highest employments!
You will exercise their various talents, and bring the
extent of their understanding and the sincerity of their virtue
to the test. Those who fill the great offices of State, will
then have been brought up under your own eye in lower
stations. You will have followed them through life, step
by step; and you will judge of them, not from their professions,

<!-- page 545 -->

nor from a single act, but from the whole tenor of their
conduct."</p>

<p>While Mentor and Telemachus were engaged in this conversation,
they perceived a Ph&aelig;acian vessel which had put into
a little island wholly desolate, and surrounded by craggy precipices
of an enormous height. It was at this time a dead calm,
so that the zephyrs themselves seemed to hold their breath;
the whole surface of the sea was bright and smooth as a mirror;
the sails which clung to the mast could no longer impel the
vessel in its course, and the rowers, exhausted with labor, endeavored
to supply the deficiency of the gale in vain. It became,
therefore, absolutely necessary to go on shore at this
place, which was rather a rock of the sea than a habitation
for men. At another time it could not have been approached
without the utmost danger.</p>

<p>The Ph&aelig;acians, who were waiting for a wind, were not less
impatient of delay than the mariners of Salentum. As soon as
Telemachus was on shore, he advanced over the crags towards
some of these people who had landed before him, and inquired
of the first man he met whether he had seen Ulysses, the king
of Ithaca, at the palace of Alcino&uuml;s.</p>

<p>It happened that the person to whom he addressed himself
was not a Ph&aelig;acian, but a stranger, whose country was unknown.
He had an air of majesty, but appeared sorrowful
and dejected. When he was accosted, he was lost in thought,
and seemed not to hear the question that was asked him; but,
soon recollecting himself he replied: "You suppose that
Ulysses has been seen in the island of the Ph&aelig;acians, and you
are not mistaken; he was received at the palace of Alcino&uuml;s,
as at a place where the gods are reverenced and the duties of
hospitality fulfilled; but he soon after left that country, where
you will now seek him in vain. He set out, that he might
once more salute his household gods in Ithaca, if ever the
superior powers should forget their anger and vouchsafe the
blessing."</p>

<p>The stranger pronounced these words in a mournful voice,
and immediately rushed into a wild thicket upon the top of a

<!-- page 546 -->

rock, where, fixing his eyes upon the sea, he seemed desirous
of solitude and impatient to depart.</p>

<p>Telemachus remarked him with great attention, and the
more he gazed the greater were his emotion and astonishment.
"The answer of this stranger," said he to Mentor, "is that of a
man so absorbed in affliction as scarcely to take cognizance of
external objects. The unfortunate have my pity, for I am myself
unfortunate, and for this man I am particularly interested,
without knowing why. He has not treated me with courtesy;
he seemed to pay no attention to what I said, and he scarcely
vouchsafed me an answer, yet I cannot but wish that his misfortunes
were at an end."</p>

<p>"See, then," said Mentor with a smile, "what advantage is
derived from the calamities of life; they humble the pride of
greatness, and soften insensibility to compassion. Princes who
have been fatally flattered with perpetual prosperity, imagine
themselves to be gods; if they have an idle wish to be gratified,
they expect mountains to sink and seas to vanish; they
hold mankind as nothing, and would have all nature the mere
instrument of their will. When they hear of misfortune, they
scarcely understand the term; with respect to them misfortune
is a dream, and they know not the difference between good
and evil. Affliction only can teach them pity, and give them,
for the adamant in their bosom, the heart of a man. When
they are afflicted, they become sensible that they have a
common nature with others, to whom they should administer
the comfort of which they feel the want. If a stranger has thus
forcibly excited your pity, because, like you, he is a wanderer
upon the coast, how much more compassion should you feel
for the people of Ithaca, if hereafter you should see them
suffer&mdash;the people whom the gods will confide to your care,
as a flock is confided to a shepherd&mdash;who may perhaps
become wretched by your ambition, your prodigality, or imprudence;
for nations are never wretched but by the fault of
kings, who, like their guardian gods, should watch over them
for good."</p>

<p>To this discourse of Mentor, Telemachus listened with grief

<!-- page 547 -->

and trouble, and at length, with some emotion, replied: "If
these things are true, royalty is, of all conditions, the most
wretched. A king is the slave of those whom he appears to
command; his people are not subordinate to him, but he is
subordinate to his people; all his powers and faculties are
referred to them, as their object; he is the servant, not only of
the community, but of every individual; he must supply all
their wants, accommodate himself to all their weaknesses, correct
their vices, teach them wisdom, and afford them happiness.
The authority with which he appears to be invested, is not his
own; he is not at liberty to exert it, either for his glory or his
pleasure; it is, indeed, the authority of the laws, to which he
must himself be obedient, as an example to others. The laws
must reign, and of their sovereignty he must be the defence;
for them he must pass the night in vigils, and the day in labor:
he is less at liberty and at rest than any other in his dominions,
for his own freedom and repose are sacrificed to the freedom
and happiness of the public."</p>

<p>"It is true," replied Mentor, "that a king is invested with
authority only that he may be, to his people, what a shepherd
is to his flock, or a father to his family; but can you imagine,
my dear Telemachus, that a king who is continually employed
to make multitudes happy can himself be wretched? He
corrects the wicked by punishments; he encourages the good
by rewards; he forms the world to virtue, as a visible divinity,
the vicegerent of heaven. Is it not sufficient glory to secure
the laws from violation? To affect being above their authority,
is not to acquire glory, but to become the object of detestation
and contempt. A king, if he is wicked, must indeed be miserable,
for his passions and his vanity will keep him in perpetual
tumult; but, if he is good, he will enjoy the purest and most
sublime of all pleasures, in promoting the cause of virtue, and
expecting an eternal recompense from the gods."</p>

<p>Telemachus, whose mind was in great uneasiness and agitation,
seemed, at this time, never to have comprehended these
principles, though they had long been familiar to his mind, and
he had often taught them to others. A splenetic humor, the

frequent concomitant of secret infelicity, disposed him, contrary
to his own sentiments, to reject the truths which Mentor had
explained, with subtle cavils and pertinacious contradiction.
Among other objections, he urged the ingratitude of mankind.
"What!" he exclaimed, "shall life be devoted to obtain the
love of those who will, perhaps, hate you for the attempt, and
to confer benefits upon wretches who may probably use them
to your destruction?"</p>

<p>"Ingratitude," replied Mentor, with great calmness, "must
be expected from mankind; but, though mankind are ungrateful,
we should not be weary of doing good; we should serve
them less for their own sakes, than in obedience to the gods
who command it. The good that we do is never lost; if men
forget it, it is remembered and rewarded by the gods. Besides,
if the multitude are ungrateful, there will always be virtuous
men, by whom virtue will be regarded with reverence and love.
Even the multitude, however inconstant and capricious, will,
sooner or later, be just to real virtue.</p>

<p>"But, if you would prevent the ingratitude of mankind, do
not load them with such benefits as, in the common estimation,
are of most value; do not endeavor to make them powerful
and rich; do not make them the dread or the envy of others,
either by their prowess or their pleasures. This glory, this
abundance, these delights will corrupt them; they will become
more wicked, and consequently more ungrateful. Instead,
therefore, of offering them a fatal gift, a delicious poison,
endeavor to improve their morals, to inspire them with justice,
sincerity, fear of the gods, humanity, fidelity, moderation, and
disinterestedness. By implanting goodness, you will eradicate
ingratitude. When you give virtue, you give a permanent and
substantial good. Virtue will always attach those who receive
it to the giver. Thus, by communicating real benefits, you
will receive real benefit in return. The very nature of your
gift will make ingratitude impossible. Is it strange that men
should be ungrateful to princes, who have trained them to
nothing but injustice and ambition, and taught them only to
be jealous, arrogant, perfidious, and cruel?  A prince must

<!-- page 549 -->

expect that his people will act towards him as he has taught
them to act towards others. If he labors to render them good
both by his example and authority, he will reap the reward of
his labor from their virtue; or, at least, in his own, and in the
favor of the gods he will find abundant consolation for his disappointment."</p>

<p>As soon as Mentor had done speaking, Telemachus advanced
hastily towards the Ph&aelig;acians, whose vessel lay at anchor near
the shore. He found among them an old man, of whom he
inquired whence they came, whither they were going, and
whether he had seen Ulysses.</p>

<p>"We have come," said the old man, "from our own island,
Corcyra, and we are going for merchandise to Epirus. Ulysses,
as you have been told already, has been in our country,
and has now left it." "But who," said Telemachus, "is he
that, while he waits for the departure of your vessel, seems to
be absorbed in the contemplation of his own misfortunes, and
retires to the most solitary parts of the island?" "He," said
the old man, "is a stranger, of whom we have no knowledge.
It is said that his name is Cleomenes, that he is a native of
Phrygia,<sup id="t_ref169"><a href="#t_en169">169</a></sup> and that, before his birth, it was declared by an oracle
to his mother, that, if he quitted his country, he should be
a king; but that, if he continued in it, the gods would denounce
their anger against the Phrygians by a pestilence. He was,
therefore, delivered to some sailors, by his parents, as soon as
he was born, who conveyed him to the island of Lesbos, where
he was privately educated at the expense of his country, which
had so great an interest in keeping him at a distance. As he
increased in stature, his person became at once comely and
robust, and he excelled in all exercises that render the body
agile and strong: he also applied himself, with great genius
and taste, to science and the arts; but no people would suffer
him to continue among them. The prediction of the oracle
concerning him became generally known, and he was soon
discovered wherever he went: kings were everywhere jealous,

<!-- page 550 -->

lest he should supplant them in their thrones. Thus he became
a fugitive from his youth, wandering about from country
to country, without finding any place in which he might be
allowed to remain. He has visited nations very remote from
his own, but the secret of his birth, and the oracle concerning
him, is discovered as soon as he arrives. He endeavors to
conceal himself wherever he goes, by entering into some obscure
class of life; but he is soon discovered by his superior
talents for war, literature, and government, which break out
with irresistible splendor, notwithstanding his efforts to repress
them. In every country he is surprised into the exertion of
his abilities by some unforeseen occasion; and these at once
make him known to the public. His merit is his misfortune;
for this he is feared wherever he is known, and excluded from
every country where he would reside. It is his destiny to be
everywhere esteemed, beloved, and admired, but excluded
from all civil societies upon earth. He is now advanced in
years, and yet he has not hitherto been able to find any district
either of Asia or Greece where he may be permitted to
live in unmolested obscurity. He appears to be wholly without
ambition, and to desire neither honor nor riches, and if the
oracle had not promised him royalty, he would think himself
the happiest of mankind. He indulges no hope of returning
to his native country, for he knows that to return thither would
be to bring mourning and tears to every family. Even royalty
itself for which he suffers, is not desirable in his opinion; he
is fulfilling the condition upon which it is to be acquired in
spite of himself, and, impelled by an unhappy fatality, he pursues
it from kingdom to kingdom, while it flies like a splendid
illusion before him, as it were to sport with his distress, and
continue an idle chase, till life itself shall have lost its value
with its use. How fatal a gift is reserved for him by the gods!
How has it embittered those hours which youth would have
devoted to joy! and how has it aggravated the infirmities of
age, when the only felicity of wearied nature is rest! He is
now going, he says, to Thrace, in search of some rude and
lawless savages, whom he may collect into a society, civilize,

<!-- page 551 -->

and govern for a certain time; that thus, having fulfilled the
oracle, the most flourishing State may admit him without fear.
If he succeeds in this design, he will immediately retire to a
village in Caria, and apply himself wholly to his favorite employment,
agriculture. He is a wise man, his desires are
moderate, he fears the gods, and he knows men, and though
he does not think them worthy of esteem, can live peaceably
among them. Such is the account that I have heard of the
stranger after whom you inquire."</p>

<p>Telemachus, while he was attending to this narrative, often
turned his eyes towards the sea, which began to be troubled.
The wind now swelled the surface into waves, which breaking
against the rocks, whitened them with foam. The man observed
it, and, turning hastily to Telemachus, said: "I must
go, or my companions will sail without me." He then ran
towards the vessel,&mdash;the mariners hurried on board, and a confused
clamor echoed along the shore.</p>

<p>The stranger, whom they called Cleomenes, had wandered
about in the middle of the island, and climbing to the summit
of many of the rocks, had eyed the boundless diffusion of
waters around him with a fixed and mournful attention. Telemachus
had still kept sight of him, and remarked him in
every situation. His heart melted with compassion for a man,
who, though virtuous, was wretched and a fugitive, formed for
great achievements, yet condemned to be the sport of fortune,
and a stranger to his country. "I," said he to himself, "may,
perhaps, once more see Ithaca; but the return of this Cleomenes
to Phrygia is impossible." Thus Telemachus received
comfort from contemplating the misery of a man more wretched
than himself.</p>

<p>The stranger no sooner perceived his vessel ready to sail,
than he rushed down the craggy sides of the rock with as
much agility and speed as Apollo bounds from precipice to
precipice in the forests of Lycia,<sup id="t_ref170"><a href="#t_en170">170</a></sup> when, with his silver hair
gathered in a knot behind him, he pursues the stags and boars

<!-- page 552 -->

that fly from the terrors of his bow in vain. When the stranger
was on board, and his vessel, dividing the waves, gradually receded
from the shore, the heart of Telemachus died within
him; he felt the keenest affliction without knowing the cause;
the tears flowed unbidden from his eyes, and he found nothing
so pleasing as to weep.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the mariners of Salentum, overcome with
fatigue, were stretched upon the grass near the beach in a
profound sleep. A sweet insensibility was diffused through
every nerve; and the secret, but powerful influence of Minerva
had, in full day, scattered over them the dewy poppies
of the night. Telemachus was astonished to see the Salentines
thus resign themselves to sleep, while the Ph&aelig;acians, ever active
and vigilant, had improved the favoring wind; yet he
was more intent upon watching their vessel, which was now
fading from his sight in the horizon, than upon recalling his
mariners to their duty. A secret and irresistible sense of astonishment
and concern kept his eyes fixed upon the bark which
had left the island, and of which the sails only could be seen,
that, by their whiteness, were just distinguished from the
azure of the sea. Mentor called to him, but he was deaf to
the voice; his faculties seemed to be suspended, as in a trance,
and he had no more the possession of himself than the frantic
votaries of Bacchus, when, grasping the Thyrsus in their hands,
the ravings of their phrensy are re-echoed from the banks of
the Hebrus,<sup id="t_ref171"><a href="#t_en171">171</a></sup> and the rude acclivities of Ismarus<sup id="t_ref172"><a href="#t_en172">172</a></sup> and Rhodope.<sup id="t_ref173"><a href="#t_en173">173</a></sup></p>

<p>At length, however, the fascination was suspended; and,
recovering his recollection, he again melted into tears. "I do
not wonder," said Mentor, "my dear Telemachus, to see you
weep; for the cause of your trouble, though to you a secret,
is known to me. Nature is the divinity that speaks within
you; it is her influence that you feel, and, at her touch, your
heart has melted. A stranger has filled your breast with emotion:

<!-- page 553 -->

that stranger is the great Ulysses. What the Ph&aelig;acian
has told you concerning him, under the name of Cleomenes, is
nothing more than a fiction, invented more effectually to conceal
his return to Ithaca, whither he is now going. He is
already near the port; and the scenes, so long desired, are at
length given to his view. You have seen him, as it was once
foretold you,<sup id="t_ref174"><a href="#t_en174">174</a></sup> but you have not known him. The time is at
hand when you shall see him again; when you shall know
him, and be known by him; but the gods could permit this
only in Ithaca. His heart did not suffer less emotion than
yours, but he is too wise to trust any man with his secret,
while it might expose him to the treachery and insults of the
pretenders to Penelope. Your father Ulysses is the wisest of
mankind; his heart is of unfathomable depth; his secret lies
beyond the line of subtlety and fraud. He is the friend of
truth, and says nothing that is false; but, when it is necessary,
he conceals what is true; his wisdom is, as it were, a seal upon
his lips, which is never broken, but for an important purpose.
He saw you, he spoke to you, yet he concealed himself from
you. What a conflict must he have sustained, what anguish
must he have felt! Who can wonder at his dejection and
sorrow?"</p>

<p>During this discourse, Telemachus stood fixed in astonishment,
and at length burst into tears. His wonder was mingled
with the tenderest and deepest distress, and it was long
before the sighs that struggled in his bosom would permit a
reply. At length he cried out: "O my dear Mentor, there
was, indeed, something in this stranger that controlled all my
heart&mdash;something that attracted and melted me&mdash;a powerful
influence without a name. But, if you knew him, why did
you not tell me, before he departed, that he was Ulysses?
Why did you not speak to him yourself, and acquaint him
that he was not unknown to you? What do these mysteries
conceal? Shall I be wretched forever? Will the gods, in
their anger, doom me to the torments of Tantalus, whose burning

<!-- page 554 -->

lips a delusive stream approaches forever, and forever flies?
O my father, hast thou escaped me forever? Perhaps I shall
see thee no more! Perhaps the suitors of Penelope may take
thee in the snares which they spread for me! Oh, had I followed
thee, then, if life had been denied us, we might at least
have died together! O Ulysses, Ulysses, if thou shalt escape
another shipwreck (which, from the persevering malice of fortune,
there is reason to doubt), I fear lest thou shouldst meet,
at Ithaca, as disastrous a fate as Agamemnon at Mycene.<sup id="t_ref175"><a href="#t_en175">175</a></sup> But
wherefore, O my dear Mentor, did you envy my good fortune?
Why have I not already embraced my father? Why am I
not now with him, in the port of Ithaca? Why am I not
fighting at his side, and exulting in the destruction of his
enemies?"</p>

<p>"Let me now, my dear Telemachus," said Mentor, with a
smile, "show thee to thyself, and thus acquaint thee with the
weakness of mankind. To-day you are inconsolable, because
you have seen your father without knowing him. What would
you have given, yesterday, to know that he was not dead!
To-day your own eyes assure you that he lives, and this assurance,
which should transport you with joy, overwhelms you
with distress. Thus do mankind, by the perverse depravity of
their nature, esteem that which they have most desired as of
no value the moment it is possessed, and torment themselves
with fruitless wishes for that which is beyond their reach.</p>

<p>"It is to exercise your patience that the gods thus hold you
in suspense. You consider this time as lost, but be assured
that it is, more than any other, improved. The distress which
you now suffer will exercise you in the practice of that virtue
which is of more importance than all others, to those who are
born to command. Without patience you can be master neither
of others nor yourself. Impatience, which appears to be
the force and vigor of the soul, is, indeed, a weakness&mdash;the
want of fortitude to suffer pain. He that knows not how to
wait for good, and to endure evil, is subject to the same imbecility

<!-- page 555 -->

as he that cannot keep a secret; they both want power
to restrain the first impulse of the mind, and resemble a charioteer,
whose hand has not strength to restrain his impatient
coursers in their headlong speed; they disdain the bridle, they
rush forward with ungoverned fury, the chariot is overturned;
and the feeble driver is crushed under the wheels. An impatient
man is thus precipitated to ruin, by the violence of impetuous
and ungoverned desire. The more elevated his station,
the more fatal his impatience. He waits for nothing, he
despises deliberation, and takes all things, as it were, by storm;
every enjoyment is a violence and an injury; he breaks down
the branches to gather the fruit before it is ripe; he forces the
door, rather than wait till it is opened; and resolves to reap,
when the prudent husbandman would sow: all his actions are
precipitate, and out of season; all that he does, therefore, is
done amiss, and must be futile and transient as his own desires.
Such are the extravagant projects of a man who vainly imagines
that he can do all things, and abandons himself to every impatient
wish that prompts him to abuse his power. Your patience
is thus tried, my dear Telemachus, that you may learn
to be patient; and, for this cause, the gods have given you up
to the caprice of fortune, and suffered you to be still a wanderer,
to whom all things are uncertain. The great object of your
hope has just appeared and vanished, like the fleeting images
of a dream when the slumbers of the night are past, to apprise
you that the blessings which we imagine to be within our
grasp, elude us, and disappear in a moment. The best precepts
of the wise Ulysses would instruct you less than his
absence, and the sufferings which, while you sought him, you
have endured."</p>

<p>Mentor then determined to bring the patience of Telemachus
to another trial, yet more severe than any that were
past. At the moment, therefore, when the hero was urging
the mariners to set sail without delay, Mentor suddenly stopped
him, and proposed that they should offer a solemn sacrifice to
Minerva upon the beach. Telemachus consented without remonstrance
or complaint.  Two altars of turf were immediately

<!-- page 556 -->

prepared, the incense smoked, and the blood of the
victims was shed. The youth looked up to heaven with a sigh
of tenderness and devotion, and acknowledged the powerful
protection of the goddess.</p>

<p>As soon as the sacrifice was ended, he followed Mentor into
the darkest recess of a neighboring wood. Here he suddenly
perceived the countenance of his friend assume a new form;
the wrinkles disappeared as the shadows of the night vanish,
when the rosy fingers of Aurora throw back the portals of the
east, and kindle the horizon with the beams of day; his eyes,
which were keen and hollow, changed to a celestial blue, and
sparkled with divine radiance; his beard, grizzled and neglected,
totally vanished, and the sight of Telemachus was
dazzled by new features, which were at once mild and awful,
lovely and majestic. He beheld the countenance of a woman,
soft and delicate as the leaves of a flower just opening to the
sun, and blooming with the tints both of the lily and the rose;
it was distinguished by the ineffable beauty of eternal youth, and
the easy dignity of simple greatness. Her flowing hair filled
the air with ambrosial odors; and her robes shone with a
various and a vivid splendor, like the clouds of heaven, which
the sun diversifies and irradiates with his earliest light. The
divinity was no longer supported by the earth, but reclined
upon the air, in which she floated like a bird in it flight. In
her hand was the shining lance, at which nations tremble, and
Mars himself becomes sensible to fear. Her voice was sweet
and placid, but penetrating and strong. Her words pierced
the heart of Telemachus like shafts of fire, and thrilled him
with a kind of delicious pain. Upon her helmet appeared the
solitary bird of Athens, and her dreadful &aelig;gis glittered upon
her breast. By these characteristics Telemachus knew that he
beheld Minerva.</p>

<p>"And is it thou thyself," said he, "O goddess, who, for the
love that thou bearest to Ulysses, hast vouchsafed guidance and
protection to his son . . . ?" He would have said more, but
his voice failed him; and the thoughts that rushed with impetuous
tumult from his heart, his tongue labored in vain to

<!-- page 557 -->

express. He was overwhelmed by the presence of the divinity,
like a man who is oppressed by the loss of breath in a dream,
and who, although agonized with an effort to speak, can articulate
nothing.</p>

<p>At length the goddess addressed him in these words:
"Hear me, O son of Ulysses, for the last time! I have hitherto
favored no mortal with such instructions as I have vouchsafed
to thee. In countries unknown, in shipwreck, in battle,
in every situation of danger and distress by which the heart
of man can be tried, I have been thy protection. For thee
I have illustrated by experiment all maxims of government,
both false and true. I have improved not only thy misfortunes,
but even thy faults into wisdom. Who can govern, that
has never suffered? Who can avoid error, but by experience
of its evil?</p>

<p>"Thou hast filled earth and ocean with disastrous adventures
like thy father, and art now worthy to follow him to
Ithaca, where he has this moment arrived, and whither thy
passage is short and easy. In battle let thy station be at his
side; obey him with implicit reverence, and let the meanest
subject learn his duty from thy example. He will give Antiope
to thy wishes; in this alliance thy object was rather merit
than beauty, and it shall be happy.</p>

<p>"When thou shalt be invested with sovereign power, let it
be thy only ambition to restore the golden age. Let thy ear
be open to all, but let thy confidence be confined to few.
Trust not implicitly to thy own virtue or thy own wisdom.
Fear to deceive thyself, but fear not that others should know
that thou hast been deceived.</p>

<p>"Love thy people; neglect nothing that may inspire them
with love of thee. Those whom love cannot influence, must
be ruled by fear; but this expedient, like a violent and dangerous
remedy, should always be used with reluctance.</p>

<p>"Undertake nothing of which thou hast not considered the
most remote consequences; look steadily at the future, whatever
evils it may present; and know that true courage consists
in the anticipation and contempt of necessary danger.

<!-- page 558 -->

He who will not voluntarily look danger in the face, will shrink
from the sight when it is obtruded upon him; he only is wise
and brave who willingly looks on all that can be seen, who
shuns all that can be shunned, and meets that which is inevitable
with equanimity.</p>

<p>"Avoid luxury, profusion, and pomp, and place thy glory in
simplicity. Let thy virtues be the ornaments of thy person
and thy palace; let these be the guards that surround thee;
and let thy example teach the world in what honor consists.</p>

<p>"Let it be constantly present to thy mind, that kings reign
not for their own glory, but for the good of their people. The
virtues and the vices of kings entail happiness or misery upon
mankind, to the remotest generations, and a bad reign sometimes
produces calamity for an age.</p>

<p>"Above all, guard against thy humor: it is a bosom enemy,
which every man is condemned to carry with him to the
grave; it will enter into all thy councils; and, if indulged,
will certainly pervert them. It will prevent thee from improving
opportunities of advantage; it will prefer shadow to substance,
and determine important affairs by petty considerations.
It obscures talents, depresses courage, and renders a man
feeble, inconstant, odious, and contemptible. Against this
enemy, be continually upon thy guard.</p>

<p>"Let the fear of the gods, O Telemachus, be the ruling passion
of thy heart: keep it sacred in thy bosom, as thy dearest
treasure; for with this thou shalt possess wisdom and
justice, tranquillity and joy, unpolluted pleasure, genuine freedom,
peaceful affluence, and spotless glory.</p>

<p>"I now leave thee, O son of Ulysses! But, so long as thou
shalt feel the want of my wisdom, my wisdom shall remain
with thee. It is now time that thou shouldst walk by the light
of thy own mind. I withdrew from thee in Egypt and at
Salentum, that I might reconcile thee to the want of that
assistance and comfort which I afforded, by degrees, as a
mother weans an infant from the breast, when it is no longer
necessary to feed it with milk, and it is able to subsist upon
more solid food."</p>

<!-- page 559 -->

<p>Such was the last counsel of Minerva to Telemachus; and
while her voice yet vibrated on his ear, he perceived her rise
slowly from the earth, and, a cloud of intermingled azure and
gold surrounding her, she disappeared. Telemachus stood a
moment astonished and entranced; then, sighing, prostrated
himself upon the ground, and stretched out his hands towards
heaven. After this homage was paid, he arose, awakened
his companions, hastened their departure, arrived in Ithaca,
and found his father under the friendly roof of his faithful
Eumenes.</p>

by death; but it is a detriment to be a god; and the gate of death being
shut against me, extends my grief to eternal ages."</p>

<p id="t_en003"><sup><a href="#t_ref003">3</a></sup>The discourse of Ulysses to Nausicaa (<i>Odyss</i>., vi. 149) begins with a
similar thought: "I supplicate thee, O queen, whether thou art some
goddess or mortal." &AElig;neas, in Virgil (<i>&AElig;neid</i>, i. 327), says to Venus,
whom he meets without knowing her: "O virgin, by what name shall I
address thee? for thou wearest not the looks of a mortal, nor sounds thy
voice human. O thou a goddess surely!"</p>

<p id="t_en004"><sup><a href="#t_ref004">4</a></sup>F&eacute;nelon seems to remember those verses which Virgil (<i>&AElig;neid</i>, v. 626,)
puts in the mouth of Beroe: "The seventh summer since the destruction
of Troy is already rolled away, while we, having measured all lands and
seas, so many inhospitable rocks and barbarous climes, are driven about;
while along the wide ocean we pursue an ever-fleeing Italy, and are tossed
on the waves."</p>

<p id="t_en005"><sup><a href="#t_ref005">5</a></sup>Homer (<i>Odyss</i>. vi. 107), describing Diana in the midst of her nymphs
says that she is a head taller than all: "Above all by her head and her
forehead, for she is easily known, but all of them are fair." Virgil, speaking
of Turnus (<i>&AElig;neid</i>, vii. 784), uses the same image: "Turnus himself, a
comely personage, moves on in the van, wielding his arms, and by a full head
overtops the rest." Milton, too, has borrowed the image (<i>Par. Lost</i>, ix. 386):</p>

<p>&mdash;"but Delia's self<br/>

In gait surpassed, and goddess-like deport."</p>

<p id="t_en006"><sup><a href="#t_ref006">6</a></sup>"For whom dost bind thy golden hair, plain in thy neatness."&mdash;Horace,

<p id="t_en007"><sup><a href="#t_ref007">7</a></sup>"Nor ivory, nor fretted ceiling adorned with gold, glitters in my house:
no Hymettian beams rest upon pillars, cut out of the extreme parts of Africa."&mdash;Hor.
II., <i>Od</i>. xviii.</p>

<p id="t_en008"><sup><a href="#t_ref008">8</a></sup>These and some of the following details are taken from Homer's description
of Calypso's grotto (<i>Odyss</i>., v. 60-70). "He came to the great
cave in which the fair-haired nymph dwelt, and he found her within. A
large fire was burning on the hearth, and at a distance the smell of well-cleft
cedar, and of frankincense, that were burning, shed odor through the
island: but she within was singing with a beautiful voice, and going over
the web, woven with a golden shuttle. But a flourishing wood sprung up
around her grot&mdash;alder, and poplar, and sweet-smelling cypress. There,
also, birds with spreading wings slept, owls, and hawks, and wide-tongued
crows of the ocean, to which maritime employments are a care. There a
vine in its prime was spread about the hollow grot, and it flourished with
clusters. But four fountains flowed in succession with white water, turned
near one another, in different ways; but around these flourished soft meadows
of violets and of parsley. There, indeed, even an immortal coming
would admire it when he beheld, and would be delighted in his mind."</p>

<p id="t_en009"><sup><a href="#t_ref009">9</a></sup>It is probable that F&eacute;nelon has used the word amaranth, without attaching
to it any definite meaning, simply designating by it any agreeable
flower.</p>

bend and to grow in the form of a mountain, and to send forth a roaring

<p id="t_en014"><sup><a href="#t_ref014">14</a></sup>The French poet, Quinault, in his tragedy of <i>Armide</i> (II. 8), which
Voltaire called a masterpiece, and which inspired Gl&uuml;ck while composing
his opera of the same name, precedes F&eacute;nelon in this beautiful imaginative
picture:</p>

<p>"This river gently flows,<br/>

Regretfully leaving a region so charming."</p>

<p id="t_en015"><sup><a href="#t_ref015">15</a></sup>This was the B&oelig;otian Atalanta. When her father desired her to marry,
she required every suitor to contend with her in the foot-race, because she
was the most swift-footed of mortals. If he conquered her, he was to be
rewarded with her hand; if he was conquered, he was to be put to death.
She conquered many suitors, but was at length overcome by Hippomenes
with the assistance of Venus. The goddess of love had given him three
golden apples, gathered in the gardens of the Hesperides, and during the
race he dropped them one after the other: their beauty charmed Atalanta
so much, that she could not abstain from picking them up, and Hippomenes
thus gained the goal before her. She accordingly became his wife.</p>

<p id="t_en026"><sup><a href="#t_ref026">26</a></sup>The city of Himera, in Sicily, was celebrated in antiquity.  It was situated
west of the mouth of the river Himera, whose source was at the
foot of the Nebrodes, the great chain of mountains running through the
whole island. Mount Acragas was in the neighborhood of the city of the
same name, the Agrigentum of the Romans, the Girgenti of to-day.</p>

<p id="t_en027"><sup><a href="#t_ref027">27</a></sup>"As a famished lion, making wild havoc amid a sheep-fold (for ravenous
hunger prompts him on), grinds and tears the flock, feeble and

made by Euryalus: he too, all on fire, rages throughout, and in the middle
falls upon a vulgar, nameless throng."&mdash;<i>&AElig;n</i>., ix. 339.</p>

<p>"He then . . . . advanced, brandishing two spears, like a lion reared

<p id="t_en030"><sup><a href="#t_ref030">30</a></sup>Sesostris, according to Diodorus Siculus (i., ch. lv.), subdued Ethiopia,
the greater part of Asia, and the Thracians in Europe. The chronology
of Herodotus could not be reconciled with the narrative of Telemachus;
for, according to him, Sesostris reigned a century earlier than the taking
of Troy. The calculation of Diodorus is more favorable to F&eacute;nelon. Besides,
we must not exact too much from a work of imagination.</p>

<p id="t_en031"><sup><a href="#t_ref031">31</a></sup>Both Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus recount this fact.</p>

Many passages from the ancients, containing this idea, could be collected.</p>

<p id="t_en037"><sup><a href="#t_ref037">37</a></sup>Herodotus says (II., ch. clxxvii.) that, in the reign of Amasis, there
were in Egypt twenty thousand populous cities. According to Diodorus,
Egypt, in remote times, contained eighteen thousand cities; and more
than thirty thousand, under the first Ptolemy. See Rawlinson's note upon
the passage of Herodotus.</p>

<p id="t_en038"><sup><a href="#t_ref038">38</a></sup>Thebes of a hundred gates, called, also, Diospolis by the Greeks, is

<p id="t_en041"><sup><a href="#t_ref041">41</a></sup>This eulogy of books and reading is true, and beautifully expressed; but
the period of Sesostris suggests to the critic an anachronism. "These
studies," says Cicero (<i>pro Archias</i>, &sect;7), "are the food of youth, the delight
of old age; the ornament of prosperity, the refuge and comfort of
adversity; a delight at home, and no hindrance abroad; they are companions
by night, and in travel, and in the country."</p>
