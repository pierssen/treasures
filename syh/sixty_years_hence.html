<h2>SIXTY YEARS HENCE.</h2>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE LADY CALLIRO&Euml;.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is early in the month of December, of the
year of our Lord <span class="smcap">one thousand, nine hundred
and six</span>.</p>

<p>In the uppermost chamber of the loftiest
tower of a baronial castle, the Lady Calliro&euml;
reclines upon the silken cushions of her ottoman.
The apartment overlooks the sea upon

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

one side, and through the opposite casement
displays an extensive land view. A vast park
occupies the foreground, studded with old
trees, whose scanty foliage, reduced to a few
leaves which linger, sere and withered, on the
boughs, discovers a distant view of copse and
covert, hill and dale, white farms, green fields,
and village spires.</p>

<p>The sun shines brightly&mdash;though the air
is dry and chill, and the soil still wet with
recent rain. The sea, which is open and unbayed,
extends its placid surface in glassy
smoothness, showing its pulsations only by the
occasional gleam of some light-refracting
ripple in the distance.</p>

<p>The land presents the same aspect of repose
as the water; and the very deer, who give life
to the landscape, having browsed their fill, sun
themselves listlessly in the dry fern, whose
rich hues harmonise so well with the mossy
trunks of the venerable oaks.</p>

<p>This scene is English.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

<p>Where is there any other land, than England,
home of the oak, which can exhibit that full
and massive arboreal structure&mdash;rivalised only
by the chesnut-tree&mdash;not of nature, but of
Claude Lorraine?</p>

<p>England, where the majestic oak and the
lowly underwood look more complete and
shapely, when stripped of all their leaves, than
the woods of more highly vaunted climes in
their full foliage&mdash;where this luxuriancy of
vegetation is not the partial result of an intolerable
sun, which, favouring one form of
vegetable life, scorches up others from the arid
soil&mdash;but, on the contrary, allied to eternal
freshness. There is only England where the
meadow relieves with its deep green, the woodlands,
and the trees, when the wintry mist
lingers about their base in hues of blue or
purple, whilst the dense boughs and sapless
leaves of their summits are bathed in sunlight.</p>

<p>It is one of the few days of her mild winter,

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

when the winds are hushed and the sky&mdash;whose
habitual humidity generates this freshness&mdash;blue
and clear, so that the landscape seems
glowing in the beams of a bright spring day, if
seen without feeling that chilliness precursive,
probably of coming frost.</p>

<p>And so it is seen from the apartment of the
Lady Calliro&euml;, through the crystalline purity
of the plate-glass, which, filling alike the open
window spaces and the fretted stone-work of
the gallery surrounding her apartment, shuts
out the bleak air and incloses not a spring
temperature only, but a tropical climate.</p>

<p>A tropical climate, with all its products,
most costly, rare and fragrant, cooled down to
pleasantness by artificial draughts which envelop
the dweller in its atmosphere, whose
weight&mdash;moving, standing, or reclining&mdash;whether
on the gorgeous cushions, or on the
floor tiles&mdash;carpet-covered, or glittering in mosaic
brilliancy&mdash;disengages, by its pressure,

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

currents of air alternately charged with varying
perfumes or in all the purity of the
mountain breeze.</p>

<p>If we were to open a little volume amongst
the gold-clasped tomes which lie upon that
ivory cheffonier, we should find that it treats
"of an art unknown to our forefathers&mdash;even
half a century back&mdash;though, by its means,
not only gratifications are secured, which they
can never have tasted, but even health and
life prolonged. Not but that some inkling
of the existence of these arts had dawned
upon them, though being ignorant of the harmonies
of fragrance&mdash;of inspiration and of
aspiration&mdash;their rude attempts were hurtful
or discordant, as the use of artificial sounds
by the first savage who bellowed
through a wild bull's horn&mdash;sounds which we
blend and mingle now into such soul-entrancing
melodies.</p>

<p>"Where, not quite ignorantly or rudely, they
were mischievously used, as in the memorable

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

instance of that Doctor Reid, whose
effigy in our children's bonfires has supplanted
that of the traditionary and once
popular Guy Fox. To expiate the attempt
made by this personage, to destroy by gunpowder
the Parliament of Great Britain, and
which attributed to the instigation of the
Jesuits, if not wholly fictitious, was assuredly
never put into execution, he was
strangely enough held up to obloquy by
the very generation destined (in 1848) to
witness not the attempted, but the actual
destruction of a British House of Commons,
by the malignant Doctor, who, after torturing
that legislative body, for several years,
eventually extinguished it (obviously, at the
revengeful suggestion of the baffled protectionist
party,) as we see cruel children
suffocate mice in an exhausted air-receiver."</p>

<p>"Dr. Reid" continues the note at the
bottom of the page,</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Being arraigned and convicted in the autumn
of the same year, was sentenced to solitary

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

confinement for the term of his natural
life; being the first criminal condemned after
the final abolition of the punishment of death.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, a special act was passed by the
new Parliament to meet so unparallelled a crime
by some peculiar infliction, and it was provided, as
a proportionate aggravation of punishment,
that his confinement should take place in a building
ventilated on his own principle."</p>

</div>

<p>Thanks to this art, in that chamber,
whose pilasters are wreathed with exotic fruits
and flowers&mdash;its fair occupant reclines inhaling
and surrounded by, an atmosphere so temperate
that the many hued humming birds fluttering
about this bower, quit frequently the congenial
vegetation of their native clime to hover round
her, and that the gazelle crouches at her side; all,
as if enamoured of her fair person, with proximity,
to which they have learned to connect the
refreshing coolness which they once sought in
the shade of their tropical woods, and now find
by approaching her.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; is an inmate meet of such
a bower.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

<p>Young, precocious, and fragile, she is as
much an exotic as those plants and animals
surrounding her, which would wither
or perish in the northern air of the climate
they are dwelling in.</p>

<p>Like the rare flowers, which half the
world has been ransacked to bring together,
her beauty if not positively greater, is of a
kind more striking, because more unusual
than the loveliness of our own land.</p>

<p>Not that its character is southern&mdash;on
the contrary&mdash;her aspect rather denotes a
northern origin.</p>

<p>Her hair is what is termed dark in the north
and in the south of Europe fair&mdash;her complexion
what both agree to be so.</p>

<p>She has eyes of that rare hue termed blue
conventionally, but which are really of a deep
violet, such as we see without its varying
tints in the pansy, without its transparency
in the changing plumage of the bright birds
flitting round her.</p>

<p>Though her complexion is almost Teutonic in

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

its fairness, the least emotion of an exquisitely
sensitive nervous organisation, renders the
arteries visible through her transparent skin,
and throwing into some of her features a subdued
half tint of purple gives them more than
the character and expression of oriental
beauty.</p>

<p>In temper and in years&mdash;a child; in passion
and in form&mdash;a woman:&mdash;no Hindoo maiden
on the Ganges' banks has grown to earlier
maturity. If not robust, at least no sickly
rapidity of growth has marred the perfection
of her figure; and if her fragile charms are
destined to fade early, they blend just now
childhood's spring freshness with the impassioned
loveliness of woman's summer.</p>

<p>At a first glance one might be tempted to
compare the Lady Calliro&euml; to a tender plant
of the temperate zone whose seed some wind had
wafted&mdash;some bird carried&mdash;to a torrid clime
where, sheltered by the shade of a protective
palm, whilst losing nothing of its freshness, it
had derived from the inclement sun rapidity

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

of growth, vividity of perfume, and peculiarity
of hue.</p>

<p>But this comparison would be inapt, for she
resembles rather some of those foreign flowers
which curious botanists (who value more a
new variety of the nettle than the sweetest
rose) bring into our hot-houses from over
sea.</p>

<p>Here, in a factitious soil and artificial atmosphere,
the humble flower which bloomed in
native insignificance, gathers, through culture,
gorgeous colouring, or surpassing fragrance,
queening it over the fairest produce of our
fields in which, untended by man's care, its
actual vitality would be withered up. So the
very life of the Lady Calliro&euml; is artificial. She
owes to human ingenuity and science that she
breathes, and lives, and blooms.</p>

<p>An organic malady without such aid would
long since have rendered fatal alike the hot blast
of the south or the keen air of her native land.
If she had been a poor man's child, or if she had
been born half a century back, those delicately

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

rounded limbs might lie fleshless in their
mouldering shroud; that fair brow which
emulates the purity and softness of the marble
might glare in the ghastly whiteness of the
coffined skull; and the worms crawl slowly
through those apertures whence now the soul
radiates from her beaming eyes in looks of
liquid love.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; is the only daughter of
a senator and magnate of the united monarchies,
a merchant prince, like all his class. His
mines, lands, fisheries, factories, and banks
were once scattered over both hemispheres;
but he has now concentrated them into lands,
villages, and manufactories, for the purpose
of acquiring political influence. He has long
been, and is still, one of the most powerful
members of the most powerful party in existence;
though his credit is said to be diminishing
with his party, and the credit of his party
with the world.</p>

<p>As far as the eye can reach, even taking in the
distant church spire and the factory chimneys of

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

that distant town on the horizon, and the
lighthouse of that harbour round the headland,
with all the broad acres, villages, and farms,
which intervene, own him as their lord;&mdash;the
Lady Calliro&euml; as their heiress.</p>

<p>There lives no man in real rank above her
father, who may write M. M., or <span class="smcap">many millioned</span>,
after his name. His position is not
a thing of yesterday, still redolent of the vulgarity
of recent acquisition. This baronial
castle&mdash;the princely demesne, surrounding it
has descended to him by inheritance; and even
half a century ago his family were wealthy;
so that he claims priority of fortune over all
his fellow senators; a fact which perhaps detracts
from his popularity, in an age in which
most men plume themselves, first, on the
amount of their wealth; and secondly, on
the rapidity of its acquisition.</p>

<p>If you had lived sixty years ago (in 1846)
you might have seen in a linen-draper's shop,
on the left hand side, in Oxford Street&mdash;which

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

was even then a great thoroughfare of the
modern Babylon&mdash;old Samuel Lofty palming
upon his customers gents' cheap gloves, cravats
and half hose with all the zeal and more than
the assurance of his shopmen. In that year he
closed his shop and went abroad. He was
ruined by the railways; that is to say, he
shortly after started as a capitalist. In 1850, he
was dead; but the house of Lofty, carried on
by his son, was as well known in the commercial
as now in the political world.</p>

<p>In 1860, John Lofty purchased this Castle,
and was refused a baronetcy.</p>

<p>In 1865, <i>he</i> refused an earldom.</p>

<p>In 1870, he bought the imperial jewels of
the proscribed house of Romanoff, and generously
set up the last scion of the house of
Hapsburg in trade as a sugar baker.</p>

<p>In 1880, his son, the present senator, succeeded
him. When the civilised conservative
states of Europe united into the Federative
monarchies, on the establishment of the

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

senatorial order of <span class="smcap">millionaries</span>, he was one of
the first upon the roll; and when, at the
happy termination of the war waged with the
Democratic Union, the honourary distinction of
M.M., or <span class="smcap">many millioned</span> was decreed, he
again assumed the first place in the new order.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no woman breathing
whose position in the age in which we live is
more enviable than that of the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago, when duchies and earldoms
were not mere empty titles,&mdash;when they had
not become ridiculous, by constant association,
during a quarter of a century subsequently,
with corns, sore legs, pulmonary complaints,
and all the ills and inconveniences that man
is heir to,&mdash;when, in short, the peerage indicated
power and fortune, and that all the names
in it had not been converted into pegs on which
to hang the puffs of empirics, till some ingenious
quack began to recommend his pills by
disclaiming all connexion with the aristocracy&mdash;in
those golden days the Lady Calliro&euml; might

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

have occupied the position of that young
Duchess who smiles from one of Chalon's
sketches in the Castle gallery, and still have
seen reason to envy her present condition.
The delicate state of her health during so
many years, and the tender solicitude of her
father have, however, retarded her entrance
into that society of which she has yet seen but
transient glimpses, and in which she longs to
mingle and to shine.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; hence knows less than most
other women of her years and station of politics,
not that her nature is unambitious, but that her
girlish ambition is still confined to a longing
for the admiration of the brilliant throng
which has dazzled her from a distance&mdash;to the
homage of all whose homage can confer distinction,
and to the envy of all who should dispute
with her the apple. Yet this vision is not the
mere aimless dream of a coquette, because it
blends, in her imagination, into a little
romance of love, of which her cousin Julian

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

is the hero, she the heroine. When she has
gathered at her feet all those who will bow to
fortune, power, and broad-lands, and driven her
lover to despair, she thinks that then it will
be passing sweet, in defiance of usage and the
disapprobation of the world, to say to him:&mdash;"Julian!
here is this hand, which statesmen,
senators, and millionaires covet;&mdash;this hand
with all this hand can give, I place in thine,
asking only in return that heart surrendered
to me long ago."</p>

<p>How comes it then that she reads through
with such deep attention that closely written
political epistle? Because love and politics
are blent in that artful missive&mdash;the sweet that
lures so many petticoated politicians deep into
the bitterness of its unprofitable lore&mdash;and
which prompts the Lady Calliro&euml; to ask for the
morning papers, so unusual a demand as to
astonish the Greek and Hindoo women, who
wait upon her in their national attire as formerly
it was worn, and as it still glitters in

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

costume books; for all the world knows that
now-a-days the Asiatics wear nothing but
Manchester striped cotton goods, and straw
hats&mdash;that the Greek mountaineers array themselves
in wideawakes, and Chesterfields; and
that the dresses of their women correspond.
The letter which the lady Calliro&euml; perused ran
as follows.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE LETTER.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> affect indifference to politics, my
dear Calliro&euml;, but I am determined to make
you a politician in spite of yourself. Considering
your position and your prospects,
your abilities and your seductive powers, it
would really be a sin for you to abstain from
participation in public affairs. Politics afford
to our sex a pursuit offering far more variety,
interest, and amusement than the ordinary occupations
of our lives without their frivolity.

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

Men may indeed rule the world, but we govern
the men. Think only what it is when every
tribute which female beauty elicits, every
mark of homage woman receives&mdash;every smile
she deigns to smile, has a marked agency upon
the destiny of man, that Lord of the creation&mdash;sometimes
of men by millions&mdash;instead of being
wasted like the sweetness of the flower, or
the warbling of the bird to glad the eye
and ear, and be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Think what it is when you can trace the
fate of whole communities to the zeal of a
convert you have made, or to the success of
plan you have concerted, and&mdash;if all these considerations
fail to influence you think&mdash;what it
is to build up magnificently the fortunes of
those whom you have judged worthy of your
friendship&mdash;who love and admire and appreciate
you as I do, and who, like myself, would
feel eternally grateful for your intercession in
my favour. Or I should say rather in favour of
one near and dear to me&mdash;one on whom the

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

brightest eyes of beauty beam encouragement
in vain, though I believe he would really give
up all the world contains to bask in the sunshine
of your own. Need I name my brother,
your cousin Julian.</p>

<p>"Poor Julian! whose thoughts waking or
dreaming are of you, and who, notwithstanding
my pity, seems so happy in that contemplation&mdash;poor
Julian seems long to have excluded
all but your fair image from his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Instead of endeavouring to relieve the
fallen fortunes of his house, he has remained
apathetically indifferent, allowing opportunities
and events to flow past him like an unconcerned
spectator.</p>

<p>"If he is now aroused from that apathy it is
because the same object which led to his indifference
serves as a spur to his ambition&mdash;because
he has suddenly become conscious that a chasm
divides him from his cousin, the heiress&mdash;poor
and powerless as he is with nothing but the

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

memory of his family's greatness in a sordid
age which would value a live farm-yard bird,
for the egg it gives, above the ashes of a dead
phoenix.</p>

<p>"This chasm he has however resolved to
overleap or perish, as we have so often seen
him light-heartedly urge his iron-grey Selim
over a desperate leap. There lies indeed but
one path open to him&mdash;the federative service,
and he had once interest with the minister.
I trust indeed that he has some still, but
this interest has been long diminishing, pretty
much in proportion, as my brother has required
it, both because it requires it, and
because the number of candidates for such
offices as he covets is continually increasing.</p>

<p>"Our Sir Jasper is a great minister, and a
great man, but he is inscrutable and unapproachable.
He has long since half passed
his word in our favour, but without any limitation
of time for the fulfilment of his promise.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

<p>"Now Julian's necessities are urgent, and his
love born ambition cannot brook delay. In
the next place, the rationalist party&mdash;but hold!
I forget that when last we met, you did not
and would not understand even the broadest
party distinctions. Let me, therefore, explain
to you the chief cards of the political game,
beginning with the <i>rationalist</i> party, of which
I must premise by telling you that you are a
member, though this piece of information may
cause you as much astonishment&mdash;but, I trust,
less indignation&mdash;than was evinced by the very
celebrated Lady Cash, who, aware of her
deficiencies, commenced a tardy course of instruction
under the village school-master, and
was outraged past expression, when told that
she belonged to the animal kingdom, to a
viviparous class and biped genus, and breathed
atmospheric air, through the agency of her
respiratory organs&mdash;insinuations which her
ladyship most wrathfully and abusively rebutted

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

declaring, 'that if she had not always
been genteel and fashionable, she was come of
honest parents, and a christian woman, who
had been baptised, vaccinated and confirmed,
and breathed through the mouth and nose like
her neighbours.'</p>

<p>"Heigho! with all her ridicules I wish I were
Lady Cash. I should not be long in obtaining
an interview with Sir Jasper then,
nor would our poor Julian be lingering on
vague promises, instead of starting in that
race in which he considers power and honours
only as a means&mdash;the necks of rivals and competitors
only as a footpath along which he
would hurry to the goal&mdash;the feet of his fair
cousin, the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>"To continue with my exposition then, you
and I, and your father, and everybody, who is
anything are <i>rationalists</i>. All who can write
M. M. after their name, or who are bound by
any sort of tie to any one who can belong
<i>ipse facto</i> to the rationalist party, or can

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

only be influenced by motives most unnaturally
sinister if they do not.</p>

<p>"All that we rationalists wish is to maintain
the legitimate influence of wealth, as the good
sense of the age has established it in the federative
monarchies. We recognise&mdash;as all others
do in their hearts&mdash;the extent of an individual's
possessions as the most unerring qualification
for entitling him to the exercise of power,
since the acceptation of this basis allows us
to measure the extent of this fitness with
mathematical accuracy from thousands down to
units. But there is another opinion which our
party hold in common, (though some think fit
ostentatiously to disavow it,) which is simply,
that&mdash;whilst we acknowledge the right of admission 
which the accumulation of wealth gives
to the patrician body;&mdash;whilst we allow such a
person as Lady Cash at once to take precedence
of your fastidious friend&mdash;we are by no means
anxious to afford facilities to the vulgar to gather
any large amount of capital together, even though
once acquired, in spite of our efforts, we recognise

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

legally and socially the claim, and absorb its
fortunate possessor into our ranks. What can
be more rational, since every addition to our
number diminishes the distinction of our position,
and that even if the rising family only
replace another fallen, it is detrimental to that
process of social refinement which the perpetuation
of power and capital, in certain
families, are sure to produce?</p>

<p>"Of this party Sir Jasper is the leader. Of
Sir Jasper's followers your father is one of
the most distinguished. Its ascendancy is,
however, disputed; and&mdash;between you and me&mdash;is
perilled by the <i>moderates</i>. I need not
tell you that the Federative representation is
composed of the house of <i>millionaires</i> in which
sit the M's and M.M's, and of a house consisting
of the representatives of that vulgar mob
of petty capitalists who call themselves T.T's,
<i>or ten thousand men</i>, though many of them, I am
told, can only boast that sum in business credit.</p>

<p>"This party is decidedly hostile to us; and its

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

members even broach among them the absurd
doctrine 'that a certain amount of wealth in
the hands of a hundred men should give that
hundred the same authority as if concentrated
in the possession of one individual'&mdash;indeed
even raise an outcry for some laws to limit
the combination of the great capitalists against
them.</p>

<p>"Hitherto the common-sense men&mdash;as they
term themselves&mdash;and God knows everything
about them is <i>common</i> enough&mdash;men who would
make the united monarchy such another
den as the Democratic Union,&mdash;of which you
may judge by its ambassador, once brought
to my boudoir to be exhibited, and redolent
of the vile smell of tobacco! These common-sense
men&mdash;who are all for the rights of
labour, and who hate T.T's rather worse
than M.M's&mdash;have hitherto kept the <i>moderates</i>
in awe.</p>

<p>"The <i>rationalists</i> have still great majorities.
In the eyes of the world we are still triumphant,

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

and Sir Jasper a tower of strength.
But I have a terrible secret to confide to your
discretion. A hidden but powerful combination
menaces our party with expulsion
from office after thirty years' enjoyment of
the sweets of power.</p>

<p>"Great, general, and repeated losses have
embarrassed the affairs of our most valuable
supporters, and a very powerful neutral party,
who have some time kept neutral&mdash;are either
joining or mean to join the moderates, and, if so,
sooner or later we must fall. Now with the
moderates we have no interest; and before
this untoward event comes to pass, every
effort must be made to obtain for Julian the
fulfilment of Sir Jasper's promise. There is
at this moment unoccupied the military secretaryship
to the vacant governorship of Japan;
it will be kept long open as usual by the
minister, to play off many candidates. Now
I have set my heart, with all the energy
of a woman's will, on obtaining this office for

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

my brother. And I come to you, dear Calliro&euml;,
to aid me in an enterprise hopeless
without your succour.</p>

<p>"Your father is one of Sir Jasper's most
valuable partisans; you must leave him no
repose till you have secured his interest."</p>

<p>"Poor Julian," said the Lady Calliro&euml;, as her
colour came and went, "I would do anything for
him in the world, but how speak of him to my
father, who I know has even taken his intimacy
here unkindly? If I had not been kept
in such seclusion&mdash;if my introduction to society
had not been so long protracted, I might have
had opportunities of seeing Sir Jasper
himself. He is accessible to my father&mdash;why
should he not be so to me, and how
could he refuse me this boon for my cousin?"</p>

<p>At this moment the door of the boudoir
opened and Lord Lofty stood in the presence
of his only child. He was a man middle-aged,
cold, and a little haughty in his aspect, with a
high brow&mdash;unintellectual although charged

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

with thought. The frigidness of his demeanour
warmed for a moment as he kissed his
daughter's eyes and forehead, and sat down
beside her on her ottoman.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> child," said the senator, "I have come
to hold a long conversation with you."</p>

<p>"It is not often that you hold long conversations
with your daughter lately."</p>

<p>"No, in truth;" replied her father, passing
his hand impatiently over his forehead, as if
by that mechanical action to remove a painful
impression; "but the duties of my station
and a world of cares have lately harassed
me."</p>

<p>"And is not that the time, when cares
harass you, to seek solace here?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

<p>"No, my Calliro&euml;. Why sadden your
young heart with an old man's perplexities?
You are a thing fitted only for joy and sunshine;
and, therefore, I choose rather, when I
come, to be the harbinger of good tidings than
to impress you with the gloom of my forebodings."</p>

<p>"And if your tidings are so bright, how
comes it, my father, that your manner is so
solemn?"</p>

<p>"Because the object of my visit, though
glad, is solemn, dear Calliro&euml;?"</p>

<p>"Glad yet solemn?" echoed Calliro&euml;, whose
curiosity was not the less vividly piqued by this
exordium, because two dusty carriages had
driven through the park that morning, bearing
mysterious visitants,&mdash;a circumstance not in
itself remarkable, considering the political relations
of the senator, but which became so
in connexion with the fact that this arrival had
caused her father&mdash;immutable in his intentions,
as the Medes and Persians in their laws&mdash;to

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

abstain from attending a public meeting, for
which he had been many days preparing.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, listen to me. If for some
time I have appeared neglectful towards you,
believe that I have not been unmindful of
your happiness. I see that you look around
you as if to say, these birds&mdash;these gems&mdash;this
fairy bower&mdash;my Arab palfrey&mdash;and my
hawks&mdash;my castled home in England&mdash;and
my villa on the &AElig;gean sea;&mdash;these are mere
toys that pall as childhood ripens; but all this
is not happiness. I <i>know</i> that it is not happiness.
I feel, and I always have felt, that this would
not suffice to youth, with its disquieting curiosity
and flattering hopes&mdash;and, may be, with a consciousness
of a social station, at which I rejoice,
and of personal attractions, in which I
take a father's pride. I have always felt that
it was natural that you should seek to mingle
in the world; but your precarious health, less
than your tender years, obliged me to withhold
you from it. If it had not been for this consideration,

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

I should have deemed the gratification
of your desire a duty of my station.
For it is one of the duties we owe to our
order, and, indeed, to society, to maintain that
station in its dignity; and a house without
female presidency is shorn of half the attractions
of its splendor, and of all the graces of
its hospitality."</p>

<p>"My father," said the Lady Calliro&euml;, a
little disdainfully, "do not waste your eloquence
upon me, I do not care a straw for the
duties of my station; but I am weary of being
secluded from the gay world, in which I long
to mingle like others of my age and birth.
Six months ago, the greatest of all living
doctors told you that my health depended
more upon keeping my mind amused than on
repose or care; and here I am dying of ennui.
I know what you have come to tell me&mdash;that
you are called to town, and going to leave me
in my solitude."</p>

<p>"Not so, my child," replied the senator, "I

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

believe that you have outgrown the perils
which threatened your childhood. I long to see
you the cynosure of all eyes; and I think the
time arrived for your introduction to the
world."</p>

<p>The air of weariness and langour with which
the Lady Calliro&euml; pushed aside her gazelle, as
the senator commenced speaking, suddenly
gave way to an undisguised expression of
joyous satisfaction, as she threw her arms
round her father's neck.</p>

<p>He kissed her kindly, but somewhat coldly,
on the forehead; for he was not a man of
warm effusions, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, the time is come for you
to play your part on the great stage of public
life."</p>

<p>"And when&mdash;this season?" asked his
daughter, in a tone in which a wild delight
was childishly mixed with eager anxiety.</p>

<p>"That," replied the senator, "depends on
circumstances. If at all, directly&mdash;in a week,

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

or even in a day, for we may start for town
to-morrow; but if it is to be I must protest
against the frivolous spirit in which you seem
to regard an act so serious as your entrance
into life. That act, considering your position,
becomes a political event. If on the one
hand, your rank gives you singular advantages,
on the other, it entails serious charges; and,
considering the interests of the order you belong
to&mdash;of your house, and of the perilous times in
which we live, it would be unworthy of your
station to embark on a mere frivolous career&mdash;on
a mere life of fashion, without connecting
it with those political aims to which you
show such marked distinction."</p>

<p>"Now, in truth, my father, you misunderstand
me. Launch me into the world, like
a bird fresh winged&mdash;give me a life of
pleasure and of action, and I care not what
aim I seek by a path so sweet. As for political
aims I may relish their pursuit, though
I object, as a spectator, to the prosiness of

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

politics. I do not even know how far I may
not become interested by personal acquaintance with the chief actors in the great game of
parties: for their leaders, since you see them,
will be all accessible to your daughter?"</p>

<p>"All who shine either in the rationalist or
the moderate party," replied the senator, with
undisguised satisfaction at this triumph over
the indifference of his child.</p>

<p>"Even the celebrated Sir Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Even the great and good Sir Jasper, the
head of our party, and the powerful premier
of the federate monarchies. He is not, indeed,
a man who courts society like his rival, but
Sir Jasper himself, my personal friend, will be
always accessible to her who represents the
house of Lofty."</p>

<p>"Never mind the rival," laughed the beauty,
"unless he became a minister."</p>

<p>"That must never be, my little politician;
for though right in the abstract that one
minister in <i>esse</i> is worth twenty in <i>futuro</i>, we

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

are, by our position, placed above that commonplace
truth, and must stand or fall, like our
whole order, by Sir Jasper."</p>

<p>"And I am, therefore, really to be introduced
to the great world immediately? and
why do you qualify that promise by a doubt?"</p>

<p>"You are really to be introduced to the
great world, to preside over my festivals and
banquets, and to uphold the state and dignity
befitting the chief supporter of the most powerful
of all human beings; but," added the
father, taking his daughter's hand, "now for
the more serious part of my communication,
for which, indeed, you are better fitted than I
had hoped in this respect&mdash;that there lurks
beneath a graceful frivolity which I had never
penetrated&mdash;a degree of good sense and creditable
ambition which will inspire you, I am
sure, with resolution and decision equal to the
emergency. Listen, therefore, my child:&mdash;On
the one hand, you are ushered into society with

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

prospects such as all your sex might envy&mdash;rank,
power, wealth, and fortune, will be the
heralds of your advent into life; but, at the
same time, I must confide to you that we live
in critical times. It is impossible to say
whose fortunes are not undermined&mdash;whose
social existence is not threatened. We have
reached a crisis which will determine for
ever the stability of our whole body, and the
perpetuity and increase or the overthrow of our
wealth, influence, and power. Are you prepared
to play a great part at this critical juncture?&mdash;do
you feel yourself equal to great
sacrifices?&mdash;to pass at once from childhood into
resolute womanhood, overstepping the transition
of girlish years?&mdash;do you feel that you are
equal to the magnitude of the occasion?&mdash;that
you are capable of taking a decision which
will secure the fortunes of your house, the
gratitude of your party, and open to you a
career of pleasure and of power?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; opened wide her deep
liquid eyes of violet-blue, in which there
sparkled the expression of a new sensation,
self-undefined. Such, in the breast of a cage-bred
bird, responds to the wild note of a free
mate. Such the young colt, reared on the
desert sands, with camel's milk and corn, feels
at the sight of a green pasture. Such agitates
the heart of a young maid when it flutters
in the first palpitations of unacknowledged love.
It is the expression of a newly awakened
instinct or passion destined perhaps to
sink into quiescence, but living though
latent.</p>

<p>The words of her father had disturbed in
the bosom of the Lady Calliro&euml; a thrill of ambition,
which strongly and unconsciously troubled
her, though this unwonted sensation
subsided again into a feeling more natural to
her sex, and defined itself in the hope of
furthering the fortunes of her cousin, Julian,

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

through the influence prospectively held out
to her.</p>

<p>"After such an appeal, my father, I must
answer you decidedly. I say, therefore, open
me the world, and you will not find me
wanting in courage, or decision. I fear
nothing, excepting solitude, and ennui. Give
me the prospect of power&mdash;the hope of ready
intercourse with those who rule the masses&mdash;let
me have access to such statesmen as Sir
Jasper, and I will dare any peril, make any
sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Scarcely a sacrifice, my child."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever can further any end you
may have in view&mdash;unless, indeed, it were, a
marriage," replied the Lady Calliro&euml;, laughing,
"though my eloquent and dignified sire would
never have introduced such a subject like the
guardian or the uncle of an old French comedy."</p>

<p>The senator bit his lip and was silent for a
moment&mdash;he then abruptly rose and quitted

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

the apartment, and a few minutes after returned
with a stranger, to whom he presented
her, saying, "This is the Lady Calliro&euml;,"
and then retired without further comment
from the presence of his astonished daughter.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE INTERVIEW.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lady Calliro&euml; was a few instants before
she could recover her surprise at this singular
introduction and strange <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>The personage so unaccountably ushered into
her presence, was a man who, in point of age,
might have been her father. His countenance
was open, and his manner frank and urbane,
without either being expressive of absolute
sincerity. He was distinguished by an expression
rather of sarcasm acquired in self-defence

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

than of exuberant or native wit, and
his whole aspect bore more the impress of
perceptive acuteness and plausibility, than of
genius. His costume was neat, and such as
might have befitted a man within ten years
either way of his time of life, his manner was
urbane and unpretentious.</p>

<p>The first thought of the Lady Calliro&euml;, when
she coupled the apparition of this personage
with the mysterious hints let drop by her
father, was to divine that he came in the
character of a suitor&mdash;for she could find no
other probable solution to the mystery.</p>

<p>Now, both the age and person of such a candidate,
and the mode of his introduction, were
so preposterous in her estimation, that an uncontrollable
sensation of the ludicrous came
over her, and if she restrained herself from
open laughter, its mirth played unequivocally
about the expression of her lips and eyes.</p>

<p>"I am proud to make the acquaintance of
the daughter of my dearly valued friend," said

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

the stranger, who saw, at a glance, that he was
unknown; "and if I have unceremoniously
invaded this retreat, besides the temptation of
paying her my respects, I can plead a special
motive."</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml;, whose matrimonial
thoughts had only wandered from the image
of her cousin, Julian, to dwell upon the quick
eyes and the lithe limb of youth&mdash;on its flowing
locks and silky moustache of gold-shot chesnut
or of raven black&mdash;the Lady Calliro&euml; would
have laughed outright at the pretensions of a
suitor whose head was growing bald, and whose
unsymmetrical rotundity of figure, the restraint
of a tight-fitting waistcoat could no longer
conceal&mdash;only that as she satirically scrutinised
his face and figure, it gradually struck her that
both were familiar to her eye, though she
could not recall having ever seen the personage
before her&mdash;unless in a dream, or, as a moment's
further reflection suggested, in a picture, and

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

almost simultaneously with this thought, the
truth flashed upon her&mdash;and the truth was almost
startling.</p>

<p>That picture in which her eye had grown
accustomed to the lineaments of the face before
her, was a portrait that hung in the state-room
the full-length size of life, besides being reproduced
in busts, engravings, and miniatures
in every apartment of the Castle&mdash;it was the
portrait of the Sir Jasper, the celebrated premier,
and consequently the great minister&mdash;Sir Jasper
stood before her.</p>

<p>Her heart fluttered, for a moment, at finding
herself thus, without preparation, in the presence
so great a celebrity, but she possessed that presence
of mind, peculiar to highly susceptible
nervous organisations&mdash;and consequently more
common in women than in men&mdash;which may
fail in ordinary times, but is roused by a sudden
emergency and great occasion.</p>

<p>She might have felt embarrassed in the presence
of any of the political chiefs of whom

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

he was the supreme leader, and her courage
might have failed if her recent wishes had been
realised according to her anticipations. If
she had sought and found an interview with
him in the ordinary course of events, prepared
to plead the cause of her cousin, Julian, she
might have remained tongue-tied in the great
man's presence, but thus brought suddenly in
juxta-position with him, she so rapidly recovered
her self-possession&mdash;that when saying,
"Your father has forgotten to name his old
friend," he held out his hand with an appearance
of cordial frankness destined to put her at her
ease, or to modify that awe which the discovery
of his real character was calculated to
inspire, she met his proffered salutation with
graceful ease, and replied with perfect self-possession&mdash;</p>

<p>"Both my father's friend, and Sir Jasper, are
above the formalities of introduction."</p>

<p>The statesman was somewhat puzzled. He
had dreaded too much timidity, and he found

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

an ease and coolness no less untoward in this
young girl, who had not yet even picked up
assurance by intermixture with the world.</p>

<p>The man whose persuasive powers guided,
or whose combinations influenced classes and
masses&mdash;whose words were listened to with interest
throughout the civilised world, and to
whom, at that very moment, despatches from
every quarter of the globe were hurrying over
land and sea&mdash;that man found it necessary to
his purpose to convert an inexperienced child
to his views, and to obtain her accession to a proposition
which even her father had hesitated to
make.</p>

<p>This singular necessity was obvious from his
being then in her boudoir, hundreds of miles
away from the scene of action, where, at the
same hour, a political storm was brewing up,
which would probably burst that very night,
or certainly the ensuing one, in the senate.
In this emergency, when his party was waiting
for its leader, that leader found himself far

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

away, face to face, with a young girl whom it
was necessary to win over to his views, and to
win in the only one brief interview which the
pressure of time afforded!</p>

<p>He had been prepared to find her spoiled,
and self-willed, and he dreaded the impossibility
of placing her, in so brief an interval,
sufficiently at her ease, to induce her to listen
to his arguments; but he had not contemplated
such a reception, marked by a satiric
scrutiny, which he, at first, attributed to ignorance
of his identity&mdash;an idea which her
words dispelled, and which had next quickly
merged into a quiet self-possession very disquieting
to the minister. He had, perhaps, rather have
faced the whole opposition in full cry, with
nothing but an array of mishaps and disasters
to set off against their grievances, than the
fulfilment of his present mission.</p>

<p>"Your welcome is gratifying to the friend,
and flattering to the statesman," replied Sir
Jasper, adding with assumed <i>bonhommie</i>,

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

"though, if you judge me to be placed, by my
public services, above the formalities of common
intercourse, I, using an old man's privilege,
may observe, even to yourself, that the
Lady Calliro&euml; is equally beyond the pale of
ordinary conventionalities, by her beauty and
acquirements."</p>

<p>The senator's daughter cast an involuntary
glance at the glass opposite to her, as she answered,
a little disdainfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My acquirements exist only, I fear, in the
partial belief of a father; and if I am what
the world calls fair, I have seen in our great
cities far greater beauty unnoticed&mdash;because
in rags."</p>

<p>"That is true; but never united to your
talents."</p>

<p>"My talents! I fear they have no being
but in your courtesy."</p>

<p>"I repeat your talents and your station&mdash;or
perhaps rather, I should have said, your station
and your genius. To speak frankly; I, the

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

premier of the "Federative Monarchies," would
hardly be just now conversing with the youthful
daughter of my friend, if much was not in
her power, and I should not speak so unreservedly
if I had not recognised in her an
intellectual superiority self-unrevealed perhaps
but abundantly manifest to me, accustomed
by my avocation, so to say, to read the
human character as I run. You are beautiful,
my fair child, though I take little heed of
beauty; your station is exalted; and in your
eyes I see the flash of genius and the restless
light of aspiration, though indeed you may not
feel it; for some one must discover the gem beneath
its crust. I may be mistaken, but I cannot
look upon you and believe that you are made to
dwell in such insipid retirement&mdash;amidst birds
and flowers&mdash;in a sort of valetudinarian nursery."</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, who had been watching the
countenance of the young girl intently, as he
spoke, to seize some indication of the effect of

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

his words, paused for a moment; and hereupon
she interrupted him, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really, Sir Jasper, I can hardly think that
all this is not a dream, when I find myself
conversing familiarly with so renowned a statesman;
but can the genius of the legislator, like
the <i>ennui</i> of a captive girl, only lead him to
the natural conclusion, that it would be agreeable
to be set free? or did your penetration
lead you to divine that the chief object of my
wish to be launched into the world was to find
there this very opportunity which has come to
seek me?"</p>

<p>"How so?" said the minister, inquiringly;
for he could gather from her manner no indication
of her meaning, since she spoke half in
pleasantry and half in earnest.</p>

<p>"I was longing ardently only an hour ago
to be ushered into life; but is it possible that
could you have divined that my chief motive
was the hope of an interview with you?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" said Sir Jasper to himself.

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

"This is awkward. Does the girl think that
I am making love to her?"</p>

<p>"Such an avowal," he replied at length, as
paternally as possible, "is flattering, my dear
child, it would have been dangerously flattering
made by such lips as yours before you were born&mdash;before
I had become dead to all sense
of female grace, and had learned to estimate
women only by the standard of their political
value. If you really wished this interview
with one whose exceptional position is far
above his merits, it argues I am glad to see at
least political curiosity."</p>

<p>"I have none," said the Lady Calliro&euml;. "I
sought this interview with the <i>premier</i>, for I
did not then know Sir Jasper."</p>

<p>"From an intuitive curiosity, which was
ambition."</p>

<p>"I had no curiosity, I sought to ask a favour."</p>

<p>"Frankly spoken," said the minister "so
we shall understand each other. I too seek a
favour, which, if accorded will leave nothing

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

which you may not rather command than ask.
Nevertheless let me have the grace
of ministering to one of your desires whilst
my aid may still avail you."</p>

<p>"Your meaning is a mystery to me. My
inexperience of the world tempts you into a
vein of pleasantry, Sir Jasper; but I shall not
hold you the less to your promise."</p>

<p>"Pleasantry, my dear girl?" exclaimed Sir
Jasper, glancing anxiously at his watch; "my
character ought to guarantee that I am serious.
Tell me how I can have the happiness of serving
you, and let us dismiss the subject, to
proceed into those graver matters for which
I crave your ear."</p>

<p>"You are very powerful?" said the Lady
Calliro&euml;, musingly.</p>

<p>"You know my office. I have some slight
power."</p>

<p>"Though politics are a sealed book to me,
I know that you are the leader of the <i>moderate</i>
party&mdash;I know that you are possessed of

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

colossal power, which I trust may not speedily
depart."</p>

<p>The premier started and turned very pale.
For thirty years he had been the idol and the
chief of the Rationalists;&mdash;for thirty years he
had held the reins of power. The sarcasm of
his foes, and the taunts of a vindictive enemy,
during this period, had rebounded innocuously
from the triple armour of his self-possession;
why does he, therefore, betray such profound
emotion at the accidental misnomer of his
party by a mere girl, and at the doubt which
her words imply of his continuance in office?
Because his mind is haunted with the phantoms
of the conscience-stricken. The minister
feels that his fortunes hang by a thread, and,
though his name had grown identified with
the championship of the Rationalist party, he
is at that moment meditating a desertion to
the opposite camp.</p>

<p>To find his plans divined&mdash;his apostacy prematurely
known, filled him, therefore, with

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

terror. His first impression was that her father
had imprudently confided these dangerous facts
to the Lady Calliro&euml;; but an instant's reflection
taught him that this was impossible&mdash;at least,
as regarded his defection&mdash;because he had not
yet confided his intentions even to the senator.
But though this conviction flashed through
his mind instantaneously, it did not reassure
him; for he asked:</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that I belonged to
the Moderate party?" with such increased
agitation, that the Lady Calliro&euml;, astonished
at the vehemence of his manner, picked up
the letter she had laid down beside her on
the ottoman.</p>

<p>The sight of this letter so much further
alarmed the minister that, either believing or
feigning to believe it to be offered for his
perusal, he tore it open, and, having glanced
hurriedly at the signature, proceeded to devour
its contents. The first impulse of the Lady
Calliro&euml; was to snatch back the epistle really

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

ravished from her; but then remembering that
the request she had to make was specified in
it, and that this perusal would spare her the
embarrassment of an avowal, she allowed him
to read on.</p>

<p>"I see no mention here of my reported
secession to the Moderates," said the minister.</p>

<p>"Pardon my error," replied the Lady Calliro&euml;,
"I perceive now that I have confounded
<i>Moderates</i> with <i>Rationalists</i>&mdash;I feel that I have
said something hurtful to your political susceptibility;
but consider that my whole knowledge
of politics is derived from that letter."</p>

<p>The minister turned his penetrating eye
upon her; there was truth and candour in her
accent, and his brow gradually cleared.</p>

<p>The letter he had perused had relieved his
anxiety, and given him some data on which
to proceed in his negotiation with the senator's
daughter; but on the other hand he had become
at once acquainted with the certainty
of an obstacle on which he had not calculated.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

<p>"We must do something for this cousin
Julian," said the premier, at length, with a
smile, which brought a blush to the cheeks of
the Lady Calliro&euml;. "He has a sister who
is neither discreet nor modest in her demands.
It was impossible that she could know, when
she solicited your advocacy, that the combinations
of a few hours should raise her fair
friend from the seclusion of the nursery to a
station of high political importance. Yet,
even thus, it does not lie in my power to
confide to him such a post as the military
secretaryship of Japan! the idea is preposterous."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because it would be without all precedent&mdash;because
I should outrage a host of my supporters.
The military secretaryship, like the
governor-generalship, has been months unfilled
for fear of indisposing disappointed candidates&mdash;I
cannot bestow it on a person without
plausible claim or qualification."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

<p>"He is connected with my father."</p>

<p>"What of that connexion? Your father
scarcely owns him; the very husband of your
modest correspondent, his sister, regards him
with coolness. We do not live in an age when
relationship to those in power confers it;
I myself have nearer relatives in obscurity.
Your cousin Julian is a dashing,
reckless youth, who might still, as an <i>enfant de
bonne maison</i>, have played his part gallantly
half a century since, but now-a-days his follies
and his ruined fortunes&mdash;which he has no talents
to retrieve&mdash;have sunk him deep in the public
estimation."</p>

<p>"And when those near and dear to us are
sinking, should not that hour of need command
our sympathies&mdash;call forth our best exertions?"</p>

<p>"You are right, my child; but we must
keep within the bounds of the possible. I
could as soon make him <i>governor general</i> as
military secretary. Nevertheless, we will do
something, for his plight is sufficiently pitiable;

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

but now I recollect," added Sir Jasper,
affecting the utmost indifference in the
world, "it is probable that your cousin would
neither thank his sister, nor yourself, nor me,
for removing him so far. All the world knows&mdash;and
all the world, excepting myself, would
at once have remembered&mdash;that he could not
and would not live one day beyond the reach
of that fairest, most talented, least scrupulous,
and to him most fatal of women&mdash;Myrrah."</p>

<p>"It is a calumny!" exclaimed Calliro&euml;, with
flashing eyes&mdash;"at least to say so now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied the minister, coldly,
"it is a week since I saw him in her box&mdash;it is
a week, indeed, since I was at the opera."</p>

<p>The countenance of the statesman's victim
underwent all the sudden and startling change
of a southern sky and a summer sea&mdash;one moment
sunny, calm, and almost lifeless, and the
next awakened to an expression of storm and
menace, as the lurid clouds darken and the
surface of the water gathers into waves. But in

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

a very brief space her woman-like pride so far
triumphed over her emotion, that she made a
desperate effort to conceal it. Sir Jasper had,
meanwhile, averted his eyes in a manner so
natural, that he had not increased her embarrassment
by noticing the tear which rose and
glistened, and fell burning from her own, though
after a brief interval of silence, he resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excuse me if I have made an allusion
which you may deem indelicate&mdash;but it was
necessary frankly to expose the motives of my
objection&mdash;and at any rate such scruples would
be absurd in addressing you&mdash;as I must do&mdash;not
as the budding belle of a drawing&mdash;room, but as
the ally to whom a grey headed politician confides
the secrets of his cabinet. Will you now
give me your undivided attention?"</p>

<p>"Speak on&mdash;I listen," replied the Lady
Calliro&euml;, with assumed composure, and the
minister proceeded.</p>

<p>"I was observing then, my fair child, that
you are fitted for a very different existence,

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

and that a singular chance destines you
to play a distinguished part, not merely in
fashionable life, but in the world of politics.
In the days of childhood we are apt to indulge
in dreams of first love, just as, at a still earlier
age, we long to handle and appropriate the
colours of the prism, but when with more
matured experience, a woman seeks the practical
enjoyments which pre-eminence and the
possession of power afford; she sometimes struggles
through years to attain that position, which
offers itself to you on the very threshold of
your career. You have intellect, you have
beauty, and you have station, which is, to
these, like the polish and setting to the brilliant;
your father has political influence and
rank&mdash;but that rank, station, and influence, are
dependent upon wealth; and unhappily, his fortune
is sapped to its foundation&mdash;so that with
all the external signs of opulence, utter ruin
menaces your house."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens&mdash;my poor father!" ejaculated

the Lady Calliro&euml;; "but he has friends."</p>

<p>"He has true and faithful friends, but alas!
the fearful pressure from which he suffers, is
general. To be frank with you, I myself, at
this moment, require the full aid of his influence.
It is, indeed, just now the key-stone of
my power. If his fortune fail him, that influence
is gone; and, with the loss of its assistance
to me&mdash;after a struggle of thirty years&mdash;I
must succumb. Some rash hand, unskilled to
steer amidst the shoals and breakers of the
times, will seize the helm, impel our class to
ruin, and wreck the vessel of the State. Judge
therefore, whether I and they would neglect
any effort to save his grey hairs from humiliation?
Nor have we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All this is to me so strange and startling;
do you not jest&mdash;do you not exaggerate? Is
not my father still possessed of countless villages,
farms, parks, manors, harbours and factories?"</p>

<p>"Nominally, he still possesses them, but he

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

has been one of the chief victims of the great
financial struggle. For the real struggle between
the Rationalists and the Moderates has been financial.
You have heard no doubt how, within the
last few years, a strange disease spread universally,
destroying, in succession, the nutritive
principle of every farinaceous kind of food; you
have heard how nations were threatened with
famine, till science discovered remedies to stay
the vegetable contagion. These remedies
were monopolised by our great capitalists. We
thought, by possessing ourselves occultly of the
sources, whence all human food was derived, to
consolidate our power for ever, whilst enlisting
in our favour the sympathies of the masses
against the clamouring Commons&mdash;the minor
capitalists&mdash;who pressed so hard on our exclusivism.
It was a great idea, but through unforeseen
chances it has failed We were a few
hundreds who banded our millions of money
against the incalculable wealth of hundreds of
thousands&mdash;but in our body was unity&mdash;in

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

theirs, no common purpose. We all partially
involved our property (as your father did too
ardently and extensively) with almost the certainty
of a hundred-fold return. We should have
triumphed&mdash;One season more would have repaid
us amply, both in wealth, which is power&mdash;and
in power, which is wealth&mdash;had there not been
at work some influence more subtle or more
fortunate than our own&mdash;playing with us
the game that we were playing with
the people. In the belief that we were
only struggling with an adverse fortune,
which would change, we were led to the
verge of ruin. In truth, that great and glorious
body, whose cause I have battled so arduously
for a quarter of a century to uphold, bears in
itself&mdash;I care not to avow it&mdash;the seeds of dissolution.
Like Milo, a party strove to rend
the oak, and the rebound has cramped its power
for ever. So much for the apotheose of our order&mdash;but
a daring intellect outlives the ruin of
parties; and when one kind of material fails,
still manages with another to build up greatness.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

<p>"You may find me tedious, but I must explain.
The Moderates are on the verge of triumph.
The best of my followers crippled or ruined,
like your father. Their lands, their ships,
their factories, their stores, are partly, or&mdash;like
his&mdash;entirely mortgaged. A man who
has risen from the dust&mdash;a man without education,
eloquence, or, as was long believed, even
common ability&mdash;heads a party, into whose
hands unaccountably have accumulated these
vast gains which we were to have made, and
the property so rashly ventured. Even you,
no doubt, have heard of the famous
Cash, for his celebrity grows every
hour. This domain, this castle, the very
luxuries that surround you, dear Lady Calliro&euml;,
are not your own&mdash;they are not your father's&mdash;they
are pledged to this child of Mammon,
whose inconceivable success appears like a
resistless fate. This new power&mdash;this man of
gold has long kept neutral with his adherents
and confederates in the political struggle. At

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

this hour the Moderates believe that they have
won him over. They know our weakness, they
know that our party can never rally&mdash;but, beaten
by an inexorable fortune, as they thought&mdash;I
have yet devised a scheme to baffle their leader,
and to snatch the crown of triumph from his
brows. I have discovered a means of increasing the power and fortune of my friend, your
father, instead of sharing in his ruin; but to
effect this purpose I must have the co-operation
of his daughter."</p>

<p>"Mine?" said the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yours," echoed the minister, and he took
her hand, tremulous with a vague apprehension.
"All that I ask of you is <i>this</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My hand!" exclaimed the Lady Calliro&euml;,
in unutterable astonishment. "Your lady&mdash;is
she dead then?"</p>

<p>"No, Heaven be praised!" replied Sir Jasper,
with a smile; "I should have said, the disposal
of that hand&mdash;give me but that, and I
will place a sceptre in it!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

<p>The beautiful eyes of the senator's daughter
flashed as she opened them wide in wonderment,
and then she shook her head mournfully
without reply.</p>

<p>"Four-and-twenty hours since," continued
the minister, "matters were still desperate.
The man of fate held in his hand cards with
which I would pledge myself to establish again
an individual and dynastic sovereignty as of
old. I saw him, my eloquence prevailed; I
have attached him not to a falling party, but
to my individual fortunes, and to those of my
faithful friends. As a hostage for his fidelity
he agrees that his only son shall lay his prospective
wealth and honours at your feet; and he
agrees to surrender his mortgages on your
father's property, settling it upon yourself;
and promising us besides the full support of all
his wealth and influence.</p>

<p>"One word of acquiescence from your lips,
and to-morrow John Cash and your father
join me in the newly constructed cabinet;&mdash;we

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

startle the House, by proposing the very
measure at which the Moderates have laboured
during years&mdash;overturning confusing, annihilating
parties and by that step&mdash;rearing up
from this chaos a new, and unshakable,
edifice of power, wherein the beautiful and
gifted daughter of my friend will throne as a
presiding deity."</p>

<p>"If I have solemnly promised that I would
never give my hand to any but one, Sir Jasper?"</p>

<p>"To one unfaithful and unworthy&mdash;to one
who loves another&mdash;which unbinds your promise.&mdash;Reflect
that at this moment the
Moderate party slumbers in the belief, that it
has monopolised this man of fate&mdash;at this moment
beauty, youth, and fashion are plotting
to secure the heir to his colossal wealth. I
have won them both. I have brought them
to your feet, in time to save the grey hairs
of your father&mdash;in time to save us
all&mdash;in time, by that one word of consent,
which you can speak, to give life to a mighty

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

combination&mdash;to stir to its foundations the
very frame-work of society, and to fill the
civilised world with wonderment."</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; looked up, and her
eyes flashed with an expression of elation
which a moment after subsided into sadness&mdash;"poor
Julian."</p>

<p>"Poor Julian!" echoed the minister,
"to whom you will show, in all its brilliancy,
the pearl he cast aside to toy with
a worthless shell&mdash;poor Julian whom your
generosity will save from ruin."</p>

<p>A flush of colour rose again to the tempted
beauty's brow, and her eye sparkled with
another flash, like the beam reflected from a
dark, blue billow. Her ambition and pride
were not less roused than her pity; but deeming
herself only a victim to her duty and magnanimous
compassion, she drew from this
self-deception a feeling of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"If I were to say yes&mdash;if I were to yield
to this necessity, I must make one stipulation
in favour of my cousin Julian."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

<p>"Noble girl," said the minister, "he shall be
cared for. I will pledge myself to satisfy him
with some post less embarrassing to confer than
that military secretaryship."</p>

<p>"Listen, Sir Jasper," said the Lady Calliro&euml;,
with solemnity, "either you have deceived
me and Julian loves me, or you speak truth,
and he loves another. In the one case, he has
all the sympathy of my soul; in the other,
my forgiveness. In one, I must strive that he
does not curse the memory of her who abandoned
him to his poverty and ruin; in the
other, I shall pray that he may be happy, and
provide that he shall bless the memory of her
whom he deceived. I am ready&mdash;the statesman's
victim is ready for the sacrifice&mdash;but
the price of this sacrifice shall be Julian's
happiness. I will discard the romantic dreams
of my girlhood to enter on the cold realities of
life; but the last act of that transition&mdash;its
inexorable condition shall be to shape out a
magnificent destiny for Julian. Did you not

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

say that the governor-generalship of Japan
was vacant?"</p>

<p>"It will not be so long. It is to be the
dowry of the Lady Calliro&euml;'s husband."</p>

<p>"It is a great office?"</p>

<p>"One that your father might covet."</p>

<p>"Then you must give it to my cousin Julian."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed the minister.</p>

<p>"Then my answer to your proposal is a
negative."</p>

<p>"That answer, rash girl, would be ruin."</p>

<p>"Ruin will only bring me where I leave
him. All barrier will be levelled then, I will
seek him out and hear from his mouth whether
his heart be mine or the actress Myrrah's."</p>

<p>"This is sheer madness," said Sir Jasper.
"I cannot entertain the matter now, but we
will hold council on it afterwards."</p>

<p>"No; you have no consent of mine, unless
you pledge your honour to confer the post in
question on Julian."</p>

<p>"He shall have the military secretaryship."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

<p>"You told me that you could as easily make
him governor-general. "</p>

<p>"A figure of speech. I must have thought I
was addressing the Commons. It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Then in the name of my departed mother
I declare that I reject your suitor."</p>

<p>The minister looked at his watch again.
Time pressed.</p>

<p>"It is a matter I cannot alone decide."</p>

<p>"Then farewell," said the Lady Calliro&euml;,
rising to withdraw. "If the victim be not
worth its price&mdash;you have my refusal now and
for ever."</p>

<p>"Stay," said the minister; "if it must be,
I will brave the world, I will make your cousin
governor. You have my word of honour, and
I have your consent?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but before the irrevocable act takes
place his commission must be signed, that I
may forward it with the farewell which I take
of him and of my woman's heart for ever."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

<p>"Your compliance is noble!" said the minister,
carrying her hand respectfully to his
lips.</p>

<p>"To-morrow's sun will see a tottering
house re-established; a perilled monarchy redeemed;
a veteran minister still the most
powerful of its subjects. And this he owes
to the greatness of your soul, and for this he
will ever yield to you the tribute of his homage.
I can only observe that time presses and that
events tread fast upon our heels."</p>

<p>"I am ready," said the Lady Calliro&euml;. "The
sacrificial wreath is round my temples&mdash;where
the advantage of delay?"</p>

<p>"This is too prompt," thought the premier,
and he added aloud, "preliminaries once arranged,
we may expect your future father-in-law
every hour. The bridegroom will be here
this night. But lest you should judge of the
son by the father I have his portrait here."</p>

<p>She took the portrait, but laid it down
beside her without bestowing on it a look.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

<p>The minister pressed her hand in his and
said, paternally:&mdash;</p>

<p>"God bless you, my child," then carrying
it again to his lips, he added, with solemnity,
"and Heaven prosper you, Madam, in your
greatness!"</p>

<p>When he was gone, the Lady Calliro&euml;
buried her face in the cushions and sobbed
aloud, pushing aside her gazelle, which, named
after her cousin, insinuated its head under
her white hand, as she said, audibly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Julian, Julian, what have I done? Where
are you, Julian?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE TRAVELLING COMPANION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fortunes of Julian Beauvoir were very
desperate. He could not venture to show himself
in any of the capitals; and, though there was
no prospect that delay would better his affairs,
his only thought appeared to kill the present
hour. In fact, he had always lived in the present,
and, reckless of the future, sought chiefly
some occupation which might drown reflection.
Such had been, during weeks past, his pursuit,&mdash;such
it was now, only that there mingled

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

with it a vague and indefinite hope, which he
dared only indulge in his most sanguine
moments, that ruin might still be retrieved
through an alliance with his wealthy cousin.</p>

<p>Originally received with kindness by her father
as the child of a near and dear relative, he had
for many years access to the Lady Calliro&euml;; but
as the power of the senator rose, and as his
nephew declined in the social scale&mdash;though
still received in the retirement of the country,
it was no longer on a footing of equality,
and as the period of the introduction of the
heiress into society approached, his reception
had grown gradually more chilling.</p>

<p>If the senator had any suspicion that the
sisterly affection of his daughter had ripened,
as it grew, into first love, he took little more
account of this circumstance than to consider
it as a slightly untoward event, which might
give her some childish pain, but of which the
impression would be rapidly obliterated on her
entrance into life.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

<p>Nothing, in truth, could exceed the wild improbability
of such a plan in the estimation of
Julian's scheming sister, and even sometimes
in his own; but he had renewed with such
success the gallantries of a past age,
and had found his follies popularly received
with such unaccountable indulgence as to be
sometimes led to imagine that the ardent
temperament of the Lady Calliro&euml;, and the
paternal affection of the senator for his only
child might be worked upon to produce a social
result in his favour, exceptional to its present
spirit. His sister had encouraged the prosecution
of his suit not with any belief in its
success, but because she foresaw in it a means of
interesting the uncle in favour of his nephew,
whether through the importunities of his
daughter, or through the necessity of relieving
himself from his presence.</p>

<p>Julian was at this moment meditating a
decisive visit to the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>It was the year in which, in due rotation,

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

the parliament of the Federative Monarchies
assembled in the capital of France.</p>

<p>The impending debate would necessarily
call thither all the supporters of the premier,
and hence it was probable that he should find
his cousin alone, a circumstance infinitely desirable
in itself; but then it was just possible
that a visit in the absence of his uncle might
have been provided for by his orders, and
would prove a bar not only to the projected
but to any future interviews.</p>

<p>In this perplexity Julian Beauvoir looked
out of his carriage down the diverging railway
lines, passing his long slender fingers&mdash;pinkly
transparent like the inside of a shell&mdash;through
the long ringlets of his raven locks,
and then pressed abstractedly to his lips and
against his no less pearly teeth, the large pearl
which formed the handle of his taper horsewhip.</p>

<p>His page seemed waiting the decision of his
capricious master, as he held back, with some

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

difficulty, by a silken rope, a pair of enormous
but beautifully symmetrical greyhounds, straining
the richly chased links of their golden
collars, as they strove to attract the notice of
their owner.</p>

<p>The eyes of the bystanders were however
diverted from him by the arrival of a fresh
train, from which three equipages, bearing on
their panels the distinctive sign of the son of a
<i>millionary</i>, and filled with his suite, were shifted
to another line. The owner of these equipages
meanwhile alighted to stretch his legs.
He was a young man of middle stature. His
face was round, his features not uncomely,
and their expression, both as to intellect and
distinction, that of literal mediocrity. In fact
everything about him&mdash;mind, person, stature,
and bearing, might have been characterised by
the same term. But this monotonous level&mdash;alike
without salient points of superiority or
the inequality of deficiency&mdash;formed a very
solid substratum, whereupon the addition of

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

rank and wealth sufficed, in the estimation of
the world, to constitute a most dignified superstructure.</p>

<p>This personage, Eustatius Cash, at once
exchanged signs of friendly recognition with
Julian; and in a few seconds they were strolling
arm in arm upon the platform.</p>

<p>Julian observed, that he half meditated an
invasion of his uncle's seat. His companion
replied, that, by a singular coincidence, he too
was about to pay a passing visit thither. He
therefore pressed him to decide and share his
carriage. Julian consented, and a few minutes
afterwards the pair were whirling and rushing
or rather <i>projected</i>, at the rate of a hundred
and fifty miles an hour, towards their destination.</p>

<p>It must not be hence be deduced that Julian
and young Cash were friends, at least in any
other sense of the word than that which implies
familiar intercourse; on the contrary, the reminiscences
of that intercourse were marked

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

by the recollection of ill-will and rivalry. The
sight of Julian conjured up in the mind of his
travelling companion three distinct scenes very
far from grateful to his memory, and little
calculated to inspire him with anything but
aversion.</p>

<p>It recalled to him the time of his first entrance
into fashionable life, when his father
was emerging from obscurity to take his place
amongst the wealthy of the land.</p>

<p>It recalled his reception when still timid
and inexperienced, by a circle of whom Julian
was the oracle, and he the butt, together with
all the pleasantry heaped upon him by those
who sought to make him expiate his prospective
millions through their sarcasm.</p>

<p>As there was nothing prominently ridiculous,
or even prominently marked about him, this
feeling had gradually subsided, and friends, parasites,
and admirers had gathered round him;
but then he became an unsuccessful rival
of Julian's, who was dissipating the capital of

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

his heritage against the annual allowance,
doled out somewhat parsimoniously for his
means, to Eustatius by his father.</p>

<p>Another phase had followed. His experience
grew, and so did the world's respect, as his
father's colossal wealth accumulated and his
power increased. Julian's influence, on the
contrary, had declined; he had even quitted the
field, and was, indeed, only returning from a
sojourn in the East, when once more they
came in contact.</p>

<p>Julian was then penniless; Eustatius Cash
the most discreetly magnificent magnate of
the Federative Monarchies.</p>

<p>At this period (1905), in the full zenith of
her popularity, of her glory, and her charms,
still bloomed the celebrated Myrrah, of whom
all the world remembers that she united
the gifts, the frailty, and the beauty of an
Aspasia, a Siddons, a Julia Grisi, and a Ninon
de L'Enclos.</p>
<p>Long success and unceasing adulation had

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

made this woman so impatient in the gratification
of her wishes, that a whim, if thwarted,
became a necessity of existence in her estimation.
She made the fortunes of managers,
scattered the fortunes of admirers, and, as usual,
neglected to secure her own.</p>

<p>On the occasion in question, this self-willed
and reckless personage had drawn her vast
salary, in anticipation, binding herself by a
heavy penalty to the manager to perform
during the Paris season. No sooner, however,
was her contract signed than she was seized
with an irresistible longing to spend that
winter in the south; but the manager was
inexorable: he claimed the restitution of the
salary she had anticipated, and enforcement of
the penalty she would incur; and the salary
alone was in itself a fortune. A half century
back it would have sufficed to fee two hundred
subalterns or curates, or sixty generals, or a brace
of bishops, or one agitator. In this dilemma
none of her many admirers were forthcoming,

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

and in her necessity she found only Eustatius
Cash&mdash;whom she had treated with contumely&mdash;who
would aid her; but Eustatius, only allowing
himself to be won over by degrees, made his
own stipulations. The actress found it necessary
to play to him from the stage in the eyes
of the whole capital&mdash;to exclude those who
displeased him from her suppers, and to wear
his bouquets in her bosom and in her hair;
nay, he farther imposed the hard condition,
that, if she wintered in Madrid or in Italy, she
should spend that season in retirement, and
not appear, as she had meditated, on the stage;
and lastly, he made the odious stipulation of
inflicting on her his distasteful company. On
these terms only did he consent to relieve her
from the thraldom of her tyrannical creditor.</p>

<p>When all was arranged, and that she had
yielded to these conditions, the manager was
sent for and ushered one morning into the
presence of Eustatius and the lady in her
boudoir. But he did not come unaccompanied&mdash;Julian

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

was with him. Though Julian had
been a favourite once, nothing could be more
provoking at that unpropitious moment than
his presence, but the vexation of the actress
was quickly dispelled&mdash;for the manager at once
introduced Julian as the present proprietor of
his lease, contracts and engagements.</p>

<p>Julian had been on his return from the east,
two thousand miles away when he received, at the
same time, the announcement of an inheritance,
and an account of the persecution of his
quondam friend. In forty-eight hours he had
traversed the space dividing them&mdash;he had
bought with his whole heritage the rights of
the manager, and he came in the very hour of
need to restore her liberty to Myrrah, by
throwing the receipts and contracts she had
signed into the fire.</p>

<p>The actress, so graciously set free, turned
maliciously to her would-be protector, and
pressed him to join herself and Julian, and
make a fourth with the manager at the very

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

breakfast-table, originally spread in his honour.
This affair was universally bruited, and not the
less impressed upon the dilettanti, that it was
the means of securing the charming vocalist
to them for the season&mdash;for no sooner was
Myrrah freed from her odious contract, than&mdash;whether
through waywardness or through
gratitude to Julian&mdash;she lost all longing for the
south, and performed steadily throughout the
season.</p>

<p>All these recollections rankled in the bosom
of Eustatius beneath an exterior placidly
cordial. As for Julian, he almost assumed
credit to himself for having forgotten and forgiven
these passages of their mutual history, as
he would assuredly have done had the case
been reversed&mdash;so incapable was he of bearing
ill-will to any human being. Though he had
never been at any time on terms of cordiality
with his present companion, he had greeted
him with sincere satisfaction, because too delighted
to meet so unexpectedly with one of

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

his own station, and because an involuntary
deference had succeeded to the contempt with
which he once professed to regard the heir to
the millions of old Cash. Julian, indeed, once
idolised by a set now dispersed and broken up,
was an outcast of humbled fortunes, who could
not even aspire to a seat in the Lower House;
whilst Eustatius had gradually conquered a
place in all men's estimation, by sheer weight
of metal, as it was said, and had risen to the
Lower House of T. T.'s, and from the Lower
House to the House of <i>Millionaires</i>&mdash;in fact,
from insignificance to importance, whilst Julian
had been declining from importance into insignificance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as they proceeded towards
their destination, the vanity of Julian was
gratified by the idea of showing this interloper
how well he stood in the good graces of his
fair cousin, and Eustatius took a malicious
pleasure in leading him to compromise himself
upon this subject, thereby to heighten the

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

mortification which discovery of the real purpose
of his visit would occasion&mdash;a discovery
by which the young <i>millionaire</i> proposed suddenly
to prostrate his rival, and to avenge
upon him so many former triumphs and indignities.
And in truth, nothing could be conceived
more incredibly astounding than an
explanation that the purpose of his visit was
a hurried marriage with the heiress of the
house of Lofty, with whom her cousin seemed
to believe that he would not even be allowed
an interview. Both the travellers were therefore
in high spirits. Towns, fields, and stations
seemed to fly rapidly past them, and at length
their carriages were landed upon <i>terra firma;</i>
and, with a bright sky and shining sun overhead,
they drove rapidly to the castle.</p>

<p>The avenue through which the horses galloped
was not in the best condition: the deep
ruts were filled with recent rain and mud, and
the footpath presented one series of little
pools.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

<p>Their attention was attracted as they drove
along by the somewhat slender figure of a man,
habited in professional black, and endeavouring
with the utmost care to pick his way amidst
the scanty patches of dry gravel on the path.
He appeared, indeed, to study with minute
interest, the hydrography of a whole system
of puddles&mdash;sometimes advancing his foot along
a narrow isthmus, or stepping on to a peninsula
or island, and then cautiously receding to
attempt a different passage. The garments
of this individual, which were rusty and threadbare,
were somewhat scanty. His coat cuffs
betrayed several inches of the wrist, and his
trousers too short and too tightly strapped
down, occasioned an almost ludicrous restraint
in his movements.</p>

<p>"What queer figures one does unearth from
holes and corners in the country," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Romeo and Juliet's apothecary, or a strolling
player all ready for the part," observed
his companion; and at this moment, as he

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

raised his glass to his eye to take a minute
survey of the stranger, the postillion urged his
horses, and the carriage-wheels sank splashing
into a deep rut, and covered the passer-by from
head to foot with mud.</p>

<p>There was something so comical in this
sudden and overwhelming frustration of the
hopes of an individual so assiduously bent on
traversing without spot or stain that very ill-conditioned
road, that Julian and his fellow-traveller
burst into a loud fit of laughter,
which, together with the rattling of the carriage-wheels,
drowned any exclamation which
the sufferer might have made.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," said Julian, at length, when
he had ceased laughing, "give him a lift in
one of your carriages."</p>

<p>"In his present condition," replied Eustatius&mdash;"what
would my people say to such a
proposal? No&mdash;I have no pity for a fellow of
that sort&mdash;his rusty black speaks volumes.
Why should one class be ever treading on the
heels of another? Why is he not in highlows

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

and fustian, and a smock frock?&mdash;he need not
then have picked his way so daintily."</p>

<p>As they turned the base of the hill the
castle rose majestically in view, and here again
the Lady Calliro&euml; became the subject of conversation.
"So because the senator is absent, you
think there is no chance of seeing your fair
cousin?"</p>

<p>"How should there be?" replied Julian,
"at least in the ordinary course of things.
She is not out, and therefore how could she
receive a stranger? but," he added, with some
fatuity, "I am one of the family you know,
and I will take care that you are not entirely
disappointed;&mdash;if I cannot obtain you admission
to her boudoir, you shall see her ride.
We always take a canter in the park in the
absence of old Lofty, a collation will be served
you in the oak rooms, and we will mount
under your window."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the lodge of
the park, which stretched invitingly before

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

them. Situated on an eminence, and admirably
drained, it was perfectly dry, and they
alighted. At this moment, the man in the
threadbare suit presented himself at the gate.
He had reached it at the same time as they,
because having been rendered reckless by his
accident, he had taken a short cut across the
brow of the hill, regardless of the wet and
mud in which he was now embrued to the
ankle, to say nothing of the stains yet undried
on the upper part of his garments. He was
sternly refused admission into the park by the
gatekeeper, on account of his appearance even
after having said something to the man in an
under tone, which somewhat mollified him, for
he replied more civilly, but quite as resolutely.</p>

<p>"It is more than my place is worth&mdash;besides,
if you reach the castle, I tell you that to-day
you cannot see him."</p>

<p>"This is hard, on a matter of life and death,"
said the stranger, about to turn away, when
Julian accosted him.</p>

<p>"They refuse you admission? then come

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

with me. It is through our fault that you are
in this disarray&mdash;we owe you some compensation.
Whom do you wish to see at the
castle?"</p>

<p>"The senator."</p>

<p>"The senator is absent," said Julian.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he is here," replied the stranger, and
the porter, by a respectful nod of the head,
corroborated his assertion. The nephew felt
a little disconcerted at this announcement, but
his word was passed, and he turned to his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I will introduce you into my uncle's
presence&mdash;follow me."</p>

<p>"I will <i>accompany</i> you," said the stranger,
resolutely and with emphasis, whereupon, the
son of the <i>millionaire</i>, for the first time, paused
to direct upon this personage a scrutinising
look, but he was met by a glance which made
him speedily withdraw his own&mdash;so full it was
of depth and determination, and of a disquieting
kind of haggardness which involuntarily troubled
him.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

<p>He then first perceived that this personage
was young, and bore about him that rare and
peculiar stamp which rendered all possible connexion
between him and the ridiculous, utterly
incompatible. Eustatius Cash passed his arm
into that of Julian, and they proceeded in
silence, the stranger not following, but accompanying
them, as he said, for he walked
in a parallel direction, a few paces distant
from their side.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE INTERVIEW.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> seneschal of the senator's household received
the new comers. He was a courteous
man of middle age, with all the discrimination
fitting to his office, whose duties, indeed, he
in everything was eminently calculated to fulfil,
even to the minute particulars of manner and
personal appearance.</p>

<p>One glance sufficed to show that he was as
peculiarly adapted to that baronial castle, once
a Ducal residence (of which he did the honours),

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

as the heron to its heronry, the falcon to its
mew, the snail to its shell, or the bird to its
nest.</p>

<p>He moved about amidst its long galleries
and gothic chambers with speech and bearing
half-courtly, half-chivalric, and his very features,
from their strong resemblance to the
coroneted portraits on the walls seemed to render
him a living impersonation of the statesmen,
warriors and dames, who frowned in dignity or
smiled in grace upon you from their canvas.
This likeness is not imaginary, because Hugh
Fitz-Stephen Upland (entitled to the Marquisate
of that name if his family had not in
his person outlived the abolition of these feudal
titles), is one of the last lineal descendants of
the former owners of the castle and domains
of Upland. He is said to regard this circumstance
with secret pride and satisfaction,
though possessing too much knowledge of the
world to treat with any thing but affected
pleasantry the old title by which he is sometimes

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

banteringly addressed, and which it
would be as absurd to assume at the present
day, as to have sported the style of Knight
of Malta, or Grand Prior, half a century since.
Statistics and fashion, indeed, have perhaps
had more share than other social causes in any
the change of feeling, which has caused society
to regard with so much contempt all pretensions
to family antiquity.</p>

<p>When, for instance, in England, statistics
proved that out of every hundred registered
voters, eighty-eight were descended from
William Rufus, or Edward the Crusader, and
ten more from the followers of William their
progenitor, the Herald's office would have been
exploded, and the Garter King-at-Arms might
never have pocketed another fee, if, from this
very circumstance, a fresh impetus had not ingeniously
been given to the thirst of distinction
natural to all ambitious races&mdash;for it is needless to
repeat what large sums are expended at the present
time to obtain from that very Herald's office

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

vouchers that a family is <i>not</i> descended from
the Norman Conqueror, or what fees are added
for authentication of the fact that a house is
so far distinguished from the vulgar herd as
<i>not</i> to have had an ancestor amongst the
Doomsday Barons. It is true that these
vouchers are now becoming so common even
in the Democratic Union, that in another
twenty years there will perhaps remain none
but the Papuans, the Hottentots, and the
inhabitants of Cochin China, who will not be
possessed of authentic proofs that they are
none of the Conqueror's seed, and none but
they who will consequently go down to posterity
as his descendants.</p>

<p>The seneschal, Hugh Fitz-Stephen Upland,
had received his cue, concerning Eustatius
Cash but with regard to the unexpected apparition
of Julian, he had no instructions, and at
any other time he would, without hesitation,
have courteously expulsed the seedy stranger,
but he had tact enough to discern that something

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

unusual was passing in that mansion, whose
proprieties he had never seen so singularly
violated during thirty years that he had presided
over his department. He had learned
or divined that there was, under that ostentatiously
ceremonious roof, a cabinet minister
incognito, a Bishop <i>in petto</i>, and an ex-Lord
Chancellor, who had alighted under the
disguise of a tartan shooting-jacket, and from
a branch-railway-omnibus-conveyance. He
had farther seen the Lady Calliro&euml; in tears&mdash;her
favourites impatiently set aside&mdash;her palfrey
dismissed without its customary lump of sugar&mdash;and
her father, the most dignified, and self-possessed
of men, plunged into such profound
abstraction that he had actually shaken hands
with the astonished groom of the chambers,
who came in white kid gloves, to present him
with a letter on the salver of jewelled gold,
subscribed by the faithful city of Moscow at
the coronation of that last of the Romanoffs,
whose birth-place is recorded now by a gigantic

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

knout of bronze on a granite pedestal,
adorned with alternate skulls and medallions of
brass, illustrative of the family murders of this
house, which are beautifully executed in relief
on this monument, doubly raised to the infamy
of that Imperial race, and to the folly
of preceding generations, which endured its
rule.</p>

<p>In this state of things, the seneschal felt so
much at sea that he hardly knew what course
to pursue, and doubtful whether the stranger
might or not be an authorised performer in
these singular proceedings. He consequently
begged them all to be seated. The son of the
<i>millionaire</i>, with a deference of which the
dignified formality was flatteringly respectful&mdash;the
unexpected Julian, with polite urbanity&mdash;and
the seedy stranger with a frank, off-handed
kind of hospitality. A moment's reflection
taught him however, that as regarded Eustatius
Cash, his instructions were definite; and
he therefore led him to the apartments prepared

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

for his reception, profiting by this opportunity
to learn the pleasure of the senator
respecting his nephew Julian.</p>

<p>Lord Lofty, on hearing of this unexpected
arrival, betrayed unusual indignation and impatience,
proceeding straightway into the
presence of the intruder. Nothing, he thought,
could be more impertinent than such a visit at
that particular crisis, and he consequently
resolved most unceremoniously to dismiss his
scapegrace relative.</p>

<p>"Julian," said the uncle, coldly, extending
two fingers in return for his nephew's
proffered hand&mdash;"this visit is unexpected; and,
notwithstanding the deep interest I take in
your welfare, I must plainly tell you, uncalled
for at such a moment."</p>

<p>"I should not have intruded," replied Julian,
somewhat crest-fallen, "if I had not accidentally
met with young Cash, an old acquaintance,
coming to pay you a flying visit. He
offered me a seat in his carriage, and I could

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

not resist the temptation of enquiring after
you and my fair cousin Calle."</p>

<p>"This is embarrassing," said the senator to
himself. "You are not then aware of the
object of that visit?"</p>

<p>"If it be political," answered Julian, "I
should grieve to prove any obstacle or interruption&mdash;and
in that case, I will not prolong my
stay&mdash;or I will repair to my cousin, whom I
have not yet greeted, without farther tax
upon your valuable time."</p>

<p>"Julian," said the senator, "the object of
that visit is at once political and more than
political; in one sense, indeed, it personally
interests yourself. For you, too, will be indirectly
and beneficially affected by the event
to which I am alluding. But whilst not unmindful
of your future, I must, at the same
time, frankly confess to you, that I consider it
a duty incumbent on me to mark my profound
regret at your neglected opportunities, and my
unqualified reprobation of your conduct, by

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

requesting that you will spare me the pain of
your presence at my daughter's marriage."</p>

<p>"At Calliro&euml;'s marriage!" exclaimed Julian,
who was flattering himself a moment
before that he should play an indispensable
part in that ceremony, whenever it took place.</p>

<p>"At my daughter's marriage," repeated the
senator. "A great alliance&mdash;she weds the
only son of the great millionary, Cash.</p>

<p>"Eustatius Cash!" ejaculated the staggered
Julian, who could hardly falter out&mdash;"when?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said the senator, "Sir Jasper
gives away the bride. The Bishop of Manchester
performs the nuptial ceremony; and
the civil authority will be represented&mdash;the
marriage contract overlooked, by the ex-chancellor,
Lord Besom and Variable.</p>

<p>Julian changed colour and fell back in his
chair, so overpowered by this astounding communication
as to be deprived of utterance.</p>

<p>At this moment the senator first perceived
that they were not alone, for his eye caught,

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

in the recess of a window, the pale, anxious features
of the stranger, contrasting so strikingly
with his patient and immoveable attitude.</p>

<p>"Who is your companion?" asked the host
of Julian, without averting his gaze from the
youth in black, who answered for his protector.</p>

<p>"One whom your nephew has helped into
your presence on an errand of life and death."</p>

<p>"What is your pleasure?" asked the senator,
looking in astonishment from Julian to
the mud bespattered stranger.</p>

<p>"Life is departing," replied the youth. "I
come to seek your aid."</p>

<p>"I am not the dispenser of life. Whom
am I addressing?"</p>

<p>"One of your own tenants."</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"I inhabit the last cottage on the Burnside
hill," replied the youth, evasively.</p>

<p>"Have I not got a steward?" said the senator,
and then he added, shortly, and as if some

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

circumstance suddenly recurred to his memory.
"Ha, I see&mdash;you are one of the people who
have squatted on my property. I can encourage no
tenants in the parish, who cannot
prove ostensible means of livelihood. You
are over bold to intrude into my presence.
What do you want with me, or from me?"</p>

<p>"For myself, nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Young man, go to my steward, or to my
almoner."</p>

<p>"It would be useless; it is to you, my lord,
that my request must be made. I come to
beg of you a bunch of grapes."</p>

<p>"This is strange;&mdash;and not a little presumptuous."</p>

<p>"I seek this favour for a dying man."</p>

<p>"I have no grapes, if I were disposed to
humour the fancies of all invalids, the crop
has failed here as everywhere."</p>

<p>"I have heard so from your gardener; but
I know from your gardener, too, that you have

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

preserved one magnificent bunch in your hot-house&mdash;let
me have that."</p>

<p>"A modest request, upon my honour!"</p>

<p>"I ask it not to gratify a caprice, but as a
remedy&mdash;a remedy by which a life may be
prolonged."</p>

<p>"And who tells you that a bunch of grapes
will prolong life?"</p>

<p>"Science."</p>

<p>"Are you a physician?"</p>

<p>"I am literally a physician; and appreciation
of the human frame is one branch of my knowledge."</p>

<p>"Then, my young doctor, you must study
more deeply before your word suffices to convince
me that health or life can depend on a
bunch of grapes."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said the stranger, "unless I
had that conviction, would I have besieged
your gate as I have done, subjecting myself to
mortification and refusal? and can you weigh

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

a bunch of grapes against even a chance of the
life of a fellow creature?"</p>

<p>"Enough," said the senator; "I refuse you
upon principle. Even if it were true that a
bunch of grapes&mdash;being a rarity for my table&mdash;could
save the life of a child of the people,
it would be not only a political inconsistency,
but an injustice towards its fellows, to give
that bunch of grapes; and I have too much
paternal love for the people to commit such an
injustice. Now mark me, young man, Providence, for its own inscrutable purposes, has
made a distinction between the poor and the
rich. In its all-wisdom the poor of to-day
are the rich of to-morrow; the rich of to-day
are poor; but whilst Providence allots to man a
state of poverty&mdash;in all countries and in all ages,
the bread of sorrow has been his portion. It
is our duty, and it should be our chiefest pleasure,
to alleviate his condition as far as practicable
without diminution of our own enjoyments;
but moral and economical considerations

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

fix this alike as the limit of such endeavours.
Now I am perfectly aware that in every
hamlet&mdash;in every factory&mdash;in every lane of
crowded cities, there linger innumerable
wretches, any one of whose individual lives
I might save by substituting rich diet, generous
wines, and wholesome air, for their
meagre fare and pestilential atmosphere.</p>

<p>"There are as many more on whom consumption
preys in the north, or panting in the
south for the bracing breezes of the north, whose
health I might restore, by costly transference
to a more congenial clime. I might, indeed,
benefit some hundreds, perhaps some thousands,
if I were to sacrifice the roof that covers me&mdash;the
lands that stretch around&mdash;the elegancies
which surround me; but these I should only
select invidiously to leave millions more to
perish; and how much more invidious then
would be an individual preference?"</p>

<p>"And if all your class were to contribute?"
asked the stranger. "Yet, my lord, I appeal

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

not to your reason, but to your heart. There
are cases in life where impulse only guides us&mdash;how
otherwise would the mother give her milk
to rear a child which she knows may prove ungrateful
and will certainly divide her scanty
morsel of bread? Nature, which has given the
mother milk, has implanted in the breast of man
a kindly feeling towards his fellows. To this
feeling I appeal. Give me that bunch of
grapes, of which the fruit cannot but taste bitter
on your table connected with the thought that
its price has been a human being's life."</p>

<p>"Impulse is for the people; forethought and
it may be pain for those who watch the fold,"
replied the senator; and then he added,
peremptorily, "enough. You have surprised this interview.
My time is precious, young man. You
have my answer;&mdash;may it prove a moral lesson."</p>

<p>"It <i>shall</i> prove a moral lesson," haughtily
replied the stranger, whose pride had all along
been ill-repressed by his solicitude. "When the
hour of reckoning comes&mdash;when the poor and

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

the oppressed are triumphing&mdash;when their only
impulse is hate of their oppressors&mdash;then they
shall listen only to that impulse and leave
to these oppressors pain and regret of the
irrecoverable past!"</p>

<p>"Come! Come!" said a groom of the
chambers, whom the senator had summoned,
to cut short the stranger's importunities,
hurrying him out, just as Julian
and the senator were startled by the sudden
intrusion of his daughter.</p>

<p>Julian's greyhounds, escaped from their leash,
had found their way to the Lady Calliro&euml;. On
inquiry she had learned that he was with her
father, and, knowing how irritating this circumstance
might prove&mdash;how painful the disclosure to Julian, of the event to which she
had consented&mdash;she forced her way into their
presence, and stood before them as the stranger
was led away and hurried to the castle gate
through rows of grinning lacqueys, who were
rapidly being marshalled in their state liveries
and holiday array.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE REJECTION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lady Calliro&euml; was pale and self-possessed,
though her compressed lip, the fevered animation of her glance, and the dilating veins,
showed that this external calm resulted from a
resolute and painful effort.</p>

<p>Her eyes met those of her cousin; but
neither spoke.</p>

<p>Julian felt then, as he had felt before, ready
to sink into the earth. Vexation, wounded
pride, and awe of the great personages&mdash;whose

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

sanction invested the astonishing event with so
much circumstance and pomp&mdash;still kept him
speechless. Julian, though reckless of his person,
and singularly daring in his sphere, was yet
little calculated for antagonism with overwhelming
superiority; and his demeanour
did not show to advantage when contrasted
even with the glance of hostility and defiance
with which the poor stranger returned the contemptuous
looks of that inhospitable household,
as he strode away.</p>

<p>"Calliro&euml;," said the senator, at length, "has
Sir Jasper left you?"</p>

<p>"Sir Jasper has left me&mdash;resigned to your
wishes; but I come to confess to you, my
father, that if you bartered my hand before
consulting me, I, your daughter, committed the
error of promising that hand without your
knowledge. None, but I, should announce the
violation of my promise; and I was writing
now to Julian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the father, directing a stern and

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

penetrating glance on Julian. "This, indeed
is new to me. My child, dismiss the memory
of such folly. Your affianced bridegroom is
beneath this roof; you must see the propriety
of retiring."</p>

<p>"Not so, my father. I obey you&mdash;I wed
another; but until then I will be my own
mistress. I have always been determined.
Imagine whether I am less so now, with so
brief a period of freedom before me. You must
leave me with Julian: he must unbind me
from my promise, or I will die unmarried."</p>

<p>"Julian must quit these walls at once. The
prosperity of our house depends on that marriage,
and in its prosperity our kinsman Julian
shall not be forgotten."</p>

<p>"It is true that I have my cousin's promise,"
said Julian, gaining courage, "though little
account is taken of a woman's heart when her
hand is made the subject of a bargain."</p>

<p>"Leave us," said the Lady Calliro&euml;, "alone
ten minutes and Julian shall quit us."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

<p>The senator hesitated, and then, knowing
his daughter's wilfulness, thought it best to put
an end to this painful scene by compliance.</p>

<p>When they were alone the senator's daughter
addressed her cousin bravely. "Julian, this
is a sad meeting&mdash;it was rash to come," and
then burst into tears.</p>

<p>"My own Calliro&euml;!" said Julian, in whose
mind the only defined sensations were pity and
admiration of the weeping girl, and a burning
wish to thwart and mortify his rival. "My
own Calliro&euml;. Thank Heaven you are not yet
another's. Be resolute as you are true&mdash;be
firm as you are beautiful, and we may yet be
happy."</p>

<p>He seized her hand and attempted to carry
it to his lips, but she pushed him back.</p>

<p>"I am not Myrrah!"</p>

<p>"Fiends!" said Julian, "they have poisoned
your mind against me."</p>

<p>"Heaven knows how truly, Julian; but be
this as it may, I have yielded to my fate."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

<p>"But that compliance you may still recall.
You are the inheritress of power and wealth&mdash;why
need you seek power or wealth in marriage?
Oh, my Calliro&euml;&mdash;my love&mdash;my own&mdash;it
is not too late;&mdash;be faithful to your vow,
and the future is our own."</p>

<p>"Not even the present," said the Lady
Calliro&euml;, shaking her head mournfully. "Listen
to me, Julian. All this has been as sudden
as a dream. At this time yesterday I may
have doubted of your truth, but I had no idea
of anything beyond. To-day I discover that
I am heiress only to a father's ruin. To-day,
statesmen and ministers track me to my boudoir,
making me the propitiatory offering for their
and his salvation. What would you have
had me do?"</p>

<p>"What did your heart dictate?" asked
Julian. "Did it not occur to you to share
poverty with <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Calliro&euml;&mdash;"I thought it
better to accept splendid misery&mdash;I thought of

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

my father's ruin&mdash;of yours Julian&mdash;I doubted
of your love&mdash;and I made your future a stipulation
of compliance. Sir Jasper offered at
last the vacant military secretaryship."</p>

<p>"My noble cousin!" said Julian, "it was
worthy of you; to speak frankly, yesterday I
loved you well, and for such a post&mdash;to be again
somebody and something&mdash;I would have removed
into another planet, but at this hour my
feeling is changed. You shall not be the sacrifice
to my fortune; fling back their gifts and offers
with disdain, and come to love and me."</p>

<p>"One moment," answered Calliro&euml;; "there
was a governor-generalship vacant&mdash;I demanded
it."</p>

<p>"It was madness!"</p>

<p>"So said the premier&mdash;but he yielded; there
was ruin in my refusal."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Julian.</p>

<p>"Yet true&mdash;as you shall hear from his own
lips. You are the governor-general of Japan,
the hour that sees me Lady Cash."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

<p>"I, governor-general!" exclaimed Julian.
"I! by common accord, condemned to an
eternally frivolous existence! I, whom they
have contemned, raised at one step immeasurably
above the heads of those who had toiled
past me whilst I was loitering to gather
flowers by the way&mdash;I, governor-general of
Japan!&mdash;but you refused, Calliro&euml;?"</p>

<p>"No, Julian&mdash;I accepted; I was about to
enclose your commission with my farewell&mdash;you
came in person&mdash;I have seen you&mdash;it was
better so&mdash;and now Heaven prosper you, Julian&mdash;for
we part for ever!"</p>

<p>Julian had fallen on one knee and kissed the
fair hand of his cousin&mdash;tears were in his eyes&mdash;thanks
on his lips&mdash;and a little scorn in hers,
for she heard no more of "Love in a Cottage."</p>

<p class="center">* * * *</p>

<p>As the Lady Calliro&euml; retired to her boudoir,
a letter was put into her hand; it ran,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Calliro&euml;</span>,</p>

<p>The political crisis I foreshadowed in my
last is arrived. I have reason to know, that
skilful as is Sir Jasper, our pilot, we cannot
weather the storm&mdash;it is indeed time for every one
to look out for a plank against the approaching
shipwreck. Do not forget, Julian, or it may
soon be too late&mdash;now or never, we must secure
for him some office which does not change
with the administration. Whilst thus urging
you, dearest Calliro&euml;, I hasten to correct an
error, into which, on reference to the copy of my
letter, I find that I had inadvertently fallen. I
asked your interest to obtain the military
secretaryship of Japan for Julian. This was
an absurdity&mdash;it could not be conferred upon
him; it is the <i>under</i>-secretaryship that I meant."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>, though elated with his success,
still felt painfully anxious. The bridegroom
was there, indeed, and he had the full authorisation
of the father to negotiate the marriage
in question, yet the father, without whose
signature nothing could be done, was not
arrived. The pressure of events was imminent,
the time of the minister incalculably valuable,
his occupations harassing and urgent, and yet
he could not venture to leave the castle till he

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

has seen this alliance sealed, on which depended
now the combinations of his policy. Even at
the eleventh hour his rivals might outbid him.
Old Cash, who did not hesitate to shock the
decorum of the senate by sitting in his shirt-sleeves,
was not the man to weigh even formalities
the most compromising against solid
interests.</p>

<p>"No tidings of him yet," said the minister,
reading rapidly the intelligence conveyed in
his own cipher by the electric telegraph, of
which a branch ran to the senator's residence.
"They are clamouring for me now at the private
meeting of our friends. The funds are going
down&mdash;once, twice, thrice, they have been
down within these two hours. Here are four-and-twenty
waverers absent through sickness&mdash;ah!
and traitors too amongst them&mdash;watched
to the levee of my rival. The owls fly out and
hoot, the rats and vermin quit their holes&mdash;there
are all the signs of a crumbling house,
and of a falling ministry."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

<p>Lord Lofty listened to the words which fell
from his patron's lips with deferential and
intense attention. He had followed where
that patron had led&mdash;he had moved forward
where he had pointed out the way&mdash;but, like
the Israelites in the desert, had despaired and
doubted in his heart, and cursed his stars, at
times, that he had not worshipped other Gods.
When, at length, there seemed nothing but
ruin and a waste before him&mdash;like Moses, who
miraculously drew the water from the rock&mdash;this
man of inexhaustible expedients came to
save him; snatching him from bankruptcy to
place him again on the pinnacle of prosperity.
The senator rejoiced, therefore, to see his
leader wear a smile of confidence, and asked,
more in wonderment than in doubt,</p>

<p>"But though the re-establishment of my
influence and the magnificent but tardy accession
of our party will give us majorities to-morrow,
and the next week and the next, how
shall we carry on the government beyond? Is

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

not the sense of the monarchies strong against
our order? Is not our order weakened, and is
not the impression abroad that its time is
come?"</p>

<p>"And that impression is full of truth&mdash;its
fate is sealed. No man can any more stem the
flood of circumstance than re-ascend the stream
of time; but the bold and skilful may float
with its tide and steer happily down its rapids.
I grant you that the rationalist party will be
a wreck before another session, but yet you
and I will be ministers."</p>

<p>The senator looked dubiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, farewell to the wreck of our estate;
we steered it gallantly and sailed it well; but
men like you and me are not made to perish
with it. The spirit of the time has changed&mdash;we
must move with the spirit of the time&mdash;we
must head the moderate party."</p>

<p>"Our deadly enemies!"</p>

<p>"I shall have followers from our camp, and

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

find partisans in theirs. I will not even ask
whether I may count on you."</p>

<p>"But how join them in the excitement of
the measures they press us with so hard&mdash;The
measures we have opposed so long and bitterly?"</p>

<p>"We do not join&mdash;we crush our enemies&mdash;we
raise a banner loftier than their own, and,
drawing after it their followers, leave the Moderate
leaders hostless. With all those devoted
to me&mdash;with all the party of old Cash to back
me&mdash;we go down to the senate and hurl upon
them, like a thunder-bolt, a proposition more
popular than they ever dreamed of. What
say you?"</p>

<p>"A bold and appalling step; but the master
mind reveals itself, and I defer," replied the

his chief.</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth, it will be to them appalling
in the hour of anticipated triumph when we
come upon them&mdash;sudden, resistless, unexpected&mdash;a

political avalanche. Still, I wish
this marriage were concluded&mdash;the contract
signed. Where is our new ally&mdash;why does he
tarry?" The minister looked again to his telegraph.</p>

<p>"A report spreads that the minister is ill.
The mob are cheering the Moderate members.&mdash;No;
it is the Moderate leader, who is ill and
absent."</p>

<p>"My friend, we must hasten this marriage,
every hour is precious."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to proceed till old Cash
arrives."</p>

<p>"Listen," said the minister, earnestly, "this
whole arrangement is so peculiar, that if events
have justified a precipitation thus far novel
and unusual, I cannot see why we should not
anticipate the event by a few hours. The
Lady Calliro&euml; will listen to reason, supposing
we further hasten the ceremony, and cause
it to take place within a short time of his
arrival."</p>

him to the bride&mdash;that we run through the
contract, and fix the marriage for midnight."</p>

up a darling child; but after all it is for her
incalculable advantage."</p>

powerful woman in the world."</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Eustatius</span> was left alone with his affianced.
When told by his father that he must marry,
he prepared to obey implicitly and without comment.
It was an agreeable surprise when he
found that the wife provided for him was
young, high-born, wealthy, and widely famed
for her beauty. He had, indeed, seen the Lady
Calliro&euml; on one of the few occasions on which
she had appeared in public, and&mdash;like all the
world&mdash;often, in graceful portraits and the
prints of boudoir books.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; had never seen Eustatius.
When Sir Jasper was gone she had given one
glance at his miniature, and had almost experienced
a feeling of disappointment, when,
enthusiastically bent on self-sacrifice, she found
that he was so comely. This feeling was
heightened when he stood before her, and that
she was forced to acknowledge that his portrait
had not done him justice.</p>

<p>"Our position is a strange one, Lady Calliro&euml;"
he said at length, "the sport, as we are
of social and political exigencies, which roll
remorselessly over our predilections and affections.
How then shall I describe to you my
delight when being deprived of all free will&mdash;when
yielding blindly to my fate, I find a
choice made for me exactly where I should
have paused to admire and render homage, if
I had ranged the wide world through."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Lady Calliro&euml;, "we are
two puppets in the hands of those who play
us off. We have each, no doubt, our part

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

assigned to us&mdash;but why weary each other
with it?"</p>

<p>The suitor looked annoyed for a moment,
and then he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Something similar I must have said, if you
had been like the old fairies in the nursery
tale instead of resembling the imprisoned beauties
whom gallant knights deliver. Yet why
doubt truth when more probable than insincerity?
One glance at your mirror will prove
that you are beautiful; one glance into your
eyes will prove them full of soul&mdash;the sound
of your own voice&mdash;the reflection of your own
person, must teach you better than the tongue
of man, that you are formed to inspire love in
his bosom. I do not for a moment dream that
one tithe of that impression can be mutual;
but I am sure that I shall love you tenderly,
and believe me, that a woman cannot be so
loved and remain for ever indifferent."</p>

<p>"You have learned your lesson well," said
the Lady Calliro&euml;, "but let us rather strive

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

to be friends, since we are to be partners
through life. They have chosen for you a wife
very self-willed."</p>

<p>"What matter" replied Eustatius, with a
smile, "when she finds a husband who will
have no will but hers?"</p>

<p>"That is a consideration in the price of a
wife, where a wife is purchased, for we have
as much will in this matter as the thing bought
and sold by the trader."</p>

<p>"If it be too distasteful to you?" said Eustatius,
who was growing embarrassed, "yet Sir
Jasper said that you were not unwilling."</p>

<p>"I am resigned, as you must needs be in
this bargain."</p>

<p>"Madam, the mode of this marriage is the
curse of our position&mdash;yet in substance it will
prove, I trust, the blessing of our lives&mdash;the
glory and the pride at least of mine. You
must consider that formerly, when Princes
ruled, their children were disposed of as your
hand has been to me. They were bought and

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

sold, but the price was provinces and kingdoms.
The age of Princes is passed away. We replace
them, and this reminds me that I have an offering
to make."</p>

<p>The bridegroom went to the door, and two
of the Lady Calliro&euml;'s women entered with a
casket of malachite and gold.</p>

<p>"These jewels are unworthy of you&mdash;but I
believe there are few finer&mdash;all are historically
curious. This emerald adorned the Sultan's
turban; this pearl was pledged by Charles
the Second to the States of Holland; this
brilliant the Empress Catherine purchased by
a title and pension; this gem belonged
to Mary, Queen of Scots; for this ruby
a pitched battle was fought, a province desolated."</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; took them one by one,
and cast them carelessly aside.</p>

<p>"This necklace, if you examine it minutely
through your glass, contains on each stone,
exquisitely graven views, of seven once royal

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

palaces; this is Sans Souci&mdash;this is Fontainebleau.
My father purchased the domains with
the necklace from their owner&mdash;they go together&mdash;they
are part of my offering."</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; exhibited no surprise at
the Imperial magnificence of these presents.</p>

<p>"Jewels and palaces! It is well; you are
colossally rich, I know, but how inhabit more
than one dwelling, wear more than one of these
suits at a time?"</p>

<p>"Yet these are things that the beautiful and
high-born covet."</p>

<p>"I loved jewels yesterday, but not to-day.
When it suits man's purpose he appeals to woman's
reason&mdash;suppresses the inspirations of a
woman's nature&mdash;he leaves out of consideration
her hopes, her delicacy, her antipathies, her
predilections&mdash;and then, when she has taken an
irretrievable step into the path he wishes, he
would make her the woman and the child again.
These are the signs of wealth, and of power

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

which wealth purchases, but they are not
power. I do not exactly know all that constitutes
power; but votes in the National Parliaments&mdash;votes
in the Federative Assembly,
teeming populations and devoted clients are
evidence of power, I know; and these, for my
husband and myself, I prefer to gems and
palaces. What is your offering of these?"</p>

<p>Eustatius felt cruelly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You are wise and prudent as you are
beautiful. I am an only son&mdash;I have nothing
but the prospective inheritance of my father's
wealth&mdash;its extent is great&mdash;I do not precisely
know it&mdash;it would be difficult, they tell me, to
compute. These jewels are the richest in the
united monarchies&mdash;the other particulars of
our fortune correspond."</p>

<p>"Enough," said the Lady Calliro&euml;. "We
are yet but two automatons, whom others move&mdash;a
boy and a girl, who do as they are bid.
You were instructed to see and compliment
me&mdash;you have done so; I was told to receive

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

you&mdash;I have fulfilled my part. Now, take my
assurance, that I will be to you a faithful wife,
and allow me to retire."</p>

<p>"And I will be a loving husband," said the
bridegroom, seizing, with a show of eagerness,
and carrying to his lips, her hand, which she
made no hasty effort to withdraw, but which
was cold as marble.</p>

<p>"Will you promise me that it will not rain
at noon to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Not rain! How can I promise you?"</p>

<p>"How can you promise then to love me?&mdash;the
signs of the skies are easy to be read, compared
with the mind or temperament of man
or woman. No, if we are to be yoked together
through our lives, do not let us begin with
falsehood and deceit&mdash;we may come to that too
soon. Adieu, till we meet again."</p>

<p>And with this the Lady Calliro&euml; rose, and
left the disconcerted Eustatius, saying to himself,</p>

<p>"This is a girl! What will she be when a
great lady and a wife?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">ADIEU TO GIRLHOOD.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lady Calliro&euml; stood in the centre of her
boudoir, surrounded by her favourite women.
The opened doors showed through on either side
a long suite of apartments, in which presses,
chiffoniers, and caskets of carved wood, ivory,
ebony, or tortoise-shell, were opened too and
rifled of their contents&mdash;the treasures of a
wealthy maiden's wardrobe.</p>

<p>She had dismissed, from her service, all her
attendants who were weeping round her as she
divided amongst them her trinkets and her

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

raiment, as these were piled into a heap at her
feet. Here a Hindoo woman beat her breast,
and uttered loud lamentations as she gathered
up costly shawls and glittering trinkets&mdash;there
her faithful Highland girl collected the gold
coins, which she called the siller. A dark-eyed
Florentine, appealing to the virgin, took
nothing but a jewelled crucifix; and the Greek
maid, Zo&euml;, prostrated on the ground, disdaining
all these gifts, declared, in the accents of her
passionate grief, that she would not go away.
All kissed the hands or garments of their mistress,
and implored that she would not dismiss
them, but their mistress was inexorable. She
<i>would</i> be left alone&mdash;she was obeyed.</p>

<p>Even to Zo&euml; she was almost harsh, though
she kissed her on the forehead, and gave the
weeping girl her dear gazelle, the only token
the devoted islander would accept.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; then hastened to take a
last look at her palfrey. She bade them take
off his bridle, and loose him in the park. The

<!-- vol 1 page 136 -->

horse came up at her well-known voice&mdash;he
neighed his recognition&mdash;but, in a moment,
finding he was loose, he galloped off, describing
circles round her, till at last, exulting
in his freedom and his swiftness, he snuffed the
breeze and sped away.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; watched him, until&mdash;lost
amongst the old oak trees&mdash;his mane and tail
were only seen at intervals, flashing in silver,
above the fern, amidst which he disappeared,
startling the deer in his impetuous career.
She then called for her falcons, Timur and
Attila. She ordered them to remove their
hoods, unbind their jesses, and let them soar.</p>

<p>The hawks, no more faithful than the steed,
flew away&mdash;one out of sight, and then the
other followed in his track through the clear
atmosphere, till both were hidden by the tall
trees.</p>

<p>She returned to her boudoir to take a last
look at her flowers, and at her birds. In
bright and uniform, or blended hues of purple,

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

azure, gold and scarlet, now mingled like
the rainbow's tints, now varying with every
movement and with each reflected beam, as
they fluttered from flower to flower, or hung
with vibrating wings suspended in the air, the
captives attracted by the sun without, beat
their gorgeous breasts against the crystal that
imprisoned them.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; touched a spring, and
the windows slid open. It was the impulse of
the moment, for an instant's reflection taught
her that she was wrong&mdash;but it was too late&mdash;she
could not close the casement readily, and
one by one her birds flew past her out, and she
remained alone.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">CHAPTER OF HISTORICO-POLITICAL ECONOMY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dread</span> of the wild communistic doctrines
triumphant in the Democratic Union, had
united by a common bond all in the Federative
Monarchies, who had property to lose, or the
hope of ever acquiring any.</p>

<p>The last prejudices of caste&mdash;the last vestiges
of lingering nationalities were dispersed by the
common danger, when the propagandist spirit
of this society began to manifest itself, threatening,

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

through its restless energy, the existence
of the old.</p>

<p>Recollections of a common origin and language
no longer bound nations together. A
Frenchman was no longer a Frenchman, an
Englishman no longer an Englishman; but
all merged into one of two great classes, into
which the civilised world became divided.
One consisted of those who had accumulated
property, or who, though not possessing any,
looked forward to its acquisition and could
appreciate institutions which maintained the
rights of individual possession, and of a large
number still influenced by custom or timidity.
The other comprised all who were content
to forego the prospect of opulence&mdash;with
the accompanying chance of misery&mdash;for the certainty
of competence, and who preferred a
humble equality, where none could overtop
them, to the possibility of social pre-eminence.
Thus the civilised world came to be separated
into two great states, in each of which the

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

disjointed fragments of castes and nations
were mingled and amalgamated into a mass&mdash;homogenous&mdash;though
its original elements
were still as distinguishable to the eye of investigation
as the antediluvian remains of
animals and vegetables assimilated by fossilization
with the strata in which they are found
embedded.</p>

<p>In the United Monarchies especially, forms
and styles, remained, though changed in essence.
National Chambers, Parliaments, and
Diets existed still, but altered in constitution
and dwindled down to local importance.</p>

<p>Lords, Counts, and Peers survived in name
but not in substance; and the forms of hereditary
monarchies were still preserved in the
former subdivisions of the Federative Kingdoms,
though royalty had really sunk into
a mere state of beadledom.</p>

<p>These Federative Monarchies formed of so
many elements of wealth, constituted naturally
the most powerful of the three great states, into
which (with the Bokarian despotism) the whole

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

world was divided. It was the most peaceable
as well as the most powerful, and could only
be roused by the determined aggression of
the Democratic Union to defend itself in the
sanguinary struggle which ensued between
them.</p>

<p>In this struggle, as all the world knows, the
wealth and organisation of the Federative
Monarchies triumphed, and the Union, humbled,
weakened, and threatened in its very existence,
was obliged for many years to refrain from
further molestation.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this struggle the
capitalists became classed into two grades of
aristocracy, and wealth became the exact standard
of representation land of power. All
possessed of more than ten thousand pounds
voted in one chamber; the fortunate owners of
a million in another.</p>

<p>At first these major and minor capitalists
formed one united body against the Democratic
Union without, and their own penniless

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

fellow subjects within; but on the fortunate
issue of the war, the great capitalists divided
into two orders&mdash;the millionaries and the
many-millioned; and by degrees found themselves
in opposition with the minor capitalists,
whom they attempted to keep down. These
parties assumed the name of Rationalists and
Moderates, and through their dissensions, the
sons of toil, whose sympathies were in a great
measure with the foreign Democratic Union,
were again enabled to raise their heads, under
the name of <i>Commonsense men</i>.</p>

<p>Rationalists and Moderates were equally
opposed to the Common-sense men, in this
respect, that they estimated the claims of that
accumulated labour, called capital, so high above
those of living labour as to render the rights of
the one the wrongs of the other. Amongst themselves
they differed on its influential proportions,
and in the quarrel which ensued not
unfrequently coquetted with their common
adversaries.</p>

<p>For thirty years after the great struggle the

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

rationalists kept the ascendancy. The millionaries
indeed might have succumbed to the
numbers of their adversaries, but for the fact
that every minor capitalist lived in the hope
of becoming himself a millocrat, and that they
passed a law limiting every public association
to a hundred members. It thus happened that
every great undertaking fell naturally into the
hands of the rationalist millionaries, because,
notwithstanding the aggregate wealth of the
moderates, the limitation of number left
them no chance of rivalry.</p>

<p>But this powerful body, like many others,
not contented with present stability, sought to
extend both the amount and duration of its
power.</p>

<p>It chanced that a disease spread amongst all
roots and breadstuffs, like that which banished
the solanum tuberosum* from use, in the middle
of the last century. It went through different
phases; sometimes it increased&mdash;sometimes it

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

diminished, and at others seemed vanishing to
break out the next harvest with fresh violence.</p>

<p class="small">[*Called also murphy or potatoe in the speeches
and writings of that day.]</p>

<p>Famine for a long time threatened humanity,
till science discovered a means of neutralising
the effects of the contagion by a peculiar preparation
of the seed. This preparation required
several seasons, and in the different
stages of the disease, varying agents to destroy
the pernicious principle; but the process by
which these agents were employed, always the
same, had been indirectly secured by patents to
the principal millionaries.</p>

<p>It thus appeared inevitable that the dependence
of society for the chief article of its
food upon these potentates, must have
eventually placed at their mercy all classes of
their fellow citizens. This combination which
Sir Jasper had devised, was long successful.
The millocrats, like Pharaoh in the land of
Egypt, hoarded up the seed corn, and all were
obliged to purchase of them. So that being
the absolute lords of the staff of life, they

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

would have been enabled to tax, the remainder
of the people, without other limit than their
ability to pay, if it had not happened that the
wealth which flowed into the coffers of the millionaries
on one side had always ebbed out at
another. When the corn had been stored
for several years, it always chanced that some
one of the ever changing ingredients of disinfection
had been bought up by some equally
remorseless speculator, who levied on them
a larger toll than they were levying on the
people.</p>

<p>To retrieve such coincident mishaps the
millionaries speculated more deeply, but
never in a new stage of the disease did they
discover a modification of the remedy, but
that they had been forestalled, and were
obliged to purchase at ruinous prices the chief
ingredient of their disinfecting process. They
raised their prices; but this both occasioned
dangerous discontent and soon found its limit.
They were forced to give vast credit, and their

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

irresponsible debtors failed, whilst their wealth
was inexorably mulcted by their creditor.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the star of the
rationalist millocrats was waning fast, notwithstanding
all the expedients of Sir Jasper.
The moderates, backed by the people, hourly
gained strength and clamoured for the abolition
of the law which limited the numerical extent
of association.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, a personage had sprung
up, who had become in himself a power. No
man could be more solicitous to hide&mdash;more
skilful in concealing the amount of the money
he had made, but yet it became known that he
was the possessor of incalculable wealth, and
at different intervals chance had revealed riches
far exceeding the wildest speculations of the
vulgar.</p>

<p>The extent of his fortune gave him accession
to the body of the millionaries; but he in nowise
identified himself with their order. Though
without any ostensible effort on his part to

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

unite them, clients, partisans and imitators
gathered round him, expressing their eagerness
to vote as he voted, and following his example
by remaining strictly neutral.</p>

<p>Both the Rationalists under Sir Jasper and
the Moderates under Middleman Cautious had
in vain used every effort to gain him over
to their respective parties, till a period arrived
when John Cash, who refused to express even
the shadow of an opinion, obviously possessed
the power of inclining the balance either way.</p>

<p>At length, as the reader has been shown, Sir
Jasper flattered himself that he had succeeded
in attaching to his fortunes this man, who
epitomised a whole host in his person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the moderate leader indulges in
a like belief. Let us take a peep into his
camp.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious is walking up and
down a long room, at one end of which he
pauses to whisper orders or make suggestions
to a secretary whose pen travels over the paper

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

with marvellous rapidity, and then apparently
reflecting as he moves along, he comes to converse
in a subdued and earnest tone with a
group of politicians to whom he is giving audience
at the other end.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious, is, in point of years,
in the prime of life. His bald forehead is high
and broad. His eye, wonderfully piercing, is
a truthful index of his singular penetration,
which an insatiable curiosity excites, and to
which an inexhaustible patience ministers.
Years back he would probably have been a
rationalist notability if he could, but thrown
by circumstances, into the moderate party, he
became its leader, till at length, though aware of
its comparative insignificance, he began, like
C&aelig;sar, to prefer playing the first part in a
hamlet, to being second at Rome.</p>

<p>This party had, however, progressed from
weakness and inferiority to equality and
strength, and it was now rapidly assuming predominance.
If its chief had never ventured

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

upon one combination for the future, or created
one of the circumstances which favoured its development,
he had dissected and laid bare
the combinations of his adversaries, and profited
unerringly by every circumstance which arose.
He had inspired his party with courage when
it wanted heart, he had restrained its rashness
when it grew impatient, till at last it became
the fashion to reproach him with over prudence.
The announcement, therefore, of a decisive
and definite attack upon the rationalists produced
an immense sensation, and it was in the
midst of the excitement occasioned by this
intelligence, on the eve of the approaching
battle, that we have introduced him to the
reader.</p>

<p>"Those who are not with us to-morrow,
my lords, I shall consider against us. Let us
understand each other," said the Moderate
leader, addressing himself to five individuals
who tacitly allowed themselves to be represented

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

by one spokesman, and who were the waverers
spoken of by Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>"Let us, as you say, briefly understand each
other," replied the man addressed; "our absence
may be remarked&mdash;it is dangerous. That we are
animated by liberal sympathies and personal
friendliness of feeling is obvious by our being
here, but we have a great stake in the country,
Sir&mdash;we cannot compromise ourselves rashly,
and without seeing our way clearly. It will
be a toss up between you and Sir Jasper if you
bring in that bill to-morrow, without the aid of
Cash and his tail. They have never yet taken
any side, and unless we have some more positive
proof that they mean to join you, than your
mere assurance that they will co-operate, we
owe it to ourselves to step back into the rationalist
ranks which, after all, have been for
thirty years triumphant."</p>

<p>"We are full of sympathy with the masses,"
added one of the waverers, "but, as practical

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

men, we conceive that we can serve our
country better in that party, unless its strength
be shaken, and of this we must have some better
security."</p>

<p>"You are patriotic men, I know&mdash;who feel
it a duty to vote with the strongest," replied
Middleman Cautious; "I have pledged myself
to you, that John Cash has promised me his
support. You are not satisfied with that promise;
I now declare to you, always under seal
of secrecy, that to me it is perfectly satisfactory.
To-morrow will decide the matter. You
wish to side with the strongest&mdash;his support
will render me the strongest&mdash;reserve your
votes, therefore, till his party has pronounced
itself. If I be myself deceived, you will not
then be compromised. Can I give you better
security of my good faith?</p>

<p>The deserters looked at each other, and consented
with a common accord,</p>

<p>"It is then agreed, that directly the neutrals

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

have pronounced for us in the senate, you show
our colours, and vote with us."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" replied the spokesman. "It
would have a better effect for us to be
prepared with effective speeches the moment
Cash has pronounced himself, so as not
to follow at the tail of all his party. On that
eventuality depends in fact our concurrence."</p>

<p>"We part on that understanding," said
Middleman Cautious, shaking each man by the
hand. "If old Cash does not come forward,
you may have speeches ready to use the other
way, if you choose it."</p>

<p>"It would, indeed, disarm suspicion," replied
the spokesman, "and render our cooperation
more valuable, on some more auspicious
occasion. Good day;&mdash;success attend
your plans."</p>

<p>"God speed you, my lords," and the
waverers, after each one had grasped his hand
convulsively, retired.</p>

<p>"Is it then true that you really depend upon

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

Cash?" exclaimed, in utter dismay, Dick
Tystem, the Editor of the <i>Moderate Organ</i>,
and chief confident of the Partisan leader.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> depend upon him&mdash;I <i>do</i> trust implicitly
to his co-operation in the approaching struggle,"
replied Middleman Cautious. "We
might perhaps have conquered without him,
but time was fighting our battles, and I
would never have risked the strife or have
precipitated this decisive blow without his aid.
John Cash is the man of the age&mdash;his aid is
worth that of a hundred such auxiliaries as
the mob orator, Invective Rabid, who has just
left us, or of those vacillating traitors. Political
investigation led me to the suspicion, years
ago, that John Cash had possessed himself
mysteriously of the mainsprings of all social
change, and I have made John Cash the object
of my unceasing study. You know him to be
the very god of wealth&mdash;but perhaps you did
not suspect that he is what I have discovered
him to be&mdash;a Genius; a man whom it is impossible

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

to cajole, to intimidate, to touch, to tempt,
or to win over, and who was moving on with
rapid, though unpretentious strides, to the
absolute dominion of the State. But every
man has a heel previous to the arrow.</p>

<p>This vulnerable point I discovered in tracing
his extraordinary influence to its occult source.
John Cash has alone possessed the art of arresting
the vegetable pestilence. It is he
who, under innumerable forms, has drained
from the <i>Millionaries</i> what they extorted
from the people, but I have found the
talisman of his obedience&mdash;John Cash, with
all his wealth, and all his power, is at this
hour as completely under my control, as the
slave of the lamp at the disposal of Aladdin.
This fact has indeed determined me to change
the Fabian tactics of my party for a sudden and
decisive onslaught. To-morrow I bring in my
bill for the abolition of restricted association;
to-morrow I shall triumph through the aid of
this Prince of Gold. He must obey me; he

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

is but a puppet of which I hold the strings in
my hand&mdash;and what a puppet!&mdash;for, so to say,
he has the world in his."</p>

<p>The reader will thus perceive, that, at the
same hour, the leaders of the two chief parties
exulted on confident conviction of the
fidelity of their ally. Which was he deceiving?</p>

the incognito of the illustrious stranger.</p>

<p>Train after train had come up, when he was
telegraphed back to the castle, by the intelligence
that old Cash, eluding his vigilance and
civilities, had arrived before him.</p>

<p>Old Cash had come by a third class train,
and he had started for the castle on foot.

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

What cared he how he travelled?&mdash;for that
railway really belonged to him, or at least it was
mortgaged to him by one of those companies
of <i>millorats</i> who had appropriated steamboats
and railways and every means of conveyance
throughout the Federative Monarchies.</p>

<p>John Cash was at first refused admittance,
but his name acted like an "open sesame."
Doors were flung wide with ceremonious
eagerness&mdash;giants in livery bowed low and
humbly before the little man&mdash;and Hugh Fitz-Stephen
Upland, the seneschal was down upon
him with all the celerity of a spaniel rushing
to lick its master's feet.</p>

<p>Old Cash, as he called himself, was sixty
years of age, and short of stature. Nothing
could be more repulsive, or underbred, than his
appearance. His forehead was low&mdash;his rheumy
eyes of a greenish grey&mdash;his features coarse
and fleshy, and his skin oily in its Esquimaux-like
thickness. His broad stunted figure looked
still more unshapely beneath a heap of ill-fashioned

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

clothes, and his voice was singularly
harsh and unpleasing.</p>

<p>This unprepossessing individual did not even
speak any language distinctly. His conversation
was at best a singular medley of the
idiom, accent and words of many tongues, and
of the phraseology of many classes. He had
learned to sign his name, but no one had ever
seen him write further and, indeed, it was
still doubtful whether he could read at all.</p>

<p>These deficiencies, had long induced the
belief that he was both wanting in capacity
and ignorant; but the world was as much
mistaken in this opinion as the clowns who
sneer at some intelligent traveller who cannot
speak with fluency their village jargon.</p>

<p>Though a physiognomist might have accounted
his expression common-place and stolid, a phrenologist
would have contemplated with a very
different eye the vast development of brain,
none the less evidenced by the form and proportions
of his capacious skull, because all

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

further index of intellect was outwardly denied.
Though Cash could neither read nor write,
he possessed a degree and bent of genius which
rendered these arts useless to him. He could
dispense with reading and writing in the same
manner that he managed his extraordinary
speculations, without confidant or <i>locum tenens</i>&mdash;through
his prodigious memory and the wonderful
clearness of his head for figures and combinations.
For years he had been seen in marts
and on exchanges, transacting the most complicated
business entirely by word of mouth, and
without reference to any other memoranda
than such as were furnished by that faithful
monitor.</p>

<p>It is as a substitute for memory that three
parts of the utility of numbers and of letters
exists, and he was enabled to dispense with
their use through the singular vigour of his
retentive faculties.</p>

<p>As he had no trust in notes or books, every

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

fact or figure that he thought worth remembering
was engraven on his recollection, so
that far from being ignorant he was possessed
of an astonishing amount of that kind of miscellaneous
knowledge which is commonly
termed "information."</p>

<p>He would not trouble himself to retain anything
disconnected with the present state of
society, whether science, history, or art, because
he sought only to know mankind as it
was, and this he had gathered as much as possible
from extensive travel and unwearying observation,
making others read to him where
this had failed to enlighten him.</p>

<p>John Cash, though he could neither read
nor write&mdash;though he had never heard of the
siege of Troy, and was profoundly ignorant of
the planetary system, had in fact become the
most learned man of his time; that is to say,
if learning simply imply amount of knowledge.</p>

<p>No man living was so deeply versed in the

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

statistics of the world&mdash;of its surface and
inhabitants, and of the classes and races into
which these were divided.</p>

<p>No man was as completely master of its
political and financial secrets, and of the
strength, spirit and condition of the governing
and the governed.</p>

<p>Supposed to be a native of the Bokarian
despotism, though his origin was avowedly
obscure, he had risen so gradually and
unobtrusively that it became difficult to trace
back his career to the lowest step from which
he had ascended.</p>

<p>Some remembered this man&mdash;at whose bidding
the funds now rose and fell, and now notoriously
influenced peace and war&mdash;always as a
capitalist; others, whose memory stretched
beyond, recognised in him a mere humble
speculator, who was formerly whispered to be
richer than he appeared; whilst a few recalled
the peddling trader in the mighty lord of
millions, who was every day discovered to be

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

the owner of fresh and unsuspected sources
of wealth, and whose invisible agents seemed
like a net-work to overspread the globe.</p>

<p>Old Cash entirely eschewed the dignified
magnificence of his fellow millionaires, amongst
whom he had never yet chosen to take his
seat; but his affected humility&mdash;besides rendering
him popular&mdash;was really full of pride.</p>

<p>As far as he ever allowed his feelings to influence
his actions, which was until the point
where they interfered with his interests, there
lurked a feeling of profound resentment
against the class of which he had virtually
become a member. He had not forgotten the
trials of his early and humble life, and
now that his equality was incontestible, and
his superiority widely recognised, he took
pleasure in mortifying those who were once
his betters, by affecting all the coarseness of
those from whom he had sprung.</p>

<p>He loved to scandalise the ceremonious aristocracy
of the day, by the incongruities of his

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

costume or behaviour; and he found it sweet
to sin, by rude vulgarity of phrase, against
the proprieties of the drawing-room, which
dared not banish him from its precincts, just as
he took delight in defiling with the mud
of his plebeian highlows the velvet carpets
which he trampled.</p>

<p>Old Cash had started in life as an itinerant
vendor of rhubarb, roots, and sponges. This business
he abandoned for a stationary trade in marine
stores, or in other words, as a dealer in rags,
bones, and bottles. This shop was in its turn
abandoned for a less ostensible mode of speculation,
and from this period his fortunes rose
in a manner inexplicable to the world at large.</p>

<p>John Cash in reality united all the boldness
of Ouvrard with more than the cautious hardihood
and good luck of Rothchild. No scheme
was ever framed so daring and ingenious that
he could not have bettered it; but if he
knew how to convert a few thousand pounds
into millions he knew how to secure and

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

handle millions without the unnecessary loss or
risk of an infinitesimal fraction of their value.</p>

<p>The celebrated Poyais scheme held somewhere
betwixt 1820 and 1830 an historical
place between the Mississippi and South Sea
bubbles of a preceding century, and the railway
mania of 1846.</p>

<p>A knot of speculators devised the ingenious
expedient of hoaxing, with accounts of an
imaginary nation and territory, a royal personage&mdash;of
course it was a Bourbon&mdash;a Prime
Minister of France, and a whole public, which
need not be mentioned as the British. They
caused maps to be engraven, and books of
travel to be written by authors who contradicted
each other in a few details, to agree in
main particulars, respecting an El Dorado,
whose primitive inhabitants longed only for
some foreign people, to share with them their
riches&mdash;for a constitutional sovereign to rule
over them&mdash;for a colony of officials to fill
their vacant offices&mdash;and for a loan. Nobody

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

could contradict these writers;&mdash;no one else
had ever been there, for the best of reasons.
Each dupe was served to his taste. The Bourbons
furnished a sovereign in the person of
Don Francisco de Paulo; France found commanders-in-chief
and aides-de-camp, and John
Bull was gratified by permission to supply the
loan.</p>

<p>When all was arranged to the general satisfaction,
unluckily no one could discover this
populous country, which was at length conjectured
to be a facetious allusion, on the part
of the originators of the loan and constitution,
to a wide district of that name, inhabited by
bull frogs and alligators, and covered in the
day season with two feet of water.</p>

<p>John Cash had carried out, unaided, a
scheme quite as ingenious, and of which, furthermore,
he only secured the profits, whilst
keeping personally out of sight and obloquy.
He was already a capitalist when he judged it
adviseable to make large purchases of diamonds.
Once having come to this determination,

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

"nothing," he argued, "would be fairer than
to buy them at the lowest price." From time
immemorial bears on the Stock Exchange had
resorted, for the purpose of lowering the funds,
to every species of report which might cause
their prices to decline.</p>

<p>John Cash did not speak evil of the intent
or conduct of ministers and governments, nor
alarm the public confidence by the insidious
announcement of imaginary mishaps; he only
slandered brilliants, and spread the rumour
that they were worthless common stones.</p>

<p>A learned professor lectured publicly upon
the diamond, "long known," he said, "as pure
carbon, and which scientific men had now discovered
the means of crystalising in any quantity,
at an expense little exceeding its weight in
charcoal. A patent," added the learned Doctor,
"is being taken out for the manufacture of vases,
vessels, and window-panes of this once precious
and most durable material; and, indeed, I am
authorised to state that a company will shortly

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

open extensive premises, where orders will be
received and duly attended to. Price, as a
matter of science, is immaterial; but it is
gratifying for me to be able to inform my
hearers, that the cost of a diamond, the size of
a brickbat will not more than four times exceed
it in value. The mere manufacture of the material
was the first step&mdash;the second, and most
important, has been its fusion into useful forms,
and this object is nearly attained. I will, however,
herewith submit a few specimens for
your inspection," and so saying, the lecturer
took handfuls of brilliants from a canvas bag
beside him, and distributed them amongst the
spectators. "These are, as it were, but a sort
of diamond gravel&mdash;the fruit of our first crude
attempts, but though small, they are, as you will
perceive, of fine water. The contents of this
bag, with which we may now afford to scatter
our garden footpaths, would itself have been
worth a hundred thousand pounds at the previous
market price. You need not trouble

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

yourselves to return them, gentlemen, they
are valueless now." Men of science and
jewellers examined the stones with doubt or
incredulity&mdash;they were found to be perfect and
real diamonds, and his auditory, themselves
convinced, carried about conviction with the
specimens of the lecturer.</p>

<p>Far and wide spread the report&mdash;it was
printed, it was written, it was borne by word
of mouth, it was authenticated, and all over
the united monarchies the possessors of brilliants
hurried with them for sale, still glad to
get something above the value of the settings.
In every town and district some old sober-sided
purchaser of reversions and contingencies was
found, still willing to buy them for a trifle.
These individuals were the agents of old Cash,
who, by presenting the public with one bag of
brilliants, was enabled to secure all the finest in
the world for a mere song.</p>

<p>Let us now imagine a man of such speculative
boldness and unscrupulous ingenuity, suddenly

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

possessed of a secret which made him
Lord of the bread of nations, but which was
so dangerous, from its very magnitude, that to
another it might have proved ruinous and
fatal. The community, in fact, was so much
more powerful than the individual, that when
its aggregate interests came in competition with
his, undoubtedly he would have been sacrificed,
through some law framed to meet the occasion.
Now, his avidity would not allow him to risk
the forfeiture of any part of the prospective
advantages to be derived from his secret, and
his foresight taught him the safest means of
enjoying it. He made one portion of society&mdash;its
powerful millocrats without their suspecting
it&mdash;his accomplice against the remainder, and
worked out his own designs by interesting their
cupidity.</p>

<p>John Cash was possessed of the true secret how
to stay the vegetable contagion. Sulphur, which
was then supposed to be a pure body, just as water
was formerly held to be a primitive element,

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

really contained a principle which was the
true antidote to the germinating poison.</p>

<p>Sulphur could furthermore be so prepared
that this principle acquired affinity for any
given substance, with which it then became
necessary to combine it to draw forth its disinfecting
virtues.</p>

<p>Though this material had been long used so
extensively in arts and manufactures before a
direct and simple mode had been discovered of
procuring an acid more powerful than that
which it forms by combination with oxygen, it
had no longer any commercial value at the
period to which allusion is made, excepting as
a specific for the cure of mange in dogs.</p>

<p>The only mine in which it still abounded,
was consequently almost abandoned, and the
first step of John Cash was to become its
purchaser.</p>

<p>He next compounded a recipe of many
ingredients, in which he included sulphur and
the peculiar material with which its anti-contagious

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

principle had been prepared to combine.
These were introduced, (after the fashion
of the beef added "to the stone soup," which the
hungry traveller taught his stingy hostess how
to make) into a prescription which recalled
the Rosicrucian nostrums, by which, alike in
the dark ages, the falconer restored health to
his hawk, or the leech administered an emetic
to his patient, and which might consist of such
ingredients as the following:</p>

<p>"The pinions of a bat's wing calcined&mdash;two
heads of dandelion, gathered on the second
night of the full moon&mdash;a raisin, touched by
the finger of a dead man, buried during a
thunder-storm, and dug up on the stroke of midnight&mdash;the
first egg of a bittern&mdash;the eye of a
newt and down from the breast of an owlet,
pounded together&mdash;three drops of blood from
the tip of the tail of a black cat, without a
single white hair, in a spoonful of the milk of
a sow, who had devoured her own farrow&mdash;the
roasted liver of a fox&mdash;a sprig of mistletoe&mdash;the

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

tail of a snake&mdash;the gall of a badger, <i>and
four grains of ipecacuanha</i>."</p>

<p>A recipe, compounded in this spirit,
together with a process of wholly imaginary
utility, he caused to be offered to
the ruling capitalists. They tried it&mdash;they
experimented on it&mdash;they grew keenly sensible
to the importance of a discovery which
made them masters of every man's bread, and
whilst bargaining with the negotiator, he died
suddenly, and they remained possessed of his
supposed secret. They patented and kept concealed
the process of this new discovery&mdash;they
combined their wealth, as usual&mdash;they laid up
stores of corn, and flattered themselves that
they had found a means of securing their dominion
alike over the labouring masses, and
the petty capitalists jealous of their power.</p>

<p>At first these hopes were realised, but, in
the course of time, the changes in the vegetable
disease rendered it periodically imperative
to add some fresh ingredient to their disinfecting

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

process to render its virtue efficacious.
One season it was naphtha; a second,
arsenic; a third, the juices of the poppy. Now,
it always happened, that notwithstanding all
the precautions taken by the millocrats to
buy up simultaneously the material required,
that, in some unaccountable manner, its newly
acquired value had got wind, and that they
had been forestalled by speculators, who, possessing
themselves of this ingredient, raised
their prices in proportion to those which, in
time-bargains, was set on corn and breadstuffs.</p>

<p>The truth was, that old Cash, whilst never
raising the price of sulphur, prepared it periodically
so as only to combine with some new
material, of which he had anticipated the
wholesale purchase, and which he sold at his
own price&mdash;not only mulcting the great speculators
of their gains, but luring them to their
ruin. Thus, whilst leaving the <i>millionaries</i>
to incur all the odium, Cash had been

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

gathering in the prodigious harvest they thought
to reap&mdash;weakening their authority, drawing
them into his power, and collecting
round him clients and a party. Though endeavouring,
by every means in his power, to
retire from public notice, rumours of his
amazing wealth got spread abroad; he was
pressed by the <i>millionaries</i> themselves to take
his seat amongst them, and at length both the
millocrats, the minor capitalists, and the people,
conceived so great an esteem for one who
possessed the merit of being <i>so very rich</i>, that
they, one and all, united to vote him a testimonial,
which it was deemed would be most appropriate
in money, and which was subscribed
to the amount of a hundred thousand
pounds. Such was the man who, though not
a tithe of his means, views, and ambition, were
divined, had still risen to such importance, that
he was known to hold the balance of parties.</p>

<p>As the ceremonious senator, and the

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

inaccessible premier came forward to receive
him, with a malicious affectation of respect, he
returned the salutations of the obsequious
lacqueys, who offered to take his hat and umbrella,
addressing them as Sir, and assuming
the awkwardness as he had donned the garb of
one of the people.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Upland Castle," said the
senator; "I missed the pleasure of receiving
you at the station."</p>

<p>"You came by the Branch Upland line?"
asked the minister.</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;by the last mixed train."</p>

<p>"How could I have missed you! I examined
every passenger!"</p>

<p>"The passengers alight on different platforms;
I came by the third class train."</p>

<p>"And you walked alone to the castle!"</p>

<p>"Not alone&mdash;I picked up three companions&mdash;two
ratcatchers, and a sow gelder&mdash;we came
together."</p>

<p>The grooms of the chambers bit their lips&mdash;the

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

lacqueys were on the broad grin, though the
seneschal frowned on them with all the severity
of that De Bracy, who was dying in his war-harness
beneath a tree upon the canvas on
which a few streaks of paint pictured the field
of Flodden in the distance.</p>

<p>Lord Lofty, who felt unspeakably annoyed,
hastened to conduct his guest into further privacy,
pitying and vexed at the uncouthness of
his new ally, which he little thought to be
ostentatiously paraded.</p>

<p>It was the pride of John Cash to make the
old <i>millocrats</i> blush at the man with whom they
were obliged to fraternise, or on whom they
were base enough to fawn.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE GALVANIST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the ruined chamber of a decayed tenement
an old man shivered over the burnt out
ashes which had grown cold and white
upon the hearth. The mouldy paper hung in
shreds from the wall, and the wind whistling
through the broken window panes disturbed
the fitful flame of an expiring lamp. There
was no furniture in this room, except two
wooden settles, a table and some shelves; but
though crowded with miscellaneous articles,
their dilapidated condition and the disorder in

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

which they were heaped together gave it an
aspect more cheerless than absolute vacuity.
Books, minerals, jars, crucibles, and various
portions of the apparatus used in chemistry
and galvanism were scattered about or piled
together, torn, broken, cracked, or mouldering
on the cobwebbed shelves, or in the dusty
corners. The room beyond, into which the rain
habitually poured through the inhospitable roof,
held nothing within its damp, bare walls but
two pallets in a corner, a few cooking utensils,
and writing implements upon a barrel reversed,
which served instead of table. Everything
in this habitation denoted poverty and
decay; and the aged man who sought impossible
warmth from the cold embers appeared
as complete a wreck as everything surrounding
him. His frame was bowed and broken; his
hair and beard of snowy whiteness; his cheek
hollow; and his eyes blear. His bony hands
appeared almost transparent as he stretched
them tremulously out with the palsied motion

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

of extreme senility, and his voice had dwindled
to a cracked and feeble treble.</p>

<p>The whole scene was more sombre even
than those dark pictures of Rembrandt which
frown in tints of bistre and of sepia, because
here imbecility with its lack lustre eye appeared
allied to old age.</p>

<p>Suddenly there approached light footsteps,
and a female figure stood before him&mdash;frail but
so fairy-like that it seemed typical of youthful
grace in contrast to his decrepitude.</p>

<p>"Oh! Tempest, Tempest!" muttered the
old man querulously, "even you abandon me&mdash;come,
Tempest, blow the fire; I am very
cold&mdash;what isn't it Tempest! Ah, it is you,
Dame Slowman. Bad times&mdash;bad times! How
is your rheumatism, neighbour Slowman?"</p>

<p>"Are you suffering?" inquired the young
girl advancing a step that he might discover
his error; but he looked her full in the
face and continued.</p>

<p>"Ah, Dame Slowman, it is kind of you&mdash;you

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

have brought me a little tea. I have got
a teapot there too," added the old man,
and feeling for one embedded in the ashes, he
fumbled at its broken lid; "but there is no
tea in it! no tea&mdash;no tea! and no money to buy
more; though, poor mad old soul, I might have
all the gold in the world if I choose it. I&mdash;I am the
man of the age, Dame Slowman; but I wish
you had brought me a little warm gruel. We
have fasted a good deal lately;&mdash;it is cold of
nights, and the fire <i>does not</i> burn brightly."</p>

<p>"Have you no food?" asked the young
girl.</p>

<p>"No food, and few teeth," said the old man,
rather soliloquising than in answer to her
question, and then he continued garrulously,
"He is a good lad though, Dame Slowman; but
he grows weak through scanty fare and watching.
He has eaten but little these three days,
and not much for weeks before; but do not
say that I told you so. The fact is he could
get little to do; and if we did not pay up the

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

rent they would commit me to the Union; for
we have no sufficient means of livelihood, and
I am sick and silly; and if I were to plead
that I have not long to live, they would pack
me off by the next pauper train; for who, they
say, is to bury me? And then Tempest sold
his cloak to purchase stuff to feed the galvanic
current, so that I am cold at nights, for he does
not cover my feet with it now. If you leave
me faint, and cold, and hungry, you shall never
have my secret, Tempest&mdash;you are too weak
and ungrateful. I will never teach you to
humble the great ones of the earth; but they
will rouse the wolf in your heart at last; and I
think you are almost ready to put the knife
to their throats now?"</p>

<p>And so the old man continued to mutter
on, whilst the blood of the young girl began
to curdle, for at that moment a gleam of the
expiring lamp fell steadily athwart a glass
vessel on the chimney piece, exposing its transparent
contents&mdash;a human hand suspended in

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

some liquid, and which seemed to tremble
in the flickering flame which glared on
its cadaverous whiteness. A few minutes
before, a feeling of profound pity had filled
her breast, at the sad spectacle of misery and
drivelling idiotcy before her, rendered the
more melancholy by the morbid illusion of
power and importance in which the aged
schemer and his young companion seemed to
indulge alike. But as it now struck her that
this mania might have merged into ferocious
insanity, a cold shiver came over her, and she
was about to retire, when the latch of the
outer door moved, and she mechanically took
refuge in the corner, remaining unnoticed,
alike by the old dotard and the new
comer.</p>

<p>The personage who entered was the same
who has been introduced to the reader in the
chapter which brought Julian Beauvoir and
Eustatius Cash to Upland Castle.</p>

<p>His aspect was so peculiar, that he could

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

not readily be forgotten, and seen even amid
thousands, it arrested the attention and impressed
the beholder at once with the conviction
that there was something strange about
his character or history.</p>

<p>It required to observe him minutely before
you could determine whether he were young
or middle aged.</p>

<p>The deep lines of thought, the sunken eyes,
and the full voice, might indicate forty, whilst
his figure, the elasticity of his tread, the profusion
of his hair, and other signs of juvenility,
scarcely denoted twenty summers.</p>

<p>His features were noble, his brow was
high and ample, his eye was full of intellect,
his frame proportioned for agility and vigour&mdash;but
his cheeks were hollow, his countenance
emaciated, his complexion sallow, and his
limbs fleshless.</p>

<p>Privation had evidently preyed upon his
man-like vigour, and there was a dreamy expression
about his eyes, sometimes awakening

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

into haggard restlessness, at others, flashing
into fitful brightness, which led you to doubt
whether that intellect, outwardly evidenced by
so many signs, was not neutralised by insanity.</p>

<p>Perhaps, rather, his expression was that of
the opium eater, when the reaction of the
fatal stimulant in which he indulges, leaves
mind and nerves unstrung, and in truth he
was addicted to a terrible kind of stimulant,
which was not only preying upon his youth, but
had worn down to the last faint spark, the
mind and vitality of his companion.</p>

<p>"Ah, Dame Slowman, there is nothing like
a bit of cheerful fire," said the old man, looking
wistfully into the face of the youth, who,
without answering him, seized his hand, and,
with the other, disengaged the magnetic fluid.</p>

<p>Flashes of flame, like that of the aurora
borealis, broke from his body, and shot living
from his eyes. During the expulsion of
this ethereal fluid by one more subtle still,
his features, glowing in their self-emitted

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

light, wore an expression of inconceivable
agony. But this was only momentary&mdash;for, in
an instant, the young man and the grey-beard
were enveloped alike by the magnetic current,
and filled with the intensity of life which it imparted.
Of this discovery, men dreamed in the
days of Lavoisier&mdash;of this discovery, half a century
back, the animal magnetists were the impostors
and the prophets&mdash;having been then
presentient of its undefined existence, just as
before the discovery of America, by Columbus,
land was conceived to be beyond the main,
though the billows of the Atlantic were supposed
to wash the shores of Cathay.</p>

<p>The effect of this magnetic current was
startling. The old dotard sprang to his feet,
the youth awakened as if from stupefaction,
and they stood forth like gods of the Greek
mythology&mdash;one the primeval Saturn, with
all the wisdom gathered through all time in
every furrow of his brow, and on his lips the
bitterness of him pre-doomed to be dethroned

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

by his own offspring; the other, Latona's son
when full of youth and thought, and daring,
he drew his radiant arrows to the head to pierce
the Python.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE MESMERIC STATE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young girl, spectatress of this transformation,
was equally affected by the strange
influence which had produced it.</p>

<p>She, too, felt that she stood within its
mysterious cycle, as a novel and undefinable
sensation stole over her, keeping her spellbound
to the spot, without power of speech or
motion, but at the same time endowing her
with an unaccountable insight into the very
minds of the old man and his companion.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

<p>Every feeling and every recollection, as
each arose, and became interwoven and
fashioned into thought, appeared distinct to
this new sense of mental and psychological clairvoyance
with which she suddenly found herself
gifted, as the external aspect and motions
of their bodies to her corporeal eye. Of
this faculty were possessed in a far higher
degree, the young man and the greybeard,
who stood in the very focus of the magnetic
disk, which, revealing its form and intensity
by a glow of light, had caught her figure only
in the pale refulgence of its outermost circumference.</p>

<p>They conversed without words as without
power of concealment or deception, but at the
same time&mdash;so absorbed in this inter-communion&mdash;that
they had no perception that their
hearts were laid bare, like an open book, to
the scrutiny of a witness. This singular interchange
of thought, which did not reveal itself
by translation into language, was nevertheless

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

distinctly intelligible to these three personages,
and might in substance have been rendered
into words as follows, though&mdash;comprising, as
it did, sweeping recollections of the past, and
yet being expressed without resort to the slow
process of interpretation&mdash;it exhibited simultaneously
and vividly, whole passages, which
the pen can only tediously impart.</p>

<p>"You are come back, Tempest," thought
the old man, "heart-sick, world-weary, and
almost disposed to contemn and hate with me;
but pride and obstinacy will not let you yield.
You have felt that you were an intellectual giant,
inheritor of my knowledge, who have journeyed
to the brink of discoveries the most
startling which genius and research have ever
revealed to man. Your heart has dilated in
self-consciousness of the magnitude of your
mission and the purity of your intent; and
thus you have come in contact with a race&mdash;pigmies
in heart, and soul, and mind. You
who know the long and terrible years of self-denial&mdash;of

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

agony and of exhaustion, by which
I have purchased knowledge&mdash;you who have
had&mdash;not faith to believe&mdash;but penetration to
discern my truth, and courage to follow in my
track&mdash;you whose expansive heart pants to
devote and utilise these gifts and acquisitions
to the happiness of your kind&mdash;you have seen
me pass through life scorned as the visionary&mdash;shut
in the maniac's cell, or regarded with
scornful pity as the driveller and the pauper.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I, who have exhausted a mind and body
more capacious in its grasp and its endurance
than the bodies and the minds of half a
score of men&mdash;I, who, when the worn out principle
of vitality and thought is declining, still
concentrate their energies, and to the last
live for a few hours an intellectual life at
the expense of idiotcy and moral torpor, the
remainder of the day!</p>

<p>"I, who have been despised, oppressed, and
trampled into obscurity&mdash;the Archimedes who
could not speak the barbaric soldier's tongue&mdash;the

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

Columbus, novice in the pedant's formula&mdash;the
Newton, ignorant of some common-place&mdash;I
have been therefore condemned to live in
penury, contempt, and fear; and to die unappreciated
and unknown upon the bourne of
mighty secrets; whilst others with stolen fragments
of my mind have moved society to its
foundations.</p>

<p>"I, whose long life is drawing to a close, and
you who have seen into its past and borne
witness to its present, how stands our reckoning
with humanity?</p>

<p>"It is but a few days since that, wan with
watching our experiment, and faint through
feeding it with the food that should have fed
your body, you were called away to waste
your eloquence on the steward of our landlord.
We owed him nothing&mdash;our rent was
paid&mdash;but he told you that his master, like the
other lords of the earth, had made a rule that
they would not shelter those who could not
prove direct and ample means of livelihood for

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

the living or of burial for the dead. You
gained&mdash;not from the master but from the
servant&mdash;a little respite, nothing further.</p>

<p>"It is but a few days since that you went to
seek employment of the castle librarian&mdash;did
not this man, pampered into drowsy plethora
by indulgence, covetous of your services, yet
envious of your acquirements&mdash;did he not, humble
you by the array of his diplomas against
the irregularity of your studies&mdash;did he not leave
you to be turned repeatedly away on account
of the sordidness of your attire, and then reproach
you with dissolute idleness in not
earning more speedily that bread which you
<i>had</i> earned, and for which you were famishing
in heart, in body, and in mind. In heart
because that delay was want to me; in body
because it was hunger to yourself; in mind,
because the fruit of long vigils and irrecoverable
time was being wasted from want of oil
to feed the lamp of experiment, thus trimmed
so assiduously and long in vain.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

<p>"All this was bitter, when you knew that
your wan cheek was pale with superhuman
effort&mdash;when you knew that day by day in your
privation you were rejecting certain opulence
and power to struggle for the problematic
glory of being a benefactor to your kind&mdash;when
you knew that the very cloak, whose
absence discovered the thread-bare poverty of
your garments, had been sold in your necessity,
and that out of its divided price, half having been
devoted to my malady, you had defrauded the
hunger of your body to assuage a mental
thirst; that, being without bread, you chose
rather to purchase what was requisite to solve
a chemical problem&mdash;and that, on your way to
make this purchase, an impulse of humanity
made you devote this little, an inestimable all
to you, to relieve the misery of a stranger.</p>

<p>"Yet these, you argued, are but menials,
whom servility has debased; to-day you came
in contact with their masters. Your art had
taught you that one thing only could prolong

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

my life. This fact, self-confident ignorance
not only called in question, but the great and
wealthy master, surrounded by all the luxuries
that affluence can give, denied your boon
deliberately.</p>

<p>"These are the rich, and the servants of the
rich. What are the poor?&mdash;are not their
words even now ringing in your ear, as they
jeered at your mud-bespattered garb? No!
believe me, and you are disposed to share in
my conviction at this hour&mdash;mankind, in the
mass, deserves its ignorance and its misery.
There may be, indeed, individual merits, and
to these exceptional enjoyments may be given,
but under pain of forfeiture, if extending
them to the undeserving herd in violation of
that eternal law which restricts them to the
exception."</p>

<p>"Never till now," replied the youth, "have
emotions so contending racked my bosom, for
at this moment I doubt not only of others,
but of myself. I have recognised the extent

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

of your intellectual power, none the less comprehensive
because in everything incomplete&mdash;none
the less great because resembling the
imperfect ingenuity of the mechanist, whose
constructions&mdash;wonderfully devised in every
part&mdash;are wanting in a single screw. I have
fathomed the magnitude and profundity of
that Promethean genius which might have contrived
the human frame, and have gathered
from the elements the principle of life to animate
it, forgetting after all an orifice to the
lungs.</p>

<p>"I have not judged with the vulgar, for
whom a gulf divides failure from success
even when trenching on it within a hair's
breadth&mdash;for whom these creations, wanting
completion, would be a mere mass of iron or
of matter confused and wasted. I, therefore,
have listened to you always with wonder,
always with profound curiosity, yet never with
thorough confidence or unlimited conviction.</p>

<p>"I knew that if in some things gifted beyond

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

other men, you were in some deficient below
the average of your kind.</p>

<p>"I knew that in your hate of man you were
not constant; I knew that in the vindictiveness
cherished through years, you wavered and
you doubted, whilst I obeyed the one unchanging
impulse&mdash;the voice which never faltering
or wearying, inspired me with the longing to
benefit humanity, and to redeem rather than
avenge the crime of those who had sinned
against it.</p>

<p>"You prepared me for the reception of your
mighty secret, in the belief that time would
change this feeling&mdash;you offer me the means
of power on condition that I employ it to
humble and confound, but not to save; you
are ready to put into my hands the torch, so
that I consent to use it not to enlighten but to
destroy; and, in the hope of that change in
my sentiments, you have withheld it till the
last faint flame is flickering in the lamp
of life. And I <i>am</i> changed yet not as you

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

could wish me; for if my opinion of mankind
is shaken I have lost all confidence in myself."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the old man, "first indulgent
ignorance; now, knowledge and disgust; next
hatred of your kind&mdash;the true progression.
You deified your own heart in your secret
thoughts, and created that of your whole race
in its image. Reality has tried it. You have
found it wanting.</p>

<p>"Hear me, Tempest! Long since persuaded
that the knowledge which penetrates the
arcana of the universe, compassing its
secrets, can never be the fruit of one single
life, or of one unaided intellect, I looked
amongst my fellows for a disciple who should
have length of years before him beyond mine,
and qualities of heart and brain which I was
not possessed of.</p>

<p>"It was you whom I selected out of thousands
whose dispositions I had read. I remember
well how, wearied with the search, I was
seeking shelter from a storm, when your

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

infantine daring attracted my attention. The
blackness of the clouds had turned the day to
night; and yet the earth was radiant with the
lightning. It struck the oak before us
charring and shivering its trunk. Your young
companions trembled and wept with terror;
but you stood boldly forth, looking upon the
electric flashes like a young eaglet peering
into the sun. When they shrieked 'It will
destroy us!' you replied 'I stand between it
and you;'&mdash;when they said 'Do not look at
it,' you answered 'I must see whence it
comes and whither it goes.'</p>

<p>" 'But it will blind you!'</p>

<p>" 'Not before I have seen.'</p>

<p>" 'It will kill you!'</p>

<p>" 'Not before I know.' It took not long
for me to discover that I had lighted on the
one amongst millions whom I sought. You
were a poor neglected child, without even a
name. I called you Tempest in memory of
that day. Since then we have traversed strange

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

lands together, and wandered over paths of
science no less strange and dreary. In you I
found a thirst of knowledge and organisation
of intellect fitting you to follow my
most subtle abstractions together with a daring
and endurance in which even I was wanting.</p>

<p>"Our life together was one of terrible adventure,
intensity, and pain. The taper removed
from common air into an atmosphere
of oxygen, which rapidly devours it, is not
submitted to an agency more rapidly consuming.
In mastering the laws which govern
the vital principle, have not our researches led
us to the bed of death with its delirious horrors&mdash;to
the charnel house with its disgusts&mdash;to the
experience of every kind of horror which can
rack the mind&mdash;of every agony that can wring
the body?</p>

<p>"In you indeed I always recognised a spirit
less comprehensive, though more complete,
and bold, and practical, than mine; in fact,
more human, and as such I had hoped that it

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

would prove the conducting link betwixt me
and those whom I would wither&mdash;those to
whom I came the prophet and high priest of
science; but who baffled me by vulgar fraud and
repulsed me with their base contumely. My nature
has indeed only a partial development; but
yours is that of man in the full completion of
all his attributes, with every sense of mind and
body&mdash;with every propensity and passion in all
the prominent proportions of the antique
Hercules. As there is amplitude of brain,
so was there vast capacity of heart alike to
love or hate; and it was natural that the love
of man should fill it enthusiastically, till mankind
became known to you as it is to me.
Then I believed, and still believe, that cynical
disdain will succeed to your philanthropy.
But death is overtaking me before you have
acquired that fatal knowledge; for if your
precocious youth has become initiated into
things unrevealed to the most learned, in
others you are ignorant as a child. Step

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

by step I have led you by the hand along
the paths of every human science; but time
has failed me, and torn me from your side
midway.</p>

<p>"Thus we have plunged together, age by age,
deep into the lore of history, gathering from
its contradictory falsehoods truth; but&mdash;though
the past is familiar to you&mdash;though none is
more profoundly versed in the records of bygone
generations down to the last half century&mdash;you
know nothing of the present; it is a
chapter I had once hoped we should peruse
together, but which you have never opened.</p>

<p>"The last and most important study to which
I thought to urge you, was that of man, read
in the book of actual intercourse, and when
you had ran through some of its bitter pages,
I would have trusted you with power&mdash;content
that I should be avenged. But it is not
so, and I must die, either allowing my spirit
to be extinguished like a meteor, which, traversing
the air innocuously, goes out with

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

unimparted flame, strewing with its detritus
the earth it might have scorched&mdash;or else
I must trust it into hands, from which some
worldly, cunning, will entice it, and to one
whose heart will betray himself and me!</p>

<p>"Yet why should I despair?&mdash;your profound
faith in yourself is shaken, and you are not
one to remain midway. You know that my
hours are numbered&mdash;science might for a brief
space have prolonged them, had selfish arrogance
allowed. You know that we have reached
that bourne, which, overstepped, will leave,
dividing us, the difference betwixt life and
death, and you are startled at yourself to find
so many mixed and contradictory sensations
qualifying your regret on the verge of that
eternal separation. Inextricably blending in
your bosom, there is mingled a longing for the
power I can bequeath&mdash;doubt of your own convictions&mdash;reproach
of me, as the author of that
doubt&mdash;and self-reproach at such a feeling

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

towards me. You are not indeed prepared to
play the avenger yet, but you are shaken in
your devotion to mankind, and the thought
has flashed across you that irrespective of good
or evil to others; there lies a middle path of
self-gratification between the devotion of
power to my cynicism or your expansiveness.</p>

<p>"You have discerned that there may be
charms&mdash;in humbling the proud&mdash;in frustrating
the wary, and in the common-place
pre-eminence of success&mdash;and with these
there mingles and obtrudes the vision
of a fair girl, with eyes of liquid violet,
and lips whose expression speaks without
sound or motion. There is about her an ideal
beauty, a magnanimity, and restlessness of
aspiration, which added to the interest of her
fate, has strangely troubled you, and made you
feel, if only for a moment, that with such a mate
it would be sweet to wander through the
world's common-place ways, abandoning alike

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

the path which your enthusiasm had shaped
out so perseveringly, and that to which I inexorably
point the way. You reject the
thought. She is the daughter of the very
man who in the full pomp and circumstance
of success and wealth, deliberately denied the
trifling boon you asked&mdash;the medicine to my
malady.&mdash;Do you not long when you think
on that to play the desolator!</p>

<p>"This is one of the earth's great ones&mdash;he
was bartering his own child when he gave
you that refusal. Your own ears heard it.
And to whom? Oh, mercy! to <i>his</i> son
the son of my arch foe and persecutor! What
has it come to this, that even the mightiest
struggle irremediably in his toils, and has this
man become so far the idol of his fellows that
his successes follow me into this corner of the
earth to disturb my dying hour?</p>

<p>"Mark! Tempest, mark the difference betwixt
him and me! Mine was diffusive benevolence

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

and the light of genius; he had but
sordid thoughts and vulgar cunning. Through
me he rose yet me his foot kept down&mdash;and
now how stand we with the world? To my
penury are denied the crumbs that fall from
the rich man's table, who for him has no
refusal&mdash;decking even with a bridal wreath
the blushing temples of his virgin child, to
drag her to his feet a voluntary offering!</p>

<p>"It was that man, Tempest, opened first my
eyes to human baseness&mdash;He filled my heart
with gall; he cowed and broke my spirit. To
find refuge from him I have cowered into obscurity;
but now there is a haven more
secure&mdash;the grave, which opening for me, gives
me the daring, which has always failed me,
to hurl defiance at him.</p>

<p>"Even now, Tempest, I would humble him
to the base man he has humbled, if there were
only time."</p>

<p>"Wretched creature!" thought Tempest,
referring to the senator, "of that time which

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

might be salvation to him, his cold-hearted
denial has deprived you. This agitation wastes
life terribly."</p>

<p>"Aye," continued the old man, "life is
wasting&mdash;let us once more lay bare the vital
action."</p>

<p>"Consider," said Tempest, "that every
time we augment the intensity of life and
of perception, it is at the expense of the little
that remains to you."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I will it. "</p>

<p>"Then I obey you." And the youth gradually
increased the power of the magnetic
spell.</p>

<p>This exalted stage of clairvoyance was
frightful even to the maiden who stood partially
within its influence, for not only was
thought conveyed with indescribable rapidity
from brain to brain, but all the most hidden
properties of matter, with all the psychological
phenomena which enter into the being of that
wondrous creature&mdash;man, became to the mesmerised

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

distinctly and intelligibly perceptible,
The innermost secrets of the human frame,
with the mysteries of its organisation and vital
principle, were rendered visible to the eye
as the workings of the coloured fluid, which
through transparent tubes of glass ingeniously
simulates the circulation of the blood, to
illustrate its action in the human body.</p>

<p>"It draws to a close," said the old man,
reading his companion's thoughts, "without
exceeding the span allotted to common&mdash;place
mortality; for if, on the one hand, I have
discerned and baffled those maladies to which
the ignorant fall a prey, on the other, the mind
had preyed upon the body&mdash;If on one hand,
science has enabled us to distinguish the evil
and pointed out the cure, our poverty and
man's avarice, or incredulity, forbids the
medicine.</p>

<p>"Nature in its organic products presents in
a thousand forms the remedy for every malady;
and to these the appetites which we denaturalised

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

so often, afford a general index. That art which
soars above this perverted sense of animal
perception, teaches us that there are moments
when a drop of dew, or a grain of wheat, or a
draught of the sea's brine, may change, divert,
or influence in the germ the causes of decay.
Thus months and months have we baffled dissolution;
but now the remedy which might still
for weeks have protracted the progress of
decay, is beyond our reach. The want of one
single berry of the grape is fatal&mdash;and my
hours are numbered."</p>

<p>The youth with a sigh relaxed the exhausting
intensity of the magnetic current till it
had reached a point at which the maiden lost
her perceptive power, but at the same time was
freed from the restraint of speech and motion
which she had suffered. She stepped forth up
to the Galvanists, who now became for
the first time cognisant of her presence. It
was the Lady Calliro&euml; holding in her hand the

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

fruit the old man coveted, which she had come
to offer.</p>

<p>When she had dismissed her women and
parted with her favourites and her flowers, she
had resolved to take a last look and adieu of
scenes that she should no more revisit with the
feeling of her girlhood.</p>

<p>She had wandered through the long galleries,
the orangery, the artificial gardens. Here hung
obtrusively one bunch of grapes amongst its
decayed and mouldering fellows large and
tempting as the enchanted fruit of the subterranean
gardens into which the magician
ushered Aladdin. It recalled the haughty
supplicant, his strange request and the unfeeling
answer of her father. A sudden impulse
urged her in this last hour of her freedom to
minister even to the morbid longing of a dying
man. She reached the burnside cottage, raised
the latch, and, entering, had been witness to
the scene described.</p>

<p>The grey-beard clutched at her offering

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

with all the eagerness with which old age
clings to life.</p>

<p>A ray of more kindly feeling chequered for
a moment his misanthropy; but the reaction
of the exhausting influence to which he had
been subject, and the suddenness of this reprieve
overpowered him for the moment. Meanwhile
the shades of night had darkened, and
the sound of the castle bell was heard tolling
as if in hurried anxiety across the park; for
the Lady Calliro&euml; had been missed, and it was
hoped that this signal might recall her. Tempest,
with brief thanks for her benevolent
intervention, offered to lead her across the
park. The night was cold; the Lady Calliro&euml;
not in attire to brave the external atmosphere.&mdash;The
youth looked for his cloak to throw
around her, and then as he recalled that he
had parted with it, and stammered an excuse,
a blush rose to his brow, and another to her
cheek; for she remembered that with its price
he, hungering, had ministered to the necessities

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

of a stranger; whilst she contrasted her
father's conduct with this generous devotion.
They walked on both in agitation and in
silence. The Lady Calliro&euml; appearing to Tempest
an ideal being beautiful as good, whose
apparition had restored him to confidence in
human nature; and her thoughts filled
with wonder at the occurrences of the day,
which had called into being sensations and
given her an insight into things she had not
dreamed of a few hours before, and in this
reverie she made strange comparisons between
Julian, her future husband, and the youth
beside her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the galvanist was left alone; his
thoughts gradually cleared from their torpor.
There was before him a reprieve of life, and
his mind returned to one of the oscillations of
doubt to which it had ever fitfully been
subject.</p>

<p>"After all," he mused, "why should I
dread to shrink into obscurity&mdash;what matter

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

if my individuality merge into eternity unnoticed
as a rain-drop in the mass of waters?
Have I not merited that which has happened
to me&mdash;if I had never followed the dictates of
revengeful feeling would despair and doubt be
upon me now? Should I, like the imprisoned
Afrit, who vowed through centuries to recompense
his deliverer, and then to destroy whoever
should free his captive spirit&mdash;should I
have alternated between the wish to curse or
bless my kind? perhaps in man evil is not
unredeemed. Age, both in man and in society,
may render them corrupt and harsh; but is
there not in youth an ever freshening fount?
Age has denied me even a few brief hours,
but youth has wiped out its delinquencies."</p>

<p>Thus musing, the old man raised to his lips
the grapes. Never was mouthful more alluring,
since Eve tasted of the fatal apple which,
in exchange for happiness and ignorance, was
to bring death and knowledge into the world,&mdash;never
since the freshening draught the angel

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

of the desert brought to Agar's child.</p>

<p>He raised the fruit with the bloom on its
deep purple, and lo! like the apples of the
dead sea's shore, on his lips it turned to ashes.
A dust, black and loathsome as that which
fills the grains of blighted corn, fell from the fair
husk; and at this sight the old man fell back
and sickened to his very soul. <span class="smcap">He knew and
recognised his slave and master</span>.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">THE SECRET OF THE GALVANIST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> while Sir Jasper believed that he had
secured for ever his own ascendancy through
the projected alliance between the daughter of
his follower and the son of old Cash, and
whilst the <i>Moderate</i> leader was equally assured
that he could command the all-powerful co-operation
of so important a confederate, this
personage himself regarded the intrigues of
both these politicians with the contemptuous

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

confidence of one who felt that he held in his
own hands the trump cards of the game, besides
possessing the self-proven art of playing
it with inexhaustible patience and unequalled
skill.</p>

<p>But though the fate of the "United Monarchies"
thus appeared to rest between the
combinations of these two popular statesmen
and the modern Plutus, we have seen that an
old man&mdash;an outcast in his dotage&mdash;arrogated
to himself the power of far superior arbitration,
and threatened, as he shivered over his
cheerless hearth, by an occult agency, so to
convulse society as to reduce them all to insignificance.</p>

<p>So while in the dark ages the gloomy foresight
of tyranny was erecting blood-cemented
strongholds intended to perpetuate through
centuries their dominion&mdash;a monk in his lonely
cell was compounding from three vulgar substances
a grain, like a mustard seed, which by

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

its explosive power was destined eventually
to change the whole art of war, destroying
for ever the security of these once impregnable
fortalices, and rendering ineligible for all
martial purposes the very sites on which they
had been reared.</p>

<p>So whilst the ambition of churchmen&mdash;pressing
into its service the learning and experience
of the past, and the sagacity and prescience
of genius&mdash;was labouring to complete and
fructify a system of traditionary and intellectual
coercion which would have insured the
perpetuity of priestly domination&mdash;a humble
artisan was contriving those little pieces of
metal which in the form of types were progressively
to banish ignorance from the world,
and to annihilate all monopoly of knowledge.</p>

<p>In a like manner the old galvanist in the
depth of his obscurity had called into existence
a new power, which endowed his decrepitude
with a tremendous faculty of which he was at
once the author and the victim.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

<p>This self-created influence had snatched
from him the last brief hours of life to which
old age clings so tenaciously, and though in
the person of Tempest he left after him
one gifted with courage, enterprise, and intellect
sufficient to fructify the opportunities he
had wasted, this inheritor of his discoveries,
though qualified for successful antagonism with
the colossal abuses of society, had, in the very
power to which allusion has been made, a terrible
and perhaps fatal adversary.</p>

<p>Who and what was this mysterious agency
the creature and destroyer of the galvanist,
and future rival of his successor's triumph?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This rival was an insect</span>.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">THE HISTORY OF THE INSECT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wide world teems with life&mdash;life assuming
in endless succession inexhaustible varieties of
form.</p>

<p>If we refer to the past, the geologic traces
of those gradual or convulsive changes which
by means of water or of fire our earth has undergone,
are known to be filled with organic
remains indicative of the existence of whole
vegetable and animal systems which have

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

flourished, decayed, and passed away to give
place to novel combinations of vitality with
matter.</p>

<p>If we confine ourselves to one of these
series&mdash;that contemporaneous with ourselves,
we find that each extension of our visual or
perceptive powers discovers life where it had
never been suspected.</p>

<p>Philosophers of antiquity had conjectured
our globe itself to be but an enormous animal,
and pantheism, which forms the unacknowledged
foundation of so many creeds, resolves itself
into a supposition that the whole universe
constitutes one mighty existence of which our
world is a component, but infinitesimal atom.</p>

<p>Natural philosophers, of modern date, have
suspected that in some form of hopelessly imperceptible
minuteness, life was every where
occasioning the various properties of matter.</p>

<p>Rocks and islands growing into continents.
have risen from the deep, and seas are being
filled up by a worm. The sands on which

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

the Prussian Capital stands are discovered to
be living.</p>

<p>The plague and cholera are suspected of
organic life, which is distinctly visible in a
disease more loathsome, though less dangerous.</p>

<p>Life, indeed, when scattered, appears to be
reproduced in some fresh combination, as in the
myriad of crawling things which swarm from
a carcass, or the grass which springs from a
grave&mdash;and its dispersion resembles that of the
rust, or oxide, which, driven off in the furnace
from a bar of iron, rises in the form of a gas
and readily settles on other pieces of the same
bright metal rusting or oxidising them.</p>

<p>The principle of life was once held to be
the same with soul, and the power of thought
in man, or of instinct in animals, and it was
held blasphemous to suppose that science could
ever resolve its mysteries.</p>

<p>Intolerance and incredulity at that day forgot
that a time had been when&mdash;alike to the

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

meditations of the sage and the perception of
the most vulgar understanding&mdash;water had appeared
incontrovertibly a pure and simple element,
and light and heat identical.</p>

<p>They forgot that those who first argued
that the sun was stationary were charged with
impiety, or that Rome and Oxford branded
the early Geologists with infidelity. They
forgot&mdash;when stigmatising as blasphemous the
mere conjecture that man, who had called
down lightning from the clouds, should ever
learn to animate matter&mdash;that unless we deny
him all free will, Providence had, in its natural
order, endowed him with a certain limited control
over animal and vegetable life. It is the
volition of the farmer which fills his fields with
living kine, his yard with poultry; it is the will
and foresight of the silkworm breeder which
collects myriads of insects which but for him
would never have had existence, and it was
once at the option of both to determine that
they should or should not have been.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century,
when the pretended knowledge of the day consisted,
as regards galvanism, in the discovery of
a few electric phenomena, and was limited to
the recognition of certain effects of which the
causes remained utterly mysterious&mdash;at that
period already we read that chance had enabled
experimentalists to give accidental life
to certain animalcul&aelig;.</p>

<p>The fact was disputed at the time, and the
discovery denied with all the vituperative zeal
of envy disguised as godliness and presumptuous
ignorance in the mask of learned humility.</p>

<p>These experiments were, indeed, afterwards
successfully repeated at long intervals, but the
results originating in chance and not in combination,
were so clamorously denied and malignantly
decried, that they remained apocryphal
in the popular estimation.</p>

<p>There was, however, one individual who,
having witnessed this accidental creation of

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

animal life&mdash;encouraged by its proven practicability&mdash;devoted
days and nights to the study of
its mysterious principles.</p>

<p>When the first glimmering of truth, bewildering
because incomplete, broke in upon him,
in the exultation of his heart he published his
discoveries, to the world, but the world, strong
in the opinion of its wise ones, laughed to
scorn his pretensions, ridiculing them as a
delusion worthy of the credulity which could
accept as true the fact on which his anticipations
were founded.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, through discouragement and
contempt he still pursued his way, till at length
his efforts were rewarded. He obtained a
result which, though imperfect, differed as
much as light and darkness from that which
his predecessors had attained. His was an
<i>invention or combination</i>, theirs had been a mere
<i>discovery</i>.</p>

<p>Minute, misshapen, and organically incomplete&mdash;a
creature grew beneath his hand and

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

palpitated for an instant in transient vitality.
It was but for an instant, and no eye but his
own was witness to his hard earned triumph,
but he derived irrepressible hope and energy
from that proud moment in which, with the
profound conviction of Galileo addressing his
inquisitors through his prison bars, he too could
utter "<i>Still it moves</i>."</p>

<p>Years more of labour passed away, but at
length his object was accomplished, and he
had called into existence a creature not only
endowed with momentary life, but gifted with
an organisation sufficiently perfect, to enable it
both to live and propagate its species.</p>

<p>As every product of the animal and vegetable
kingdoms may be classified, this insect
belonged to the genus of Acari.</p>

<p>A half century ago the Acarus was known
to comprise more than sixty varieties&mdash;the tick
in sheep, the mite in cheese, the wonderfully
minute animalcul&aelig; discovered in wax, and those
occasioning a skin disease once nationalised beyond

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

the Tweed&mdash;belong to the tribe of
Acari.</p>

<p>The new variety created by the galvanist
was a thousand fold smaller than the mite.
In the long process of its formation myriads
of shapes had grown beneath his plastic hand,
hideous and strange as those first living works
of nature which in the early stages of her
labour peopled the earth's surface&mdash;weltering
in its tepid slime&mdash;the <i>pleiosauri</i>, <i>ichyosauri</i>,
and those shapeless and cold blooded things
which were replaced by creations more perfect
in serial succession down to man.</p>

<p>But nature in the most crude of her attempts
had ever been complete, even when
imperfect. She brought forth no abortions
like those of the galvanist's creation in his long
enduring trials&mdash;no fragmentary bodies half
limbed and wanting the organs of digestion,
respiration, and secretion, or incapable of renovation
and increase. Yet these were all
errors which had to be amended as he proceeded

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

with his task, and the last, but most important
of the obstacles surmounted had been
the difficulty of conferring on his creature the
faculty of assimilation with any natural substance,
(thereby to recruit the exhaustion of
body which life inevitably occasions) and secondly
of propagation.</p>

<p>So deeply had the galvanist been engrossed
with these last problems, that in solving them
he shot beyond his mark, endowing the new
Acarus with this power to an extent which
made the insect, though invisible even to the
microscope, a fearful monstrosity.</p>

<p>The venomous animalcule, supposed to occasion
the Djuma, or black plague, owes its
chief terrors to its contagious and infectious
character, which is nothing but the faculty of
fearfully rapid increase, under given circumstances
happily rare&mdash;the favouring conjunction
of miasma in the air, or of predispositions.
in human bodies.</p>

<p>But this new Acarus created by the galvanist

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

was possessed of a power of multiplication
which a thousandfold exceeded in rapidity
that even of the insect of the plague, and furthermore
it did not depend on the casual combination
of putrescent exhalations from the
earth, or of morbid emanations from animal
bodies for a congenial element in which to
exist, but was fitted to live, find nourishment,
and develop its horrible prolificness in any
medium through which its creator chose that
it should propagate its being.</p>

<p>Having mastered the great secret by which
nature adapts the organs of its creatures to
the pre-existent substances on which it intends
that they should feed, he too could modify the
animalcule he had made, so that according to
his pleasure it could find sustenance in a seed,
or fluid, or animal matter, increasing to an extent
so fearful as entirely to change their properties
and nature.</p>

<p>The galvanist&mdash;still in his youth&mdash;had
paused after his long labours. Though

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

immatured and partial he had made varied
and great discoveries, but the very necessities
of science now recalled his thoughts
from the world of speculation and experiment
in which they had been absorbed to the realities
of common life.</p>

<p>Great means were requisite to prosecute his
investigation, he was steeped in penury
and decried as a visionary.</p>

<p>But thus aroused from his long abstraction,
he recalled the gentle cause of that ambition
which had urged him in his strange pursuits,
whilst at the same time he became acquainted
with a fact which filled his breast with hope.</p>

<p>Though in earlier years, his wild and
incoherent genius had occasioned disgraceful
failure&mdash;succeeding to the most flattering promise
in his studies&mdash;and though contemptuous
indignation had replaced the sanguine expectations
of his relatives, there was still one fair
kinswoman whose looks were always tender

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

and whose faith in him had still remained unshaken.</p>

<p>He had, besides, a friend tried and true,
who through every failure had rendered
homage to his merit, regarding all his words as
oracular, and retaining the fervency of his belief
in the galvanist's eventual success.</p>

<p>This friend, indeed, had been the medium
of communication betwixt him and his sweet
cousin Anna when denied her father's door.</p>

<p>For some months he had indeed lost sight
of both, when driven back upon the world by
his necessities, he learned that the death of a
relation had bestowed a vast fortune upon his
friend.</p>

<p>Chance seemed thus to have crowned
his wishes. His friend possessed that wealth
which now was the only requisite of success, and
success would unite him to his cousin. Under
these circumstances he proceeded without delay
to seek him out.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

<p>He found his friend, but altered in temper
as well as circumstances.</p>

<p>He had succeeded to his uncle, a great contractor
in the last war waged between the
United Monarchies and the Democratic Union,
and the enthusiastic and confiding youth had
become the abrupt-mannered and supercilious
man of business.</p>

<p>He expressed pithily and distinctly that the
ideas and feelings of his earlier years had undergone
considerable modification, he confessed
his present disinclination to every thing speculative
beyond the sphere of his present occupations,
and pleading the pressure of his numerous
engagements, bowed the galvanist out
before the latter could recover the power of
utterance, or bring himself to make one appeal
to the memory of the past.</p>

<p>"My best wishes will always attend you,"
said the contractor with his hand upon the
door, "but I have now a credit and a business
character at stake, and cannot consequently

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

with any prudence allow my name to be associated
with that of visionary schemes and not
very practical projectors. I regret, therefore,
that I cannot with sincerity express any desire
to renew our former intimacy, even though
you have become a connexion."</p>

<p>"A connexion!" echoed the galvanist.</p>

<p>"A very <i>remote</i> connexion," replied the
contractor, "since I have married your cousin
Anna."</p>

<p>On this startling intelligence of the treachery
of his friend and the inconstancy of his inamorata,
the galvanist felt stunned and overwhelmed,
and staggered to the gate without
remark or exclamation.</p>

<p>But at night he wandered back to the spot.
Lights glittered from the casements, and the
sounds of festivity broke upon his ear. He
cursed alike the woman, who had deceived, and
the friend, who had betrayed him: but as he
walked away, asking himself whether that curse
should remain for ever barren, he passed the

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

vast rows of warehouses beside the harbour in
which even at that hour vessels were unloading
to fill up these magazines with stores of
corn, the contractor's property.</p>

<p>One sack, as the porters were removing it,
had burst. The galvanist gathered up a handful
of the corn, he took it home, he adapted to
it the vital organisation of the insect he had
created, and thus innoculated with this living
venom, he restored the grain to another heap.</p>

<p>Months after, the contractor, in the place
of his hoarded store, found only husks and
ashes, but from this poisonous germ the contagion
eventually spread through every land,
and thus the galvanist let loose upon the world
his creation from the glass vial in which he
had so long imprisoned it.</p>

<p>It was only after a lengthened interval that
he became conscious of the full effect of that
intended retribution.</p>

<p>Then like a child who having produced a
mighty conflagration by the ignition of a straw,

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

surveys with amazement and alarm the progress
of the devouring element and the extension
of the fire in which whole edifices crumble&mdash;so
he found that disease, alarm, and famine
were threatening or consuming tens of thousands.</p>

<p>His first thought was to frame a remedy for
the evil he had occasioned, and he who had
contrived that fatal combination knew enough
of nature's secrets to contrive the antidote.</p>

<p>His second was to apply it unreservedly.</p>

<p>But meanwhile he discovered that the contractor
himself, though he had suffered temporary
embarrassment, had in the long run
derived an accession of prosperity from the
general calamity.</p>

<p>The baffled malignity of the galvanist now
knew no bounds, and as he brooded over his
projects of revenge, it struck him that he held
in his own hands the means of power and
fortune which would help in its achievement.</p>

<p>But in the first steps he took to utilise the

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

important knowledge of which he was possessed,
he failed through utter ignorance of the world.
The excitement of his manner, and the magnitude
of his pretensions causing him to be universally
scouted as an impostor, or neglected as
a madman.</p>

<p>No one would listen to him, or entertain his
project, till at last, embittered against all mankind,
he retired to his garret a confirmed misanthropist,
seeking consolation in the thought
that at least all humanity would suffer for
baulking him, through its incredulity, of his
revenge.</p>

<p>His landlord, a dealer in marine stores, a
hard featured and hard fisted man, who had
turned a deaf ear to what he thought his
lodger's ravings, grew, however, suddenly
respectful.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the realisation of certain
minute prognostications made by the galvanist
had furnished his host with that proof of his
guest's superior knowledge which the latter had

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

neglected to adduce when seeking to obtain
credit in his wildly improbable assertions.</p>

<p>The galvanist, whose phrenological acquirements
had given him an insight into the
salient points of individual character, from
want of which he had suffered so bitterly in
his choice of mistress and of friend, was struck
with the qualifications which, in his estimation,
peculiarly fitted this personage for participation
in his secret, and co-operation in his
plans.</p>

<p>The characteristics of John Cash, the rag
and bottle merchant, were an insatiable thirst
of gain, combined with unscrupulous energy,
deep foresight, and profound astuteness in its
pursuit. These qualities never degenerated into
impatient avarice or desultory cunning, but
had assumed the form of the most comprehensive
avidity, boundless in its desires, but blent
with a practical ingenuity which taught him
without endangering the future how best to
secure the present.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

<p>This man by degrees extracted from the
galvanist his secret, on the double condition
that he should, in the first place, compass the
ruin of the contractor, and in the second,
divide his gains with the originator of them.</p>

<p>John Cash fulfilled the first of these stipulations,
but as to the second he found the temper
of his partner dangerous to his plans, and soon
learned to regard the pretentions set forth by
him as so incompatible with his own views,
that the day on which the contractor died a
bankrupt, the galvanist himself was carried
off to a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>Every thing connected with this arbitrary
incarceration had been legally and plausibly
contrived, and the incoherence of the victim,
together with the apparent wildness of his assertions,
lent readily to the deception practised.</p>

<p>Here in solitude the galvanist spent several
years.</p>

<p>During the first period of his captivity he
had proposed, amidst all his animosity to

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

his persecutor, to signalise his liberation by
the devotion of his discoveries to the benefit of
mankind, like the genius in the Arabian Nights
Tales, with whom he had compared himself,
who punished for rebellion, by imprisonment
in a sealed vessel cast into the deep, had, during
the first ages of his captivity, vowed
eternal gratitude to whoever should deliver
him.</p>

<p>But time passed on, and this feeling changed
to one of profound aversion towards his fellow-men,
a frame of mind on which he effected his
escape, and which ever after influenced his
actions.</p>

<p>The coercion he had undergone, had inspired
him, however, with so much dread of the
author of his sufferings, that he could neither
recover his self-possession nor muster even the
slender courage he formerly possessed.</p>

<p>The hare cowering in its concealment, and
startled at every falling leaf, lives not a life of
more unceasing apprehension. At length self-conscious

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

that this deficiency would doom his
malevolence to perpetual sterility, he resolved
to find out an accomplice, with vigour, youth,
intelligence, and daring, which he might fashion
into an instrument of retribution. With this
view he had chosen and brought up his young
companion.</p>

<p>His task was not yet done, his aim yet unachieved,
when, worn out with the exhausting
nature of his studies, old age, and decay, too
rapidly gained upon him. His latter years,
embittered by premonition of eventual failure,
if sometimes chequered by the suspicion that
his misfortunes had not been undeserved, and
by resolves more charitable, had yet been
characterised by deepening misanthropy. So
fretful became his temper that his malignity
was roused as readily as that of the weird
women of legendary tales. The jeers of children&mdash;the
mere contrast between his own privation
and the superfluity of others&mdash;or the
contumelious treatment to which his insignificance

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

and penury were exposed in an age
which respected only wealth and station, were
sufficient to draw forth his curse, and sometimes
that curse proved far more portentous
than even the malediction of the witch of old
was once believed to be.</p>

<p>Some weeks before he had wandered&mdash;sunning
himself in the welcome beams of an
autumnal noon&mdash;across the park, up to the
Castle gardens.</p>

<p>The old man looked wistfully through the
glass into the grapery, where the fruit hung in
luxuriant bunches, here green and ripening,
there darkening into purple or lightening into
amber. At this moment a surly voice warned
him away with a vehement execration&mdash;"What
business had he in the park? why was he
loitering there?"</p>

<p>The old man tottered home, but as his fear
subsided, his malignity was raised. He did
not rest till he had escaped from his companion,
and picked his trembling way back to

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

the spot from which he had been driven so
harshly.</p>

<p>Here, his palsied hands sought out the root
of the vine amongst its protecting straw; he
scraped an incision with his nail, and innoculated
the tree with living venom. The poison
spread&mdash;and if the vine had been a plant
annually propagated from seed, like corn, the
same contagion which had threatened the staff
of life would, far and wide, have destroyed the
vintage.</p>

<p>This act had been committed during his
hours of imbecility&mdash;planned with the cunning,
carried out with the tenacity, and forgotten
with the readiness of a weakened or disordered
intellect.</p>

<p>There remained of his angry feeling and
malignant purpose no trace in his recollection
but a longing for the fruit which had tempted
him to his revenge.</p>

<p>Whether this desire had grown into an
idiosyncracy so powerful as to affect his physical

<!-- vol 1 page 241 -->

frame or whether instinctively indicative
of its requirements, Tempest soon after discovered
that use of the grape could alone preserve
his expiring vitality a little longer.</p>

<p>This was the reason why he had humbled
his proud spirit to beg it of the Senator, and
why the glowing fruit, brought by that magnate's
daughter had turned to ashes as the old
galvanist raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>Self-baffled&mdash;the venom he had instilled had
poisoned&mdash;the insect to which he had given
life had devoured its core.</p>

<p>He recognised its presence&mdash;he knew the
mark of his own suicidal hand, and in that
hour of anguish obtruded vividly the desolating
thought that he had been through life, even
to its closing scene, the author of his own
undoing.</p>

<p>The retrospection of the past showed nothing
but a waste of blasted hopes, keen miseries,
and opportunities misapplied.</p>

<p>He felt that frittered away in petty vindictiveness

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

his vast discoveries had died abortive
through narrowness of heart. He felt that
his own creation, the slave of his own thoughts
had in truth become his master&mdash;the arbiter
of his destiny, leading him only into the madhouse
cell&mdash;the fugitive's retreat, the pauper's
pallet, and the grave at last.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE LEGACY OF THE GALVANIST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> that remorse and doubt gave way before
he thought that departing life and consciousness
allowed no further meditation.</p>

<p>Approaching dissolution threatened to snatch
from him that hope of retribution on the
authors of his wrongs, over which he had
brooded for so many years, and which had sustained
him through so many trials. A day, an
hour, a minute might plunge him in the impotence

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

of death. All awe of the grave into
which he was descending vanished before the
idea that it would bury in a common oblivion
his name and sufferings, discoveries and projects,
and his habitual misanthropy arose, like
a giant refreshed, in all its gloom, in the dark
recesses of his heart, at the thought of dying
forgotten and unavenged.</p>

<p>This hatred, though embracing all humanity,
distinguished two objects, one his old persecutor&mdash;the
other society at large, which baffling
his revenge had become, in his estimation, the
tacit accomplice of his arch enemy.</p>

<p>Now it was still in the power of the galvanist
to arrest or to extend the contagion which
he had spread; but in one case he felt that he
would favour the individual, in the other, the
race he hated.</p>

<p>He could not brook the thought that his old
foe should profit by the extension of his curse
upon mankind, and he grew frenzied at the
idea that society which had spurned and scorned

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

and trampled him whilst living should after
his death derive impunity from his persecutors'
punishment.</p>

<p>Reflection showed him that if he destroyed
the contagion mankind would be benefitted and
the source of his enemy's prosperity drained
dry, but how should he thus affect the immense
wealth which old Cash had already accumulated?
On the other hand if he punished his
fellowmen, by leaving the disease to prey upon
their food, his enemy would remain possessed
of an irresistible source of power; and thus it
seemed that in any case the sole effect of his
attempts at retribution would prove beneficial
to one or other of those on whom he thirsted
for revenge.</p>

<p>In this dark hour he concentrated by a
desperate effort of volition all the last energies
of his mind, and conjured to his aid the most
terrible secrets of his art.</p>

<p>Thus enlightened he devised a plan which

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

reconciled the contradictory exigences of his
double hatred.</p>

<p>"If," thought the galvanist, "I cannot
deprive this man of power I may crush him by
increasing it a hundred-fold, and I may bequeath
a curse to man which shall prove a
seed of such deadly animosity between the
individual and the race, that like scorpions girt
by fire, the narrowing circle shall inevitably
bring them into fatal contact."</p>

<p>With palsied hands the old man seized the
vessel which contained the insect germ in the
last stage of incomplete formation preparatory
to infusion of the principle of life. He had
often intended to adapt its organisation so that
it should prove an antidote to the contagion he
had spread, by fitting this new creation to prey
upon the old in imitation of nature which
renders one species of living creature destructive
of another to limit the increase of animal
life.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

<p>But now on the contrary he was about to
disseminate through completion of the embryo
a venom more widely diffusive than before;
because he meditated its adaption not only to
corn&mdash;which admitted counteraction of the
poison in the seed, or substitution of roots as
a staple article of food&mdash;but, successively to
every article which could be converted into
food for man, by means of a serial transmutation
of form common to insect life, and such
as we witness in the change which makes the
caterpillar, moth or butterfly. Before breathing
animation into the inert matter, he paused, however,
and there rose before him the vision of future
generations suffering for his crime. Gaunt
multitudes, pale with famine and ghastly with
disease, seemed to flit past, upbraiding him with
hungry looks. The mother drew and held up
the dead babe from her withered, milkless
breasts. The young snatched ravenously from
the aged the last bone against which their
carious teeth were crumbling. Hollow cheeked

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

men tottered past with knees giving way beneath
their slender weight&mdash;the child shrieked
feebly for its parent, and the parent's voice was
too faint to answer to the child's appeal. Ague
with chattering teeth&mdash;consumption's hectic
flush&mdash;the plague's black spots and cholera's
lived blue were all discernible amongst that
crowd which flowed past the old man&mdash;a living
stream of pestilence and famine, to sink into
the earth whose surface skeleton-covered
imaged a mighty Golgotha.</p>

<p>He shuddered; but the vision changed. He
lay motionless in his shroud, and the
heedless feet of a laughing multitude trampled
the sod above him as if he had never been,
cheering his persecutor who passed smiling by
upon his grave.</p>

<p>The vision changed again. From out the
earth re-appeared the ghastly crew and
gathered round his enemy with hideous gibbering

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

and famished looks, and cannibal
ferocity.</p>

<p>They seize him by his garments, they twine
their bony fingers into his grey locks&mdash;they
clasp their skeleton hands about his throat and
drag him back into the graves they had
quitted.</p>

<p>At this sight the galvanist gave a shout of
exultation, his mind was made up and he proceeded
with what might be termed alike his
process or his spell.</p>

<p>The new variety of the insect started into life.
Immeasurably smaller than the minutest atom
discernible even through the microscope which
magnifies the hair on a fly's leg to the thickness
of a human body, it was only visible to
magnetic eyes; and fearful was the sight as
joyously sentient of existence, it rolled its
hideous form in grotesque gambols, continually
emitting&mdash;like the dark clouds of sepia with
which the angry cuttle-fish tints the water&mdash;in
one unceasing stream myriads upon myriads of its

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

larv&aelig;, each in the space of a single second
reaching a stage of maturity which enabled it
in turn to develop an equally horrible prolificness.
The thought struck the galvanist that he
could still keep this plague imprisoned in the
vessel in which he had given it life, but quelling
this better impulse, he opened the cottage
door and, kneeling beside the brook that ran
before his dwelling, plunged the insect into its
waters, thus letting loose a fresh plague on
the world.</p>

<p>Henceforth he knew that whithersoever
that poisoned current made its way it would
bear contagion with it&mdash;whether by tainting
the broad river, or raised up as a mist into the
clouds and descending on the earth in the form
of rain or dew, or whether filtering through
its strata to reappear in the bubbling spring
and irrigate its surface.</p>

<p>The minutest globules into which the fluid
could be divided by heat or pressure, or filtration

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

still constituted each a sphere in which
these fearful animalcul&aelig; could live and thrive,
eventually penetrating wherever the liquid
atoms combined with any substance, and
poisoning as they penetrated all organic bodies
requiring moisture as a component element
of their being.</p>

<p>The old man shook back his hoary locks
which streamed in the night wind, and his dim
eyes sparkled feverishly as he thus uttered
his last denunciation.</p>

<p>"When the success of the statesman is forgotten&mdash;when
the feuds of party are buried&mdash;when
the strife of nations is hushed in the
general desolation&mdash;this deed of the nameless
and unremembered dead will fill the world
with terror. This is my legacy to mankind!"</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>The galvanist then staggered back to his
chair by the cheerless hearth and into his former

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

torpor, and this man, who in satanic majesty of
power for evil had just been scattering abroad a
curse perhaps destined to react on generations
yet unborn, stretched out his shivering hands
again over the cold ashes, exclaiming in querulous
and piping treble:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dame Slowman! is that you Dame Slowman?
You borrowed my last pinch of snuff&mdash;where
is the pinch of snuff you borrowed,
neighbour Slowman?"</p>

<p>"Poor mad old soul go to your bed, that
was six months agone," said Dame Slowman,
who this time really was beside him; and
then the old man, resting his elbows on his
knees, buried his face in his bony hands and
spoke no more.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Dame Slowman, putting down
in some embarrassment, as Tempest entered,
the empty teapot whose broken spout she
had raised to her withered lips.</p>

<p>"Only think, Master Tempest, he is dead
and cold,&mdash;deary, deary me! gone without priest

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

or bell. He was not a very bad man, so I will
get my thimble and go fetch Dame Gabble to
lay out the body and sew up those sheets into
a shroud for old acquaintance sake."</p>

<p>Tempest seized the old man's hand, but
found that his limbs were already rigid. He
stood in the dreary world alone&mdash;disinherited
of the dead man's secret.</p>

agreed it was decided that the Lady Calliro&euml;

so effective with the senator's daughter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the father of the bridegroom
was solicited to glance over the marriage contract,
which for brevity and conciseness would
have astonished our prolix ancestors, though it
was, notwithstanding, a complete and valid
instrument, having been drawn up by the
ex-lord Chancellor, Besom, there present,
(having accompanied Sir Jasper) for this
paradoxical personage, though avowedly a
<i>Moderate</i> and consequently a political opponent,
was almost exclusively on terms of intimacy
with the leading members of the Rationalist
party, into half of whose secrets he was
initiated.</p>

<p>Though this document contained nothing but
concessions and suggestions previously made

<!-- vol 1 page 256 -->

by the father of the bridegroom, both the
Prime Minister and the Senator watched his
perusal of it with profound anxiety; and when
at length he paused and hem'd ominously prefatory
to an observation, the eyes of the ex-chancellor,
who delighted in mischief, twinkled,
and the joint of his nose curled nervously, as
much as to say "I thought so;"&mdash;for this legal
dignitary possessed the singular faculty of
working his olfactory organ up and down at
pleasure.</p>

<p>In fact its stipulations were so advantageous
to the Senator that it became difficult to believe
that a man as shrewd as old Cash should
finally have agreed to an arrangement which
offered so little reciprocity.</p>

<p>By the first article of this contract, on the
one hand, the Senator (duly styled by all his
titles) agreed to the marriage of the Lady
Calliro&euml; with Eustatius, only son of John
Cash, settling upon his daughter (with reservation
 of a personal life interest therein) the

<!-- vol 1 page 257 -->

whole of his possessions, of which the enumeration
occupied more space than even the recapitulation
of his dignities and honours.</p>

<p>By the second article John Cash, who persisted
in being described as a "general dealer,"
consented to the union of his son Eustatius
with the Lady Calliro&euml;, only daughter of the
Senator; undertaking at the same time to
satisfy and liquidate all debts, mortgages, and
charges on the said property; and here followed
the gross amount of these liabilities,
which rendered it at once apparent that the
father of the bridegroom was in reality conferring
this vast wealth upon his son's wife,
besides giving her father a life interest in the
very property of which he no longer held any
but nominal and temporary possession.</p>

<p>Could it be credited that old Cash would
finally agree to this bargain? Nevertheless
when he spoke it was to read through aloud
the third article, which stipulated "That
the Senator transferred to his future son-in-law,

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

Eustatius, all other property of which he was
possessed, together with all rights and claims
to which he might be, or ever had been, entitled."</p>

<p>The ex-chancellor smiled sarcastically and
felt it on the tip of his tongue to explain that
"The Senator having, in consideration of their
full value, given up <i>all</i> his possessions which
his creditors were about seizing, liberally
endows his son-in-law with the <i>remainder</i>."</p>

<p>But at this moment the Senator was called
aside by the seneschal, and grew deadly pale
at the communication made to him. He was
about to quit the room when the ex-chancellor,
who not being bigotted to any social
proprieties, had followed at his elbow, turned
to the remainder of the party and acquainted
them aloud with the cause of their host's
agitation.</p>

<p>"She is off, gentlemen!&mdash;the bird is flown!"</p>

<p>"No!" said the Premier, whose utter dismay
could only be equalled by that of Lord Lofty;

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

whilst old Cash quietly shrugged up his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! my child is indeed missing,"
said the father of the fugitive; "but it is
impossible that she can have fled; she is eccentric
in her habits; she has wandered abroad
and lost her way: we will cause instant search
to be made."</p>

<p>"Search or pursuit, if need be," observed
the profoundly vexed Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>"Stay for one moment," said old Cash.
"Whether the Lady Calliro&euml;, your daughter,
have only temporarily absconded or finally fled,
my mind is made up. This alliance was
political in its objects, we cannot let them
be defeated by the whims of either boy or
girl. I am willing, happen what may, to
abide by all the conditions of that contract;
let us therefore add to it the stipulation&mdash;that
in the event of any impediment arising to
the marriage, whether from the disinclination
of any party concerned, or from any other

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

cause that all our promises be equally binding."</p>

<p>"This is an instance of more than Roman
magnanimity," said the minister. "And so you
will remain bound by the enduring ties of
friendship, if not by the frail bonds of relationship."</p>

<p>"I am grateful for the proposition; but I
must seek my child," said the Senator.</p>

<p>"Could you insert such an addition briefly
and validly?" asked old Cash of the ex-chancellor.</p>

<p>The great legal authority nodded and smiled
assent.</p>

<p>"Then suppose it be done and signed before
we leave this room."</p>

<p>"I must seek my daughter!" exclaimed the
father of the bride hastening anxiously to the
door, but he was arrested by the minister who
whispered him.</p>

<p>"Be ruled by me, all may be well&mdash;all will
be well&mdash;I doubt not; but do not throw away

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

this chance; if your daughter has fled, pursuit
is uncertain; if found, it may prove unavailing,
for she may be already married."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said the father.</p>

<p>"I know more than you do," replied
Sir Jasper, "of the Lady Calliro&euml;'s secrets.
Let us, whilst the matter is yet doubtful, at
once secure the offer made, which certainty
may cause him to retract. You are ruined&mdash;she
is ruined&mdash;I am undone if we miss this opportunity."</p>

<p>"But my child! evil may have befallen her,"
said the senator aloud.</p>

<p>"If so," replied old Cash, "ten minutes will
make no difference&mdash;you had better take me
whilst I am in the mood."</p>

<p>"The insertion is made," said Lord Besom.</p>

<p>"And strictly valid?" asked the premier.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more simple to execute,"
replied the ex-chancellor who took a boyish
delight in baiting the trap in which the rich
man chose to snare himself.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

<p>"There is even the <i>consideration</i> which the
law formerly required. Our friend here pays
the mortgages on all the property which our
host settles on his own daughter and in compensation
he cedes to that friend's son the
<i>remainder</i>, besides all other rights he may
possess."</p>

<p>"It will be intrinsically valuable," said Sir
Jasper, as a documentary curiosity if only
for the conciseness of that clause, and as a
valuable autograph. Does this meet with your
approbation, Mr. Cash?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the millionary, "let us
sign it."</p>

<p>Lord Lofty in the midst of his deep agitation
held out his hand to thank his guest
for what he called "this noble proof of confidence."</p>

<p>"We can shake hands afterwards," replied
Cash; "let us get this over&mdash;you write fluently,
but not plainly; now look at me, I
have not cramped my hand by over writing, I

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

cannot write anything but my name, but
every time that I scratch it down, some
little value usually changes hands. There it
is&mdash;J, o, h, n, C, a, s, h! Doesn't it look like
money!" exclaimed the old man surveying his
work complacently and wiping off a blot with
his thumb.</p>

<p>"Let us now each append our names as
witnesses," said the premier with an expression
of satisfaction which he could not quite repress
upon his countenance at the final success of his
difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>The anxious senator repaid the glance of
his chief by a look of confidence and admiration,
and the ex-chancellor slightly arched his
bushy eyebrows in wonderment, and then raised
the joint of his nose sarcastically.</p>

<p>"This is a great political fact," said the
premier <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"Faugh," replied the legal dignitary, "I
was prepared for Circean wiles; I came to
witness the capture of something like a Dragon

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

or a Hippogriffe by means of bird-limed twigs,
and lo! I have seen nothing but the immolation
of a golden calf. The most absurd part of the
exhibition is to mark the gravity with which he
examines and appropriates his own copy of the
contract which secures that valuable remainder
to his son."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the minister. "He affects to
consider it an equivalent&mdash;the intuitive delicacy
of a noble mind."</p>

<p>"I will not gloss over any man," replied
Lord Besom. "I say, the stolidity which,
having let drop the oyster, treasures the empty
shell. There are men born to greatness, there
are men who achieve greatness, there are
others who having greatness thrust upon them
are smothered and extinguished beneath its
weight like a baby under the fur cap of a grenadier.
Our friend Cash is one of these. I
congratulate you on his accession to your ranks,
you will find him perhaps docile&mdash;certainly a
fool. I have taken his measure. I know

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

width, depth, length and altitude, and I tell
you that this much-vaunted individual will
sink into that third-rate political insignificance
which the crassness of his ignorance and the
extent of his stupidity deserve."</p>

<p>The ex-chancellor during his tenure of
office had originated the law which rendered
his decisions final. Off the wool-sack his <i>dictum</i>
was always without appeal, on which account
the premier made no answer.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 266 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">A POLITICAL LESSON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the disappearance of the Lady Calliro&euml;
was investigated, the conflicting testimony of
the domestics led to the most serious apprehensions,
no tidings could be obtained of the
absentee. She had not passed any of the
gates&mdash;and her palfrey had returned to its stall.

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

It was therefore evident that she must have
crossed the park on foot. The great bell of
the castle was tolled and messengers despatched
in every direction to search the grounds and
scour the adjacent roads.</p>

<p>"Be calm," said the minister to the senator,
"we are now insured against all eventualities."</p>

<p>"Good God!" replied the distressed father.
"What is all this to me now? You hear,
she has taken a long farewell of all her
women. We have pressed the matter too
rashly on her. The thought of what may be
distracts me! She is gone&mdash;God grant that
it be not for ever."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! be discreet and calm," replied
Sir Jasper. "This must not reach the
bridegroom's ears. From the insight this morning's
interview gave me into your daughter's
character I augur more favourably of the matter.
Look here? the casement is open, her birds
have flown away, she has but wandered out

<!-- vol 1 page 268 -->

into the park in search of them and missed
her way."</p>

<p>"Clad in her indoor garments in the frosty
air!" said the father with a shudder. "She
may be lost upon the downs and perishing.
Sudden faintness may have seized her, or perhaps
in the darkness she has fallen over the
cliff," and so saying the senator, deaf to all
expostulation, rushed out into the park himself
to seek his child.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper left alone descended and paced
up and down the castle terrace. Here and
there lanterns gleamed and torches flashed
amidst the shrubberies and beneath the trees;
disappearing gradually in the distance.</p>

<p>"This is agreeable on the eve of a great
battle with an impatient party waiting for
one," said the minister as he watched the
moon rising from a cloud.</p>

<p>Its bright pale orb shone out at length in
sudden brightness silvering with its beams the

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

fern and grass and foliage in deep contrast to
the sombre shadows of the gigantic oaks;
and by this light Sir Jasper discerned two
figures which stepping out of the gloom into
the moonshine became at once distinct and
prominent.</p>

<p>The one was a female figure arrayed in
white, which he recognised without difficulty
as that of the Lady Calliro&euml;. This was sufficient
for the minister, who descended the steps
of the terrace and hastened towards her.</p>

<p>The senator's daughter and Tempest had
almost simultaneously paused within stone's
throw of the castle. Having seen her in
safety he appeared unwilling to approach
those inhospitable walls, and she, whilst mechanically
expressing her thanks for his escort,
did not press him further.</p>

<p>"We part, I trust, to meet again," said the
Lady Calliro&euml;. "I am a powerless girl to-day,
but I may be launched in the great world
to-morrow, and all that it lies in my power to

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

do for yourself or your companion you may
command, only forgive or judge not too unkindly
of one whose heart the perplexities of
his position may have hardened."</p>

<p>"I bear no ill will to individuals, but if
principles and classes were not beyond the range
of individual feeling your intercession, lady,
would persuade," replied Tempest with profound
emotion, for such words from the lips of
such a speaker were new to one whose recollections
of social intercourse were so barren of
kindness and of sympathy, for though acquainted
with the marriage about to be forced upon
her, he was not aware that unlike others she
had derived a profound but natural interest
from the insight which had been so singularly
afforded her into his character and story.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he added, timorously, "even
in my humble insignificance I might reciprocate your offer.
The rat gnawed through the
lion's toils, and gratitude might find a spell to

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

avert misfortune, if so young, so gentle, and
so fair you were about to be made unhappy?"</p>

<p>"We are the slaves of circumstance," replied
the Lady Calliro&euml;, hurriedly, for at that
moment her eye caught the figure of some one
watching them from the terrace, and she held
out her hand to Tempest repeating the hope
that they should meet again, but when this
personage advanced towards her she beckoned
him to stay.</p>

<p>She was not a little annoyed at perceiving
Sir Jasper approach her, and the minister
no less so at finding the daughter of his friend
at such a juncture and at such an hour accompanied
by a male companion, who, though
not Julian, was still a stranger to her father's
household.</p>

<p>"Thank God that you are found at last.
Where have you been, dear Lady Calliro&euml;?
Your sudden disappearance has given rise to
the most intense alarm."</p>

<p>"I do not know why," replied the Lady

<!-- vol 1 page 272 -->

Calliro&euml;. "Was it not with you that I stipulated
for a few hours to myself?"</p>

<p>"And this?" asked the minister in a tone
paternally interrogative, as he turned to her
companion who had made a motion to retire,
but upon whose arm she had placed her hand
detentively. The question was embarrassing.</p>

<p>Like one of those maidens with whom, in
Biblical times, the angels of light descended
on the earth to wander, and who knew through
their disguise that they were not of the sons
of men, at that moment her respect even for the
statesman was feeble beside the interest and
awe inspired by the preternatural acquirements
of the youth beside her.</p>

<p>But how hope to convey her impressions on
this subject, or explain the incongruity of her
present companionship to the minister?</p>

<p>In this embarrassment she replied resolutely,</p>

<p>"This, Sir Jasper, is Tempest," and then
addressing Tempest, added, "Since you have

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

accompanied me thus far across the park you
will see me to my own threshold!"</p>

<p>The minister felt somewhat puzzled at
the answer, "This is Tempest!" Who
and what was this youth Tempest privileged
to take moonlight rambles with an
heiress in her teens? Was he a foster brother
or a poor relation, and what would the intended
bridegroom think of such an intimacy? All
these questions were to be solved, but
as it was obvious that his friend's daughter
suffered from the chill of the night air,
he suggested that they should accelerate
their pace.</p>

<p>"We conjectured that your birds had flown
away, and that you had wandered imprudently
in search of them."</p>

<p>"No," replied the Lady Calliro&euml;, with a
sigh; "I let them fly. We learn the
value of freedom when about to lose
it, and I have let free all I held in
thrall."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

<p>"Freedom," said the minister, "is an ideal,
and, as commonly understood, an imaginary
abstraction. May not these fugitives long for
the sweet captivity from which you have released
them?"</p>

<p>"At this moment, the fluttering of a
wing was discerned upon the ground the
Lady Calliro&euml; stooped, it was her falcon,
Nero.</p>

<p>The talons of the dying bird were inextricably
fastened&mdash;in the neck of the dead Attila, his
fellow favourite of the perch and hood, whom
he had killed at a fell swoop, when loosed
by their imprudent mistress, and finding no
other quarry, one had pounced upon the other,
an accident&mdash;which as all acquainted with falconry
are aware&mdash;occasionally happens where
birds, of inferior power to the gerfalcon, are
used to hawk the heron, and consequently, flown
more than one together.</p>

<p>On endeavouring to disengage the stiffening
talons of her falcon&mdash;the faint vibration of the

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

pinions&mdash;the closing eye and succeeding immobility,
showed that all was over.</p>

<p>This was a few yards from the castle terrace;
on its first step there lay, with extended wings,
one of her bright tropical birds, and on the
marble pavement, another, and another, and
another, their bright plumage glittering in the
moonlight, but stiff and lifeless, as they had
fallen numbed by the cold, when perishing
in the wintry air, and beating their beauteous
breasts in vain against the casements of her
turret chamber, the prison house from which
she had expelled them.</p>

<p>"Are these more of your liberated favourites?" asked the minister.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the senator's daughter,
haughtily; and as if ashamed of the tear that
she could not suppress. "These were the
pastimes of my childish hours&mdash;but entering on
a new phase of existence, I wished to leave
no link&mdash;even trivial as this&mdash;between the past
and present. I freed them, thoughtlessly destroying

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

where I would have benefitted. The
act was inconsiderate, but is irrevocable. It
should be forgotten."</p>

<p>"No my child," replied Sir Jasper. "On
the contrary, it should be remembered, and treasured
as a lesson in the political career which
lies before you. Such, with mankind, is the
effect of loosening the social bonds at which
those whom they restrain cavil so bitterly, and
which youthful enthusiasm is apt to untie as
revolting and pernicious, whenever it has the
power, removing as you have done, at once a
trifling ill and the preventive of a fatal evil.
You wished to give your favourites freedom&mdash;they
have met with an untimely fate, and you
with disappointment. Denizens of a southern
clime, their life was artificial here, and you
gave them up to death when your restored
them to a state of nature. So with society, it
is an artificial state, and those reforms which
appear most natural and rational prove often
only sluice-gates to let in anarchy and ruin.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

<p>"But pray," interrupted Tempest, "recall
at the same time, that you restored them
not to the tepid atmosphere of the clime
where they were captured, but cast them
loose in the chill air&mdash;deadly and uncongenial
to their nature. There have been alternate
centuries, when violence or priestly
craft or philosophic sophistry or specious eloquence
have ruled the world. This age
deifies the rights of property, deducing even
individual liberty thence, and in this age,
lady, when you are told, that for the multitude,
impoverished, brutalised, and hardened
into crime&mdash;the freedom of a state of
nature, would resolve itself into starvation
and anarchy, then recollect that it is always supposing
that they be not at the same time&mdash;as
they ought&mdash;restored to that warmth and kindliness
of feeling natural to man, but which
selfishness and long oppression have destroyed
and chilled!"</p>

<p>Sir Jasper bent his brows on the presumptuous

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

theorist with an expression of
withering sarcasm, but in vain, for the youth
with an abrupt and ungainly salutation, took
his leave, and hastened back to the old galvanist's
cottage, where the reader is already
acquainted with the scene awaiting him.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">THE NUPTIALS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nine o'clock in the morning. The
small Gothic church which stood adjacent to
the castle within the precincts of Upland
Park, had been during the night fitted up with
all the magnificence which such brief notice
would allow. It was at that hour already
known that by ten o'clock of the same day
the marriage of the Senator's daughter would
be celebrated within its walls.</p>

<p>Vehicles were upset into ditches, wheels
driven off, and nags' knees broken in
the anxiety of the village gossips to spread

<!-- vol 1 page 280 -->

this astounding intelligence amongst their
neighbours, and yet be back in time to witness
the event they had announced.</p>

<p>Nothing, to all appearance, could be more
irrevocable than this sudden marriage. Julian
had quitted the castle the preceding evening.
If without even the simulation of mutual attachment
the bridegroom was obedient and
the bride resigned. Lord Lofty and old Cash
had signed a binding contract, and the Prime
Minister himself stood sponsor to this hasty
alliance.</p>

<p>The brows of the Lady Calliro&euml; were already
wreathed with white; the bell of the old
church was about to toll, and that stage of
the matrimonial proceedings seemed virtually
to have arrived when all who knowing any impediment
had neglected to make it known
were evermore bound to silence.</p>

<p>At this eleventh hour, when the whole party
were assembling in the state room of the
Castle, preparatory to the fulfilment of the
civil and most important part of the ceremony,

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

old Cash and Lord Lofty were called aside,
each by a missive so urgent as to command
immediate attention. Mutual excuses "for a
few minutes of inevitable absence" came to
their lips simultaneously, and a short time
only had elapsed when Sir Jasper was summoned
away; whilst the bride, who had just
made her appearance through the opened
doors, again retired.</p>

<p>The ex-chancellor, who was remarkable for
the inaptness and eccentricity of his proceedings,
had seized this opportunity to fasten a
fierce theological dispute upon the Bishop, a
mild and unargumentative prelate, whose temper
and acquirements led him alike to eschew
discussion, but who could not elude the fierce
onslaught of this unscrupulous and subtle adversary,
who was pleased hypothetically to
advocate the Buddhist theory in opposition to
the Christian dispensation.</p>

<p>Now in all this it struck the bridegroom
that so little account was taken of him that
he resolved to resent the neglect with which

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

all parties seemed to treat him. He too therefore
retired, and, after rambling through the
gallery, finally ensconced himself in a nook of
the library, where he was likely to remain
long undiscovered, being determined that his
absence should at length recall them to a
due sense of his importance in the approaching
ceremony.</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, just as Lord Besom
had entangled the Bishop in a maze of sophistries,
and badgered him into attributing the
opinions of Confucius to a father of the
church, and confusing the Vedantas with the
Zendavesta, the absentees reappeared, together
with the bride.</p>

<p>But every brow was thoughtful and clouded,
and it was obvious that even during that brief
absence some fact must have transpired, or
some occurrence taken place to modify the
feeling of all these personages respecting the
forthcoming event.</p>

<p>This change was evidenced by marked embarrassment
and unusual taciturnity, interrupted

<!-- vol 1 page 283 -->

by a few monosyllables which resembled the
rare drops of rain which before a storm fall from
a lurid sky through the oppressive atmosphere.</p>

<p>At this moment the prolonged absence of
Eustatius broke the spell and gave vent to
the approaching tempest.</p>

<p>"I am not young," said the Chancellor gallantly
to the bride, glancing at his person
the glass, as much as to say, "though devilish
well-favoured;" "but I should never look up
again if I had had the misfortune to have
kept the Lady Calliro&euml; waiting one second
upon such an occasion."</p>

<p>The observation if not mischievous was unfortunate,
for the blue veins swelled on the
temples of the Senator's daughter: her beautiful
lips moved scornfully, and she burst into
a flood of tears.</p>

<p>They were those tears, not of distress or
pain, but of passion and of pride, by which a
woman resents and avenges an indignity and
urges man alike to espouse her right or to
assert her wrong. Such Helen wept before

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

old Priam and his sons, and such Lucretia may
have shed to Brutus.</p>

<p>"My child!" said the father tenderly, approaching
her, and then turning to John Cash
he apostrophised him a little haughtily.</p>

<p>"I fear all this has been too sudden. The
behaviour of your son and my daughter's agitation
render it, I think, necessary that we
should postpone the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Or abandon it altogether and no harm
done," replied old Cash bluntly. "We are, so
to say, between four walls; you and I, the minister,
the lawyer, and the priest, and there is
therefore no reason why plain truths should
not be spoken in a plain way. This match was
made up like a bargain at a fair to suit your
book and mine; and the lass and lad were no
more consulted in the matter than the pig bought,
sold, or higgled for. But since she frets about
it I will not see her made unhappy. Look
here, my good girl," added the old man, taking
the Lady Calliro&euml; kindly by the hand, "dry
your blue eyes&mdash;a blessing on 'em.&mdash;This

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

match was made up because I was rich and
ready, and your father proud and poor; but
though I have settled on you what buys him out
and out, there is no call to take my son unless
you like him. I don't know that I should if I
were a woman, though, thank God, since
he belongs to me, he is not the ugliest
man in the united monarchies (here he
looked point blank at the ex-chancellor who
muttered 'And thank God I am not the greatest
fool.') Nor even if you are taking on after
any other spark. I can afford to do a handsome
thing if need be, and therefore wish to
make it plain that what I have promised is
promised whether you become my daughter-in-law
or not, which you never shall without
your free consent."</p>

<p>"The law," replied Lord Lofty, almost
contemptuously; "renders that contract already
binding, but I beg leave to waive it for myself
and daughter."</p>

<p>"At least," interfered Sir Jasper, "you will
limit to temporary use of his signature, the rights

<!-- vol 1 page 286 -->

acquired under it&mdash;an accommodation which
will no doubt be gratifying to our generous and
straight-forward friend."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear your daughter's answer,"
replied old Cash, drily; "come my girl, speak up
and tell the truth and shame the devil."</p>

<p>At this moment, the return of the bridegroom,
who had been hunted out in his nook in
the library, added not a little to the embarrassment
of the scene; but before the Lady Calliro&euml;'s
answer is recorded, it is necessary to the
development of the story, to give the reader
a peep behind the scenes, and explain the
causes which had led to so remarkable a
change in the conduct or opinions of all
these personages.</p>

<p>The written communication received by
the senator simultaneously with that which
called old Cash away, was hastily scribbled in
pencil&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>"I have travelled hither, by my husband's

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

permission, without a moment's delay, to
seek you out. I implore to see you, for a
few minutes&mdash;instantly&mdash;before this marriage
has taken place. I come to avert ruin and
disappointment.</p>

<p class="right">"In haste,</p>

<p class="right">"Your affectionate cousin,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Julia de Fougeres</span>.</p>

<p>"Blue chamber in the moorish library&mdash;twenty-eight
minutes to ten."</p>

<p>Julia de Fougeres was Julian's sister, and
well-known to the senator as a political intriguante
of the most incorrigible stamp, but
this long journey&mdash;the consent of her formal
husband&mdash;her knowledge of this mysterious
marriage, and the denunciations contained in
her letter, determined him, at least, to hear what
she had to say.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

<p>Madame de Fougeres had not her husband's
consent, she had only become acquainted
with the projected marriage beneath
the senator's roof, and she did not
come to save him from ruin, but only to prevent
his being over-reached in a bargain, and
to make her own; but as she had journeyed
direct from Paris, for that express purpose,
her note contained one literal and another
partial truth, a great deal more
than she usually infused into so brief an
epistle.</p>

<p>She startled the senator, however, by announcing
at whose instigation&mdash;for what
purpose&mdash;and armed with what secret she
had come.</p>

<p>Julia de Fougeres was actually despatched by
Middleman Cautious, the moderate leader, to
gain over Lord Lofty to his party! Wildly
chimerical as such an enterprise might seem
she declared herself mistress of a truth so
incredibly important, that it would at once

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

reverse the relative positions of John Cash,
and the senator as to fortune.</p>

<p>The spirit of intrigue, and a certain political
prescience which whispered to Madame de
Fougeres, that the long reign of the Rationalists
was drawing to a close, had led her
insidiously to cultivate an interest with the
Moderates.</p>

<p>When Middleman Cautious their chief was
introduced to the reader, he was chuckling
in the discovery of a secret which made him
master of the co-operation of old Cash, and
enabled him to appropriate all the influence
derived by that celebrated capitalist from
his enormous wealth. This discovery consisted
in having traced the source of his prosperity
to the possession of the sulphur mines whose
produce constituted the really effective ingredient
of the disinfecting medium of the contagion
affecting every kind of grain&mdash;and secondly,
to his having, through indefatigable

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

exertion, ascertained that the title to this
property was invalid, and that the right to
work the mines&mdash;having, together, with many
other obsolete rights, been duly purchased by
Lord Lofty's father, and never subsequently
sold by him&mdash;was according to the local law, which
allowed of no prescription, really vested in his
son. To this fact, held <i>in terrorem</i> over old
Cash, he had abjectly surrendered in all the
pride of his independent indifference. He
promised his influence and co-operation to the
Moderates, but instantly caused the possibility
of an alliance between his son and the daughter
of the senator to be suggested to Sir Jasper
who was led to pursue and conclude the negotiation
in the delusive belief that its successful
termination was due to his own persuasive
powers.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious had, however, caused
the movements of old Cash to be narrowly
watched, and though the utmost promptness

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

and secrecy had been used by the minister
and the millocrat, it was still ascertained by
him that old Cash and his son had started
for the residence of the senator, and coupling
this suspicious circumstance with the
unaccountable absence of Sir Jasper, the Moderate
leader, jumped to the conclusion that
his victim intended to elude his coercion
by some compromise with the senator&mdash;which,
ignorant as the latter still was of
his rights, he might effect on his own terms.</p>

<p>It was at the moment that this conviction
flashed across his mind, impossible for Middleman
Cautious to absent himself&mdash;to say
nothing of the difficulties of obtaining sufficiently
prompt access to the senator to prevent
the mischief.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, fully aware of
the risks he ran, he determined to employ
the unscrupulous, but bold and able Julia
de Fougeres, to attempt to detach Lord Lofty
from the Rationalist interest.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

<p>To trust her with his secret was indeed to
confide to one who might betray him, a weapon
of offence which by any further delay would
certainly be rendered useless in his hands.</p>

<p>On her arrival at Upland Castle, though
startled at discovery of the marriage then actually
proceeding&mdash;as she still derived confidence
and energy from the key which she possessed
to the motives of the "high contracting
parties," she resolved even at that stage to
interrupt it, and for this purpose had despatched
to the senator the hasty note just given
to the reader.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the negotiatrix was to persuade
her relative of the reality of her pretensions
without showing him her cards, and disarming
herself of her secret, as Middleman
Cautious had done by her.</p>

<p>The senator, if, for the best of reasons, he
had no objection to the change of party, had
unshakable confidence in his chief, and he was
growing pompous and incredulous when it

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

struck his cousin that as far as her personal
advantage was concerned matters might be
quite as satisfactorily solved by throwing overboard
the moderate leader and making terms
with Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was then summoned. His rapid
perception soon enabled him to fathom the
affair in all its bearings, he agreed to the terms
of the fair traitress and became master of the
astounding revelation which appeared almost
magically to place the senator in the envied
position of old Cash.</p>

<p>"It is not too late," were the first words
of Lord Lofty, "my daughter shall never wed
that churl's son."</p>

<p>"Hush," said the minister, "we must proceed
with caution. We may find some pretext
to delay or evade this marriage, but we dare
not break it off yet, for remember that this
man's adhesion to-morrow is of vital importance.
Leave it to me."</p>

<p>The habitual deference of the senator to his

<!-- vol 1 page 294 -->

chief led him to acquiesce though as we have
seen the elation of his sudden fortune
prompted him afterwards to interfere inopportunely.</p>

<p>The missive which had been at the same
time transmitted to John Cash had narrowly
escaped delivery, which was only secured by the
accidental presence of one of his son's attendants,
who declared that at all times the old
man insisted on all papers being put into his
own hands, a habit far less harassing than
would be supposed to a man who could not or
would not read.</p>

<p>He glanced at it hastily, and was about depositing
it in his capacious pockets when his
eye caught the seal, and he hurried from the
room to enquire how and when that letter had
been forwarded, and to give instructions instantly
to trace the messenger.</p>

<p>There was no need, he was loitering at the
gate, and was ushered into a private apartment&mdash;it
was Tempest.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 295 -->

<p>"This," said old Cash, with a mixture of
ferocity and trepidation, "is from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is from Him," answered Tempest,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Then you know where the maniac hides&mdash;you
know where he is?" said the old man,
eagerly.</p>
<p>
"His body is in the grave I have dug for it&mdash;the
vitality once animating it, floats free from
matter through the wide range of creation, and
his soul, disengaged from both, is with his
God."</p>

<p>"Dead!" ejaculated old Cash, whose knees
tottered, and whose unimpressionable features
seemed convulsed with agitation. "Dead!!
Where and how did he die? and who and what
are you?"</p>

<p>"His disciple and companion from the cell
in which you shut&mdash;to the grave in which
I have laid him."</p>

<p>"And did he leave nothing for me?" asked

<!-- vol 1 page 296 -->

the old man still in profound anxiety. "No
message&mdash;no curse&mdash;no blessing?"</p>

<p>"I know not which," replied Tempest,
"he wavered unhappily between his hatred of
mankind and you, and his sudden death has
left me the depository of his last will which I
had sworn to deliver into your hands if he
died without other testamentary disposition."</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked old Cash, with a stout
voice but a faint heart.</p>

<p>"I have a condition to make."</p>

<p>"A condition; we must become better acquainted.
All the world knows I am rich.
I can be liberal&mdash;you may find a friend in
me."</p>

<p>"Friendship requires reciprocity. I was
his friend&mdash;I am your enemy, but charged
with that which may prove a curse or
set at rest the anxieties of years. I know
not which."</p>

<p>"Do you want gold?" asked old Cash.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 297 -->

<p>"Not yours; I require a nobler price.
You have bought a bride for your son, the
bell is tolling now for the priest to consecrate
that sacrifice. Have you her free consent, for
on that condition only do I discharge my
trust?"</p>

<p>"What is she to you?"</p>

<p>"Like the first or last of womankind&mdash;a
sister."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to force her inclination."</p>

<p>"Then," said Tempest, "go now and put
the question to her, if you will promise so, and
keep your promise, within one hour I will
perform mine, if not I withhold his momentous
legacy."</p>

<p>"Do you not admit that it is mine?"</p>

<p>"Did you never keep back fame, wealth,
and liberty that was another's?"</p>

<p>"He had fearful secrets," mused the old
man.</p>

<p>"And they have died with him, unless they
be contained in that bequest."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 298 -->

<p>"If I consent, where is it?"</p>

<p>"Comply, and, for good or evil, it is yours
on your return; go, be prompt and remember
that you cannot deceive me."</p>

<p>Old Cash reflected for a few moments. The
unceasing cause of his anxiety was removed&mdash;the
suspended sword of Damocles had fallen
or was unhung, and certitude was about to replace
vague apprehension, but he was prepared
to find the confident of the man whom he
had persecuted, wild, eccentric and intractable
by ordinary means, and therefore made up his
mind to fulfil upon the spot the condition imposed,
which was not, as will be subsequently
explained, at that moment particularly
onerous.</p>

<p>With this determination he had returned
into the presence of the marriage party, where,
as it has been shown, his son's absence led to
the proposition to defer the ceremony, and afforded
him the opportunity of bluntly consulting
the inclinations of the bride, a point of

<!-- vol 1 page 299 -->

the story from which digression was made to
explain to the reader the change operated in
the feelings of Lord Lofty, Sir Jasper, and old
Cash by the episodes which have just been.
narrated.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on the senator's
daughter, and Lord Besom, who had thrown
himself upon an ottoman, resting his chin upon
his hand and his elbow upon his knee, surveyed
her with all the critical attention which
he usually devoted at the opera to certain passages
or steps in the d&eacute;but of a choral star or
nymph of the ballet.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml;, after a moment's pause,
cast her still humid eyes, with a glance of
unequivocal scorn upon the bridegroom, and
then turning to his father, she answered in a
voice whose tone at first respectful, grew at
length almost imperious.</p>

<p>"This marriage, planned without my knowledge,
was forced upon my inexperience and
timidity. Dragged from my maiden retirement

<!-- vol 1 page 300 -->

without breathing-time into the broad glare
of publicity, to serve political interests&mdash;I may
not now retrace my steps. To answer you
and my father and Sir Jasper, you will find in
me, sir, a dutiful daughter-in-law, mindful
both of the honour and the interests of my
adoptive family. This step has not only my
full concurrence, but&mdash;as at this time I have
the right&mdash;I <i>insist</i> that it shall take place."</p>

<p>"My child," said the senator, as soon as he
could recover his surprise, and notwithstanding
the signs made by the minister to whose admonitions
he was already far less docile&mdash;"my
child, it is at least well that you should know
that as regards your father, the causes which
rendered this alliance eligible have ceased to
exist. It was in fact only an error&mdash;I had
almost said a fraud&mdash;which prevented, but now
no longer hinders us from the possession of
that wealth which this contract was to have
secured."</p>

<p>Old Cash, without comment on this speech,

<!-- vol 1 page 301 -->

took out the contract from his pocket and
having remarked, "You remember that we
have made these stipulations binding whether
the marriage takes place or not," he read aloud
the third article, by which, in consideration
of the mortgages cleared by old Cash in
favour of the Lady Calliro&euml;, <i>her father ceded
to Eustatius all rights and claims whatever of
which he might be possessed</i>.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Sir Jasper, "that forgotten
clause is fatal."</p>

<p>"It cannot be binding!" gasped the senator
as he sank upon the seat, at this overwhelming
disappointment, whilst the ex-chancellor
exclaimed energetically,</p>

<p>"Safe as the law can make it, I pledge you
my professional reputation!" And then he
asked with eager curiosity, "But what has
occurred to give it point just now?"</p>

<p>"You knew of this!" said the senator
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Of course I knew it," replied the old man

<!-- vol 1 page 302 -->

quietly, and then he continued in the same
tone pointing to his son, "you will hence perceive
that according to this agreement that
lad would be just now the owner of the goose
that lays the golden eggs, but as I would not
trust the young Absalom, his right has been
duly conveyed over to me, and therefore,
as he is not worth a crown-piece, I command
him to fall down upon his marrow-bones to beg
pardon, for his unmannerly absence, of his wife
that is to be, for he would not readily find one
richer than I am bound to make her, nor I a
daughter who would please me better."</p>

<p>"My father," replied Eustatius, "you should
not interfere in lovers' quarrels; there is
nothing in the world I will not do to propitiate
the Lady Calliro&euml;; but this is no scene of
a melodrama."</p>

<p>"It will end like one, in a speedy marriage,
for if I had not a wife already I would have
the girl myself."</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; turned with winning

<!-- vol 1 page 303 -->

cordiality to old Cash, who kissed her on the
forehead, and then extending her hand in reconciliation
to her future bridegroom, with an
air of humiliating patronage, she allowed him
to carry it to his lips, rebuking his fatuity
by the unequivocal manner in which this action
expressed, that she forgave his discourtesy
for the sake of his father, and by the inference
to which her bearing led that she would as
soon have wedded the old man as his son.</p>

<p>Lord Lofty and the minister, who fully understood,
and were so deeply interested in this
scene, quite inexplicable to the ex-chancellor and
the Bishop, were still speechless with surprise,
for even Sir Jasper was awed by the successful
duplicity of this man, who had triumphantly
worked out his own designs by the very act
into which the statesman thought that he had
cajoled him.</p>

<p>As John Cash had everything now his own
way, it was agreed that the marriage should
proceed, and having been joined by Madame

<!-- vol 1 page 304 -->

de Fougeres, and the bridesmaids, twenty minutes
after, they were on their way to the
Gothic chapel.</p>

<p>"After all," said the minister&mdash;who had
hitherto been somewhat crest-fallen&mdash;to the senator,
"all is well that ends well."</p>

<p>"You will not forget," whispered the elated
Julia, "that you promised me the secretaryship
for my brother."</p>

<p>Sir Jasper smiled Jesuitically and blandly.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, but do you think he would accept
it?"</p>

<p>"In his position how can you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"Because he has just left this as governor-general."</p>

<p>"Impossible&mdash;a jest."</p>

<p>"The truth, upon my honour."</p>

<p>"Then my pains have been for nothing!"
exclaimed the lady, who, till reflection brought
her consolation in the fact <i>per se</i> of her brother's
prosperity, felt as much overwhelmed as
that traitress of Roman history, who having

<!-- vol 1 page 305 -->

sold the secret of her countrymen to the
enemy for his trinkets, was crushed beneath
their weight as the price of her treachery.</p>

<p>As the marriage party advanced up the
aisle of the chapel, a quiet smile of self-gratulation
played about the features of old Cash.
Scarcely yet recovered from their emotion and
surprise, the other actors in this scene, with
the exception of the Lady Calliro&euml;, looked like
people whom the solemnity of the occasion had
sobered into seriousness.</p>

<p><i>She</i> trod with a firm step and a brow serene
and haughty. Were her thoughts then of the
past or of its hopes, or did she indulge in
illusions of self-sacrifice? No; a newly-awakened
passion had grown to sudden maturity
in her heart and filled it with aspirations
of the future, and if her step is proud as she
moves along, and if her eye sparkles as she
glances round, it is with gratified ambition.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">REFORM IN 1906.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> which half a century before was a place
of cosmopolitan rendezvous, had in 1906 become
a cosmopolitan city.</p>

<p>Who that lounged along the broad pavements
of its scrupulously clean streets&mdash;thronged
with a crowd of passers by, jostling
each other in all the seriousness of business-like
abstraction and hurry, which can neither brook

<!-- vol 1 page 307 -->

detention nor waste words to make or to receive
apology&mdash;who that looked on its shop signs
recording, beside the name and occupation of
its tenant, almost invariably the address of its
branch establishment in Manchester or London
and sometimes in Calcutta and New York&mdash;who
that witnessed the tawdriness and filth
replaced by comfort and the elegance to which
smugness had succeeded&mdash;could believe that
he stood in the Paris which a generation past
was noted for the foulness of its narrow streets,
its dissolutely lounging throng and deep national
antipathies!</p>

<p>The streets of that most commercial and
methodical of cities Amsterdam, where never
brick was laid without Mercury's inspiration,
where no man ever walks abroad either hurriedly
or idle, and where even the black
Friesland horses, harnessed to their trucks,
pick their way soberly and busily on iron
pattens&mdash;the streets even of Amsterdam
thus filled, give only the idea of an exclusively

<!-- vol 1 page 308 -->

acquisitive city, but without any of that feverish
eagerness for gain and entire absorption in
its pursuit once only to be seen in Hull or
Manchester, or east of Temple Bar, but in
1906 distinctive of the Parisian population.</p>

<p>That its Anglophobia had as completely
vanished as its former horror of Jews, Saracens
and Sorcerers, and that intercommunication
had connected the former capitals of
rival kingdoms as intimately as neighbouring
cities of a common province, was abundantly
testified by the superscriptions which told
that the inmate of number thirty Rue Richelieu,
carried on business at 16 Regent Street, and
124 Cornhill; that the dress-maker of Rue de
la paix had a branch establishment in St.
James's Street, and that the wholesale offices
of the grocer of the Rue St. Honor&eacute; were in
Mincing Lane.</p>

<p>It was further evidenced by the prevalence
of the English language&mdash;which, like the
French in London, had become within a shade

<!-- vol 1 page 309 -->

as common as the aboriginal tongue, reminding
one of those towns which, like Brussels or
Strasburg, once formed the boundary where
two races mingled, and where French and
Flemish, and French and German were in a
like manner indiscriminately spoken.</p>

<p>This paradoxical change in the Parisian or
rather in the French character&mdash;for Paris epitomises
France&mdash;was a natural consequence of
its national conformation, which the progress of
civilisation had yet but slightly modified, even
long after its final triumph over the rivalry and
prejudice of barbarous nationalities.</p>

<p>There was always an imitative aptitude in
the French character, which periodically made
contagious some peculiar impulse, and rendered
the national tendency definite, complete and&mdash;in
contradistinction to Anglo-Saxon universality&mdash;exclusive.
Religious intolerance and
political oppression had always enemies in
England. She brought forth contemporaneously,
during centuries, the resolute dissenter,

<!-- vol 1 page 310 -->

the bold metaphysical speculator
the sturdy freemen, ardent soldier and
eager merchant. The French people in
the aggregate, assumed successively, each of
these characters. The whole nation in the
days of Voltaire and Rousseau, was an infidel
and cynical philosopher&mdash;in the ensuing revolution
a Republican theorist. Under the consulate
and the empire it was a soldier, and
with the expulsion of the elder Bourbon branch
it became a trader.</p>

<p>The substitution in the arms of France of
the domestic cock for the bold bird of rapine,
was already emblematic of this change, which
became less surprising in the subsequent
period which witnessed such an extension of
the influence of property in all surrounding
countries as to level before the fraternisation
of its possessors, the old barriers of nationality.</p>

<p>A half century back the idea would have
been scouted as preposterous&mdash;even with the

<!-- vol 1 page 311 -->

historic example of Scotland's buried feuds
and thorough assimilation&mdash;that France and
England could ever be united under one government;
but nevertheless in 1906, amongst
many stranger things which had come to pass,
London and Paris were joint capitals of the
United Monarchies, under which title, the two
countries&mdash;together with the greater part of
Europe&mdash;were federatively united.</p>

<p>The general parliament, congress, chambers,
or diet, for by all these names the great federative
assembly was called&mdash;met in due rotation
in December 1906 in Paris, a circumstance
which drew all the visitors of a London season
to Paris just as all Paris was poured into London
on similar occasions; for amongst other
changes in the character of the inhabitants of
the once gay city, the Parisian was no longer
satisfied that, with the exception of a forest and
the sea, Paris contained everything worth
seeing, or content in his most adventurous
mood to live and die in it, if he had passed a

<!-- vol 1 page 312 -->

day at Fontainebleau, or once peeped from
Dieppe pier at the broad ocean;&mdash;and then too
it must be borne in mind that in 1846 the passage
between the two cities actually occupied
four-and-twenty hours instead of four, besides
the chances of an evil against which no remedy
had in those rude days been provided&mdash;that
painful and prostrating sickness of the sea,
whose ridicule few Parisians of the Nineteenth
Century would willingly have encountered,
and which at that period was so formidable to
the nervous susceptibility of French vanity,
and to its keen sense of the ludicrous that a
daguerreotype of Guizot, or of Louis Phillippe
in that peculiar predicament would in three
months have sufficed to expulse the one from
political life, and the other from the throne for
ever. History teaches us that such an hypothesis
was of impossible realisation, because
recording that all political caricature was forbidden
by a law so stringent that it actually
degenerated into a mosaic or moslem in prohibition

<!-- vol 1 page 313 -->

of the reproduction of fruits by
pen or pencil; lest any fanciful likeness to
political characters might offend those in authority.
The writings of the day inform us
that after a celebrated trial, the mere design of
a pear was considered libellous and treasonable
on account of its supposed resemblance to the
physiognomy of the French King, We may
therefore judge whether animal painting was
tolerated by the law, and in this circumstance,
perhaps, discern the origin of the taste
at that day prevalent for the gorgeous arabesques
transmitted to us in lithographic collection,
and no doubt inspired by political
restriction as those of the Moorish Alhambra
were by Saracen intolerance, interpreting
literally the prohibition contained in the
commandment which forbids to make the
graven image of anything created.</p>

<p>The Paris of 1906&mdash;if like London in the
same year, it differed from the Paris and London
of sixty years preceding&mdash;bore now sufficient

<!-- vol 1 page 314 -->

resemblance to its sister capital to
have been taken for a portion of the same city.</p>

<p>It was the close of December, and in its
squares and streets the hum of business had
given way to the feverish agitation of popular
excitement, not a little increased by the vast
affluence of strangers bent only on political
pursuits; and who both outnumbered and carried
away by their undivided earnestness the
Parisian population.</p>

<p>It was one of those occasions on which vast
changes were foreshadowed, not by the tumultuous
brawl of local discontent or partial clamour,
ruffling ephemerally the surface of society&mdash;but
by those indications rather deep
than loud, which growing and gathering,
image the portentous heaving of the ocean's
bosom when stirred by a heavy ground swell.</p>

<p>Thousands upon thousands who had never
before entertained an opinion or idea on politics,
now felt strongly on the subject, and
were urged by prejudice or passion.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 315 -->

<p>Men, who during a great portion of their
lives had been incredulous or indifferent, began
to take a deep interest in passing events.
Old gentlemen who for years had skipped over
politics to seek the police reports, or the horticultural
column, now devoutly read the
leading article of their paper. The exclusive
speculator turned from the price of stocks and
shares to the account of the monster meetings
and important demonstrations. The very
<i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the Parisian club, or coffee house,
who for a quarter of a century had sought
refuge from the discussion of public affairs in
his quiet game and glass of <i>absinthe</i>, now
swallowed down instead of sipping his favourite
beverage, and abandoned his thumb-worn
dominos to hearken with eager attention to the
politician of his circle.</p>

<p>It was one of those occasions, in fact, on
which nations seemed moved by a simultaneous
and almost instinctive impulse, like that which

<!-- vol 1 page 316 -->

renders bees and swallows restless on the eve
of swarming or migration.</p>

<p>Such moved the barbaric tribes which, wavelike,
overwhelmed old Rome's declining Empire&mdash;such
roused the crusading population of
the middle ages, such pervaded the French
nation before its terrible revolution, and such
in 1832, urged the British people to struggle
for that parliamentary reform, the first of
the long series of changes which have influenced,
in their progress, the history of the
world.</p>

<p>It was universally felt, that the crisis was
arrived which had been months, and, indeed,
years preparing.</p>

<p>The prestige with which long uninterrupted
success had invested the Rationalists, and the
belief in the infallibility of this party&mdash;devoutly
entertained by millions disavowing it&mdash;began to
be shaken by the signs of the times. Open
desertion and secret treachery thinned its

<!-- vol 1 page 317 -->

ranks and those, who all their lives had scouted
the idea of <i>Moderate</i> ascendancy now gathered
round the Moderate banner.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious had, in the most masterly manner,
marshalled and organised the
hosts that thronged into his camp.</p>

<p>Hitherto doubtful of his strength, the assaults
he had made year after year upon his adversaries,
had been mere feints&mdash;he was now preparing
to thrust home. The cry was fairly up,
the contest was accepted as one between the
middle classes and the oligarchy of great capitalists.
The bulk of the labouring people had
banded with the opposition. Rationalists and
Moderates had long alike kept down the <i>common
sense men;</i> but Middleman Cautious had
recently confederated with them, skilfully profiting
by the clamorous energy and want of
organisation of their first disenthralment, and
by the confidence with which this conciliatory
conduct had inspired them&mdash;to make his final
attack upon the Rationalist party. Without

<!-- vol 1 page 318 -->

the aid of the middle classes, and in the teeth
of the encouragement afforded by the opposition,
government found itself unable to repress
the popular licence so long unknown in the
United Monarchies.</p>

<p>As the crisis had drawn near, the Moderate
leader had called forth all that was most appalling
in popular excitement&mdash;like a necromancer
conjuring up his confederate spirits
from the depths of pandemonium&mdash;to paralyse
and overawe his adversaries. The millions of
the people were stirred&mdash;the thousands of the
middle classes were agitated&mdash;the hundreds of
the dominant body were threatened with destruction.
The basis and the centre of the
social pyramid, were shaken by a convulsion,
which threatening the whole edifice, seemed
sure to loosen and prostrate its oligarchic
apex.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid, the popular agitator, suspending
his long enmity to the Moderates, for
the purpose of vanquishing one adversary
at a time was, according to the terms of the

<!-- vol 1 page 319 -->

convention he had made, temporarily acting as
the lieutenant of the Moderate chief. He had
harangued at meetings&mdash;he had organised processions
of hundreds of thousands, and he had
moved the masses in the direction, most propitious
to the views of Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>Now all these facts disseminated by the million-tongued
press were known to man, woman
and child, throughout the great city, and expectation
was raised to its highest pitch by
the circumstance that the Moderate leader
was about to introduce that night into the
legislative assembly, the fatal bill which was
to give a death-blow to the long triumphant
oligarchy.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious had that day learned
the defection of old Cash, but as he moved towards
the houses at the head of a procession
of his followers, he found that his star was so
much in the ascendancy as to give him, notwithstanding
this untoward circumstance, the

<!-- vol 1 page 320 -->

assurance of a majority, and the certainty of
success.</p>

<p>On his right hand moved the spokesman of
the waverers who was introduced to the reader
when making his accession conditional on the
co-operation of old Cash; and who, representing
the numerous body of "waiters upon Providence"
had since seen fit openly to declare his
apostacy.</p>

<p>On his left towered the colossal figure of
Invective Rabid, the Democratic chief, as he
strid along with a theatrical air, insolently
protective of his two companions.</p>

<p>The mob cheered, enthusiastically, the
great man of the hour so obviously approved
by their champion, and men of high standing
who six months since would have thought
their respectability compromised by connection
with the moderates, now ostentatiously greeted
him, or joined the ranks of his triumphal
escort.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 321 -->

<p>The municipality of the city itself which
had always been actively hostile to his opinion
now turned abjectly round, and made a most
unconstitutional demonstration by causing the
church bells to be rung and preparations to be
made for an illumination. Meanwhile the Rationalist
party seemed paralysed, and opposed
nothing but passive inactivity to the peril
threatening it. Sir Jasper had, indeed, held
a meeting of his most influential friends, and
it was known that he had secured the co-operation
of old Cash; but this intelligence,
which four-and-twenty hours earlier might
have been decisive, now came too late. Hour
by hour, and minute by minute, fresh defections
took place to the Moderates, even of men
who protested "that nothing would ever have
induced them to change sides, but the obdurate
blindness of leaders who would yield nothing to
the fatal tempest, of which the violence might have
been broken, without any dangerous concession,
by a little pliancy." Such of the Rationalists

<!-- vol 1 page 322 -->

as did not creep quietly into the senate were
greeted by loud hisses and Sir Jasper made
his way thither so thoroughly unperceived
that the report spread without that he intended
to absent himself on this occasion, and
decline the combat. It was not so, however.
The minister was discerned by those
inside the house in his usual place, calm&mdash;collected&mdash;and
though pale, with a complacent
smile upon his countenance.</p>

<p>In 1906 it was no longer customary, as it
had been half a century preceding, to make
extemporaneous appeals to the members of
legislative assembly or to waste upon them
oratorical graces.</p>

<p>In the days of Pym and Hampden, of Mirabeau
and Danton, Pitt and Fox, argument
and rhetoric may still have been powerful in
persuading, but in the middle of the nineteenth
century the veriest parliamentary tyro
was aware that to have hoped ever to see an
M.P. turned aside from his intended vote even

<!-- vol 1 page 323 -->

by the eloquence of a Demosthenes, would
have been as vain as to have expected the conversion
of the Pope to the Wesleyan form of
worship by a twopenny tract, or of the Archbishop
of Canterbury to the Romish faith by
the recitation of a litany.</p>

<p>The speeches made in an age already utilitarian
were therefore addressed not to auditors
whom they were never hoped to influence
but to the country at large, through the
intermedium of the daily press, which in the
fulfilment of its mission not only polished
and gave pith to the effusions of the speakers,
but commonly (for the credit of its peculiar
paper) supplied with them style and grammar,
and often with ideas.</p>

<p>This idle form which in the nineteenth
century outlived the essence of an obsolete
custom&mdash;like the cast iron extinguishers still
attached to area rails, long after the introduction
of gas had consigned the race of

<!-- vol 1 page 324 -->

link-boys to oblivion&mdash;had, in 1906, been long
since banished.</p>

<p>Members then read their written speeches,
of which copies, in different languages, were
handed to the speaker, and electrically transmitted
to the public by an office devoted to
that purpose.</p>

<p>The tone of their delivery was that of a
school-boy reciting his lesson, or of a broker
calling over an inventory, and the sole object
of reading it at all was to enter a formal
declaration that these were the sentiments of
the speaker. This ceremony, which, like kissing
the book, or placing the finger on parchment,
with the words "this is my act and
deed," possessed a certain importance, was
usually gone through with little more unction
or solemnity.</p>

<p>It was hence understood that any answer
which a member might wish to make to the
speech of another must be conveyed on the

<!-- vol 1 page 325 -->

following day. Though no legal prohibition
established the inviolability of this rule its infringement,
except on some most extraordinary
occasion, would never for a moment have been
tolerated, and indeed so many years had
elapsed since it had been attempted that it was
not believed that the custom could ever be
renewed.</p>

<p>It followed from these facts that in 1906
every one anxious to hear and understand
the debates resorted to an expedient already
adopted in 1846 by the <i>cognoscenti</i>&mdash;that of
gathering them in their embellished form beyond
the senate walls, instead of listening to
the speeches as delivered in all the bald reality
of their dishabille.</p>

<p>Indeed the parliamentary veterans themselves,
like soldiers in the ranks, who through
the smoke know little of the progress of the
battle, were in the habit of abandoning their
places when solicitous to learn the effect of a
parliamentary contest.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 326 -->

<p>Let us therefore briefly recapitulate the
events of that struggle as the words of the
speakers were transmitted to, and impressed
upon, the masses without, by means of a vast
dial plate on which every sentence of the
orator appeared as soon as spoke in gigantic
letters, from which, along a thousand branch
lines, it was carried by the electric telegraph
to every part of the United Monarchies, and
diverted at will, like the gas from a main
pipe, into clubs, towns, halls, and places of
entertainment.</p>

<p>The long threatened bill brought in by
Middleman Cautious was to repeal the fundamental
article of the constitution of the United
Monarchies, <i>which limited associations or companies
to five and twenty members or shareholders</i>.
The effect of this enactment had been&mdash;as
every one knew, to throw into the hands of the
senatorial body, the commerce, means of communication,
public works, and all other sources
of wealth of the whole Federative Kingdom.

<!-- vol 1 page 327 -->

It was obvious in an age which recognised the
full value of association of capital that when the
number of members was thus limited all enterprises
requiring a large outlay must remain in
the hands of the great capitalists.</p>

<p>Five and twenty millionaries, by clubbing
each their million, were in consequence enabled
to obtain exclusive possession of canals,
railway lines, banking establishments, and
branches of commerce, without any possible
competition either on the part of individuals
or of the aggregate wealth of the people;
because a hundred millions, scattered amongst
some thousand holders, could never be brought
to bear against five and twenty in the hands
of as many of their body.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious fully exposed and explained
the unjust and pernicious operation of
the existing law in a long and able speech
which derived its appositeness and force, like
many other celebrated political speeches, not
from the fact of its containing any novelty

<!-- vol 1 page 328 -->

but, on the contrary, from the circumstance
that it set forth exactly what the vast majority
knew and believed before upon the subject.</p>

<p>To this restrictive law he attributed all the
evils afflicting the community, the commercial,
manufacturing, and agricultural distress;&mdash;the
misery of the people&mdash;the decline of prosperity
amongst the middle classes, and finally&mdash;by
a providential retribution,&mdash;the shaken credit
of the great capitalists themselves, for whose
sole advantage this state of things had been
established.</p>

<p>"This fatal enactment (he said) had in the age in
which they lived renewed the old Venetian
oligarchy. Vast kingdoms and mighty states,
which considerations of economy and common
sense had united, had in this manner become
the estate of a body consisting of a few hundred
capitalists; whilst the middle class had sunk
into the condition of its overseers and drudges,
and the people had degenerated into its mere serfs.
This state of things&mdash;so unnatural as to have led

<!-- vol 1 page 329 -->

even those whom it was intended to favour to
the verge of bankruptcy&mdash;the nation would no
longer tolerate, and the support he had received,
led him to believe that in proposing a
measure which would give bread to the people,
restore to their former importance the middle
classes of society, and shield the oligarchs from
the consequences of their usurpation&mdash;by calling,
in short, for the abrogation of so iniquitous a law&mdash;he
was speaking the sentiments of an immense
and resolute majority. In fine, he proposed
<i>that an act be passed to allow of the association
of unlimited numbers, providing only that the
individuals associating be eligible to the lower
house</i>."</p>

<p>This proposition was in the highest degree
satisfactory to the middle class, since
none but those who could prove the possession
of ten thousand pounds were qualified to sit in
the Commons, and because when allowed to
combine its resources this vast body would
easily annihilate all the monopolies of the

<!-- vol 1 page 330 -->

millocrats; it was equally gratifying to the
lower orders in this respect, that it was obviously
a death blow to the domination of their
oligarchic tyrants.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious was followed by Invective Rabid.</p>

<p>The speech of the popular orator was a long
diatribe against the millocrats. Every other
sentence was an accusation alternated by an
epigram. All the crimes of every species of
tyranny which history ever had recorded, he
affixed either metaphorically or directly upon
the senatorial body. He painted in formidable
colours the dark array of popular force, its maddening
sense of wrong and energetic resolution.
He threatened all classes with a convulsion,
which should subvert all present social
order, and realise the wildest dreams of communism
and equality, as the implied alternative
of resistance to the present measure.</p>

<p>The speech of the great democrat was only
second in importance to that of Middleman

<!-- vol 1 page 331 -->

Cautious, from the assurance which it gave of
the thorough sympathy with the proposed
measure of that power,&mdash;the people&mdash;which
after so long a torpor in the United Monarchies
was awakening to such threatening
life. That it had carried dismay into the
Rationalist ranks appeared obvious when a
senator rose to answer the last speaker, in an
extemporaneous speech, in violation of all parliamentary
precedent; and the general surprise
was not a little increased when its object appeared
to be a mere personal attack upon Invective
Rabid, without other discernible aim or object.</p>

<p>Lord Lofty, the most dignified of his class,
who had never before been provoked into the
slightest indecorum or the remotest personality,
was most incredibly the person who charged
the popular leader "with gross inconsistency
of action, and opinion&mdash;with glaring treachery
towards the popular cause&mdash;with certain apostacy
and probable venality, <i>since he, contending

<!-- vol 1 page 332 -->

that the people were entitled to so much, was contented
with so trifling a concession!</i>"</p>

<p>There was but one opinion on the impolicy
of this malignant and ill-judged outbreak. It
was looked upon as the vindictive ebullition
into which a despairing party had
been betrayed by the hopelessness of its condition,
and as the surest proof that it had
utterly lost head in its extremity.</p>

<p>What could be more dangerous than for one
used only to the routine of parliamentary forms
to venture upon extemporaneous controversy
with such an antagonist, accustomed to address
popular assemblies, what more rash than to call
down, in such a contest, upon his head the
fervid eloquence of the great agitator.</p>

<p>Thus challenged, Invective Rabid made reply.
The provocation given by his adversary,&mdash;the
indecent violation of parliamentary proprieties,
and the presumptuous rashness of the
attack made by that personage,&mdash;all led his
hearers to anticipate his expected castigation

<!-- vol 1 page 333 -->

with the same feeling that the bystander may
experience when a lion is roused to resent the
bite of an ill-favoured cur, Lashing himself
into fury as he proceeded, the great demagogue
turned upon his assailant all the bitterness
of his sarcasm&mdash;all the vivacity of his biting
wit. His unscrupulous tongue legitimately
loosened, he showed his accuser in a light
alternately ridiculous, contemptible, and
loathsome. Like a wolf in the fold, not
contented with the demolition of his victim,
he left the mark of his fatal fang upon
his party, and then&mdash;when he had ruthlessly torn
and mangled to the full satiation of his impetuous
and ferocious temper&mdash;he rebutted one by one
the calumnies of his accuser, and proceeded in a
flow of impassioned eloquence to vindicate his
stewardship of the people's interest, concluding
by the declaration&mdash;"<i>that he accepted this concession
as an instalment of the great debt of
popular rights withheld</i>."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 334 -->

<p>There was no man unmoved in that unusually
impassible assembly as Invective Rabid
spoke, and all eyes were turned on his accuser
as he winced beneath the terrible recrimination
he had drawn down.</p>

<p>But when the triumphant demagogue had
ceased and turned to gather the applause which scarce suppressed had seemed ready to
burst forth, as he was proceeding&mdash;he saw a
cloud on the brow of Middleman Cautious.
He had been too successful; he had crushed
his adversary, but he had <i>proved too much</i>
and been betrayed into an avowal alarming
to the conservative susceptibilities of his moderate
allies.</p>

<p>At this juncture Sir Jasper rose; a bland
smile which had played upon his features vanished,
but not to give place to any sign of
disquietude or vexation. On the contrary his
manner was all suavity and equanimity. He
first stopped to address a few words to John
Cash, who had taken his seat beside him, but

<!-- vol 1 page 335 -->

this was judged to be only a pantomimic demonstration
of the good understanding between
the minister and his new adherent, and drew
forth from Invective Rabid a slight cheer of
ironical defiance.</p>

<p>In reality Sir Jasper was repeating to old
Cash the preconcerted signal for the delivery
or the postponement of the brief speech prepared
for his influential follower. This done,
he turned to his auditors and opened his
discourse.</p>

<p>No one doubted that it would be eloquent
and able; but few believed that in the present
state of public feeling it could possibly prove
effective, and his auditors were prepared to
see him at best succumb with dignity, and&mdash;so
to say&mdash;gather his senatorial robes around
him to die decently like C&aelig;sar at the foot of
Pompey's statue.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper began&mdash;not by attacking, but by
lauding his chief adversary. He adduced and
praised the arguments of Middleman Cautious

<!-- vol 1 page 336 -->

upon the present question, and attributed to
the moderate leader's able exposition of his
views, the present modification of his own.
"For he frankly owned, that his opinions <i>were</i>
changed, and he stood there boldly to avow
that this change had originated in the convictions
of a political opponent."</p>

<p>He then gave his auditors a succinct account
of his former impressions (a concentration of
the prejudices of his party), of his first suspicion
that they were erroneous, and of the
course of ratiocination which led him to
conviction of their fallacy.</p>

<p>But whilst he paid a just tribute to the
early discernment of a great political truth by
his adversary, he contended "that the conclusions
drawn by him from this truth&mdash;once
established&mdash;were lame and impotent, and he
exposed the chain of reasoning which had led
him not to the same point as Middleman Cautious,
but <span class="smcap">a step beyond into the career
of reform</span>.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 337 -->

<p>"He was convinced that to retain inviolate
the great principle which acknowledged the
rights of property as the first and paramount
duty of society to <i>avoid those radical changes to
which Invective Rabid had avowed that the present
measure was only a stepping-stone</i>, and to render
concession <i>final</i>, that a further stride must be
taken into it, one which would give more
ample security to one portion of the people,
and greater satisfaction to the other.</p>

<p>"He had, therefore, with the consent of the
most influential of his party come down to
the House to give the measure his full support
with this amendment, <i>that the right of association
be not only unlimited as to numbers</i>,
<span class="smcap">but thrown open without qualification
to all the subjects of the united monarchies</span>."</p>

<p>At this announcement, a cheer burst forth
simultaneously from the ministerial and opposition
benches, and from the followers of Invective
Rabid.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 338 -->

<p>It was caught up without&mdash;it spread through
the streets of Paris, and the astounding intelligence
borne by the electric fluid, was conveyed
far and wide, convulsing the inhabitants
of the whole empire as it had convulsed the
astonished capital.</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious felt as if a shot had
passed through his heart and paralyzed its action,
so profound was his vexation.</p>

<p>He knew that he was vanquished in the very
hour of success; and though too game to relinquish
the contest, his head, drooped amidst
the general enthusiasm, for a moment on his
breast in utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>There was only one individual either within
or without those walls, who did not, at this
moment, envy or admire Sir Jasper as the
most successful, able, and profound of living
men&mdash;it was old Cash, still smiling at the political
tutelage assumed over him by the minister,
and feeling as the future protector of England
may have felt in its wordy parliament when he

<!-- vol 1 page 339 -->

began to know the weight of his own sword.
John Cash&mdash;though he had never heard of
Cavaliers or Roundheads&mdash;knew, as he glanced
around him, that the time was inevitably approaching,
when he too, might order the speaker's
mace to be removed as a useless bauble&mdash;for
the monetary Cromwell of the age had
already satisfied himself from Tempest, that
the galvanist had left him sole possessor of
the power which must, eventually, make the
wide world his property.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first burst of surprise was over at the
astounding step taken by Sir Jasper. In the
novel combinations and in the utter confusion
of parties consequent upon this measure, those,
whose belief in the infallibility of their own
political sect had been so violently disturbed,
were now rapidly ranging under one or other
of the two banners.</p>

<p>Such was the state of public opinion that
no degree of previous antagonism could make

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

the adverse leaders despair of enlisting any of
each other's followers.</p>

<p>In the series of political dinners given and
accepted, to which this hope of proselytism
gave rise, Sir Jasper and some of the most
influential personages in the United Monarchies
were invited by John Cash and his
lady.</p>

<p>John Cash, though himself still living until
recently in plebeian simplicity, had many
years since provided for the education and
establishment of his son in a manner fitting
him to take his place among the magnates of
the land.</p>

<p>When therefore he saw fit, as the accepted
representative of property and its rights, to
make a tardy display of the wealth of which
he had hitherto been so unostentatious, the
appearance in circles, chiefly political, of one
who had become an important political character,
and with whose name they had been long
familiar, created but little sensation, except

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

such as the more than regal magnificence in
which he now indulged was calculated to inspire;
for as soon as this man judged it worth
while to change his mode of life at all he had
thought proper to assume a state commensurate
with the prodigious superiority of his fortune.</p>

<p>When however it was understood that a wife,
of whose existence no one had ever heard a word
before, was to be brought upon the scene, to
preside over his princely hospitalities, the most
vivid curiosity was excited, and on her first
appearance she was pronounced to be so outrageously
coarse, vulgar, and arrogant, that
every absurd story illustrative of these peculiarities
was saddled upon her, till she grew
rapidly into such notoriety of ridicule that the
chief leaders of fashion magnanimously resolved
not to admit into their society a woman
calculated to throw so much discredit on their
order.</p>

<p>But a few weeks had widely altered the

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

position of affairs. The growing violence of
the storm which threatened the Rationalists,&mdash;the
alliance of the Cash family with the house
of Lofty,&mdash;the strange revolution occasioned
in the political world by the conduct of Sir
Jasper, and the vast importance derived by
old Cash at this crisis, from the open demonstration
of the extent of his personal influence,
had fully convinced the haughtiest of
his social opponents that he must be conciliated.</p>

<p>Even the most impracticable of the proud
dames whose fiat had hitherto been an irrevocable
sentence of exclusion from the sphere
over which they imperiously presided, yielded
at length less to the entreaties of their husbands
than to the presence of an inevitable
necessity.</p>

<p>Old Cash had found a means of private
coercion as well as of public influence; he
would not rest satisfied with being himself
received&mdash;he was not content with the society

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

of his male colleagues, but he insisted on a
formal recognition of the social equality of his
lady by their wives and daughters; and his
demand had been acceded to.</p>

<p>Only that, as might have been expected from
personages so politic, their compliance, once
determined upon, had been rendered as graceful
and natural as possible, instead of being doggedly
abrupt, so as to resemble rather a spontaneous
impulse than a forced concession.</p>

<p>The wealth and power of the Cashes were
loudly bruited&mdash;the vulgarity attributed to
his wife was softened into eccentricity&mdash;and
she was represented as a lady much maligned
by authorities so high, that the promulgators
began to disavow the jokes and stories they
had circulated respecting her.</p>

<p>On the occasion in question, the chief political
celebrities favourably inclined to Sir
Jasper, and the <i>elite</i> of fashion almost exclusively
ranged under his banner, had accepted

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

of the hospitality of John Cash and his
spouse.</p>

<p>The palace of the millionary&mdash;it was still
called an <i>h&ocirc;tel</i>&mdash;occupied the site of the
former "<i>Opera Comique</i>," opposite to the
<i>Bourse</i>, which was then undergoing reconstruction
at his private cost.</p>

<p>Beneath this roof had been collected&mdash;or
rather crowded&mdash;all that was most valuable,
rare, and beautiful in art, whether of the
kind which appeals to admiration of the gorgeous
and the costly&mdash;to the mere acquisitive
instinct and love of hue, fabric and symmetry,
which man shares with the bee and
magpie&mdash;or whether of that higher order,
(which, rising above the mere disposition of
form and colour constituting taste,) aspires to
ideality of beauty, or attains the truthfulness
of nature.</p>

<p>The dyer, weaver, and founder&mdash;the mosaist,
sculptor, and painter, had each done their

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

utmost to complete the work of the architect.</p>

<p>Old Cash knew well that money would
procure him taste in all these branches, and
had given to the most competent judges,
instructions to procure, regardless of expense
all that was most beautiful in each. But no presiding
genius had combined and harmonised
the whole&mdash;and hence the upholsterer, weaver,
founder, mosaist, painter and sculptor, had
struggled each to outvie the other, to the detriment
of the whole.</p>

<p>The dazzling light of golden chandeliers of
Florentine workmanship, fell in streams upon
an exquisitely sculptured marble stair-case
carpeted, as it were, by a broad band of the
most brilliant mosaic work, and adorned by
celebrated statues and pictures, multiplied
almost to satiety, and intermingled with a wild
profusion of velvet and tapestry, and unheard
of mirrors, and amber, and lapis lazuli, and
gold&mdash;in the apartments through which were

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

ushered the curious guests who came that day to
do homage to the power they had so long resisted.</p>

<p>If the taste of this sumptuous mansion&mdash;like
that of many royal palaces in the past century,
did not wholly correspond with its magnificence&mdash;there
was nothing sufficiently
jarring or incongruous, to neutralise the respect
inspired by the display of so many treasures.</p>

<p>At least, both the feminine celebrities, to
whom that most fastidiously selected company
deferred&mdash;the two suns shining, notwithstanding
Shakspere, in one sphere, maintained a discouraging
gravity when appealed to by the satirical
glances of those amongst the party disposed
to criticise. The Lady Sabina&mdash;swan-like and
majestic&mdash;if we can conceive majesty in the
dark swan, was a type of the traditional patrician&mdash;such
old as Rome and Venice, and proud
England once possessed&mdash;and as such other countries
never witnessed&mdash;a peculiar stamp of calm,

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

cold, regal consciousness, which we seek vainly,
even in the brilliant nobility of France, or the
proud aristocracy of Germany, or in any land or
period, chivalrous or courtly, excepting those in
which limited oligarchies have shared exclusively
the sovereign power.</p>

<p>The Lady Sabina had long been in one sense
an impersonation of the spirit of her time, or
at least of that recent spirit so rapidly changing&mdash;though
in another she perhaps sinned
against it by too much admixture of the pride
of blood, an ingredient of the old patrician
character repulsive to the oligarchy of mere
wealth which was being now so fiercely assailed
by the middle classes.</p>

<p>The vast fortune, great political influence
and irreproachable name of a husband, unreservedly
pliable to her wishes, but whom she
guided with sufficient tact to preserve his character
from ridicule&mdash;a dignity of speech and
manner perfectly unaffected&mdash;a figure and
features gracefully imposing or irreproachable

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

in their regularity&mdash;an ambition determined in
its nature and definite in its aim&mdash;the classic
purity of her taste, and the simplicity
of her manners, had all conduced to render her
one of the two orbs of light whom the votaries
of fashion worshipped.</p>

<p>Her rival&mdash;if those could be called rivals
who were anxious to disclaim all rivalry,
was younger at least in aspect.</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe looked rather an aristocratic
maiden than a patrician matron.</p>

<p>Slender and fair, she recalled those archly
smiling beauties whose dimpled charms the
painters of the Eighteenth Century have rather
idealised than reproduced, surrounding them
with loves whose tinted wings seem heavy&mdash;flowers
whose cerulean blue appears too
harsh&mdash;beside complexions, with whose softness
nothing would harmonise well but the
lily of the valley or white jessamine or pale
magnolia.</p>

<p>This exceeding delicacy was enlivened by a

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

sparkling wit&mdash;a brilliant fluency of language
and an inexpressible charm in all she said or
did, which never belied the exquisitely feminine
expression of her fair features.</p>

<p>If the Lady Sabina impersonated majestic
dignity, her tender rival typified grace and
wit.</p>

<p>She too had reigned and ruled, but if the
Lady Sabina sought, through the culture of
fashion to make converts to her political views,
the Lady Floranthe, her rival, had long
seen in politics nothing but a means of extending
the domain of fashion.</p>

<p>The Lady Sabina seemed to glory in an
adolescent daughter with whom she was incessantly
seen, though too bigotted to etiquette
ever to intrude her on society. The Lady
Floranthe, on the contrary, now kept out of
sight the idolised child, which in violation of
all ceremonial forms she had so frequently
paraded before its froward growth began to

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

tell tales of its mother's age. Not that she
sought to make any allusion to herself upon
this subject, or ignored that the July of life,
if adding to the attractions of her rival, would
be fatal to her own&mdash;as the maturity which
may become the Juno and Cybele to the graces
of an Aphrodite&mdash;nor yet that she was unaware
that this July was rapidly overtaking
her.</p>

<p>Far from it&mdash;she was keenly sensitive upon
this point, and hence before the rough hand of
time had effaced one iota of her youthful
bloom, resolved to maintain her Empire in a
novel character, and start not as a political
but as a social champion.</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe was nominally a Rationalist,
and she had no wish to disturb the
present relations of existing classes&mdash;it was
only between the two sexes that she interfered
to advocate the rights of woman, and
even feminine pre-eminence, an advocacy she

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

found few disposed to contend with in her
person.
Now these unimpeachable authorities&mdash;whose
acquiescence with the exigencies of old
Cash rendered it idle for any recusant of the
fashionable world to remain rebellious&mdash;were
tacitly agreed to make the best of their submission,
and both affected a warm friendship
for Eustatius&mdash;long since enrolled amongst
their followers&mdash;together with an intense interest
in his youthful bride, the link uniting
with the patrician body this powerful family
aspiring to its honours.</p>

<p>The influence of the Lady Calliro&euml; over her
father-in-law, the power this influence gave
her, and her extraordinary beauty, had in truth
made each of these dames hope to meet with
a confederate, and dread to find a rival in her.</p>

<p>These, with the husband of the Lady Sabina,
the bishop already introduced to the reader,
Lord Besom and a few other personages&mdash;all

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

of political celebrity&mdash;were the guests who had
first assembled to do honour to the banquet.</p>

<p>The hall in which they were received&mdash;not
by the hostess, but the host&mdash;bore evidence of
far more purity of taste in its decoration than
the preceding apartments, and here the agency
of a more refined intelligence was already
discernible in the unequivocal traces of the
Lady Calliro&euml;'s interference.</p>

<p>The absence of the mistress of the mansion,
whose place was not even supplied by her
daughter-in-law, might under other circumstances
have been deemed offensive, it was now
only suggestive of surprise, and of the
thought that perhaps after all she had declined
the awful trial; but all incertitude on this
point was quickly removed by old Cash, who
after a bluff welcome confessed that,</p>

<p>"To be plain spoken, though his wife had
been dressed an hour, she was not down
because she had promised her son Tat, not to

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

come in till he or his wife were there, for fear
she should make a fool of herself. Tat was
not come nor his lady neither, so he would
order in his better half without any more
ado."</p>

<p>The guests glanced at each other, but the
Lady Sabina, without the discomposure of a
muscle, said soothingly,</p>

<p>"Mr. Cash, your lady is perhaps accustomed
to seclusion, but she should not agitate herself
to receive her <i>friends</i>."</p>

<p>"Your wife," said the Lady Floranthe,
"seems as modest as you are frank."</p>

<p>Old Cash looked hard at the last speaker,
and then replied,</p>

<p>"Yes, I am plain spoken, my heart is
always on the tip of my tongue, and my wife
is perhaps too bashful, as you may judge, for
here she comes."</p>

<p>Wide flew a pair of folding doors, opposite
to those which the guests had entered&mdash;though
none too wide as in sailed&mdash;like a broad

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

beamed East Indiaman shaving the narrow
sluice-gates of a dock&mdash;the envied partner of
the modern Cr&oelig;sus, just as Lord Besom was
observing as if he had been appealed to,</p>

<p>"A remarkable woman&mdash;a distinguished
personage&mdash;very. "</p>

<p>The wife of John Cash was incontestibly a
distinguished personage in the literal acceptation
of that term, since there was no society
which she would not deeply have impressed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash was more than fat, more than
forty, and decidedly more than fair, because her
complexion rather resembled the deep hues of
an angry sunset than the blush of awakening
Aurora.</p>

<p>If there be no object in nature more repulsive
than a coarse and vulgar woman, it was
impossible to find in nature a woman more
coarse and vulgar than the heroine of this description.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash could only be appropriately described
as <i>huge</i>. Her bulk was not softened

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

in its outline by any of those mellow curves
by which obesity is commonly characterised.
She was at once overgrown and angular, because
her figure&mdash;fresh from the despairing
efforts of the ministers of her toilet&mdash;might
have been likened to those pieces of foreign
<i>boulli</i> protruding in all sorts of shapes through
the net-work of pack-thread in which "for consistency's
sake" it is served upon foreign
tables.</p>

<p>The proportions of her build and features
would have befitted a gigantic drayman, though
exhibiting instead of the plethorically dull expression
of the latter the more vivacious
characteristics of those mermaids of prosaic
life&mdash;the shrimp catcher and bathing woman.</p>

<p>Her eyes were deep sunken, her swollen
features indicative of a certain amount of good
nature united to a hasty disposition, or perhaps
it should be confessed to&mdash;habitual wrathfulness.</p>

<p>The skin of her throat hung down in a

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

truly vaccine fold, its fiery surface, studded
by a few warts,&mdash;each bristling with hairs like
a desert oasis with its palms, whilst the decidence
of her thick under lip, if not exactly
resembling, recalled that distinctive beauty of
the mastiff and blood-hound kinds&mdash;the
dewlap,&mdash;so many degrees less attractive in a feminine
physiognomy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash was, besides, still as remarkable
for the redness of her arms, the gallinaceous
appearance of her fingers, and the energy of
her vocal organs, as when fifteen years before
she had presided over her "good man's" store
awing the whole neighbourhood by her vituperative
powers, as she weighed out rags, bones,
and bottles.</p>

<p>Let the reader now imagine this personage
decked out in a low bodied, short-sleeved dress
of the most intense scarlet satin, a gauze
turban, of the brightest yellow surmounting
that piece of capillary deception which she
called her <i>front</i>, and whence descended between

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

two bandeaus a single flaxen curl in the
middle of her forehead,&mdash;terrifically valuable
jewelry&mdash;rings ponderous as the seal of Solomon,
and gloves turned up and wetted at the finger-ends
by a habit in which she commonly indulged
of pulling them off with her teeth.</p>

<p>If anything could have added to the ridicule
of her appearance this addition was made in
the form of a single <i>bouquet</i> of modest white
violets on her bosom, typical of retiring simplicity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash, leaving her companion a little
in the rear, raised up her dress as if about
to step across the kennel, till she rendered distinctly
visible a splay foot which if not ornamental,
was an undeniably useful extremity in as
much as it might amply have supported even
two bodies,&mdash;and advanced bravely into the
middle of the apartment at a pace peculiar to
herself, and which could only be appropriately
expressed in her own idiom in the

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

vocabulary of which she designated it as
"trudging."</p>

<p>It would be a great mistake to suppose that
she was anything abashed. This worthy
lady, like a traveller who goes to sleep at the
foot of a mountain, and ignorant of the difficulties
overcome, awakens on its summit, had
overstepped too suddenly and easily the infinitude
of social gradations between its lowest
and its highest ranks, to have been inspired
with much respect for her present exalted
station.</p>

<p>Years after her husband's rise from retail
trade of the most vile description, to the possession
of vast capital, she had continued still
her former mode of life. She had, indeed,
consented to the removal of her son, for this
most unfeminine of women possessed two most
woman-like attributes, her profound maternal
affection and vivid conjugal jealousy; but the
only result of this sacrifice had been to make

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

her son shun the mother, of whom he had
become ashamed.</p>

<p>It was in the hope of enjoying more of his
society she had recently resolved to obtain
admission to circles which appeared to have so
many attractions for him, and where she
shrewdly made her account to keep, at
the same time, a watchful eye over the seductions
to which she doubted not that her spouse
was incessantly exposed.</p>

<p>The first glance of this lady, far, therefore,
from indicating anything like bashfulness, was
one of maternal solicitude, which soon merged
into an expression of wrathful anxiety when
she perceived the absence of her son.</p>

<p>At this moment, her companion transmitted
to her a message from the groom of the chambers
at which her countenance cleared, and she
advanced towards her company, curtseying low
to each as they were named by her husband, for
she had no previous acquaintance with any one
but Lord Besom.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

<p>The resolute, good breeding of her guests,
soon placed her at her ease. They talked
to her of her daughter and of her son&mdash;and
they admired her statues, pictures, and objects
of virt&ugrave;.</p>

<p>"This is a lovely Claude," observed the
Lady Sabina.</p>

<p>"Clawed?" asked the millionary's wife, with
a keen glance; and then she added, critically,
"The frame <i>is</i> lovely, but the picture I should
rather say was <i>dabbed</i> than <i>clawed</i>. We have
some scratchings or etchings by Remembrance,
you might call those <i>clawed</i> indeed."</p>

<p>"Madam," suggested her companion, <i>sotte
voce:</i> "Claude&mdash;C-l-a-u-d-e, is the name
of the painter, and you mean Rembrandt's
etchings."</p>

<p>"Smithers, speak when you are spoken to,"
replied her mistress audibly. "I give you
your salary and my cast off clothes to supply
'my deficiencies,' as my son says, not to contradict
me before company."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

<p>Smithers was silent; but the lady was not
to be propitiated even by her silence, for she
continued in a louder key,</p>

<p>"Teach me to spell, indeed! I wonder you
do not bring out the alphabet&mdash;you really
grow unbearable. I should begin to know
something about pictures and <i>statutes</i> too by
this time. I have more of them of my own,
all bought and paid for, than you ever saw before,
I fancy?"</p>

<p>Smithers looked timidly round, but was relieved
to find Eustatius absent; because, menaced
by him with instant dismissal, if neglecting
to correct one of his mother's errors;
and often threatened with an equal penalty
at the hands of that irascible lady when she
did.</p>

<p>"All the world envies you your works of
art," observed the Lady Sabina.</p>

<p>"There is that last collection," chimed in
Lord Besom, "a few of the most exquisite

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

gems selected for the private gratification of our
hostess."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Mrs. Cash, expansively. "You
mean those in my <i>boudwaw</i>. You have seen
my <i>boudwaw</i>, my Lord? Now Smithers had
no fingers in the arrangement of that, neither
as regards the making nor the mending. It
was fitted up at Tat's desire by a great artist&mdash;you
said when you saw it that its taste was
classical and chaste, and it has been improved
since then. Would you like to see my <i>boudwaw</i>,
ladies?"</p>

<p>Nothing would delight me more," replied
the Lady Floranthe, "I have heard of its
treasures."</p>

<p>"Then, come along," replied Mrs. Cash,
leading the way. "No, Smithers, you need
not look at me&mdash;I know what I am about, and
we can do without you."</p>

<p>"Not to give the history of your gems?"
significantly suggested the companion. "To
save you the trouble, madam?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

<p>"Not for any purpose. I learned them all
by heart, and can explain all about them, as
well as you could do."</p>

<p>"I am sure that any explanation of works
so widely celebrated&mdash;excepting such as you
might condescend to furnish, would be quite
superfluous?" observed Lord Besom, maliciously.
"And you, my lord bishop&mdash;are you not one
of us?"</p>

<p>"Come," said the mistress of the mansion to
the clerical dignitary, who had joined the
group, and whispered, that, at least, Dannecker's
famous Ariadne, was amongst the treasures
of that boudoir. "Come, on my warranty.
There is nothing improper in my
collection now, though you being a prelude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A prelate!" said the bishop, blandly.</p>

<p>"You being a prelate, were right to be wary
of Lord Besom's invitation, who, I am afraid,
is a sad dog, as you once told me."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

<p>"As I told you, madam?" said the astonished
bishop.</p>

<p>"As you told me. Do you think I would fib
about it? If it comes to that, you said he was
a wicked man!"</p>

<p>"Oh! madam! You must have misunderstood
me strangely."</p>

<p>"At least, you told me that he was
once vicious," persisted Mrs. Cash; "You
did, as sure as I hope to be a blessed
angel!"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! What is this little touch of
Christian charity?" said Lord Besom.</p>

<p>"Never! madam, as a Christian and a man!
Never as I live by bread!"</p>

<p>"Here, on this very spot," reiterated the
hostess, who was growing irate. "Here as I
live on drink and victuals! Last Friday week
I asked you if you knew Lord Besom&mdash;a
pleasant man; and you replied that you had been
intimate with him when he was a <i>vicious</i>
chancellor."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

<p>"Vice-Chancellor!" exclaimed the relieved
bishop, with a smothered laugh.</p>

<p>The Ladies Sabina and Floranthe, looked at
each other; the cold, lizard-like eye of Old
Cash, conversing with a distant group,
was upon them. Though inwardly convulsed,
each felt, that whoever yielded to the irresistible
temptation might incur his enmity and would
cede all chance of influence to a rival; and hence
the countenance of each remained impassible,
only the Lady Floranthe, anxious to
give a colour to the laughter threatening to explode,
observed,</p>

<p>"You have mistaken each other's meaning&mdash;the
Vice-Chancellor is a legal dignitary under
the Chancellor. It was advantageous both to
our friend, Lord Besom, and to the law,
when he was enabled to drop the <i>vice</i> from
his title&mdash;but I do not know, Mrs. Cash, whether
he has quite as certainly expunged it from
his morals."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

<p>"Oh, I am to be the scape goat?" whispered
Lord Besom, "well, as you will," and the
party proceeded to the boudoir.</p>

<p>It was far too vast in its proportions, though
scarcely so perhaps for its colossal inmate.</p>

<p>Dome-shaped&mdash;it was covered with a
carpet, in which pale blue predominated,
representing Amphitrite and her sister
Nereids. The satin cushions and hangings
were a pale sea-blue. Its walls were
encrusted with pure mother of pearl, on
which corals were fantastically wreathed;
it had no adornments but enormous vases of
the most translucent crystal filled with flowers,
and some half dozen niches, shell-formed and
covered with a pink enamel to imitate, on a
gigantic scale, the inside of those habitations
of the tenants of the deep. In each of these
niches was one of the most exquisite groups
of statues which ancient or modern art had ever
given to the world, and on which the refraction
of pale pink was calculated to shed a roseate

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

tint, giving warmth to that marble which
the sculptor seemed to have endowed with
life already. Only that this effect was disguised
from the beholder's eyes by so incredibly
ludicrous a contrivance that the very spirit of
woe must have laughed outright at it through its
tears. Mrs. Cash had judged the nudity of
her statues improper, and, without consulting
Smithers, had, through the agency of her
lady's maid, clothed them not only 'decently'
but 'tastily,' as she expressed it.</p>

<p>The antique Venus Praxiteles was arrayed
in a long robe; the famous Antinous slumbered
in a theatrical tunic, "for it did not matter,"
as Mr. Cash informed the bishop, "for
him to show his legs;" Dannecker's Ariadne,
was covered up in a habit less low-bodied,
or short-sleeved, than that of her
possessor, who observed dogmatically "that
we did not live in the time of Queen Godiva,"
whom she evidently held to be one of the
most popular sovereigns who had ever graced

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

these realms. Love and Psyche&mdash;also Dannecker's
charming work&mdash;were quite as comfortably
clothed, the wings of Love protruding
through two neatly fitted holes in a sort of
Italian Bandit's jacket. There was only the
celebrated modern St. Barbara whose marble
drapery had rendered unnecessary supplementary
garments; but the two cherubin descending
with the palm and wreath (more
complete in their embodiment than those whom
in the holy legend St. Peter vainly requested
to be seated) had been complimented with a
pair of drawers a-piece.</p>

<p>"Simple, classical, and <i>chaste</i>, I think I
may call it," said Mrs. Cash, looking round
her self-complacently, and then, as no one
could trust themselves to answer, she continued,
turning to the St. Barbara:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the famous statue of a saint who
was so good that when she died they cut her
out in stone, and sold her to my husband for a

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

swinging price, and these are little cupids
frisking over her!"</p>

<p>"These are not cupids," observed the
bishop with edifying gravity, "but cherubim,
and she became famous in the Romish Church
as a martyr."</p>

<p>"Well, you may be right; they may be
cherubim; but if they cut her out in stone
because she was a martyr, they may do the
same some day by me, who am myself a
martyr."</p>

<p>"To love?" asked Lord Besom.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;we have all our little ailments,&mdash;to
shortness of breath, corns, and the tooth-ache.
This," she continued, turning to
another niche, "is the Harry what's its name,
oh, Harry Adney, for she has a man's name&mdash;and
not amiss for such a hoyden."</p>

<p>"And what," asked Lord Besom "is the
history of Ariadne whom Dannecker has seated
on an upholsterer's lion?"</p>

<p>"Ariadne was daughter of the King of

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

Crete, famous for having been abandoned," interrupted
the bishop hastily, to forestall some
fresh absurdity.</p>

<p>"Very like that she <i>was</i> an <i>abandoned</i> woman,"
replied Mrs. Cash; "to the best of my
knowledge, her husband ran away from her, and
little wonder, if she would ride about on rampant
beasts without a stitch of clothing."</p>

<p>"And this?" said the Lady Floranthe, who
felt suffocating.</p>

<p>"This," replied Mrs. Cash, "this&mdash;stop a
minute&mdash;is Love and Physicky, or rather," she
added, correcting herself and looking at the
bishop, "this is Physicky and a cherubim.
That is the cherubim with the wings."</p>

<p>"Psyche and Love, or Psyche and a cupid,"
said the bishop.</p>

<p>"When I called it a cupid you said it was
a cherubim, now I call it a cherubim you say
it is a cupid; you put me out, my lord, I
might as well have Smithers with me," replied
the hostess petulantly, and then leading them

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

to another niche, where a female figure chained
to a rock and quite as fully habited, sat with
its marble feet bathed by a marble wave, she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is Andromeda."</p>

<p>"The famous work of the same sculptor
who carved the Saint Barbara," said the Lady
Sabina a little relieved; but Lord Besom, as
usual, bent on mischief, asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I fear that she was not much better than
Ariadne, to have taken her ease in such a state
of nature that your sense of propriety has
obliged you to furnish her with clothing."</p>

<p>"No, I never heard that," replied Mrs.
Cash, "you see, poor thing, she was bathing&mdash;I
forget her story; but they have tied
her to a rock and stolen her clothes, I
dare be sworn. How could she help it? perhaps
she thought those bathing machines,
as I used to do, an awful imposition. This
lad asleep is much like the others&mdash;for
your sculptors seem to have brought their

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

figures mostly into the world like their own
mothers, without a rag upon 'em&mdash;this lad, a
king of Sweden paid many thousand pounds
for. It is young what's his name&mdash;not Anthony&mdash;no
let me see, my memory was better
twenty years ago&mdash;stay, I have it, that is
young Antimony."</p>

<p>At this misnomer another pause followed;
and no one dared look the other in the face,
till at length the Lady Floranthe made a
desperate effort and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the statue on which&mdash;whilst Canova
still lived, and Thorwalsden flourished&mdash;some
seventy years ago, the famous Dannecker
placed his hand and said enthusiastically,
"It breathes!"</p>

<p>"Why, what a fool!" exclaimed Mrs. Cash,
"to expect breath from a stone."</p>

<p>This last sally, though no more absurd than
the preceding, proved the crowning feather
which, added to so many previous causes,
at length triumphed over the gravity of her

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

visitors. The object of the mirth, which they
could no longer quite conceal, now faced her
guests with a mantling visage and a flashing
eye; but at this moment the storm was averted
by the appearance of old Cash and the Lady
Calliro&euml;, towards whom she turned, on perceiving
that she was unaccompanied by Eustatius,
with an expression of undisguised solicitude
and disappointment.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; had to explain that her
husband was indisposed, and then in the same
breath to reassure his mother.</p>

<p>In reality, she was thus late, because she
had been endeavouring, to the last minute,
to overcome the repugnance of Eustatius&mdash;who,
painfully sensitive to the absurdities
of his mother, could not bring himself to encounter
the exhibition which he dreaded must
ensue.</p>

<p>The daughter of the senator saw, at a
glance, the cause of the company's merriment
and of her mother-in-law's indignation, and

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

felt for a moment, overwhelmed by the stupendous
ridicule of the transformation which
had occasioned it.</p>

<p>From that boudoir she had striven perseveringly
to banish the crimson, purple, gold,
and ormolu, with which the outrageous taste
of its possessor had gaudily adorned it, substituting
for it her own&mdash;and yet this substitution
had been rendered in the course of a
few hours a thousand fold more ridiculous
than before.</p>

<p>But, rapidly recovering her self-possession,
she repulsed the glance of sympathetic pity
with which the Lady Floranthe sought to ingratiate
herself.</p>

<p>"Our hostess," said Lady Sabina, deprecatingly;
"has been indulging in a practical pleasantry."</p>

<p>"At least," replied the Lady Calliro&euml;, "she
has furnished us with a practical moral lesson.
When we observe how utterly the ideal
beauty of these figures is lost and hidden by

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

the garments covering them, we cannot but
reflect how easily a superficial exterior may
conceal alike deformity or worth, and may
learn from the example of these statues,
how readily it may render excellence
ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Or rather," said old Cash, sturdily, "not
to mince the matter, if you had been bred up
like my Bess, you would know more of dips
than of works of art; but she will learn more
about it in time, for she shall have the finest
in the world to practise on. Come, Betty, why
don't we dine?" The hostess who had just
wiped a silent tear in the corner of her eye at
the defection of her son, which the poor
mother understood, now drew herself up with
as much dignity as she could assume, and
replied,</p>

<p>"Mr. Cash! you forget that we are waiting,
for Sir Jasper; you would not have us sit
down without the <i>prima donna?</i>"</p>

<p>At this mistake the company made another

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

violent effort upon themselves, but the Lady
Calliro&euml; looked haughtily impassible, and old
Cash, with a humorous twinkle in his small grey
eye which travelled searchingly from visage to
visage, as much as to say, laugh if you dare,
replied,</p>

<p>"You mean the premier, my dear; but I
cannot wait dinner even for a minister."</p>

<p>Strange to say in that party the personages
most embarrassed, were&mdash;with the exception of
Lord Lofty&mdash;not those who had cause to blush
for the vulgarity and ignorance of Mrs. Cash,
but on the contrary her guests, who began to
feel, in all its humiliation, the necessity of
courting such companionship.</p>

<p>The lady herself was shielded in the triple
armour of unsuspecting complacency.</p>

<p>Old Cash, whose son had vainly attempted
to dissuade him from introducing her into the
gay world, though keenly sensible of the
figure cut by his wife, was really glorying
in its absurdity, because he felt its intensity

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

to be the measure of his own triumph over the
proud magnates and their dames, whom he
had forced to cultivate her intimacy.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; was beginning to divine
and share the feeling of her father-in-law.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">A POLITICAL DINNER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> length the guests were duly seated in the
dining hall. The bishop had been placed next
to Mrs. Cash, and kept her occupied according
to his instructions. The mischievous Lord Besom
was as far as possible removed from her,
and out of deference to Lord Lofty, and awe
of old Cash, the conversation was kept studiously
from becoming general, an arrangement

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

which enabled this ceremonious repast to proceed
without the interruption of any startling
impropriety except such as was exhibited in
the frequency and depth of the potations of
their hostess, or the uncouth manner in which
she gratified&mdash;for there appeared no chance of
her ever satisfying&mdash;her enormous appetite.</p>

<p>There exists indeed no word expressive of
its animal voracity, unless we borrow from the
German the term <i>aufschlucken</i>, applied in that
tongue to the boa-constrictor and perhaps only
applicable besides to the <i>habitu&eacute;'s</i> of a German
<i>table d'hote</i>.</p>

<p>This halcyon serenity was at length interrupted
by Mrs. Cash, who having become a
shade redder in the face from repletion, and
being apparently bored by the charitable efforts
of her neighbour to amuse her, addressed
herself in a voice commanding general
attention across the table to the Lady Sabina.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

<p>"Would you not like the <i>temperance</i> of this
room lowered a few degrees?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, pray lower the temperature," said
the agonised Lord Lofty, hurriedly, endeavouring
by his quickness to cover this mistake.</p>

<p>The Lady Sabina bowed, and on a sign a
stream of cooler air enveloped all the guests,
whereupon Mrs. Cash complacently remarked
in the same key.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say that I do love all that
is refreshing. I have even ordered all my
servants never to appear without buckets as
you see."</p>

<p>Every eye was turned enquiringly on the
well tutored footmen, who cast down their eyes
respectfully without relaxing one muscle of
their features.</p>

<p>"Buckets!" exclaimed Lord Besom in an
under tone to Sir Jasper. "Does she take us
for white bears watered every fifteen minutes
in the dog days?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

<p>"No," softly ventured the Lady Floranthe,
alluding to the scarlet satin and yellow gauze,
"a precaution against the inflammatory hue of
her attire."</p>

<p>"Ah, well a day!" continued Mrs. Cash,
leaning back in her chair, and profiting by
the general silence to address the company at
large. "How times <i>is</i> changed. When I
was a lass what posies I did gather when the
May was flowering and the corn fields filled
with poppies! and though for twenty years I
never cast eyes on a green field from June till
Michaelmas there was not one blessed summer
that I had not my nosegay of stocks or wall-flowers
in the broken jug upon my window
sill&mdash;and now fashion obliges us to give our
buckets to our footmen, and be content with a
single flower or a tiny bunch like this which
looks to my idea as if we couldn't afford
larger."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cash," said Sir Jasper, anxious to cut
short this meditative retrospection of his

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

hostess, "let me revive that pleasing ceremony
of our hearty ancestors not yet quite obsolete&mdash;like
so much that is excellent and old&mdash;allow
me to take wine with you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," replied Mrs. Cash, who
had reached a stage of jollity, "I have had
my jorum. I only hold five pints, and
Smithers keeps tale of the measure. I wink
at her, and she shows the score upon her
fingers. If I take more I become&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Lord Lofty made a desperate but ineffectual
effort to interpose, for she added in a
voice which rose high above his own.</p>

<p>"I become unpleasant to myself. For as
my doctor says, 'beware of all excess, but
at the same time keep up the stigma.' "</p>

<p>"The stamina," suggested her companion
in a whisper, more audible than her natural
voice.</p>

<p>"I mean the stammerer," added Mrs. Cash.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; now made a diversion.
The dessert was just replacing the last course,

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

and she beckoned for the music which in 1906
was an accompaniment to every formal banquet.</p>

<p>All the first musicians and singers in the
world congregated then in Paris had been engaged
regardless of cost by old Cash for that
occasion, and the manager of the Opera was
at that moment vainly endeavouring to calm
the auditory, who perforce must wait till the
retirement of the ladies from the table of the
millionary allowed the artistic stars whom he
had corrupted to fulfil their engagement
towards the public.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said the Lady Calliro&euml;,
as the melodious notes of an unseen vocalist
burst upon their ear. "That is not Myrrah."</p>

<p>At this observation, a note was put into her
hand, and as it was no longer in 1906 the
custom to ask permission to peruse your own
letters, she broke the seal and read.</p>

<p>Her cheek flushed crimson, her eye flashed
with indignation, and crushing together the

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

note, and the check which fell from the same
envelope, she remained mute with anger.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; having felt a singular curiosity
to hear and see this celebrated Myrrah,
had forwarded to her through the seneschal the
magnificent donation by which her father-in-law
bribed the attendance of her class.</p>

<p>Myrrah had refused&mdash;the seneschal had urged
the personal wish of the millionary's daughter,
whereupon the actress, affecting compliance,
had returned the proffered sum direct to the
Lady Calliro&euml; with these cutting words.</p>

<p>"The undersigned returns through the intermedium
of the Lady Calliro&euml; Cash, the inclosed
check to her father-in-law, and begs
she will inform him, that as the son could not
buy so the father cannot hire her.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Myrrah</span>."</p>

<p>At this insult&mdash;another added to so
many humiliations&mdash;her spirit forsook her
for a moment. At length she reflected:&mdash;"Yes,
this reckless woman speaks truly&mdash;but

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

if bought where is the price
paid for me? Do I endure all this for the idle
display which only makes more glaring the
ridicule and degradation of this marriage. No!
since I have been bought the price of my
purchase shall not be that wealth which the
courtesan refuses&mdash;but power.</p>

<p>Somewhat to the surprise of all present the
Lady Calliro&euml; soon after turned the conversation
boldly upon politics, which had tacitly
been reserved till the retirement of the ladies,
or till the conclusion of the repast. The Lady
Floranthe seized the opportunity with some
eagerness, and Sir Jasper was led frankly to
express his satisfaction "at the auspicious omen
afforded by the presence of the distinguished
guests assembled at that table, and especially
of those friends whose co-operation a temporary
misconception had estranged."</p>

<p>"I think," said old Cash, "that we need
dread no further differences of opinion. The
great concession made to the people was unavoidable;
but&mdash;as I learned when I had no

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

other sugar plums&mdash;there is a bag of honey
next to the sting in every bee. We shall take
care, I promise you, on this occasion to obtain
the most solemn confirmation of the rights
of property. This consideration has satisfied
me; and if I am satisfied I don't know who
should say nay or who has more to lose?"</p>

<p>"After all," said the Lady Sabina, "as my
husband contends, 'we must do the best for
the dignity and interests of our order.' Less
well informed as to the perils threatening it
than Sir Jasper, we judged that he was abandoning
prematurely a not untenable position.
The expression of public opinion has undeceived
us, and he has now our candid support,
in the firm belief that he is acting for
the best."</p>

<p>The husband of the Lady Sabina, who never
contended anything, bowed approvingly in answer
to the well acted look of deferential
appeal cast at him by his wife.</p>

<p>"For my own part," said the Lady Floranthe,

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

"I have no defection to acknowledge.
If hitherto it has been too much the custom of
politicians to use woman's influence, woman's
tact, or woman's art to further their designs,
and yet ostensibly to repudiate her alliance,
Sir Jasper has made the <i>amende honorable</i>, and
I am free to avow that in my estimation he
was never greater than in that proud moment
when, before the representatives of this great
monarchy, he ventured on that hazardous expedient
which has convulsed the political
world with wonderment. I saw him as he
rose humiliated, like King Henry, by the
multitude's intolerable pity&mdash;I marked him
overleap at one bound that step dividing the
ridiculous from the sublime, like a god raising
his footsteps from the slime of earth into the
altitude of heaven. I know of no situation
more sublime in history than that exhibited
by the hero of our present suffrage upon that
occasion&mdash;unless it be Columbus before the
Dominicans, or Galileo before the inquisitors,

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

or Luther when he faced his judges at the
Diet of Worms."</p>

<p>"Diet of worms!" here interrupted Mrs.
Cash, who had been dozing. "Why, what a
filthy diet! I have heard tell of pounded snails
and milk, or woodlice taken fasting, but though
it may be right enough to keep up the <i>stammerer</i>,
the very thought of such intolerable
nastiness, as living upon worms, is enough to
turn my stomach."</p>

<p>When the laughter occasioned by this sally
had subsided, the Lady Floranthe added,</p>

<p>"You may find your female partisans (as I
just heard Lord Besom observe) sometimes
over-enthusiastic, but believe me seldom wanting
in acuteness. It will be midnight before
you gain intelligence of your enemies' tactics
for to-morrow, if even then your spies do not
deceive you. Now I can furnish you already
with their plan of action, decided in the
council which only broke up half an hour
before we met."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

<p>"Indeed!" said Sir Jasper, "what is their
<i>cheval de bataille</i> to-morrow&mdash;financial?"</p>

<p>"No, historical. They have ranged through
the annals of the united monarchies before
the union, and they pretend to have discovered
antecedents strictly analogic in the parliamentary
history of Great Britain.</p>

<p>"They quote the hypothesis of a certain
D'Israeli, a political poet of that day, and suppose
the great, good, ridiculous and infamous
characters of history to be reproduced at intervals.
He contended that Ulysses lived again
in the French King, Louis Philippe; and those
who make that quotation pretend to discover
in yourself, the Sir Robert Peel Redivivus, in
Lord Besom, the Brougham of an earlier
day."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Sir Jasper, "what was
their exact career? between the myriads of fictitious
memoirs, political and historic novels,
and allegoric fictions, we have, perforce, abandoned

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

the domain of history to professional historians."</p>

<p>"Though I have no pretension to historic
knowledge I can tell you," replied the Lady
Floranthe, "enlightened by the discussion, of
this day, as reported to me in its fullest details.
The famous Sir Robert was alternately the
zealous champion on <i>both sides</i> of <i>every great
question</i> during half a century. He opposed
every important measure of reform with colours
nailed to the mast, and cry of "no surrender,"
and passed them all but one&mdash;the reform of
1832. But this proved a wholesome warning,
and he never let a bill steal a march on him
again. He was the great opponent of Catholic
Emancipation&mdash;he carried Catholic Emancipation&mdash;he
opposed Reform&mdash;Reform slipped
through his fingers&mdash;he was the great protectionist
leader, he passed the Corn Laws,
damaging Lord John Russell and breaking
up the League. He opposed the repeal of
the Irish Union, and then killed O'Connell

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

by passing the Repeal Act&mdash;Chartism raised
its head&mdash;he took it up and died like the
great Chatham, on his legs in the house, passing
a magnificent panegyric upon Frost&mdash;to
whom he had just offered a seat in the cabinet.
His death relieved Feargus O'Connor from the
sick bed to which he had betaken himself, and
was fatal to D'Israeli the poet-politician I have
cited&mdash;for when Sir Robert died, he felt his
occupation gone, and never afterwards held up
his head. He had no more to do in life
than Shylock, in the Merchant of Venice,
with Antonio's character omitted. He was
buried in the same grave with the great
minister, like the Ichneumon in the entrails
of the crocodile; but his famous hypothesis
will revive him in the memory of posterity
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And what was the exact history of that
Lord Brougham to whom I am likened," said
Lord Besom.</p>

<p>"He was like you, Lord Chancellor&mdash;a dignity

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

to which he rose by the force of a reputation
acquired, through uncompromising boldness
in the people's cause and through the extent
and universality of his genius. He was seen
at the trial of Queen Caroline, pointing out
her royal husband through his disguise, amongst
the spectators, and addressing him as "go vile
traducer go!" Twenty years later, he had
taken to glosing over Princes. The ambition
of universality had destroyed him.
He had bearded royalty, and so turned
courtier for variety sake. In 1846 he had
replaced Lord George Bentinck on the turf&mdash;in
1847 he was master of the buckhounds&mdash;three
years later, he had retired to the East where he
became successively a Bonze, a Buddhist priest,
a Brahmin, and a dancing Dervish. In 1855 he
returned to Europe and Christianity, and took
up his residence at Rome, where he embraced
Catholicism, and died a cardinal, being
killed by the blow of an inkstand on the
temple at the last conclave in which physical

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

arguments were resorted to for the
election of a pope&mdash;the dignity to which
he was aspiring. His remains were interred
in the chapel of the country-house he had
built himself in the heart of the Biledulgerid,
and they say, my Lord Besom, that his spirit is
revived in you."</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">HISTORY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN 1906.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Middleman Cautious</span> was closeted in his
library with a middle aged individual, who had
partly entrenched himself with piles of loose
volumes, and held in his hand copious notes,
which he endeavoured somewhat tremulously
to unfold. The retired and studious habits of this
man&mdash;one of the most renowned historians of
his time&mdash;had rendered him a little nervous in
the presence of such a political celebrity as
the Moderate leader; but this feeling disappeared

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

as he proceeded and warmed into
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Then," said the historian, timorously and
with a sigh, "I have deceived myself in the flattering
hope I had conceived that so illustrious
an example might again have drawn the attention
of the public to history&mdash;that most noble,
most neglected of studies?"</p>

<p>"Utterly," replied Middleman Cautious,
"and pray divest yourself at once of the idea
that either now or through future, the pursuit
of history will ever again be entertained
by practical men, or indeed by any but those
whose sole attention it absorbs, whether as a
profession or a hobby."</p>

<p>"Time was, however," continued the bookworm,
"when the historian was reverenced as
the high priest of fame. If we take only
Hume and Robertson, and Gibbon, the editions
on those shelves are filled with their likenesses&mdash;the
shelves themselves are crowded with their
busts. The historian was great and honoured in

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

those days, because he had a public&mdash;he was
read. I had hoped to see those times revived."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Middleman Cautious;
"none but professional men and fools now
occupy themselves with history; and none
but men insane will eventually attempt to
do so. Time has no limits any more than
book-making; but the memory of man, like
his stomach, has. In former ages we had
scarce one book in a century, then ten, then a
hundred, and so on in geometrical progression.
Half a century back, by taking the average
between the one manuscript of an early age
and the ten thousand histories and memoirs of
a later century, it was still possible to form
some general notion of the history of four
thousand years. But it is quite clear that as
the number of books increases in this progression
it must become eventually impossible for
any human mind, or for the labour of a whole
existence to compass their contents. For all

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

who do not devote themselves exclusively to
the pursuit, that period is already arrived, and
an inundation of books already threatens to
be more destructive to knowledge than the
flames which devoured the Alexandrian library.</p>

<p>"To its extension it is obvious that a limit
must at some time come. I consider it, for
all practical purposes, come already. Wading
only ankle deep in the stream of history and
tradition, the historian might still reasonably
prosecute his research for truth amongst its
shallow waters, who would be carried out of
his depth when they had swollen into a river,
and irrecoverably lost when they had grown
into that ocean on which I for one have no
thought of adventuring. My motive for seeking
detailed information on the parliamentary
history of Great Britain, about the period of
those enactments, which led to the universal
extension of free-trade, is simply political.
With this partial exception, I have not at this
moment the remotest interest, nor any very

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

fixed belief in anything ever recorded beyond
the time that I can personally recall. The
fact is, that in the reputed apostacy of the
statesman who passed those measures a point
of offensive comparison may be instituted with
the actual premier. Historic quotation, applied
in the form of prophetic denunciation
by reference to the past, still tells amazingly;
and history is just in that happy
stage of confusion in which its facts, without
having become quite apocryphal, may yet
be twisted pretty well any how. Now all
the world recognise in yourself Mr. Grubout
Florid and in Niebuhr St. Thomas, the two
first biographers and historians of the age,
and, to speak frankly, I should have chosen
him, because so much less poetical, if
it had not been that unluckily he has just
edited some historic notes to prove the corn
law repeal to have been a mere allegory, and
that he regards Sir Robert Peel himself as a
wholly fictitious personage like the imaginary
John Doe and Richard Roe, introduced into

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

the law proceedings of that period. Let me
now have, as briefly as you can manage them,
the particulars you have gleaned on the
career of the chief political characters of that
era."</p>

<p>"You shall have them," replied Grubout
Florid, "though I pique myself more on
picturesqueness than on brevity&mdash;rather on
resuscitating the flowers from the dust of long
forgotten tomes than on being curtly erudite.
Let me, however, first sorrowfully admit my
concurrence in the melancholy view you take
of the historic art.</p>

<p>"Even I, who have spent half a life in my
researches, feel sometimes overwhelmed with
utter doubt as to the reality of the most
prominent characters and events. Let us
take for instance Napoleon Buonaparte, who
played so great a part, and whose name is the
only name besides that of Abraham, Solomon,
Alexander the Great, Mahomet, and Doctor
Morrison, at this day remembered in the East.

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

Here are four of the most esteemed authentic
works referring to his life or to the war
in the peninsular so fatal to his power:&mdash;Napier's
History of the Peninsular War, the
Duke of Wellington's Despatches, the History
of the Consulate and the Empire, by Thiers,
and the Fall of Napoleon, by Colonel Mitchell.</p>

<p>"Napier's history is an epic dramatically conceived,
and filled with the most artistic pictures.
I do not know whether it is not
superior to the Iliad; but it is framed in the
same spirit. The English are the Greeks&mdash;the
Duke of Wellington is his Achilles. To give
an adequate idea of their greatness, he
paints his imperial adversary, with his armies
and his marshals, as the Hector and the heroic
Trojans of his poem, depicting them as demigods,
to fill our minds with stupendous
admiration for the men who triumphed over
them.</p>

<p>"Every French leader is painted as a mixture
of the hero and the intellectual Titan; and

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

this done, the reader is left to draw his own
conclusions as to what "manner of men," his
vanquishers must have been.</p>

<p>"More artful than Homer, he never shortens
by one inch, the stature of those adversaries
whom he has made the standard by which the
greatness of their conquerors is judged&mdash;he
never tarnishes the fame of either by the admission
of any sort of error or misconduct&mdash;and
yet cannot be charged with the omission
of a due seasoning of dispraise and blame
throughout his epic&mdash;but then he saddles it all
on the shoulders of a third party&mdash;the Spanish
people.</p>

<p>"Napier's history of the peninsular war, would
have done credit to the golden age of Roman
Literature, if it were not wanting (as we find
by reference to the Wellington's despatches)
in two little requisites&mdash;impartiality and
truth.</p>

<p>"We are favoured for instance, with a bird's eye
view of the military plans of French generals

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

so intricately devised that we are struck
with wonder, that such cunning and farsighted
combinations could ever have been
foiled.</p>

<p>"We turn for confirmation to the Duke's Despatches&mdash;and
alas! discover, perhaps from the
intercepted letters of the adverse chief in question,
that he was fairly at his wit's end, and learn
from the contemporaneous avowal of the puzzled
hero that he had no distinct notion of his position,
beyond the consciousness of being in a
desperate pickle.</p>

<p>"The tenor of Napier is to show the wisdom
of the serpent, and the lion's daring baffled.</p>

<p>"The tenor of the Duke's Despatches, on the
contrary, rather indicates unerring advantage
taken of an enemy's mistakes and rashness.</p>

<p>"If we now turn to Theirs' History of the Consulate
and the Empire; this republican writer
in panegyrising the despotic emperor, depicts
him not only as of genius super-human; but

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

god-like in exemption from failing and from
error.</p>

<p>"All the great and good characters of history,
amalgamated into one would fall far short of
Thiers' Napoleon.</p>

<p>"Colonel Mitchell, on the contrary, has written
a book which quite as clearly proves him to
have been the most base, wicked, cowardly,
and blundering of all human beings; and whilst
Thiers exalts his statue till his laurelled head
is lost amid the clouds&mdash;the gallant Colonel so
reduces his importance, that he might be hidden
under a quart pot.</p>

<p>"The truth it will be said, lies between the
two extremities&mdash;a pretty consolation for the
historian, when these are so wide apart that
he might as well search for a pebble with the
direction, that it lay between the North Pole
and the Equator.</p>

<p>"That age has bequeathed to us flowery descriptions,
medals and pictures of great actions,
such as the crew of the Vengeur refusing to

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

surrender, and going to the bottom with cries
of <i>vive la republique!</i> or of Cambronne on his
knee with a flag in one hand and a sword in
the other, exclaiming, "<i>La garde meurt mais
ne se rend pas</i>," yet elsewhere we find some
old admiral disturbed in his retirement, who
declares with name, date, and particulars, that
he captured and carried into port that very
heroic crew, and Cambronne in person, who
did surrender, lived to deny the words attributed
to him.</p>

<p>"What therefore are we to believe in history,
whilst any part of it remains unexplored? and
what arguments do not its discrepancies
afford to the scepticism of such men as Niebuhr
St. Thomas!"</p>

<p>"What indeed," replied Middleman Cautious,
"but after this dissertation on history
in general, which is pre-eminently uninteresting
to me, perhaps you will descend to those
particulars in which just now I <i>am</i> interested."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied the historian, "but
I must be allowed to treat the subject my
own way. If you mean that I am rather picturesquely,
and philosophically discursive, than
critically brief, I plead guilty to the charge."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the politician.</p>

<p>"To proceed, I was observing then, what can
we believe in history if we leave any of its
records unexplored&mdash;and what labour to explore
them! Look at these piles of pamphlets,
books, and papers! These are not the tithe
of those I have resorted to in the compilation
of my notes, and yet how great their number
and variety. Here are parliamentary reports,
collections of leading articles, to say nothing
of pure histories, and fictions, and all the piebald
brood issuing in desolating bastardy from
such unnatural intermixture&mdash;the historic fiction,
the political novel, the politico-historic-fiction,
the historico-politico-fictive novel.
Biographies of Nobody-cares-who, by Nobody-knows-whom.
Imaginary conversations,
fictitious debates, and memoirs founded only in

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

the inventive faculties of the writers. Here
is 'The life of Smith by Green,' 'Thomson's
Biography of Styles,' and 'Recollections of
Brown by Wiggins.' See, this is labelled
'Green upon Smith,' and the Editor gives
unanswerable reasons why you should read it.</p>

<p>" 'Perhaps,' he says, 'reader, the works of
Green may be unknown to you; you may
never even have heard of Smith. But is it
possible to adduce a stronger reason than that
very fact affords why you should peruse these
volumes in search of that information of
which you are confessedly so ignorant.'</p>

<p>"Here we have 'The appropriation clause
considered,' by Alderman Gibbs; 'Diffidence,'
an essay, by Mr. Sheriff Moon;
'Every man his own trumpeter,' by Sir
Peter Laurie; 'Statistics of the Russian Empire,'
by M. P. Miles; 'an enquiry into the
character and opinions of the one individual
who voted for Mr. Alderman Moon;' 'The
Municipal Institutions of London in 1846, or
speculative enquiry whether the Aldermen of

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

that city were allowed to vote for themselves
in the election of Lord Mayor;' 'The life of
Colonel Sibthorpe,' in ten volumes; 'The
three repeals; Repeal of Catholic disabilities,
Repeal of the Corn Law, and
Repeal of the Union,' or, 'All the best
speeches on both sides of the question,
for young members,' by Sir Robert Peel,
Baronet, 1860; 'On the strength of materials,'
by Doctor Reid, comprising wood, iron,
stone, caoutchouc, gutta-percha, and the patience
of the House of Commons&mdash;on which
he was led to try a long series of experiments,
by accidentally witnessing the trials to which
it was successfully subjected during the debates.
Here is 'Every eye shall see him, or
the visit of Prince Albert to Liverpool,' used
in illustration of 'The second coming of
Christ,' by the Reverend Hugh MacNeil,
Canon of Chester; 'Hatchard and Sons,'
'The National Debt, how to wipe it out,'
chiefly compiled from the early writings and
speeches of Sir James Graham. Also (bound

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

uniformly with 'Schlegel's History of Literature,'
and 'D'Israeli's Curiosities of Literature,')
the 'History of Letters, their
origin, development, and tendency, or whence
they come, their contents, and destination,'
by Sir James Graham. Here is 'No Surrender,'
a letter addressed to the electors of
Tamworth, bound up with 'The charter familiarly
explained,' by Sir Robert Peel.</p>

<p>" 'Medi&aelig;val cookery,' or 'the art of roasting
a goose alive,' together with 'The Economy of
Retribution,' or, 'The whole art of satisfying
one's vindictiveness,' by Benjamin D’Israeli;
'Loredano, the Venetian, or how to bottle up
revenge and keep it close,' by Lord George
Bentinck.</p>
<p>" 'Pastoral duties, or the price of a donkey
ride,' by Lord Ripon.</p>

<p>" 'The Brahminical Dispensation,' by Lord
Brougham; also 'the Jolly Huntsman,' 'a
collection of sporting songs,' and 'some years
later,' by Cardinal Brougham; 'The Lives of
the Fathers' and 'Indulgences vindicated.'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

<p>"Here are two hundred volumes of Revelations.
First, the Apocrypha, explained by
Peter Borthwick, M.P. Next we have 'Revelations
of Paris,' 'Revelations of London,'
'Revelations of Austria,' 'Revelations of the
Turf,' by Lord George Bentinck, 'Revelations
of Spain,' 'Revelations of the Eel-pie-house,'
'Back-stair revelations,' 'Revelations of St.
Mary-le-bone,' 'Revelations of St. Pancras,'
and 'Revelations of all the most public events
which have occurred during the last half
century.' Who would believe that a writer
would be found after all these to style his
book 'Revelations of Russia?' "</p>

<p>"Might I take the liberty to suggest,"
said Middleman Cautious, "that it is rather
your compilation from these materials, than a
catalogue or synopsis of your library, that I
want."</p>

<p>"True, I was forgetful. I will at once
communicate the result of my labours," replied
Grubout Florid, who, referring to his notes,
continued in a tone somewhat declamatory.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

<p>"After long research into the literature
contemporaneous with, or authentically referring
to, that period of British history in which
Sir Robert Peel is said&mdash;through repeal of the
corn laws&mdash;to have given a decisive impulse to
that great principle of free-trade which eventually
changed the political aspect of the
world&mdash;after wading through its ocean-like
immensity, and diving deep into its contradictory
perplexities, I find that about the epoch
referred to, the most prominent public characters
were Daniel O'Connell, Morrison, the
Hygeist, Sir Robert Peel, Abd-el-Kader,
Professor Holloway, O'Brien Smith, Colonel
Sibthorpe, and the Earl of Aldborough. At
least during the period in question we find
these names most frequently before the public,
and we may hence deduce that, whatever their
individual merits, they chiefly filled the thoughts
of their contemporaries, and were invested in
their eyes, with a degree of interest which we
have now some difficulty in comprehending."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE EARL OF ALDBOROUGH. COLONEL SIBTHORPE.
O'CONNELL.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">On</span> all these remarkable personages I have
gathered and abstracted such particulars as my
previous biographic studies and the immediate
investigation of the subject could afford; but to
give you some faint idea of the difficulties of
such a task I will follow the example of the
nobleman to whom I have alluded, widely famed
in his day, and become proverbial in the next
generation. It is worthy of remark that an
individual reputation&mdash;thanks to the tendency
of the human mind to allegorise&mdash;frequently
survives all correct tradition of the acts or
circumstances which have given it currency
with posterity. Bacchus and Hercules no

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

doubt were military or political chiefs of that
stamp from which heroes have been framed in
all ages; and their names have been handed
down as gods indeed, but the one seated on a
barrel as an incurable sot; the other, reeking
from the Augean stables, as an indefatigable
scavenger.</p>

<p>"Jason and the Argonauts&mdash;the intelligent
and enterprising navigators of their day, who
if they had lived in 1846 might have fitted out a
vessel in search of guano&mdash;were represented
by posterity as men who in their most successful
attempt&mdash;the capture of the golden
fleece&mdash;were merely wool gathering. In like
manner I find the Earl of Aldborough proverbially
and contradictorily cited during
twenty years as the Job of the nineteenth
century, and as at once the most consciously
obliged and ungrateful of men.</p>

<p>"His history&mdash;as it may be gathered from the
periodicals of the day, in which his name is as
closely allied to that of Professor Holloway as
the names of Castor and Pollux in the Greek

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

mythology or the astronomic system&mdash;affords
a colour to all these suppositions.</p>

<p>"This much afflicted nobleman&mdash;as perusal of
the following document will demonstrate, might
aptly have replaced the scriptural Job; and
I have before me a tract, published in 1847,
by a Canon of Chester, author of 'Every
eye shall see him, or the Second Coming
of Christ, illustrated by the visit of Prince
Albert to Liverpool,' in which that reverend
divine dwells upon the cure effected by
Professor Holloway, and moots the question
'whether Providence in its inscrutable beneficence
brought a Holloway into the world to
soothe the afflictions of an Aldborough, or
whether the Earl of Aldborough was saddled
with these afflictions to illustrate the merits of
a Holloway?'</p>

<p>"The document referred to is an extract from
the corner of a county paper in the year 1860
headed&mdash;Popular Saws. 'It is common to
hear,' says the country Editor, ' "If I had the

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

patience of an Aldborough," "You are as
thankless as any Aldborough," "I am as
grateful as an Aldborough," &amp;c.'</p>

<p>"The key to these popular expressions may be
found in a communication made fifteen years
ago to the press by the celebrated professor
Holloway, and which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Extract of a letter from the Earl of Aldborough,
dated Villa Messina, Leghorn,
21st of February, 1845.</p>

<p>" '<span class="smcap">To Professor Holloway</span>,</p>

<p>" '<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>" 'Various circumstances prevented
the possibility of my thanking you
before this time for your politeness in sending
me your pills as you did; I now take this opportunity
of sending you an order for the
amount, and at the same time to add that your
pills have cured me of the complicated indisposition
from which I was suffering, consisting
of gout, ague, jaundice, tic douloureux, asthma,
colic, debility, blotches on the skin, constipation,

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

erysipelas, lumbago, scrofula, weakness,
sore throat, headache, indigestion, dropsy,
worms, tumours, liver complaint, and fits,
which all the most eminent of the faculty at
home and all over the Continent had not been
able to effect; nay! not even the waters of
Carlsbad and Marienbad. I wish to have another
box, and a pot of ointment, in case my
family should be afflicted with the little
ailments from which your pills have relieved
me,</p>

<p class="right">" 'Your most obliged and obedient Servant<br/>

"(Signed) 'ALDBOROUGH.'</p>

<p>"It is obvious from the above admission that
the Earl had the opportunity of exhibiting an
unparalleled fortitude&mdash;it is equally clear that
no man could ever be more obliged to
another than he to the professor who cured
him; and it is equally plain that he must have
been the most ungrateful of men if he were
not.</p>

<p>"Now on the one hand the payment for one
box of pills, and the quid pro quo exacted in

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

the shape of a fresh supply, appears but a niggardly
reward; yet, on the other, this public
acknowledgment of the benefit conferred will
hardly warrant such a supposition, and the
Earl may have simply refrained through delicacy
from naming the fact, that he had in the
effusion of his gratitude taken the coronet, (the
peculiar head-gear of the British aristocracy
half a century since) from his own head to place
it on that of the professor&mdash;which indeed in
the opinion of many would be the least he
could have done."</p>

<p>"But what political connexion," asked Middleman
Cautious, "had the Earl of Aldborough
and Professor Holloway with Sir Robert
Peel?"</p>

<p>"None, except that of sharing with him,
the distinction of being great public characters
in their day; and, as regards Professor Holloway,
of being sanctioned by him, since we
learn from the same authority that a government
authentication was stamped on all the

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

Professor's medicines during the period in
which Sir Robert presided over that government.
Though however they were only public
and not political characters I have cited them
to illustrate the plausibility with which the
most contradictory notions may be disseminated
by contemporaries, and imbibed by posterity."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to interrupt you," said Middleman
Cautious, "but suppose we confine
our view exclusively to the political characters
of the epoch."</p>

<p>"It was my intention," replied the historian.
"First in my notes I have Colonel Sibthorpe.
He was much celebrated both in that and in
previous parliaments. The ten volumes of his
life which I have before me are written with
a modesty which would have been more becoming
to that great man personally than to his
biographer. They do not, though somewhat
prolix, acquaint us with any of the chief facts
of a life which doubtless was eventful, and it
can only be gathered from them, that during a

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

consistent parliamentary career he opposed
every measure, good, bad or indifferent, until
the last three sessions preceding his decease,
in which he proposed successively&mdash;the re-imposition
of Catholic disabilities&mdash;the restoration
of the rotten boroughs&mdash;the re-establishment
of slavery into the British Colonies&mdash;the
re-introduction of the twelve-hundred-lash
system in the army, and the abolition of
free trade in corn. He failed in all these undertakings,
though he had the benefit of all
the light thrown at various times on his own
view of all these questions by the great Sir
Robert. Such successive disappointments probably
were fatal to the gallant Colonel, whose
decease was so sudden as to cause a Coroner's
jury to be empanelled by a certain Wakely,
which returned as its verdict,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">'Died from too large a development of the
cerebral organs, but whether from excess
of the reflective or perceptive powers,
there is no evidence to show.'</p>

</blockquote>

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

<p>Beyond these particulars it is to be lamented
that his biographer has left us but meagre and
often negative materials. We are enabled to
gather that he is reported to have been present,
(or at least actually in London), at the
period of the Coronation of Queen Victoria,
but great doubts exist as to his having visited
the fair held in Hyde Park on that occasion;
and it is confidently asserted that he did not
witness the roasting of the ox upon the Thames
during the winter of 18&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. It is further
assured that he never employed Mr. Eisenberg
to cut his corns, and that he had no share in
the design of the fountains in Trafalgar Square,
though this last assumption does not bear the
same <i>prima facie</i> evidence of probability as the
preceding. It must however be admitted that
these facts, though full of interest for the arch&aelig;ologist,
have little for a general public.</p>

<p>"The modern Biographer, seeking therefore
to accord his task with the spirit of his era, is

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

obliged to turn from the conjecture of unrecorded
events to dwell upon the characteristics
fortunately more distinct of so interesting an
existence.</p>

<p>"Our hero appears to have united in his
person&mdash;to the excellences of the soldier, poet
and statesman&mdash;the pious zeal befitting a
churchman, militant, and the graces of a leader
of the fashion of his time.</p>

<p>"We always find him spoken of as the <i>gallant</i>
Colonel, even in a senate in which the conqueror
of Napoleon had once sat, and in which
the victor of the Sikhs had still a seat.
Though therefore no authentic account remains
of the part he played at Waterloo,
there can be little doubt that he (Colonel Sibthorpe)
must eminently have distinguished himself
there or <i>elsewhere</i>.</p>

<p>"In the midst of a fervid flow of eloquence
when resisting the removal of Catholic disabilities
at the time of the Emancipation Bill,

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

he is recorded to have exclaimed enthusiastically&mdash;as
may be seen by reference to the parliamentary
reports of that time&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">'Whilst I can handle stick or stone<br/>

I will defend the Church and throne."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Now, besides proving him to be a poet, we
may perhaps, be warranted in deducing from
this distich, that his valour was of a primitive
and Homeric kind, and it might not have been
deemed ungracious in the crown or church to
have rewarded his memory by a statue; whether
in the court-yard of Windsor Castle, or
opposite Lambeth Palace, representing their
joint champion with a club in one hand, and a
brick bat in the other.</p>

<p>"It is not meant to be contended that the
lines above cited, attain poetic sublimity though
breathing energetic resolution.</p>

<p>"But it must be remembered, that there are

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

two kinds of poets, those who only move posterity,
and others who make the very heartstrings
of the living generation vibrate. Sibthorpe
seemed to have been of these, and
the extent to which he was appreciated by his
countrymen, is obvious, from the fact, that he
was returned member for Lincoln, in opposition
to Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer, by the
very parliament which repealed the Corn
Laws.</p>

<p>"Of his character as a leader of fashion, we
have some means of judging through the testimony
furnished by Mr. Thomas Duncombe,
Member for Finsbury, who was forced to admit&mdash;though
a political opponent, and under circumstances
of some provocation&mdash;that few of his
constituents were such well-dressed men as
Colonel Sibthorpe. We have hence, evidence that
he was a well-dressed man, and learn from other
quarters, that his appearance was remarkable.
Now these characteristics would so well agree

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

with those of D'Orsay&mdash;cited so often at that
period, that we cannot but suspect these personages
to have been identical.</p>

<p>"In fact, by the alteration of a few letters,
Sibthorpe and D'Orsay are the same. Transpose
the <i>s</i> of Sibthorpe beyond the seventh letter,
strike out the <i>ibt</i>, change the <i>h</i> to a <i>d</i>,
and alter the final <i>p</i> to an <i>ay</i>, and you
will find that these names are literally the
same.</p>

<p>"Sibthorpe was, therefore, D'Orsay, and
D'Orsay Sibthorpe, the beau of his age&mdash;the
witty, the elegant, the incomparable.</p>

<p>"Chateaubriand, or Walter Scott, or Victor
Hugo, who imbue their descriptions so thoroughly
with the spirit of the time, would have
given, in a few lines, a masterly picture, no
doubt, of this accomplished worthy, to the portraiture
of whom my scanty materials only
enable me to add his costume, which we know
to have been irreproachable&mdash;his clothes by

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

Moses,* his linen got up by Mesdames Gilbert
and Hitchcock, and his brows adorned by one of
Professor Brown's patent ventilating, invisible
toup&eacute;es.</p>

<p>Moses of the Minories, from his palace of fashion,

<p>It is somewhere related, that on a certain occasion,
Ibrahim's father, Mehemet Ali, called the
chief Rabbi of the Alexandrian Jews before him. He
had beside him a copy of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>"That is a wonderful book," said the Pacha.</p>

<p>"A most holy book," said the Rabbi.</p>

<p>"Can you assure me that it is all true?" asked Mehemet,
meditatively.</p>

<p>"Every syllable," replied the Rabbi, delighted at
the impression he had made.</p>

<p>"Then it is a fact that the Jews were once in the
land of Egypt?"</p>

<p>"Most true."</p>

<p>"And you are their direct descendants?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"Then," continued the Pacha, "I find by this
book, that before they took their departure, they

plate and ornaments, but I cannot anywhere discover
that they ever <i>returned them</i>. You will be
so good as inform your co-religionaries, that I expect
they will do so into my hands, or contribute
an equivalent."</p>

<p>"I now come to O'Connell, the political leviathan
of his day&mdash;alternately styled the Liberator,
the Great King Dan, or the Big Beggarman,
by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>"At all events, all seem agreed that there was

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

nothing little about him&mdash;even his meanness.</p>

<p>"He is usually represented with a comically
shaped tile upon his head&mdash;a sort of fanciful hat
of Mercury without its wings&mdash;which it is supposed
he started in opposition to Prince Albert.
His figure is colossal and burly&mdash;he has a
merry cock of the eye, and in his hand he
holds a begging-box.</p>

<p>"There are, however, writers who have been
unable exactly to discern anything more degrading
in accepting the voluntary thousands
of a people who believed it due, for service
rendered, than in the salary of a minister or
official, whom the contributing masses would
often pay to get rid of; and some have even
judged it quite as honourable as the provision
made for princes, or the pensions of
diplomatists who have been chiefly employed in
allowing their cabinets to be outwitted. But
it is impossible to speak of O'Connell without
giving a few words to Ireland.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

<p>"During centuries that country had been fearfully
misgoverned. Kings, favourites, puritans and
parliaments, in turn, reduced oppression to a
systematic art, on which they rung all imaginable
changes, from open massacre, to Machiavelian
cruelty.</p>

<p>"They were Englishmen, with all the energy
and foresight distinguishing them in evil as in
good; and which has given as great a pre-eminence
to British pickpockets, burglars and
buccaneers, in skill, hardihood and brutality
as to British soldiers, sailors, statesmen, artisans
and merchants in their vocations.</p>

<p>"There was therefore, probably, never in the
history of the world, any oppression so varied
in its forms, so consistent and so long enduring,
as that, which during hundreds of years, the
rulers of Great Britain inflicted on the
population of Ireland. At least, if the
social persecution of the Pariahs, by superior
castes, exceeded that of the Irish people&mdash;the

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

long oppression of the Jews in Europe was
only second to it.</p>

<p>"When all these systems had been successively
exhausted, the hardy Irish population
had not been exterminated, like the early inhabitants
of the West Indian Islands, and of the
North American forests and prairies&mdash;but they
were so reduced in numbers, and so far
swamped by the oppressing race, that any alleviation
of their misery through their own
efforts, became hopeless.</p>

<p>"Towards the close of the eighteenth century,
the dominant Anglo-Irish Protestant race,
equalled the native Roman Catholics in numbers,
and were possessed of wealth, arms, power,
education and advantages, which nothing but
an enormous numerical superiority on the part
of the oppressed could have counter-balanced.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances, the genius of
Erin, with her harp under her arm, her long

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

locks tied up with a green ribbon and a
shamrock on her bosom, took her flight despairingly
across the wide Atlantic.</p>

<p>"She dived downwards towards the earth,&mdash;not
to catch, as they fell, the gems into
which her bright tears hardened&mdash;but to pick
up on the shores of the new world&mdash;the potatoe.</p>

<p>"Some say she had long since stolen it, together
with a quid, from the pocket of Sir Walter
Raleigh; and stored it up against a rainy
day; but be this as it may, she made the
esculent root the means of Ireland's regeneration.</p>

<p>" 'With the smile on her lips, and the tear in
her eye,' she dropped it as the symbol of freedom
on her Emerald shore, and from that unsightly
bulb, there sprang stalk, leaf and flower,
and finally&mdash;through the wonderful increase
of population to which its cultivation led&mdash;aboriginal
emancipation.</p>

<p>"Half a century afterwards, the native
Catholics instead of constituting only half the

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

population, outnumbered the Protestant colonists
by more than six millions to less than
two&mdash;and consequently, by this period, all the
civil and political grievances of Ireland had been
redressed, and there remained nothing but their
deep traces to obliterate.</p>

<p>"The weeping spirit of Erin&mdash;for though then
in comfortable circumstances she had grown
watery-eyed through long habit&mdash;the weeping
spirit of Erin then withdrew her gift.</p>

<p>"The potatoe had fulfilled its providential
mission. By multiplying little Pats, it had
brought John Bull to reason, and this feat
once accomplished, she withdrew it lest
her green island should have been devoured
through preposterous increase, by its swarming
children. The potatoe disappeared for ever
from the Irish soil, to be subsequently reverenced
by future generations, like the onion by
the Egyptians&mdash;and to replace the old Shamrock
as symbolical of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Should we therefore wonder that to the character

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

and person of her most favoured son&mdash;the
hero of that important epoch&mdash;she should have
given a physical and historical resemblance to
her favourite root?</p>

<p>"O'Connell, or the great King Dan, a mightier
potentate than even King Hudson, and who
did better service in his day, than any score of
monarchs&mdash;Daniel O'Connell could not, as far
as physiognomy went, have been so aptly
likened, to anything created, as to the potatoe.</p>

<p>"His political history too, bore a striking analogy
to the history of that esculent. He appeared
upon the scene when the foot of the
Saxon was really upon the necks of his countrymen.
With the power and energy of a Titan&mdash;with
a genius alike destructive and administrative&mdash;with
an eloquence never equalled since
the time of Peter the Hermit, (if we are to judge
of eloquence by its result in persuading)&mdash;O'Connell
battled successfully for Ireland's
emancipation&mdash;and he is, undoubtedly, entitled

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

to share with the potatoe the chief glory of
being his country's Liberator, even if we
accord some little part to the tardily awakened
sense of justice in the British
people.</p>

<p>"But when the potatoe had given Ireland
numbers, and that numbers had given an importance
to her wrongs which led to their redress;
the pauper-breeding, famine-generating
potatoe, instead of a blessing became a curse,
which Providence happily banished.</p>

<p>"So, the Repeal threatened by O'Connell,
as the alternative of refusal to redress the
grievances of Erin, and his fierce denunciations
of Saxon oppression&mdash;once so useful&mdash;became
noxious to her interests when the Saxon
foot was only, in his figures of speech, upon the
neck of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Repeal in 1845-6 meant that Ireland,
which remorselessly oppressed for ages, had
never risen simultaneously against Great Britain,
was to cut herself adrift at the very

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

moment that the English people&mdash;having come
to a sense of its past injustice&mdash;had righted
all her wrongs, and for the first time felt inclined
to efface, as speedily as possible, their
deeply furrowed traces.</p>

<p>"O'Connell with his repeal, in fact, was like
the old man in the fable, who set his idle sons
to dig for an imaginary treasure, in the pursuit
of which they secured real wealth by fitting
the soil for agricultural purposes&mdash;but with
this addition to the fable, that not daring to avow
the suppositious nature of the treasure, he had
been doomed to see these ardent explorers, in
the prosecution of their researches, turn up
again the crop-covered surface of the very
fields they had fertilised in the course of previous
investigation.</p>

<p>"The nation however was in this sense to
blame, that instead of subscribing a given sum
as a reward for his past exertions&mdash;as in the
example of the tens of thousands collected by

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

the league for Cobden it allowed him nothing
but his salary or rent for present services.</p>

<p>"The shrewd British manufacturers paid for
their work by the piece; the Irish people gave
a time task.</p>

<p>" 'So much in a lump for redress of the
Corn-law grievance, no cure no pay,' said the
Manchester and Birmingham men.</p>

<p>" 'An annual salary as long as you choose
to physic us,' said the Irish.</p>

<p>"After looming in the eyes of Europe as a
political giant; after meriting the success
which he commanded; and after having relinquished
the fortune which his energy and
talents must have secured, he found himself in
this position, that unless willing to share the
fate of a Belisarius, he was forced to derogate
from his towering eminence, and from the
<span class="smcap">Hero</span> to become&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Humbug</span>.</p>

<p>"The melancholy end of this once great man
was occasioned, as it is well known, by the political
plagiarism of the keen Sir Robert.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

<p>"When Sir Robert disarmed him of his
repeal threat by passing repeal into a law,
O'Connell's strength of mind abandoned him,
and his last words were long remembered by
the grateful country he had served so well and
humbugged so gloriously.</p>

<p>" '<i>Pale! Pale!</i>' said the dying patriot, reproachfully,
'you have been the death of
me! you have taken the very bread out of
my mouth, and out of the mouths of my
childer.'</p>

<p>"So saying, he expired, leaving none to
follow worthy of being afterwards embalmed
in Ireland's memory like him, with its Ossianic
heroes, its Fingals, and its Oscars, the extinct
giants of its traditionary annals, as the antediluvian
mastodon and mammoth of its zoologic
history."</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">HISTORY IN 1906.&mdash;SIR ROBERT PEEL.&mdash;CIVILISED
STATES IN 1846.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I now</span> come to Sir Robert Peel," said Grubout
Florid.</p>

<p>"Sir Robert Peel may be distinctly judged
according to different standards.</p>

<p>"If we regard the importance of the part he
played in his generation, he was a great and
successful man. Peel, O'Connell, and Louis
Philippe, were the three characters of their
era, who, personally, most influenced the condition

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

of the civilised world; as Napoleon, Pitt,
and Wellington, had done in an age preceding
them.</p>

<p>"If we are to judge him by the result of his
actions on posterity, he is greater still, because,
with his name is associated the recognition
of the principle of Free Trade, a measure
more important to the destiny of humanity,
than either the gothic inroad of the crusades,
or the French Revolution.</p>

<p>"Peel&mdash;like Pitt and O'Connell&mdash;looming
dimly through the mist of history, will be remembered
when Fox, Sheridan, Canning, and
Lord Grey have been forgotten.</p>

<p>"But if measured by his individual merits, he
falls far short of this standard, and seems
only to have been the political Augustus of
his epoch&mdash;the Octavius C&aelig;sar, who wore, successfully,
the mighty diadem which Julius
died for having coveted&mdash;to whom his
star decreed, that which had not been vouchsafed
to Pompey's conqueror, and before

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

whose fortune, the righteous cause of Brutus
and Mark Anthony's fiery valor alike succumbed.</p>

<p>"Augustus C&aelig;sar&mdash;hidden in his tent when
Anthony vanquished Brutus&mdash;reigned peacefully
over the vast realms which others had
won; and transmitted to posterity a name
more widely bruited, as the first and greatest of
a long line of Roman Emperors.</p>

<p>"Sir Robert Peel strenuously opposed that
Catholic Emancipation, which Pitt, in the
midst of his tremendous struggle with England's
mortal enemy, sighed to leave unachieved&mdash;which
Canning looked to as the
key-stone of his glory, and as the promised
land, upon whose threshold he was doomed to
die. Yet, where the far-sighted liberality of the
one&mdash;the eloquence and generous enthusiasm
of the other, had failed, it was given to Sir
Robert&mdash;fresh from the ranks of toleration's
enemies&mdash;to triumph!</p>

<p>"Sir Robert Peel, after opposing every liberal

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

measure during a quarter of a century,
passed every liberal measure but one, so that
when he expired introducing his famous bill to
make the Charter the law of England, this
Augustan epitaph was inscribed upon his tomb
by the Chartist-poet, Ernest Jones,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">'Would, for the cause of progress, that he had
never been born or never died!'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Now, in which of these characters do you
wish to set him forth, as the Octavius sick at
Philippi, and profiting by the victory of another,
or as the diademed Augustus, whose proverbial
fortune, mankind had learned to bless
in its beneficial results upon their destiny?"</p>

<p>"I want," replied Middleman Cautious, "to
pick a hole in his coat. If he were good, great,
and irreproachable, I would not disturb his
memory just now."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

<p>"In that case, I will pass over the useful reforms
he effected in the criminal and civil
jurisprudence of his country, and in fact,
wherever reform could be effected without
sacrificing any interest or entailing any opposition,
for he was never illiberal or arbitrary
without a reason, and herein differed from
some of his colleagues, and especially from a
certain Sir James Graham.</p>

<p>"The earliest period to which my notes refer
is about 1815. In or about this year, in the
parliament then assembled, Sir Robert was
instrumental in the imposition of those Corn
Laws which he obtained so much power by
supporting during thirty years, and so much
credit for repealing. In the same House of
Commons he declared with regard to the Catholic
Claims&mdash;'That he saw no prospect of
a final and satisfactory adjustment of them.'</p>

<p>"In 1817, he was elected Member for the
University of Oxford as the recognised champion
of the opponents of Emancipation.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

<p>"In 1821 we find him again the thrice elected
member of the university, opposing Canning
on Mr. Plunkett's motion in favour of that
question.</p>

<p>"In 1822, on the occasion of Canning's motion
to allow Roman Catholic Peers to sit in
the House of Lords, we find him pointing out,
with horror to the Commons, the consequences
of this measure, which would inevitably
be, he dared prognosticate, 'to give Roman
Catholics a seat in that very House!!!'</p>

<p>"In 1825, we discover him active in support
of the bill to dissolve the Roman Catholic
Association.</p>

<p>"In 1827 he said 'That all the reason, which
had been given for concession increased his
dislike to it. He preferred a system of <i>exclusion</i>
to <i>any securities</i>, and fairly confessed
that he had a <i>mistrust</i> of Roman Catholics,
and had a right to look to what the effect of
their tenets had been in other countries. He
believed that to admit Roman Catholics within

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

the walls of Parliament would be dangerous
to the constitution, and that its only effect in
Ireland would be to increase discord and dissension.</p>

<p>"That at this time Sir Robert was considered
as a rock and sheet anchor of immutability
and consistency, may be gathered from this
little parliamentary episode, which I have
transcribed in my notes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brougham (afterwards Lord Chancellor
and eventually his Eminence Cardinal
Brougham) was on the occasion in question
very complimentary to Sir Robert at the expense
of Canning.</p>

<p>" 'If,' said Mr. Brougham, according to
the parliamentary reports, 'if the other ministers
had taken example by the <i>single-hearted,
plain, manly, and upright</i> conduct of
the Right Honourable Secretary for the Home
Department (Sir Robert Peel) who had always
been on the same side of the question,
never swerving from his opinion, but standing

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

uniformly up and stating it&mdash;whose
mouth, heart, and conduct had always been
in unison upon the question; if such had
been the conduct of all the friends of Emancipation
he should not have found himself in
a state almost bordering upon despair with
regard to the Catholic Claims.' And then
turning to Canning, he apostrophised him as
one who, acting in contradiction to his avowed
sentiments on this question&mdash;'had exhibited a
specimen&mdash;a most incredible specimen&mdash;of the
most monstrous truckling for the purpose of
obtaining office, that the whole history of political
tergiversation could furnish.'</p>

<p>"The sequel proved that there was more
warmth and energy than foresight both in the
praise and denunciation of Mr. Brougham,
who, in lauding the immutable consistency of
Sir Robert&mdash;in avowing his despair of Catholic
Emancipation, and in holding up Canning
as a shuffler on that point, fell into three

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

errors as great as the circumstances would
admit of.</p>

<p>"Canning did attempt to pass the Emancipation,
and died in the attempt. Emancipation
did pass, though Mr. Brougham despaired of
it, and it was passed by Sir Robert, whom he
had cited as a model of consistency for upholding
it."</p>

<p>"Did Brougham laud his consistency <i>afterwards?</i>"
asked Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>"I cannot exactly call to mind," replied
the historian, "but this I remember, that
even at the close of Sir Robert's career he
might conscientiously have done so. Every
quality which can by any possibility be adjectively
united to a thing or person is essentially
comparative in its nature. A Brobdingnag
dwarf would have been tall beside a Lilliputian
giant, and <i>vice versa</i>, and Brougham,
might, with perfect truth, have defined Sir Robert,
if contrasted with himself, as a consistent

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

politician, even when after having passed the
three Repeals, he had become the champion
of the Charter.</p>

<p>"On the occasion in question it is recorded,
however, that Mr. Brougham's adversary gave
him a not very indirect hint that his notions,
or at least assertions, were inaccurate; for,
according to the reports, Mr. Secretary Canning
answered&mdash;'I rise to say that that is
false!'</p>

<p>"When Canning at length determined to
pass the measure, Sir Robert seceded from his
Cabinet and gave up office, alleging 'that he
could not hold it in connexion with an administration
likely to forward the claims of the
Catholics.' The efforts of this statesman to
oppose his views are indeed said to have been
fatal to Canning, and though Sir Robert endeavoured
to expiate his conduct by voting
three thousand pounds per annum to the son
of Canning&mdash;who, like the great Pitt, died
poor&mdash;and by passing the very measure which

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

had broken his heart, retribution was in store
for him.</p>

<p>"A connection of Canning treasured up
this wrong. For nearly twenty years&mdash;in and
out of the House&mdash;to Goodwood and the Derby&mdash;to
the Spring and October Newmarket
meetings, in the innermost recesses of his
bosom did this sensitive nobleman carry it
with him to overwhelm, at the opportune moment,
the guilty baronet "who had hunted his
noble relative to death."</p>

<p>"In 1829 Sir Robert Peel passed Catholic
Emancipation. In 1830 the expulsion of the
elder Bourbon branch took place from France
and reform was ripening. On this bill, which
the Whigs passed, I find these opinions delivered
by the baronet, before and after the
event:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This Bill (Reform) I shall oppose to the
last, believing, as I do, that the people are
grossly deluded as to the practical benefits
which they have been taught to expect from

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

it&mdash;that it is the first step not directly to
revolution, but to a series of changes which
will affect the property and alter the mixed
constitution of the country&mdash;<i>that it will be fatal
to the authority of the House of Lords</i>, and
that it will force on a series of other concessions.'</p>

<p>"After the event he says to the electors of
Tamworth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never will admit that I have been either
before or after the Reform Bill the enemy of
judicious reforms. I consider the Reform
Bill as the great and irrevocable settlement
of a great constitutional question which no
friend to the peace and welfare of this country
would attempt to disturb either by direct or
insidious means.'</p>

<p>"On the Corn Law question in 1834 he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Free trade in corn would be a gross injustice
to the owners and cultivators of the
soil.'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

<p>"In 1841, he spoke again against the Corn
Laws. I do not read to you even these little
extracts just taken at hap-hazard, for I see you
are growing impatient. I will hand you over
my notes, and you can peruse them at your
pleasure. Here is the speech by which he
introduced the Corn Law Bill in 1846&mdash;here
is the speech by which he resigned office when
he had carried it, panegyrising Cobden,&mdash;here
is the eloquent address to the Commons when
advocating the <i>repeal</i> of the union in which he
declares 'that he never was unconditionally
hostile to that measure,' and here is the <i>na&iuml;ve</i>
exclamation of the terror-stricken O'Connell.</p>

<p>" 'Och, Jasus! he is coming Brougham over
us: I defied him as an inimy, but he has sent
me to the wall as a frind.'</p>

<p>" 'O'Connell,' says the historian, ‘having
grown hoarse and old in clamouring for repeal,
by the alarm and horror he exhibited on this
occasion, recalled to every mind the old man
of the fable&mdash;kneeling on his bunch of faggots

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

and calling aloud for death&mdash;when death
really stood before him.'</p>

<p>"Here is the last speech of Sir Robert Peel.
He was four hours on his legs; you can read
it at your leisure; but it closes thus. After
expounding the five points of the charter, he
makes a valedictory address to the House of
Lords, reminding his auditors that he had
foretold that the Reform Bill would be fatal
to the authority of the Lords, and citing his
letter to the electors of Tamworth, in which,
he accepted the Reform Bill with all its consequences&mdash;consequences
of which he had
proved his knowledge; clear evidence that he
never had been inimical to the opinions of
the Charter.</p>

<p>"He winds up as follows, after repudiating
the assertion of Lord George Bentinck, who
reproached him with 'being like a rick
burner who, having set fire to a stack, was
preparing to run away by the light of it,' he
proceeds.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

<p>" 'If circumstances render it incumbent on
me now to retire from office, I surrender that
power without complaint&mdash;without repining,
and with a more lively sense of the support
and confidence which I have received, than of
the opposition I have met with.</p>

<p>" 'I shall surrender power, I fear severely
censured by some who, from no interested
motives, have adhered to superannuated institutions
as important to the welfare and interests
of the country. I shall leave behind me
a name execrated by every <i>impracticable</i>, who
from less honourable motives has adhered to
superannuated institutions as important to the
interests and welfare of the country. But, it
may be, that I shall leave a name sometimes
remembered with expressions of good will in
those places which are the abode of men
whose lot it is to labour, and to earn their
daily bread by the sweat of their brow&mdash;a name
remembered with good-will when conscious
that they have some share in self-government,

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

and are freed from that humiliating insignificance
once leavening their hearts with bitterness.</p>

<p>" 'In proposing this measure I have no wish
to rob others of the credit due to them, and I
must say with reference to gentlemen opposite,
as I say with reference to ourselves, that
we are neither entitled to the credit of it.
There has been a combination of parties, and
that combination, and the influence of government
have led to this ultimate success, but
the name which ought to be associated with
the success of this measure is not the organ
of the opposition, nor is it mine (<i>cheers</i>) the
name which ought to be and will be associated with these measures is that of a
man&mdash;I am happy to say that he is on his
way from Norfolk Island now, and has by this
time received the offer of a seat in the cabinet&mdash;a
man, who acting, I believe, from pure and
disinterested motives by untiring energy, by a

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

daring appeal to physical force, by his long
fortitude in adversity, and with an eloquence
the more to be admired because it was unaffected
and unadorned (<i>cheers, particularly
from the prosy members</i>) impressed upon the
country its necessity. The name which ought
to be associated with this measure is that of
Frost, the Chartist!' (<i>loud and prolonged
cheering</i>.)</p>

<p>" 'At this part of his speech,' say the reports,
'the right honourable baronet became insensible,
and was removed to his private residence.'</p>

<p>"Does this slight sketch, which you will
observe affords several points of view, suffice
for your purpose?"</p>

<p>"Amply," replied Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>"Because if not here are notes, and extracts
for reference&mdash;stock speeches altered to suit
various occasions&mdash;graces of self-sacrifice&mdash;airs
of political abdication, a fourth and fifth

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

time repeated. Some eminently suggestive.
Credit assumed for the moral courage exhibited
in the acknowledgment of error. If
you wish to place him in a favourable light,
you may observe that besides passing all the
great measures for a quarter of a century, that
no statesman either before or after him ever had
the opportunity of displaying so much of that
kind of heroism."</p>

<p>"I don't," replied Middleman Cautious.
"So comparing him to our own Sir Jasper, I
shall moralise on the incredible fact that when
a statesman had been, according to his own
admission, utterly mistaken nine times out of
nine, how the tenth any political party should
ever have been found to place the remotest
confidence in his opinions.</p>

<p>"And what were the opinions reciprocally
entertained, at that time, by the Continent, of
England, and by England of the Continent?"
asked Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>"On the Continent, all parties seemed to

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

have agreed the English people as an aggregate
of the most crafty, astute, designing, and
foresighted and unscrupulous politicians who
had ever existed.</p>

<p>"The English people, as a mass, till free
trade broke through their indifference, knew
little of the Continent and cared still less.
Shall I read this brief sketch of the political
condition of the chief civilised countries?"</p>

<p>"If it is very short," replied Middleman
Cautious; "for I confess that I am like the
British public in 1846."</p>

<p>"The East of Europe," continued Grubout
Florid, "was an unredeemed despotism;
Russia and Poland were the private property
of a Tsar&mdash;Nicholas the unforgiving&mdash;who,
delighting in the torture of political
opponents, caused women to be flogged to
death, and sent a quarter of a million of his
subjects to Siberia, and who, possessing twenty
one millions out of forty five millions of
slaves as his private property, appears to have

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

been a potentate much esteemed by many
consistent characters in England, who, after
hastening to bid him welcome, refused with
horror to drink Brazilian sugar because the
produce of slave labour, and recorded votes
in Parliament accordingly. Three reasons
qualified the unpopularity of Russia, which
meant the Tsar in England: first, he was
rich; secondly, he was powerful; and thirdly,
there were not a few who in their hearts
respected the state of things he represented,
and expressed this sentiment, which they dared
not openly avow, by sneering at the Poles, or
slandering those who exposed the Russian
despotism.</p>

<p>"The Poor Law Commissioners are said to
have had his bust and a map of his empire hung
up in their board-room at Somerset House,
and, pending the Andover enquiry, are related
often to have glanced at it with a sigh,
ejaculating, "happy country!"</p>

<p>"The Austrian Empire&mdash;a mixture of races&mdash;was

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

a concrete of divers limited franchises
(which its government had been too cowardly
to destroy) embedded in a homogenous mass
of despotism. An imbecile Prince reigned
over it, and it was governed by a sort of
mayor of the palace&mdash;a Machiavelian old man
who, with one foot in the grave, was planning
incendiarism and murder.</p>

<p>"Austria was popular in England, because
the chief notions connected with it were the
magnificence, the picturesque costume, the
<i>lovely</i> jewels, and the <i>splendid</i> plumes of its
representative, always some Hungarian, whose
family and wealth the government dreaded,
and whom they lured by that dignity from all
opposition and into the speedy dissipation of
his fortune.</p>

<p>"Prussia was equally a despotism, but an
enlightened despotism; that is to say, a thoroughly
arbitrary government frightened into
specious pretences by the vicinity of constitutional
countries, and enlivening its subjects

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

by occasional promises of a constitution which
for many years had become a periodic joke.</p>

<p>"The Italian states were Austrian, or, until
the accession of an independent Pope, in the
condition of states tributary to Austria, which
imposed on their rulers as the price of its
protection the difficult task of governing them
worse than its own.</p>

<p>"This was ingeniously achieved by rendering
them almost as arbitrary and many degrees less
orderly.</p>

<p>"All countries west of these, whether cisatlantic
or transatlantic, were blessed with forms
of government more or less free, only that they
might be divided into two classes; the one
consisting of states such as England, France,
Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, and the
United States, with some notion of the rational
enjoyment of the constitutions they possessed.
The others, to wit, Spain, Portugal, Mexico,
and the South American Republicans, with
about as much knowledge of such enjoyment

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

as a South Sea Islander might display of the
uses of the theodolite.</p>

<p>"John Bull only regarded these populations
with qualified favour, after he had lent them
some fifty millions sterling, which they had
never refunded, and public opinion resolved
itself into the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'They are not fit for freedom; they don't
know the use of freedom. It ought to be
taken away from them,' said one party.</p>

<p>" 'They don't know how to use freedom,'
said the other, 'agreed; but how will they
ever learn, if you deprive them of it? You
might as well take away my instrument to
improve my playing on the fiddle.'</p>

<p>"These states fell into a chronic revolutionary
state which baffled the interest of the most
determined politicians; and at the period in
question their chief uses appear to have been
in the estimation of the press, to furnish three
parts of a monthly column, which was kept

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

standing in type with the account of a change
of government.</p>

<p>"These revolutions occurred as regularly as
spring tides&mdash;so regularly that their absence
might have produced that sensation which
their occurrence had ceased to occasion.</p>

<p>"In January there was a <i>pronunciamento</i> in
Spain; in February, a revolution in Mexico;
in March a change of government in Portugal;
in April, May, June, political changes in the
South American Republics; and in July and
August, Spain and Portugal were ripe for
fresh revolt.</p>

<p>"Lost, perplexed, and bewildered, the only
thing John Bull at length insisted on was,
that for the protection of British subjects and
property, these states should not make revolutions
out of their turn; but that Portugal
should wait till Spain had done, and that
Spain should not begin again till these movements
had fairly gone the round.</p>

<p>"I now come to Sir James Graham, a statesman

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

of an indisputably <i>enquiring turn of mind</i>.
This biography is enveloped in much mystery
for two reasons; the first is, that towards the
middle and close of the nineteenth century his
name became a sort of bye-word, bearing
the same signification as Paul Pry, in the
early part of it&mdash;an epithet, no doubt, derived
from some public character of that period,
who would have saved the historian much
labour if he had earlier directed his attention
to the accounts of an Alderman named Gibbs,
whose secretive tendencies much occupied the
public attention in his day. This confusion of
the proper name of Sir James Graham with the
epithet has been the source of much perplexity,
still further increased by the fact that this
name was eventually changed by the owner.</p>

<p>"The heathen deities had different attributes
and symbols. Apollo, as the god of light,
wisdom, poetry, and medicine&mdash;as the protector
of mankind, and as the unrivalled
archer&mdash;was sometimes represented with

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

bow and shafts guiding the horses of the sun,
handling his seven-stringed lyre, or grasping
his victorious spear, or girt by snakes, and
holding in his hand an image of the graces.</p>

<p>"So the memory of Sir James Graham has
been transmitted to us, associated sometimes
with recollections of a sponge and hammer,
sometimes with the tube of a clay tobacco-pipe,
which he holds in one hand, whilst he
smiles complacently on a miniature group of
the poor law commissioners, supported in the
other, and secures under his elbow a small
pamphlet upon corn and currency.</p>

<p>"The sponge alludes to a proposition much
dwelt on by the personage in question, in the
early part of his career, to wipe out the national
debt in a very summary manner.</p>

<p>"The hammer is typical of the process supposed
to have been resorted to by the worthy
baronet, for the purpose of carrying on the
post office <i>espionage</i> with (which his name appears
to have been universally connected,)

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

because the impression of the seals of letters
was taken by placing over them a smooth
piece of lead, and indenting it with a smart
blow of a hammer.</p>

<p>"The tube of the tobacco-pipe heated at one
end, and blown through by the operator at
the other, was the means employed to dissolve
the seal after an impression of it had been
taken, so that it might be re-sealed and forwarded
to its owner, without exciting his suspicions.</p>

<p>"In the popular belief this inquisition constituted
the chief occupation of Sir James
Graham, the rest of his time having been occupied
with schemes for reducing the famine-ration
of the paupers, and increasing their personal
discomfort.</p>

<p>"His pamphlet on corn and currency has
not been transmitted to us, which is the less
surprising, that he is said, when he changed
sides, to have bought up every copy.</p>

<p>"We are assured (though it is still doubtful

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

whether the fact can be taken in its literal
sense) that part of this work&mdash;probably versified&mdash;was
set by Balfe to music as an original
composition, to the tune of</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Oh no we never mention it."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>"It appears, however, to have been the accredited
opinion of those better informed than
the vulgar, that Sir James delighted in arbitrary
forms and institutions.</p>

<p>"The whigs are supposed to have introduced
the new poor-law for the purpose of retaining
him in their ranks, and the conservatives
frankly to have adopted it as the means of
inducing him into apostacy and determined
literary infanticide of the book in question.
By such little indulgences he was retained
faithful to his new colours.</p>

<p>"According to the popular tradition of those
days a foreigner climbing up a lamp-post, opposite
Whitehall, is said to have caught Sir

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

James with hammer and blow-pipe, busily employed in
opening the letters addressed to the
discoverer. It appears, however, indisputable,
that such a charge was brought and proven
against him by a certain Italian, named Mazzini,
described by the friends of Sir James&mdash;for
he had friends if only the poor-law Commissioners&mdash;as
a turbulent and unruly character; but who appears, by the establishment
of a gratuitous school, to have done more for
the cause of humanity and instruction, even as
an exile in a strange land, than many of the
ministers thereof.</p>

<p>"This matter being brought before the
House, elicited, to the general indignation, that
this was a favourite pursuit of the Home Secretary,
but one sanctioned by the example of
his predecessors, and by some obsolete enactment,
like those which inflict penalties on
witchcraft. No one doubted that once brought
to light, this odious relic of corrupt and arbitrary
times would have been immediately abolished;

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

but they were mistaken, it was retained with slight modification in compliment
to Sir James Graham.</p>

<p>"Would for the sake of the national honour,
that this contemptible inquisition into private
correspondence&mdash;which a despotic government
may palliate on the tyrant's plea&mdash;necessity;
but for which, there is no excuse in a constitutional
state, had been resorted to for the
mere gratification of the ministers' prying propensities,
but alas! the secrets thus surprised&mdash;the
secrets of the weak&mdash;were gratuitously betrayed
to the strong&mdash;and worse than this, there
is much reason to believe that they proved indirectly
fatal to some of the most choice and
chivalrous spirits of a country, who could so ill-spare
them in her profound abasement.</p>

<p>"Attilio and Emilio Bandiera sprung from an
old patrician family of Venice, which in the
days of her prosperity had furnished Doges to
the ocean queen. Its two last scions
were brought up in the naval service of the
despotism to which Venice had been given

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

over, when she had become an apanage of Austria&mdash;that
is to say, of a weak-minded prince,
whose time was spent in counting hoarded
treasures, or in turning toys, and of an old
man who governed in his name, a Machiavel in
everything but genius.</p>

<p>"When an English expedition captured Acre,
and stayed the progress of the victorious arms
of Ibrahim, an Austrian fleet co-operated
with the English.</p>

<p>"In this Austrian fleet, manned by Italians,
the Bandieras held high rank, and won from
their allies golden opinions, which were both
privately and officially expressed.</p>

<p>"The two young men who had lived almost
exclusively on shipboard, brooding over the
ignominy of serving a government oppressive
of their country and pernicious to humanity,
could only derive confirmation in their opinions
from intercourse with the mariners of the free
people, with whom they had fought so gallantly
side by side.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

<p>"They felt too, that they had to wipe from
their escutcheon, the blot by which their father
the Admiral Bandiera had stained it, by arresting,
in 1831, in violation of the treaty of Ancona,
the Italian patriots on their way to
France.</p>

<p>"They were not men of desperate fortunes to
whom adventure offered tempting prospects,&mdash;not
youths whom enthusiastic reverie had betrayed
into inconsiderate rashness, but distinguished
members of an eminently practical
profession, in which success had hitherto crowned
their exertions, and on which a career full of
promise was before them.</p>

<p>"They were not either of that sanguine
temperament, which, blind to consequences,
rushes to the strife for danger's sake&mdash;but
mild, contemplative, affectionate men bound by
the restraint of strong domestic ties.</p>

<p>"Attilio writes to Mazzini:</p>

<p>" 'I am rather feeble in body, ardent at heart,
very often cold in appearance.'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

<p>"Emilio was distinguished by his piety.</p>

<p>"They both dearly loved their mother, and
Attilio had a wife (who afterwards died
of grief) and a child, to whom he was
passionately attached. Yet, sacrificing all
these considerations, they deliberately and
without illusion, took arms against a sea of
troubles; for illusion they had none; they
knew that they must perish, but it was their
belief&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">'That Italy would live, when Italians should have
learned to die.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Denounced to the Austrian government they
escaped to Corfu. Alarmed at so important a
defection, the Austrian government despatched
their mother with offers of pardon and restoration
to their rank and honours: but resisting
the temptation of her entreaties and her tears,
Attilio, who writes, that her reproaches struck
like poniards into his bosom, replied,</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

<p>" 'That no affection should detach him from
the service he had embraced; and that the flag
of a sovereign might be abandoned, but that of
his country&mdash;never!'</p>

<p>"Here they were joined by another Italian
naval officer from an Austrian ship, Domenico
Moro, 'young, beautiful and brave;' who, true
to his friendship and his country, joined them,
saying,</p>

<p>" 'We have lived, loved, and suffered together&mdash;together
let us die.'</p>

<p>"Panting for action, they watched eagerly
the opportunity to draw the sword for Italy,
whilst their friends sought to restrain their
ardor, so that they might prove, some day,
the triumphant champions of that cause, for
which they had devoted themselves to martyrdom.</p>

<p>" 'Jealous of preserving, for better combined
efforts, two such precious lives, we struggled
desperately,' says Mazzini, 'against the

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

fatality of the idea which dragged them
on!'</p>

<p>"At length, the Italian governments, having
received <i>information from England</i> of the
dangerous attempt, combining, decoyed them
into their territories by means of '<i>an agent
provocateur</i>' or spy, sent to tempt them by
false accounts of discontent and insurrection
amongst the Italian population.</p>

<p>"On the 11th of June, 1824, Attilio, preparing
to set sail, wrote to Mazzini:</p>

<p>" 'Life has only been given to us to employ
it usefully and nobly; and the cause
for which we are about to combat and to die,
is the purest and holiest that has ever warmed
human breast.'</p>

<p>"They landed, they were betrayed and captured,
and on the 25th of June Attilio and
Emilio Bandiera, together with seven of their
companions, were shot to death at Cosenza at
five in the morning.</p>

<p>" 'Awakened the morning of the day from

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

a tranquil sleep they dressed themselves with
care,' says Mazzini, 'and even with a sort
of elegance as if preparing for a religious
solemnity. They said to the Catholic priest,
'we have sought to practise the law of the
gospel, and to make it triumph at the price of
our blood. We hope that our works will recommend
us to God better than your words.
Go and preach to our oppressed brethren.'
Entreating the soldiers to spare the face
made in God's image they shouted, '<i>Viva
l'Italia!</i>' and all was said.'</p>

<p>"Some months after a letter was received at
Corfu.</p>

<p>" 'I bring it forward here,' says Mazzini,
'because it must suffice to prove what men
accompanied the two brothers on their enterprise.'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

<p>" 'To Signor Tito Savelli, Exoria in Corfu.</p>

<p>" '<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>" 'I write to you for the last
time, within twelve hours I shall be no more.
My companions in misfortune are the two
brothers Bandiera, Moro, Ricciotti, Venerucci,
Rocca, Lupatelli, and Berti. Your brother-in-law

to how many years he will be sentenced. Remember
me to your family, and all friends as
often as possible. If it be granted me I will,
before ascending to the Eternal, revisit the
Exoria. Kiss for me my Dante, (his godson,)
and all your children. When you think
proper you may make known this my fate at
Modena and to my brother, receive the affectionate

embraces of all my companions. I embrace

trembling hand, but I am tranquil, because I

cause. The friend who used to come on horseback
was our ruin.</p>

<p class="right">" 'Once more farewell.'</p>

<p>"Now, by whom was the intelligence transmitted
to the Italian Government which induced
it to entice these victims within its
reach through the agency of the friend on
horseback?</p>

<p>"Mazzini and the Italian refugees, who discovered

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

that their own letters had been opened,
have declared to the world that it was by the
English Government.</p>

<p>"Though the enquiry which took place
in the British Parliament elicited that&mdash;by an
enactment of which the public were profoundly
ignorant&mdash;Sir James Graham was entitled to
pry into private correspondence, he was not
able to deny that he had used this privilege
to betray as well as to discover the secrets of
the refugees.</p>

<p>"Nor could he even assert that, unwilling to
allow the British post-office to be made the
instrument of designs against a friendly government,
these letters had been returned to
those who sent them, or detained, or destroyed.</p>

<p>"No, insidiously re-sealed they were forwarded
to their destination to tempt the writers into
fresh confidences, which it is admitted were revealed
to their deadly enemies, and thus instead
of the passive course which lay safely

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

open to him, he choose a part actively ignominious,
even if it have not entailed upon his
head the blood of men, for which none but a
Sbirro in soul&mdash;not even a Sbirro by office&mdash;would
gratuitously have made himself responsible.</p>

<p>"The Hampden and the Falkland of England's
Civil Wars left not a name more fair or
full of promise than the Bandiera's, and the fall
of the Bandieras rests in the estimation of
Europe, and of posterity on the heads of
Ministers of the Crown of England. And
who can wonder that it should, when these
ministers were forced to admit that they had
resorted to dishonourable (if legal) means to
surprise the secret of the exiles&mdash;that they
betrayed it to their persecutors&mdash;and when
all they could allege in their defence was to
deny that this insidious denunciation had
directly led to the apprehension and death of
these unfortunates?</p>

<p>"They had many times avowedly given information

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

of the projects of the exiles. They
did not do so in the last instance, because,
ignorant of the intent of these unhappy men&mdash;a
meritorious reason for forbearance&mdash;but on
this fatal occasion the Bandieras and their
companions fell into a snare laid for them
through earlier denunciations.</p>

<p>"What wonder that some years afterwards
the debates upon that enquiry were by a
solemn enactment of the house expunged from
Hansard, or that Sir James Graham, having
retired from public life, (he was then amateur
governor of the penal settlements,) should
have petitioned Parliament to change a name
which had grown historically offensive by connexion
with that transaction?</p>

<p>"These," said Grubout Florid, setting aside
with some diffidence a packet of notes, "were
materials for the life of Abd-el-Kader, but it
turns out to have been altogether a mistake."</p>

<p>"A mistake?" asked Middleman Cautious.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

<p>"An utter biographical misconception&mdash;or
political mystification upon which I have
wasted some pains and time, but which cost the
French people far more, to say nothing of the
vast expenditure of blood, argument, and treasure
which, during sixteen years, it occasioned.</p>

<p>"I had, unluckily, collected these materials,
when I lighted on a passage of history
which put an end to all contradiction and uncertainty
upon the subject. It refers to 1847
or 8, at which period Abd-el-Kader was
put down. His name had grown year by year
more widely bruited, and his fame had spread
so far that he was appointed provisional
director of several railway companies, and voted
the freedom of the City of London in a gold
box. Indeed several aldermen are supposed to
have attempted to present him with it, actually
crossing over the sea (during the railway panic)
for that purpose, but it is not known whether
or not the Sir Peter Laurie&mdash;whom Louis

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

Philippe caused to be stuffed, as a curiosity,
at the Tuilleries&mdash;formed one of this migration.</p>

<p>"We read in the Chronicles of the Time that
Sir Peter stuffed himself, but this of course
is a figure of speech. And it is probable
that Louis Philippe in selecting for preservation
the skin of the city dignitary, recalled the assurance
of the grave-digger in Hamlet, that
even the body of a tanner would last nine years.</p>

<p>"Abd-el-Kader was not however killed or
taken either by the Duke of Isly, or the other
half-dozen peers of France, who earned their
coronets in his pursuit.</p>

<p>"He was not put down either by Jussouf or
Lamoriciere, by horse or foot, by the Zouaves
or Spahis. A little old gentleman in a
back attic, armed only with a Dictionary, suppressed
him on the spot. By construing a single
sentence, he not only put an end to so threatening
an existence, but by the same action
furnished to the world a complete insight

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

into the actions, haunts, habits, and tactics of
the redoubtable celebrity.</p>

<p>"In a word, he put an end to pursuits and
razzias by the simple discovery that in the
Arabic</p>

<blockquote>

<table>

<tr><td><i>"Abd</i></td><td/><td><i>Will</i></td></tr>

<tr><td><i>el</i></td><td>signified</td><td><i>o'-the</i></td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Kader,</i></td><td/><td><i>Wisp."</i></td></tr>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE OUTCAST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the tumultuous city&mdash;palpitating always
with the quick pulsation of commercial life,
and now fevered by political excitement&mdash;there
wandered one, an outcast and a stranger,
companionless amidst its teeming life, and
alike devoid of kith, kin, or friendship, with
its bustling multitude, and of sympathy with
the interests agitating it.</p>

<p>Tempest had been two days in the capital.
Though disinherited of the chief secret of the
great master of his art, he derived consolation

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

from the thought, that he had rejected its possession
clogged with the condition of devoting
it to selfish or malignant purposes; and he felt
elated both with consciousness of the powers
he had mastered, and the prospect of antagonism
with the errors and the evils of the world
which lay before him.</p>

<p>Thousands of individuals have no doubt
sank into oblivion, bearing with them the
germ of mighty thoughts never developed into
maturity or action, and tens of thousands more
have fretted through existence in the deceptive
belief of such an inspiration. This was
not the case with Tempest. Gifted with great
qualities and strange knowledge, he bore about
him the peculiar stamp distinguishing those who
are not only calculated to impress, but destined
to influence their generation. Though deeply
initiated into the mysteries of nature&mdash;though
versed in the acquisitions of science and of
art&mdash;though possessed of brilliant talents and
capacious mind, and, though minutely acquainted

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

with all that historic lore recorded
of his kind, he was utterly ignorant of the
present social condition of the world, and
knew not either how to obtain a hearing from
it, or even to meet the pressure of its imminent
difficulties.</p>

<p>Let us imagine Copernicus, or Columbus,
or Sir Isaac Newton, or Lavoisier, or Watts,
carried over the space of a century or two and
dropped suddenly on the crowded quay, or
amidst the bustling mart of one of our great
cities. Notwithstanding their mighty intellect
these men, whose reputation has filled the
world&mdash;weighed down, instead of supported,
by conscious superiority&mdash;might have succumbed
to hunger in the streets, or to slow
starvation in the union before they had found
means of snatching mere subsistence from the
scrambling crowd. So it was with Tempest.
He was cold, weary, and desolate at heart
when darkness overtook him on the second day.
He had met with nothing but flippancy and

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

abruptness, and incredulity, and to overcome
these obstacles, he found that there was nothing,
in his acquirements, which he could turn to
immediate account, unless such knowledge as
might prove destructive in its tendency.</p>

<p>This was the alternative which, refused, had
led to his disinheritance of the galvanist's secret.</p>

<p>He would not then accept malevolent power,
and now, in his necessity, he would not disseminate
aught pernicious to his kind for
bread, so he wandered out of the crowd and
sat down cold, hungry, and houseless. The
peculiar solitude of loneliness amidst a multitude,
or amongst the haunts of a concentrated
population, has been so often observed as to
have become the most common-place of truisms.
Thousands of lights gleamed across the broad
river, or sparkled in distant vista through the
long alleys of the urban wood in which he had
sought his second night's refuge.</p>

<p>Every light spoke of a home, however humble,
and reminded him of the myriads sheltered

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

from the pressure of want to vegetate through
existence; whilst fate exposed to its inhospitable
and, perhaps, fatal rigour one whose
life was full of promise to others no less than
to himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he knew that this night would
pass, like the last, to give place to another day,
and that with the day would dawn fresh hope.
He would have been glad to lie down at once,
burying himself, according to his wont, in
abstract contemplation or in conjecture of the
future, till sleep descended on his eyelids;
but there were still loungers about in the place
of public resort which he had chosen as that
night's abode, and he knew that he could not
yet, without fear of being seized for vagrancy,
prostrate himself at the foot of the old tree,
whose roots had already been his pillow. He
therefore lingered in the broad path, in the
midst of the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, sometimes walking
sharply to and fro to restore the circulation,

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

at others reposing upon the benches so as to
elude alternately the cold and weariness from
which he suffered. Here and there these
benches were tenanted. He sat down on one
already occupied by a loquacious stranger, who
speedily plunged into politics, though unlike
the stray politicians picked up in public places,
his conversation was rather of an enquiring
than of a communicative turn.</p>

<p>When he asked Tempest what he thought of
the sincerity of Sir Jasper, of the merits of
the moderate leader, and of the measure of
their respective liberality, of the last debates
and of the threatened scarcity, Tempest answered
him coldly, that he had no opinion on these
subjects. When the stranger pressed him to
say what notions he thought the public entertained
respecting them, he replied, that he
was ignorant of the popular opinion.</p>

<p>Hereupon his interlocutor drew his cloak
closer around him and, wishing him good evening,
walked away.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

<p>He had not been out of sight many minutes
when Tempest descried a folded paper lying
at the foot of the seat the stranger had
quitted.</p>

<p>By the light of the next lamp he glanced at
it, thinking thereby, perhaps, to discover the
name or address of the owner.</p>

<p>Its contents, consisting of a long series of
biographical and historical queries, noted and
numbered, attracted his attention, and to while
away an hour, he amused himself by appending
brief answers in pencil to these questions, duly
referring to page, volume, and edition of the
manuscripts and works substantiating his remarks.</p>

<p>This done&mdash;in the belief that he might, probably,
never meet the owner of the manuscript
in question again&mdash;he was about to lay it down
on the bench from which he had taken it,
when he perceived the stranger hurriedly approaching him.</p>

<p>Tempest at once held up the paper.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

<p>"You have found it? How devilish lucky!"
said the stranger, "to have lost that document
just now would have been the most provoking
thing imaginable. But how is this? Here
is only one sheet&mdash;these are only my queries&mdash;where
is the other?"</p>

<p>"This is the only one I discovered," replied
Tempest.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure&mdash;you may have dropped it
further on."</p>

<p>"No," said the stranger in a tone of profound
vexation. "I came no further than
this, and I have looked carefully down the
path as I came along. The loss is irreparable
to me. These are a mere set of questions.
It is the invaluable answers to them I have
lost."</p>

<p>"If that be all," replied Tempest with a
smile, "you will find that, believing we should
hardly meet again, I have ventured to append

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

notes with my pencil. If not containing
full answers to your questions, they minutely
indicate where you can find them without much
further trouble."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have?" said the stranger, with some
curiosity, "let us see. Though," he added
glancing at the manuscript, "it is the work
of a day and night's reflection by a head
grown grey in historical research, which I
have dropped so carelessly."</p>

<p>But as he read through the annotations made
by Tempest, profound attention and evident
surprise succeeded to curiosity.</p>

<p>"This is strange," he exclaimed at length
with marked respect. "I perceive that you
are, at least, a distinguished Bibliophilist, if
not a remarkable historian and biographer&mdash;remarkable,
indeed, for one so young. You
have noted some thirty books for reference,
I see, and half a dozen of the works you
quote were mentioned, as I distinctly remember,

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

in the document I have lost. Young gentleman
I congratulate you. You must be deeply
read."</p>

<p>"I have busied myself much with books,"
replied Tempest, "I wish the study were
more profitable."</p>

<p>"It should be so to so unusual a proficient."
said the stranger, sitting down. "I am under
a double obligation to you, and venture to
found on this a claim to better acquaintance,
which I have a suspicion might prove perhaps
mutually advantageous."</p>

<p>Tempest, led on by the hints dropped by
the stranger, confessed that he was in search
of employment, and the stranger gathered
from him both a suspicion of his destitution,
and an exalted idea of his intellectual acquirements.</p>

<p>When they had conversed for nearly half an
hour, his companion appeared on the point of
making him some offer, but his preliminary
questions having elicited that the youth was

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

utterly unknown to any one in the great city
he seemed to change his mind.</p>

<p>At length, after some reflection, informing
Tempest that he was connected in a subordinate
capacity with a political journal, he proposed
that he should aid him in research and
compilation.</p>

<p>Tempest closed with an offer which promised
immediate bread and shelter.</p>

<p>The stranger, though he gave his name,
appeared embarrassed when asked for his address,
but so was Tempest, on whom the question
was retorted, till after a moment's hesitation
he resolutely replied, pointing to the root
of an old chesnut tree&mdash;</p>

<p>"I slept there last."</p>

<p>"Well," said the stranger, shocked for a moment;
but concealing this feeling, "I dare say
you are not often to be found at home in such a
lodging; what if we meet here at this hour
to-morrow?" and Tempest having assented,
he proceeded, whilst searching for his pocketbook,
to observe&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

<p>"The labourer is worthy of his hire, and
I am in your debt already&mdash;a debt I will
at once discharge, though, as in our future
transactions, less according to your merits or
my inclination, than as my poverty permits,
for we brothers of the goose-quill are all
poor enough."</p>

<p>And so he seemed, for after a long search
it was evident that he could not find cross or
coin about him.</p>

<p>At this moment the clock of Notre Dame
struck midnight, and before the sonorous response
was over, which far over the city broke
from innumerable steeples, the stranger with
a mixture of shame, concern and regret, had
taken Tempest by the hand&mdash;apologised, reiterated
his appointment for the morrow, wished
him good-night, and hurried off to obey a summons
which appeared as full of import to him
as to the King of Denmark's ghost.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">A COMPANION IN MISFORTUNE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tempest</span> consoled himself with the reflection
that one more night of discomfort, and one
more day of privation, would probably remove
the pressure of want. But this night did not pass
in solitude like the last. An hour had elapsed
since midnight, and he had just laid down, when
he was accosted by another stranger.</p>

<p>"We were neighbours last night. I thought
it was you&mdash;I have been watching you this
half hour. It is a cold night for the houseless,
sir."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

<p>"Almost too cold to sleep," replied Tempest,
who was struck with the intonation and manner
of the man addressing him.</p>

<p>"Better even this cold air breathed freely
than restraint with comfortable warmth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">Better to breathe the free air of the mountain<br/>

Than live in the walls of a palace shut up&mdash;<br/>

Better to drink the free wave of the fountain<br/>

Than wine in the thrall of its halls from the cup.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But I have half a cloak at your service."</p>

<p>"Are you too a stranger?" asked Tempest.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I was born and bred within a gunshot
of this place."</p>

<p>"And yet you are houseless?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly&mdash;for I dread being too securely
housed."</p>

<p>"A fugitive?"</p>

<p>"A fugitive&mdash;not a criminal&mdash;escaping not

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

from my enemies, but from my friends.
We are the only two denizens of these gardens
to-night."</p>

<p>"The only two out of the population of this
city&mdash;a whole million!"</p>

<p>"A motive in itself," replied the stranger;
"for sympathy and companionship. Last night
we were four, and of the four one was a drunken
man, the other a thief."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because one threw his arms round my
neck, and called me his 'saucy Charlotte,' and
because the other robbed me; I congratulate
myself on having fallen into the company of a
man of education and refinement."</p>

<p>"How can you know?" asked Tempest, "we
have never, to my knowledge, met before."</p>

<p>"We have never exchanged a syllable; I do
not know you, and yet I speak advisedly. The
fact is, I cannot bear solitude. After my
double repulse last night, I stole up to you

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

and laid on the other side of this tree. You
were sleeping, and your sleep was feverish
and troubled, for you muttered audibly, your
incoherent thoughts; but, incoherent as they
were, arguing a cultivated mind. Whilst I was
listening I fell asleep, and on waking found
that you had taken your departure during my
slumbers."</p>

<p>"I did not know that I was so much of a
somnambulist," replied Tempest, "but why
should you dread solitude, the nurse of study and
the mother of thought."</p>

<p>"I was brought up, I have told you, in the
heart of a crowded city."</p>

<p>"And have learned from habit, only to relish
life in a crowd?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! but from long isolation amongst
the multitude, I have come to dread solitude
as the worst of evils; you do not know what it
is to be perpetually alone&mdash;cut off from all
companionship and sympathy with one's species!

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

If Zimmerman had led the life that I
have led, he would have written the "Leper
of Alost." I never till yesterday, came into
contact with vulgar crime; but I would rather
herd with bandits and assassins, than live in
solitude. Man is made to congregate. Who
is there living that does not want something
from another? I am not without some such
motive in accosting you."</p>

<p>"You could not worse have addressed yourself&mdash;I
have nothing to give&mdash;not even advice,
strange as I am both to this city and to the
usages of social life."</p>

<p>"At least, you can give me your society
this night, and I augur even from
your voice, that you will not withhold your
sympathy."</p>

<p>"You may command it for any affliction,"
replied Tempest, "and if the physical affliction
of disease, I may, perhaps, soothe it more
effectually."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

<p>"I am about to ask you to do me a service,"
said the stranger, "and though to speak candidly,
I have no choice but to address myself to
you, who are the only person in these gardens;
and though I must have done so by the
thief who robbed me yesterday, if he had been
in your place, I cannot but believe that fortune
has singularly favoured me in bringing me
across your path."</p>

<p>"I never yet refused a service that lay in
my power to any human being, provided it
was not detrimental to another," replied
Tempest.</p>

<p>"Well," observed the stranger, "so much
the better, we can talk over it by-and-bye; but
just turn to the other side of the tree out of
the moonlight, lest the patrol should discover
us."</p>

<p>And so saying, he moved, and spreading his
cloak, invited his companion to lie down. As
he divested himself of this garment, Tempest
perceived that his dress rather bespoke

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

affluence than denoted misery; and having
obeyed the stranger's injunction, waited patiently
for the explanation, which, after having proffered,
he seemed timidly to defer. At least,
he flew with extreme volubility from one subject
to another, conversing upon all with ease,
and vivacity, and exhibiting the information to
be derived from much light reading, and an
acquaintance, far more valuable to Tempest,
with all the topics of the day. At length, he
turned abruptly, and put to him several questions
impossible to parry, respecting his own
origin and history.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more briefly told," replied
Tempest, "my name and parentage are enveloped
in obscurity; I have spent my life
hitherto in study; I am now seeking to translate
its thoughts into action; I am unknown
in this city; almost unknown to any human being.
Without a home to-day, but with better
prospects for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Without a name! without a parentage&mdash;without

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

a lineage clogging all your steps&mdash;unknown,
and without a world of spies to dodge
and to denounce them&mdash;free as the winds of
heaven; you are a happy man," exclaimed the
stranger, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"And houseless as the winds of heaven,"
replied the youth, with a smile, "are you debarred
such liberty?"</p>

<p>"My condition is a strange one," said his
companion. "I perforce, in my solitude, have
skimmed over the superficies of literature&mdash;you
have both dived into its profundity, and revelled
on its surface; you will, therefore, recall,
if I remind you of it, some fragment of a
memoir or a diary, or a tale, published some
seventy years ago, and recording how the hero
or heroine, travelling in Belgium or France, became
captivated by the appearance and address
of a youth, the chance companion of the road.
His mind had been enlarged by education, his
manners by travel. He united the urbanity
of the finished gentleman, to the acquirements

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

of the scholar, and the enthusiasm of a
poetic temperament. He was the inheritor of
vast wealth. He pointed out as they passed
by the possessions of his father&mdash;possessions of
which, the foundation had been laid three
centuries before, and transmitted in uninterrupted
line. He was not in debt&mdash;he
was not in love&mdash;he was not sick, his conscience
was at rest; and God forbid, he was
not ambitious since he longed to change
his lot with that of the roadside beggar&mdash;yet
he was miserably unhappy. He complained
that the hereditary brand of Cain was on his
brow; 'he had spent some happy hours in the
society of his present companions,' he said, 'and
such sweet converse, was Elysium to him,
but after he had quitted them, he should shun
their path like the wolf, to avoid their loathing
and their pity;' and thus, with tears in his eyes,
he took his leave. From this conduct, the
travelling party came to the conclusion
that he was insane. They had almost forgotten

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

the circumstance when traversing the same road
one of them exclaimed,</p>

<p>" 'Look&mdash;that is the country seat of the
father of that fine young man who is deranged.'</p>

<p>" 'That,' said an old man from the neighbourhood,
ensconced in the corner of the
coach, 'is the property of <i>the hereditary executioner</i>.'</p>

<p>"Highly paid, because&mdash;besides the endowment
of perquisites, which had doubled and
doubled again since their first institution&mdash;these
officials received as much for an execution,
as the most skilful surgeon for an operation,
and without temptation to expenditure, because,
cut off from all communication with
society, these men accumulated wealth. They
gave education to their children; but social
prejudice sternly debarred them from any
other career, however humble, than that followed
by their fathers; and still more inexorably

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

restricted them to matrimonial alliances
with the families of their fellows in the trade
of blood."</p>

<p>"I have read that such was the case with
the headsmen formerly," replied Tempest, "but
that office has fallen into desuetude with the
abolition of the punishment of death."</p>

<p>"True," said the stranger, "but can you
conceive anything more fearful than the
cruel solitude to which society condemned these
unfortunates?"</p>

<p>"There is no limit to the varieties of human
misery," replied Tempest, "but I trust that
such anomalies have ceased."</p>

<p>"What an illusion! Look down the avenues
of the opposite gardens; whence are those
lights glimmering? From the palace of the
Tuilleries. Now tell me what is the condition
of the royal puppets whom those walls imprison?
In what, I pray you, as they sit without a
shadow of their former power, amidst the

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

wreck of their departed state&mdash;in what is their
fate preferable to that of the executioner's
family of old?"</p>

<p>"I know that royalty has fallen, but surely
scarce so low as you contend?"</p>

<p>"Your young head is like that of some secluded
grey beard, rich with the experience of
the past, and ignorant of how far the world
has progressed since he was young. Kings and
their families were proudly isolated from their
people by etiquette, and debarred from intermixture
of their blood, with any but the blood of
royalty when <i>above</i> their subjects; but this
exclusiveism tells wofully against them now
that they have fallen below them in condition.
Now that they have sunk into a caste&mdash;the
only European caste&mdash;a something between
the Mikado of Japan, the grand Lama of Thibet,
and the Hindostanee Pariah.</p>

<p>The people of the United Monarchies have
accepted royalty indeed&mdash;they have preserved
upon their thrones the dynasties occupying

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

them, because they considered the forms of
monarchy the most convenient.</p>

<p>"But the principle has been long since adopted
in a Utilitarian age, of proportioning the
salary of all office to its requirements, and the
nation, reasoning that, after all, the steadiness
and capacity of a good beadle would make
(taking kings throughout history all in all)
a tolerable King&mdash;have reduced the emoluments
of Royalty pretty well to the level of
the perquisites of beadledom."</p>

<p>"But even though it be an empty pageantry,"
said Tempest, "the halo of State
assuredly encircles kingcraft, impotent though
it be?"</p>

<p>"You shall judge," said the stranger, "imagine
yourself the royal tenant of that palace,
conscious that in your veins the blood of
every illustrious line of European Princes
flowed in commingling current&mdash;imagine your
bosom swelling with the recollections of what
your ancestors had been, and the knowledge

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

of what you were&mdash;recollections forced on you
every hour by each surrounding object. Every
picture hanging on those walls, each faded
rag of royalty adorning them, each statue in
those gardens recalling the splendour or the
power of your kingly predecessors. Imagine
yourself not able to contemplate the shade of
those horse-chesnut trees, or those formal alleys
of trim limes, or that avenue lined with
its centennial orange trees without remembering
how these umbrageous walks had been trodden
even in the last days of monarchy by princes
whose mere word was law, or who even in its
declining glory had a will more potent than
the collective voices of whole assemblies in a
nation's destiny, and whose hands could still dispense
sufficient favour to secure the adulation
of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Here Louis the Fourteenth, rendering monarchy
odious, wandered with his mistresses
and his confessor&mdash;here Louis the Fifteenth
followed in his steps, making royalty contemptible.

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

Here the Sixteenth monarch of
that name&mdash;the Charles the First of France,
and of the House of Bourbon&mdash;paying the
penalty of that odium and contempt, may
have meditated on its growing dangers. These
orange trees have given their blossoms to
adorn the toilet of princesses of the House of
Hapsburg. Here, bent upon conquest, Napoleon's
booted heel has impatiently indented
the broad path. On these balconies and terraces
the selfish Louis Dix-huit, sunning himself,
like a huge turtle, may have muttered
complacently as he foresaw the approaching
storm&mdash;the motto that epitomised his policy&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'<i>Apr&egrave;s moi la fin du monde</i>.'</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>"Here the libertine king, become the bigot,
thought of the morrow's battue, whilst France
was convulsed beneath his footsteps as the earth
heaving to the struggles of a buried Titan.
To these halls, from which Charles the Tenth

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

fled with unsheathed sword, Louis Philippe
stole with umbrella under arm, having picked
up the crown his predecessor had let drop.
Here he reigned by his wisdom and his gold,
and hence he burrowed like the fox, making
the Tuilleries a castle of Udolpho, and honeycombing
all its environs, so that when
surprised by a <i>coup de main</i>, the conspirators
found nothing but his coat, hat, and garters,
the majesty of France having dived into the
earth to pop out again in safety many miles
away. Across the road&mdash;close to the pedestal
of the bronze lion, the subterranean passage
still, to this day, exists, running through the
terrace opposite the Seine, and threading the
place du Carousel, and the soil beneath our feet,
to communicate with excavations which lead
as far as Neuilly. Here his royal son-in-law,
Hudson, the railway king, to whom&mdash;a widowed
pair&mdash;he gave his widowed daughter,
may, like an old spider, have meditated which
portion of the globe he should next overspread

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

with his lines, and have calculated how dear,
how slow, and how insecure he might venture
upon making them.</p>

<p>"In fact, finding around you everywhere the
reminiscence or the trace of majesty allied
to omnipotence or power, or, at least, to colossal
wealth, and then reflecting that it had devolved
on you shorn of every attribute, but
its restraint and onerous ceremonial. Imagine
your palace converted into public offices&mdash;your
Majesty habitually banished to the apartments
of a third floor&mdash;the halls of state, except
on public occasions, '<i>en papillotes</i>,' the
pictures covered up, the frames in gauze, the
carpets druggeted, the tassels in bags, the hangings
rolled away, and an inexorable major
domo watching the preservation of the nation's
furniture. Imagine the kingly office limited in
the means of its support by economy so strict
as barely to suffice to the occasional pageantry
rigorously exacted, and kings and their families
made to understand that the people supported

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

them&mdash;like a beadle or coachmen in their state
liveries&mdash;chiefly to do it credit on great occasions,
but that at all other times they must lay
these trappings up in lavender and keep out
of sight, not to offend the ostentatious pride
of their employers by exhibiting the sordidness
of their every day attire."</p>

<p>"But, at least," suggested Tempest, "royalty
has gained in this respect, that it forcibly lays
aside the panoply of majesty in ordinary life?"</p>

<p>"Not so;" replied his companion, "there is
a conventional dignity, part and parcel of
the office which must be rigorously sustained.
The beadle or parish clerk, even when off
duty, dare not jump over a post, or play at leap-frog.
A sovereign and his family must not
appear in public without due honours. A royal
prince must not move abroad without salvos of
artillery; but as honours are costly, and gunpowder
expensive, the monarch and his
children are shut up in the former seclusion
of a sultan's harem."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

<p>"And is such really the condition of present
royalty?" asked the youth.</p>

<p>"Such is the condition of French royalty,"
replied the stranger, "not the worst off in
Europe either, let me tell you, thanks to a
lingering leaven of the national vanity and
love of splendor. Though it be true that in
France the royal race is parsimoniously isolated
from society in forced retirement, and, though
all its younger branches, forbidden to derogate
by any mis-alliance, are doomed to celibacy
as well as solitude, they still enjoy the affluence
of the middle classes; but there are
other of the Federative Monarchies in which
the reigning families are even worse cared for.
There is the kingdom of Bavaria, in which
the sole support of the crown is derived from
the gratuities paid by strangers who visit the
Valhalla; and there are the Netherlands,
whose sovereign is found in nothing but coals,
candles, houseroom, a suit of clothes at Christmas,
and thirty shillings a week; for which,&mdash;besides

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

making an opening and closing speech
to the States-general&mdash;he is bound to brush, as
well as wear, the royal robes, and furbish up
the crown jewels.</p>

<p>"Why even at the last period preceding the
decline of royalty, princes&mdash;now treated with
such indifference and neglect&mdash;were at least
thought worth encouraging or reviling.</p>

<p>"I find by reference to the Times of 1846,
that three years previously a transaction took
place between the East Berkshire Agricultural
Association and Prince Albert, the consort
of Queen Victoria the First of England,
in which a two pounds testimonial is mentioned
thus:&mdash;"<i>His Royal Highness Prince
Albert for (as?) a labourer for having brought
up a large family without seeking parish relief</i>,
&pound;2."</p>

<p>Now this passage, though obscure, will only
admit of four interpretations. Either that two
pounds were paid by the Prince to reward
the industrious exertion of a life, and in that

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

case, perhaps, out of the sums his Highness
had received as prizes for fat cattle; or else
that they were awarded to a peasant, who in
the employ of Prince Albert, had contrived to
avoid the Union. Or to Prince Albert
himself for having enabled one of his labourers
to rear his children without the
aid of parish bread; or last, fourthly
and most plausibly, the two pounds were
awarded to that illustrious personage himself,
for having brought up a large family without
seeking parish relief&mdash;a feat which history
records him to have accomplished.</p>

<p>"Now whether as a gift <i>from</i> him, or <i>to</i> him,
forty shillings was a small testimonial certainly,
considering that he had thirty
thousand per annum, but it was at least
sufficient to prove that the public of that
day was disposed to make the most of
any little merits he might possess. Princes
were then maligned or praised, and even
in the last hours of royal popularity we

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

may gather on the authority of a Spanish
paper, that the sons of Louis Philippe were
received by the waving of two pocket handkerchiefs,
and threatened by a regicide on the
same day, 'more than one handkerchief,'
says the Heraldo, 'was waved in the air, more
than one smile worthy of envy responded to
so much grace allied to so much dignity.'</p>

<p>"This contrast, however&mdash;hard though it
may be&mdash;is not the hardest part of the case. It
may be well for those who choose to accept the
phantom royalty of our time to submit to its
conditions&mdash;but is it not a glaring injustice
that these should unavoidably descend like
their fathers' sins upon their children?</p>

<p>"Yet so it is with the reigning family of these
realms. An old man, the shadow of impotent
sovereignty, wears the crown. His next of
kin is a nephew with too much sense of his
manlike dignity voluntarily to accept so insignificant
a part. He only wishes to step down
from the foolish and inconvenient eminence,

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

on which the accident of birth has raised him,
into the ranks of the people, yet even this
privilege is denied him.</p>

<p>" 'Stay, my friend,' say the millionaries,
'one moment, if you please; we do not
live in an age when princes were allowed to
abdicate rights present or prospective&mdash;but just
as we did not then allow the private soldier to
resign his musket, so now we keep our princes
in the ranks, and dutifully coerce them to play
their part in that state to which it has pleased
Providence to call them.</p>

<p>" 'We cannot afford to risk any slur being
thrown on that royalty, our property, by the
derogation of unworthy members&mdash;we cannot
brook to see its regular succession interrupted.
You must therefore remain a prince, you
must not associate&mdash;you must not intermarry
out of your caste.'</p>

<p>"The Hereditary Prince&mdash;determined to vindicate
the rights to which he thought every
man inalienably born prepared hereupon&mdash;petitioned

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

the Federal Parliament to be allowed
to descend, or rather to ascend into private
life; but this step proved his ruin. The ministers
and magnates declared that he was insane.</p>

<p>"With all the mock formula of respectful
loyalty they resorted to confinement, and even
to the straitjacket, the lancet, and the blister,
when their victim grew outrageous. Yet
even two years of such enthralment did not
subdue his spirit. He watched his opportunity&mdash;he
took wing&mdash;he breathed the free air of
heaven&mdash;he communed with his kind&mdash;but
alas! cut off from all intercourse with them for
so long, there were none to sympathise with
him&mdash;and he was without friend, or well-wisher
in the great city. He could find no refuge&mdash;he
felt that he was tracked&mdash;that far and wide
they were searching for him; but two nights
he had baffled them because he came&mdash;like a
hunted hare returning to its form&mdash;where
they least suspected, within sight of the very

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

walls from which he had fled, and laid down at
the foot of this old tree, for it is he who craves
a favour of you now."</p>

<p>"What," said Tempest, "you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am the unfortunate Count of Paris, heir
to this largest of the Federal kingdoms."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the youth, looking at him
with some interest, and then recollecting that
his companion had just avowed his escape from
a place of confinement for mental alienation, he
made no comment lest he should irritate his
malady.</p>

<p>"Well," said the stranger, "I can hear by
the tone of your voice that, like all the world,
your interest in me has vanished now you
know me to be a royal prince. If I had confided
to you that I was a pirate or a Thug, or
even a fugitive from the galleys, you might
have listened to me with horror but with interest.
I suppose that now your indifference
will refuse me even the service I was about to
ask you?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

<p>"You are in error," replied Tempest. "I
should be glad to do anything in my power
which might be useful to you."</p>

<p>"Then listen," said his companion. "I
have been three days at large, but to remain
so, much longer, is impossible. In a day&mdash;in
an hour I may be hurried back to my confinement.
There is one whom I have vainly
sought to see&mdash;one whose sympathy solaced the
early solitude to which I have been doomed&mdash;need
I say it was a woman. I have not been
able even to communicate with her. Could I
trust to you to see that this letter reaches her;
will you promise me by your honour, by your
soul; by all that you hold most dear, that it
shall, or must the descendant of St. Louis implore in
vain?"</p>

<p>"Give it me," said Tempest, endeavouring
to soothe the agitation of the stranger, who
having entrusted to him his missive with many
exhortations, retired to rest.</p>

<p>The two sleepers were at length awakened

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

not by the dawn of morning, but by a police
agent supported by several gate-keepers ranged
at a respectful distance, and ready to advance
at his beck.</p>

<p>"Quite right!" exclaimed the official. "It
is he."</p>

<p>And then doffing his cocked hat, he addressed
Tempest's companion in a whisper deferentially
impertinent.</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness has given us much
trouble, I have followers at hand to assist your
Royal Highness home. Your Royal Highness
must be pleased to lead the way to that
vehicle."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the personage addressed, looking
round him to ascertain that escape was
impossible. "A curse on your officious persecution."</p>

<p>"You too," said the official to Tempest,
"must follow me&mdash;we will endeavour to ascertain
what connivance you have had in seducing
the heir apparent from his friends."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

<p>"None," replied Tempest, "my present
companion accosted me as I lay here last
night."</p>

<p>"Then you were confessedly vagabondising,"
observed the official. "As you have
not the appearance of a beggar, you must be
a criminal, let me look to my notes. Ah! I
have it&mdash;two birds with one stone. Height
five feet ten, brow high, expression sinister,
speech fluent and pedantic. Do you call yourself
Tempest, young man?"</p>

<p>"I am called Tempest."</p>

<p>"You are my prisoner then."</p>

<p>"On what charge?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, not on any that I know of,
excepting want of wit. Here it is in black and
white&mdash;a monomaniac escaped from his friends&mdash;gentle
and plausible, but very dangerous&mdash;to
be immediately secured."</p>

<p>And Tempest finding expostulation futile,
and separated from his companion, was being
led away, when the party was accosted by his

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

last night's friend, who muffled up in a cloak
appeared in search of him.</p>

<p>"Good God, not a criminal?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the official, "only an insane
patient."</p>

<p>On receiving which assurance the new comer
hastily exchanged a few words with Tempest,
and after expressing his belief that he was the
victim either of mistake or persecution, assured
him both of his ability and determination
to see to effect his speedy liberation.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">ANTICIPATIONS OF VICTORY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Antipathetic</span> sympathy&mdash;more powerful than
any predilection in common&mdash;together with
the impending crisis, had brought the Ladies
Sabina and Floranthe together.</p>

<p>"It was high time," said the former "to
rally round Sir Jasper. The pressure from
without, occasioned by the scarcity, shows
clearly that we could not have held out, and
all prolongation of the struggle now serves
only to give political ascendancy to an element
socially extraneous and repulsive. I had

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

hoped that the Cashes, with their wealth and
influence, would have been absorbed into our
ranks by intermixture with a patrician family."</p>

<p>"So I had flattered myself, but oil and
water will sooner mingle than they assimilate
with us. It is impossible to endure their
assumption, and the ridicule of their vulgarity."</p>

<p>"No one can feel it more keenly than the
bride's father."</p>

<p>"Except the husband of the bride; but the
Lady Calliro&euml; has not fulfilled the mission
which her station imposed upon her, and
makes common cause with them against us,
abetting the old man in his arrogance and
ambition."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is time, as I was saying," observed
the Lady Sabina, "that this contest&mdash;this
revolution should be ended. It is our bounden
duty to strain every nerve to support Sir
Jasper in the demolition of the doomed edifice,

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

that he may then speedily reconstruct
another more suitable to the exigences
of the time, more durable and more secure."</p>

<p>"But in this work our joint efforts are
nothing to the co-operation of old Cash," said
the Lady Floranthe bitterly.</p>

<p>"So long as the battle is undecided. But
there is one advantage in the demolition of
the former state of things, that we shall reconstruct
on a new basis. Our order has succumbed
through an elemental weakness, because
it admitted too hastily within its pale
mere vulgar wealth in all its plebeian grossness&mdash;unrefined
and unannealed."</p>

<p>"And, because our reverend Seignors, too,
jealously excluded us from their councils.
But what says Sir Jasper? Did you press
him in our joint names&mdash;did you extract anything
from him but a shrug&mdash;a nod&mdash;a hint
blandly uncompromising?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Lady Sabina, "Sir Jasper
has unbosomed himself at last; and has spoken

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

unreservedly and satisfactorily. He perceives
distinctly that the new power by whose aid
alone he can disentangle order from inevitable
chaos, may become dangerous to him as well
as offensive to ourselves, and he therefore
implores us to wait only till his object is
secured&mdash;and then his views will be our
own."</p>

<p>"So he has vaguely hinted, but without doing
anything to curb that power."</p>

<p>" 'Why seek to curb that which one means
to break:' such were his words to me. Besides,
he argues thus: 'the more promptly and
effectually the present measure is carried, the
greater will be his popularity; and the power
derived from that popularity he will use at
once to scatter the party of the new Cr&oelig;sus,
and to clip for ever, the wings by which he
thinks to soar."</p>

<p>"Chance what may, that is a satisfaction,"
said the Lady Floranthe, "at least, materialism
will not triumph where intelligence ought

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

to reign. This man is unendurable in himself; but something tells me that the dominion
of that haughty and unnatural child his
daughter-in-law, the Lady Calliro&euml;&mdash;would be
still more difficult to brook."</p>

<p>"More odious because an apostate in her
premature ambition&mdash;but set your mind at
rest. Till the final success of Sir Jasper, it is
expedient to humour and caress John Cash&mdash;but
that triumph will be secured to-night, and
then, in the zenith of his popularity, the minister
will cast aside the instrument he was forced
to cherish, and to-morrow the parvenu will
be nothing but a worn out and abandoned
tool."</p>

<p>"Why did he not satisfy us of this before?"</p>

<p>"He dared not, till the decisive day was
come, give a dangerous assurance which might
have reached the ears of his ally."</p>

<p>"Men never trust us till it is too late," replied
the Lady Floranthe, "but we too shall
have a part to play, we must act promptly and

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

decisively in putting these people in their
place."</p>

<p>At this moment a knock was audible, and
the Lady Sabina, who was apparently expecting
Eustatius Cash, desired that he might be
refused admittance.</p>

<p>"I have this day already ordered my door
to be denied him," said the Lady Floranthe.
"Eustatius, though I sincerely pity him&mdash;forgets
that he has no longer, a hand to dispose
of, which could once proffer all the wealth of
his sire."</p>

<p>"Besides," said the Lady Sabina, slightly
colouring, "the time is come to assert our own
dignity by drawing a line which, I trust, will
prove indelible."</p>

<p>"The time is come for excluding all the
Cashes," said the Lady Sabina.</p>

<p>It was not Eustatius Cash, but the family
doctor, the oracle of all the small talk of the
higher classes, part of whose duties it was to

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

appear on certain occasions in certain houses in
the character of an ambulatory chronicle.
His presence was welcome at this moment;
he was admitted; and, though his grey eye
twinkled significantly on seeing two powers
long rivals so confidentially united, on a hint
to that effect, he disburthened himself of his
budget.</p>

<p>"All mouths," he informed them, "were
filled with expectation of the great event; and
nothing could exceed the popularity of Sir
Jasper. With the people, because supposed to
be hostile to the <i>millionaries</i>, and with the
<i>millionaries</i>, because they were confident, that he
had only saved them from an untimely end to
restore, by some political hocus pocus, their
power in another form. From Sir Jasper, by a
natural transition, the Doctor passed to Old Cash
and his family; and here, growing sad and confidential,
he imparted to them a melancholy
secret. He had just left the Lady Calliro&euml;,
and&mdash;he deeply lamented to state that young,

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

high-born, and beautiful as she was&mdash;he feared
that these gifts would prove more transitory than
is even commonly the case with frail humanity.
In fact, in that fair frame, he did
not hesitate to say, that&mdash;without some providential
interposition beyond the reach of
art&mdash;the ineradicable germ of dissolution was
already manifest."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the Lady Floranthe.</p>

<p>"Too possible," replied the Doctor; "for,
alas! I may say so here, always in the most
solemn confidence, that unhappy lady is the
unconscious victim of an insidious malady
which does not admit of cure."</p>

<p>A feeling of pity, and almost of remorse,
moistened the glance which the Lady
Sabina cast towards her fair visitress as she
thought of her own daughter, whose cheek was
often so pale; but this association gave rise
to another and a very different sentiment; for
she had once speculated on securing for that
daughter the colossal wealth which the demise

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

of the Lady Calliro&euml; would leave again disposable.
So, after a common-place expression
of sympathy, she observed:&mdash;"<i>That</i>
would be a great political fact."</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe nodded acquiescence;
but, wrapped in her own thoughts, answered
nothing. For her the words of the doctor
were full of import, because only that morning,
by a singular coincidence, an eminent
physician had encouraged her ailing (and, as
she believed, hypochondriacal husband) with
the assurance that he only suffered from the
same symptom as one of the reigning beauties
of the hour, the young Lady Calliro&euml; Cash.</p>

<p>When the Doctor had taken his leave and
the Lady Floranthe had departed, the
Lady Sabina countermanded the order she had
given, and desired that Eustatius should be
admitted.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">A SCENE IN THE SENATE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at the close of the debate upon a
question fraught with change to the very constitution
of the United Monarchies, that Middleman
Cautious sat down after an able speech, in
which he successfully appealed to the fears and prejudices
of the ultra Oligarchs&mdash;the class towards
which his hostility had been so long unceasing.</p>

<p>After a bitter personal attack upon Sir
Jasper, in which he contrasted the expression
of that minister's former opinions with those
avowed at present by him; he had drawn an
alarming picture of the various concessions into
which, one by one, Sir Jasper would unavoidably
be drawn; concessions which would become inevitable
when the initiative in a measure of reform
was assumed by a statesman who had for
so many years made inviolable immutability the
rock upon which he had based his government.</p>

<p>Change, indeed, beneficial in itself, (he contended,)

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

if carried, though by politicians of pretentions
more elastic, would become fearfully perilous
if due to the sudden relaxation of a political
inflexibility which had never known exception;
for in the eyes of all men, one might be only
the bending of the sapling or the bough, which
would quickly spring back with unimpaired
vigour into its first position, the other, the
breaking asunder of the beam, which argued
the eventual prostration of the whole edifice it
supported.</p>

<p>"To prove that his predictions of the future
were warranted by the experience of the past,
he drew from the stores of history numerous
examples; but in particular, one he cited" which,&mdash;from
its peculiar aptitude to present circumstances&mdash;appeared
in its pages like a providential
beacon, to warn the present generation of
its danger. It was that of Sir Robert Peel,
whilome prime minister of Great Britain; and
indeed, of Great Britain and Ireland, before
he repealed the act of union with the latter
country.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

<p>"They would find that the first part of that
statesman's career, was precisely identical with
that of Sir Jasper up to the present period&mdash;of
the future conduct of Sir Jasper&mdash;of the
steps into which a like necessity would hurry
him&mdash;and of their final effect on the community,
how could he furnish them with a
better means of judging, than by briefly epitomising
the subsequent period of Sir Robert
Peel's career&mdash;the past of that notorious minister's
history which it depended upon the members
of that House, by the votes they would
record upon the question before them, to prevent
from becoming the <i>future</i> of his prototype, Sir
Jasper."</p>

<p>Here the Moderate leader, primed as he was,
by the historian, went lucidly, graphically, and
profoundly, into the public life of Sir Robert
Peel. He gave his auditory the most salient and
contradictory points&mdash;the brightest white and the
darkest black&mdash;from his speeches on both sides
of every great question of the day&mdash;and after
proving the remarkable, and almost ludicrous

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

coincidence betwixt the early stage of his tergiversation
with that which Sir Jasper was
now exhibiting, he pointed out its consequences
on the British Empire, step by step, until the
very day on which Sir Robert had expired, introducing
his last bill&mdash;the charter&mdash;repudiated by
Feargus O'Connor, for his excessive Radicalism,
in a letter published in the <i>Northern Star</i>
of that eventful morning.</p>

<p>As far as any speech could produce a sensation,
the discourse of Middleman Cautious, was
prodigiously effective. The enthusiasm which
the sudden conversion of Sir Jasper had excited,
was beginning to cool down; and it was
now perceived, that in his anxiety to outbid
the Moderate leader, he had progressed beyond
that boundary, whose limits it was equally disagreeable
for Rationalists and Moderates to see
overstepped.</p>

<p>The great and the minor capitalists had, in
fact, quarrelled for supremacy amongst
themselves; but their interest, as possessors of
property, were identically opposed to the

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

masses who had none; and whom, in the heat
of the contest, Sir Jasper had called into the
struggle, and was about to invest with
power.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, nothing but the adhesion of
old Cash, his powerful party, and more powerful
example, which had, hitherto, saved Sir
Jasper from a dangerous reaction.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the arguments of
his adversary told with marvellous effect; but
what a pity that his plan of action had been
revealed to the Lady Floranthe! It is true,
that this was done with his full concurrence
and consent&mdash;because, anxious to popularise
his notion on the analogy between Sir
Robert and Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>But as the same tide cannot serve two ways,
Sir Jasper had, in this manner, become
acquainted, as the reader has seen, with
the nature of the attack meditated on him
by his opponent&mdash;and forewarned he was forearmed.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

<p>It is true, that Middleman Cautious could not
conceive any defence which would be very
effective against such an attack&mdash;but he was
deceived.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper rose amidst a universal titter,
and observed&mdash;"That in reply to the
censure which the organ of the Opposition had
been pleased to heap upon him, he could only
ask that House, what could be more puerile
than to argue a question so momentous and
practical as the one before them, upon the
grounds of a mere fanciful historic analogy?
He would tell honourable members. There <i>was</i>
one thing which might add to the ridicule of
such a proceeding, and that was an utter misconception
of the historic facts obtruded upon
so grave and practical an assembly,&mdash;the imposition
not of bootless pedantry only, but of
pedantic ignorance. Yet this misconception
he would show to have been imbibed&mdash;this imposition
to have been attempted, by the honourable
member who had just sat down.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

<p>"Every one in that house knew that all
political history, beyond the personal recollection
of the present generation, became
more obscure and clouded in proportion as
it approached our own times, on account of
the deluge of contradictory writings in which
the truth, in the estimation of the vulgar,
was hopelessly engulfed, and from which the
persevering and the learned found it so difficult
to extract it. They knew that the visitation
of Providence which twice during the last
half century had proved so fatal to all but the
young, had even prevented the memory of the
present generation from extending as far back
as, in the natural course of things, it would
have done; so that the political condition, sixty
years back, of the countries constituting
the United Monarchies was now popularly
more obscure than that of Europe five centuries
ago; and on this obscurity the leader
of the opposition had relied to fill the ears of

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

that august assembly with absurd historic fictions.</p>

<p>"The honourable member who had just sat
down had likened him to Sir Robert Peel, the
premier of Great Britain, when Great Britain
was an independent state. Now to which of
the two Sir Roberts did he liken him? For&mdash;he
spoke advisedly, on the authority of the first
historian of the age, with whom he had
casually discussed this question&mdash;<i>there were two
Sir Roberts Peel</i> who lived and flourished together,
and ruled alternately the realms of
England, reigned over by the house of
Guelph. They differed indeed widely as the
antipodes in their policy, but both were
equally consistent and remarkable in their
career. When he cited Niebuhr St. Thomas as
that authority, he would not be charged with
pinning his faith to the opinions of one credulously
erudite in these matters. A namesake&mdash;at
least partially a namesake&mdash;of this great
historian had proved, three quarters of a century

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

back, that the best part of the early
history of Rome was fabulous, and had scattered
into thin air its long accredited traditions;
but it had been reserved for the
authority he had cited to go further, for he
had proved that Rome had never been founded
at all. Niebuhr St. Thomas had been led
utterly to doubt of the existence of a Sir
Robert Peel, by the preposterous contradictions
of conduct and of opinion to be met with in
his fragmentary biography. He (Sir Jasper)
could not help saying, that for any one to
record these alleged inconsistencies without
coming to the same conclusion as Niebuhr St.
Thomas, argued a credulous simplicity which
might readily have accepted the legends of the
Roman wolf and of the nymph of Numa&mdash;unless,
indeed, they had fallen upon the true
solution due to the perseverance and ingenuity
of his learned friend.</p>

<p>"In fact, it was obvious that Sir Robert
Peel must have been a personage entirely figurative,

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

as some have even thought the two
feminine politicians of that day&mdash;the Mrs.
Harris and the Mrs. Gamp&mdash;to have been; it was
obvious that there could never have been any, or
that there must have been two Sir Roberts; and
this inference, which common sense dictated, was
triumphantly borne out by documents which the
unremitting zeal of the historian in question
had brought to light. He had discovered a
pamphlet entitled "The National Debt productive
of National Prosperity," published in
1780, by one Robert Peel.</p>

<p>"In 1778, the birth of that Sir Robert
Peel who passed the abolition of the corn
laws is recorded. Now he (Sir Jasper) submitted
to the members of that House, whether
the statesman alluded to could have written
a pamphlet on the national debt, or on any
other subject eight years before he was
born?</p>

<p>"It may be said, that Robert Peel, or,
Mr. Robert Peel, might easily be a distinct

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

character from Sir Robert Peel; but he
could prove that both these personages were
called indifferently <i>Mr</i>. Robert or <i>Sir</i> Robert.</p>

<p>"From 1802 to 1820, we have positive
proof that the author of the pamphlet sat in
the British Parliament on many occasions as
<i>Sir</i> Robert Peel; we know it was he, because
he makes allusion to that work as his own.
Now, in 1809, we find the other Peel called in
parliament <i>Mr</i>. Peel, and on other occasions <i>Sir</i>
Robert. Both had pursued a consistent and
honourable career.</p>

<p>"Now, if the organ of the opposition compared
him to the Sir Robert No. 1&mdash;the
upright and able advocate of conservative institutions,
he could but assure that House that
he (Sir Jasper) took no umbrage at the comparison.
If, on the other hand, he was likened
to the Sir Robert No. 2&mdash;the ardent and
consistent promoter, through a long life, of
every liberal measure, and above all, the author
of that great principle of free trade from which

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

the United Monarchies had sprung&mdash;then he
confessed that he felt flattered by the distinction.</p>

<p>"The fact was that Providence, to further
its inscrutable designs, had raised up, at that critical
period, two men eminently fitted to meet
the wants of their century&mdash;the one to give
that impulse in the career of progress and
civilisation which had led to the fraternisation
of so many races&mdash;the other, by incessant
opposition, to act as a sort of drag on the impetuosity
of the first, steadying thereby the
progress of the nation and averting the danger
of its headlong rapidity.</p>

<p>"It so happened that they rejoiced in the
same name. Now they might compare him to
either of these remarkable characters; he
might be likened either to that Peel, the
indefatigable conservative champion, from
whose name he (Sir Jasper) was informed.
that the vulgar expression of "peeling," or
taking off the coat to fight was derived, or

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

from the great reformer Peel, whose patronymic
had equally enriched our language, <i>to
Peel</i> having become synonymous with to redress
an abuse, whence&mdash;as philologists would
readily understand&mdash;<i>re-peel</i> or <i>re-peal</i> its further
redress or abolition. He might even be compared
to both these distinguished politicians collectively,
because he dared flatter himself that
Providence had intrusted to him a mission
comprising that of both of them; but to
lump these individuals together, and compound
an imaginary inconsistency for the
purpose of saddling it on a political adversary,
exhibited either an assurance more unblushing,
or an ignorance more profound than he would
have dared to charge on any political opponent.</p>

<p>"He had but one word more to say&mdash;if there
had been any point in the allusion which he
had just dissected&mdash;what could there possibly
be in common between a period comparatively
barbarous and our own&mdash;a period in which

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

every reform threatened the fundamental laws
of society, and perilled the sacred rights of
property, and our civilised era in which even
the greatest changes&mdash;rendered necessary by
the spirit of the time&mdash;tended only to their
confirmation; for he took this opportunity of
reminding honourable gentlemen that the solemn
recognition of the inviolability of these rights
would accompany the measure submitted to
their notice."</p>

<p>This announcement of Sir Jasper was received
with loud cheers by every one but
Invective Rabid, and his partisans, for though
having abandoned Middleman Cautious to side
with the now more liberal minister, he felt
galled at the implied assurance that the interests
of the monied classes would still be in
principle alone considered.</p>

<p>Besides this, since Lord Lofty had broken
the ice for him, the democratic leader habitually indulged in extemporaneous rejoinder
and reply.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

<p>"Invective Rabid had no intention," he said
"of disputing the view taken of Sir Robert
Peel's character by the ministerial leader;
but whilst on the one hand it appeared to him
that the individual who had been one or many
times wrong, and who had one or many times
acknowledged it, was undeniably preferable to
the man who had never come to a sense of
his error&mdash;on the other he must join issue with
Sir Jasper, both as to his etymology and his
facts. He was credibly informed&mdash;and he, too,
had spoken from authority&mdash;an authority which
he had consulted, he believed, in the same manner
as the two learned speakers&mdash;for the occasion&mdash;that
the true derivation of the word <i>repeal</i> was
wholly different from that attributed to it by
Niebuhr St. Thomas, who, if he only outlived
Sir Jasper, would some day bamboozle the world
into the belief that that minister himself had
been a fictitious character.</p>

<p>"<i>Re-peel</i>, or <i>re-peal</i>, as his informant proved,
was actually derived from the proper name of

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

Peel, as borne by that political celebrity, Sir
Robert.</p>

<p>" 'To peel' in the first instance meant to
change opinions from black to white, or in
vulgar phraseology to 'turn one's coat,' and in
thus far the honourable member who had just
sat down was, no doubt, correct in supposing
the slang term which describes the preparation
for a pugilistic encounter, 'to peel, or take
off the coat,' to have had the same derivation,
since it is quite clear that every man must
take off his coat before he can turn it.</p>

<p>"Now to <i>re</i>-peel or <i>re</i> obviously meant
to repeat such change just as we say to <i>re</i>-heat
or to <i>re</i>-call. Thus probably Sir Robert
was popularly said to have <i>peeled</i> the Catholic
disabilities, that is to say to have abolished
them through the intermedium of a monstrous
dereliction of his personal opinions.</p>

<p>"When about, by a like process, to abolish the
restrictions upon corn, and to rescind the Union
of Ireland with Great Britain, it was natural

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

to apply to this act the epithet of <i>re</i>-pealing
or <i>peeling</i> again. And this conjecture is triumphantly
confirmed by the fact that the chief
liberal measure passed by his opponents, in
1832, the abolition of abuses in the representation
is never designated a <i>repeal</i> but mentioned
as a <i>reform</i>.</p>

<p>"He (Invective Rabid) had dwelt on the
derivation of this word because it appeared to
him to furnish proof of the unity of the individual
to whom Sir Jasper had been compared,
and whose example, if that unity were established,
would, he trusted, encourage him in
a career which might prove conducive to
the liberties and well-being of those masses,
whose interests he seemed ashamed of
having forwarded by the present measure&mdash;and
whose condition, he (Invective Rabid)
contended to be in the midst of the boasted
progress of our civilisation worse a thousand
fold than at the period to which the honourable
gentleman had alluded so contemptuously.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

<p>"Sir Jasper replied, 'That the subject of
the present debate proved that he was not indifferent
to the well-being of the masses, but
that whilst not only in word but deed, making
manifest his wish to serve the interests of
those to whom the possession of property
has been denied, and whose lot it was to
labour, he owed to the community at large,
he owed to those who had entrusted him
with their confidence, and above all he owed
to the labouring classes themselves the declaration
that he did not intend now to
advocate, or at any subsequent period to
support any measure ostensibly devised for
their welfare at the expense of the security of
property, its just privileges and paramount influence,
because convinced that such a step
would prove in the end alike hurtful to those
possessing wealth, and to those without it, and
though he had denounced as idle the attempt
to argue a present and practical question
through reference to a remote and uncertain

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

past, yet as the honourable gentlemen opposite
had chosen to take up that ground, and as a
casual but public spirited supporter had chosen
to argue on it, to that past he (Sir Jasper)
would refer, to show&mdash;whatever might be thought
of the present condition of the masses&mdash;how
much more grievous was their particular state,
how insecure the liberties of the whole community
in those vaunted times of fitful popular
concession.</p>

<p>"He would draw, always from irrefragable
documents, a brief picture of the state of the
British Empire from 1840 up to the famous
Repeal of the Corn Law.</p>

<p>"From this evidence he was prepared to
show that about the period in question, the
lower orders in England were driven to
eat the rotten marrow of bones destined to
manure the broad lands of the rich. That
mothers poisoned their own children to secure
the burial fees.</p>

<p>"That in Ireland the peasantry by tens of

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

thousands, impelled by famine, rushed upon
the bullet and the bayonet in search of
bread.</p>

<p>"That gentry and even royalty spent its
substance in pampering fat pigs instead of
fattening lean paupers.</p>

<p>"That the Parliament of Great Britain
was so capriciously despotic, that when it met
its fate at the hands of Doctor Reid it perished
unpitied by the world at large, to say
nothing of the premier's sentiments, who would
have been in the minority on the morrow.
That the Parliament of that period, or the
ministers which it upheld, condemned the
three popular patriots of Ireland, England,
and America, to death, imprisonment, or
exile.</p>

<p>"That Ireland's young hero and martyr,
O'Brien Smith, was kept savagely confined
in the cellars of the edifice in which the
House was sitting, and at the risk of rousing
in a body the eight hundred thousand

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

Smiths then (according to McCulloch) inhabiting
Great Britain, and who, some years
after, espousing the quarrel of the fair Penelope
their namesake overran and settled the kingdom
of the two Sicilies.</p>

<p>"That Frost, the chartist, was kept in
penal slavery for the same offence as it forgave
in the death-doomed Papineau, whether to
reward him for having escaped beyond the
reach of law and parliament, or because of
the moral distinction which locality makes in
treason, he, Sir Jasper, could no where discover
in the records to which he was referring."</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">A POLITICAL EVENT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was known that notwithstanding all opposition,
the bill brought in by Sir Jasper would
pass by an immense majority, and the chief
partisans of old Cash ranged on the Ministerial
benches, had already expressed opinions in
favour of that measure.</p>

<p>Nothing was now required to render formal
the triumph of Sir Jasper, but that the votes
of the federative assembly should be finally
recorded.</p>

<p>In anticipation of this event rejoicings on

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

an extensive scale had been prepared, and to
celebrate it the Lady of the Premier had that
evening invited his chief supporters.</p>

<p>As these were yet in the house, the room
was filled, with few exceptions, by their wives
and daughters, amongst whom the Ladies Sabina,
Floranthe, and Calliro&euml; occupied a prominent
position.</p>

<p>Each moved the centre of a circle, entirely
eclipsing the Lady of the Minister, who, but
for her station as his wife, would have passed
in unobtrusive insignificance through life in
the same manner that, without the profusion
of her diamonds, she might have remained unnoticed
amongst the brilliant guests she was
entertaining.</p>

<p>The lady of Sir Jasper, though perfectly
high bred and dignified, shrank in the indolence
of her nature from the duties imposed
upon her by her husband's guests. She was
so apathetic in disposition&mdash;so deficient in
mind, and so diffident of her own intellect,

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

that she habitually deferred to the Minister,
and would have made, what he esteemed an
admirable wife, if she had not been tormented
into doubt of the salvation of herself and
Lord by an elder sister&mdash;a lady whose ill health
(she was dying five-and-twenty years ago)
and vast fortune had not a little influenced
the choice made by the Premier of her unportioned
sister.</p>

<p>This elder sister, who had been a quarter of
a century expiring, without having yet accomplished
that feat, imagined herself, as some
one has defined it, "pious when she was only
bilious." The wealth at her disposal gave her
a very painful control over the domestic
comfort of Sir Jasper through the agency of
his wife's peace of mind, which she disturbed
with persevering industry.</p>

<p>She had insisted on bringing up the
adoptive niece of Sir Jasper, and this
young lady, after several years' residence
with her elder aunt, had been returned

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

on the hands of the Minister's lady, with the
strictest injunctions that she should carefully
be made "to walk in the way of the Lord."</p>

<p>In the exultation of her heart, when removed
from the restraint imposed upon her by
the ascetic glances of her late monitress, the
first request made by this damsel of Sir Jasper's
lady was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear aunt, <i>do</i> send to the library for an
<i>improper</i> book."</p>

<p>Such a charge had not a little contributed
to harass the hostess, and her attention was so
thoroughly absorbed in efforts to bridle this
young lady's exuberant flow of spirits, that
even upon that evening, dedicated to her husband's
triumph, she scarcely played more than
a secondary part in her own drawing-room.</p>

<p>On this occasion the two arbitresses of fashion
had already, in a marked manner, withdrawn
their countenance from the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>The Lady Sabina was reserved, the Lady
Floranthe slightly satirical in her reception of
Lord Lofty's daughter.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; had, from the first,
proudly rejected all affectation of sympathy
for the sacrifice she had made; she had identified
herself with her new family, and instead
of shrinking from the ridicule of their absurdity,
had boldly faced it with an ostentation
of their power; but keenly sensitive to
any slight, she had haughtily resented these
first signs of hostility.</p>

<p>Her self-possession was not even shaken, as
the Lady Floranthe had calculated it would
be, when her cousin Julian&mdash;the governor-general
of Japan&mdash;made his appearance, though
it was the first time they had met since her
marriage.</p>

<p>It was not without some embarrassment
that Julian accosted her; but though conscious
that, to secure his present brilliant position, he
had too abruptly yielded up her hand, his
vanity had suffered at the sacrifice she had
made, and was still further piqued to find
her now apparently so tranquil.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; remained too apparently
unmoved, even though an undefinable sensation
of pain shot through her heart when the
young governor-general joined the Lady Floranthe's
circle, and became pointedly demonstrative
in his admiration of her.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, a tone of anxious
expectation, like that which may be noticed in
a breathless audience when the curtain is about
to rise for the last act of a deeply interesting
drama, pervaded the whole assembly. If it
was disturbed by the union of two former
rivals&mdash;by the obvious schism now dividing
them from the new aspirant whom they had so
lately been caressing, or by the flirtation between
Julian and the Lady Floranthe, this
was only the bye play of the boxes which gradually
ceased as the denouement of the piece
drew near. The general interest grew gradually
more absorbing as the hour approached,
which it had been judged would be decisive;
and the first member who abandoned his post

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

to bring intelligence of the progress of the
debate, appeared welcome as the dove to the
inmates of the ark.</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe could not, for one moment,
monopolise him, and though he had come in
her honour, the guests of the premier's lady
would not wait to have the intelligence he
brought interpreted even through her lips.</p>

<p>Though all were convinced beforehand of the
result of their enquiries&mdash;though the solution
of the political problem that evening was certain;
and though the manner of its solution
was past doubt&mdash;still the parliamentary truant
was overwhelmed with questions spoken almost
in a breath.</p>

<p>It was true, that even though virtually decided,
there was still an imposing solemnity
about the act which was to overturn the long
ascendancy of the wealthy oligarchy, scattering
the elements from which each party hoped to
construct a political edifice suited to its
views.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

<p>In reply to these questions, the member made
answer,</p>

<p>"That in consequence of unavoidable delay, the
votes of the House had not yet been taken, but
that when he left, John Cash, whose speech it
was understood would wind up the debate,
was on his legs&mdash;that he had commenced his
speech by avowing himself (as every one expected)
in favour of the proposed measure.
From these data they might judge how long
it would be before the great bill which would
immortalise Sir Jasper, would become the law
of the United Monarchies; and, in fact, this
event would be instantaneously announced to
them by the roar of cannon, for on all the surrounding
heights&mdash;on the Montmartre and the
Montrouge, the gunners were waiting now with
lighted match."</p>

<p>Then followed congratulations to the premier's
lady, conjecture as to the amount of the majority,
and then another lengthened interval of
silent suspense. The guests began to range

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

themselves to receive the triumphant minister,
but still the cannon was silent.</p>

<p>At length, the outer door opened&mdash;no announcement
was made, but a step too hurried
and heavy to be that of the well&mdash;trained attendants,
traversed the ante-room, and Sir Jasper
himself burst in amongst them.</p>

<p>He was deadly pale; his eyes were haggard&mdash;his
knees bent under him, and he directed his
steps hither and thither, like one confused and
giddy, amongst the astonished crowd whom he
pushed aside with his arm.</p>

<p>At length, he flung himself upon an ottoman,
and compressing his brow with his palms
as if to contain the distending brain&mdash;uttered incoherent
sounds, and groaned aloud&mdash;a pitiable
spectacle.</p>

<p>Was the minister seized with sudden illness?
had the mind given way, and was he stricken
by a terrible aberration of intellect in the very
hour of triumph? All was confusion in a moment&mdash;some
ran to summon the family physician&mdash;some

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

deluged him with refreshing perfumes,
whilst fair hands supported him and felt his
pulse enquiringly, and chafed his throbbing
temples.</p>

<p>His terrified wife exclaiming "that he was
a sinful creature, that we were sinful creatures
all," fell down upon her knees and prayed
aloud.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper still only muttered unintelligible
sounds, and glared vacantly around him.</p>

<p>This scene had not occupied three minutes
when Eustatius Cash and Lord Lofty made
their appearance quite as unceremoniously.
Both were deeply agitated&mdash;both were pale&mdash;and
the lip of the senator quivered so as to
impede his utterance.</p>

<p>"We have no hand, no participation in
this," he exclaimed at length, appealing, as it
were, from the insensible minister to his lady
still upon her knees, and then in bewilderment
to the astounding group surrounding them.

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

"Our faith&mdash;our inviolable faith is plighted to
our leader."</p>

<p>"Against all&mdash;and every one," said Eustatius,
seizing his wife's hand, "come, Calliro&euml;,
let us exonerate ourselves, and declare our
fidelity to Sir Jasper."</p>

<p>"No," said the Lady Calliro&euml;, coldly,
"why should I use deceit?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the husband, "do
you know what has taken place?"</p>

<p>"I can surmise, I was forewarned" said the
Lady Calliro&euml;, "and I know that it is unmeet
that we should trespass farther on the
hospitality of Sir Jasper's lady."</p>

<p>"Stay," whispered the husband, "you will
ruin our position if we do not disconnect ourselves
from this rashness."</p>

<p>"Will you call my carriage?" replied the
wife aloud, composedly to a by-stander.</p>

<p>"My child," whispered Lord Lofty, eagerly,
"I implore you, do not retire."</p>

<p>"It would not be decent for me to remain."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

<p>"Not with your father?"</p>

<p>"You have given me another family."</p>

<p>"But your husband commands."</p>

<p>"I obey his injunction who commands my
husband."</p>

<p>"What has happened," asked the Lady
Floranthe, for the third time, of one of the
partisans of Sir Jasper, who were now crowding in.</p>

<p>"An event&mdash;the most strange&mdash;the most
unaccountable&mdash;a treachery the most perfidious&mdash;the
bill is lost by a large majority. John
Cash has opposed it."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the first member who
was introduced to the attention of the reader.
"I saw him on his legs, and I heard him express
his full concurrence in the expediency
and justice of its principle."</p>

<p>"He did," replied the last speaker, "with
his quaint, plain, vulgar, hard-spoken rhetoric,
he gave us fresh and indisputable reasons why
it should be passed; he brought forth startling

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

facts respecting the progress of the scarcity
and showed the necessity of disposing of the
agitation occasioned by the question before the
house, to be enabled to meet and provide for
that emergency. There was no doubt he said
that the present law must be repealed&mdash;it
would be repealed before another week went
over their heads, as sure as God made little
apples. He was pledged together with those
who reposed confidence in him to aid in its
abolition, but he thought that they would
agree with him that it was fraught with danger
if introduced under the auspices of one who
having once turned coat and broken faith with
his order could not be trusted by men of
capital. He would not confide in him for one.
He was pledged, and so were those with him
to support the bill, but not to do so that night,
and he should vote against it, now and at all
times when introduced by Sir Jasper, towards
whom he entertained the most friendly personal
feeling, but whom, politically speaking,

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

he would not trust the length of his foot. As
for the bill, he had as large a stake as any
body in the state, he should be glad himself
to introduce it, but that night he opposed it,
with this reservation that he at the same time
begged the House to understand his objection
to be directed not against the measure
but against the man. Nothing could exceed
the uproar occasioned by this announcement,
but startled as they were, the followers of
Cash voted with him to a man, the party
of Middleman Cautious made common cause
with him, and worst and most fatal, a large
number of the magnates seem disposed to
take part against Sir Jasper, and to see in old
Cash the true Conservative."</p>

<p>"How has my lord voted?" asked the Lady
Sabina, inwardly prepared to blame him either
way.</p>

<p>"He did not vote at all," replied the member,
"but you see that it is thus war to the
knife. Sir Jasper&mdash;poor Sir Jasper&mdash;must

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

rally to-morrow, or old Cash must become&mdash;it
may sound strange&mdash;but by Heavens! he
must become himself the Premier of the
United Monarchies."</p>

<p>"Old Cash, the rag and bottle-merchant,
Premier!" said the Lady Floranthe with a
laugh began in natural mirth, and concluding
in a forced termination.</p>

<p>At this moment the Lady Calliro&euml; made a
dignified courtesy to the wife of the minister,
who now having risen, though still bewildered,
replied,</p>

<p>"We are all miserable sinners, but indeed
I have slipped tracts into all his papers and dispatches."</p>

<p>The daughter-in-law of the millionary
then, leaving her father and her husband in attendance on Sir Jasper, made her way through
the company to the door, bowing haughtily to
the Ladies Sabina and Floranthe, the latter of
whom said ironically,</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Calliro&euml;, the daughter of the

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

Minister that is to be will not refuse us her
protection!"</p>

<p>"You at all times command me as you may
would a daughter," and with this reply so cutting
to the juvenile pretensions of the Lady
Floranthe, she moved onwards.</p>

<p>Seeing her alone her cousin Julian flew to
offer her his hand according to the respectful
ceremonial of that day.</p>

<p>"No," said the Lady Calliro&euml;, "to the rejection
of my hand, you owe your present
office, do not now peril your governor-generalship
by proffering me yours, for Sir Jasper is
still Minister to-night, and he may yet be so
the whole day to-morrow."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">BENEVOLENCE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was night-fall when a man, wrapped in a
cloak, rung at one of the bells of a private building,
whose light and unprisonlike architecture
contrasted strangely with its heavily barred
windows.</p>

<p>Over the porch of this edifice, on a small
marble slab, its destination was recorded in
unostentatious characters.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">hospital for the reception of insane
patients. founded a. d. 1880, by voluntary
and anonymous contributions.</span>"</p>

<p>This individual was of middle age and powerful

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

stature. His head was large, his features
prominent, and, at first glance, seemingly
weather-beaten, but, on close inspection, rather
scarred and swollen by the habitual distortion
of intemperance and passion. Their expression
bespoke a boastful hardihood and recklessness
mixed up with a certain amount of vindictiveness
and cunning, relieved by an occasional
dash of frankness and good-nature. To the
eye of the physiognomist they might have
seemed to denote a nature, whose gross sensuality
was incessantly struggling with its intellectual
tendencies, and a mere creature of impulse
probably for good or evil exactly what circumstance
had made him.</p>

<p>He was about to pass by the attendant who
admitted him as one accustomed to the ways
of the place, when he stumbled on the principal
of the establishment, whose reception of
him was at once cordial and respectful.</p>

<p>"What, come as usual to see my patient?"</p>

<p>"I would not willingly miss seeing him for

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

a day. His case deeply interests me; do you
still think it to be a bad one?"</p>

<p>"Incurable," replied the principal with a
grave shake of the head, "but he is more
tractable I am told since you have kindly
taken him in hand."</p>

<p>"I am not quite disinterested," said the
stranger. "He is an admirable numismatist.
I amuse my leisure by collecting coins, and
the employment which diverts the thoughts
of the poor youth from his mania, is of the
greatest utility to me in my pursuit."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the principal, an easy good-humored
man. "I have been a collector too,
sir, in my time&mdash;a conchologist&mdash;but one day I
was introduced to a brother-collector, who invited
me to visit his 'cabinet.' It was a very
extensive one, fitted with thirteen hundred
little mahogany drawers, each labelled with
forty Greek names, and divided into as many
compartments. They were filled with horse-chesnuts
picked up during half a century by

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

the old gentleman in the gardens of the
Tuilleries, and classified according to their peculiar
grain into fifty-two thousand distinct
varieties. I went home in profound disgust
and threw my shells out of window, vowing
never in future to collect anything but wines&mdash;will
you be tempted now, sir, to try with
how much judgment?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, my worthy friend, time
presses, I must not disappoint my <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;;</i> will
you be good enough to order that I have at
all times access to him."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied the principal, "I
am proud to make the exception in your favour.
Though it <i>is</i> against general orders&mdash;I am
sure that your benevolent hobby could give
nothing but satisfaction to the chief&mdash;or really
for ought I know, the sole contributor to this
institution."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you will singularly oblige me
by not acquainting him with the matter; I
have reasons for it."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

<p>"You shall be obeyed. I understand you
sir&mdash;political differences&mdash;unwillingness to interfere
with the secret charities of an opponent.
Why sir, people say we live in an age of
iron; but there is more benevolence in the
world than it gives itself credit for. How beautiful
is the unassuming charity which anonymously
supports this establishment&mdash;how easily
and comfortably its whole machinery works in
the absence of prying contributors, who on
the strength of a trumpery subscription meddle
inquisitively with everything&mdash;and how very
touching it is to know that under the rose, two
men opposed to each other in those politics
which are supposed to absorb all their attention,
devote their substance or their time to
further the laudable objects of this institution."</p>

<p>"And how fortunate that they should
have so discreet and valuable a coadjutor as
yourself. But I must go to my Numismatist.
Good night, Doctor."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

<p>The stranger, no other than the politician
of the <i>Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es</i> was ushered into an
apartment in which a youth was seated writing.
That youth was Tempest, who rose to
give him welcome.</p>

<p>"I am almost prepared for you."</p>

<p>"Already!" said the stranger, glancing
with surprise at the papers handed to him.</p>

<p>"I have worked without intermission since
yesterday," replied Tempest, "when my attendant
was satisfied that I had retired to rest,
I rose again to my task."</p>

<p>Without a word the stranger sat down and
carefully ran through the documents. Here
and there his eye brightened, and sometimes
an expression of assent or admiration seemed
to burst involuntarily from him; when he had
concluded he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have nobly redeemed your pledge.
This is truly a wonderful production, as powerful
as marvellously rapid. At least," he
continued, modifying the first enthusiasm of

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

his praise, "these notes contain thoughts and
passages which, judiciously selected and
adapted, ought be turned to great account.
Unhappily I come to announce to you a startling
fact, which reduces all this to inutility.
Sir Jasper has succumbed, and John Cash is
this day Premier of the United Monarchies."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Tempest calmly. "I am
not surprised. Did not I tell you that he
might possibly become the master of the
world? Did not I tell you that the interests
of humanity were identified with mine against
him?" And then taking the papers he tore
into shreds, the fruits of his labours, observing
quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"But in that case these have been lost time;
we must begin again."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">A FRIEND IN NEED.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tempest</span> after being rather identified than
examined, had been removed to a lunatic
asylum.</p>

<p>He had been asked, for form sake, by a grave
doctor, a few questions, to which, mad or sane
it would have been difficult for him to have
given satisfactory answers, seeing that they related
to the topography of Paris, with which
he had never been acquainted.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

<p>In all the vigour of youth, and in all the consciousness
of mental superiority, he had been
unable to devise any means even to disprove the
intellectual deficiency attributed to him. The
account he had given of himself and of the malicious
motive which had led to his incarceration, had
only served to confirm the impression of his mania;
and this impression was further strengthened
by the peculiar wildness of glance and
fervency of speech derived from the solitary life
he had led and the exhausting practice of mesmeric
abstraction.</p>

<p>Conceiving that he was the victim of the
same persecution which had broken the spirit
of his master and preceptor, he judged that
the measures of Old Cash had been too skilfully
taken to contend with.</p>

<p>He resigned himself therefore, apparently,
to his fate; deeply dejected indeed at the
nature of this first obstacle to his career, and
at the delay it must involve, but resolved to

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

overcome and confident of triumphing over
it. He did not underrate, because he knew
from the experience of his departed friend the
baneful influence of coercion, solitude, and
the contagion of insanity, but to battle with
it he felt within himself a persevering energy
which time could not subdue, and which danger
and difficulty could but augment.</p>

<p>He soon gathered that the establishment in
which he was confined had been chiefly supported
by the munificent charity of Old Cash,
"whose unostentatious benevolence," he was
informed, "had led him, many years before,
privately to contribute to its first institution
and subsequent prosperity."</p>

<p>He also elicited that he had been introduced
there by this personage, as patron of the asylum,
with a certification by the highest medical authority
of the incurable nature of his malady, and the
accompanying remark, that the mental alienation
from which he suffered was hereditary in

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

its nature, and, in this respect, dangerous and
worthy of the solicitude of the authorities,
that the hallucination of the youth threatened
the existence of the founder of that establishment.</p>

<p>Hence, though no unnecessary restraint was
employed, the utmost vigilance was exercised
as regarded the custody of his person; and
Tempest saw no immediate prospect of escape
from these walls, in which he doubted not that,
under a pretext equally insidious, the spirit of
the old man whose disciple he was, had been
effectually broken. And, in fact, escape from
that building, difficult as it was, would only
have been one step towards freedom&mdash;when
the facilities at the disposal of his persecutor&mdash;the
hue and cry, the electric telegraph, and
the police&mdash;were taken into consideration.</p>

<p>He was kept usually in solitude; but books
and even scientific apparatus were allowed him,
and exercise, under the eye of a guardian, in a
garden so carefully enclosed that any attempt

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

to approach its walls, could immediately be detected
by the vibration of unseen wires sounding
a tocsin in the centre of the building.</p>

<p>Chance had, however raised up a friend to
the forlorn.</p>

<p>The stranger, who had witnessed the apprehension
of Tempest, determined not to lose
sight of him, without learning something
further about his case, which he readily devised
the means of doing, when acquainted
with the place of seclusion to which he had
been conveyed.</p>

<p>It so happened that the superintendent of
the establishment in question had formerly
been under deep obligations to him, and hence,
being wholly ignorant of any political motive
for the detention of his patient, saw no reason
to refuse his visitor access to him.</p>

<p>A brief conversation sufficed to persuade the
stranger of the <i>Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es</i> that&mdash;according
to his first suspicion&mdash;the mind of Tempest had
no taint of that insanity which those who deal

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

professionally with it are so apt to imagine
where it does not exist, in the same manner
as men whose avocation leads them into conversation
with guilt, are prone to see a
criminal in every man whose innocence is
not presumptive, from his known antecedents.
Shrewd, bold, plain spoken, and avowedly
delighting in the detection of a grievance, it
would have been difficult to have chosen a
more eager advocate than the stranger; and
persuaded that Tempest was the victim of
some machination, which he might fling with
startling effect in the teeth of those in the
high places of the State, he took leave of the
captive, with the assurance that, corrupt as
society had become, he would find means to see
justice done him.</p>

<p>The morrow passed, and he did not come
according to promise, but on the third day had
again made his appearance.</p>

<p>On this occasion, though equally confident,

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

because the tribune and the press were indirectly
open to him, he dwelt on the necessity
of energy and prudence, and proposed that
Tempest should set forth his own case.</p>

<p>After an interview of several hours' duration,
he took his leave, sincerely bent on the
exposure of this act of oppression; but as he
came to reflect on the singular ability of his
client, the thought suggested itself, that&mdash;fashioned
by the tact of his own experienced
hand&mdash;the versatile talent and rare knowledge
of the imprisoned youth might be applied to
purposes more general, and at any rate more
interesting&mdash;than the vindication of an individual
wrong by Tempest's liberation&mdash;to him
who had undertaken to effect it.</p>

<p>There was, however, some truth in his allegation
when next they met, that circumstances
had taken place which had singularly changed
the position of old Cash, and rendered more
difficult the enlargement of his victim; but
the plan which he proposed, of gradually assailing

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

the Colossus preparatory to calling him
to account for this act of oppression, originated
in the wish to further his personal and
party views, through the instrumentality of
Tempest's genius.</p>

<p>It may be readily understood how eagerly
Tempest undertook to devote the hours of his
solitude to an occupation which, whilst conducive
to his liberation, involved hostility to
the great rival with whom he believed it was
his destiny to struggle on the behalf of humanity
and human progress.</p>

<p>It was equally true that when in the direction
indicated to him the prisoner tried his
powers, his efforts were not available without
modification and adaptation. Junius resuscitated
from that <i>terra incognita</i> in which his
ashes moulder, to take a part in the politics of
a succeeding century, would not have been
more liable to sin against its conventionalities
of sentiment as well as form; but the insight
which Tempest rapidly acquired into the present,

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

soon placed him in this respect on a
level with his contemporaries, whilst at the
same time the freshness of his style called attention
to the boldness of his views and the
depth and originality of his thought.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">MYRRAH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is an hour past midnight, and Myrrah
thrones in the midst of her adorers.</p>

<p>Still in the zenith of her beauty and celebrity
there lives no woman of whom fame
has spoken so much, so variedly, and yet so
truly. Truly, because her conduct has been
a tissue of contradictions. There are but three
points&mdash;her charms, her talents, and her levity&mdash;on
which report is agreed, and of these
without dissent, she is considered far and wide
the living impersonation.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 246 -->

<p>Her figure is tall and ample enough to
give her aspect dignity, without detracting
from its grace or lightness. She has a bosom
fair, full, and marble-like, as that on which
the Cleopatra of sculptors and of painters
feeds the asp, a waist unclassically small,
which the hands might span, and alternately&mdash;according
as she chooses to be playful or majestic&mdash;the
port of an Empress, or the step of
an aerial nymph.</p>

<p>Her profile, like her name, is Greek, but
relieved by her Circassian eye-brows and long
lashes from that heaviness which, notwithstanding
all their purity, so often stamps the
lineaments of antique beauty.</p>

<p>The long, soft tresses of her raven locks,
bound by a wreath of golden ivy, descend in
almost fabulous profusion upon her beautifully
rounded shoulders. Her lip seems to breathe
perfume. Her dark eye, in its ever-changing
expression, sparkles with merriment, or
lightens with irony. Now, it subdues its fire

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

into a glance of exquisitely languid softness,
and now it wakens to a flash of passion or of
anger ideally intense. Her voice is more
flexibly expressive than her features.</p>

<p>There is no sound which its modulation
cannot compass, and no sensation to be conveyed
by sound which it cannot impart.</p>

<p>She is arrayed in a robe of deep garnet-coloured
velvet, girt at the waist by a mosaic
zone of precious stones, ingeniously wrought
into the semblance of a serpent, whilst her
wrists are encircled by bracelets which correspond
in all but their predominant tint. She
is surrounded, too, by the most dazzling colours,
the most gorgeous stuffs, and by a profusion
of gilding, light, and brilliancy, such as even
the wife of the millionary can hardly match,
but then her unerring taste has taken pride
in blending into harmony, hues which
no other could venture to combine, even
as the sun-rays and the cloud mingle
their glaring yellow, bright scarlet, and

<!-- vol 2 page 248 -->

deep purple into splendour, without gaudiness.</p>

<p>In a word, though both her person and
everything around her is voluptuous and
warm, there is nothing meretricious in either,
and even as with a bold glance and glowing
cheek, she reclines at the head of her board,
pledging her guests from the sparkling goblet
she recalls rather the Divinity than the
Courtesan.</p>

<p>These guests, few in number and select in
choice, are all present, or former admirers, for
Myrrah is a privileged person in whom everything
is forgiven, and whose notice is esteemed
as a signal honour, even by those who affect
to apologise for resorting to her entertainments.</p>

<p>None but personages eminently distinguished
by their rank, fame, or talents, are admitted
to convivial intercourse with the sorceress who
has at one time or other disturbed the heads
of one-half of the public of the United Monarchies,

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

and employed the tongues of the
remainder.</p>

<p>Amongst the company that night assembled,
consisting of about twenty individuals of the
male sex, may be distinguished her former favourite, 
the young governor-general of Japan,
who has come to gamble away his twelve
months' salary by anticipation. Next to him
is a very grave professor, chairman of the
committee for enquiring into the corn-murrain,
and who cuts as great a figure in the scientific
as Julian in the fashionable world. On the
left hand of Myrrah, sits the ubiquitous Lord
Besom, a good deal dejected, because, after
having so long plumed himself on being
in advance of his century, he begins to
suspect himself to be, after all, behind the
spirit of his time. Bilious by temperament,
and contradictious by nature&mdash;it is
has been his pride to enlist under one political
banner, and vote, argue and associate
with the followers of another,

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

but now he can no longer keep pace with
the recent changes of party, which provokingly
render him in spite of himself,
consistent.</p>

<p>Beside Lord Besom, sits the husband of the
Lady Floranthe, a middle aged personage,
pale, sickly, youthful-looking, for his years, and
upon whose inane features, the traces
of long and exhausting dissipation are apparent.</p>

<p>Like two other of Myrrah's guests, his claim
to the distinction of a seat at that table is
not personal.</p>

<p>The spouse of the stately Lady Sabina, plebeian
in aspect, dwarfish as a Spanish grandee,
and yet of a stature more exalted than his intellect,
is of that company, together with
Eustatius Cash&mdash;who now, having quarrelled
with his father, has nothing to recommend
him.</p>

<p>Indeed, the actress has spared no pains to
attract this trio to those renowned entertainments

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

to which all the world are struggling for admission,
where the versatile genius of this extraordinary
woman joyously and spontaneously
developed, constitutes both the attraction of
grave and gay, and their apology&mdash;where men of
the most contradictory prospects and views,
whose avocations and opinions, forbid elsewhere
all social converse, may meet and
mingle, and where, by tacit consent, all that
passes&mdash;unless the names of the favoured few&mdash;remains
as inviolably secret, as the mysterious
transactions of a masonic lodge.</p>

<p>Myrrah, in fact, considers the presence of
these men at her banquets, as necessary to her
triumph as the Roman conquerors, the display
of vanquished kings and captive queens to the
eyes of the Roman people, because she loves
to feast her vanity upon the homage of these
husbands whose neglected wives rule by their
rank, wit, or beauty in a sphere from which she
is excluded.</p>

<p>There is one more personage with whom

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

the reader is acquainted&mdash;not least, though last,
because, at this moment, known to occupy the
chief place in the good graces of the hostess.
It is Invective Rabid, whose overbearing
manner, rude and impetuous speech, and repulsively
coarse physiognomy, have once been both
a motive of exclusion and the object of her
remark and satire.</p>

<p>But Invective Rabid, both by the decline of
the importance of his rivals, and by the sudden
development of unsuspected powers, has recently
risen from the position of a noisy demagogue,
to that of a powerful political leader
in the public estimation; and&mdash;at least, in
that of the capricious Myrrah,&mdash;has almost, at
a step, progressed from the contemptuous
indifference, which he formerly inspired to the
enthusiastic admiration which she now professes
for him.</p>

<p>"I have now," said Myrrah, "a question to
ask you all; but more particularly of you, my
lord Besom, who are always on the right side,

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

or, at least, on the winning side in politics;
and of you, my friend, Eustatius, who are always
on the wrong."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> upon the winning side!" exclaimed the
ex-chancellor.</p>

<p>"I know you pique yourself upon the contrary.
We all disclaim our weaknesses," continued
Myrrah, "but when so distinguished a
Moderate transfers his intimacy first to Sir
Jasper, and then to John Cash, this transition
of the affections does look like an instinctive
predilection for the uppermost. As for Eustatius,
he has shown much commendable acquiescence
with the neutral policy of his respected
sire, when he might have made his own
terms, by pronouncing for Sir Jasper, and he
has quarrelled with the venerated author of his
existence at the very moment that the old gentleman
has become premier."</p>

<p>"But what change is this?" asked Lord
Besom; "how comes it, Myrrah, that you occupy
yourself with politics?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 254 -->

<p>"Not I, but politics have altered," replied
Myrrah; "prosaic as they were, I abhorred
them; but now filled with eventful change,
unexpected situations, and dramatic incident,
they afford attractions greater than the stage
can offer."</p>

<p>"Do you think the conduct of political men
more wise, more dignified, or more consistent
than it used to be?" asked the professor.</p>

<p>"No; but more amusing," answered Myrrah.
"I would rather see a vaudeville or a ballet,
or sing in a new opera, than listen to the
stream of sapience which flows from your
learned lips, when you lecture on the corn
murrain. I prefer, without hesitation, the
diverting simulation to the prosy reality: but
reverse the case; stand forward to the world
as a dancer on the tight-rope&mdash;and I fly from
the dull delusion to the entertaining truth."</p>

<p>A general laugh followed this conceit, which
conjured up the irresistibly ludicrous image

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

of the grave professor in flesh coloured tights
following the avocation of the tumbler.</p>

<p>"But your question, beautiful Myrrah."</p>

<p>"I was about to ask," said Myrrah, "whether
any one could tell me in whose hand the helm
of state would be this day month."</p>

<p>"Why?" said the ex-chancellor. "Do you
mean to turn courtier as well as politician?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Myrrah, raising her goblet,
"I addressed myself to you and to Eustatius
as to the two opposite points of a weathercock,
one of which shows whence the wind <i>does</i>,
the other whence it <i>does not</i> blow. I wish
the name of the future premier, to pour this
libation in his honour."</p>

<p>"Who shall dare venture to say&mdash;who will
answer for a month?" said Julian, "there
have been three favourites in one week, and I
would take long odds upon the field against
any candidate you could name for the portfolio."</p>

<p>"Well," said Myrrah, "nameless then I

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

pledge him. If truth, talent, and consistency
are to triumph&mdash;and I have faith in their ascendancy&mdash;I
believe that these elements will
rise uppermost amidst the disorganisation to
which political corruption has led&mdash;then I know
who must shortly hold the reins of government,
and to this individual I drink&mdash;and call
on all my guest to drink&mdash;success."</p>

<p>"A strange pledge, most imperious, Myrrah,"
said the Lady Floranthe's husband,
"since you inevitably propose to some of us
to toast an adversary."</p>

<p>"I cry you mercy!" said Myrrah, "I had
forgotten your consistency, or do I not read
in all your looks the modest consciousness
that the description I have made can have no
personal application."</p>

<p>"And what," said Julian, "if your nameless
candidate should not become minister?
For though it is hard to determine as things
go who will not, it must be equally difficult
by the same rule to say who will."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 257 -->

<p>"I provide against such a contingency&mdash;not
by that mental reservation, through which
certain of my friends qualify their protestations
of political fidelity&mdash;but by the accompanying
stipulation that if any less deserving
than he whom I have in view should fill the
post in question, I drink not success but confusion
to him, and so long as he will not make
way for better men, hereby invoke upon
him every evil that can befall the statesman.
May he have Julian to take charge of
his finances who has gambled away his year's
salary, and who would stake his new government
if it were portable."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Julian.</p>

<p>"May he have Lord Besom for a partisan,
whom every one dreads more as a friend than
as an enemy."</p>

<p>"May he fall under the ban of Myrrah's
tongue," interrupted the ex-chancellor.</p>

<p>"Worse than that," continued Myrrah, "may
he wither in the shade of her indifference.

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

May he have Eustatius Cash for a son, who
never did a public spirited thing except to
spite his own father."</p>

<p>"You are too severe, Myrrah," said the
professor.</p>

<p>"May he have a murrain in his brain, and
the doctor to preside a committee on it&mdash;may
he have the husbands of the Ladies Sabina and
Floranthe for partisans, and may he have for
adversary, one whose patriotism has never
wavered, where all around were changing,
whose courage has never failed where all have
been false-hearted&mdash;whose dormant powers
have been roused by the greatness of the occasion,
who has gathered new faculties from his
country's peril&mdash;as a mother finds strength in
the danger of her child&mdash;and who has brought
forth in its defence, the unsuspected pathos of
the poet, the skill of the logician, the knowledge
of the man of science, the learning of
the sage&mdash;the deep insight of genius into men
and things, and the language with which heaven

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

has gifted it to innoculate the minds of
millions with its thoughts. In a word, may he
have Invective Rabid for an enemy. Such is
the toast I drink. The next time I propose one
perhaps you will follow suit my lords and gentlemen,
without calling on me for an explanation."</p>

<p>"Most perspicuous Myrrah," said Invective
Rabid, rising, "your praise would call a blush
into my cheeks, if Burgundy had not permanently
as well as prematurely coloured
them."</p>

<p>"In truth," said Myrrah, "I owed you a
reparation, for a former ill-advised judgment
on you."</p>

<p>"That reparation would have been more flattering
still," said Invective Rabid, good-humouredly;
"if unaccompanied by censure on my
fellow guests, who though political foes are united
with me at this board in good companionship."</p>

<p>"Why should I not speak what I think <i>of</i>

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

them as well as <i>to</i> them, if they thwart me,"
said Myrrah. "It was before them, that not
long since I called you a brawling demagogue&mdash;coarse
in manner, mind, and speech&mdash;with
the gait of a butcher, the voice of an ox, and
the head of a boar. There was no one to
gainsay me then, you would have thought
that the reputation of an unprotected woman,
was being torn, or that a weight calumny was
being added to the load she justly had to bear
already."</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"Now, I trace the lion's traits in your features&mdash;his
roar in your voice&mdash;his heart in your
bosom."</p>

<p>"Well, you have modified your opinion, they
have entertained the same and modified
it too."</p>

<p>"I will never incur Myrrah's wrath again,"
said Lord Besom.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> never refused to drink anything to any
man or woman living," observed Julian.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

<p>"Myrrah," said Eustatius, "in your present
vein, you seem to think us all unworthy of
your society."</p>

<p>"No, on the contrary," said Myrrah, "I
think the association most natural between a
woman without private character, and men
without public morals."</p>

<p>"You are too severe, Myrrah," said Lord
Besom, "but as submissive lieges we
bow to the chastisement without a murmur.
As for Invective Rabid, for whom your fair
hands have twined a wreath so enviable, I
think there can be no one here&mdash;whether political,
friend, or opponent&mdash;whether having
entertained an exalted or contemptible notion
of such talents as he formerly deigned to exhibit&mdash;who
has not been astounded at the new
character in which he has burst forth upon the
world. None who can deny the extent and
variety of the powers he has so long and unaccountably
suffered to lie dormant&mdash;and none

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

I trust who will not as heartily add their
tribute as I do mine to this ovation.</p>

<p>"I propose," said Julian "as an amendment
to Myrrah's toast&mdash;anathematised be he,
who bars the place of Myrrah's candidate, and
may that nameless favourite be&mdash;whomsoever
each of us inwardly thinks fittest for the
office."</p>

<p>"That is to say himself. Yourself, for instance,
Julian?" said Eustatius.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Julian, "no man can tell in
these strange times what qualifications he may
or may not possess. The example of Invective
Rabid realises the suspicion of the Hibernian
who thought it possible that he might play
the fiddle because he had never tried. Like
Invective I may find myself out to be a poet,
a philosopher, a statesman, and a man of learning.
I believe we are&mdash;or ought to be&mdash;political
opponents, but I beg leave to assure him
that except in as far as my quarter's salary

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

requires, I do not entertain any feeling&mdash;I will
not say of enmity towards him, for I have none
towards any living being&mdash;but other than
extreme good-will. The man breathes not
whose rising fame I would hail more cordially
than that of Invective Rabid. He has never
for years done aught but drain the bowl,
rattle the dice, or roar out an extemporaneous
diatribe, yet he comes out when least expected
as a most proper man, puzzling the pedant
and the statesman, and routing the man of
science and the financier."</p>

<p>"And then," said Lord Besom, "of all the
strange qualities he has brought to light, the
least suspected was his modesty. Who would
ever have expected modesty from Invective
Rabid?"</p>

<p>"His life was an exemplification of its practice,"
said Myrrah. "He concealed his powers
as the unvaunting soldier keeps his brand
in the scabbard, till the hour of battle."</p>

<p>"In truth," said Invective Rabid, who,

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

notwithstanding the brazen effrontery of his
habitual manner, received these compliments
almost with diffidence. "I am afraid I can
plead nothing but culpable idleness. A sort
of humble Brutus in my way if I have been
induced to disguise the acquirements of early
life and of my occasional leisure in a boisterous
frankness&mdash;as the Roman did his patriotism
in the garb of folly&mdash;it is because
I feared as much to task my mind and
memory, or to bore my neighbours, as he
had learned to dread the Tarquin's anger.
The occasion makes the man. His country's
danger thawed the fears of Brutus. The
people's peril has dissipated my repugnance
to exert in its service the slender faculties I
possess."</p>

<p>"All modesty is humbug," said Lord Besom
"but those faculties are not so, and I do homage
to their vast though tardy promise."</p>

<p>"If the matter were not personal," said
the professor, "without any wish to detract

<!-- vol 2 page 265 -->

from the merits of Invective Rabid I should
beg leave to protest against the ingenious sophistries
of his attack upon the theory of the
corn-murrain."</p>

<p>"And I should beg leave to observe," said
Myrrah, "that every one of his anticipations
have been realised in diametric opposition to
the opinion published by the committee."</p>

<p>"An accidental coincidence," said the
Doctor, "on such the success of empiricism has
in all times been founded."</p>

<p>"That is to say," replied Myrrah, "that
after six months' labour&mdash;after examining
sixty thousand witnesses, and after printing
one hundred and thirty thousand folio pages of
reports&mdash;your committee came to the stupendous
conclusion, 'that wheat and rye did appear
to be affected by a disease.' "</p>

<p>"And I am prepared to substantiate the
affirmation now," said the professor stoutly.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Myrrah, "why every
man, woman, and child in the United Monarchies

<!-- vol 2 page 266 -->

was aware of <i>that</i> before the committee
commenced its labours. We did not want
sixty thousand witnesses to tell us that."</p>

<p>"One cannot have too much evidence to
authenticate a fact of so great magnitude,"
replied the professor.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Myrrah, "your committee
sat for six months longer."</p>

<p>"To enquire into the pathology of the
disease."</p>

<p>"Which had altered in every feature by
the time you published it."</p>

<p>"And to specify remedies?"</p>

<p>"Yes, such as the following," said Myrrah&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remedy the first, when the symptoms appear
in the rising crop, <i>root it out</i>.</p>

<p>"Remedy the second, when it appears in the
garnered harvest, to stop the disease, thrash the
corn and <i>eat it</i>.</p>

<p>Remedy the third, where this is impracticable
or inconvenient, steep the grain in a

<!-- vol 2 page 267 -->

mixture consisting of seventy-five parts saccharine
extract of sound old wheat, fifteen
antimony, and ten sulphur. Every sixty-four
ounces of this composition will render sixteen
of any kind of grain impervious to the contagion,
or in other words, for every <i>three</i>
pounds of good grain you <i>expend</i>, you may
<i>save one</i> pound of tainted corn from further decomposition."</p>

<p>"Well," said the professor, "if not unexceptionable,
these remedies are, at least,
all efficient."</p>

<p>"And lastly," proceeded Myrrah, "the body
of wiseacres presided over by your sapience,
set forth a hundred and forty reasons why the
contagion could never spread to any other
sorts of grain, and why it was impossible that
it could ever attack the farinaceous roots. Invective
Rabid condemned these propositions
collectively and individually, and the result of
the last three weeks has shown him to have
been in every instance right."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 268 -->

<p>"To keep up the prestige of my modesty,"
said Invective Rabid. "I must confess the
simple process by which I arrived at that result.
I gathered all the opinions of the commission,
and&mdash;considering that it had invariably
been wrong&mdash;by taking their converse
secured the strongest presumption that I should
be right."</p>

<p>"This is making a buffoonery of science,"
said the irate professor.</p>

<p>"The commission has done that already,"
answered Myrrah.</p>

<p>"And yet," observed Invective, with earnestness,
when the laugh at the professor had
subsided, "Though you who sit at the loaded
board may find matter for merriment in this
corn-murrain, believe me it is rapidly becoming
a subject terrifically tragic."</p>

<p>"At least," said the husband of the Lady
Sabina, with a sigh; "we know to our cost,
that loss is more likely to accrue than gain

<!-- vol 2 page 269 -->

from a rise in the price of the poor man's
bread."</p>

<p>"Loss is <i>sure</i> to arise to the rich man," replied
Invective Rabid, "from all increase in
the cost of the provisions of the poor, because
<i>he</i> must, eventually, pay that augmentation.
This&mdash;until reaching to a certain pitch and
whilst the multitude were only hungering&mdash;might
be an inconvenience only, but past that
point&mdash;when hunger, grown starvation, impels
the ravening masses&mdash;then&mdash;the inconvenience
shifts into an appalling peril; and this peril,
gentlemen, is now treading fast upon our heels.
Want threatens to become utter destitution.
The prospect is before us of a time when the
famishing millions converted into starving
wolves, will be driven by nature's irresistible
law to break into your hoarded store and devour
yourselves like shipwrecked sailors on a
raft, who feeding on each other, no doubt select
the fattest."</p>

<p>Here the glance of Invective Rabid fell on

<!-- vol 2 page 270 -->

the professor, who pale and obese, became a
shade whiter as he shrunk into himself like
a huge maggot, contracting its length into
width.</p>

<p>"Strange accounts have been received to-day,"
said the Lady Sabina's husband, with a
corroborative shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Accounts have been received to-day," continued
Invective Rabid, "suggestive of the
wildest terrors. Your John Cashes and your
Sir Jaspers, seek to make a mystery of these
things&mdash;I don't. Truth is our first duty to the
people; and you gentlemen, though you no
doubt disclaim the soft impeachment, are a
portion of the people: as such, it is no
less due to you. We all know how formerly
it was supposed that the universal failure of any
crop was as rare in nature as a universal flood;
yet such a phenomenon we have witnessed since,
and now it would appear that we are menaced, not
only with the universal prevalence of disease
in one article of food, but with its extension to

<!-- vol 2 page 271 -->

every organic substance. These accounts unhappily
realise my theory, and prove that the
contagion, threatening alike the seed, the root,
and the kine, hangs like a dark cloud over the
future of all humanity."</p>

<p>"Portentous signs are indeed in its horizon,"
said the Lady Sabina's husband, drowning the
reflection in a copious draught.</p>

<p>"And before these signs," observed Myrrah,
"Sir Jasper and Middleman Cautious have
sunk into insignificance, and your fidelity and
friendship have evaporated into air."</p>

<p>"What would you have us do?" said the last
speaker. "I still hold by Sir Jasper; but the
influence of John Cash rises and floats on the
surface of each ascending wave."</p>

<p>"This day," said the Lady Floranthe's husband,
"a deputation has waited on him from
the Bank of Manchester."</p>

<p>"This day the city of Lyons has returned his
unpopular candidate at the eleventh hour, and
implores his financial aid," said Julian.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 272 -->

<p>"By this night's paper," said Lord Besom,
"the capitalists and cultivators of fourteen
counties and departments publicly entreat his
benevolent co-operation, to avert famine and
ruin from their embarrassed population."</p>

<p>"For all that," said Eustatius, "Sir Jasper
will get the better of him."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Invective Rabid.</p>

<p>"Or, at any rate, Middleman Cautious."</p>

<p>"Preposterous!"</p>

<p>"John Cash is the man of the age," said
the Lady Sabina's husband.</p>

<p>"John Cash," replied Invective Rabid, "will
overcome Middleman Cautious as easily as
he will triumph over Sir Jasper. A true type
of the force of circumstances; he may break
through the factitious interests of castes and
classes, but he must himself succumb before
the majesty of the people and their imperishable
rights&mdash;whose principle, if there be no
other, I shall uncompromisingly uphold."</p>

<p>A month before this vaunting speech of Invective

<!-- vol 2 page 273 -->

Rabid would have provoked the contempt
or satire of his listeners. Now it was
received in silence almost deferential.</p>

<p>The fact is that a suspicion prevailed in
every mind of the possible truth of his affirmation.</p>

<p>During the last few weeks they had witnessed
every position giving way before the
fortunes of old Cash, except that of Invective
Rabid and the paper edited by him&mdash;one of
the four great papers of the United Monarchies&mdash;had
within that time so singularly increased in
merit, popularity, and importance, that it
seemed not wholly improbable that these two
men might be arrayed against each other as
the representatives of the two parties which
would have swamped all others.</p>

<p>"At all events," said the Doctor, after a
long pause, "admitting the extent of the calamity&mdash;and
I admit nothing, till the committee
over which I have the honour of presiding
has reported on it&mdash;it is a satisfaction

<!-- vol 2 page 274 -->

that it must affect every one in equal ratio."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lord Besom, "in thus much,
that it touches my neighbour's grain and beeves,
and your professional credit."</p>

<p>"I hope," said the little man, spitefully,
"that it will at least include the palm tree, the
coffee shrub, and the date, in its ravages."</p>

<p>"I trust not," replied the ex-chancellor,
"though I have no immediate interest in those
articles of produce."</p>

<p>"I thought you had estates on the borders
of the Sahara."</p>

<p>"So I have; but I have given up the cultivation
of anything on them but food for my
negro tenantry. "</p>

<p>"From an ill-judged philanthropy?"</p>

<p>"No; on economical grounds. My negroes
multiply&mdash;my estates have never paid as well.
I trust to their spontaneous produce; and I
send out whites to gather it."</p>

<p>"Spontaneous produce, and send out whites

<!-- vol 2 page 275 -->

to gather it! why what is the use of your
black tenantry then?" asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>"My negro tenantry is everything," replied
Lord Besom, "considering that the spontaneous
produce I allude to is negro wool&mdash;a
valuable and beautiful article, indelible in
colour. My negroes prepare their rice, bask
in the sun, chew the betel nut, or dance to the
tom-tom. Once a week they submit their
heads to the shears, and that is all that I require
of them."</p>

<p>"And their hair grows in a week?"</p>

<p>"Not naturally, but by the aid of cultivation
and the hot sun of the tropics. Every
ship that sails to bring home a cargo of the
wool takes out a shipment of macassar oil,
wherewith to manure their heads and ensure
the next week's harvest."</p>

<p>"Well," said the professor, drawing a long
breath. "The opinion is shared by several
members of the committee, that if ever the

<!-- vol 2 page 276 -->

murrain should be transferred to animal life,
that it would become a ringworm."</p>

<p>"Come," said Myrrah, "enough of politics
and of the murrain."</p>

<p>"You are right, beautiful Myrrah," said the
professor, "let us change the subject to more
domestic themes."</p>

<p>"Domestic themes! I thank you for the
hint," said Myrrah. "Doctor, how is your
lady wife?"</p>

<p>"What is the professor married?" asked
several of the guests.</p>

<p>"You shall hear," laughed Myrrah.</p>

<p>"This is too bad," said the disconcerted
Doctor. "I will never confide anything to
you again."</p>

<p>"A politic premium on discretion!
Know then, gentlemen, that the professor <i>is</i>
married. His case is a singular one; he has
been married seven years, and he is yet waiting
the advent of his honeymoon. Shall I
give you the history of his courtship?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 277 -->

<p>"Do, do," said several voices; whereupon
the professor resigned himself to his fate, attempting
to assume a serio-comic gravity, which
soon degenerated into an expression ludicrously
foolish.</p>

<p>"It is seven years ago since I became acquainted
with the professor. Declaring that
there was no other woman like me; he offered
to place me amongst the stars, by naming after
me the new planet he had discovered, providing
I would let him press my fair hand to his lips.
You seem, indeed, convinced that I am unlike
all other women, I replied; for I do not believe
there is any other living who could ever
be induced to grant you the favour you ask of
me. It was in this desperate vein of gallantry&mdash;ready
to have disgraced all the constellations
if he had been allowed to christen them&mdash;and
stung by this rejection that the professor
was called to Ireland.</p>

<p>"At a Christmas party he was induced, notwithstanding
the gravity of his character, to

<!-- vol 2 page 278 -->

lead out to the dance a very beautiful young
lady. He was preparing to apostrophise her
eyes when she squeezed his hand. Some
personal allusion was made to agreeable partners;
he added an airy common-place, about
happiness and such a partner for life, on which,
hint to his surprise, the young lady simpered,
and then implored him 'not to mention it to
her mamma.'</p>

<p>"It had reached the professor's ears that
the beauty was an heiress, and his heart (for
he says he has one) leaped immediately at this
discovery of the sudden impression he had
made. He drew from her the confession that
her mother and brother would never give their
consent to her marriage, because enjoying
her income so long as she remained single;
but at the same time her consent to privately
to become his wife, on the express condition
that the circumstance should be concealed
from her family for some weeks, until she
became of age.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 279 -->

<p>"After he had made due enquiries into her
fortune the lovers met, and were clandestinely
united.</p>

<p>"They parted at the church-door with the
understanding that he was to call that day as
if nothing had happened, and he employed
the intermediate time in penning me a triumphant
bulletin of his success. This done
and expedited&mdash;with a bland smile and an assured
step, he walked to his bride's door and
knocked. He was received, however, by the
mother and brother with a volley of abuse,
in which, to his utter confusion, the bride
joined heartily, vowing that he had trepanned
her into the marriage...that he was fat, vulgar,
odious,...that she abhorred him, and...I believe
he confided to me at the time...adding the
epithet of muffin-faced.</p>

<p>"The poor professor was too glad to abandon
his new wife, her fortune, and her family,
and to resort from the exploration of the female
heart, whose affections he had not the

<!-- vol 2 page 280 -->

art of fixing, to the exploration of the firmament,
whose unknown stars he could reduce to
fixity at pleasure, and so from an unpleasantly
warm admirer, he became, as you perceive,
a most amusing friend."</p>

<p>"And has he never since seen his lady?"
said Julian.</p>

<p>"Listen," answered Myrrah, "after three
years of separation, the bereaved received an
epistle from his wife, in which she expressed
all due contrition for her former conduct
towards her beloved husband, and begged to be
restored (she was an Irish lady) to those dear
arms into which she had never yet been admitted.
Touched by this appeal, he resolved
to forget and forgive, and repaired again to
the green island, where a meeting was arranged
at the house of a relative. His
wife, who was an equestrian, was to ride over
from Dublin, and James, the one eyed groom,
had been dispatched with horses for her.</p>

<p>"The husband was looking forward with

<!-- vol 2 page 281 -->

natural agitation, and the whole of the party
with natural interest, to the meeting, when the
lady dashed at a furious gallop into the yard.</p>

<p>"Before they could get down stairs to give
her welcome... before the husband could help
her to dismount, she had beckoned James to
assist her, and there and then as she alighted
on the ground, in full view of the whole assembled
household, she turned from her astonished
spouse and flung her arms passionately
round the groom's neck, exclaiming,</p>

<p>" 'James! dear James! how I could love
you, why did not I marry you instead of that
odious creature?'</p>

<p>"Since then only three communications have
passed between them. She wrote a second
time to express her contrition, and her wish
to join him: and perhaps you will tell
me which was the most insane, the professor
or his lady, when I inform you that
he was unwise enough to refuse acceding to
this request?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 282 -->

<p>"Unwise?" said Eustatius.</p>

<p>"Unwise, because on that refusal followed
communication the third consisting in a living
pledge of her affection with which she has recently
presented him without his being able to
deduce therefrom any pretext for finally getting
rid of her since by rejection of her previous
offer, he had forfeited all legal right to take
cognisance of her subsequent misconduct."</p>

<p>"This story of the professor," said Julian,
"reminds me of an episode of my very juvenile
days, when reputation was first imposed
upon me, which I have since discontinued endeavouring
to discredit."</p>

<p>"Let us hear it," said Myrrah.</p>

<p>"You must know then," said Julian, "that
I had the misfortune to spend two years of
my youth with an aunt, and godmother, a lady
possessed of godliness which has prompted her
to attempt the redemption of many young
souls from perdition, and of wealth so great as
to have induced many parents to confide to her

<!-- vol 2 page 283 -->

their offspring in the hope of securing for
them her inheritance. You have all heard of
her, I dare say, as the sister of Sir Jasper's
wife. There was another lad with me undergoing
the same course of spiritual regeneration,
dull, cowardly, and sheepish, but in the
estimation of my godmother a far more promising
subject. I was not very tractable, and
three fourths of the mischief done might fairly
have been laid at my door, but he slyly contrived
to saddle me with the remainder. He
was therefore regarded as the Simon Pure and
I as the embryo reprobate always condemned
without a hearing. One day my aunt looked
unusually austere, she lectured me during the
whole dinner on the wickedness of my conduct,
and the precocity of my vices, and at
length informed me that a female with a child
had been enquiring for Master Julian, whom
she declared to be its father. I denied the
allegation with all the indignation of injured
innocence, but was silenced by an imperious

<!-- vol 2 page 284 -->

wave of the hand, and the intimation that I
should be forthwith confronted with the woman
who was below.</p>

<p>"The good lady rose at once to overwhelm
me with what she was pleased to term the
proofs of my profligacy. Her favourite Elijah
delighted at the prospect of seeing me in
trouble sneaked down before us, and I stoutly
followed. No sooner did the mother of the
child set eyes upon him than mistaking him for
your humble servant, she ran up and embraced
him, saying, 'Oh! Master Julian, how could
you be so cruel as to abandon me and this
sweet baby?' "</p>

<p>"The effect of such a scene is more easily
imagined than described," said Myrrah, "because
the narration of any ridiculous surprise
always falls short of the reality, there is a
story I could tell with considerable point of
some individual present in retaliation of a personal
slight," and here Myrrah's eyes wandered
over her guests.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 285 -->

<p>"Whose guilty conscience smites him of
you all, for of that one I am about to make an
example?"</p>

<p>The guests with one accord disclaimed the
imputation.</p>

<p>"Understand me," continued Myrrah, "I
know well who and what I am, and so does all
the world. Now I will not permit those who
with this knowledge solicit admittance to my
intimacy, and eagerly throng my table on
nights like this to insult me in the open day.
There is no one so great and grave in the
United Monarchy who need fear to exchange
with me that passing courtesy which Socrates
might have vouchsafed Aspasia. There is
no one excepting always a bishop or a husband
in the presence of his wife whom I will exempt
from such a duty. Eustatius Cash, do
you remember being in the next box to mine
with the Lady Floranthe, and turning your
glass at her desire full upon my face as she

<!-- vol 2 page 286 -->

dared you to it without deigning me a sign of
recognition?"</p>

<p>"Myrrah!" said Eustatius, "I thought
you had forgiven and forgotten that."</p>

<p>"No," replied Myrrah, "neither in favour
of the gems with which you tried to obliterate,
nor of the excuse with which you sought to
palliate the injury, because you refused the reparation
I proposed."</p>

<p>"That reparation was impossible to a man
of honour. I am sure you would not wish it
mentioned."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," answered Myrrah,
"I only asked that you should come into my
box and stare as vacantly into the face of the
Lady Floranthe."</p>

<p>"And who would dare listen to such a proposition?"
asked the Lady Floranthe's husband
fiercely curling his fair moustache.</p>

<p>"Any one," replied Myrrah, "you would
dare do so by the Lady Floranthe."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 287 -->

<p>"Believe me, I would not leave such an indignity
unpunished."</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied Myrrah, "you would
avenge it by behaving the next night in a
similar manner, to the wife of Eustatius, if
she were not under the especial protection of
her father-in-law. But if I have forgiven the
provocation I have not pardoned the excuse
by which Eustatius sought to palliate the
insult. He said to my face, that it was the result
of a moment's pique at my capricious preference
of a new friend to my old, and behind
my back, echo has repeated to me that he
avowed the same sentiment but with this modification.
That Myrrah must rapidly decline&mdash;since
she had transferred her preference from
the patrician many, to the plebeian one, and
since the nature of the courtesan had broken
out in her choice of the vulgar Demagogue,
Invective Rabid."</p>

<p>"I am ready to avow that, or anything you

<!-- vol 2 page 288 -->

choose to affix upon me in the face of Invective
Rabid," said Eustatius fairly at bay.</p>

<p>"Invective Rabid has left all retribution in
this matter, to me," replied Myrrah, needlessly
appealing by a deprecatory glance to the Democratic
leader, whose equanimity was only
ruffled by a contemptuous smile; "and what if
I were to retort upon this dainty youth&mdash;the
<i>parvenu</i> patrician&mdash;the baseness of his own origin
and connexions?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Myrrah, your tongue is privileged,
you cannot provoke my anger. My father's
origin I admit to be, if not as you term it, base,
perhaps obscure, but we live in an age in which
birth has long ceased to be valued, and in which
all real aristocracy is based on wealth and power,
and on the refinement of education and association.
Like all those here assembled, excepting
one, my hands have never been black
and humid from pressing the greasy palms of
the unwashed; the position I occupy has never
depended on the foul breath of a fickle multitude.

<!-- vol 2 page 289 -->

This is the distinction which separates
me, not politically alone, but socially, from the
champion of the vulgar."</p>

<p>"You talk of association," answered Myrrah,
"do you forget the itinerant vendor, who
fainted on my steps as you were handing me
into my carriage. Who recognised the old play-fellow
and cousin, with whom he used to make
mud pies in the gutter of the lane you both
inhabited, and whom he touchingly reminded
of your childish games of fives, played for
halfpennyworths of hardbake, with knucklebones
of mutton purloined from your mother's
store?"</p>

<p>"I remember it well," said Eustatius, irritated
but not disconcerted. "You sent him to
me, but I think the last anecdote related by
Julian, may show how far assurance sometimes
leads impostors in their attempts at extortion.
The instance you are alluding to,
would have led to the condign punishment of
your <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, had he not voluntarily taken service

<!-- vol 2 page 290 -->

in the Japanese mine corps, where I regret
to say, that his death debars me from obtaining
the personal avowal of his falsehood, to
set off against this ridiculous allegation."</p>

<p>"Bring in my spaniel, and let us have more
wine," said Myrrah, touching a tiny bell,
which summoned her attendants; "and we will
drink oblivion to the past. If it be as you
say, Eustatius, it was too bad of your pretended
cousin&mdash;for he was a most ill-favoured
plebeian-looking dog even when improved by
the accessories of a peach-coloured and silver
livery, hair powder, and paste buckles."</p>

<p>And as Myrrah spoke, she looked full in the
face of an approaching lacquey, who, on this
signal, let fall the spaniel he was bearing on a
velvet cushion, and throwing his arms round
the neck of the haughty millionary, addressed
him as his cousin Tat, and began to sob
aloud.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. CASH.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">So</span> you are really little Jemmy, my sister
Susan's brat?" said the mother of Eustatius,
to a well-dressed but mean-looking personage
introduced to the reader in the last chapter in a
peach-coloured and silver livery.</p>

<p>"Why, bless your kidneys, so you are!
There is the very mark upon your cheek where

<!-- vol 2 page 292 -->

you cut yourself with the broken bottle. Bless
the boy, where has he been all these years?
Jemmy! Jemmy! Jemmy! my own sister's
child&mdash;though you did run off with the change
of that shilling along with the trampers, your
aunt Bess would have been glad to see you
back long ago&mdash;she don't forget that she nursed
you through the measles, that she attended to
your christening and vaccination, and all your
other religious duties&mdash;she don't. Who would
have thought of your turning up after so
long. Well, it is in the nick of time,
and I am right glad to see you, Jemmy&mdash;for as
sure as I hope to be a blessed angel, I never
thought to set eyes on you more."</p>

<p>"My dear, good aunt," said Jemmy, "or
rather, I should say, your ladyship."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Jemmy, all the world
have their ups and downs; and it's a fact, that
we have gone up prodigiously&mdash;but though we
look down upon half the great folks in the
land, flesh and blood, is flesh and blood.

<!-- vol 2 page 293 -->

How is it you did not show forth before?
Did you never hear of us, for your uncle has
feathered his nest along ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! these last several years, I have
heard of John Cash here, and John Cash there.
People used to jeer me on my name, and ask if
I was related to the rich John Cash. How
could I ever dream that it was my uncle?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the millionary's wife, complacently.
"He knows what's o'clock.&mdash;He
knows the time of day&mdash;he knows
which side his bread's buttered, I promise
you. Why, how glad Tat will be to see you&mdash;he
used to be so fond of you&mdash;and yet," she
added, hesitating, "he is so odd, that there is
no telling."</p>

<p>"I have seen Eustatius," replied Jemmy,
across whose gipsy-like countenance there
passed a malignant expression; "and he won't
believe I am your sister's child&mdash;in fact, he
sent me far over the sea, and may get me sent
again, if you won't help me."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 294 -->

<p>Here the nephew related to the aunt, his
meeting with Eustatius on the steps of Myrrah's
dwelling, how the truth had suddenly
flashed upon him, the incredulity and persecution
he had met with at the hands of his
cousin&mdash;his escape from the colonies&mdash;his application
to Myrrah, and the last vain appeal
made, at her suggestion, to the good feeling
of Eustatius.</p>

<p>"Aye," said the poor mother, with a tear in
her eye. "Tat has been brought up quite a
gentleman, and he has grown up ashamed of all
of us. He cares no more for me, than the
ducklings, when they ran into the pond away
from the old hen. I suppose it's right it should
be so&mdash;though, foolish boy, the gentlefolks,
among whom he has been bred, can never love
him half as well as the mother who fed him
with her milk&mdash;who dandled him upon her knee&mdash;whose
heart warms when she hears his footsteps,
and who feels, when he only speaks kindly
to her&mdash;which is not often&mdash;as one does on a

<!-- vol 2 page 295 -->

cold winter's day, when the sun shines out.
The fact is, Jemmy, that we have not been
brought up as he has been, so that perhaps, he
thought you vulgar, ignorant and ridiculous, as
he used to do me&mdash;and that may have angered
him&mdash;for I do not think his heart is bad. You
must do as I have been doing this long time
past, <i>acquire requirement</i>, as he calls it, and
in time, we shall all set horses well enough
together, I daresay. I have learned a great
deal, but I have still much to learn for his sake&mdash;and
if it was not for his sake, you don't
think I would have foreigners, and companions,
and gimcracks round me, or bother my old brain
with a strange tongue, at my time of life, or
worry myself with this smart toggery&mdash;though
this cap is so tasty, and though this brocaded
satin&mdash;which stands alone was made on purpose
for me. No, no, Jemmy, you will still find me
your homely aunt, who will do what she
can, and who can do a good deal&mdash;or
at least, my good man can, and he knows what

<!-- vol 2 page 296 -->

sort of a life I'd lead him, if I was to ask him
and he didn't."</p>

<p>"If you do not think that my uncle Cash
will behave like my cousin, Eustatius," said
Jemmy, dubiously; "I would make bold to
entreat your interest with him."</p>

<p>"Never fear," replied the Aunt, "though
he is master of the mill, I am the missus; so
let's hear what we can do for you?"</p>

<p>"I would make bold to entreat you to
persuade him to give his own nephew&mdash;your
sister's child&mdash;a lift in life&mdash;a sum of money
to set him up in business."</p>

<p>"To be sure he shall," replied the millionary's
wife, rising. "I will speak to him this
very day."</p>

<p>"But, dear aunt," replied the nephew, "how
can I insure getting safe to my uncle? What
if they clap me on shipboard when I quit your
presence, as they did before when I tried to
make way into it?"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the aunt, "they would not

<!-- vol 2 page 297 -->

dare do so; but stay&mdash;if you are afraid to go,
it is twelve o'clock now, and my good man will
be here before one; you shall stay till he
comes. You need not move away from my
apron string; but I am busy, I can't talk any
more to you now, Jemmy. I have my toilet
to arrange for a grand jollification at two, in
which I play first fiddle. But you needn't
mind that with an old woman like me&mdash;I
shall go no further than this room or the next;
and I shall take no more notice of you so long
than if you were a dog or a cat. Now then,
Smithers&mdash;now then, Madmoisellee Fillysee!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Felicie and Smithers obeyed
this summons.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Cash, in a jargon which
she imagined to be French, in answer to the
pure English of Mademoiselle Felicie, "what
of my coiffure?" and she then proceeded to
rate her roundly for the failure of the last
attempt of this kind. "It was all your&mdash;what
do you call taste in French, Smithers?&mdash;stop;

<!-- vol 2 page 298 -->

I will look in my dictionary&mdash;g,
o, u, t, gout&mdash;I thought it was. It was
all your gout, Miss Fillysee. Pray, Jemmy,
if ever you learn French, remember that if
you say a man or woman has got the gout it
means that they have taste. In fact to speak
French correctly you have only to miscall
things, and ask for one when you mean another,&mdash;if
you wish 'em to understand a horse, say a
<i>shovel</i>; call a game a <i>jew</i>, an oak a <i>chain</i>, a
hat a <i>chopper</i>, a cabbage a <i>shoe</i>. It was your
own choice Miss Fillysee."</p>

<p>"Madam," said Mademoiselle Felicie, whose
respectful subserviency gave way before the
imputation of such a monstrosity. "You
took the feathers from one <i>toque</i>, and the
flowers from one cap and the lace from
another."</p>

<p>"To be sure; and a pretty thing it was
even then. Why, Smithers, my son Tat has
not forgiven me for it yet. He says it haunted
him. That it gave him the night-mare. What

<!-- vol 2 page 299 -->

do you call night-mare in French, Smithers?
No&mdash;I will look into my dictionary&mdash;don't
tell me. Oh! <i>coachmare</i>. It gave him the
<i>coachmare</i>, Miss Fillysee, your last <i>toque</i> did.
He said I might as well have had a chest of
drawers upon my head. What do you call a
chest of drawers? No&mdash;I will find it out myself.
He said I might as well have a <i>poitrine
de cale&ccedil;ons</i> upon my head."</p>

<p>"A <i>Commode</i>, Madam," said Smithers.</p>

<p>"No, Smithers," answered Mrs. Cash, "I
have it from the book; and though there may
be two ways of saying the same thing, I
don't see why you should prevent one's making
the most of what one knows."</p>

<p>The attire of Mrs. Cash had been not only
determined upon, but donned when John Cash
made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, Bess," said the millionary, "I see you
are all in your best, you have not forgotten
that the opening of your pet hospital takes
place at two o'clock? I hope you have

<!-- vol 2 page 300 -->

borne in mind the terms on which I am now
with Sir Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have. Don't I think of everything.
I should like to know what you would
do without me, Mr. Cash?"</p>

<p>"Get another wife, my dear," replied John
Cash placidly.</p>

<p>"I do believe you would, if I was to die before
you," said Mrs. Cash; "but so sure as you
did, I'd pray to my Maker to be raised up
from the dead like Lazarus, if only to persecute
you both for bigotry!"</p>

<p>"Well, you are not dead yet, my dear.
But I suppose you have consulted Calliro&euml;&mdash;is
she satisfied with everything?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how she should be otherwise;
it has all been done at her suggestion.
The sister of Sir Jasper's Lady, after witnessing
in my company that frightful railway
crash, and discovering that there was no room
in the hospitals, proposed the endowment of
another by subscription. She hawked it about

<!-- vol 2 page 301 -->

from post to pillar; she whined, cried, and
grew abusive over it, she did everything but
subscribe to it, as Tat says. At last she put
down the name of Mrs. Cash, with a nothing
opposite to it in pencil, and then, by Calliro&euml;'s
advice I scratched down '<i>Elizabeth Cash,
the ground, building, and endowment of the
hospital</i>.' "</p>

<p>"I know it," said John Cash, "and I have
paid willingly for its erection. Its opening
will tell well to-day, though they do say,
my dear, that the least the wife of the proprietor
of so many lines could do was to found
an hospital for railway accidents. But who is
this man?"</p>

<p>"This," said Mrs. Cash, who had called the
attention of her spouse to the presence of her
nephew, by making very intelligible signs to
the latter to step forward, "this, John, is your
own nephew, my own sister's child, little
Jemmy, who ran off with the trampers from
Marrow-bone lane."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 302 -->

<p>"My dear uncle," said Jemmy, falling at
his uncle's feet, as from the gallery he had often
seen sons and nephews do in melodramas.
"I am, indeed the little Jemmy that used
to be."</p>

<p>John Cash said nothing; he only knit his
bushy brows, and listened in silence to the
explanations afforded by his wife and nephew.
His thoughts oscillated between taking this
scion of the house of Cash, by the hand, and
shutting him up in the same asylum with
Tempest. He would have been glad to humiliate
Eustatius, but he dreaded to annoy his
daughter-in-law and favourite.</p>

<p>In this incertitude he put a few straightforward
questions to his nephew. He found
that he had travelled much, that he had notions
of business, intuitive or acquired, that he was
of a speculative turn of mind, and that his
present ambition was limited to the acquisition
of wealth. These interrogatories being therefore

<!-- vol 2 page 303 -->

solved in a satisfactory manner, he honoured
his relative with a formal recognition.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mrs. Cash, "that you
see he is our own flesh and blood, you must do
something for him."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do for you, young
man?"</p>

<p>"Ask him for a good round sum," said the
aunt, nudging her nephew.</p>

<p>"Since you <i>are</i> so rich," said Jemmy, "if
you could let me have a small capital to set
me up in business, I should be everlastingly
grateful to you, dear uncle."</p>

<p>"Don't dear uncle me; I am not your dear
uncle, though you may be a <i>dear</i> nephew if I
were to comply with your request," replied
John Cash facetiously.</p>

<p>"You know," continued the nephew "I
might return it all to you in time with a thousand thanks."</p>

<p>"No," said the uncle, "I had rather have
compound interest."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 304 -->

<p>"I was going to offer it," replied the nephew.</p>

<p>"Well now, Jemmy, tell me, you want a
sum of money, say ten thousand pounds, to
speculate and make more of?&mdash;to make it ten
times ten if you can?"</p>

<p>"If I can, certainly," said Jemmy.</p>

<p>"And when you have got it, are you a lad
to take care of it?"</p>

<p>Jemmy nodded acquiescence, and grinned
knowingly in reply.</p>

<p>"Then, when you get it," said the uncle,
"take my advice and never lend it to a speculative
nephew, because he might lose it all and
never pay you back again."</p>

<p>"Well I never!" ejaculated Mrs. Cash.
"Won't you lend it him&mdash;won't you lend him
ten thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear."</p>

<p>"What an old screw; do you mean to bate
him down?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 305 -->

<p>"No; he would be less like to pay me back
a lesser sum."</p>

<p>"And you mean to leave your flesh and
blood in misery."</p>

<p>"No, Betsy; not that either," replied John.
"Come along Jemmy. Catch hold of my
arm; your name is Cash; you shall walk with
me through the Stock Exchange; that will
be worth more to you by a long chalk, than
ten thousand pounds, even if you had your
peach-coloured livery on, and I shall keep my
money in my pocket."</p>

<p>At this moment the Lady Straightlace, the
sister of Sir Jasper's wife, was announced, and
the nephew was led out, his arm trembling
with emotion in the arm of his eccentric
uncle.</p>

<p>"Well, my worthy friend," said the Lady
Straightlace, when the first salutations had
passed between them, "what has the Lord
done for you since we met last?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 306 -->

<p>"Nothing particular," replied Mrs. Cash a
little puzzled.</p>

<p>Here the Lady Straightlace groaned audibly.</p>

<p>"I have been favoured, as I humbly hope,
with an inspiration of grace&mdash;a farther suggestion
respecting what might be done for the
conversion of our heathen brethren; it is contained
in a letter of sixteen pages from the
correspondent of the S. M. M. S."</p>

<p>Here her Ladyship read through this lengthy
document, which consisted chiefly in censure
on the European authorities and colonists, and
in unceasing panegyrics on the native virtues
of the heathens, whose conversion the South
Ministering Missionary Society was struggling
to effect.</p>

<p>"Now what do you say to that, my worthy
Mrs. Cash? What do you say to these interesting
savages?"</p>

<p>"Only," replied Mrs. Cash, "that if they
are so very good and so much better than our

<!-- vol 2 page 307 -->

people, what a pity it must be to meddle with
them."</p>

<p>"Ah! but you forget they are cannibals,"
observed Lady Straightlace. "What does
your good husband say? I am counting on
his subscription to the S. M. M. S."</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Mrs. Cash, "he calls
it the society for making mischief amongst
Savages."</p>

<p>"Your husband is a profane jester, Mrs.
Cash. Did you tell him that their mission
was to preach brotherly love to Cannibals?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Mrs. Cash, "he bade me tell
you that if Cannibals they must be <i>fond</i>
of their fellow creatures without further
teaching."</p>

<p>"This is awful," said Lady Straightlace,
but judging from the imperturbable countenance
of the millionary's wife that she was innocent
of her husband's meaning, she continued,
"Never mind. If Eve led Adam

<!-- vol 2 page 308 -->

into sin it has since become the mission of
wives to efface by their good works the impiety
of husbands. We must associate together,
Mrs. Cash, in some great work of regeneration
to which we may consider the inauguration
we are met to celebrate this day as a preliminary
step. There is no reason, Mrs. Cash,
why your wealth and the pious energy
with which I humbly trust I am endowed
should not suffice to forward one of those great
movements which electrify humanity. Such
movements have been got up by, pious zeal in
past ages as many of my brethren inform me.
There was even the great Temperance movement
in which tens of millions pledged themselves
to abstain from liquor at the suggestion
of the famous what's his name, beginning with
an M."</p>

<p>"What was his name Smithers?" said Mrs.
Cash.</p>

<p>"Whose name, Madam?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 309 -->

<p>"The man we are talking about who made
the people what-you-may-call-it?"</p>

<p>"Who made them take the Temperance
pledge," replied Smithers. "It was first
Mahomet and afterwards Father Matthew, but
both supposed to be the same personage by
Niebuhr St. Thomas, in the same manner as the
Scriptural Japhet and mythological Jupiter
are undoubtedly identical."</p>

<p>"Well, this noble association in works of
piety and charity we seal to-day by the opening
of our hospital for the relief and care of
compound fractures and internal contusions&mdash;contingencies
unhappily much multiplied of late
and requiring in their attendance peculiar patience,
care, and skill. I came to consult you
as to the inscription to record its destination.
Suppose it were something simple and to
this effect:&mdash;Planned, built, and endowed
1907, by Mrs. Elizabeth Cash and the Lady
Bountiful Straightlace&mdash;or by the Lady

<!-- vol 2 page 310 -->

Bountiful Straightlace and Mrs. Elizabeth
Cash."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Cash, "Betsy Cash paid
for it, and Betsy Cash will have the credit of
it, the inscription is cut and carved already.
Hospital for the treatment of compound fractions
and internal confusions, and my name
and the date in small letters under it."</p>

<p>The Lady Straightlace bit her lip, though
without the slightest inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>"Compound fractures and internal contusions,"
suggested Smithers, words which Mrs.
Cash was repeating when the Lady Calliro&euml;
was introduced. Half an hour after the
whole party, invited to witness the opening of
the charity, were assembled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash was in high good humour, her
disposition was charitable&mdash;she read the approval
of her fastidious daughter-in-law,
and of her still more fastidious son, in their
looks, for both felt how much this noble use of

<!-- vol 2 page 311 -->

their mother's wealth must tend to cover her
many ridicules.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said the worthy matron,
"let me be quite sure of those long words,
ah! I do now remember them, the hospital for
the treatment of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Compound fractures."</p>

<p>"Compound fractures, and&mdash;stop a minute&mdash;eternal
conclusions."</p>

<p>"Internal contusions."</p>

<p>"Internal contusions, ah! now I have it,"
said Mrs. Cash, quite glibly. "Hospital for
the treatment of confounded fractures and infernal
contusions."</p>

<p>The attention of Eustatius was at this moment
diverted by the hilarity apparent on the
faces of the crowd returning from inspection
of the inscription, surmounting the portals of
the edifice.</p>

<p>"You are sure it is quite simple?" he asked
with some misgiving.</p>

<p>"Quite simple," said his mother, "nothing

<!-- vol 2 page 312 -->

but my name, Elizabeth Cash, wife of John
Cash, and the date."</p>

<p>As the carriage drove up, they found that
Mrs. Cash had spoken truth, and yet in that
short sentence she had contrived to introduce
a mistake so ludicrous as to provoke the
general laughter of the crowd.</p>

<p>The building was magnificent, and ample,
the space before it crowded with carriages,
banners waved over it, and sacred music was
heard within. On its broad fa&ccedil;ade was
inscribed in gigantic letters, the purpose of its
foundation, and under it in characters deeply
graven in the stone, though only legible within
a certain distance.</p>

<p>As Eustatius turned aside in profound disgust,
his eye, sensitively acute, caught sight of
his father descending the steps of the opposite
Bourse arm-in-arm with the hero of the peach-coloured
livery.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">RENUNCIATION.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span> sir," said John Cash to his son,
"what have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Shall I retire?" said the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>"No, stay;" said the old man; and his son reiterated
this permission, which his wife had not
asked of him.</p>

<p>"I have this to say," replied Eustatius, who
was much excited, but whose resolution seemed
to fail him before the cool, scrutinizing glance
of his father, "I have this to say, sir, that
though you have never honoured me by reposing

<!-- vol 2 page 315 -->

in me any confidence, reserving that for one
whose virtues as a wife appear to be absorbed
in her duties as a daughter, that a crisis is at
hand which imposes on me the necessity of
speaking, and impels me, sir, to obtrude my
unsolicited advice."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the father.</p>

<p>"I thank you for that permission. Emboldened
by it, I proceed, though I should have
ventured to assume as a right that privilege, as
your son and heir&mdash;and as the only scion of our
house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is to say, excepting Jemmy!"</p>

<p>A darker shade passed across the usually
impassive features of Eustatius at this unfortunate
allusion; but he continued:</p>

<p>"As such I can have no interest but the
prosperity of that house; and, next to yourself,
have the most immediate interest in that prosperity.
Hitherto, I will not deny that, it has
been both rapidly progressive and creditable to
your foresight and prudence."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 316 -->

<p>"You are very good," said John Cash
drily.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Eustatius, on whose eloquence
this observation acted as a damper, changing
his tone from pompous exposition to entreaty,
"do not let us bandy sarcasm, I implore of
you, at such a moment!"</p>

<p>"What moment?" asked old Cash, provokingly.</p>

<p>"A moment," said his son, "in which the
fortunes and the greatness of our house is
menaced&mdash;a moment which threatens to level
in the dust the patient labours of so many
years&mdash;a moment in which the enmity of all
the world has combined against us, and in
which that moral blindness has possessed you,
with which the gods are said to afflict those
whom they have predoomed to ruin. Listen
to me, sir: you have risen to eminence and authority;
you have taken your place <i>amongst</i> the
great and powerful, but you are not <i>of</i> them.
My education, my associations, and my pursuits

<!-- vol 2 page 317 -->

have blent me in more intimate connection
with those with whom it is impossible that
you should ever cordially comingle, and it may
be that I have awakened sympathies which
have induced; for my sake, a forbearance such
as may still be our salvation. You have a
party, sir, I know, you have sycophants and
followers numerous enough to have enabled
you to turn the balance in the late political
crisis. Middleman Cautious was almost minister
one day, Sir Jasper our friend and patron
was in the ascendancy the next, and in this
uncertain contest of jarring elements, whilst
each was baffled by the other a casual and temporary
preponderance has permitted you to
step into the place which they were struggling
for. Middleman Cautious had no majority.
Joined with him you had a majority against Sir
Jasper and on the strength of that fictitious
majority you are, according to our constitutional
customs, Premier for the time being.

<!-- vol 2 page 318 -->

It is an imposing but untenable position.
Those whose place you have usurped, whose
confidence and esteem you have forfeited, and
whose bitter enmity you have incurred, are
uniting to expel you from it; but you may
still make terms before it is too late. Our
ridicules have rendered us already the theme
of the United Monarchies in the midst of your
successes&mdash;judge what a laughing stock we
shall become when bowed beneath the indignity
of inevitable failure and disgrace. There
is still time, Sir, to reconcile these menacing
animosities, and to secure a pardon and a position
more unequivocal if less brilliant&mdash;I come
charged to negotiate it with you from those
who within one hour may be your friends and
colleagues, or fraternising in irreconcileable
enmity against you."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said John Cash.</p>

<p>Eustatius was silent with vexation.</p>

<p>"Then go back to those who have taught

<!-- vol 2 page 319 -->

you to fetch and carry; go back to those who
are making a cat's paw of you, and tell them
that John Cash answers to their proposition&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"Listen then," replied Eustatius, "I
have fulfilled to the last, the duties of a
son."</p>

<p>"Banding with your father's enemies and
snubbing your own mother."</p>

<p>"No sir," said Eustatius, "repudiating <i>his</i>
absurdity, and endeavouring to repress <i>her</i> ridicules,
which he has so unfeelingly and indecently
dragged into light. I have my birth
for which to thank you, sir, and I might have
been indebted to you for my education, if its
nature had not been such as to render me
acutely sensible to the contumely which your
caprice has lately drawn upon me, but you
will be pleased to remark that the position to
which that education has raised me, has its exigences
which I cannot, and will not neglect&mdash;and
you will, therefore, understand how it

<!-- vol 2 page 320 -->

becomes me, to separate my political identity
from yours, if your obduracy remains immoveable."</p>

<p>"Pray make your election," said John
Cash.</p>

<p>"I have no choice," replied Eustatius. "If
you are blind to your interests, I must look to
mine." And then addressing Calliro&euml;, "but
you, madam, have a choice to make&mdash;you, who
do not vouchsafe one effort to avert disgrace
and ruin from him, whom, for purposes best
known to yourself, you flatter by such abject
deference. You, madam, will have to choose between
your husband and his father."</p>

<p>Neither the Lady Calliro&euml; nor old Cash made
answer, and Eustatius continued,</p>

<p>"At this moment&mdash;whilst I am speaking to
you, the <i>mene mene thekel</i> of our fortunes&mdash;<i>ours</i>
unless my forethought separates <i>mine</i> from
yours&mdash;is being written on the wall.</p>

<p>"I have fulfilled my duty as a son. I shall
waste no more futile efforts to persuade. I

<!-- vol 2 page 321 -->

now denounce, and may that denunciation yet
prove salutary!</p>

<p>"At this moment, sir, know then, that the
sworn foes of a quarter of a century are united,
the prejudice of castes and classes are levelled in
hostility to your ascendancy. I come from a
conclave in which Middleman Cautious and
Sir Jasper sit side by side&mdash;where patrician and
plebeian, where churchman and layman, where
moderate and rationalist, are united in a common
enmity, and gathered for a common purpose&mdash;your
expulsion from the post you occupy.</p>

<p>"In that assemblage, Sir, the chief of your
former supporters may be found; in that assemblage,
madam, your father has a seat; to
that assemblage I, your husband, now return,
if not as a mediator between its anger and
my father's rashness, to disclaim all sympathy
with, or participation in his stolid ambition.
You, madam, must, therefore, too, make your

<!-- vol 2 page 322 -->

election; you must remain with him or follow
me."</p>

<p>"Eustatius," said old Cash more earnestly
than he had yet spoken, "beware; do not
expose your folly to those who will kiss my
feet to-night."</p>

<p>"Chimeras!" replied Eustatius, "what
do you say, madam, are you prepared to
brave repudiation by me&mdash;disgrace and ridicule
and ruin, by adhering to a sinking
vessel?"</p>

<p>"I have faith in your father," answered
Calliro&euml;, "faith enough to walk without sinking,
on the surface of the waters. I would
stand by him if I knew he was about to fall,
and I am sure that he will triumph; you have
my answer."</p>

<p>"And if I command, will you forget your
duty as a wife?"</p>

<p>"To the husband who forgets his duty as a
son."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 323 -->

<p>"Enough; remember, sir, that you renounce
a son&mdash;you, madam, a husband, by that resolution!"
said Eustatius striding to the door,
through which he vanished, as old Cash replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, sir; it is you renounce a father and
a wife; but go on, sir, renouncing till you renounce
your folly!"</p>

<p>When Eustatius had departed, the millionary
turned to his daughter-in-law, and said
gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thank you, Calliro&euml;. But do you know
that he speaks truth? At this moment it looks
like all the world against old Cash. Why
should you stand by him?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe in you, not in the
world; because I know that your success is
the result of a mighty system, and that you
are not the creature, but the creator of your
fortunes."</p>

<p>"You have read aright," replied old Cash,

<!-- vol 2 page 324 -->

taking her hand. "You are a bold and noble
girl, and if the world be round, as they say it
is, I will put it, some day, under that tiny foot
of yours in pastime."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 325 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">A DILEMMA.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span> and Middleman Cautious, burying
the rivalry of years, had really met in confidential
concert.</p>

<p>That night John Cash was to bring in the
bill which he had invidiously thrown out
when chaperoned by Sir Jasper, and both Sir
Jasper and his former opponent had made unheard
of efforts to crush him by their united
influence.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 326 -->

<p>The appeal made by each to his former partisans
had exceeded the most sanguine anticipations
which the previous conduct of their
followers could reasonably justify. The
chief political notabilities&mdash;the patricians entitled
to most weight, and the moderates most
influential, had for some time hesitated to compromise
themselves in any movement hostile to
old Cash&mdash;yielding only to the solicitations of
their former leaders after witnessing the list
of adherents to the proposed combination.
In fact the financial shocks which were disordering
the internal framework of society in
that commercial and monetary age, had brought
every capitalist into straits which left his
fortune at the mercy of another, who, in turn,
depended on the precarious forbearance of a
third.</p>

<p>The thread of all these influences was really
centered in the hands of John Cash, by a
transmission so complicate as to be entirely
occult. It thus happened that each of those

<!-- vol 2 page 327 -->

regarded by another, as the arbiter of his
fate&mdash;was only a puppet quailing before some
unconscious agent, himself circumscribed by
a like chain of imperious liabilities to a cycle,
traced by the millionary's master hand.</p>

<p>It was thus that John Cash had so readily
secured his majority, whilst the numerous and
avowedly hostile gathering collected at the
summons of Middleman Cautious and Sir Jasper,
was a result of the consummate skill
with which he concealed his own action on
the toils he had spread so cunningly.</p>

<p>But this gathering proved, as he foresaw,
barren and deceptive in proportion to its promise.
Each individual forming part of this
assemblage was attracted by the attendance
of some other by whose will the independence
of his own action was really fettered, and who
himself was no free agent.</p>

<p>Though therefore an encouraging array of
partisans gladdened the sight of the two
leaders, the explanation which ensued soon discovered

<!-- vol 2 page 328 -->

the fallacy of the impression under
which they had assembled, and Middleman
Cautious and Sir Jasper, when their followers
had compared notes, each retired to confer
together, filled with disappointment which they
sought mutually to conceal.</p>

<p>Both had been rendered so acutely perspicuous
by their individual failure as readily to
suspect the deception they were seeking to practise
on each other, and after some ingenious and
protracted efforts to sustain these hollow pretensions,
both simultaneously acknowledged the
futility of the endeavour.</p>

<p>"After all," said Sir Jasper, "if we consider
the low figure to which such of our partisans
as will give us their unqualified support
are reduced, perhaps we must admit that our
united force falls very far short of that upon
which we separately counted."</p>

<p>"We must admit," replied Middleman Cautious,
"that our best chance lies in the moral
influence of our combination on John Cash."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 329 -->

<p>"Or in other words," rejoined Sir Jasper,
"candidly avow that our most reasonable
hopes centre in the mission of Eustatius."</p>

<p>"It is useless," added Middleman Cautious,
"to disguise the fact that&mdash;whether separately
or united&mdash;we can make no good and efficient
fight. Our parties are like houses built up of
cards, each supported by, and depending on,
the other. They are good only for a show. I
was deceived by it myself. I was never more
deceived in my whole political career, and to
this appearance we must trust."</p>

<p>"He will not dare to brave it," observed
Sir Jasper, with an assumption of confidence
which his voice denied, and at this moment
Eustatius was announced.</p>

<p>His countenance betrayed some anxiety and
alarm, blent with that expression of self-gratulation,
which the inmates of a burning house
exhibit, when they pause to contemplate
their present safety, and the danger they have
escaped.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 330 -->

<p>"Gentlemen," said Eustatius, with respectful
solemnity, "my father's ruin must be on
his own head."</p>

<p>"Does he refuse all compromise?" asked Sir
Jasper.</p>

<p>"All compromise?" echoed Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>"I lament to say," replied Eustatius, "that
he is rashly obdurate."</p>

<p>"Will he listen to no terms?"</p>

<p>"No gentlemen, he is mad enough to set us
all at defiance."</p>

<p>There did not follow, as Eustatius expected,
any haughty rejoinder, or any fiat of political
outlawry against his misguided sire. On the
contrary, to his unspeakable surprise, the two
statesmen looked at each other in utter consternation.</p>

<p>At length Middleman Cautious ejaculated,</p>

<p>"Then the game is up!"</p>

<p>"The game <i>is</i> up," echoed Sir Jasper, "a
malediction on him!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 331 -->

<p>"After all, he is lord of the ascendant," said
Middleman Cautious. "So here ends our alliance,
Sir Jasper, for I shall make my submission."</p>

<p>"Stay," said Sir Jasper, whose pride, whose
former station, and whose personal hostility
forbade all compromise of which he now began
to envy his colleague the facility. "Stay;
all is not hopeless yet. The banks, the public
companies, the universities, the academy, the
church, and the great bulk of the patricians
are still irreconcileably hostile to him."</p>

<p>"What matter?" replied Middleman Cautious,
"every man who has a vote is in his
leading strings. We have found it out to our
cost, to-day, and it is too late to make a revolution
now."</p>

<p>"Well said," Sir Jasper, "I at least, will
die in my harness."</p>

<p>"And I beneath your banner," said Eustatius.</p>

<p>"I thank you," answered the ex-minister,

<!-- vol 2 page 332 -->

"let us now proceed to see who will stand
by us when Middleman Cautious separates his
interests from mine."</p>

<p>Not until that trial, did Sir Jasper find how
pale his star had waned. In vain he turned
from one hesitating partisan to another&mdash;in
vain, he recalled former favours and suggested
tempting hopes. He could obtain no unconditional
adherence. Even the Lady Sabina's
husband, who had been delegated in
most active, hostility to John Cash, took upon
himself to waver, and Lord Lofty, his last
hope, turned very ghastly, and muttering with
white lips, something about family ties and
force of circumstances, braved all the reproaches
of his former idol.</p>

<p>But the fertility of Sir Jasper's genius, and
the elasticity of his spirit, did not abandon
him in this emergency. Though all compromise
was impossible and though his position was
at present irrecoverable the thought flashed,
across him, of a means by which he

<!-- vol 2 page 333 -->

might retrieve it through the future. He
foresaw as distinctly as Middleman Cautious,
that it was hopeless to attempt to triumph
over John Cash. He foresaw that the United
Monarchies would, from an Oligarchy, become
a virtual kingdom, but forgetful of
his own age, he reflected that John Cash
was old, and he knew that his son&mdash;the inheritor
of his wealth and influence, in whom,
the hopes of discontent and disappointment
would centre&mdash;was a fool.</p>

<p>On these convictions, Sir Jasper based his
plans. He dreamed an opposition to the millionary,
of which, Eustatius should be the instrument
and base, and he the head and hand,
and a few words sufficed to convince him that
he would find in the son of John Cash a
willing tool.</p>

<p>Neither when that assembly broke up, did
Sir Jasper and Eustatius seem isolated, for
though most of those who had any direct political
voice, had seceded from the ex-minister's

<!-- vol 2 page 334 -->

interest, the remainder&mdash;whom old Cash had not
taken means to influence&mdash;were unanimous in
their animosity to him; and far more vehement
in expressing their feeling than the seceders;
who, though now without hesitation, did
not feel that they cut a very creditable figure
in the course they were pursuing.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">JOHN CASH.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">No</span>, I have no confident in the world, but
you, Calliro&euml;," said old Cash. "I once scouted
the idea of having any; and though I have
found such designs as I am harbouring
oppressive to a lone breast, stout though it be,
I should not have disburthened its secrets
even to you, had it not been that you have
understood and divined&mdash;untaught and uninformed
as the birds of the air and the beasts of
the field, who know the approaching storm
and coming frost&mdash;things which disturb and
baffle even my strong brain.</p>

<p>"I feel the want of some one, too, who can

<!-- vol 2 page 336 -->

have no interest but my own, to whom I can
unfold my plans&mdash;some one who can assure
that my great combinations&mdash;sown like the
seed and ripened into the tree&mdash;are indeed the
fruit of my own forethought and daring patience&mdash;some
one who can say to me, John Cash
you have not dreamed that you devised all
this, for I heard you say it would be so
and so.</p>

<p>"I feel the want of one to whom I can reveal
the strange agency which chance threw
into my way, and who can judge how nobly
I have played out those cards put into my hands
by fortune, which might have led another&mdash;&mdash;I
know not whither."</p>

<p>"To the madhouse cell, or the pauper-pallet,"
murmured Calliro&euml;, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"What," said old Cash, with a start, looking
a little wildly at her, "what puts these
things into your thoughts?&mdash;and yet why not?
Why should not those who wasted such golden

<!-- vol 2 page 337 -->

opportunities, expiate that neglect there or
elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"It is true," said Calliro&euml;, "that the world
is full of misery and meanness; it is true, that
you are progressing towards the mastery of the
world, and that you can readily reform it
when you have mastered it."</p>

<p>"We will master it at any rate," replied the
millionary.</p>

<p>"But why not now?" asked Calliro&euml;, "you
have long been Lord of its bread. I know
that all vast conquests entail great sacrifices&mdash;that
tens of thousands perish in war&mdash;that
millions have been transferred to bondage to
square a treaty or secure a recognition&mdash;but
why needlessly coerce? why needlessly
make them suffer whether for one's own
greatness or their eventual welfare."</p>

<p>"I am, I have been for years, master of the
world's bread," replied old Cash; "but without
craft and patience that power would have

<!-- vol 2 page 338 -->

proved only fatal. It was John Cash against
the world; and the world, which will be one
day at his feet, would long ago have crushed
John Cash, if he had braved it in the face of
day. It must be bound with bonds that it
cannot see&mdash;it must be subdued and held by
patient policy; and he who subdues must not
stand forth in its sight as its master, or he
will share the fate of vulgar tyrants&mdash;the
world will prove too many for him&mdash;mark
that!</p>

<p>"They have built up a state of things,"
continued the old man, "in which money rules
the masses. I have long had the means of
mastering every man's wealth; but if I had
deprived the staunch supporters of property
of that property, whose rights they uphold
so manfully, these makers of the law would, by
some enactment, have undone me. It was
therefore necessary to make money a means of
mastering the law, and the law a means of
mastering money. A fool, like Eustatius, or

<!-- vol 2 page 339 -->

a craven, like your father, would have been
crushed already by the weight of those treasures
whose dominion intelligence can make
absolute."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Calliro&euml;, "equal
daring and prudence have been necessary. I
like that word <i>absolute</i>&mdash;I hope it will be absolute.
We have no business with power, if
we mean to misuse it, and used well it cannot
be too efficient. You bring in your great Bill
to-night?"</p>

<p>"I <i>pass</i> the great Bill to-night."</p>

<p>"But how reduce to submission the elements
of this oligarchy&mdash;which after all is a
democracy of the few&mdash;without some eventful
revolution?"</p>

<p>"Easily," replied John Cash. "I have a
means infallible&mdash;gold, gold, gold&mdash;let me only
make it safe, and the world is my own. It
needs no other revolution."</p>

<p>"I can understand the potency of gold," replied

<!-- vol 2 page 340 -->

Calliro&euml;; "but it has ruled before, and
found limits to its power."</p>

<p>"Aye," said the old man, "but you forget
that wealth has never been set off before like
mine by the world's poverty. Now mark me.
Without meddling with our constitutional
laws&mdash;without overturning one corporate or
popular privilege&mdash;by the sole agency of gold&mdash;I
will sway a power before which that of all
preceding despotisms shall fade into insignificance; for my wealth will be acting on a
world which I have beggared."</p>

<p>"But," argued Calliro&euml;, "if the age is covetous,
and its oligarchy individually money-loving,
it is not quite corruptible, and the surface
of society is studded over with impregnable
points of honour. The church, the bench, the
army and the bar may not be tempted, and the
venality of legislators has its limits, if only in
their pride."</p>

<p>"Wait," replied John Cash, "till you see
the prelate and the soldier and the judge&mdash;now

<!-- vol 2 page 341 -->

sternly proof against the influence of gold&mdash;pinched
by that total absence of its support
which we call poverty&mdash;wait till you see the
tempted man turn indignantly from the
golden lure held out, only to rest his eyes on
the necessity and misery of those dear to
him, and then tell me what gold cannot
do?"</p>

<p>"And is there none?" asked Calliro&euml;&mdash;"none
who can dispel this magnificent conception,
making it like the vision of a dream?"</p>

<p>"There was one," replied John Cash setting
his teeth together and breathing hard
"but he is no more."</p>

<p>"And is there no other?"</p>

<p>"There is one other&mdash;your instinct prompts
you truly&mdash;only one&mdash;who might cross my
path&mdash;<i>our</i> path, Calliro&euml;, but he is so far
safe&mdash;at least do you not think he is secure?"
And here the superstition of the strong-minded
man spoke out.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 342 -->

<p>"Who and what is he?" asked Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>"Nay, I can explain no further now," replied
the millionary. "He may be a mere
bugbear&mdash;I believe he is&mdash;but this I feel that
unless he thwart me, the future is all my
own."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">TEMPEST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was midnight, and Tempest paced up and
down his cell. A terrible conviction had
forced itself upon him. The attendant who
had come to see him safe for the night, had
casually dropped a daily paper, an article
which had hitherto been strictly withheld
from him. It referred precisely to the day on
which Invective Rabid had assured him that
a public effort had been made on his behalf.

<!-- vol 2 page 344 -->

Of this he found no traces; but on the contrary
discovered his labours appropriated almost
without change by the daring plagiarist.</p>

<p>It was obvious, not only that he was betrayed&mdash;not
only that he was without the
friend he counted on, but that another bold,
crafty and unscrupulous man, had acquired the
deepest interest in the continuance of his incarceration.</p>

<p>What hope was there for him in the world?
What conceivable avenue of escape?</p>

<p>He was still pacing up and down his cell
when the booming of cannon disturbed his
melancholy reverie. The cell door opened.
His keeper or attendant stood before him. He
had returned for the paper he had missed.</p>

<p>"I must make haste," said the menial, "to
light the lamps&mdash;we illuminate to-night&mdash;did
you hear the cannon just now? John Cash,
the patron of this establishment, has passed the
great bill which will make every poor man rich
and every blackguard a gentleman."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 345 -->

<p>At this grotesque announcement of the triumph
of his persecutor, Tempest sat down and leaned
his face in his hands with a feeling akin to despair;
but after a few moments, his bold
spirit, which had reeled before these prostrating
blows, recovered something of its elasticity.</p>

<p>"At least," he reflected, "in the discovery
of this treachery, I am one step further advanced
than I was this morning."</p>

<p>But turn over his position as he would, he
could find no other source of consolation. Such
was the condition of the man whose image at
that very hour, flashed across and troubled the
thoughts of John Cash in the midst of the
success which the thunder of a hundred cannon
and the roar of a hundred thousand voices
were proclaiming.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">THE INSECT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the wind sweeps over the blue seas&mdash;when
it ruffles the smooth surface of the
lake, or rushes with the gush of the quick
river, wafting the humid exhalations of the
waters far over the fair shore, it scatters no
longer fertility and promise.</p>

<p>The boor in the rich grass of his fading pastures;
the Teuton in his parched fields; the
Iberian in his arid plains, and the Sclavonian
in his thirsting steppes, watches in vain the
clouds, which, sailing from the west, dissolve

<!-- vol 2 page 347 -->

in genial rain. Better for him to welcome
the locust or the blight; for the murrain is
in that rain. It is sucked into the soil with
each descending shower; it lurks in every
drop of dew, and infiltrates through every artery
and vein, invisibly small, of the stem,
leaf, or flower of root and grain. The insect
of the galvanist is in the third stage of transition.
In every transition it becomes more
minute and subtle. A single drop of water
has been computed to contain a thousand million
animalcules, discernible by the microscope,
crowding and jostling each other&mdash;a larger
number than the whole human population of the
earth.</p>

<p>Let the reader now imagine an atomic being
bearing the same proportion of magnitude to
these infinitesimal denizens of a drop of water,
as they to the human species, or as that watery
globule to the terrestrial orb. Let this insect
be conceived gradually insinuating itself into
the most exiguous vessels and fibres, whose

<!-- vol 2 page 348 -->

net-work transmits vitality to the extremities
of the organic system, and let it there be
imagined writhing and revelling like the
monsters reflected by the hydro-oxygen microscope&mdash;curving
its snake-like form into a bow,
and then, through the projectile power thus acquired,
shooting forth perpendicularly its hideous body, and discharging at the end of each
propulsive movement its myriad larv&aelig;, like a
rocket bursting into stars. Let this progeny,
matured and fitted to reproduce in less than
the space of one human pulsation, be conceived
to multiply till its multitude bursts the very tube
in which it has been generated, and some idea
may be formed of the progress of the murrain
and of its destructive effects upon organic
life.</p>

<p>In each stage of transition the insect undergoes
a change of form and properties, like that
which has been experienced by many species
transmitted to our old world through a chain
of extinct varieties, whose remains still teem

<!-- vol 2 page 349 -->

amongst its early wreck; and only through
these gradations to be recognised as connected
with its prim&aelig;val type.</p>

<p>But this change, in which days occupy
the space of ages, is infinitely greater and
more rapid, and in each transition, the insect
grows more subtle, minute, and mischievous,
because adapted to prey on more perfect
bodies, or to impregnate more completely
those with which it was already fitted to
assimilate.</p>

<p>At each stage the murrain becomes more
difficult to baffle by the antidote. It has
spread from the grain to the root, from the
root to the grass, from the grass to the cattle,
extending thus its ravages from vegetable to
animal life.</p>

<p>No corresponding benefits&mdash;as with the evils
nature generates&mdash;compensate the destruction
it occasions, but unseen by human eye, it
works its loathsome way, a curse to all mankind,
but <span class="smcap">one</span>, who sees a blessing in this

<!-- vol 2 page 350 -->

scourge of all humanity. Whilst John Cash in
the applauding senate turns pale as the image
of Tempest flashes across his thoughts, the
man who in his cell can still strike terror
into the breast of his all-powerful master,
trembles in his turn&mdash;not before the fortunes of
his triumphant persecutor, but in the contemplation&mdash;to
which the profound discouragement
if that hour gives rise&mdash;of the growth and
progress of the <span class="smcap">Insect</span>.</p>

<h2>SIXTY YEARS HENCE.</h2>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">RESULT OF SIX MONTHS INTERVAL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> months have passed away, the great bulk
of the people, who have never enjoyed more
than a bare sufficiency of food and raiment,
suffer little by the scarcity; but those who live
by the labour of others, whether great capitalists
or petty farmers or traders, have one by
one seen the accumulated fruits of labour,
called capital, pass from their hands. A heavy
but inevitable tax weighs upon the first necessaries

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

of life, because the antidote to the murrain
is quite indispensable to all primary
articles of produce, as the guano had become,
fifty years ago, to certain lands barren without
this fertilising principle.</p>

<p>But the millions affected by this ruinous
state of things are kept quiescent by the
facilities afforded them by all the national and
local banking establishments. As they have
wisely not been driven to despair, and as the
credit to be obtained depends upon the general
tranquillity, they are on the contrary the most
zealous supporters of public order.</p>

<p>As each man now depends on his credit he
carefully conceals his circumstances from his
neighbours, and all living on the indulgent
forbearance of their unseen creditor, continue
ignorant of the general bankruptcy and dependence.</p>

<p>If we now turn to that portion of society constituting
the political world, we shall find that
it has learned&mdash;after the rapid succession of

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

events which half a year ago disturbed its long
apathy&mdash;to view without surprise the great
but gradual change which has taken place
during that period.</p>

<p>Having witnessed, within the space of a
few weeks, the alternate ascendancy of various
political sects and leaders, the wreck and dissolution
of time-honoured parties, and the
appearance of new and preponderating characters
in the political arena&mdash;men begin to
regard the possession of power as legitimatised
by half a year's uninterrupted enjoyment, and
the respectability of an opposition as established
by six months of consistency and continuance.</p>

<p>Nothing is changed in the external forms of
the United Monarchies.</p>

<p>Their dynasties immured in grand, Loma-like
seclusion still figure in public pageants.
The federal assembly still meets and deliberates;
John Cash is still premier and is

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

still opposed, as all previous ministers have
been, by a party in the senate.</p>

<p>But for those who look beneath the unruffled
surface of things the whole constitution of
the state is changed. John Cash, the nominal
premier, is its acknowledged sovereign, and a
sovereign about as absolute in 1907 as Louis
Phillippe the first, of happy memory, would
have made himself in 1846 if all his deputies
had been sufficiently moderate in their price
and equally venal and timid. Middleman
Cautious is the real minister and devoted
servant of this potentate, and though the opposition
is not like that traditionally attributed
to College Green, "All one way," the most
chimerical of its partisans does not dream of
any proximate majority.</p>

<p>This opposition, combining two distinct
shades of opinion, embraces two distinct sections,
the one presided over by Invective Rabid,
and the other by Sir Jasper&mdash;in the name of
Eustatius Cash.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

<p>It is now universally suspected that there
are few individuals whose fortune is not at the
mercy of John Cash, but even the most abjectly
submissive of his followers do not
forget that a day of illness may transfer the
power thence derived into the hands of the
sullen and vindictive Eustatius, and hence the
weight of his position, though in open hostility
to his father, serves quite as much to keep his
party together, as the talent of Sir Jasper, or
the fame and daring of Invective Rabid.</p>

<p>It will thus be perceived that Sir Jasper
and Middleman Cautious have sunk into second
rate importance, and that John Cash, Eustatius,
and Invective Rabid stand prominent in
the political drama.</p>

<p>John Cash is regarded by the whole people
as a despot whose unspeakable yoke is hopelessly
imposed upon it during his lifetime.
Eustatius is approved by the democrats for his
liberal demonstrations, by the oligarchs for the
hope which his weakness inspires of some day

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

seducing from his hands the power they dare
not attempt to snatch from the grasp of his
astute and energetic father.</p>

<p>Both oligarchs and democrats applaud and
extol Invective Rabid as the meet adversary,
and uncompromising antagonist of their common
enemy. For as a common enemy both
the popular and aristocratic parties now regard
him, though both in their successive necessities
had invoked the intervention of absolute authority
in preference to compromise with each
other, herein obeying the instinct which, perhaps
to preserve religious and political creeds
from fusion, renders them less inimical to adverse
extremes, than to those shades of opinion
which trench more closely on their own.</p>

<p>Statues of bronze are raised to John Cash
on palaces, marts, exchanges, railway-termini,
and in the halls of public companies; but the
figure of Invective Rabid hangs in rude woodcuts
on the poor man's whitewashed walls, or

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

gesticulates in plaster of Paris, or in terracotta
on the image vendor's board.</p>

<p>John Cash, in the popular estimation, now
epitomises in his person the wealth and government
of the United Monarchies, and Invective
Rabid is looked upon as the patriot "<i>sans peur
et sans reproche</i>," whose chivalrous advocacy
of the right of the many against the power of
the one, alone curbs in some measure its encroachment.</p>

<p>In truth, however, the millionary could undoubtedly
both overbear all resistance and
reduce his adversary to silence, only that his
unerring sagacity teaches him, that a certain
licence of speech and of discussion operates as
a safety valve to the ebullition of feeling
inevitable in a state of society still mindful of
its former comparative independence, and he
judges his virtual absolutism none the less
secure because he allows those whom he
governs to pull upon the rein by which he can
at will restrain them.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

<p>Like many sovereigns who have preceded him&mdash;and
on the principle of the Scotch Laird who
had a son in each camp&mdash;John Cash, too, has
seen the advantage of having his immediate
successor in the opposition, if opposition there
must needs be.</p>

<p>He had therefore done nothing originally to
discourage this tendency, little suspecting the
acrimonious feeling into which it would unnaturally
ripen in one whose eventual interests
were identical with his own. But six months
have both developed and accustomed the
world to the hostility of the father and son;
and six months have served to habituate it to
the final separation of Eustatius and the Lady
Calliro&euml;, who more than ever enjoys the confidence
and favour of old Cash.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash is still magnificently absurd, and
has always the control of her husband's purse-strings,
a privilege to which she owes the brief
visits of her son, whose necessities she supplies

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

with the profusion of a mother, accounting as
she best can for the enormous increase of her
expenditure, a pious fraud to which John
Cash shuts his eyes.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE LADY FLORANTHE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a cloudless morning and the sun beams
so brightly through the hangings, that its
light might have been deemed not sufficiently
subdued for charms less susceptible of its
searching scrutiny, than the beauty of the
Lady Floranthe. She is besides prepared to
face the full radiance of day, because attired in
her walking costume for the purpose of profiting
by its matinal freshness. But though unusually

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

early, even for her to be seen in those
apartments, she is startled to find her husband
already on foot and sleeping in a chair.</p>

<p>The fact is, that not long returned home he
has fallen in that position, overpowered by
weakness and fatigue. His wasted form, his
pale, attenuated features and their haggard
expression, speak of the last night's orgie, and
of a long previous course of dissipation; and
yet, the poor wretch dreams that he has still
the strength which he abused, and has fallen
asleep in the intent of seeking the refreshment
of a change of raiment and the bath before proceeding
to a scene of fresh debauchery.</p>

<p>Mutual indifference, and indeed disgust,
have long characterised the intercourse of this
wife and husband.</p>

<p>By tacit agreement, and even by specific
consent, both parties follow the bent of their
own inclinations without interference, comment,
or recrimination. There is but one
point of confidential and almost friendly contact

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

between them&mdash;that of their pecuniary
and political interests. This is neutral ground,
on which they meet with the cordiality of
business partners useful to each other&mdash;the
partnership of this couple being only in the
weight and influence of the name they jointly
bear, and in the fortune they divide with
scrupulous exactness, and spend with perfect
independence of each other.</p>

<p>Formerly the advantages of this association
were nearly balanced. The wife was possessed
of capacities which her sex prevented her from
directly utilitising, the husband occupied a
position which he had no gifts to enable him
to turn to account, without her guidance. But
time and circumstances had destroyed this
equilibrium. With the subversion of the
former authority of the magnates, the husband
is rapidly sinking into a nonentity, whilst the
ambitious wife, whose merits are rather personal
than adventitious, is rising into notoriety and
importance. Just too as he has ceased contributing

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

to the common stock, and just as pecuniary
embarrassments are gathering round them,
his expenditure is become ruinously lavish, and
his conduct so openly scandalous as to be
humiliating even to the indifference of his
wife.</p>

<p>It was with the increased aversion to which
these considerations had given rise, that the
Lady Floranthe was about to turn away, as
we do from an object both loathsome in itself
and from its obtrusion, from an owl or a bat
in the broad day, or from a lizard on our
drawing room carpet; when her attention was
rivetted by the change which had come over
his wan features.</p>

<p>A dark shade encircled the sunken orbits of
his eyes, the hectic flush subsided, his lips
were of an ashy whiteness, and his whole
aspect, but for the troubled sleep and the
throbbing of the deep blue veins, seen prominently
through the transparent pallor of his
temples, would have been that of death&mdash;death

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

rendered more ghastly by the bright, warm,
mid-day sun, which streamed over the distorted
countenance and disordered attire of
this victim of the night, its disease and its intemperance.</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe has been long cognizant
and indifferent to the fact that her husband
is dying by inches, because every step he
makes towards the grave has been a personal
insult to herself, and an advance towards her
deliverance; but still the truth placed before
her in all the relief which this hideous contrast
offers, has thawed for a moment the frozen
fount of affectionate pity.</p>

<p>After contemplating for a few minutes, in
painful silence, the ravages of a few weeks&mdash;for
it was weeks since they had even met&mdash;she
placed her fair hand lightly on his forehead,
but even the motion disturbed his unsound
slumber, for he started, uttering, mechanically
the last words of the licentious, (or as the
French have it <i>d&eacute;braill&eacute;</i>,) toast he had been

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

drinking. Then starting and looking haggardly
round him he called for more wine, addressing
his wife&mdash;whom he did not yet recognise&mdash;by
the name of a celebrated dancer, as graceful in
her steps, as graceless in her morals.</p>

<p>Even his first return to consciousness was
not shown by perception of the Lady Floranthe's
presence, so little did she occupy his
wandering thoughts, but they were first recalled
by the vivid glare of day and by the sound of
an opposite pendulum which struck twelve.</p>

<p>"Mid-day, already! why did you let me
sleep? I don't want sleep, sleep does not refresh
me. I ought to have been dressed and
away. Give me some water&mdash;are my horses
ready? I have a wager coming off at twelve
o'clock."</p>

<p>The wife placed her hand upon his, and
called him softly by his name. The husband
now first perceiving whom he was addressing,
replied,</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, madam! I crave your pardon for

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

being here and in this guise. I know not how
it has happened; I retire," and he rose with
a courtly salutation, walked a few paces with
a staggering gait, and then sat down again a
little giddied.</p>

<p>"You are not well," said the Lady Floranthe,
almost tenderly, "you are suffering&mdash;you
must retire to rest."</p>

<p>"Madam," replied the husband, "since
when do we interfere with each others'
actions?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" replied the Lady Floranthe,
"do not misunderstand me, I would only
advise."</p>

<p>"Believe me, that my intrusion here cannot
be more distasteful to you than your advice to
me."</p>

<p>"Hear me," said the Lady Floranthe,
earnestly. "I speak only from interest in you,
and&mdash;" she checked herself as she was about
to add "compassion," "I should neglect my
duty, I will not say as a wife, but as a friend

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

by remaining silent. You must take care of
yourself&mdash;you are ill&mdash;you are very ill, Hugh."</p>

<p>"Hugh," repeated the husband, ironically,
"why not dear Hugh, madam? It is late
in the day for us to play the 'Darby and Joan.'
I wish you good morning. I have an appointment,
I am late, and I must call first at my
jeweller's."</p>

<p>"Common humanity and pity impel me then
to lay bare to you the truth, and command
this interference. The wild career of dissipation
you are pursuing is rapidly hurrying to an
untimely close, a life which care and abstinence
might still prolong. The name we have jointly
borne so long, our residence beneath one roof,
the interests we have shared, justify this solicitude,
which believe me is sincere, and of which
the expression is urgent, not untimely even,
though irksome to you."</p>

<p>"Why allude to our union, Madam? We have
neither of us forgotten the circumstances under
which it was contracted. It is not good breeding

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

to remind our friends of their infirmities,
or their misfortunes. You should have compassion
on the state of my health; though, thank
heaven! it is not what you imagine. Though
I have been a little feeble lately, I have an
iron constitution. When I overstrain it, it
gives way, and then rights itself."</p>

<p>"Not without abstinence and repose."</p>

<p>"My remedy is hom&oelig;opathic; excitement
only, cures what excitement has caused; but
it must be of a more amusing kind than this
discussion. I have not slept excepting a few
minutes here, since the night before last, and
I am better to-day than I was yesterday, even
though it thwart your theories and your
wishes&mdash;I am progressing."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Lady Floranthe, "to your
own destruction."</p>

<p>"Even if it were so&mdash;and it is not, for I am
getting stout and strong&mdash;do you think I would
not sooner that my last moments were soothed
by sweet smiles, or by melodious sounds, or in

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

the pleasurable delirium of excitement, rather
than rendered irksome by these tardy lamentations?"</p>

<p>With these words he had gained the door.</p>

<p>"Indeed you are not fit to go out. Hear
me one moment!" said the wife.</p>

<p>"No," replied the husband in a galliardly,
boastful tone which contrasted strangely with
his weakness, as to sustain his emaciated frame
he leaned against the door. "No, upon my
honour, I should keep a lady waiting,&mdash;and
then," he added, as if a sudden thought had
struck him, "but since we have met, madam, I
remember that yesterday my steward denied
me the sum I asked until these liabilities are
staved off; and I want gold to-morrow&mdash;I
want gold to-day&mdash;in fact I want gold at all
hours and times just now."</p>

<p>"We must share ruin as we have shared
prosperity," replied the Lady Floranthe, "Our
property is mortgaged as far as it will go; and
we depend on the indulgence of companies in

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

which the influence of John Cash is paramount."</p>

<p>"Ah, I would have veered round to John
Cash long ago."</p>

<p>"Securing so perpetual dependence on him.
No, I shall manage this matter as I have done
before, by means of Eustatius through his
mother."</p>

<p>"Ah, Eustatius!" replied the husband sarcastically,
looking through the window, "he
is at your gate. I wish you a good day. If
report speak truth, you will not press me to
stay now."</p>

<p>"Eustatius is the keystone of our party."</p>

<p>"Eustatius, and the convenient chances of
a disease, and an inheritance, and a marriage
are the keystones of whole castles in the air.
But if the disease neglects its deadly work, or
the hero of the romance proves fickle, or unwilling,
what then?"</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe grew pale, and the
blood suffused her face and neck. In her inmost

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

heart the thought had arisen, repulsed
with horror at first, but gaining strength as it
recurred&mdash;that all the power of John Cash&mdash;Eustatius
must inherit; that Eustatius, easy
to guide, was not difficult to captivate; that
her husband's and the Lady Calliro&euml;'s health
promised inevitably to leave Eustatius and
herself at liberty, but that when his hand was
free it might be lost in the general competition
for such a prize."</p>

<p>But her husband relieved her embarrassment
by adding, "And the daughter destined for
him in your impenetrable intent, must grow
up equally dutiful and pleasing. Think what
may not have chanced, for even that first
wrinkle of her mother's will have multiplied
and deepened before then." and with this
offensive sarcasm he withdrew.</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe's pity had vanished.
She glanced in a mirror, and the fear this false
alarm had excited, vanished also just as Eustatius
was announced.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

<p>Eustatius, after professing at several periods
a fitful admiration of the Lady Floranthe, had
of late been suggestively assiduous in his
attentions towards her.</p>

<p>He was one of those persons who, though
not in any other sense imaginative, derive all
their affections from the imagination. Abstracting
the intrinsic merits of all things, he
prized them only in proportion to their rarity,
or valued them according to the estimation in
which others held them.</p>

<p>The fame and fashionable celebrity of the
Lady Floranthe had therefore proved irresistible
attractions to him; and the unscrupulous
beauty had lured him on, as a bird or butterfly
seduces a child into a pursuit offering difficulty
enough to impart a zest to the chase though
holding out too much promise to discourage.
The admiration of Eustatius had thus been
ripened into a passion, if not of the heart of
the head, and a passion in which envy had as
large a share as vanity.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

<p>In fact all the pique of unsuccessful rivalry
rankled in the bosom of Eustatius, and of this
rivalry Julian was the object. It had so happened
that he had always crossed the path and
deeply mortified the pride of the millionary's
son in all his schemes of love or gallantry.
The reader may recall how Julian had triumphantly
carried off Myrrah, and Eustatius knew,
with how much truth he boasted, that the Lady
Calliro&euml;'s hand had only been relinquished by
him in consideration of the governor-generalship
which had purchased his abandonment of
a claim more potent&mdash;though founded only in
her affections&mdash;than all the seductions, position
and wealth could render that, urged by his
rival.</p>

<p>In his aspirations to the favour of the Lady
Floranthe he had again found a competitor
and according to report a not unsuccessful
competitor in Julian, who, on his last return
from his government, had assiduously cultivated
her good graces.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

<p>In truth she had made this flirtation, began
in a spirit of irrepressible coquetry, a means
of exciting the jealousy and increasing the
ardor of Eustatius and she had succeeded so far
beyond her wishes that the first few words exchanged
between them, showed that he was
inconveniently under the influence of that
passion.</p>

<p>"I am too early?" said Eustatius endeavouring
to disguise, in a tone of forced urbanity,
the sullen ill-humor which his countenance
betrayed.</p>

<p>"Do you find it too early?" asked the Lady
Floranthe, answering his query by this conciliatory
question.</p>

<p>"If before I am welcome," replied Eustatius
ungraciously.</p>

<p>"Those whose society gives us pleasure are
welcome at all hours of which the occupations
do not preclude reception. I thought I named
two o'clock. It is a miracle that I am down;

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

a chance that you found me before my morning's
walk."</p>

<p>"Scarcely a chance; I knew that I should find
you, or at least that you were matinal to-day."</p>

<p>"By inspiration?"</p>

<p>"No, by inference."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you; what do you
mean, Eustatius?"</p>

<p>"Only," replied Eustatius, "that Julian is
arrived."</p>

<p>"Julian!"</p>

<p>"You are pleased to be discreet."</p>

<p>"Is Julian indeed returned?"</p>

<p>"I met him half an hour ago, he told me he
had an appointment at twelve o'clock, and
therefore I spurred on to beg that you will excuse
me at two."</p>

<p>"Why, <i>therefore?</i>"</p>

<p>"I thought it would be a pity to interrupt a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> so soon."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean," replied
the Lady Floranthe, more in sorrow than in

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

anger, "I have no appointment with Julian,
I am not expecting Julian."</p>

<p>"Then behold! he comes unlooked for,"
and Eustatius pointed through the window at
the young governor-general advancing at the
canter of his Arab, "and so not to be obstinate
as well as inopportune, I retire."</p>

<p>"Eustatius," said the Lady Floranthe after
a pause, "really you do me injustice; I knew
nothing&mdash;nothing of this visit. I will deny
myself."</p>

<p>"It is too late. I hear the clank of his spurs
upon the staircase. Your people are not accustomed
to deny him."</p>

<p>"Is it too late?" said the lady imploringly.
"If so, Eustatius, I beg of you, retire into this
room, or let me go forth into the next to meet
him."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Eustatius, "he may hold
official rank above me, but I think the world
does not give him any other precedence."</p>

<p>"Hear me! I would not have you meet for

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

worlds. He is the vainest man in the United
Monarchies, and when his vanity is hurt his
tongue does not hesitate to tear a female reputation
into tatters."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> awkward," answered Eustatius "when
two assignations become confounded."</p>

<p>"Oh! Eustatius," said the Lady Floranthe,
"you do me injustice. This is unkind. I
declare, by all that is solemn, that I knew not
of Julian's coming. No, you shall not go, I
will dismiss him. You shall hear." And with
these words the Lady Floranthe, without
waiting his reply, advanced into the adjacent
apartment, quitting Eustatius on its threshold
and disappearing through the curtain which
masked the open door.</p>

<p>Eustatius was thus left an almost authorised
listener, or at least in a situation which licenced
him to overhear what was about to pass, without
manifesting an indelicacy too derogatory.</p>

<p>Julian, just recalled by the premier from the
luxuriant idleness of his harem to suffer the

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

infliction of a reprimand, had yet lost nothing
of the graces which made him the hero of so
much feminine reverie and remark; though on
the verge of the critical period which witnesses
the sudden decline of that stamp of male
beauty, of which the characteristics are not
strictly masculine. The waist had not yet began
to enlarge, the waving locks to thin, nor the
blush of the peach upon his cheek to merge
into the ruddiness of the apple.</p>

<p>As Julian advanced, the Lady Floranthe put
her finger to her lips and cast a glance behind her,
but it so happened that at this moment&mdash;having
turned back his head to assure himself that
they were alone&mdash;the sign had escaped his
notice.</p>

<p>"Queen of my thoughts! Bright ladye
of my love and idol of my dreams!" said
Julian, tossing back his dark curls. "Half
the circumference of the earth divided us when
you vouchsafed a wish that I was by your
side. The salt spray of the Persian gulf still

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

tingles on my cheek&mdash;the burning dust of
Palestine is still in my locks&mdash;and lo! I am
at your feet."</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe saw it was too late now
to deceive Eustatius by repetition of her warning
to Julian, so changing her tactics she replied,
as she withdrew the hand he attempted
to press to his lips.</p>

<p>"Welcome! but I am almost alarmed to
find, that redolent of eastern hyperbole you
construe seriously the idle words of a daughter
of the West!"</p>

<p>"I have brought back from the East,"
answered Julian, "nothing but its burning
passion; nothing but the mad idolatry into
which it has matured the love born in my
bosom in the West; the love of which you are
the object."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! hush!" said the Lady Floranthe,
"you must not talk to me of love, at
least in the second person."</p>

<p>"An unfortunate prohibition," answered

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

Julian, "for on my soul I can speak to you of
nothing else but love. Remember how time
flies, dearest Floranthe&mdash;time spent with <i>you</i>&mdash;and
cease this coquetry."</p>

<p>"My moments too are limited," replied the
lady, "for I did not expect this pleasure."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Julian, "do not repress the
tumultuous joy that has made my heart leap
with emotion, by such cold looks, and by such
chilling words. You know, beloved Floranthe,
that my adoration is not the growth of one
capricious hour. You know that you were
relentless and unkind till fate became cruel:
and you cannot have forgotten the entrancing
avowal of that moonlight hour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind moonlight hours," interrupted
the Lady Floranthe hurriedly, "let us talk
reasonably Julian."</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten the sweet admission
contained in those dear lines&mdash;still warm
with my fervent kisses&mdash;still reposing next my

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

heart&mdash;which have brought me to your feet
to-day."</p>

<p>"Julian," said the Lady Floranthe, "we
are all in some measure creatures of impulse;
our feelings change sometimes from hour to
hour we know not why; and for good or evil I
obey their dictates. Now tell me, if really I
were willing to indulge in a dream of love?"</p>

<p>"A dream?" replied Julian, "why call that
a dream which is unalterable as the most stern
reality? A dream! though you are right, for
me the passion you may deign to share conjures
up a vision such as only delights our
slumbers, when prismatic tints and diaphanous
forms flit in the bright delirium of the night,
conveying to our senses a foretaste of heaven!"</p>

<p>"And if," said the Lady Floranthe, "wearied
with the adulation of the multitude&mdash;if
abdicating the mission in which I once had
faith&mdash;the assertion of my sex's dignity&mdash;if I
were to believe in the homage of one heart&mdash;yours,
for instance, Julian?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

<p>"Oh!" interrupted Julian, "if the most
unchanging constancy&mdash;if the most passionate
adoration&mdash;if the most delirious worship..."</p>

<p>But the Lady Floranthe continued silencing
even the fervor of this interruption.</p>

<p>"If it were so; if I were to risk the wreck
of all my hopes, no ordinary affection would
requite my own; I should be inexorably exacting;
and he in whom all the feelings of my
soul would centre must meet my unmeasured
love by a passion as intense, and prove it by
every imaginable sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Speak, beloved Floranthe!" said Julian,
"in the wide range of human possibilities
there is nothing can appal...there is nothing
could deter, from such an offering...on such an
altar!"</p>

<p>"This is agreeable," thought the mortified
Eustatius, his lip white and his hand trembling
with agitation on the curtain which he had
seized to tear aside, an act from which

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

he still restrained himself as the lady continued.</p>

<p>"What offering is there but a heart that
can requite the sacrifice of a heart? But I
should exact that, in one devoted to me, no
other image, thought, or passion should obtrude.
I should require the utter abnegation
of every interest and affection, the abandonment
of the habits of a life, the abdication of
its projects and ambition."</p>

<p>"All these would be but feathers in the
balance," said Julian. "What is there that
you could ask and I deny?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the Lady Floranthe, "I
should impose no ordinary trials. What if I
were to bid you choose between me and your
honour?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt?" said Julian.
"What if I were to demand that you should
throw up your present office?"</p>

<p>"This is unpleasantly straightforward," thought
Julian, "but perhaps they are going to take

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

the governor-generalship from me," and falling
at her feet he answered aloud,</p>

<p>"I would say, Idol of my soul command and
I obey!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but stay," replied the Lady Floranthe.
"It is notorious that you have said all this to
every woman you have ever met; how shall I
now dare believe that you speak truth?"</p>

<p>"Trust to the inspirations of your nature
and interrogate the instincts of your woman's
heart; they will teach you to discern the real
from the false&mdash;they will enable you to distinguish
the depth and plenitude of my unalterable
passion."</p>

<p>At this moment the curtain was moved with
so much violence that Julian could not have
failed to perceive it, if the Lady Floranthe had
not astounded him by bursting into a loud
laugh, none the less musical and silvery because
prolonged and hearty.</p>

<p>"Admirable! admirable! You must forgive

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

me, Julian, but I really believe you thought I
was in earnest."</p>

<p>Julian looked aghast.</p>

<p>"I have carried my point; I have heard you
make a declaration; but since you have acted
this scene so often&mdash;since you have deceived
so many&mdash;it was only fair that one of my sex
should act and deceive you in her turn."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Julian, "why torture me by
such a jest."</p>

<p>"A jest indeed!" and the Lady Floranthe
laughed again, "an admirable mystification.
Rise, my Don Juan of the rueful countenance,
rise, and tell me, did you really believe that I
was serious?"</p>

<p>"Did you think <i>me</i> so?" asked Julian starting
to his feet with a laugh as natural and full
of merriment as her own. "We are two
master spirits. I congratulate you; we could
both take the stage by storm. Your part was
admirably played&mdash;more admirably perhaps
than safely."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

<p>"I was not aware of the remotest danger,"
replied the Lady Floranthe, "I never risked
my heart."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that would have been better than
to peril your reputation. Let us just glance at
our amorous correspondence: there is your
answer to my last pathetic epistle, perhaps I
should call it my circular, for I sent six by the
same courier. I told you that I bore that
answer next my heart, but I had left it in my
dressing case; it might give point to this very
diverting story."</p>

<p>"You have no letter of mine signed even
by an initial."</p>

<p>"You forget the hand-writing, that peculiar,
clear, and delicate hand-writing."</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe laughed again.</p>

<p>"You are quite in error&mdash;all my notes and
letters are copied by a companion, who writes,
but who cannot read."</p>

<p>Julian bit his lip with vexation.</p>

<p>"And now," said the Lady Floranthe "I lament

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

that my minutes are numbered, and I can
only express my hope that whilst the histrionic
art has gained such an accession I shall never
lose a friend."</p>

<p>"Farewell then," said Julian nothing disconcerted,
"since you dismiss me so cruelly from
your presence. But to return the compliment
I shall declare to the wide world, that as the
Lady Floranthe exceeds every woman in it, but
one, in wit, eloquence, and beauty, so she is
only inferior to that one as an actress."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"An actress by profession,&mdash;her name is
Myrrah&mdash;your husband can describe her if you
wish it," and with these words, Julian, having
succeeded in ruffling the serenity of the Lady
Floranthe, made his exit.</p>

<p>The brow of Eustatius was radiant with
delight&mdash;one thing only was wanting to complete
his triumph and Julian's mortification,
that was, that the governor-general should
perceive the cause of his discomfiture, and for

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

this purpose he rushed to the window. Unluckily
Julian would not look up&mdash;at length
he reined up his arab. Was it to cast back a
lingering glance at the casement of the fair
traitress? No, it was only to pass his fingers
through his long curls and remedy their disarray,
after which he spurred forward and was lost
to sight, and at that moment the Lady Floranthe
lay her hand upon the shoulder of
Eustatius.</p>

<p>Eustatius, his grey eyes beaming with enthusiastic
admiration, now turned towards the
woman who having administered that delicious
draught to his vanity and invidious feeling,
had become almost a divinity in his estimation;
but the Lady Floranthe saw and pursued her
advantage, and coquettishly dismissed him
till the morrow, waiving the appointed interview
to punish him for having doubted.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">TEMPEST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Invective Rabid</span>, according to his wont, stole
in so silently that he did not disturb Tempest's
reverie&mdash;half slumber and half meditation, in
which sleep and thought contended to be, perhaps,
afterwards mingled into dreams. He
paused for a moment in contemplation of his
victim, struck by the change in the youth's
aspect which those months of confinement, of
which he was the accomplice, had made.</p>

<p>If there had been less at stake for Invective

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

Rabid, he would not have yielded to the
temptation&mdash;if there had existed any means,
consistent with his own safety, of compensating
the prisoner for his captivity, he would not
have neglected them, but the lure had been
too great, and the peril of discovery and shame
was too imminent, and he therefore drowned
the cries of his own conscience by such
sophistries as the following:</p>

<p>"After all it was John Cash imprisoned,
and I am not bound to liberate him. He
would be no further advanced if he had never
met me.</p>

<p>"His talents are at least directed against
his persecutor. We are bound to devote our
faculties to the public cause, which his misguided
efforts might otherwise have injured;
and, after all, if I profit by his exertions and
his genius, what then? Does not man take
the milk of the cow and the honey of the bee?
Does he not appropriate the fleece of the
sheep, and the scent of the hound, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

fleetness of the steed, and legitimately too, so
that they be devoted to a good purpose."</p>

<p>With these soothing reflections Invective
Rabid advanced towards Tempest, who raised
his head and turned upon him one of his habitually,
penetrating looks, which troubled&mdash;and
irritated because they troubled&mdash;the popular
leader, who piqued himself on an assurance
which nothing could abash, but hiding his
discomfiture in a burst of boisterous cordiality,
he pressed the wan hand of Tempest in his
gigantic palm, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Come! come! cheer up. You must not
despond, we shall baffle the old man yet."</p>

<p>"I have never doubted it," replied Tempest,
"I do not despond. If I am dejected
it is in the contemplation of the selfishness and
treachery of those whom the world holds in
fair esteem."</p>

<p>"It is a sad theme," said Invective, "and
we can but hope in the compensating virtues
of those who are beneath its ban; but you

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

must not lose courage&mdash;you must not slacken
in your zeal&mdash;we are both in captive thrall to-day,
but we shall burst amongst them like a
thunderbolt before long, only we must not
be idle," and as he spoke he glanced at the
deal table, usually piled with books and papers,
and now bare, for though six months had
elapsed since Tempest had become cognisant
of his treachery, for reasons best known to
himself, he had continued, without comment,
to devote his labours, as before, to the service
of his false friend.</p>

<p>"I have not been idle," answered Tempest,
"I completed my half year's task three days
ago when last you visited me."</p>

<p>"What task have you completed?"</p>

<p>"That of unmasking an impostor and a
traitor!" said Tempest, calmly, but looking so
steadfastly at Invective Rabid that he could
not mistake his meaning.</p>

<p>"Now hear me, Invective Rabid."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

<p>"Invective Rabid!" echoed the Demagogue,
his features growing almost purple.</p>

<p>"Why do you call me Invective Rabid?
Some of these madmen&mdash;some of the mad
attendants have imposed upon you. I am a
persecuted captive like yourself."</p>

<p>"No," continued Tempest, "you <i>are</i> Invective
Rabid, the popular leader; you have
never been a captive here, you have never
deceived me, at least during the last six
months of a plagiarism, not only base but
heartless, because exercised at the expense
of my freedom, and of the popular liberties
for your own personal aggrandisement."</p>

<p>At every word, Invective bounded as a
caged lion seared by a hot iron. The veins
upon his forehead swelled into the prominence
of whipcord, his teeth might have been heard
grinding together, and he dug his nails into
the palms of his clenched hands, so intense was
the shame of this proud man, who had never
quailed before human being. But this expression

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

of humiliation was too intense to last,
or to merge into contrition, and it changed to
hatred and defiance and a boastful villainy,
which, perhaps, could hardly have sustained
itself beyond that moment of unnatural excitement.</p>

<p>This change came over his features before
he could find words and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Presumptuous pedant! Learn to distinguish
between that talent which is the instrument,
and the genius which directs it...the
genius to whose guidance fortune has committed
subordinate abilities, as the tool by
which to influence the destiny of states! Learn
all the difference between the sheep which
gives its fleece, or the steer which yields its
strength, and man&mdash;man who comes naked
into the world&mdash;man who grows up the weakest
of all animals, but whose master mind appropriates
and utilises all these gifts. Moreover
know, that in pursuance of his mission nature
has endowed creation's lord with a relentless

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

heart, which neither the plaint of the shorn
lamb, nor the affrighted bellow of the ox,
which travail-worn he destines to the shambles,
can touch or turn from his unchanging purpose.
Know that the fate of those predestined to
mark in their generation, become the oracle of
millions yet unborn&mdash;the Cromwells and Mahomets
of the world&mdash;rolls like the pitiless car
of the Hindoo god, crushing without remorse
beneath its wheels countless individualities!
And lastly, know that the existence of innumerable
Tempests must be consumed to mould
the fortunes of one Invective Rabid! Bow
therefore, poor victim of an inevitable doom!
before that superiority which you blaspheme.
We meet no more; for you the world's stage
is irrevocably closed, and I can leave you only
this consolation, that you have played the not
ignoble part, of contributing to Invective
Rabid's greatness!"</p>

<p>With these words he moved towards the
door, still writhing beneath the scorn of
Tempest's withering glance.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

<p>"Stay!" said the youth at length. "Insensate
mime! travestying presumption in the
garb of prophecy, and aping inspiration! Have
you indeed been so misguided as to believe
that effrontery and cunning could prevail
against intellect&mdash;and the gifts of mind unsullied
in their development by impurity of purpose?"</p>

<p>"You will have time," replied Invective
"to solve that question when the door closes
upon your living grave."</p>

<p>"Stay yet," said Tempest, "why do you
think that cognizant of your treachery six
months ago, I should have continued to further
all your views?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows," replied Invective, "your
men of talent, gifted with one faculty at the
expense of others, are always in some things
fools! why does the bee, robbed of its honey,
fill the hive again? You acted, no doubt, in
obedience to an instinct implanted in your
mind that my destiny might be fulfilled."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

<p>"No, miserable man," replied Tempest.
"It was the stratagem of the despoiled marking
his coin for the detection of the villain
who had robbed him. Now listen to the
scheme that I devised, and learn, to your confusion,
how, shut off from all communion with
any but the spoiler, I have made him the
instrument of his own denunciation to the
world. There is not a thought stolen from
my brain, there is not a passage in which it is
conveyed, on which I have not stamped the
theft. For six months the labours of my days
and nights, which you thought to apply to
your selfish purposes, were framed to contain
the history of my persecution and of your
treachery.</p>

<p>"Refer to your leaders, your essays, and
your speeches, and you will find that each is
an acrostic. The capital letters commencing
every sentence constitute a connected narrative,
which in all the detail of names, dates
and locality publishes to the world my story.

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

Six months ago you had grown too idle even
to re-arrange or alter one sentence of the materials
furnished you; but to render your exposure
certain, the narration of my wrongs is
set forth in a hundred documents which you
have pompously published to the world. One
hint to the public, like the spark in a mine,
blasts your reputation irrecoverably, and dooms
you to an infamy more wide and lasting than
the fame you have usurped!"</p>

<p>A hoarse cry, more like the scream of an
affrighted bird than to a human articulation,
burst from Invective Rabid's throat. I have
heard such from the osprey and the eagle when
surprised behind a jutting rock they rise within
a few feet of the fatal gun. His first impulse&mdash;thus
foiled, lost and degraded&mdash;was to dash
out his brains against the walls of his victim's
cell, and then a hope shot across his brain, and
his brow darkened with a homicidal thought,
as he bounded upon Tempest with the ferocity
of a tiger.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

<p>"But these words you have not spoken?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Tempest, "I have not spoken
them yet. I will be merciful; there is no
human heart, however black with guilt, in
which the germ of human feeling does not
slumber. Open my prison doors and I will
bury your treachery in oblivion."</p>

<p>"Never!" replied Invective gloomily.</p>

<p>"Hear me," continued Tempest. "If in six
months of captivity I have curbed my spirit,
panting for activity, to patience, I should
scarcely with injurious precipitance have
warned you now of the disclosures I could
make. I should have watched my opportunity,
days and weeks and months to send forth
safely to the world the key to your infamy&mdash;but,
in truth, events are progressing which
renders my liberty invaluable, the time lost
here irretrievable. By restoring me to freedom
you will render me such a service, you
will confer upon humanity so great a boon

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

that I will forget your guilt and baseness in
my gratitude."</p>

<p>"No," said Invective Rabid, hoarsely, "it
would be madness not to crush you&mdash;you or
I must die," and with swelling veins and eyes,
across whose starting orbs there shot a bloody
film, he sprang upon the youth and seized his
throat in his gigantic hands.</p>

<p>Tempest, enfeebled by long privation and
captivity, had only time to utter one single
cry and might have yielded up the ghost,
almost without a struggle, in the iron grasp of
his ferocious assailant, if at that moment
Tempest's keeper had not entered, and rushed
not to secure the aggressor, but the victim.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir! he has flown upon you at last.
It is lucky you were such a lusty gentleman.
These mad people are never safe, especially
these very quiet ones; I trust, sir, it will be
a lesson to you."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Invective Rabid,
who rapidly perceiving the advantages of his

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

position, left the keeper securing Tempest in
a straitjacket, and proceeded to receive the
congratulations of the principal at his fortunate
escape from the sudden and murderous assault
of the maniac.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE SICK-BED.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, in the plenitude of his uninterrupted
prosperity, it was whispered that John Cash
had fallen ill. No one knew whether it was
apoplexy, or paralysis, or fever of the brain;
no one knew how or when he had been attacked&mdash;no
one connected with the millionary
even dared acknowledge his indisposition, and
yet the impression was universally prevalent
that he had been stricken by some dangerous
and sudden malady.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 53 -->

<p>The anxious countenances of Middleman
Cautious and of Lord Lofty, and the seclusion
of the Lady Calliro&euml;, who living beneath her
father-in-law's roof, and had not for three days
appeared in public, confirmed these rumours,
which speedily brought Sir Jasper and Eustatius
to the spot.</p>

<p>All access to the presumed patient was,
however, sternly denied the son, and the usual
means of communication were precluded by
the absence of Mrs. Cash, who having been
persuaded that he was consumptive, was rusticating
on a milk diet in a valley of the
Jura.</p>

<p>The intense and universal interest excited
by the ailments of an old man whom no one
loved, was neither unmixed nor unprecedented.
Sixty years before when men divined the imminent
dissolution of Austria's decrepit despotism;
one night passed in the sleeplessness
of disease by the Machiavelian minister, whose
arts still kept together its mouldering framework,

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

could often disturb, with the excitement
of hope, the slumbers of suffering millions.</p>

<p>Sixty years before, tens of thousands would
have heard, with profound anxiety, of the indisposition
of the French king, when the union
of France and England and the consequent
interests of civilisation were still supposed to
hinge upon his individual life.</p>

<p>The illness of old Cash occasioned a sensation
far more widely spread, and compounded
of the hopes which inspired the few, and of
the apprehensions which alarmed the many,
not that his friends were numerous&mdash;he had
none&mdash;he did not want any&mdash;he only sought
for partisans&mdash;but even those who were not so,
trembled at the prospect of his decease, because
partially acquainted with the Leviathan
capitalist's connexion with the local banks
and companies upon whose credit their own
was utterly dependent.</p>

<p>Everything, therefore&mdash;the eagerness of the
expectants who flocked around him, the forebodings

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

of the multitude, and the promptings
of Sir Jasper&mdash;combined to arouse the vigilance
of Eustatius, who, though repulsed from his
father's door, still remained, by the advice of
his political mentor, watching the progress of
events from hour to hour.</p>

<p>There existed an undoubted probability that
old Cash might disinherit his son, it was almost
certain that if he made any provision it
would be clogged with onerous conditions, but
Sir Jasper also suggested that it was possible
that he had not yet made any will, a supposition
which the anxious looks of Lord Lofty
seemed to confirm. Now, in either event,
it was urgent for the son to reach the death-bed
of his father, whether to prevent the use
of any tardy influence, if he had made no will
or if he had to step boldly into his father's
place.</p>

<p>Though Eustatius had been discouraged by
the peremptory denial he had met with, Sir
Jasper persisted in considering as feasible both

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

admission to his father and appropriation of his
otherwise testated property.</p>

<p>"But," argued Eustatius, "they look upon
me as the prodigal son. I am refused his door."</p>

<p>"Never mind, bide your time," replied Sir
Jasper, "when the danger becomes imminent
their firmness will soften into pliancy."</p>

<p>And so it proved. On the third day decisive
tidings reached the ex-minister, upon
which he urged Eustatius to act without delay.</p>

<p>He had, in fact, received intelligence from
Julia de Fougeres, who like the sea-bird seen
before a storm, only made her appearance before
each political crisis, ever mixed in the
tortuous intrigues preceding it.</p>

<p>She had gathered in the vicinity of the sick-bed,
that on the day in question no improvement
had taken place in the state of old Cash,
whose head was wandering; that Middleman
Cautious, wearied with the consecutive exertions
of eight and forty hours had retired overpowered
by sleep, and that the Lady Calliro&euml;

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

after incessant vigils had quitted the presence
of the patient.</p>

<p>This was the moment chosen by Sir Jasper
to urge Eustatius to a determined effort. A
few threats and promises adroitly made had
paved the way. "I am assured," said the
millionary's son, "that my father lies insensible.
Under these circumstances I am his
representative. I shall reward your faithful
adherence to his wishes, however unnatural, so
long as he had power to utter them, but beware!
I shall visit with severity all opposition
you prolong beyond."</p>

<p>With these words, overcoming the faint resistance
offered to him, Eustatius forced his
way through the irresolute guardians of his
father's privacy, now become doubtful whether
they were not thwarting their real master by
impeding him. From apartment to apartment
he thus reached the room in which his father
lay, and to which, yesterday, access might
have been deemed impossible.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 58 -->

<p>His entrance was still strictly forbidden by
the physicians of his father's household, themselves
refraining from intrusion into the
chamber of their patient, whose malady was
only irritated by the presence of any but those
he chose to call for, and on whom, for two
excellent reasons, they were equally chary of
imposing their remedies. The first because
old Cash would not have taken them: the
second, because being remunerated by munificent
pensions, which ceased with their patron's
life, that life was inestimably precious to them.</p>

<p>Now it had long since been observed that
your great doctors, who, in ordinary circumstances,
are great experimentalists, usually
leave everything to nature in cases personally
affecting themselves.</p>

<p>It is as rare for those professing the hygienic
art to take the medicines they scatter so profusely
in their practice, or to give them to
their families, as for a pastrycook to gorge
himself with his own comfits. The utmost

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

your acute practitioner will do is to palm them
off on a mother-in-law or a step-child, or a
scolding wife, though doctors' wives have a
preservative horror of their husbands' ware&mdash;but
if he falls ill himself he gathers round
him his medical friends, speculatively collects
their opinions on his case, and then&mdash;lets nature
take its course.</p>

<p>So the physicians of the millionary treated
him, mulcted as they were for every day of
illness, fined for every drop of medicine
they administered to him, and threatened with
the loss of their tempting pensions if he died.</p>

<p>Eustatius, however, set their remonstrances
at naught, and passed authoritatively into his
father's chamber, closing the door after him.</p>

<p>John Cash was alone. The Lady Calliro&euml;,
supposed by the household to be by his side,
had left him, as Sir Jasper had been informed,
and Eustatius sat down in the chair she had
quitted.</p>

<p>The old man having over-excited himself in

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

a long conversation with his daughter-in-law,
had lapsed into partial unconsciousness and incoherence,
not such as to render his ideas
wandering or disconnected, but sufficiently to
prevent him from distinguishing between the
thoughts he would otherwise have spoken or
concealed, or the persons to whom he would
have chosen to address them.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that he mistook the
husband for the wife, that he had not yet made
any testamentary disposition of his enormous
wealth, and that his mind was sadly harassed
at the thought either of making or neglecting
to make any.</p>

<p>If he died without a will Eustatius would
inherit and dissipate his substance; if the
guidance of his fortunes was confided to the
Lady Calliro&euml;, whose clear head and bold
heart were equal to the burthen of this greatness,
the transfer of his inheritance must be
made by a formal document, and that document

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

once signed gave her the greatest conceivable
interest in his death.</p>

<p>"Imagine," meditated the sick man, "how
horrible to know that from that hour the
young, ambitious heart of the only being who
tends and watches me, will be assailed by the
unceasing reflection, that nothing but the
breath of life in my old body keeps her from
the possession of the world; who every time
her glance rests on me will revel in the thought
of all that must be hers&mdash;if I died <i>then</i>&mdash;who
will grow to wonder when I shall die and to
wish that I were dead. Ah! when I was young
my brain I know would not have stood it&mdash;I
hate anything that gives our memory unrest&mdash;but
I should have succumbed to the temptation.
Oh! no; such thoughts will turn the milk in
a woman's breast to poison&mdash;better to let
a she-wolf tend my pillow; no, I will send for
my own wife. I will have Betsy by me, but
then Betsy will bring in Eustatius to my bed&mdash;Eustatius
urged by his ravenous parasites

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

and expectants, all hungering for my death;
Eustatius, whose unskilful hand will bend the
bow till it snaps asunder, whose feeble head will
never keep my possessions six months together.</p>

<p>"No, no, I cannot see scattered to the
winds that which I have collected with so
much pain. What a strange thing is death, that
it casts its untoward shadow darkening such
a destiny as mine, and threatening me whilst
yet sparing a wretched existence, whose
protraction is so disquieting to my own.
A blight menacing the maturity of the fruit
on the wide-spreading tree, and yet unscathing
to the sapling's growth, which sickens in its
shade and threatens to canker its majestic
roots. Why does it not strike <i>him</i> instead of
hovering over <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>Such were the notions which recurred, in
different shapes, again and again, to the old
man's troubled brain, though only expressed
by disjointed sentences, from which Eustatius
could gather nothing but that his father's will

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

was not yet made, and that when it was it
would be to his detriment.</p>

<p>After a brief pause, the chain of thought
into which John Cash had fallen brought him
back again to that point of his last conversation
with the Lady Calliro&euml; in which his overstrained
intellect had given way; and, gradually
recovering its coherence, he continued
where he had left off, stretching out his arm
and grasping in his horny palm the hand of
Eustatius, whom&mdash;in the darkened room, or
through the mist which the efforts of his vigorous
mind were only just dispelling&mdash;he obviously
mistook for the Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes! Middleman Cautious knows the
working machinery of my system&mdash;but not all&mdash;the
caitiff! I have never trusted him too far.
You, though you are but a woman, are mistress
of its hidden springs and secret principles.
All were together contained in this old head&mdash;in
safety too&mdash;though they have worn it out;
but then it might die with me, and I find, as I

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

have grown old, that we cannot bear that what
the mind has produced should perish with the
body.</p>

<p>"I believe it now&mdash;that no man capable of
creating aught that would live after him ever
could bear that thought. We live again in the
offspring of our brain. The author in his
works&mdash;the statesman in the power he leaves
even to political rivals&mdash;the miser in the
hoarded gold he bequeaths to thankless heirs so
that they do not dissipate it.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> will not let this be done. It was
necessary to trust some one. I am trusting
you. You have a clear head and an iron will&mdash;and
an ambitious heart; and you shall be
the old man's inheritress, but you must be quite
pitiless now I have told you all. Whilst he
lives we are never safe. I have broken through
envy, prejudice and pride&mdash;I have trampled on
combinations&mdash;I have scattered parties, I have
triumphed over the whole world's opposition,
I have raised an edifice of solid beams and

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

plated iron and brass, but that man is like a
cankering worm who maybe in the night is
eating into the heart of the strong oak, and
mouldering it unseen into powder. The other
was but a poor fool, and yet whilst he breathed
I felt that every hour he might turn the wheel
round, and send me back into the dust from
whence I started. I kept him safe for twenty
years; he was broken in mind by long confinement,
and yet he escaped from me even then&mdash;always
remember <i>that</i>. <i>He</i> flitted from me
to leave behind his dangerous spawn; the
youth has stepped into the place of the old
man, and I must quench the young man's
vigour, as I quelled the poison of the old. You
know that age has not made me credulous,
that sickness does not make me wander, when
I tell you that there are powers in nature
which the commonplace world recks not of&mdash;and
that these men are conversant with its horrible
secrets.</p>

<p>"I have heard, when I was one of the

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

people, that the body sympathetically feels the
outrage done to an amputated limb, and so
have I always felt by those men. Strange
warnings ever disturb me when they are working
evil. I cannot rest&mdash;I cannot cure&mdash;I
cannot live&mdash;I cannot die without hearing of
him&mdash;without knowing whether the foreboding
which agitates me now is a vision of the disordered
phantasy&mdash;a sick man's dream&mdash;or a
reality, and there is no one whom I dare to
send but you Calliro&euml;! You must see with
your own eyes that he is secure&mdash;you must
watch how confinement has affected him; you
must mark its ravages, whether on his cheek or
in his eye; whether it be the body or the
mind which has suffered, because on his condition
I must base my plans.</p>

<p>"Will you do all this, Calliro&euml;? Will you
go at once&mdash;will you peer into his face and
glance into his soul, will you tell me how he
fares&mdash;that youth who gives so much care to
my grey hairs, and whose image darkens the

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

visions of your future and my own? Go,
Calliro&euml;, you know the hospital for insane
patients which I founded so many years ago,
and have supported since&mdash;that hospital was
my state prison before you were born; in that
bastille he died; no, what am I saying? he did
not die but, fretting his energies away, spent
half a life there. No, what did I say? not he,
it was the other, <i>he</i> is my captive and you will
find him there. Ask for the principal, and in
John Cash's name, bid him admit you to his
patient, number twenty, letter T&mdash;that patient
is the disturber of our dreams. Do you
understand me? will you go Calliro&euml;? will
you remember number twenty, letter T?" and
after a pause which Eustatius dared not
break, he added, gasping for breath, and disengaging
his hand from that of his son, "but,
dear me, what am I doing? I have told you
all this before, but you will not forget number
twenty, letter T?"</p>

<p>With these words he turned upon his pillow,

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

and Eustatius, who found that the old man
still retained an alarming degree of consciousness
and who felt that he had surprised a
secret, stole to the door and made his exit.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">TEMPEST AND CALLIRO&Euml;.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tempest</span> had fallen asleep. His sleep was of
that feverish and unrefreshing kind, to which
nature's weakness yields, after the vigils of a
weary night, but in which it neither finds
oblivion nor repose.</p>

<p>He had been awakened from this slumber to
find his now uninterrupted solitude broken in
upon by a human visitant. A fair form rose
before his eyes; the musical accents of a soft
voice stole soothingly upon his ear, and just

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

as the world and all pertaining to it was
darkening into a hideous nightmare on his
soul, one of its most delicate creations, dispelling
the gloom of that contracted cell,
appeared before that lonely captive, whose
complete and susceptible organisation was so
eager in its appreciation of the beautiful in
whatever shape, recognizing that mysterious
identity in its physical and moral forms which
makes the heart respond to both, grieving to
find their attributes disunited, as if both recalled
some dimly remembered phase of
earlier being, or were instinctive of some time
to come in which they had been or were to
be inseparably united.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml;'s loveliness&mdash;light, rainbow-like
and ethereal enough to have characterised
the Alpine witch in Manfred, seen through
the mist of the torrent, or the moonlit shade of
Francesca appearing to the renegade on the
battlements of Corinth&mdash;was deeply impressed
upon the memory of Tempest in connexion

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

with gentle associations. He remembered her
beside the dying galvanist; he remembered
her when she sought to warm her perished
favourite on her bosom, and he recalled her the
sacrifice to a haughty man's ambition. It was
the Lady Calliro&euml;, whose apparition, breaking
the monotony of his solitude, had disturbed
his fitful slumbers now.</p>

<p>Their converse had been long and animated
and Tempest's faith at its close was shaken in
himself. Her words were full of mournful
gravity, her tones filled with a mixed respect
and pity. If she had doubted, if she had
ignored the superiority he felt within him, if
she had imperiously attempted to bear him
down, his resolution would have remained
unchanged&mdash;but, on the contrary, she had
divined the truth, she had acknowledged his
powers, and yet she came to persuade him
that he was persisting in an unequal contest
in which he must perish or submit.</p>

<p>"Your animosity against John Cash is

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

idle. I came from him, not to take advantage
of your obscurity, not to disavow your importance
in his eyes, but to point out to you
that there must be a vanquished, and a vanquisher
in every struggle; that there are struggles
in which the utter submission of the
vanquished alone can justify the forbearance
of the victor; to remind you that it is a part
as noble to succumb to an inevitable fate with
dignity, as to resist whilst resistance was yet
possible.</p>

<p>"The race is not always to the swift nor the
battle to the strong. Life has innumerable
missions; it is not those who have stolen the
largest share of the Promethean fire to whom
the guidance of their fellow men is assigned,
on the contrary, almost ever&mdash;chained to their
narrow rock&mdash;it has been their doom to pass
away, with nothing but the consciousness of
the appropriated flame they have imparted to
their race. It is one bent of genius makes
another, which applies the acquisitions in

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

which mankind glories. These may not mix
their attributions. We doubt not yours; we do
not call in question the powers you have inherited
or mastered; we do not deny the
benevolence of your intent; but it is enough
that these run counter to a system in whose
mighty vortex all interests, great or small, must
be absorbed. There are ten thousand in the
world who can criticise, or who could destroy,
for one who could remodel or who can construct&mdash;there
have been ten thousand schemers
who have dreamed, for one who could achieve.
You have but dreamed, and John Cash has
achieved&mdash;almost unlimited dominion. He
cannot yield to you, he cannot share it with
you, and he dares not despise you. Therefore
you must perish. Fortune, if it be only
fortune, has given you bound into his hand;
self-preservation prompts him to destroy; and
now, if like the conqueror whose upraised
sword spares when its stroke might smite, he
is merciful, has he not a right to ask that the

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

life he spares should never be turned against
him?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Tempest, "was the law of
old which made the bondsman. The victor
said, will you purchase life with servitude?
the vanquished accepted, lived, and was a
slave; but the imposition of that condition,
and the compliance with it&mdash;whence slavery
sprung&mdash;were alike derogatory to manhood, and
accursed."</p>

<p>"When slavery was the price of life; but
assuredly he to whom life, or even liberty, is
given may accept it on the condition of refrainance
from that which he could never have
done if deprived of either. The desire is implanted
in your heart of opposing him; the
conviction that it is a duty is rooted in your
mind, but fate renders this impossible. You
could but die, or linger in captivity, or madden
here, suffering an unknown martyrdom, and
that is sad to think upon for one so young, so
gifted, and so pure of purpose&mdash;why not therefore

<!-- vol 3 page 75 -->

renounce that which has become an idle
aspiration. It is not for your sake only that
I plead for you with yourself, but for my
own. I repudiate all suicidal weakness&mdash;the
waves must overwhelm the pebble, the unit
cannot be allowed to stay the mass&mdash;but I
should grieve&mdash;I should remember with remorse
and pain the extinction of so noble an
existence. If you had even the shadow of a
chance, you might be firm, but you have none,
and can be only wilful&mdash;for you have none.
Do you think that you have one&mdash;one single
chance?"</p>

<p>Tempest bowed his head in desponding acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Then why not abjure this barren hostility,
even if you will not be one of us; even if
too proud to carry out your views in subordination
to an irresistibly preponderating
system?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied Tempest, "that system

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

is <i>his</i> work, and because he is the incarnation
to humanity of all its evils."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Calliro&euml;. "What the purest
means could never have effected, the rudest
instrumentality accomplishes. The barbaric
impulses of superstition, vanity, the lust of
blood and gold have, perhaps, occasioned
throughout history the movements most beneficial
to mankind. The inordinate thirst for
power which knows no sating, but leads to its
unscrupulous appropriation at every cost, at
every sacrifice, is an ingredient indispensable in
the nature of all fated to remodel or reform
on a gigantic scale; it is part and parcel of that
instinct which, in its partial development, in
every age, when failing to inspire midway, has
made the tyrant. By its fruit not by its root
we must judge the tree. The most Godlike attribute of man is power, through ages
sparingly vouchsafed. The will, however pure,
is barren without it; and yet power, the author
of this system has achieved to an extent that

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

the world never saw before. Whatever be
its origin it is there a stupendous fact&mdash;it will
outlive him&mdash;it will pass to other hands&mdash;a
mighty instrument of good, incompatible in its
existence with your hostility, and hence inexorably
destructive of your being, if, without a
hope, you will oppose instead of yielding to
its supremacy."</p>

<p>"What," said Tempest, "can it be that
one so wise and gentle, whose looks, no less
than words speak her nobility of soul, pleads
for ill-gotten power against powerless purity of
purpose? Can it be that she holds it in higher
estimation?"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul I do!" replied Calliro&euml;,
boldly, "unbounded power, even misapplied, is
nearer to sublimity than good intentions never
to be fulfilled: a flash of thought, the conviction
of an hour may make one fructify, whilst
the will without the means must remain perpetually
barren."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Tempest, "it may be as you

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

say; my existence may be a mere worthless
unit destined to obscure extinction. It may be
that the germ of those great thoughts which stir
within me&mdash;the antagonistic impulse I obey&mdash;may
perish like a seed that rots away, but I
feel that it is in me, ready to expand if ever
it should see the light, and I will not sacrifice
its vitality."</p>

<p>"But if it be impossible that it can ever
see the light?"</p>

<p>"There are no impossibilities," replied
Tempest, "for those whose faith is firm. Even
if there be no fate, the wheel of fortune must
still contain some possible though widely improbable
prize; some chance, however remote,
if not one in a million&mdash;still a chance&mdash;must yet
be mine. Of this chance no power could deprive
me, even if the knife were descending on
my neck, and whilst this chance is mine I will
never abdicate my mission."</p>

<p>"Noble, but misguided nature!" said Calliro&euml;,
with emotion. "A dark, an irreconcilable

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

fatality impels us. Oh! do not obstinately
perish, listen to my prayer, oh! let these tears,
not such as woman weeps, persuade. There
are possibilities so remote that all but the
insane consider their converse certainties, and
the certainty for you is to wear out your
existence in these walls."</p>

<p>At this moment two shadows intervened
betwixt them and the light, the door had
turned upon its noiseless hinges; two figures
had glided in, and another darkened the threshold.
Sir Jasper and Eustatius stood before
them.</p>

<p>"This is a strange meeting," said Eustatius.
"I beg you all to note well the hour and circumstance.
You might well renounce a husband,
madam, and fly the gaieties of the great world
when you found compensation here."</p>

<p>"I must implore you to observe," said Sir
Jasper, "that I am an unwilling witness to
this discovery; I came only to see the calumny

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

made manifest which your presence here unhappily
has not disproved."</p>

<p>"As for your patient, Doctor Boniface,"
said Eustatius, addressing the principal, who
was very pale, and who had just heard that
John Cash was dead, "he follows me: I can
have no personal pique against the man who
enables me to rid myself of an unworthy wife&mdash;but
I must look to his freedom and his safety.
I must prove that he is not insane, and you
may count upon my countenance and protection."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">JOHN CASH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night had passed. It began to be reported
that John Cash was worse, and some
even hazarded a whisper that he was no more.
The funds did not fall because the millionary
was the only extensive fund-holder, but far
and wide all public business was tacitly suspended.
Groups gathered to converse on the
momentous topic, in streets and squares. Who
was his successor? Some bold spirits asserted
that be he whom he might they would not

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

submit to the same dictation from a young
man that they had endured, out of respect for
the deceased's grey hairs. Others now discovered
that they had always thought Eustatius
a most promising and public spirited youth,
and that he had been much ill-used by his
father. The print-sellers sold off every copy
of his engraved portrait in two hours, and
pleasing anecdotes of his private life appeared
in paragraphs of the morning papers. The
credit of Middleman Cautious went down
rapidly, and it began to be pretty generally
observed, that after all Sir Jasper was the
only living statesman.</p>

<p>By every train important arrivals took place
from every part of the United Monarchies, and
the capital would have been crowded with
political notabilities if velocity in railway
travelling had not been limited to the express
that carried government messengers and dispatches.
Whilst these trains came with the rapidity
of lightning, all others had been curtailed

<!-- vol 3 page 83 -->

to the most remunerative rates of speed, which
long experience had discovered to be the slowest
conceivable, short of standing still. Four
miles and a half an hour had therefore been
suggested by John Cash, who was chief proprietor
of all the lines, as the most profitable
rate of travelling, and it was pitched upon as
being on an average of a mile an hour beyond
the performance of pedestrians.</p>

<p>It is true, it was foreseen that this state of
things would resuscitate stage coaches, but
many parts of the old highways were in a high
state of cultivation, growing strips of wheat,
or planted with mangel wurzel, the horses had
to be bred, the coaches to be built, the capital
to be got together, and when all this was done
it was proposed by the companies to run fifteen
miles an hour, at low fares, for six months,
and so to crush all opposition.</p>

<p>One great advantage of this mode of travelling
was that carriages never ran off the rails,
that the engineers slept comfortably, and that

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

when the engine separated from the body of
the train, the passengers jumped out of the
carriages and pushed them till they overtook
and anchored them to the truant locomotive.
Accidents, in fact, were almost
unknown, except when the government expresses
came smashing over them, which was
pretty much every time they were expedited,
but that was not often, because John Cash
kept a sharp eye to the financial working of
the concern.</p>

<p>"He did not," he said, "dispatch diplomatists
as they had formerly been employed
to go from one court to another to ask what
o'clock it was, and his chief faith lay in the
electric telegraph."</p>

<p>It was, therefore, only those who had local
interest with the ruling powers, who had been
enabled to avail themselves of this rapid mode
of conveyance. Nevertheless even these were
considerable in number, and it may therefore
be readily imagined when the health of John

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

Cash was sufficiently interesting to make it
the theme of general conversation, and to draw
so many persons to the capital, what crowds
beset his dwelling. All enquiries as to the
progress of his malady were, however, baffled,
meeting only with the reply, "That he was
as well as could be expected," an answer
peculiarly unmeaning at his door, because one
he had always caused to be given when in
perfect health. They were forced, therefore,
to watch without for such signs as sooner or
later always evidence what is passing within
a tenement in which death is busy. Some of
them had been there from early dawn, but
hitherto without perceiving anything to guide
their conjectures, excepting that all was so
studiously regular in its external aspect, as to
be suspicious.</p>

<p>The hour arrived on which change opened, but
the chief characters, who figured in that arena,
instead of resorting thither now only remarked,
that "through that side door poor Cash

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

had been wont to issue as regularly as the
stroke of ten." And as they spoke the door
did open and John Cash, his umbrella under
arm, his step perhaps a little slower, and his
skin barely one tint more sallow, walked out
without noticing the astonished crowd, and
crossed the square, as usual, to the opposite
Exchange.</p>

<p>This was the manner in which the old man,
that morning recovered, blighted the combinations
of his enemies, silenced their machinations,
and restored the wavering loyalty of the
multitude.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">SIR JASPER AND EUSTATIUS.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Your</span> father is a strange man; who would
have thought that he would have rallied?"
asked Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>"Who indeed," replied Eustatius, gloomily.</p>

<p>"We shall all suffer for this premature attempt
to assert your just claims to your own."</p>

<p>"I knew he was better when I was again
refused admission to him. You have seen
him?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

<p>"I have just seen him. There is a sinister
expression about his eye which bodes mischief
to us all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Eustatius, "it would be
wisest for me to join my mother."</p>

<p>"She will be here to-night. You must
be of better cheer. If we have shown the
old man our cards, we have derived some
advantages from this untoward circumstance,
not least of which, perhaps is, that it will
force us into open collision. If on the one
hand he is on his guard against us, on the
other our position is strengthened by the prevalent
impression that he is breaking up, and
so I believe he is, if, as you assure me, his
shrewd and matter of fact brain is turning
superstitious."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of it," said Eustatius
"he babbles of mysterious agencies and strange
powers, from which his prosperity has been
derived, and which he now imagines to threaten
it, when we all know that he owes what he is to

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

the discovery of a specific for the murrain,
discovered as a quack stumbles on a vermifuge
powder."</p>

<p>"No, it was no ordinary capacity, no chance
discovery which founded such a power, even
though he be less well fitted than the son he
persecutes, to extend and adorn the fortunes
he has upreared," replied Sir Jasper. "But
he too has his weakness, has he?" and on this
reflection he began to muse, for the first light
of a novel and daring thought, which he did
not confide to Eustatius, was dawning in his
mind. At length he added. "But we must
act decisively, we can only threaten him
through the Lady Calliro&euml;; and we must make
him purchase your forbearance by his own."</p>

<p>"What of <i>that</i> Tempest?" asked Eustatius,
"is he safe? that was a great move of mine."</p>

<p>"He is safe&mdash;in the consciousness that his
security depends on our protection; there is
no fear that he will venture beyond the
shadow of our wing."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 90 -->

<p>"Let us only take care that he be not
tampered with," replied Eustatius, "what
have you made out of him? I have a notion
that he will prove a trump card in our hands."</p>

<p>"On what do you found his importance?"</p>

<p>"On the importance my father attaches to
his safe custody."</p>

<p>"There may be something in that," replied
Sir Jasper, "even if he only serve to prove
an hallucination. Hitherto I have not made
anything out of him; I have found him
mysterious and impracticable to a degree
suggestive that there was really nothing in
him. I shall try again, for it seems undoubted
that some strange connexion, which
we must solve, unites him to your wife's
family. It is well to bear in mind that this
youth I surprised in the park of Upland
Castle with the Lady Calliro&euml; on your marriage
eve, that this youth has been confined as
a lunatic by your father, and that we both
surprised your wife a visitant of his cell."</p>

<p>"I never knew of that rendezvous before

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

our union," replied Eustatius, whose vanity
was profoundly hurt by the allusion. "But
even if that unnatural woman were not her
husband's worst enemy and rival&mdash;and even if
she were guiltless, I have been outraged. Her
affections have been tampered with."</p>

<p>"Doubly outraged," added Sir Jasper,
"because she has besides allowed C&aelig;sar's
wife to be suspected."</p>

<p>"And therefore I will threaten, suspend
the blow, or mercilessly strike her as the occasion
may require. As for that wretched
youth, her victim or accomplice, or perhaps
both, I commit him into your hands to make
such uses of as you may devise, or, as he may
lend to, but, that done, you must remember,
that the instrument&mdash;however humble&mdash;of
my dishonour&mdash;even of such dishonour as a
calumnious imputation&mdash;must not be allowed
to go unscathed. Do you understand that, Sir
Jasper?"</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, with a few words of careless
acquiescence, quitted Eustatius to seek the

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

presence of Tempest, in pursuance of the
thought which has arisen in his mind, and
which his fears no less than his ambition
fostered.</p>

<p>"Was it probable," he thought, "that
John Cash would forgive him? was it probable
that with all the appliances of his power his
subtle patience would not eventually prevail?
Did not the safety of Sir Jasper lie in hardihood?
Would it be quite impossible to prove
old Cash himself insane? to make a bold
snatch at the reins of power&mdash;gathered into
a knot in the centralised despotism he had
established&mdash;and by a sudden and daring
stroke to shut him up in his own name, and
set his son up in his place?"</p>

<p>But when the ex-minister reached the retreat
he had provided for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he found
to his consternation that the youth had absconded,
though made aware that his description
as an escaped maniac was that morning
being published under the very windows of
his place of refuge.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 93 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE ALTERNATIVE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tempest</span> had deliberately quitted the asylum
offered him. The dress in which he had been
habited at the suggestion of Sir Jasper was
little calculated to attract attention, differing
so widely from that published in the description
of his person, as to divert all notice from
it. When after his long confinement he moved
abroad in the free air of heaven, amidst the
life and bustle of the great city, its animated
crowd no longer, as before, impressed him with
a sense of loneliness and solitude.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

<p>His lungs seemed to inhale, like a delicious
draught, the breeze which fanned his cheek,
and his eyes to repose with delight on the sunlit
scene, bright with the vivifying rays which
warmed the genial atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was one of those days which make the
spirits buoyant; and his mood was full of that
irrepressible hope which, quelling reason's
sombre suggestions, makes the surrounding
world a land of promise.</p>

<p>He felt that he was no longer a stranger in that
crowded city. Those passers by whose smiles
alone he noted, though ignorant of his person
and identity, were familiar with his thoughts.
They had devoured with avidity his glowing
pages, they had gloried in the depth of his
intellect, extolled the universality of his knowledge,
and responded by enthusiastic applause
to the bursts of his passionate eloquence, even
though delivered through the lips of another,
revering thus in him, by proxy, the champion of
their rights&mdash;the prophet of their destinies.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

<p>His own ingenuity and foresight had prepared
the indisputable proof of who and what
he was. He had but to enter the first place
of public entertainment, and point out the
singular revelation contained in all the works
and speeches of the popular hero, if the capital
letters heading every sentence were construed
into words. His listeners would disbelieve,
but undoubtedly at the same time seek to disprove
his words, and, struck by an apparent
coincidence, trace the formation of syllables
and sentences into a connected narrative,
prolonged, repeated and detailed till bearing
the irresistible impress of design and truth.</p>

<p>This truth and this identity established, the
allegation of insanity would be untenable
against him, and he would start into a notoriety
the more widely bruited, that his rise would
be into the place usurped by the popular champion,
 whilst at the same time a flagrant accusation
of the great enemy of the people's rights.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

<p>The ardent desire for action so long repressed
in barren inactivity; the oppression he
had endured, and the treachery he had met
with, had so far nursed the contentious instinct
natural to Tempest, that he would have rushed
with ferocious eagerness into such a strife
fearless of the result.</p>

<p>Such last night had been his impulse, and
therefore he had answered with indifference
the offers of the astute Sir Jasper, and parried
his insidious questions with disdain.</p>

<p>But with the night came this reflection&mdash;Tempest
in his cell had been induced to appeal
to the fears of Invective Rabid, because to him
the progress of the insect, whose development
he had witnessed for so many years, was always
discernible as an open book. He watched it in
his bread, he watched it in the water given to
slake his thirst, and he knew, that the fourth
and most dangerous stage of its transition was
approaching. In the first part of that stage he
judged that it was still possible for one man

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

with the appliances at his command, to destroy
its growth for ever, as so many things venomous
and dangerous may be destroyed in the
torpid state which precedes renewal of poison,
form or vigour; but that brief stage once passed,
its destructiveness might multiply beyond all
control even of him whose fortunes had been
founded on its ravages.</p>

<p>John Cash, whether gorged with spoil, or
touched with pity, or inspired with fear, might
still, if Tempest ventured into his presence,
be persuaded to forego his terrible prerogative.
But there was no time to lose.
The youth perceived, with horror, that another
day might occasion an irremediable transition
in the departed galvanist's creation. If therefore,
exposing his own wrongs to the world
he fought successfully through the long battle
of its disbelief&mdash;if he succeeded in impressing
it with true notions of the incredible responsibility
which John Cash had abused&mdash;if even
able, as with a trumpet's voice, to rouse and

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

array humanity against him, it would be too
late. He (Tempest) personally might step
into gigantic pre-eminence, but in what would
he then, founding his fortunes on the public
woe, be better than the selfish millionary?</p>

<p>At all risks Tempest, hazarding his immediate
safety, determined to seek out old
Cash. In pursuance of this resolution he had
eluded the protection sought to be imposed
upon him by Sir Jasper, though without illusion
as to the dangers of such a course, and
though rendered, by the temptations of the
smiling world around him, keenly sensitive to
the value of the freedom he was perilling.</p>

<p>In repairing to the millionary's dwelling,
urged by a sense of duty, the elation into which
his soul seemed ready to expand, was repressed
by the foreboding that he might be again cut
off from enjoyments of which he felt so much
reluctance now to forfeit the fruition.</p>

<p>Never had that scene, from which he was
hazarding perhaps eternal separation, seemed

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

so alluring to him; but nevertheless&mdash;without
slackening his step&mdash;without casting back even
one lingering look&mdash;he went his way till he
stood at his persecutor's door.</p>

<p>Access to John Cash, though in ordinary
circumstances less difficult than to most great
men, was not easy on the first day of his convalescence,
but Tempest was provided with a
means sure to attract the old man's attention,
if not to obtain admission to his presence.
Having delivered a letter, he patiently walked
up and down upon the footway.</p>

<p>Many minutes had not elapsed before several
attendants rushed out in all the hurry of pursuit,
and on learning that he was the person
who had left a missive for the minister, led
him into the mansion, simply acquainting him
that he had been sent for by Lord Lofty.</p>

<p>At this name a dark reminiscence crossed
the brain of Tempest. Filled with the conscious dignity of his mission, an expression of
pride, and almost of scorn, stole across his

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

countenance, as he prepared to encounter the
haughty magnate, whose former reception he
had not forgotten, and with whose political
tergiversation he had been made acquainted.</p>

<p>But a glance sufficed to show how much the
senator was changed. His brow was no longer
erect, his look no longer coldly arrogant, but
typical of the dejection of his class. No longer
the member of a powerful oligarchy, he had
sank into a courtier of the fortunes of another,
on whose forbearance he depended, and on
whose pleasure he throve.</p>

<p>Lord Lofty did not recognise Tempest.
Though his demeanor was still characterised by
a modified kind of hauteur&mdash;that of the dependent
anxious to assert his position rather
than of the proudly, self-complacent master&mdash;he
received the youth with respectful courtesy,
occasioned by the eagerness with which John
Cash had ordered that he should be overtaken
and ushered into his presence.</p>

<p>John Cash had returned from the politic

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

exhibition of his person in public. He had
been transacting business with Middleman
Cautious, the Lady Calliro&euml; was by his side,
and he was just receiving an impromptu deputation,
sent to convey to him the congratulations
of the Senate and Exchange, on his
sudden restoration to health. By his side were
two parcels of letters into which he piled
those handed to him, sorting some for immediate
perusal, for though it was said that he
could not read, it was certain that he could
acutely distinguish the handwriting of many
of his correspondents. But the thoughts of
the old man were far away from all these matters
to which he was attending. He could
neither calm his uneasiness nor conceal his
vexation. The escape of Tempest caused him
a profound anxiety, which all the measures
taken for his capture could not re-assure, and
his sharp glance wandered eagerly towards the
door in the hope that each intrusion would
convey some tidings of the fugitive.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

<p>And indeed, at that hour, so general was
the search for Tempest, that it would have
been difficult for him to have escaped detection
any where but in the unsuspected vicinity of
old Cash's dwelling.</p>

<p>The deputation had concluded its time-serving
address, to which John Cash made not
one of his habitually brief replies but&mdash;contrary
to his wont&mdash;a most ungracious answer.</p>

<p>"Senators, gentlemen and capitalists," replied 
the millionary, "receive my acknowledgments
for your good wishes, but in
future, before you waste my time and your own
in such congratulations, be good enough to
ascertain that there is occasion for them, and
wait till you hear from me, that I really have been
ill," as John Cash spoke he made a prince-like
bow of dismissal, and at that moment a letter was
put into his hand, for he would literally see
every letter addressed to him. He was about to
consign it to the pile of unknown epistles, when
a hieroglyphic on its corner caught his eye.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

<p>At this sight a singular change came over
the usually unchangeable features of the millionary,
on which even the traces of a dangerous
attack had scarce sufficed to make any
visible alteration; with an imperious gesture
he impatiently dismissed his company, and
then&mdash;even before he could utter the necessary
enquiries respecting the bearer of that epistle,
or issue fitting instructions for his detention&mdash;his
eyes became rivetted with an expression of
fear and wonder on the sign which had attracted
attention. Nothing could be apparently
more simple. It was only about three parts
of a ring drawn with a pen upon the superscription of the letter, but yet, for John Cash,
so full of strange and terrible import that his
lips quivered with agitation, as he glared
rather than looked into this unfinished circle,
devouring its proportions with his eyes, as if
for him it was the stamp of an irrevocable
doom.</p>

<p>And in truth to John Cash this mark was

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

preternaturally portentous, for to his superstition
the completion of that ring was significant
of the close of life or fortune. Twenty
years ago the old galvanist in his dungeon had
marked down the small segment of a circle,
bidding him beware of the meeting of its
points in that mysterious figure without beginning or end, which images eternity and
infinitude, and whose encompassed space all
human knowledge has hither to failed to
measure.*</p>

<p class="small">[*<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The posthumous papers, by which it appeared
that Colonel Sibthorpe had squared the
circle, were still undiscovered at that period (1907).]</p>

<p>John Cash, the unbelieving and strong-minded
man, might have laughed such a
conceit to scorn, had it not been that every
communication made by his victim, of which
time had stamped the mysterious accuracy,
was marked by this fatal segment, which grew
and grew for years&mdash;till at last John Cash
would note how far the curve had progressed

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

with as intense solicitude as if watching the
development of a serpent fated to devour him,
and until he started in his dreams affrighted by
the vision of that appalling circle.</p>

<p>Need it be said that it was Tempest's missive
whose envelope the millionary scanned with
such frightful eagerness.</p>

<p>A few, hasty orders given, when recovered
from his first surprise, brought Tempest, into
his presence. The old man, whose spirits rose.
with the reflection that the youth, at least
was in his power again, signed Lord Lofty to
retire, but beckoned the Lady Calliro&euml; to
remain.</p>

<p>With a firm but measured step, with the
mien grave and severe, of one who, impressed
with the peril he is braving, and yet with all
the enthusiastic elation, conscious advocacy of
mankind's interests could impart&mdash;Tempest
advanced up to the millionary.</p>

<p>The old man's glance had become again
cold, impassible and cruel. There was some

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

thing of the complacent, self-gratulation in his
look, with which the keeper of a menagerie
surveys some untameable and dangerous
animal restored to the safe durance of its
prison bars.</p>

<p>The ordinary salutations of courtesy would
have been a mockery between these men, but
there passed a glance of recognition betwixt
Tempest and the Lady Calliro&euml;, who could not
help regarding the apparition of the fugitive
with a strange interest, not unmixed with fear.
She remembered his irreconcilable enmity to
her house, and though less alarmed at his enlargement
than John Cash, the boldness of the
liberated captive in thus bearding his persecutor
in his den, augured the consciousness of
impunity or power which must be an inevitable
peril to their interests.</p>

<p>She did not share in the security which old
Cash felt when he found his victim once more
in the toils which had so long and safely circumscribed
the animosity both of Tempest and

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

of him from whom his knowledge had been derived.</p>

<p>"John Cash," said Tempest, fixing his
dark eye upon the millionary, "we know each
other. Your human hounds are tracking me;
no ordinary impulse leads me into your
presence."</p>

<p>"You are welcome," replied John Cash,
significantly, "we know each other. What
brings you here?"</p>

<p>"I come," said Tempest, "with a solemn
warning."</p>

<p>"Speak," answered the millionary, "but
since we know each other, do not waste words
as <i>he</i> did."</p>

<p>"I come not," said Tempest, "appealing
to your compassion, such words would fall like
rain upon the rock. The fount of all pity is
frozen in your soul. Even charity itself
could but gleam over its ice, like a moonbeam,
bright and cold, illumining its depth and not
dissolving it. But there, as in every human

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

breast, its liquid springs still flow beneath
the surface&mdash;hopelessly congealed at least
to all impulses of benevolence&mdash;but if
doubt or terror break through the frozen
crust&mdash;the genial ray may reach and quicken
that frigid current in your soul. I come
to plead for the interests of humanity against
my own and through your own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak on," replied John Cash, "as you
say the rock is more impressionable than I am.
On that immutable firmness I have reared my
fortunes. But deaf to sentiment and feeling, I
am quite accessible through fact and reason.
What have you to tell me?"</p>

<p>"This," answered Tempest, "that the
curse, on which you have founded your prosperity,
threatens to destroy it. As the insect
to which <i>he</i> gave birth, and endowed with his
own envenomed spirit grew to be <i>his</i> chastisement
so it may become yours. I told you
once that we should meet again, you confidently
answered me never, and then, if I

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

doubted whether we should meet, I believed
that it would never be except in fatal conflict.
yet I am here to avert the doom, so justly
merited so darkly overhanging you."</p>

<p>"Our enmity was your own choice," replied
old Cash, in nowise shaken, "I would have
served you."</p>

<p>"You would have made me the subaltern
accomplice of your usurpation, rewarding
my compliance with the merited treachery
by which <i>his</i> was paid."</p>

<p>"Well, that is past. We know each other,"
replied old Cash. "Why have you sought
me? Say on, remembering that threats unproved
fall idly on my ear."</p>

<p>"Not mine, when I speak solemnly upon
that theme," said Tempest. "And you may
judge whether I am earnest, if you reflect that
I was free, and by returning here come
like the bird into the fowler's net, like the
lamb into the tiger's den&mdash;without one struggle

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

for deliverance&mdash;the defenceless to the unpitying."</p>

<p>"If it be to menace evil that you come,
there is none that you can do me in your cell
that you could not at large."</p>

<p>"I come to avert evil."</p>

<p>"Why from me?"</p>

<p>"Because it can only reach you through
the calamities of that human family whose
sufferings have been your steps to power."</p>

<p>"The gain of one is another's loss," observed
John Cash. "What then?"</p>

<p>"His illegitimate gain!" answered Tempest.
"And in these no impostor, conqueror or false
priest has ever more largely traded. None
ever yet deserved a more tremendous doom. I
lived in the hope that it would have overtaken
you&mdash;I suffered in the belief that I
should be its instrument; but it seems otherwise
ordained. The most cruel tyrants have
been reserved to heal the wounds they
had made&mdash;to pacify the nations they had

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

affrighted; and so into your hands, John Cash,
and not into mine, fortune has placed the
remedy. Hear me! That terrible creation,
over whose ravages you only have hitherto,
of any human being, held control, sleeps now
in its harmless chrysalis. In that stage
it may still be destroyed, like the torpid
snake, or the ova of the locust crushed
by a peasant's spade, or vivified to desolate
provinces&mdash;but that stage past, its next
transition may be into a form baffling all
remedy, and calculated to progress with time
to an intensity of destructiveness which I am
gifted to foresee but not to measure.</p>

<p>"There is a sign, before which I know of
old that your lip quivered&mdash;the closing circle!
That circle marks the progress of the insect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said John Cash who had listened
with the most eager attention, as if inexpressibly
relieved&mdash;"<i>that</i> is the meaning of the
ring! All hail then to the progress of the
insect! The silk-worm has furnished kings

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

their robes, the shell-fish, it is said, has
raised up shores for monarchs to rule over,
but what are they to the insect of the murrain?
It has given me more of the world than
perhaps the world imagines. Let it weave
on its spell, let it complete its circle it can
but give me all."</p>

<p>"And what will that avail you with the
earth become a scene of ruin&mdash;when disease
and dissolution have made a desert of its surface,
and when&mdash;amidst this reck of its organic
life&mdash;you or your inheritor lie down to die
alone."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Lady Calliro&euml;, "I would
not inherit such a world."</p>

<p>"Labour is wealth. The earth untenanted
would be valueless," mused old Cash, "but
how prove to me that I should not lose by
annihilation of the insect?"</p>

<p>"Is it not evident," said Tempest, "that
you could gain nothing by its progress, if unable
to stay its destructive development?"</p>

<p>"Well, let it be proven," replied the millionary,

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

"that John Cash gains nothing and
loses anything by the murrain, and if it may
be it shall be removed."</p>

<p>"Great benefits are not conferred, atonements
are not made without some sacrifice,"
answered Tempest. "You must lavish your
influence, you must expend your wealth, you
must give the world your secret."</p>

<p>"What!" said John Cash, "and find the
world, in its anger and dismay, turn round and
strip off all my plumes like the jackdaw's borrowed
feathers?"</p>

<p>"You must hazard this," replied Tempest
"but you have no choice, the future bars you
your way unless you expiate the past."</p>

<p>The old man mused for a few seconds, and
then said,</p>

<p>"But when will the growth of the insect
become fatal? and how, prove to me, that it
will?"</p>

<p>"Thus;" answered Tempest, "I will open
to you the sources of my own knowledge. I

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

am not here to waste words, I know whom I
address&mdash;one who will not give up the substance
for the shadow, and so let us argue as
if facts were proven, holding the proof as indispensable.
Now hear me! I have staked my
destiny upon this interview, I must persuade
or perish, and therefore I will solve a doubt
which cruelly disquiets you. He to whose
manes be peace! did not bequeath to me his
secrets."</p>

<p>"None of his secrets?" said the millionary,
with mingled eagerness and incredulity.</p>

<p>"I am possessed," continued Tempest, "of
fragmentary portions of his knowledge, some
self-acquired, some imparted by him, but all
incomplete, all wanting in some link, like the
works of an intricate machine in which some
piece is wanting.</p>

<p>"If one had been vouchsafed to me in its
completion I should not be here as a suppliant
now, but gifted with the power of averting
that which I can but foresee, and sitting in

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

judgment on past guilt instead of denouncing
future evil!</p>

<p>"Yet even my foresight, accurately vague,
is limited though unerring. The history of
the insect has been bared to me like a volume,
which I have spelled through page by page,
even as the geologists discerned&mdash;recorded in
the earth's great book&mdash;in its leaves of rock,
and in its strata chapters&mdash;the progress and
decay of animated life through ages unsuspected.
From these past phases of the insect's
being I gather those to come, even as you
foresee the fall of autumn leaves, the bursting
of the buds in spring, and even as those who
read in the earth's surface can judge unerringly
in what serial order they should range&mdash;according
to the completeness of its organs&mdash;a
newly exhumed species, since every transition
of organic life has been an undeviating step in
the ascending scale of its perfection, from that
stage in which vegetable first passed into
animal organisation, when the star-fish started

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

into life, with plant-like root adhering to the
rock, down to the creation of man, who thinks,
transmits accumulating thought, and aspires
to encompass with his mind the mysteries of
the universe surrounding him.</p>

<p>"Yet geologic art assigns the place, but cannot
fix the time within a score of ages.&mdash;So
with my judgment of the insect. I know that
its next transition is imminent&mdash;I know that
with transition it will pass beyond control,
progressing to unlimited destructiveness; but
when and how rapidly is but a vague conjecture."</p>

<p>"You talked of my successor dying amongst
the wreck which it had made." said old Cash,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I cannot fix the time; it may be a year, it
may be half a century&mdash;I can but prophecy the
fact, I can but show you in its present form the
germ of organs, present, though undeveloped
like the limbs of the serpent tribes, like
the ostrich's wings, but hereafter destined

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

to bud into efficiency unboundedly destructive."</p>

<p>"Stay," said Calliro&euml;, "all you say may be
true, but you forget that according to its
<i>theory</i> the propagation of animal and insect
life must long since have devastated, and rendered barren,
earth and sea. The eagles must
have destroyed all fowl, the sharks all fish, the
locusts all vegetation. Yet it is not so."</p>

<p>"True," replied Tempest, "but the same
wise law which called them into existence to
keep down redundant life, preserving a due
equilibrium in its creations, limits, by countless
accidents the multiplication of these species. It
is not so with the <span class="smcap">insect</span>. A malevolent thought
presided at its birth, a misanthropic spirit gave
it being. No countervailing cause has been provided
to stay its ravages, save such as may
proceed from its creator man."</p>

<p>"Then the fact is," said old Cash knitting
his bushy brows according to his wont when
he jumped to a shrewd conclusion, "that the
murrain will desolate the world&mdash;that it is sure

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

to desolate the world, but that we know not
when. Therefore it is like Death. Now all
men know that they must die and come to
tenant a few feet of sod, yet who in that
thought gives up one ill-gotten acre? It comes
to this; that the murrain may at some time
remote ruin the world when I am its possessor, or
to the immediate certainty that I may stay the
murrain and be trampled upon by the world
I am trampling.</p>

<p>"There is no choice in such a matter. You
say, young man, that man has a mission, and you
speak truly, that mission's law&mdash;the first law of
creation&mdash;written in unmistakable characters in
every impulse of all animated being dictates
that according to our abilities and capacities
we should&mdash;" and here John Cash either dreading
to become rhetorical or slipping from his
stilts, added "that law dictates that we should
take care of number one. Let the world do
so, and John Cash will, I promise you!&mdash;What
have you to say further?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

<p>"A few words more," said Tempest, "and
if these fail I bow resigned to my despair.
Why appeal to a mere animal instinct&mdash;that
selfish instinct self-preservative, foreshadowed
in the protective thorns of insensate vegetation,
and which distinguishing animated life
first started into being when the crinoid
detached its stem from the bottom of the sea,
and from a plant became a star-fish?</p>

<p>"That instinct was a step in creation's progress,
even as the first vegetable organisation
was an advance beyond the combinations of
inorganic matter. But the principle of <span class="smcap">life</span>
was not the principle of <span class="smcap">thought</span> or <span class="smcap">soul</span> any
more than light is heat.</p>

<p>"Life&mdash;with its selfish instincts&mdash;teemed in
the early world when the shell-fish and the
corals made islands in its seas. It lingered in
the forms that writhed in its reeking slime&mdash;it
still animates the reptiles of the tropics, with
a tenacity and plentitude unknown to the
earth's more perfect organisms.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

<p>"Some of the most degraded of these were old
when the human race began; the toad has existed
ages in the rock, the severed worm, the divided polypus
live on, whilst life lasts but a
few brief years in man, extinguished by a blow
or dissipated by a thought!</p>

<p>"In man the principle of <span class="smcap">life</span> is blent
with that of <span class="smcap">soul</span> and secondary to it.</p>

<p>"In <i>him</i>, contend the instincts of inferior
states, with aspirations linking him to the
future, to constitute his part in that stupendous
drama, which&mdash;eternally progressing&mdash;has
passed into its third act.</p>

<p>"The law of its first phase was gravitation.
The second life and its development. Soul,
thought, and unbounded progress mark the third,
whose ministry is mankind's especial mission.</p>

<p>"An impulse, irresistible, rolls onwards,
mind and matter. All records of all things
chronicle their perfectibility. The burning
nebul&aelig; of chaotic stars condense into suns
and planets before our eyes throughout the

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

firmament. The lava and the mist cool
into earth and sea. The sea and earth give
birth to life, changing incessantly to forms
more perfect till, man adorns the scene. Man's
history is a like career of progress&mdash;a like
advancing tide whose partial waves recede,
whose mass of waters moves on steadily.</p>

<p>"He roamed the savage, or he toiled the
slave. He reared the conqueror's Babylonian
walls, the Egyptian Despot's Pyramid. Science,
art and freedom&mdash;freedom unshared beyond
the favoured race&mdash;dawned for exclusive Greece
and selfish Rome. The doctrines of christianity
were spread declaring all men free and
equal. Slavery became serf-dom. Ages of serf-dom
passed and slavery and serf-dom vanished.</p>

<p>"Science resumed its reign. Civilisation,&mdash;partially
checked, perpetually advancing&mdash;again
rolled onward the accumulating mass of
thought and knowledge,&mdash;never diminished,
indefinitely expanding in obedience to that
eternal law, which rules the universe&mdash;eternal

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

law which rules the universe&mdash;the
law of illimitable progress.</p>

<p>"Gravitation and heat were the early agents
of the change which that progression involves,
organic life the next&mdash;strata of shells, the fossil
wreck of forests, next changed the earth's
surface&mdash;and the last was thought, to man confided,
and woe to him if he ignore his mission!
woe to him if&mdash;neglecting the spiritual aspirations
which disquiet or impel individual man
and his collective race&mdash;he look back to
the mere animal instincts of his being, as
you, John Cash, are looking backwards! Remember,
and remembering beware, how nature
punishes all transgression of her order with a
severity and promptitude proportioned to the
offence. Judge then what terrible chastisement
may visit so great a violation as you contemplate
of its first, sublimest law! and pause ere
you decide, for that violation will be irrevocable."</p>

<p>"Enough," replied John Cash, whom these
words troubled, but whom they did not move.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

<p>"Oh! hear him," said the Lady Calliro&euml;;
"something warns me that there is a fatal
wisdom in his words."</p>

<p>"No," said the millionary, "he can but
disturb, he never could persuade me. If it be
as he says&mdash;if to each there be assigned his
mission, each can but obey the impulses which
guide him in it. Mine are to doubt the most
plausible uncertainties, to grasp at tangible
realities, to acquire&mdash;to retain&mdash;and nothing
farther."</p>

<p>"Then," said Tempest with the proud look
of the militant Archangel, "whatever be my
doom I devote you to your fate. Henceforward
be your life a crime&mdash;your name and memory
a malediction!!"</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>One hour afterwards Tempest was again the
occupant of the asylum from which Eustatius
had released him. The principal was changed.
The door of a subterranean cell, more dark

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

and more secure than that which he had so
long tenanted, closed on him, with its iron
grating, of which John Cash took the key, observing
to the jailor in his captive's hearing:</p>

<p>"Remember, you are the trustee of this
poor maniac, and if I die before him you will
apply the interest of those funds to your own
uses until he should become sane or pass into
another's care."</p>

<p>"He never will," replied the jailor, who
had served in the police of the Bokharian
despot. "And if <i>he</i> dies, I am to understand
you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That then the capital of those funds becomes
the perquisite of him under whose charge
the patient may have died. You see all is
provided."</p>

<p>"It had need be," said the principal, "for
if, sickly as he is, he lives six months here, I
will forfeit the reward of all my care."</p>

<p>The outer door closed. Tempest was left
alone in darkness&mdash;with despair.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. CASH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we lead the reader back one half hour, just
as Tempest was entering the dwelling of the
millionary, Eustatius might have been seen
arm in arm with Invective Rabid on the opposite
side of the square. Both found their
account in the occasional parade of an
intimacy beneficial to the credit of Eustatius
for liberality, and to that of the Democratic
leader for respectability in the estimation of
the monied interests.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

<p>"After all we live in a free country, or we
do not," said Eustatius. "I have casually
discovered a glaring case of oppression, on the
part of that arbitrary old man, my father. I
can prove it, I am determined to expose it."</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied Invective, "then honour
to you my young Brutus! the case is reversed;
but what matter? the name fits, and Brutus
Cash will mark as the third Brutus. But
what is the story? What says Sir Jasper to
it? Is it a fine, sound, tangible case of intolerable
oppression?"</p>

<p>"You shall judge," replied Eustatius, "for
you shall hear; but I must first be assured
of your co-operation. The matter must be
pushed home to him at once and fearlessly.
Any timidity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Timidity!" echoed Invective with an
expression vauntingly ironical. "Do you
speak of timidity to me whom all seek to restrain
to prudence, to me who never bowed to
man, or fortune, who have not only defied

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

your father's power, but faced the tedium of
his speeches&mdash;to me who would assail the arch
fiend without blenching?"</p>

<p>At this moment a vision passed before the
eyes of the democratic leader, and a sound rang
in the ears of the millionary's son which prostrated
all the confidence of the one, and gave
wings to the feet of the other.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid remained, with tottering
knees and blanching cheek, speechless and
motionless, until his arm, upraised in seriocomic
adjuration, fell powerless by his side.
Eustatius, quitting him without comment
darted hastily away and disappeared down a
cross street. Invective Rabid had recognised
Tempest, entering the dwelling of old Cash,
and at the same instant there had been drawn
up suddenly in the square a state carriage,
from which burst&mdash;through the lungs of Mrs.
Cash, prominently discernible in it&mdash;a cry
of maternal solicitude, morally touching
perhaps, but so loud and inappropriate as to

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

be irresistibly ludicrous. Mrs. Cash, just arriving
from the railway station, had caught sight
of her son, whose attention she first sought to
attract by waving her handkerchief, and then
by calling out, regardless of the laughter of
the bystanders, his abbreviated name, in a
stentorian voice.</p>

<p>"He is gone!" said Mrs. Cash at length
with a sigh, "the footmen will never overtake
him. Drat them! If Tat has cotton in his
ears, they must have lead in their heels&mdash;and
to think that I have hired them for their
calves too! They could not run slower if they
were spindle shaped."</p>

<p>"He could not hear you madam!" said
Smithers.</p>

<p>"I wish I could say as much," said the
Lady Bountiful Straightlace, the third occupant
of the vehicle, still pressing her ears with
her open hands, as people do in a vicinity
deafeningly sonorous, "At any rate if he
could he would not."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

<p>Mrs. Cash sighed again at this remark which
confirmed her own suspicions? and then a
consolatory thought suggested itself. "After
all," said the old lady, "he may not have
heard me, for though I did try to sing out, we
should not forget that I have weak lungs
now."</p>

<p>"Weak lungs!" echoed the Lady Straightlace.</p>

<p>"To be sure; isn't that my disorder, and
haven't they been tried by the telescope," replied
Mrs. Cash angrily, for she would sooner
have endured a doubt of her virtue than of her
ailments.</p>

<p>Here the wife of the millionary turned
wrathfully upon Smithers, who, putting her
hand to her forehead, was making telegraphic
signs, which the vexed spirit of her mistress
obviously misunderstood.</p>

<p>"If some people," said Mrs. Cash, "affect
to be as tender as young rabbits about the ears,
it is no reason why you should impertinently

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

pretend that your head aches as well as their
ears. You should not forget that I pay you,
that you are my menial, as Tat says, and that
I don't pay them, though they do travel at my
expense, and though I do pay for their
charities."</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Cash, calm your irritability,"
said the Lady Bountiful Straightlace, "it is
unchristianlike, unbecoming, sinful, and it
gives wrinkles. That young person is under
an impression which, had it not been for your
positive assertion to the contrary, I should
have shared, though God knows I am not
prone to suspect the artifices of the toilet,
since humbly content with the gifts of my
creator, I never wore the hair or teeth of
another."</p>

<p>This assurance on the part of the Lady
Straightlace was needless because her mouth
resembled that of a shark given to the use of
the quid, and because her hair was of that hue
with which neither wig makers nor time ever

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

appear to meddle, and which is therefore never
either false or changing, perhaps because it
could but benefit by any change.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Mrs. Cash;
"do you think I ever wore any but my own
hair or teeth?"</p>

<p>"He! he!" simpered the Lady Straightlace
maliciously, "I cannot so far forget myself as
to doubt the declaration of a lady; but if it were
not for that fact, I should say that the front of
your head-dress is displaced, showing a white
stubble underneath it."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Cash, "my wig is
awry, why couldn't you call things by their
names, and tell me so?"</p>

<p>"What after I had heard you protest that
you never wore any but your own locks?"</p>

<p>"And are they not <i>my own</i>, haven't I <i>paid
for them</i>. Do you think I would have hair
or teeth on credit, or borrow them?" asked
Mrs. Cash, triumphantly, "not that I am unmindful

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

of what is due to the graces of my
gender."</p>

<p>"Your sex, madam," suggested Smithers.</p>

<p>"You corrected me when I said sex this
morning," replied Mrs. Cash, tartly.</p>

<p>"That was because you applied it to a
word."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Mrs. Cash.
"What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander. I have a notion that there is finding
fault for finding fault sake."</p>

<p>This discussion was terminated by the return
of one of the footmen, who having overtaken
Eustatius, was desired to acquaint his mistress
that her son would be with her in an hour, and
that John Cash was so far recovered that he
had that morning been upon change.</p>

<p>"Well! he has been coming the old soldier
over me," exclaimed Mrs. Cash. "I never
knew him do such a thing before since I put
my neck into one halter and offered up my
hand, and heart upon another!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

<p>"Did we not tell you that all would be
well," ventured Smithers, who saw the face of
her patroness brightening. "Have we not
been prophets?"</p>

<p>"Profits!" said Mrs. Cash, "very small
profits, if any, seeing that my lady there has
snored, and that you have contradicted me the
whole way, and that I have paid the piper. No,
I cannot say that you have been profits at all.
I never object to profits, however small, in
fact small profits and quick returns was once
my maxim. But, as you say, Smithers, we
must not forget that we belong to the <i>bow-sex</i>&mdash;at
least I suppose we do, though bows are
out of fashion&mdash;and that therefore we should
make ourselves at all times as pleasant as we
can. I have an hour to spare, we have come
a long way together, so your ladyship must
take a snack with me. Smithers will step on
before and see that it is snugly and speedily
prepared."</p>

<p>"Where will you please to take your repast?"
said Smithers.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

<p>"Suppose we say that room newly fitted
with the tapestry, in which what's-his-name
addresses his army."</p>

<p>"In which Napoleon points to the Pyramids
and says to his host. 'From the summits of
those pyramids forty centuries look down upon
you.' "</p>

<p>"Aye, I remember;" continued Mrs. Cash
"from the summit of those Pyramids forty
sentries look down upon you! but it is
like that painting in which Diogenes is represented
in his tub, with the lid shut down upon
him, for if the sentries are there they are on
the other side of the Pyramid."</p>

<p>"Might I venture to suggest that the
tapestried gallery is not the best fitted."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Mrs. Cash. "I am determined
to convert one of them into a dining
room; every one says that they are peculiarly
well suited for it. They have been nicknamed
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never!"&mdash;said Smithers.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

<p>"Oh! you never&mdash;" continued Mrs. Cash
"You never heard them called the gobbling
rooms, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Smithers&mdash;a part of whose
sad penance it was to maintain imperturbable
gravity&mdash;mildly, and as if venturing on a bold
and questionable hypothesis, "but that <i>might</i>
also be from 'Gobelines,' the place where
the tapestry was manufactured."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">THE VICTIM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dreariest hour in the captive's solitude,&mdash;when
the mouse leaps out of his bitter loaf,
when the tadpole and the leech from his dungeon
moat defile the water he raises to his
fevered lips&mdash;when, motionless with sickness, he
dreads the tooth and feels the cold feet of the
carnivorous rat patter over his forehead&mdash;when
the rude hand of the jailor has crushed the beetle
or the spider grown tame from long companionship,
or rooted out the lonely plant whose growth

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

he had learned lovingly to watch&mdash;is nothing
to that of his first restoration to the cell from
which he has been suffered to emerge, after
long confinement, to breathe the pure air
of heaven, and dream that he was free.</p>

<p>Hope&mdash;where the future is hopeful,&mdash;withers
in the most sanguine breast. What, therefore,
must have been the desolating thoughts of
Tempest pent in that living sepulchre without
a chance of egress, and without one prospective
ray to illumine the despair of that dank dark
dungeon's night?</p>

<p>There was nothing to relieve but everything
to sharpen his anguish. The very thought
that his sufferings were unmerited added to
their poignancy. He was not even in the
situation of those who though still clinging to
existence, with the tenacious instinct of the
love of life, have yet been in some measure
sated with its experiences. Tempest&mdash;without
the consciousness of having lived&mdash;without the
memories and regrets which satisfy the soul

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

they sadden&mdash;was arrested on the threshold of
the world that wooed him, withheld from
the fruition of untried delights which disappointment
had not leavened, and consigned to
the oblivion of the grave&mdash;an artificial grave,
without the repose, and divested of the hopes,
of that in which outworn humanity finds
refuge.</p>

<p>The night and day were one in his gloomy
prison; but though he made no effort to mark
the time&mdash;for what was time to him?&mdash;it became
evident that a night or day at least had
elapsed without the appearance of the jailor
to bring him food or drink.</p>

<p>Then his growing thirst began painfully
to mark the hours, and the horrible suspicion
flashed across his mind, that he was devoted
by his present guardian to a death of
famine.</p>

<p>After long repeated and exhausted cries he
relapsed into silence. The last chance vanished
that, accidentally forgotten, his voice might still

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

have been heard. If murder were designed who
would heed the shout of the supposed maniac?
why therefore longer rouse the echoes of those
unpitying walls?</p>

<p>He sat down; a cold shudder crept over
him. The sensations he experienced were
those of one buried in a trance when awakening
in the coffin. The very air seemed close
and suffocating. He gasped for breath. All
the distinctive horrors of death by starvation,
he had ever heard or read of, came crowding
on his harrowed memory. The gnawing pang,&mdash;the
acute despair&mdash;the wolfish howl, the longings
of the cannibal&mdash;were vividly present in his
thoughts. Imagination conjured up the draught
of blood from the sufferer's own veins&mdash;the
long delirium, the wasted frame, the afterwards
discovered skeleton whose fingers gnawed and
horrible contortion argue the unspeakable agonies
of vitality thus departing.</p>

<p>The maddening contemplation of such a death
was almost enough to urge the victim of it to

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

dash out his brains against the walls. Yet this
was the death to which his connexion with the
galvanist had led&mdash;from which the galvanist
might have saved&mdash;him. The death reserved
not for him alone, but perhaps for all mankind.</p>

<p>At this thought a curse inexpressibly bitter
gathered in his heart. He began to doubt the
justice of that Supreme Power whose abstinence
from all exceptional control over terrestrial
weal or woe, beyond that proceeding
from his primordial laws, he had once recognised
as distinctive of eternal wisdom.</p>

<p>There came a change but no relief in these
weird imaginings. The vivid promptings of
despair gave way to the dull monotony of
desolation and then succeeded to it.</p>

<p>At length, rather a mechanical instinct than
a hope, urged the captive to try the walls and
fastenings of his cell.</p>

<p>Both seemed to mock his efforts. The wall
was solid stone, the door did not even respond

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

by a faint vibration to the most desperate concentration
of his strength.</p>

<p>But yet, so utter was the darkness, that he
had been obliged to explore, by the touch, the
sides and flooring of his cell, and as his finger
travelled over them he lighted on certain inequalities,
which he discerned to be characters
rudely graven on its surface. Was he awake
and sane, or was it the delusion of delirium?
those characters formed the name of his departed
master.</p>

<p>This then was the dungeon in which the
deceased galvanist had been for so many years
immured? Even here then there was hope so
long as there was life; but how long would
there still be life for Tempest?</p>

<p>Beside this name there was the date, beside
the date were other characters&mdash;innumerable
characters&mdash;the smoothness of the wall was
roughened by their multitude, the work of the
captive's dreary leisure. Deprived of writing implements,
he had made a note book of the stone

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

and scratched upon the wall whole passages of
his mind's history, in hieroglyphics unintelligible
to all but their inventor except to
Tempest, his initiated disciple.</p>

<p>Nothing but that insatiable thirst for knowledge
which had marked his early life, could
for a moment have diverted his thoughts from
the burning thirst, then throbbing in his veins
and husky in his throat. Once or twice he
essayed to read and then&mdash;with breathless
interest&mdash;he read on unmindful of his pain,
forgetful of his misery.</p>

<p>Hours passed and Tempest thought no
more of his thirst or of his despair.</p>

<p>His mind, if not his eyes, devoured this
unexpected record. That which he had longed
so ardently to know was here made manifest.
He followed step by step the process of his
predecessor's thoughts. One by one he discovered
and connected the missing links of
his own imperfect knowledge, till, by degrees,
the secrets of the galvanist were revealed.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

<p>Tempest had thus appropriated all the galvanist
had withheld. He had possessed himself
of more than his predecessor's power:
because gifted with the intellect to compass,
and with the energy to master weapons which
the old man had never dared to wield. The
youth was now, as he had so long dreamed,
lord of the grey-beard's spell! From the
exultation of absorbing thought he was at
last recalled to a sense of the stern reality.</p>

<p>If it were terrible to die before, Tempest felt
that to perish then would be to die a thousand
deaths&mdash;he was resolved to live. He willed it
with that energy of volition which overcomes
impossibilities. He tried the powers he
had mastered as a new fledged bird which
essays its wings, or as the blind restored will
sometimes open their eyes and glance at the
offended sun with rash impatience. Too reckless,
and unpractised, at every effort, he risked
annihilation from the fluids, which flashed and
roared like the summoned spirits, which howled

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

round the necromancer in old tales to tear him
into atoms at the first error in his incantation.</p>

<p>His cell&mdash;filled with a fitful brightness, whose
intensity increased or waned&mdash;was light as day.
His glance could pierce not alone the night of
his dark cell, but even the masonry of its
vaulted arch, with more clearness than a sun-ray
struggles through the mist. The figures
dim, the muffled sounds, the thoughts confused
of men&mdash;from whom walls of stone divided
him&mdash;dawned to his eyes and ears and apprehension,
and then, again one fault&mdash;in the
manipulation, his untutored hand practised
too daringly&mdash;left him a wholesome warning of
the destruction he had narrowly escaped, as
he lay stunned and prostrate in the darkness.</p>

<p>But Tempest was desperate if not utterly
fearless. He could but perish; starvation and
oblivion were within&mdash;the world and its renown
beyond&mdash;those walls.</p>

<p>With the convulsive energy which his overwrought
nerves permitted, he once more

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

gathered the subtle fluids round him. Like
a child disporting with the lightnings of the
thundering Jupiter, he made them flash and
play around his frail frame, which one error
in their management would have reduced to
ashes. Until at length&mdash;taking leave of life,
like one who tempts a desperate hazard, and
recommending his soul to God&mdash;he concentered
all his power, and made a final effort.</p>

<p>A shock was felt&mdash;an explosion heard&mdash;the
walls were shaken&mdash;the building rocked&mdash;the
lead poured in a cascade from the roof, the
molten iron of bolts and gates and bars ran in
a glowing stream&mdash;but Tempest was unharmed.
His prison doors were no longer. He walked
out. The millionth part of a hair's breadth
had made the difference for him between annihilation
and freedom!</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Half an hour before the principal had been

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

summoned to receive the bearer of an order of
admission from John Cash. His obsequious
obedience was increased on recognizing the
Lady Calliro&euml;, who armed with unlimited
authority desired that Tempest should be
brought before her. There was however a
trepidation in her manner which roused the
suspicions of the principal. He recalled how
the credulity of his predecessor had cost him
his office, and he had a vague idea that the
very detection of his capture was connected
with some love passage betwixt him and the
Lady Calliro&euml;.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, to detect whether
her authorisation was authentic, he boldly denied
all knowledge of the youth. The Lady
Calliro&euml; peremptorily commanded him to
usher her into the cell in which she had last
seen Tempest.</p>

<p>This cell was vacant. The principal, who
was now convinced, led her through the other
apartments, omitting all mention of the subterranean

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

dungeons: until finding the search
fruitless, the Lady Calliro&euml; retired, conscious of
having deceived old Cash, and compromised
herself in vain. She had hardly quitted, when
the chief of the establishment determined to
convey information to his patron of what had
happened. He was in the act of departing
when Tempest drew down the electric fluids
on the building, and as the captive passed
outwards through the last smoking corridor
he trod over a charred and shapeless mass,
which in its utter disfigurement it was difficult
to recognise even as a relic of humanity, much
less as the scorched, blackened, and blasted
body of the principal!</p>

<p>"Why!" said Tempest, "is the exercise of
power inseparable from violence&mdash;my first
step towards freedom homicidal?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">MYRRAH.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Myrrah</span>," said Invective Rabid. "You are
changed&mdash;you are becoming interrogative and
serious. You have grown almost dull. It is
not thus that you were wont to delight the
world. It is not thus that you made me an
object of its envy."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> changed," said Myrrah. "Once
I only prized the affections and the gifts of
men their fame or talents, as fit&mdash;when

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

offered up on folly's altar&mdash;to grace a woman's
triumph. But then I only dreamed a transitory
passion&mdash;a fleeting predilection, whose
ephemeral nature I knew, as surely as we
know that the sunshine, in whose rays we
bask, will soon decline.</p>

<p>"But you, Invective Rabid, have opened
a new and unknown chapter in my heart.
You have taught me the worship of a hero,
not for my sake but for his own. You have
inspired me with that ennobling affection
which refines, and elevates, and purifies, and
fills the soul! My thoughts, once only of
myself, are now all of you; my life is in your
glory, my pride in your success&mdash;my hope all
in your future. That is why I am changed.
That is why Myrrah is no longer Myrrah, and
yet all this you doubt&mdash;all this you disbelieve
from Myrrah's lips!"</p>

<p>"What matter whether I believe, so that I
love?" replied Invective.</p>

<p>Myrrah continued with a deep sigh.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

<p>"You doubt! but time will prove my
truth. I thought myself more&mdash;others, perhaps,
thought me less&mdash;than woman; yet I was neither
more nor less than woman, endowed with the
warm capacity to love, and liable to the longing
to love something with all enduring and
absorbing passion! This faculty, too tardily
awakened, has been roused, I know, when the
worshipper has become unworthy of the adoration.
From the vain idol men despised and
bowed to, I have grown to be the idolatress.
But my idolatry is an abstraction. It is not of
Invective Rabid but of the millions' champion,
of the name become a hope and blessing&mdash;of
the daring assailing him to whom the world
succumbs&mdash;and of the mighty mind to which
he quails&mdash;the mind, which in the elasticity of
its unbounded powers, stretches to compass all
it wills. You know that I have surrendered
all the vanities of a life, the freedom cherished
through it, the heart of my proud bosom, to
your fame. Flung recklessly beneath the

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

wheels of your triumphal car, what matter if
they pass over? what matter if they crush it?
what matter even if my worship remain for
ever unrequited? It will not the less endure.
Disbelief cannot chill&mdash;neglect cannot alienate
it."</p>

<p>"Come! come!" replied Invective, impatiently.
"Though you are the first actress in
the world, I feel that those lips, those eyes and
that swelling bosom are made to tremble, sparkle
and heave with unfeigned passion. I do not doubt
your love more than I doubt anything, more
than I believe or doubt my own existence, which
after all may be a dream. I have told you
that I love you, but I loved you better as you
were than as you are. Better as the frivolous
and joyous, than as the pensive Myrrah.
I was more proud of you thus, I could unbend
and revel in your reckless merriment, your
questions and solicitude only sadden me.'</p>

<p>"Well," said Myrrah, with a pang, "I
will be then as I was before. As I have often

<!-- vol 3 page 152 -->

done, you insist that your captive shall
figure with all her insignia in the pageant of
your triumph. It shall be as you wish. I will
throw open my halls, they shall stream again with
light and gold, they shall resound with mirth
and wit and melody, and since you disdain the
silent adoration of your votary I will be the
priestess of a dazzling temple, of which you
shall be the god. But first you must answer
me one question&mdash;one&mdash;and I will importune
no longer."</p>

<p>Invective Rabid gave a nod of impatient
acquiescence.</p>

<p>"You have an enemy&mdash;a dangerous enemy&mdash;one
who threatens your existence, or you,
the undaunted and the fate-defying, would
not have been shaken as you were yesterday."</p>

<p>"Myrrah!" replied Invective, "this is
a phantom of your brain."</p>

<p>"No," said Myrrah, "a reality oppressing
it. You cannot deceive me. I can read your
looks&mdash;and then in your troubled sleep you

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

spoke. It is not John Cash, your great opponent&mdash;it
is another, what other? how does
he threaten you? who is he who has set the
seal of anxiety upon that brow so prompt to
confront peril with defiance?"</p>

<p>"Listen," replied Invective, "I have deceived
you, and you are self-deceived. I have
nothing now to dread from the untoward
event which yesterday disturbed me. The
danger happily past is painful to recall."</p>

<p>"But something preys on your mind now."</p>

<p>"Not that by which yesterday it was
shaken; but you shall hear, Myrrah. This is
an eventful crisis. Old Cash is growing too
strong for us all. My fame, you will say,
rises with his power; but that fame is only the
vain breath of the people. If he were to strain
his authority against me they would clamour;
but I know them well, who would assist me to
resist? I shall soon live only by his sufferance,
like all who make common cause with me
against him. They are convinced of this; they

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

have concerted to assail him openly; yet they
are wavering now, the pitiful knaves, and if they
ail it will fare ill with us all. I am forced to
depend on others, not on myself; that is the
source of my anxieties."</p>

<p>"They are not unworthy of your undaunted
spirit," answered Myrrah, "but who hangs
back?"</p>

<p>"Every one," replied Invective. "They
are letting slip opportunities which never may
recur. The report of the old despot's death
made many prematurely compromise themselves.
The rumour prevalent of his failing
health still cramps his power. Oxford has rejected
his candidate, and passed a vote of censure
on him. The ecclesiastical courts set his
intimidation at defiance. Eustatius knows himself
disinherited. Sir Jasper knows that he is
lost, and yet they talk instead of acting."</p>

<p>"And how did they propose to act?"</p>

<p>"Overtly," replied Invective, "by attacking
the Lady Calliro&euml;, whom he has declared his

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

heir, and whose guilt if proven will debar her,
by the laws of the United Monarchies, from the
power of inheritance, as well as from all civil
right. You will not be sorry for that."</p>

<p>"Nor pleased," said Myrrah. "If she seduced
Julian from me, I have paid her back in
kind. I bear her no ill will. Once indeed I
might have laughed to see these prudish dames
unmasked&mdash;now I have other cares. But in
what will this result? If she be disinherited
he will find no lack of heirs from my former
footman upwards."</p>

<p>"It will result," replied Invective, "in our
ruin, unless our part is acted resolutely and
well. I can say no more to-day&mdash;you shall
know all to-morrow. To-night, Myrrah, perhaps
you may be able effectually to further
our views. If so will you assist us? Will
you assist <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"What is there you should ask and not
command of my devotion?" said Myrrah.</p>

<p>"This, if it be possible," said Invective.

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

"Entice Middleman Cautious to your house,
and detain him there for two hours from ten
till midnight."</p>

<p>"What!" said Myrrah. "Middleman Cautious!
Is he not my irreconcilable foe? Impossible!
You would not ask me that,
Invective?"</p>

<p>"I know," answered the Demagogue, "that
you extorted from the weakness of that austere
personage a declaration which hangs framed
and glazed in the gallery of your amorous
correspondence&mdash;but nevertheless, I believe
that you could tempt him. He has no grave
occupations at that hour."</p>

<p>"Invective!" said Myrrah, "That gallery
was the courtesan's. I was the first courtesan
in the world. I am now the mistress&mdash;the
unwedded wife&mdash;but the last, for she must be
the last to whom such a proposition is made."</p>

<p>"Myrrah, my brave and beautiful! you
misunderstand me. Have I erred in judging
you gifted with man's unscrupulous mind and

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

daring, arrayed in more than woman's beauty,
allied to more than woman's faith? Have I
erred in judging you a fit confidant of the
deeds of men? The truth is that my fame, my
honour, and my safety hang by what I ask you.
Answer me therefore this one question as you
love me; could you seduce him here if the salvation
of your soul depended on it?"</p>

<p>"To save my soul I would not&mdash;but I could&mdash;I
will to save your honour, to shield your person!"</p>

<p>"If so," said Invective, "and I have unlimited
faith in your powers of seduction and
fascination&mdash;if you can keep him here till midnight&mdash;or
till I send you in my ring&mdash;that may
occur which will give me to-morrow the place I
only seem to hold to-day. If you can do that,
Myrrah, a great danger will have been averted,
and our ambition will have taken a mighty
stride."</p>

<p>"Your ambition&mdash;to which I the courtesan
am devoted." said Myrrah mournfully. "It
shall be done."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">THE PREMONITION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John Cash</span>, even without doubting, would
not have been the man to trouble himself
about Tempest's prophecy. He believed its
fulfilment, at any rate, remote. With regard to
its eventual effect upon humanity he felt very
little more scruple than speculators usually do,
about the sufferings of those whose losses
constitute their gains. His mind, though
comprehensive, was limited in its foresight.
The idiosyncracy of his acquisitiveness was of

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

that kind which has led to the invention of
leasehold property, and ninety nine years
leases, and which, valuing possession beyond
mere life tenure, is careless of its transmission
further than a generation or two. He would
as soon have thought of troubling himself
about the exhaustion of the coal beds two
thousand years hence, as about the ravages of
the insect half a century afterwards. Nevertheless,
though this did not contribute to
disturb him, though the man whom he had so
much cause to dread was, as he believed, removed
from all possible antagonism for ever,
and though his absolute dominion was now
firmly established and widely spread, yet John
Cash was perplexed in spirit and ill at ease.</p>

<p>He had lived and laboured in the belief
that he should find peace when he had virtually
established that despotic authority, which he
thought to consolidate, by concealing it with
the tact, and administering it with the moderation

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

in which all preceding rulers had been
wanting.</p>

<p>He had perfected an occult but effective
mechanism, whose harmonious complication
of parts combined irresistible power with
noiseless facility of direction. The restlessness
of acquisition was over, the dread of
opposition had ceased, and yet he was further
than ever from the repose he coveted.</p>

<p>John Cash had attained that fatal experience
which succeeding to the anxieties of the
struggle for absolute and irresponsible power
disturbs the enjoyment of it.</p>

<p>The sword of Damocles hung suspended
over him. The thought that maddened Nero
into frenzy; the thought that darkened on
the soul of Cromwell when in the sullen gloom
of his old age he learned to regret the hazards
of the strife&mdash;that thought&mdash;the retributive
law which brands and punishes as blasphemy
against mankind free agency, the assumption

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

of unlimited authority&mdash;avenged humanity
upon the selfish millionary.</p>

<p>John Cash had acquired the terrible conviction
that since centering all power and property
in his person he had rendered his very
existence invidious to a hungering crowd, and
made his life and liberty the sole obstacles of
multitudinous ambitions. He felt as that
animal, which bears about it the perfume which
the hunter covets, is said to feel&mdash;conscious
that it exposed him to unceasing danger,
though nowise disposed to act like the hunted
beast, which traditionally casts away the cause
of its persecution to avert pursuit.</p>

<p>Though still collected in demeanor his glance
was sombre, his eyes bloodshot, and his teeth
occasionally clenched with an expression of
ferocious resolution once foreign to him. If
formerly unscrupulous he had not been cruel;
but his mood was changed.</p>

<p>The incessant suspicion that others were

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

hungering for his life, or seeking to compass
its extinction, gave birth to a vindictive feeling
in his bosom once coldly impassible to revengeful
impulses.</p>

<p>There is no animosity so fierce as that inspired
by the instinct of self-preservation.
Hence not unfrequently we find the coward,
or the man who has never harboured thought of
violence against another, roused when he has
thrust back from his throat the baffled knife to
a ferocity unknown to more daring or less
pacific natures.</p>

<p>This perhaps is the secret history of half the
monstrosities of the most cruel tyrants. Nero,
and Ivan the Terrible, and Robespierre lived
or died cravens. The fears and the anxieties
of John Cash must account for the morbid
jealousy which now obscured his judgment,
and for the incipient desire to make an example
of his foes, which sometimes rose like a bloody
film before his eyes.</p>

<p>He had come to the resolution that there

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

was no one living or dead whom he could
trust; no one to whom he could confide the
inheritance he should leave; no one to whom
he could commit the care of his own life.</p>

<p>His son was not alone unworthy of
being his inheritor, but John Cash was
upon the trace of a foul conspiracy concerted
by his own child against his person.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml;, in whom his confidence
and his affection had once centered, when estranged 
from their more legitimate object, was
now under the ban of his suspicion.</p>

<p>As he paced up and down the room in which
she was sitting, with that restless step that
indicates disease of mind, his glance fell upon
her with a keen and malevolent expression.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; herself had lost the
haughty fire that kindled in her dark blue
eyes, the colour that flushed in her proud cheek,&mdash;she
was pale and pensive now.</p>

<p>Old Cash found her as changed as those
rude men converted by the Galilean fishermen

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

from pride and violence to the law of peace.
The energy of her ambition which he once
viewed with alternate jealousy and complacence,
had given place to an avowed conviction
of the illegitimacy of his power and wealth.
Persuasive importunity had succeeded to her
once spirited adherence, and when her efforts
and her arguments had failed to move the old
man's grim resolution she had sank into desponding
silence.</p>

<p>The millionary thus found the rock upon
which he had built his hopes melt away like
an iceberg in the sun. "Her sympathies had
been estranged, her heart was confessedly
against him," thought John Cash, "why not
her hand?"</p>

<p>The first step of the old man, after the experience
of his last illness, had been in self
defence, to spread the report that his will was
made in the favour of his daughter-in-law.
This will was really made but not signed.</p>

<p>Eustatius had retaliated by threatening a

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

recriminatory suit against his wife. If the
Lady Calliro&euml; had still been, as before, a true
confidant and fearless partisan, John Cash
would have laughed that threat to scorn,
but now&mdash;even whilst he had caught a glimpse
of a darker premeditation, foreshadowed by
this attempt&mdash;and even whilst he was bent on
crushing the evil in the bud, by striking a
decisive blow against his son and those who
prompted him&mdash;yet this accusation suggested
strange suspicions in his mind, to which an
event, with which he had just been made
acquainted gave significance.</p>

<p>The fact of the Lady Calliro&euml; being surprised
in the cell of Tempest, the groundwork
of the threatened charge against her, John Cash
knew how to estimate at its proper value,
since he had dispatched her thither. The
allegation of a prior acquaintance and intimacy
was more mysterious; when he coupled with
her avowed conversion to Tempest's views,
and with her knowledge of the mortal hatred

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

between them, the attempt she had made to
penetrate to him, which had just come to his
knowledge. John Cash began to see in her
one leagued by some unaccountable sympathy
with his deadly enemy in a common cause
against him, in himself an intended victim,
beset by unnatural foes, conspiring against
his liberty and life in violation of the ties of
nature and of gratitude.</p>

<p>He was determined he would quell them
all, through whatever means he quenched their
opposition. As he paced to and fro his glance
fell with increasing irritation on his daughter.
He could no longer reach her through the
menace of alienating from her his promised
fortune, since she had confessed, not hastily
but placidly, her intent, if left to her, of
scattering it to the winds. Yet he was resolved
that she too should suffer, that she
should bow like the bruised reed that quivers
in the storm and moans in the blast it bends
to. His suspicions grew with reflection, his

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

cruelty and hatred strengthened with his fears,
until at length the thought suggested itself, of
giving up the Lady Calliro&euml; to the persecution
of her husband, who would not fail to cover
her with infamy. At all events&mdash;whether or
not&mdash;he afterwards interposed to shield her,
and why should he? he was determined to see
whether this prospect would not shake her
resolution, and he was about to acquaint her
with his intention, abruptly and brutally, as
one who fears that his will may still misgive
him, when a visitor was announced.</p>

<p>It was long past ten o'clock, and no ordinary
circumstance would have induced those of his
household whom it concerned to disturb his
privacy at that unseasonable time. The apparition
of Invective Rabid in the house of John
Cash, and at that hour, was a fact too remarkable
not to be communicated to the millionary,
or to be neglected by him.</p>

<p>He gave orders that Invective should be
admitted.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

<p>John Cash had never met the Democratic
leader except in the senate. He was used to
be the object of his denunciatory volubility;
he was accustomed to the irrepressible exultation
of his scorn and sarcasm, and
was therefore proportionably struck with the
anxiety which Invective's countenance betrayed.
There was no trace of the boastful
arrogance common to its expression; he looked
like a man come on a hasty errand of life and
death, and to whom life or death were not indifferent.
The Lady Calliro&euml; had retired; the
millionary beckoned his visitor to be seated.
Invective Rabid spoke briefly, earnestly, and
to the point. The tale which he unfolded confirmed
the anticipations to which his demeanor
had given rise, as to the serious purport of
his visit.</p>

<p>"John Cash was aware," he said, "that
though a strenuous political opponent, and
though banded against him with other sections
of the opposition, that with many of these he

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

had no sympathies of opinion, and that his
hostility to him had always been overt and
candid. He now lamented to have found that
those with whom he was leagued, in temporary
companionship, were resorting to tortuous intrigues
and meditating sinister projects at
which his loyalty so far revolted, that his conscience
would not permit him to have even a
political adversary unwarned."</p>

<p>John Cash, who listened with eager interest,
begged him to proceed. Invective hesitated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the old man, "you think
the information you can give worthy of some
reward, if so, speak candidly; though all the
world knows that I am liberal in recompensing
those who serve me."</p>

<p>"I am not to be bought and sold," replied
Invective, with offended pride.</p>

<p>"Then why do you come to bring me the
secrets of your party?" asked old Cash, so
keenly and suspiciously that it was evident
that he had no belief in the spontaneous candour

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

of his visitor. Invective was embarrassed
for a moment and then he answered:</p>

<p>"These secrets I have discovered; they were
not confided to me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed John Cash, who saw in
this rather a motive than an exculpation&mdash;"go
on."</p>

<p>"But," continued Invective, "if I am in
honour free to communicate these secrets, and
impelled by the loyalty of my disposition to
do so, I still think that I have a right to some
guarantee that I shall not thereby suffer. You
have not met me in a spirit of equable confidence
and frankness, and you will therefore
pardon me if I require some pledge both of
my own security and of your gratitude.</p>

<p>"The design against your person which I
propose to unfold to you, amounts to conspiracy
in the eye of the law; with such a pretext, in
your position, you have the power to strain the
law to any conceivable point, and I might find
myself constructively mixed up in the very

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

plot I had unmasked. This is an eventuality
which I do not suspect that you would bring
about, but against which I have a right to provide.
In the nefarious combination I allude
to, most of the personages of note in the United
Monarchies are concerned. Its object is to
declare you insane, and to shut you up in a
lunatic asylum. We all know how easily that
may be done. How the exhortations of a
sane man once beneath bolts and bars will be
disregarded, how&mdash;after one individual has rotted
in a maniac's dungeon with his obnoxious
secrets&mdash;he to whom chance has divulged it
may in a like manner be secured."</p>

<p>John Cash at these significant words turned
a penetrating glance upon the speaker, but
Invective Rabid continued.</p>

<p>"Now all I ask, before proceeding with my
tale, is a written acknowledgment that I have
forewarned you of this conspiracy. It will
be at once my security against being implicated

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

in it, and a formal title to your gratitude."</p>

<p>The millionary turned the matter over in
his mind. A suspicion of some other motive
flashed across it but he could discover none.
Invective was obstinate and so he consented,
simply adding,</p>

<p>"But I never write."</p>

<p>"No matter," replied Invective, "I will
write, you can append your name and seal,"
and further observing "that this document
would be in itself a revelation," he read
as he proceeded to indite the document in
question.</p>

<p>"I, John Cash, First lord of the Treasury
and President of the Council of the United
Monarchies, hereby acknowledge that Invective
Rabid, member of the united parliament,
has this day, between the hours of ten and
eleven p.m., made a solemn declaration to me,
that certain personages were treasonably and
feloniously conspiring against the authority,

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

constitutionally committed to my care, and to
deprive me of my personal liberty, my individual
rights and private property. I furthermore
acknowledge that I have been chiefly
indebted to the information with which he has
furnished me, for the means of frustrating
the designs of the persons undermentioned and
of bringing them to condign punishment."</p>

<p>Here followed the names of the conspirators.
Invective, looking keenly at John Cash,
hesitated before he read aloud the first upon
the list.</p>

<p>"Speak out," said the old man, "the first
bears my own name."</p>

<p>"The first <i>is</i> Eustatius Cash," replied Invective.</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to name Sir Jasper and
every personage of note in the opposition. As
each was mentioned the old man made a slight
inclination of the head as if to mark his attention,
and there rose to his lips a grim and
unnatural smile, so diabolically malicious that

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

even Invective shuddered. When this list
of proscription was done&mdash;for such the denunciation
of these names made it&mdash;John Cash
said quietly,</p>

<p>"Give me that document; but first, if you
have made one error, of the ninth part of a
syllable, in it, I will not sign it, you had therefore
better re-copy it at once."</p>

<p>"It is literally correct," replied Invective.</p>

<p>The old man peered alternately into the
face of Invective, and into the document before
him, with so much acuteness that though
he could not read one line of it, he could not have
been deceived, and then, having scratched his
name and appended his well known seal, he
sat down to listen attentively to the details of
the plot. Invective minutely narrated the
formation, progress and intentions of the
league against him; and old Cash, satisfied himself
of the demagogue's veracity and frankness,
by testing it through questions on points
of which secret intelligence had already been

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

conveyed to him&mdash;Invective further informed
him that, on the following night,
the conspirators were to come to a final
resolution, with which he promised to keep
the minister duly acquainted, meanwhile deprecating
any rash steps, which might arouse
suspicion, and demanding the means of private
access to John Cash at all hours of the night
and day, which was accorded.</p>

<p>When Invective took his departure he shook
hands cordially with the minister; and as he
grasped in his own his horny palm their eyes
met with a strange expression, which instinctively
conveyed to each the conviction, that
at some stage of the matter the other meant
to deceive him.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the millionary, as he
watched his visitor retiring. "I am forewarned
and if you deceive John Cash you
have only one left to deal with.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE CONFEDERATES.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was past eleven on a dark autumnal night.
The rain beat without, there was apparent
festivity within. But the light that streamed
through the windows of the mansion of Eustatius
did not shine on a mirthful banquet. A
few of the members of the opposition had been
that evening collected at the suggestion of Sir
Jasper, but it was evident that something had
damped the spirits of the party.</p>

<p>They had been ostensibly gathered together

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

to consider the best means of vindicating their
host's honour, by proceeding against his guilty
wife, in whose favour old Cash was said to have
disinherited his son. Sir Jasper had, however,
a few hours before, intimated privately to each
that a more momentous project would be discussed.</p>

<p>These personages who had expected to derive
confidence from the countenance of each
other, now they were united, served only to
depress each other, because there is a point at
which apprehension, like hope, becomes contagious.</p>

<p>To this conclave the Lady Floranthe, though
in the early days of her widowhood, had been
convened, and the Lady Sabina, her rival in
former pre-eminence and in present projects,
though her co-adjutress in those of Sir Jasper,
was also of the party.</p>

<p>Eustatius still flitted between the one and
the daughter of the other, and to these dames
the ex-minister had entrusted the care of inspiring

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

his political pupil with resolution to
repudiate his wife, till having compromised
them by that step he had proven the danger of
pausing there.</p>

<p>This was the text which Sir Jasper chose, to
exhort the company to decisive action, an
attempt in which he was frustrated through
the influence produced upon his hearers by the
irresolution of Eustatius, who when persuaded
of the peril of standing still, dumb&mdash;foundered
the ex-minister by threatening to escape at
once from the United Monarchies.</p>

<p>At length another of the initiated was admitted.
It was the Lady Sabina's husband,
fresh from the senate.</p>

<p>"What news?" said Sir Jasper. "Has
Middleman Cautious left the House?"</p>

<p>"Middleman Cautious quitted his place
some half hour ago," replied the senator.
"The debate was dull, the subject unimportant,
the leaders of the opposition absent."</p>

<p>At this reply Sir Jasper seemed to breathe

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

more freely, though there succeeded on his
features, an evident expression of intensely
anxious expectation, which recalled the agitation
felt when the explosion of the mine is
imminent, and which succeeds the satisfaction
elicited by the announcement of the lighting
of the train.</p>

<p>At this moment a vehicle dashed up furiously
to the door. The plot thickened; no doubt it
was Invective Rabid.</p>

<p>"You advocate procrastination; you propose delay," said the ex-minister addressing all
there assembled, "but did it never happen to
you, when shivering on the water's brink
you were pushed in by some friendly hand,
to thank the violence to which you owed the
involuntary plunge when afterwards disporting
in the stream?"</p>

<p>As he spoke Invective Rabid entered.
There was nothing remarkable in his appearance
at a political reunion of that nature,

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

though it might have excited some comment,
if its object had been purely social.</p>

<p>But when disregarding the courtesies of
polite life he pushed breathless past Eustatius
up to Sir Jasper, every one felt that there
was some strange augury in his presence.</p>

<p>They were not deceived. After conferring
for a few minutes in an earnest under tone
with Sir Jasper, the ex-minister requested
the company to draw their seats into a circle,
and spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"My friends. If there be one thing more
immediately concerning us than any other, and
in which an identity of interests should more
closely unite us, it should be the care of our common
safety. I have explained to you individually,
I have endeavoured to prove to you
collectively, that we have advanced so far in
the career of hostility towards the minister
that we have hopelessly incurred his enmity.
He or we must fall! Retreat is ruin&mdash;you

<!-- vol 3 page 181 -->

would have retreated, and for that vacillation
we have provided by placing retreat beyond
your power. You will at once agree with me
that we have no alternative but to act promptly,
when our colleague here has disclosed to you
what he has done and heard."</p>

<p>"Fellow citizens! or, I should say, gentlemen,
and indeed ladies," exclaimed Invective
Rabid glancing round him as he made a strong
effort to recover his composure. "Sir Jasper
says truly! By G&mdash;&mdash; we must sink or swim!"
here apologising for the expletive into which
he had betrayed himself, he continued. "We
have done for you what Warwick the king-tamer
did for his army when he slew his
steed; what Cortes did for his followers
when he fired his fleet. We have made retrogression
impossible. We were all convinced
before, that unless we soon shut up John
Cash he would put us all under lock and key&mdash;well&mdash;I
have placed you this night between
the necessity of securing his person within two

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

hours, and the certainty of being victimised by
him to-morrow. Do not be startled, I come
now from denouncing to him the intention we
have entertained in common, of depriving him,
as a madman, of his liberty and of his power."</p>

<p>At this announcement a cry of indignation
and surprise burst simultaneously from every
lip.</p>

<p>"You have not denounced <i>me?</i>" said Eustatius,
whose face was of an ashy whiteness.</p>

<p>"Your name is first upon the list. That's
all; you see that I don't deceive you;" replied
Invective, handing round, for the inspection
of the company, John Cash's formal recognition
of the denunciation he had made to him.</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated Eustatius, "we
are betrayed indeed! I must fly at once."</p>

<p>"Whither?" said Sir Jasper, "be calm.
Flight is impossible. You would be overtaken.
In two hours the telegraph will be at work."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Invective. "Do you see
these initials appended to each name, these are

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

the memoranda I have noted down of the
punishment to each apportioned by him. It
may suffice to point out that the most lenient
is a strict fulfilment of the <i>lex talionis</i>&mdash;perpetual
deprivation of that liberty, which we
meditated taking from him. You ladies are
not exempt from this prospective retribution."</p>

<p>"How should we be?" said the Lady
Floranthe, bitterly, "with his daughter-in-law
at his elbow."</p>

<p>"And what of me?" asked Eustatius
faintly.</p>

<p>"Nothing positive," replied Invective, "but
we know that in his present mood reflection
does not mitigate his resolution. He dwells
on the story of the Russian Tsar Peter and
of the unworthy son he put to death."</p>

<p>"To death!" murmured Eustatius.</p>

<p>"The suggestion of that heartless woman,"
said the Lady Sabina.</p>

<p>"Of the Lady Calliro&euml;, no doubt," observed
Sir Jasper. "She is an ambitious Sataness,

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

but if our courage fail us now we shall all be
at her mercy to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more true," added Invective
Rabid. "You see in Sir Jasper, the
surgeon who has probed the wound, in myself
the friendly instrument. You will be duly grateful
to us, in good time, no doubt, but meanwhile
we have brought you into a strait in
which you must conquer or succumb, in which
you must triumph with us this night or perish
with us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"There is in fact not one moment to be
lost, we must proceed to secure his person,"
said Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>"What now? From hence?" asked Eustatius.</p>

<p>"Without preparation!" said the Lady
Sabina's husband.</p>

<p>"Due preparation has been made," replied
Sir Jasper. "Middleman Cautious, the
true minister of this ministerial despot, has
been enticed away from the senate. John

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

Cash will not find him for two hours; he can
take no measures till then. Invective has led
him to believe the danger less pressing. Our
partisans, in and out of the house, are at
hand and ready. We must proceed from this
direct to the bed-side of John Cash, attack
his person and carry on the government in his
son's name. Possessed of the ministerial seal,
the finances, the telegraph, and all the paraphernalia
of authority, in half an hour we can
obtain the sanction of the senate. You will
be saved&mdash;the inheritance of Eustatius will
be rescued. But one hour hence it will be
too late. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"What a fearful emergency!" exclaimed
Eustatius.</p>

<p>"How force our way into his presence without
impediment and detection?" said the
Lady Sabina's husband.</p>

<p>"For that we have provided," replied Sir
Jasper.</p>

<p>"I have secured the means of direct access to

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

his chamber," added Invective Rabid. "Come!"</p>

<p>"It is a desperate venture," observed Eustatius,
still hesitating.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible alternative," added the Lady
Sabina.</p>

<p>"What is your filial heart compunctious?"
said Invective, tauntingly.</p>

<p>"Towards the father," hissed Sir Jasper in
his ear, "who is sitting now in judgment on
his own son."</p>

<p>"No," replied Eustatius. "But if we
fail?"</p>

<p>"If we fail in this attempt," said Invective,
"we shall be in the same condition as if we
neglect to make it&mdash;there is no denying
that."</p>

<p>"Come," said Sir Jasper, glancing at his
watch, "time flies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am but a woman," said the Lady
Floranthe, "but I will be one of you."</p>

<p>"I <i>would</i> be one of you," added the Lady
Sabina, resolutely, and appealing to her husband,

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

"if I were not a woman, a mother and
a wife."</p>

<p>"I am ready," said the husband, "and&mdash;I
and I," added others of the party, "so that
Eustatius joins us."</p>

<p>"Come," whispered the Lady Floranthe to
Eustatius, "one bold stroke for universal
dominion."</p>

<p>"Well," said Eustatius, "let us go."</p>

<p>"At once," said Invective, "where are our
hats and cloaks? Each minute lost after this
may be a link added to our chains."</p>

<p>"Stay," said Sir Jasper, "I have some
orders to give&mdash;and I am with you."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I shall call for wine. The
night is cold, my throat is fevered," said Eustatius,
unconscious of the implied contradiction.
Accordingly whilst Sir Jasper gave his
final instructions, wine was handed round, the
attendants retired, and Eustatius having filled
and rapidly drained his goblet, once, twice,

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

and thrice, offered the filled vessel in his agitation
to the Lady Floranthe.</p>

<p>She, accepting, raised it to her mouth and
touched the beverage with her lips. "I have
already drank success to your enterprise&mdash;this
is success to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>But as she returned the goblet to the giver it
fell from his trembling hand, and the crystal was
sonorously scattered into a thousand fragments,
on the mosaic hearthstone.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed this ominous mishap.
It was first interrupted by the Lady Floranthe
who said with feigned assurance:</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more propitious, the glass
was full&mdash;a noble libation on your own hearth
to your success."</p>

<p>At this moment Sir Jasper stood up in his
cloak and hat.</p>

<p>"Come! speed is success."</p>

<p>"Who doubts of success <i>against</i> the
tyrant <i>for</i> the people?" said Invective Rabid,
whose pugnacious spirit was roused by proximity

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

of the strife, of which the distant dangers
had appalled him. Without further hesitation
the conspirators rose; there was a convulsive
pressing of hands, a few interjectional remarks,
and then these men issued through the
armoury and down a private staircase out into
the dark night, on their momentous errand.</p>

<p>The Lady Floranthe and the Lady Sabina
were left alone in that lighted hall. The
rivals sat down opposite to each other, watching,
in breathless suspense and with intense
agitation the motion of the hands upon the
dial, and every faint sound audible from without, as they waited the development of an
event which must unite them in misfortune, or
strengthen their rivalry, by magnifying its
object.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE IDES OF MARCH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John Cash</span> sat brooding over the communication
made to him by Invective Rabid. The
more he reflected over it the more suspicious
he became of the intentions of his informant.
That very night he determined to surround
the parties implicated with an invisible network,
causing their every movement to be
watched and notified to him by his secret
agents. For this purpose he summoned Middleman
Cautious, to whom, by means of a

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

private telegraph, he could communicate his
orders at all hours. The answer immediately
returned was that Middleman Cautious had
left his place, but as John Cash knew that he
must come back to it, he took no further precautionary
step, but awaited his return.
Minute passed after minute, an hour
had elapsed. The old man had retired to bed,
but to watch and not to sleep. Indeed he
rarely slept now. At length, growing impatient
and uneasy at the protracted absence
of his agent, he was about to transmit the
order that he should be sent for, whithersoever
he had gone. But at this moment the stroke
of a small bell announced to him that some
one was approaching his chamber by the private
entrance.</p>

<p>He had no doubt that this was Middleman
Cautious. He touched a spring; the bar of
steel, that secured the door, sprung back, and
Invective Rabid entered.</p>

<p>"What <i>you</i> returned?" said the old man.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

<p>"In fulfilment of my promise," said Invective,
"to warn you at any hour of the night
or day; I come to acquaint you that the conspirators
have stolen a march upon us."</p>

<p>John Cash started up from his pillow.</p>

<p>"Stay," said Invective. "Don't be alarmed,
the peril is not so imminent, they meet to-morrow
at mid-day."</p>

<p>"No!" said the millionary, "they shall
never meet; but go on, what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Of that," replied Invective, "I cannot accurately
inform you, but I have one with me&mdash;a
woman&mdash;who can tell you all, but she insists
on personally stipulating her reward. Shall
I bring her in; she waits below."</p>

<p>"It is Julia de Fougeres," said the Millionary,
who felt his guess a conviction, "fetch
her to me."</p>

<p>Invective Rabid nodded affirmatively, and
then having cast a furtive glance around him,
retired.</p>

<p>John Cash had fallen into the snare and his

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

betrayer hastened to admit the confederates.</p>

<p>These&mdash;the initiated&mdash;were only nine in
number, though further assistance was within
calling.</p>

<p>The conspirators, muffled in their cloaks,
were drawn up beneath the shadow of the
wall upon the pavement, waiting in breathless
suspense for the return of Invective Rabid.</p>

<p>"What if he should not come back?" whispered
Eustatius, when the iron plated door
having closed upon the burly figure of the
democratic leader, the echo of his footsteps
died away in the silence of the night.</p>

<p>This remark expressing a simultaneous fear in
the breasts of those to whom it was addressed,
heightened their misgivings. The smallest
incident, a gust of wind, or the creaking of a
shutter might have changed this foreboding to
a panic.</p>

<p>"It is strange!" said Eustatius, after a few
minutes had elapsed, in a tone expressive of
profound alarm.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

<p>"Hush!" said Sir Jasper, grasping his arm
as in an iron vice, and as he spoke the door
opened and Invective appeared upon its
threshold.</p>

<p>The "all is right" which burst from his
lips, though appalling from its unnatural tone,
was a relief, if not re-assuring his auditors.</p>

<p>"The coast is clear. One solitary porter
dozes in his box; no other help is at hand.
The old man is alone&mdash;I have access to him.
Come, now or never!"</p>

<p>Sir Jasper stepped out into the lamp-light,
so that its glare should fall full upon him, and
waved his handkerchief aloft. At this signal
the tramp of men emerging from a street on
the other side of the square was audible, and
then turning to his companions, he proceeded
hastily to concert their plan of action.</p>

<p>"One of us," said Sir Jasper, "must guard
the door, the other keep the porter in check by
holding some weapon to his breast."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

<p>"I will stand at the door," said Eustatius,
unsheathing a dagger, for the confederates,
like true conspirators, were all armed to the
teeth.</p>

<p>"No!" said Invective Rabid, with a tremendous
oath, "you shall not shirk the
danger. You are our trump card, you must
be ready to our hand."</p>

<p>"Impossible, we cannot leave you behind,"
added Sir Jasper, "You must be upon
the spot, we must act by your orders under
this roof, become yours by the aberration of
your relative."</p>

<p>"Well then," said Eustatius, sullenly, "so
be it."</p>

<p>"I will go first," said Invective. "It is
possible that the porter may not perceive, and
if perceiving may not take umbrage at the
extent of my retinue. If so you had better all
follow me. Remember, gentlemen, that the
slightest hesitation will be our destruction,

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

that we shall retrace our steps through this
corridor as captives."&mdash;</p>

<p>"As captives or as captors," added Sir
Jasper. "We are convinced of that&mdash;now
onwards, and God speed us."</p>

<p>Invective led the way. Sir Jasper lingered
to bring up the rear, and the whole party
moved stealthily along the narrow passage.</p>

<p>The drowsy porter drew the wire that announced
in his master's chamber that some
one was approaching, but he made no comment
on the accompaniment of Invective. Knowing
him to have the pass and the double signal,
he was quite without suspicion, to say nothing
of his disbelief in the possibility of such
audacity. It was therefore only to testify his
own vigilance that he had drawn his bell a
second time, and this sign was responded to
by a sharp click, which Invective knew to be
the withdrawal of his door bolt by John
Cash, who this time did not wait for the preconcerted

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

knock, which was the sesame of
admission.</p>

<p>On its very threshold Eustatius paused.</p>

<p>"Courage!" said Invective, turning round.</p>

<p>"I will not go in," whispered Eustatius,
doggedly, "not till he is secured."</p>

<p>"Craven!" said Invective, drawing his
pistol.</p>

<p>"Stay, in God's name! What are you
doing? let us secure him!" said Sir Jasper,
throwing the door wide open as he spoke.</p>

<p>It was time. Alarmed by the sound of
voices outside. John Cash had jumped out of
bed. At this sight, Invective, divining his
intent, sprang forward, and at one bound
placed himself between the old man and the
alarum, of which in his previous survey of the
room he had noticed the position.</p>

<p>Thus intercepted John Cash made for the
door, but here two or three glittering daggers,
together with the figures of Sir Jasper and of
his followers in the background, arrested his

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

progress, and he retreated. A toilet table was
drawn across the only other door of his apartment.
The window looked down into the
square from an elevation of eighty feet, and
it could not readily be opened.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances&mdash;much to the
unjustifiable surprise of the confederates&mdash;since
there was nothing he could have done
which offered more plausible chances of escape&mdash;the
old man jumped nimbly into bed with
so much apparent sense of the impropriety of
his costume, as would have done credit to
Susannah surprised by the elders.</p>

<p>"What, what?" he asked, testily, as he
covered himself up with the bed clothes, "is
the cause of this unseasonable intrusion?"</p>

<p>Was it possible that John Cash could
seriously mistake the designs of his visitants?</p>

<p>At any rate the hostile nature of their intentions
was soon made manifest to him.
Without an answer, and in grim silence, seven
of the conspirators took up their position in

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

his chamber, and then Sir Jasper addressed
him.</p>

<p>"A painful duty brings us to your bed-side,
sir&mdash;a duty we owe to our country and ourselves."</p>

<p>"To come to the point," said Invective.
"Your race is run&mdash;your time is come old
man. You are our prisoner."</p>

<p>"Traitors and knaves," said John Cash,
"by what authority?"</p>

<p>"In the name of the people! and by the
right of the strongest&mdash;of which we happen
to be possessed just now," replied Invective
Rabid.</p>

<p>"On the authority of the senate and people
in consequence of your unhealthy state of
mind, and in virtue of the order of your next
of kin," said Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>"Ah! of the worthy child I have begotten!
Do you know, gentlemen, the penalty you
incur by stealing upon me so in the dead of
night like thieves? Do you know that I can

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

hang you all?" said John Cash, who, wishing
to gain time, would not appear to yield too
readily.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you had that power an
hour ago," replied Invective, "we are here to
deprive you of it."</p>

<p>"He speaks truly," said Sir Jasper. "All
parties in the state have combined to wrest
from you the authority you have abused.
Resistance is idle&mdash;you must resign yourself."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me after all?" said
the old man, half covering his face with the
bed clothes, like the ostrich which buries its
head in the sand.</p>

<p>"To speak plainly," said Invective, "we
are come to seize your person. We are here,
men of different opinions, banded in a desperate
enterprise. You may judge whether our
measures have been well concerted, whether
anything will shake our purpose."</p>

<p>"You must rise and follow us," said the
Lady Sabina's husband.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

<p>"Dead or alive," added Invective, "you
must come with us."</p>

<p>"This is harsh treatment, gentlemen&mdash;I
have served some of you I think. What
would you with me?"</p>

<p>"Convey you to a place of safety.
Whether above or below ground depends on
your own prudence," said Invective, "come,
rise!"</p>

<p>"Stay," said Sir Jasper, "we would wish
to execute mercifully and courteously, what
we have irrevocably devised. It lies in
your own power to soften the rigor of unavoidable
captivity and in some measure to
mould your future fate."</p>

<p>"We are wasting time," said one of the
conspirators, who had prepared a gag, manacles
and cords.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper waved his hand impatiently, and
continued.</p>

<p>"Your characteristic sense will, I doubt

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

not, bow to a necessity, painful I allow, but
unavoidable."</p>

<p>"What is your pleasure?" asked the old
man.</p>

<p>"This," answered Sir Jasper, "you must
transfer, by will, your worldly substance to
your son Eustatius."</p>

<p>"I will bequeath my curse to him!"</p>

<p>"Beware," said Sir Jasper, menacingly,
"and remember that we can act without that
document. Do you refuse?"</p>

<p>"I would not have treated you so, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Come, we are no children," said Invective,
"refuse or consent. Say yes or no."</p>

<p>"Stay," answered John Cash, in a tone
which might have been ironical or timorous,
"if my case is hopeless&mdash;anything to propitiate
your favour&mdash;anything to secure your
merciful forbearance, and to win for an old
man some little indulgence in the perpetual
durance to which you destine him&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

<p>"Only consider yourself politically dead,"
replied Sir Jasper, "and as I have said before,
to some extent you may weave out your own
future."</p>

<p>"If so," said old Cash, "do you see that
red portfolio&mdash;open it, you will find some
papers in it ready for my signature and sealed
already with my seal. They concern my son&mdash;read 
them, but let it be aloud."</p>

<p>Sir Jasper read. Was the old man demented?
Some of these documents were
warrants, on which the ink was scarce yet dry,
for the apprehension of all present that very
night. Others were orders for their condign
punishment at sunrise!</p>

<p>"So," said Sir Jasper, "this is a billet to
my address."</p>

<p>"You were to die," said John Cash, "I
admit it, but you will see that I had secured
you a public trial."</p>

<p>"<i>Afterwards!</i>" replied Sir Jasper, sarcastically.
"I thank you."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

<p>"And I," said Invective. "I was to have
been made safe without a trial, I thank you
for that unobtrusive favour."</p>

<p>"And I carried off to the mines to-morrow,
my property confiscated," said the Lady
Sabina's husband, "I thank you too."</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;and&mdash;I" added others of the confederates,
as they read the warrants which Sir
Jasper handed to them.</p>

<p>"But what is this," said the ex-minister,
"the order for a state funeral&mdash;the churches
to be hung with black for forty days of mourning,
the vault to be prepared&mdash;the coffin plate
got ready, with this inscription, 'Eustatius
Cash, born December the first 1870, died
October the ninth, 1907,' we are to-day the
eighth of October, gentlemen! This is horrible
indeed, this cold-blooded dooming of the son to
death by his own father."</p>

<p>At this moment a pistol shot thundered
through the corridor.</p>

<p>"Help at last," said John Cash, "you

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

asked me to sign something, gentlemen, hand
me those warrants," and as he spoke he sat
up in his bed, and flung from him the handle
of a signal rope, which he had been working
assiduously under the bed clothes, whilst conversing
with the confederates.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> quarters of an hour have elapsed
counted minute by minute, and second by second
by the slow ticking of the clock. Suspense
is become intolerable. The Lady Sabina,
and her companion and rival, start up with
simultaneous accord and hasten to the windows.
But these do not command the entrance
to the mansion, and there is no trace of any
movement in the solitary street they overlook.
They dare not even summon the domestics to

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

make enquiry, lest the circumstance of their
being left thus alone should arouse suspicion.
Minutes thus spent are days; hours, years; a
day, an age. A night of such anxieties does
the work of half a century, changing the human
hair to silver.</p>

<p>"Hush! is it a gust of wind or a mere
imagining? no they are voices in the distance&mdash;they
draw nearer, many clamouring voices&mdash;they
are beneath the window."</p>

<p>"Listen! what do they say? He is dead!"</p>

<p>"Merciful providence!" said the Lady Floranthe,
throwing up the sash, "who is dead?"
and then they first distinguish a voice singing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Old Care is dead,<br/>

We have drowned him in wine<br/>

And with him thought and sorrow<br/>

We have drowned him in bottles nine."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And then the chorus chiming in&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"But if he should rise from where he lies<br/>

We will drown him again to-morrow."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They are only revellers! They pass bye.
The sounds die away in the distance as they
came and all is silence.</p>

<p>A few more minutes pass.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear this," says the Lady Floranthe.</p>

<p>"It is indeed terrible, to think that one's
own children's future is at stake," observes
the Lady Sabina. "If it were not for one's
children I could not pass an hour so for an
empire."</p>

<p>"Something must be decided by this
time&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That clock has stopped."</p>

<p>"Hark! there are approaching footsteps&mdash;through
the armoury."</p>

<p>The door opens&mdash;it is the Lady Sabina's
husband. His face is pale, his clothes are torn

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

and gory, and the blood drops from his hand;
he tears past his wife and rushes to a seat.</p>

<p>"Where! how! is he secured&mdash;speak!
tell us the worst at once?"</p>

<p>"All is over!" replies the husband, but he
can utter no more: he has fainted.</p>

<p>"Good God, he bleeds!"</p>

<p>"We are lost! he is come back alone and
dying!" exclaims the Lady Floranthe clasping
her hands together, "all is over indeed."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now return to the chamber of John
Cash where we left the confederates panic
stricken at the report of a pistol in the corridor.
Invective Rabid was the first to fly to the door
of the ante-room, but in his terror Eustatius
had closed it.</p>

<p>A loud knocking was heard.</p>

<p>"You are my prisoners, wretched men,"
said John Cash&mdash;"there is the guard."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

<p>"Who is there?" asked several of the
party in a breath.</p>

<p>"It is I," said the voice of the ninth conspirator.
"I have shot the Cerberus. He
was escaping."</p>

<p>"The game is still our own if we are
speedy," said Invective. "Unhappy man, you
have sealed your doom."</p>

<p>"He must die," said Sir Jasper, now in a
state of febrile agitation.</p>

<p>"He or we," said Invective.</p>

<p>"Stay," said John Cash, "lay not hands upon
me or I will have you torn limb from limb&mdash;the
guard is there. I was summoning Middleman
Cautious whilst you spoke&mdash;he has
answered me."</p>

<p>"You lean on a broken reed," said Invective,
"Middleman Cautious is absent; he who
answered you is bought over."</p>

<p>"You lie!" exclaimed John Cash fiercely,
"as you lied to me to-night," but his fears

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

said otherwise, for he sprung suddenly from
his bed and towards the door.</p>

<p>Two pair of arms seized hold of him and
barred his passage, but his night garments gave
way, and leaving the fragments in their grasp
he retreated, and seizing up a chair, made for
the other door of his sleeping chamber, of
which he shook the panels, shrieking murder
in stentorian tones.</p>

<p>Female voices responded to this appeal, confounding
the conspirators and inspiring John
Cash with a momentary hope; but in an instant
he remembered that the Lady Calliro&euml;
and her women, whom his cries had roused,
had that night been securely locked in their
apartments, so that they might hold no communication
without, till he knew who was for,
and who against him.</p>

<p>Finding this, the old man turned to parley
with his assassins.</p>

<p>"What do you want? say what will satisfy
you&mdash;what would you have me do?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

<p>"Die!" hoarsely replied Invective. "All
compromise is incompatible with our own
safety."</p>

<p>"He must die! he must die!" said the
confederates with one accord.</p>

<p>The lights were suddenly extinguished, and
the gleam from the windows of an adjacent
wing now made a partial twilight in the darkness.
Again he roared out lustily murder,
and attempted to throw open the window.</p>

<p>"He must die!" repeated the conspirators,
and some one&mdash;it was impossible in the confusion
to say whom&mdash;added:</p>

<p>"But no steel, no fire-arms, no blood," and
at the same instant, a heavy blow on the forehead
with a boot-jack brought the old man to
the ground. They kneeled upon his prostrate
body, and in an instant the cord, which had
been prepared to bind him with, was tightened
round his neck. The old man struggled with
an energy more consonant with the vigour of
his character than with his years.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

<p>"Assassins! I will not sign&mdash;you shall never
have my gold. Stay! mercy on an old man!&mdash;not
my throat&mdash;a little air&mdash;you would not
strangle me? I am weak and aged. Oh!
murder, murder! gold for one breath of air!
Oh! millions&mdash;untold wealth, to save me&mdash;not
to let me die!"</p>

<p>"Stay!" said Invective Rabid, "this sickens
me. I had as lief perish myself. Shall I
let him go?"</p>

<p>"It is too late," said Sir Jasper, "we must
all die if he lives."</p>

<p>"Then," said Invective, "every man shall
pull at the rope, no one shall ever throw it in
the teeth of another or I will loosen him."</p>

<p>"Where is Eustatius?" asked some one.</p>

<p>"Where is Eustatius, the craven?" said
Invective.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" said Sir Jasper, dragging
him into the room, "he must participate in
this."</p>
<p>"Oh! let me go!" exclaimed the terrified
son of the millionary.</p>

<p>"Now by the God that made us," said Invective,
"you shall join in this work or I give
it over. If any one consents to trust him I
will. I am ready to loosen him now. Shall
I let him loose, Eustatius?"</p>

<p>"At the expense of your life and fortune and
of our common safety," said some tempter.</p>

<p>"No, no! no, it would be suicide&mdash;to-morrow
the ninth&mdash;my coffin-plate inscribed!"
replied Eustatius&mdash;who had heard every word
from without&mdash;in a paroxysm of terror.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Sir Jasper; "voices in the corridor!
we shall have no choice soon; we must
sell our lives dearly, or he must die."</p>

<p>These words determined the conspirators.
A scene of hideous confusion ensued in that
dim twilight. There was a scuffle&mdash;the
sound of blows with a blunt instrument,&mdash;oaths,
shrieks of murder and imprecations.
There were appeals to mercy not only from the

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

struggling victim, but in the tones of a seraphic
voice from without, which interceding for him
arrested for a moment but could not deter
the murderers.</p>

<p>There followed a fresh struggle, a piercing
cry&mdash;more blows, and then a solemn silence
succeeded to the death rattle.</p>

<p>John Cash was dead.</p>

<p>Not all the incalculable sums he had
hoarded&mdash;not all the wealth wrung from mankind's
necessity, not all the gold ever dug out
of the Mine could now for one brief second
restore to the departed soul the senseless clay.</p>

<p>But even then&mdash;when all was hushed but the
low breathing of the confederates, who, afraid
of their own voices, dared not ask whether he
had ceased to breathe&mdash;there still rang vividly
in the ears of the participators in that foul
deed&mdash;the dying man's malediction on his son&mdash;the
only distinctly remembered incident of
that appalling episode, become thenceforward a
perpetual night-mare of the memory.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

<p>John Cash had ceased to live, but he had
died hard. When light flashed over that ghastly
scene, part of his skull appeared to have been
beaten in, his glaring eyeballs were starting
from their sockets, his features were blackening.
Blood too was streaming over his face and had
clotted his grey hairs, but it was not his own.
In his agony he had bitten the hand of one of
his assailants to the bone.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid who had seized in his gigantic
palm the hand of Eustatius, still closed
on the extremity of rope coiled round the dead
man's neck, held it up that it might testify to
all present the share of the son in the violence
done to the father.</p>

<p>From the mangled remnant of humanity
before them, the assassins of the old man
turned to weaken their remorse by contemplation
of the parricide, beside whose crime
their own transgression was venial.</p>

<p>Of all who had shared in that dark deed,
not one had crossed the dead man's threshold

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

meditating murder&mdash;of all its perpetrators not
one had left that chamber without remorse and
horror, yet&mdash;conscience stricken as they were&mdash;there
was not one, who if the past could have
been revoked would have hesitated to enact
again the part he had played in that sad drama.
A little reflection will in fact demonstrate that
the dictates of self preservation forbade all
other course&mdash;that a fatal necessity impelled
them. To slay or to be slain was the horrible
alternative, which if the features of the case
could have been recalled must have urged them
to renew again their repented violence.</p>

<p>And yet, was that murder sinless? Did
those remains unfold no tale? did that disfigured
corpse give no dumb evidence of guilt?
And if so, upon whom shall it be charged? on
those who in obedience to a universal instinct
destroyed that they might not perish, or rather
upon him who&mdash;knowing that in all ages with
all men like circumstances have produced a like
result&mdash;forced upon those who slew him this

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

necessity? Reason gives the same answer in
the case of John Cash as in that of all others
who having attained irresponsible power drive
the victims of their homicidal suspicion to forestall
it by some act of despair. That guilt&mdash;the
guilt of his own blood must be upon his
head&mdash;as their blood upon their own.</p>

<p>It was thus that John Cash passed from the
world. It was thus that the world he had almost
spanned passed from John Cash unto his
next of kin.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>"Let us step into the shade," said Eustatius,
"I dread the glare of the lights&mdash;I dread to
meet any one. I shall never face the Senate&mdash;I
shall never hold up my head again."</p>

<p>"The Senate know nothing of it," replied Sir
Jasper. "Your father has died of apoplexy,
the porter has shot himself through grief
and despair at his master's death&mdash;a touching

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

instance of fidelity. The world knows nothing
beyond."</p>

<p>"But it will," said Eustatius, "murder
will out. I tell you I shall never hold up my
head again!"</p>

<p>"Child's talk?" replied Sir Jasper, "you forget
that you are possessed of his inheritance.
All men will soon have forgotten the lamentable
event to which you allude. It is not without
precedent. You have the death of the
Emperor Paul which almost incident for incident
resembles it. You have the example
of his sons Alexander and Nicholas. Did
not they prosper? were not they joyfully
received by a free people in its most canting
age? I tell you never fear. If your interests
oblige you to fulfill a thousand sterner duties,
you will never want for praise and flattery&mdash;you
will never want for a Phillips, who if he
cannot say that you are a good son, or show
that you are a merciful Prince, will find out
that you are an excellent father."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE SNARE.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Listen</span>!" said Myrrah clapping her hands
triumphantly. "It is midnight!" And at
this moment a maiden, fair as the morning,
brought her in, on a jewelled salver, a ring
which she placed upon her finger.</p>

<p>"Midnight. Enchantress! you annihilate
time!" exclaimed Middleman Cautious. "I
can stay no longer; I must begone; and yet
you have not revealed to me the promised
secret."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

<p>"Was it only that promise drew you hither?"</p>

<p>"I will not dissimulate," replied Middleman
gallantly. "It was rather the pretext than
the cause of my visit. There was a vision of
bright eyes more attractive than state secrets,
but nevertheless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has the hope of seeing it fulfilled detained
you here?"</p>

<p>"I must confess again," said Middleman,
"that I would rather have spent two such
hours at the price of forfeiting the most important
secret than two hours away from you
to secure it. But yet if you know aught concerning
the welfare of the state, as you have
assured me that you do&mdash;let me hear it now;
and believe me you will find a not thankless
confident."</p>

<p>"Midnight!" replied Myrrah looking at the
clock.</p>

<p>"You promised me that I should know
it before midnight. If there was nothing in
that promise,&mdash;if it was a mere stratagem&mdash;a

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

most needless stratagem&mdash;to attract me here,
say so, most beauteous Myrrah. But if that
confidence has been reposed in you by others
into which I feel that you could tempt me, so
easily, speak, for I must now tear myself away."</p>

<p>Middleman Cautious, in yielding to the request
for an immediate interview with Myrrah,
had been influenced by a double motive. He
felt that the ridicule with which she had covered
him by her publication of the amorous declaration
into which he had been formerly
inveigled, would be, in some measure,
cancelled by her actual reception of him, especially
at a moment when the unprecedented
constancy of the actress to the Democratic
leader was the theme of every tongue. There
was some piquancy, too, in this triumph over
a troublesome opponent, beneath whose rancorous
sarcasm he had writhed so often, and he
did not doubt that this consideration had influenced
Myrrah. He was not vain enough to
believe that any feeling personal to himself

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

had induced her to proffer him this interview,
and his sagacity could not conjecture any
more plausible motive for it than the wish to
mortify Invective Rabid. At the same time
Middleman Cautious&mdash;vaguely acquainted with
the secret machinations of the coalition against
his chief&mdash;thought it equally probable that
Myrrah, through her known connection with
Invective Rabid, should have possessed herself
of some of the secrets of the opposition, and
that the same impulse which prompted her to
appoint this rendezvous might induce her to
betray them.</p>

<p>These political considerations, added to the
fact of the unimportant nature of the debate
and the absence of the great guns of the opposition,
had in some measure determined him
to obey Myrrah's summons, though perhaps
there was more truth than he suspected in his
avowal to her that her promised communication
had been as much the pretext for, as the
motive of his visit.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

He came to lay at her feet the most flattering
tribute he could pay to her. <i>He</i>, Middleman
Cautious, who had piqued himself through
a long parliamentary career on the punctuality
of his attendance to all his public duties,
"came at her command," as he said, "neglecting
the business of the nation to devote an
hour to her."</p>

<p>But it was but a single hour, and that would
only have made half-past eleven o'clock!
Myrrah, therefore, while promising to make,
playfully deferred her promised revelations.
All her notorious powers of fascination&mdash;her
most irresistible blandishments, were summoned
to her aid to disguise the flight of
time; and time, charmed by these enchantments,
had flitted by with noiseless wing.</p>

<p>The reader has seen that it was midnight.</p>

<p>"Now that I have no wish to detain you,
you shall know all. But there are things that
one dare not speak&mdash;that one cannot convey
through words&mdash;would you understand an allegory

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

a <i>tableau vivant</i>. Look into yon glass.
Lay your head upon my lap, and now, as I
dissever one of these scanty locks, what does
that picture recall?" asked Myrrah, leaning over him with her golden scissors in
one hand, and a mesh of his iron-grey hair
between her fingers.</p>

<p>"I am dull," replied Middleman Cautious.
"I cannot understand&mdash;I do not take you."</p>

<p>"Stay, we will change the scene," said
Myrrah; "for, on my honour, I wish pantomimically
to convey to you an important
truth," and rapidly adjusting her dress, she
drew out from its gorgeous sheathe the sword
once presented to a great captain by a liberated
city. "Now lay down upon this ottoman and
look, with eyes nearly closed in mimicry of
sleep, at me, as having risen from your side, I
direct the murderous scimitar against your
neck. Of what historic incident does that remind
you?"</p>

<p>"The expression is artistic; the pose beyond
all praise; but still I do not take you."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

<p>"You are dull indeed! But perhaps," said
Myrrah, starting up, "you have never seen
the originals. Follow me." And leading her
guest into an adjacent chamber, she drew
the curtains of two pictures, in each of which
a female figure represented to the life the
form, features, and expression of Myrrah in
the attitudes in which she had just thrown
herself.</p>

<p>But in these works of art the prodigious
power of the Hebrew Hercules whose head
was on her lap, and the grim visage of the
warrior upon whose neck the fatal scimitar
was descending, even without explanatory accessories,
told at once the story of Samson
betrayed, and of the death of Holophernes.</p>

<p>"A foolish artist," said Myrrah, "the weakness
of whose heart or head could not resist an
experimental simile, once sought to avenge his
disappointment by painting me as the Delilah
and Judith. I, retaliating by contemptuous

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

indifference, bought the pictures. I allowed them to be exhibited and had them
placed here. Do you understand my allegory
now?"</p>

<p>"Not unless it be that you have lulled
Invective Rabid into security, and mean to
betray his unconstitutional secrets," replied
Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>"So the Hebrew champion and the Assyrian
leader thought, and so they perished!"
answered Myrrah. "Believing too readily in
woman's treachery towards her own, they succumbed
the victims of a woman's stratagem. And
you, Middleman Cautious, have fallen so into my
toils. The hour of amorous dalliance spent
with me was the last of your crumbling government.
At this moment it has ceased to exist.
Your chief and leader is a captive. His power
has passed to other hands, and you, his Achates
are not free to go beyond the precincts of this
dwelling."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

<p>"The woman raves!" ejaculated Middleman.</p>

<p>But Myrrah, as she spoke, threw open a
door beyond, in which a banquet glittered in
a flood of light, not the subdued light whose
voluptuous tint rather suffused than lighted
the apartment they had quitted. "These,"
continued Myrrah, "are the personages whom
this turn in the lottery of fortune, which sends
you downwards, has placed uppermost." But
the guests, if bidden guests they were, pressed
hurriedly through the hall, some only pausing
to snatch a hasty draught. Breathless and
discomposed, they were seeking Middleman
Cautious, on catching sight of whom, they
rushed to secure him, without noticing Myrrah's
presence, uttering a simultaneous exclamation
like that which bursts from a pack of hounds
when they light on the lost scent.</p>

<p>Then too she first perceived with pain that
Invective was not with them.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

<p>"Middleman Cautious!" said Sir Jasper, "it
is our painful duty to attach your person."</p>

<p>"In whose name?"</p>

<p>"In mine," replied Eustatius.</p>

<p>"John Cash is the Prime Minister of these
realms," replied Middleman calmly, "show
me his signature."</p>

<p>"John Cash has passed to another and, let
us hope, less turbulent world."</p>

<p>"What dead!" exclaimed his stricken servitor.</p>

<p>"He is no more," said Sir Jasper, "he died
in his son's arms."</p>

<p>"An apoplectic stroke," faltered Eustatius.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Middleman, turning a searching
glance upon the millionary's son, "an apoplectic
stroke, and you bled him, I suppose.
There is the print of bloody fingers on your
shirt."</p>

<p>Eustatius, who felt dizzy, faint, and sick,
closed his coat hurriedly, to hide these traces

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

which the conspirators thought they had obliterated.</p>

<p>"Eustatius," said Sir Jasper, "from this
I must to the senate. Compose yourself. In
half an hour I will present you to the senators,
as your father's heir. I go to secure
your appointment to his office, and I leave
Middleman Cautious in your safe custody
meanwhile."</p>

<p>"There is little need," said Middleman
when Sir Jasper was gone. "If your lamented
sire be dead indeed, in whatever manner he
may have died, I must regard his death&mdash;the
dissolution of his government&mdash;as a fact accomplished.
He has left a will but it is not signed.
You are his inheritor, as such command my
services. Your inheritance is so complicated
and so vast that you will require them even
to discover its extent."</p>

<p>Meanwhile where was Invective Rabid, for
whom Myrrah inquired in vain? Invective
Rabid had hastened to the senate, and thence

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

had just reached Myrrah's door. In the excitement
of precautionary measures to be
taken&mdash;in the flush of rapid action, and in
the comforting reflection that his great rival
was no more, he had begun to recover from the
horror with which the deed he had abetted
had inspired him. He had almost succeeded
in persuading himself that his part in that
dark transaction had been one of mere justifiable
hostility and defensive violence. His
solicitude was now to discover the person
of Tempest, of which he was determined
without loss of time to secure the custody.
He was then seeking Middleman Cautious to
endeavour to extract from him if possible the
place of the youth's confinement, when a hand
was placed detentively upon his arm. He
turned, and Tempest stood beside him.</p>

<p>At this apparition a superstitious fear
overcame Invective, and for a moment he
was obliged to support himself against the
wall.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

<p>"It is time we met," said Tempest. "I
have been watching since sunset to waylay
you."</p>

<p>"Who, in the name of H&mdash;&mdash;, has loosed
you on me?"</p>

<p>"No one," replied Tempest. "I have delivered
myself."</p>

<p>"What!" said Invective apostrophising the
deceased, "the old dotard! were there no bolts,
no bars strong enough&mdash;was there no dungeon
so secure&mdash;no mine so deep&mdash;no grave so silent,
as would have made you safe?"</p>

<p>"Bolts and bars cannot imprison&mdash;the grave
cannot extinguish&mdash;thought; death only gives
it immortality," replied Tempest.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid, after the first surprise
which had shaken his disordered nerves was
over, began to reflect that this unaccountable
meeting had taken place opportunely, since
just as he was invested with a share of temporary
power; but then the thought struck
him that take whatever precaution he would,

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

yet Tempest might speak, and even though
treated as a madman, <i>yet</i> the unlucky application
of one sentence he might utter
would lead to the detection of Invective's
plagiarism.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid was still armed. If once
rid of Tempest his anxieties would be ended&mdash;fate
seemed to have thrown his two deadliest
enemies successively into his power. One
had ceased to exist, why not the other? Blood
had been shed already, why not more?</p>

<p>But Tempest saw the motion of his arm,
divined, and changed his purpose.</p>

<p>"My death would be your ruin, my detention
your disgrace. Sad experience has taught
me with whom I deal; and therefore I have
provided that whenever I am missing for
four-and-twenty hours your shame will be
published to the world. This understood between
us, I have come to make you the guardian
of my life and liberty."</p>

<p>Invective Rabid thus baffled and confounded,

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

felt his brain&mdash;overwrought with this
rapid succession of events&mdash;grow dizzy, and
dropped the weapon he was holding, on the
pavement, from his unnerved grasp.</p>

<p>"Pick up your arms and follow me!" said
Tempest with the accent of a master to a
slave, and with a rapid stride he led Invective,
who mechanically followed, into the centre of
the square.</p>

<p>"Now listen!" said Tempest. "Henceforward
you must do my bidding. The guilt
and baseness of mankind first entailed on
man obedience to his fellow man. Your own
now retributively binds you to obey me. I
could smite; but I will spare. The fame
you have usurped is a pillar of strength in the
people's cause&mdash;that cause I will not weaken by
exposing you. Only mark me! henceforward
I shall appropriate your acquisitions, I shall
exact your unwearying exertions. You are
become my servitor as surely as I am the
people's servant, and if you swerve one hair's

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

breadth in your fidelity to either&mdash;beware! I
will inexorably defame your reputation, blast
your power, and fling your name a prey to
the world's scorn and execration! Think over
this. I leave you! We shall meet sooner and
more often than you may wish for." With
these words Tempest moved away and was lost
to sight, whilst Invective still remained rooted
to the spot.</p>

of this fact, recognised&mdash;by the nomination
of Eustatius to the post his father had
occupied&mdash;the hereditary character with which
the late minister had invested his once ephemeral
office.</p>

<p>It had in truth long been obvious that according
to the present constitution of the
United Monarchies, the immense patronage

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

and influence attached to the unprecedented
possessions accumulated by John Cash must
give their owner that parliamentary preponderance
which entitles to the guidance of the
State. Under these circumstances in which the
hereditary premiership had become a transmissible
sovereignty, and the adviser of the
premier a real minister, the confidence of Eustatius
in Sir Jasper was hailed as of happy
omen, and though all felt that the monarchy
which John Cash had founded was perpetuated,
yet it was augured that its growing
absolution would not be continued.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty of the confederates,
after the death of John Cash, was to make
the public believe in it. The world had grown
to regard him as too tough a customer for
even the grim king of terrors to meddle with.
After its experience of his former resuscitation
from his rumoured grave, it looked confidently
forward to seeing him turn up again.
The belief was so prevalent that he would

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

still be seen, when least expected, emerging
with umbrella under arm from the private
entrance through which the conspirators had
found admission to his chamber, that nothing
less than the exposition of his body in state
would have secured the popular conviction of
his decease. This step the marks of violence
upon the corpse forbade. They had no Sir
James Wylie to plaster up its hideous indentations
and to paint over the disfigured and
blackened countenance, as he did by the remains
of the murdered Paul.</p>

<p>In this dilemma even Sir Jasper advised
acceptance of the proffered services of Middleman
Cautious, whose submission to the new
order of things was calculated to bear with it
immediate weight.</p>

<p>It will thus be understood how, shortly
after the old man's death, his chief servant
should have been amicably transacting business
with the son he had been employed to

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

thwart so often. He was delivering to Eustatius
a general statement of the extent and
nature of his inheritance. Sir Jasper and
Eustatius had been persuaded that John Cash
had been possessed of enormous wealth; but
all their anticipations were at fault.</p>

<p>Not even the wildest speculations, built
up on the most exaggerated rumour, had even
faintly foreshadowed the truth.</p>

<p>But for the sober seriousness and financial
knowledge of Middleman, both would have
leaped to the conclusion that he was indulging
in an improbable romance of figures.</p>

<p>Eustatius, bewildered with the recapitulation
of millions and of the inexhaustible variety of
their investment, had ceased from following
the expositor to pause and wonder, and Sir
Jasper listened with unspeakable astonishment
chequered with occasional incredulity
which Middleman promptly dispelled by the
practical precision of his replies.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

<p>"No wonder!" exclaimed Sir Jasper at
length, "that nothing could resist the influence
of the old man. You develop an astounding
system&mdash;association within association&mdash;wheel
within wheel&mdash;in which the public
private fortune is entangled, and John Cash
for ever discovered as the primary and moving
cause in every combination! I congratulate
you, Eustatius! You have little left to
desire."</p>

<p>"And little to require," added Middleman
Cautious, "you will perceive that the wealth
of which you have become possessed has been
disposed of according to a system which must
eventually absorb all other property whatever,
by the unerring principles which regulate
financial matters with as much certainty as
fluids obey the law of hydrostatics. It needs
in fact now only be left to its undisturbed
operation to achieve what little is left to do in
the shape of acquisition."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

<p>"Eustatius!" said Sir Jasper, "in quest of
a treasure we have found an inexhaustible mine.
The fabled wealth of Eastern hyperbole fades
into insignificance before it. Why, if I read
aright, Great Britain alone is indirectly
mortgaged for one thousand five hundred
millions!"</p>

<p>"That is to say," added Middleman Cautious,
"for nearly double the amount of the
national debt which Sir Robert Peel repudiated
half a century ago, when he turned
Chartist. A sum which in bullion, to put it
picturesquely, would considerably exceed a
thousand cubic yards of gold, or a solid mass
thirty feet broad, wide, and high, of the precious
metal!"</p>

<p>"There is only one thing inexplicable to
me," said Sir Jasper, "and that is how, with
such irresistible means of influence in so
many unsuspected quarters, its late possessor
should have tolerated the opposition he did;

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

we can only attribute it to the unhappy alienation
which threatened us with a danger, of
which we can only now perceive the true extent,
that it is fortunately averted."</p>

<p>"There is one thing more. I should be neglecting
my duty as a depository of the confidence
of my late lamented chief," said Middleman
Cautious, "if I failed to impress upon
you the great maxims which he would have
bequeathed with his fortune if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare us allusions to a family misfortune,"
said Eustatius gloomily.</p>

<p>"They are ill-timed, indelicate, unnecessary,"
added Sir Jasper with contracted
brows.</p>

<p>"I had no intention," replied Middleman
Cautious, "further than the business in hand
rendered imperative, of referring to the past.
I have accepted it as a fact accomplished and
irretrievable. I was about to remark that
the late John Cash has inserted in his will

<!-- vol 3 page 244 -->

the solemn admonition to his inheritor. <i>Not
to strain the bow as far as it would bend. To
enjoy prosperity with lenity and moderation,
disguising, not parading it, and never to forget
that the power he had bequeathed was founded on
respect for the rights of property; which respect
would cease whenever the world should be made
to feel or allowed to know that all property was
monopolised by one individual.</i> And yet, gentlemen,
the painful event which has this day
brought us together, proves that John Cash
was a man who underrated, instead of exaggerating,
the difficulties and perils of his
position."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Sir Jasper, "the
greatest tact, industry, and prudence are indispensable
in guiding such overwhelming fortunes,
not alone profitably, but even in common
safety."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," replied Eustatius in a tone
which aroused the suspicion of both his auditors
that they would find him far more difficult

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

to lead than they had reckoned on, "permit
me to observe, that there is one very plain
maxim by which I propose to regulate my
conduct; it is simply that <span class="smcap">every man has
a right to do what he likes with his
own</span>."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">A PARTY LEADER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Confederates having effected the purpose
they had leagued together to accomplish, dissolved
their ill-assorted union, relapsing into
former hostility. They had in point of fact
never ceased to be rivals whose enmity had
only been suspended, not absorbed in their
combination against a mutually dangerous opponent.</p>

<p>It was the prevalent impression that with
the life of the late minister his despotism had
ceased. The public was as yet unaware that

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

he had never brought forward one tithe of
the means of coercion he possessed, and it was
ignorant both of the fact that they had passed
into the hands of his son, and of that son's
designs and character.</p>

<p>Having removed in concert the great obstacle
to their respective ambitions, these were allowed
to follow their natural bent without
restriction.</p>

<p>Eustatius&mdash;supposed to represent opinions
conservative or stationary, but whose real
tendency was retrogressive&mdash;carried on the
government with the support of Sir Jasper
and of Middleman Cautious.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid again in opposition stood
forth as the champion of ideas fortuitously
progressive, though the fruit of mere subversive
inspirations.</p>

<p>Both parties had reasons for burying in oblivion
an event in which they were equally implicated,
and by which both had profited.</p>

<p>Eustatius and Sir Jasper had passed from

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

opposition to office&mdash;from factious notoriety
to the possession of authority prospectively
unlimited by the removal of old Cash from
the scene; and this incident which renewed
the hopes of the oligarchists, served at the
same time to raise the importance of Invective
Rabid's position. He was no longer the
mere chief of a clamorous but powerless party,
deriving its sole weight from the vague prospect
of being able to outlive the gradual repression
of a ruler to whose encroachments,
whilst he lived, no one dreamed that effective
resistance could be offered.</p>

<p>That contingency was realised. He was now
the recognised leader of a formidable opposition
which might reasonably expect to secure
majorities, and was considered capable of eventually
establishing its preponderance in the
state. Men of weight, character, and proverbial
prudence, who had formerly kept aloof
now heartily joined his party. Substantial influence
strengthened his former popularity.

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

From the desultory partisan he had become at
one step the chief of an embattled host.</p>

<p>It was midday. He was in the midst of
those occupations which obtrude on the most
indolent of party leaders. A few of his most
valuable adherents, and confidential friends
were around him. He was receiving their congratulations,
and busied in discussing an approaching
election.</p>

<p>So great a change had taken place in public
affairs that the interference of his party was
now sufficient to secure the return of a popular
candidate for any representation which fell
vacant, and that his personal recommendation
served to determine without appeal the individual
to be supported by that party.</p>

<p>Nomination to the seat in question was
therefore as much at his discretion as a rotten
borough had been formerly at the disposal of
its patron, or a subordinate place in the gift of
a minister. He had been accordingly beset by
solicitations and applicants.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

<p>To escape their importunities he had made
an early selection, and was referring to
that fact in answer to the earnest intercession
of one of his most influential followers in
favour of another candidate.</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate," said Invective. "I am
free to confess that, under the circumstances, I
might have been induced to give my interest
to D&mdash;&mdash;, but it is too late. My word is
passed. I have made a promise. There is
nothing to be done." A conclusion in which
his petitioner could but concur.</p>

<p>It was however remarked that the temper
of the Democratic leader had in this respect
contradictorily altered with his fortunes; that
according as these were ascendant his spirits
had become depressed. How was it that this
man so dauntless when playing an up hill and
almost desperate game, should appear to lose
courage now that a fair field and favourable
opportunities were before him?</p>

<p>Aware that his discouragement could but

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

suggest such thoughts he made an effort. He
was himself again. He resumed the boastful
confidence which had so often cheered his
followers in adversity, and now sounded in
their ears an augury of triumph. But in the
very midst of this burst, a voice, to which he
was painfully sensitive, caught his ear amidst
the sounds of altercation in the anteroom.</p>

<p>A stranger, whom his well-tutored attendants
dared not violently eject from the house
of their popular master, sought resolutely and
was stoutly denied admission.</p>

<p>At that voice Invective faltered and turned
pale, and then hastened to the door with a few
words of apology to his guests.</p>

<p>Need the reader be told that it was
Tempest?</p>

<p>The cold self-possession of his mien, and his
passionless brevity of speech, struck Invective
with a feeling of awe against which he vainly
struggled, because it strengthened a conviction,
which unnerved him, of the real, and not

<!-- vol 3 page 252 -->

as he strove to believe, of the adventitious superiority
of Tempest.</p>

<p>"You must not close your doors in future
against the people's friend, as long as you are
the people's servant," said Tempest.</p>

<p>"If I had known," replied Invective "that
you came as a&mdash;&mdash;friend."</p>

<p>"No, not as a friend," said Tempest,
"friendship&mdash;at best the partial exercise of
an invidious philanthropy&mdash;would be difficult
between us, but I came as a colleague&mdash;not as
an enemy."</p>

<p>"You are welcome," answered Invective.
"We live in a strange world and in strange
times; but since we are to act henceforward
in concert, I rejoice at this opportunity, I rejoice
that you have come to determine the
basis of our future intercourse."</p>

<p>"Invective Rabid," said Tempest gravely.
"The conditions of that intercourse have been
already determined. They are simply that I
shall command, and you obey. I come to

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

exact a proof of your submission; it is an
instalment of the debt of expiation you owe
to the state and to me."</p>

<p>"Command whatever I can do in reparation
of the past. What would you have
of me?"</p>

<p>"That you should usher me into public
life," replied Tempest.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said Invective, "but if to
escape one humiliation I am to expose myself
to another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand you; but fear not. So long
as you obey, so long as you do not swerve
directly or indirectly, it will be to my interest
to uphold the character of a champion of the
people's cause. Alone together&mdash;I am the
master&mdash;you the servitor. In public I treat
you with a deference, politic if undeserved."</p>

<p>"And how&mdash;in what character would you
have me introduce you to the public notice?"</p>

<p>"As a representative of the people."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

<p>"Whenever a general election takes place,"
said Invective, "in a year or so, you may
count upon my influence."</p>

<p>"No," answered Tempest, "not in a year
or two&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"But," said Invective, "it is out of my
power; there is no constituency unrepresented."</p>

<p>"There is one seat vacant now."</p>

<p>"One was vacant," said Invective, "it is
still, constitutionally speaking, disposable; but
I have promised it&mdash;my word is past."</p>

<p>"You must revoke your promise&mdash;you must
break through your word."</p>

<p>"My plighted word?"</p>

<p>"If you had never done so beneath the eye
of heaven, you need not now before the face
of man. I cannot brook delay. The time
lost in my cell must be retrieved even though
to your inconvenience. Now&mdash;at once&mdash;from
this spot you must proceed to act with me as
your candidate. Such is my decision. I will

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

it should be so." And Tempest spoke in an
accent of command and with an expression of
resolution before which Invective's dejected
spirit quailed in silence.</p>

<p>A few minutes after, Invective Rabid appeared
leading Tempest into the circle he had
quitted. His partisans appeared surprised at
the introduction of a stranger at so confidential
a meeting; but what was not their surprise
when the democratic leader announced the
unknown as his nominee for the vacant
borough?</p>

<p>There followed expostulation from the friends
of the rejected, indignant remonstrance from
those of the favoured candidate. Invective Rabid,
profoundly humiliated and chagrined, took
refuge in haughty taciturnity, vouchsafing no
explanation beyond the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I made that promise, gentlemen,
it was under the supposition that my friend
could not have availed himself of the opportunity.
His services being now disposable, I

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

should neglect a duty to my country if I fail
to secure them in its cause. This stranger,
though unknown to you, will not long remain
so either to yourselves or to the world. You
will soon hail in him a new champion, and if
you will address to him the murmurs with
which you are assailing me, he may perchance
convince you now of the superiority which
justifies the preference. I have given him
over you."</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the mixed dissatisfaction
and wonder occasioned by this abrupt apparition
of Tempest on the political scene, in
which though lost in conjecture as to its nature,
it did not escape the penetration of
Invective's intimates, that the democratic
leader took some painful interest.</p>

<p>That night as Invective mused in restless
gloom, which Myrrah found only irritated by
her efforts to soothe, he suddenly started from
his reverie, and answering the questions
she had asked some hours before, exclaimed,

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

"What would you of the wild steed which
champs the bit for the first time?&mdash;what of the
snared lion? Can you not conceive the narrow
restraint after the boundless freedom? Can
you understand what it is for him who has
owned no law, to breathe by another's breath,
to move by another's motion? to know that
even death, the refuge of the slave, affords no
sanctuary, because having learned to live in
the thoughts of others, the grave still leaves
vulnerable a memory which may be defamed!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Myrrah, "why
not confide in me, the devoted handmaiden of
your glory?"</p>

<p>"What did I mean?" replied Invective,
"nothing, Myrrah&mdash;what did I say? mere idle
words&mdash;let us forget them in love, wine, and
music."</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">TEMPEST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A space</span> brief in itself, but pregnant with
change has elapsed. A few months have passed
by, and the condition both of society at large
and of the chief personages who have been
introduced to the reader during the progress
of this story is singularly altered, though that
modification is but the development of effects
whose causes were in active operation when
this narrative was interrupted.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

<p>Eustatius has not only succeeded to the
full measure of his father's power, but he ostentatiously
exercises that which his father so
carefully concealed. Sir Jasper has met with
bitter disappointment. His political pupil, escaping
from the tutelage which he flattered
himself to have inextricably imposed upon
him, has called Middleman Cautious to
share his councils; and though either separately
might have rendered their patron a mere
tool, the competition of their rivalry has
degraded them into mere instruments of the
man whose capacity they alike despise. Nothing
is easier than to rouse the suspicion of a fool!
and Eustatius has been led so far to mistrust
both his advisers that the influence of each,
is chiefly limited to thwarting the views of
the other. Hence the son of old Cash pursues,
without remonstrance, a course which the
experience of either would have led them to
condemn as reckless; whilst Sir Jasper has
been outbidding Middleman Cautious, and

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

whilst Middleman Cautious has been outbidding
Sir Jasper in acquiescence with the
views of Eustatius, Eustatius has progressed
to a stolid self-confidence which it is now utterly
beyond their power to bridle.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, besides fighting
under his true colours, the son of old Cash has
to contend with a very different adversary from
any who opposed his father.</p>

<p>Three months have sufficed to raise Tempest
from obscurity to fame. Three months have
sufficed to bruit his name as widely as the
reputation of his deceased persecutor; and
Tempest is the formidable champion who supported
by the hopes and fears, and gratitude
of the multitude, now assails his son's
supremacy.</p>

<p>Tempest had burst upon the world like a
meteor&mdash;dazzling and sudden&mdash;which leaves
no track in the dark ether through which it
has passed, whereby its origin, may be retraced,
and which gives no indication of its destination
through its gloom. Everything concerning

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

him was, to the world, alike novel,
unfathomable, and unprecedented.</p>

<p>His career had been one succession of marvels,
his genius a wonder, his life was still a
mystery.</p>

<p>When the astonishment excited by his abrupt
introduction into the political arena had
subsided, his exposition of the causes of the
murrain attracted universal notice. It was at
a season when the insect pest was decimating
millions through the agency of the famine it
occasioned. Men listened eagerly, rather on
account of the fearful interest of the subject,
and because of the novelty of the idea,
than with the most remote belief.</p>

<p>It was judged the wild hallucination of a
mind over-wrought&mdash;the crotchet of a genius.
Conviction followed, forced upon incredulity
by irresistible proof.</p>

<p>The existence of ravages of the insect were
popularly no less demonstrable than the discovery
of air, gas, electricity, and such fluids and

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

agencies as had escaped detection during
ages.</p>

<p>Tempest rendered them tangible to the
million, and the million wondering that they
had so long escaped its notice, was filled with
dread and horror.</p>

<p>But when the share of old Cash in this
calamity was denounced by Tempest, the supporters
of government, though no longer able
to contest the organic nature of the plague,
retiring behind their next entrenchment,
stoutly denied all participation in the extension
of the murrain by the ruling family. Not
that they expressed in private circles, this incredulity
which the agitation of the masses
prompted them to avow in public. "Eustatius
Cash," they said, "had only inherited his father's
property, not his guilt," and when it was argued
that the wealth in question was the fruit of
the old man's transgression, they answered
with alarm "that the whole proceeding had been
lawful, if not philanthropic&mdash;that interference

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

with his acquisitions would infringe the sacred
rights of property, that on the security of property
all credit was based," whilst it must be remembered
that they were utterly dependent
upon the public credit.</p>

<p>At this stage the career of Tempest might
have been arrested by a stretch of authority
which was in contemplation; but then took
place his greatest triumph.</p>

<p>The long vigils which still blanched his
cheek, and the solitude in which he lived
amidst a public life, brought forth their fruit.
He had discovered the object of his almost
hopeless search. He had found, if not a means
of extirpating his predecessor's creation, a fresh
antidote to arrest the course of its ravages,
unrestrainable as they had been deemed.</p>

<p>Tempest published his discovery to the
world. Its gratitude and applause rendered
him for a time unassailable even by
the overgrown power of Eustatius. His
praises burst from millions of lips, qualified
only by the regrets of his friends.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

<p>Who could not but lament that when they
had reckoned on a bent purely political,
in their favourite, he should have taken a scientific
turn.</p>

<p>"His discovery," they said, "is useful,
very useful, and no doubt conducive to his
present popularity, but it will prove eventually
injurious to his credit as a politician. It is a
change of line. He will rank certainly next
to Doctor Jenner, as a public benefactor and
all that sort of thing. He may acquire an
immortality in pocket books, and find the date
of his birth, death, or of his discovery recorded
in the margin of the lined pages which
chronicle such events as the roasting of an
ox upon the Thames, the attempt made by
Margaret Nicholson on the life of George the
Third, the birth of a son to the Duke of Cambridge,
or a dreadful hurricane in the Barbadoes&mdash;but,
poor fellow! he might have been
a statesman!"</p>

<p>As for Eustatius, he was outraged beyond

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

expression at the discovery of Tempest, and it
required the combined influence of Middleman
Cautious and of Sir Jasper to restrain him from
attempting to resent, in some arbitrary manner,&mdash;what
he considered an infraction of his
rights.</p>

<p>"We shall come to that," expostulated Sir
Jasper, blandly, "but just now&mdash;in the present
state of feeling&mdash;believe me, it would still be
premature."</p>

<p>"What, and must I submit to have filched
from me a privilege on which all the wealth of
my house has been founded? Is not that
murrain and its remedy a family property?
and if others are allowed to interfere in it
what becomes of all patent laws? what
becomes of the distinctions of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>,
what becomes of the sacred rights of ownership?"</p>

<p>"Very true," replied Middleman Cautious,
"only, though the murrain was once your
chief instrument of acquisition, it is worthy of

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

remark, that its productive value has ceased.
Your possessions are so vast that by the natural
process of accumulation in a very brief space
they will have absorbed the remainder. The
murrain could have done no more, whilst the
prospect of its future ravages might at least
have damaged its reversionary value."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Eustatius, "no
one can say that your zeal outruns your discretion.
But when I am lord of the last remaining
acre, do you know what I will prove
to the world? I will tell you. That I know
at least how to do what I like with
my own."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">TEMPEST AND MYRRAH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wrapped</span> in study&mdash;overwhelmed with occupation&mdash;and
unaccustomed to social intercourse,
the time of Tempest was divided between the
senate, the council, and the seclusion of his
cabinet.</p>

<p>The austere simplicity, and the inviolable
solitude of his private life, did not ill-accord
either with his impenetrable antecedents, or
with the sudden appearance on the political

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

stage of a celebrity, who, though now bound
to every shade of the opposition by all the public
ties which connect a successful leader with his
party, had never contracted the faintest intimacy
with his partisans.</p>

<p>The mystery which attached to his origin,
history, and former pursuits, the gravity of his
demeanour and his retiring habits, served to
invest his character with a halo of interest.
Though innocent of having studied to produce
this effect, he was not insensible to its advantages.</p>

<p>His extreme youth was forgotten in the
singularity which estranged him from the
familiar sympathies of life, and the superiority
which the mediocrity of riper years, so rarely
pardons in the young, gave little umbrage in one
who was never seen in his hours of relaxation
to abdicate the dignity of his public character.</p>

<p>Without attitudinizing, he seemed to subside
from energetic brilliancy into antique simplicity,

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

and the reserve of his privacy, was
in strict keeping with the heroic display which
he made before the world of his genius and
of his daring.</p>

<p>But in truth, it was no premature indifference
engendered in perceptive obtuseness, or
in philosophic scorn; it was no satiety of the
world's untasted pleasures, which rendered
Tempest insensible to their enjoyment&mdash;from
which pride, want of leisure and social ignorance,
debarred him. Pride which delights in
loneliness; the want of leisure occasioned by
the Herculean labours which his restless energy
had prompted him to undertake; and social ignorance&mdash;the
ignorance of little things, neglected
in the acquisition of mightier knowledge.</p>

<p>He had passed through childhood mated to
senility; youth brought with it for him, no more
companionship than Pitt or Cond&eacute; could have
found in the generation of boys they had outstripped,
or of envious men whom they had
overtaken.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

<p>Therefore he stood alone, aloof and awe-inspiring&mdash;no
less an enigma to the few, than
a marvel to the many.</p>

<p>Thus become an object of public interest
and wonder, the youthful leader of his party
could not fail to excite the curiosity of one,
whose sympathies were enlisted in favour of the
man whom his sudden reputation had cast into
shade. Myrrah had long since recognised in
Tempest, the mysterious rival, whose first appearance
had stamped the brow of Invective
Rabid with the premonition of evil.</p>

<p>A feeling first of hostility towards him who
came to thwart the ambition she now shared,
arose in her bosom, and then followed a strange
longing to see and essay her woman's wit
against the intruder's genius. But dames, if
less celebrated and fair than Myrrah, still&mdash;as
the exalted and the highly born&mdash;immeasurably
her superiors, had crowded to listen to his
eloquence, had rushed to waylay his steps, and
yet had sought in vain, not only intimacy but

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

even acquaintance with him. But this difficulty
served only still farther to pique the curiosity
of Myrrah. Her longing settled into a fixed
determination. The intimates who now thronged
her board, to indulge the whim of Invective
Rabid, whose darkening mood craved the
relief of social intercourse, had long made this
resolution the theme of pleasantry.</p>

<p>Some of these guests were around her&mdash;it
was evening. The open window overlooked
the park and river.</p>

<p>"Myrrah!" said one of her visitors, pointing
to the figure of a man emerging from the
trees. "As I live there is Tempest. So this is
the place of his retirement&mdash;this is why you
have chosen such a retreat?"</p>

<p>"You are right," said Myrrah. "It is he.
I have not been misinformed. During a month
past I have been told that after sunset he
wanders for an hour along that bank."</p>

<p>"He has been ailing lately," observed one
of the guests.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

<p>"And is there nothing else brings him
here?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Nothing but the quest of relaxation in
solitude after the cares of the busy day," replied
the first.</p>

<p>"That is to say," observed Invective Rabid,
"the wish to avoid you and your fellows."</p>

<p>"He must have need of some repose," said
the first speaker.</p>

<p>"He has need of much talent," replied
Lord Besom, "to induce one to forgive his
presumptuous pretension&mdash;the disdain of all
companionship&mdash;the airs of the veiled prophet
which he assumes."</p>

<p>"If one dared obtrude upon him," said a
visitor, "but he might think that he was
watched and resent it&mdash;some clue might be
discovered to his mysterious habits. Is it
quite sure that there is no fair spirit whom he
invokes in the solitude of this retreat?"</p>

<p>"None!" replied Myrrah. "When here he
is alone."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

<p>"And that," said Lord Besom, "is what I
least forgive him. His contempt for men
might pass. Most men are contemptible
enough, but the affectation of disdaining your
sex, Myrrah, is an infirmity which stirs my
chivalric bile. I do not wonder that it touches
you to think that there is one breast steeled
against all feminine attractions, that there
breathes one insensible to your charms, and that
this youth turns away from woman like a
moslemin from a thing unclean."</p>

<p>"Who has told you that he is insensible to
my influence?" replied Myrrah. "When has
it been tried? If he avoids he fears, and we
will test now whether I may not prevail."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Invective, "that is a triumph
beyond your art."</p>

<p>"I will make the trial," said Myrrah.
"This is the opportunity I have so much
longed for. Though birth the proudest, and
beauty the most renowned, are denied access

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

to him, I have discovered that where he
thinks himself unknown he is affable to the
people. It is my intention to place myself
upon his path as he returns from his evening's
ramble. If he should not recognise me?"</p>

<p>"If he should fail to recognise, Myrrah,"
said Lord Besom, "he will be more singular
in that than in everything besides."</p>

<p>As Myrrah was speaking she had retired
but only to return after a few minutes' absence.
How brief the time, yet how complete the
transformation!</p>

<p>The very guests she had quitted scarcely recognised
her. The actress stood before them
now, the impersonation of rustic simplicity and
youth.</p>

<p>The trace of passion&mdash;the deep lines of irony
had vanished from her lip and brow. Years,
with their recollections and their guile, seemed
banished from that sweet countenance by an

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

effort of volition. Such was the innocence
and candour of her aspect&mdash;so perfect an ideal
of the country maiden did she present&mdash;that
she was hailed by an involuntary burst of
simultaneous applause, which redoubled when
curtsying modestly to the company, she addressed
them with an enchanting na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and
in language just picturesquely tinted with
provincialism. There was nothing in fact but
the coquetry of her small buckled shoes, and
the delicacy of the taper fingers protruding
through her mittens by which the most practised
eye could have detected the fraud.</p>

<p>"What do you say, gentlemen? How will
you wager? Will he avoid me?"</p>

<p>"If he has any regard for his own peace."
replied Lord Besom gallantly, "most assuredly
he will fly."</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>Threading that path which meanders through

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

the trees, Tempest, where an abrupt turn displays
the river, comes suddenly upon a female
figure.</p>

<p>Without other witness than the skies above&mdash;the
grove around&mdash;the stream before her, to
which she makes a mute appeal, a whole story
is in her attitude and expression.</p>

<p>Her gipsy bonnet is flung upon the grass,
the long tresses escaping from restraint, float
over her fair shoulders, her hands are clasped,
her eyes upturned; and thus bending over the
wave in which about to plunge, she looks the
living image of despair.</p>

<p>At one bound Tempest is by her side. With
a faint scream she springs forward, his grasp
restrains her, she is in his arms&mdash;insensible.</p>

<p>As he deposits on a mossy bank the inanimate
form&mdash;as he attempting to revive her
chafes the transparent temples and scatters
over her brow and bosom the water
gathered in his palm&mdash;the contemplation of

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

that surpassing loveliness is forced upon
him.</p>

<p>It troubles him. He would willingly pass
onward, or avert his glance, or turn aside, but
as it may not be, that beauty&mdash;to which his soul
is so susceptible&mdash;moves him as he gazes. Pity
and admiration mingle in the thought that but
for his interference so fair a creature might lie
in the cold slime of that river's bed, those
delicate proportions bloating into distortion and
that dainty frame advancing towards its first
livid stage in the loathsome progress of decay.</p>

<p>But to have withheld her from those waters
is not to have rescued her from such a fate. He
cannot leave her lifeless there, and when her
lips murmur, and her eyes opening glance
wildly round, and then swim in tears, he
cannot leave her&mdash;then. He must still save her
from herself.</p>

<p>When he seeks to extract the motive of
her rash attempt&mdash;when he questions her
about her home, she answers mournfully "that

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

it is far away." When he asks whither she
is going, a bitter smile plays on her lips, and
her eye wanders, with involuntary significance,
towards the dark surface of the eddying river.</p>

<p>Tempest presses her no further, he seeks only
to dissuade her in tones of sympathy and with
words of kindness from suicidal despair. There is
a persuasive softness in his language which
melts the reckless resolution her wild looks convey.
He has succeeded in awakening a human
interest amidst that desolation. A shower of
tears succeeds to the flash of passion, and then&mdash;her
eyes glance up into his with an expression
of wonder, gratitude, and affection, which,
as consciousness returns, merges into modest
confusion. Yet in that fair heaving bosom the
heart of the actress bounds with exultation.
Oh! for an amphitheatre dense with human
heads witnessing her triumph, for never has
she earned so well the tributary tempest of
scattered flowers&mdash;the plaudits of ten thousand
rattling palms!</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

<p>Myrrah feels that she has triumphed. That
the deep, soft, dangerous gaze, never yet turned
ineffectually into human eyes, had not been
prolonged in vain. That the fascination of its
magic splendour has sunk into the recesses of
his soul, illumining it with an unconscious ray
of love, with a nascent aspiration of desire.</p>

<p>What signifies the tale that Myrrah pours
into Tempest's ear, extracted from her gratitude
and grief,&mdash;amidst sighs and tears,&mdash;in
broken sentences and abrupt admissions, alternated
with wild bursts of pathos?</p>

<p>Suffice to say, that he whose keen glance
pierces through the fraud of men grown grey
in the art of deceiving, he whose acute perception
peers through the mist of ignorance
with which the world is enveloped,
he believes as implicitly as the child whose
credulity no falsehood has ever scared. He
believes her to be forlorn, persecuted, and unhappy,
but&mdash;still to be reconciled with life.</p>

<p>No living soul knows him in this retreat.

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

To the world, as to her, he is a solitary student.
He offers her an asylum. He must depart in
a few hours, to pursue his avocations in the busy
haunts of men, but to return the following day
at sunset. Yielding to his entreaties, she
swears that she will do nothing rash till his
return, and leaning on his arm allows him to
lead her towards his secluded dwelling.</p>

<p>But as they pursue their way, every figure
advancing along their path in the declining
sunset occasions her alarm and makes her seek
nervously to turn aside. Why, therefore,
when they come to that lonely footway should
she take to the right across the open space
fronting the crowded balcony of that villa
which her companion seeks to shun?</p>

<p>In that balcony sit the guests she has
quitted.</p>

<p>"By heavens! there is Myrrah! That is
Tempest! As I live, she leans upon his arm!
Oh! for the wit of woman, and the frailty of
man's wisdom!"</p>

<p>"Shall we go down to meet them?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

<p>"No! on your lives make not a sign!" replied
Invective Rabid. "I told you, gentlemen,
that this incomparable Tempest, a giant
in some kinds of knowledge, was a child&mdash;a
fool in others. He never saw Myrrah in his
life. It is an admirable jest, but let us keep
it to ourselves&mdash;let us be prudent, and some
good may yet possibly arise from this for all of us."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">THE BIOGRAPHER AND HISTORIAN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is perhaps far advanced into our tale to introduce
the reader again into the presence of
so discursive a personage as Grubout Florid,
the historian and biographer. Nevertheless we
are in his study.&mdash;Sitting with a companion
whose pursuits resemble his own, he discourseth
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not of your opinion. I still conceive
human history to be an onward pilgrimage in
the course of which the wanderer man sometimes
deviate from the road, but only to retrace

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

his steps and right his course by the
immutable star of truth towards which he
cannot shape his way without progressing.</p>

<p>"Many stages he has never yet proceeded
without turning into some diverging path, but
though lost for a space, the prosecution of the
wrong at length ensures its detection and he
avoids the error, like the traveller, who with
the fall of day recognises his true direction by
the setting sun or rising moon, and quits the
false guidance of the deceptive land marks
which have led his steps astray.</p>

<p>"It may be only to lose himself upon the morrow&mdash;to
wander again and again out of his path,
but yet grown more wary as he proceeds, to
err less often, and reach eventually the goal to
which he aspires.</p>

<p>"A direct advance towards the right&mdash;a
side-long divergence towards the wrong&mdash;marks
each succeeding phase of human history, impeding
not arresting progress.</p>

<p>"The antique love of equality and freedom

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

never quenched, has been transmitted down to
our generation, yet of old&mdash;contracting into an
exclusive sphere&mdash;its results beyond were the
Helot's doom, and the oppression which made a
Spartacus.</p>

<p>"The gospel's law of unresisting love is the
point from which fanaticism diverged to depopulate
a world&mdash;to light the Inquisition's fires
to inspire a Mary or Elizabeth, and to prompt
the cruel intolerance of a Laud.</p>

<p>"Christianity's simple precepts were the
texts from which subtle theologians filled their
prolix tomes&mdash;seeking to paint the lily and
to render more plain the plainest of all truths.</p>

<p>"And yet that law&mdash;those precepts&mdash;endure
and harmonise the world, though fanaticism
has passed away, and though theologic disquisitions
and church histories are now no longer read
or written."</p>

<p>"At least," replied the companion of Grubout
Florid, "no more than their literary merits
permit and we whose weary trade it is to thumb

<!-- vol 3 page 285 -->

through the tens of thousands of controversial
volumes which they have bequeathed to us,
know how truly the curse of dullness has
fallen on their craft."</p>

<p>"True," replied the historian, "who has
given an interest beyond the hour to
the topics they set forth as of eternal
import? How many Bunyans have we in
that legion? How many are there who even
narratively attract our attention now? How
many who, like Butler in his 'Lives of the
Saints,' have ever rendered the odour of
sanctity pleasing? How many who, like
McCabe in his 'Catholic History of England,'
have known how to raise flowers from the dust
of old monkish manuscripts, and to invest the
fruit of their erudite research, the legends of</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">'Grim saints and martyrs hairy.'</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>with all the interest of romance?</p>

<p>"But I too falling into the habits of life,

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

am digressing. I was contending then against
your pessimist impressions, that if we live in
an age in which the worship of Mammon is
predominant, it is tending, to that absurd extreme
from which society will make an abrupt
return, into the true path from which it wandered
sixty years ago.</p>

<p>"A cross road was before it then, it missed its
way, and here we are&mdash;not retrograded&mdash;not
where we were&mdash;not where we might have
been&mdash;but though swamped in a quagmire and
drawn up by a dead wall, yet not so far out of
the true direction, when we choose to take a
short cut into it.</p>

<p>"We have attained the abolition of old abuses,
the amalgamation of hostile castes and nationalities;
and if this had been brought about by
a fraternisation of human interests in accordance
with the benevolent inspirations then so
rife, the world would not need a revolution now
to set it right; but the change was allowed to
be effected in the mere spirit of lucre, and that

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

spirit rose into an ascendancy, which has
become a greater ill than the evils it removed.</p>

<p>"The Frenchman and the Englishman became
one, not as common members of the great
human family, but as fellow-shareholders in the
paramount rights of property, or as hopeless
victims of the same impression. Free trade&mdash;which
benevolence would have used to level
frontiers, became the instrument of a monopoly&mdash;the
monopoly of the Haves against the
Have nots."</p>

<p>"But," said Grubout's companion, "did
not this deification of the rights of property&mdash;which
has led society into its present dilemma,
now that property has passed, by virtue
of it, into one man's hands&mdash;did not this
originate in that first half of the last century,
to which you look back with such complacence?"</p>

<p>"Because my thoughts recur not to its fatal
errors nor to the unhappy spirit which prevailed,
but to the militant aspirations which

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

succumbed, at last, yet bid so fair to become
triumphant that all parties at one time paid
them tribute. There was a period when none
dared avow the naked selfishness of principle.
When Toryism became Conservatism split off
into philanthropic advocacy of free trade,
leaving only&mdash;as a surviving chip of the original
block&mdash;protectionist obduracy which itself
fought the question of Corn-Law Monopoly.
with the arms of Anti-Slavery sympathies.</p>

<p>"The leader of that Young England whose
political formula was a vaguely expansive benevolence,
was eagerly appropriated by the
protectionists, and a sharp weapon the Benjamin
of his party became. For protection
had figuratively, as well as nominally, its
Benjamin&mdash;its well beloved in him&mdash;no less
than its Joseph, in Lord George. At least
if to such analogy suffice the monopoly of corn
in the land of Egypt, and the coat of many
colours now conjectured to have been a racing-jacket,
the only reasonable solution, since

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

the alternative of supposing Jacob to have
presented his son with a harlequin's coat,
would clearly be far from respectful to the
memory of that patriarch.</p>

<p>"The protectionists, it may be observed, even
in their misfortune&mdash;even when Sir Robert Peel
had played the Marotto&mdash;and even when their
old oracles were all struck dumb, exemplified
the adage 'that it is better to be born lucky
than wise,' for driven to recruit in the stable
and on the highway, this party without a
leader found in D'Israeli a leader without a
party, and lighted on Lord George Bentinck
who soon made manifest the truth&mdash;which no
one conversant with the turf had ever doubted&mdash;that
its knowing ones were safe to shine
amongst statesmen and politicians, though
whether statesmen or politicians would cut an
equal figure on the turf is still problematical,
and no more follows than that because a mare
is a horse, a horse should be a mare.</p>

<p>"Even the versatile Lord Brougham (when

<!-- vol 3 page 290 -->

having purchased at third hand Lord George's
stud, he aspired to the sovereignty Lord
George had abdicated,) did not succeed in
making up a more successful book than his
novel of the 'Chateau Lunel, or the Castle of
Languedoc' turned out to be.</p>

<p>"Lord George, as far as skill and energy
could help him, deserved if he did not command
success, but protection was a cocktail
jade, whom no jockeying could bring to the
winning-post, and he was riding against Free
trade carrying feather weight.</p>

<p>"Yet it must be recorded of him, that not
only an able, but a consistent man, he proved
his moral training by squaring his political
conduct according to the principles and experience
of his private avocations, since&mdash;impressed
with the elementary stable-truth that
a horse can never be brought into condition
without limiting his feeds of corn&mdash;the efforts
of his policy were directed towards stinting
the corn of the people.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

<p>"As to the Protectionist Benjamin he was perhaps
better fitted than Sir Robert to have transmitted to
posterity a name which has only come
down to us in connexion with his hostility to
that minister whose immortality is due to the
greatness of the measures which he passed
when they had overtaken him.</p>

<p>"No one had ever held out greater literary
and political promise than D'Israeli; gifted with
eloquence of pen and tongue, his works impressed
you with the conviction of originality
and talent beyond those of his most favoured
contemporaries&mdash;less positively evidenced in
his works than irresistibly attributed by the
reader to the writer.</p>

<p>"He belonged to a persecuted race, degraded
by centuries of oppression, and held in opprobrium
for its degradation, yet he made his
way by his own talents without denial of his
origin&mdash;the besetting sin of the Hebrews. On
the contrary, he gloried in belonging to a people,

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

who more appropriately might have
gloried in its connection with him, since few,
even in the Biblical times of its history, could
have afforded it such just cause of pride.</p>

<p>"And in saying this, I am not forgetful, even
of the poetic genius and traditionary wisdom
of David's son.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether there is not more
poetry in the works of D'Israeli, than in the
songs of Solomon, and as to the sapience of that
day, it must have differed as widely from the
wisdom of our own, as the speed of those times
from what we consider sharp travelling&mdash;or else
the palm of wisdom could never have been conceded
to a monarch so ill-advised as voluntarily to
cohabit with six hundred wives, thus incurring
the penalty our revised criminal code awards
to the Bigamist now condemned to live with
the two or more females he has married.</p>

<p>"It is at least doubtful whether Saul would
have had the boldness, or Solomon the eloquence

<!-- vol 3 page 293 -->

to have turned the tables on those
illiberally carping at his origin by startling
John Bull not only into a salutary conviction
of his ill-founded prejudice towards a race
maligned, but actually, for a whole week, into
the belief that there was neither worth, birth,
nor talent out of the Jewish pale.</p>

<p>"Every illustrious name, of which the origin
was obscure, he appropriated, for his tribe,
till honest John&mdash;before the midway truth
dawned upon him between depreciation of the
Jewish race and this excessive exaltation of
the Hebrew horn&mdash;was in hourly expectation
that the Duke of Wellington and Lord John
Russell would next turn out Mosaic Arabs,
and the grandfather of Sir Robert prove to
have been a son of the circumcised.</p>

<p>"Was it surprising that after accomplishing
such a feat he should have gained the ear of
England and succeeded in rendering so plain
the political ridicules and errors of all shades of

<!-- vol 3 page 294 -->

opinion, that partisans felt half disgusted
with, or quite ashamed of, their respective
parties?&mdash;or that the Young England banner
which he raised should have gleamed spotless
and bright as a star of hope amidst the
tattered rags to which he had directed public
scorn?</p>

<p>"Was it surprising that men should have
looked forward to one who had so well exposed
the past, as to a guide for the future, and that
expectation should have seen in him, the embryo
leader of a new and progressive
party?</p>

<p>"No man had ever attained, by sheer brilliancy,
so remarkable a position, and none ever
so signally disappointed the anticipations he
had raised.</p>

<p>"In his Coningsby&mdash;when breaking a Rigby
on his own wheel, he derides the use of italics
as the resource of 'Forcible Feebles,' and then
resorts to printing words in capitals&mdash;the inconsistence
is typical of that which his political

<!-- vol 3 page 295 -->

opinions exhibited. The keen expositor of cant,
abuse and wrong, who dragged into light and
ridicule the follies of the day, proposes a
remedy more monstrous than its worst disease&mdash;the
revival of institutions tried during centuries,
found wanting and condemned by the
common accord of all civilised people to whom
the choice had ever been given.</p>

<p>"Redoubtable whilst shaking and trampling
down, he seemed impotent to construct. When
on the blank flag, which the imagination of his
admirers had filled with the symbols of their
respective faiths, he came dimly to inscribe his
own&mdash;what did they behold? A fanciful
amalgamation of obsolete monarchical and high
church traditions, tempered with benevolent
aspirations, and tending, if anywhere, towards
absolutism&mdash;in an age of steam, iron, energy
and progression!</p>

<p>"The mountain had brought forth the mouse
and the man who had alternately held out the
promise of undisputed pre-eminence in the

<!-- vol 3 page 296 -->

fields of literature and of politics, sunk into
the second novelist of his time&mdash;the pest of a
political adversary, and the pet of a superannuated
party.</p>

<p>"The opinion was long entertained by the
Protectionists, that Sir Robert Peel was born
entirely without a conscience; and if so, it is
not improbable that Providence, to render
him amenable to some counter-poising sting,
raised up a D'Israeli, as the supplementary
conscience of a Sir Robert.</p>

<p>"At least, up to 1846, he had played no other
part&mdash;though I may chance to do his subsequent
reputation injustice, as I have not
happened to disinter any important record of
him after this time."</p>

<p>"But," said the historian's guest, "if you
have done, pray what do you intend to prove
by all this?"</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the historian, with the air of
a man suddenly recollecting himself, "my hobby
has run away with me. I was endeavouring

<!-- vol 3 page 297 -->

to show how the first half of the nineteenth
century, before it went so lamentably astray,
was manifesting, in innumerable forms, its
philanthropic tendencies, whether we refer to
anti-slavery or anti-poor-law agitation, whether
to temperance movements, or societies to befriend
the homeless, to increase the comfort of the
poor, or protective of needlewomen, factory
children, aborigines, or animals.</p>

<p>"So general was the extension of this feeling
that none could any more afford to dispense
with benevolent pretensions than with the
tricoloured cockade in the reign of terror, or
with a holy relic in the middle ages.</p>

<p>"Rosas, an obscure South American despot of
those times, thought it necessary to preface
his butchery with fair words, and Nicholas,
who had peopled more graves than all his contemporary
sovereigns put together,&mdash;who had
transported a quarter of a million of his subjects,
into penal banishment,&mdash;who owned
twenty millions as his private slaves, and in

<!-- vol 3 page 298 -->

whose dominions more men died annually by
the executioner's hand than in all the rest of
Europe&mdash;even Nicholas found it expedient to
join an anti-slavery league, and when the pretence
of no punishment of death existing in
his dominions would no longer impose upon
the civilised world,&mdash;when it had learned that
the knout was more cruel and no less murderous
than the knife or rope&mdash;thought fit to
change its name, and to substitute the no
less fatal <i>plitt</i> which gives the executioner's
arm more trouble.</p>

<p>"Even Monsieur Samson was forced to contend
that he sharpened the steel of his guillotine
through '<i>z&egrave;le humanitaire</i>,' and I have found
somewhere in the posthumous memoirs of Mr.
Calcraft that he had exercised his calling
through mere consideration of the interests
of his kind, since his strongly developed organs
of destructiveness might otherwise have induced
him to destroy some one not otherwise
doomed to die."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 299 -->

<p>"Well," said Grubout's companion, "I have
small sympathy with the men of your favourite
period, for whose errors, according to your
confession, we are suffering. If, as you suppose,
Great Britain then led the van of civilisation,
referring to the daily press of that
time and country, what a cowardly truckling
to successful crime&mdash;a Russian Tsar, or an
Egyptian Pacha&mdash;what did it signify? Why,
a Lord Aberdeen in those days could not have
borne to hear that a Khan of Bokhara had
behaved in a manner unbecoming a Christian
or a gentleman. As Mrs. Norton says, 'he
could not have believed it of him.' A true
sample of his epoch, he had no censure for any
but deposed princes.</p>

<p>"Now to prove that society knew better, as
you are striving, would make it only more
despicable. I can see in this subservience to
success only a manifestation of the same contemptible
spirit which made John Bull bow
with such servile delight to every stray prince,

<!-- vol 3 page 300 -->

and bend, in the worship of title and aristocracy,
long after the influence of both had
been virtually exploded throughout Europe."</p>

<p>"As to the first part of your argument I have
nothing to say," replied the historian "as regards
the second, John Bull, before his individuality
was merged in the great European family, had
undoubtedly a servile hankering after princely
and aristocratic greatness. But then he only
esteemed aristocracy when really invested with
authority and power. He despised a French
Count, a German Baron, and an Italian Marquis,
to bow to an English Lord, whilst Princes
he seems, on the contrary, only to have prized,
irrespective of all other qualifications, for
sheer novelty. He would have made no invidious
distinction between a Russian Tsar and
a prince of Monaco, but lavished his enthusiasm
with undiscriminating impartiality provided
they did not, like the King of Saxony,
outstay their welcome. If very outlandish, the
son or nephew, or even the representative of a

<!-- vol 3 page 301 -->

sovereign or ruler sufficed to draw down plaudits.
Ibrahim Pacha was quite as welcome as
the King of Prussia, and the envoy of the
Imaum of Muscat more sought after by John
Bull than either, because he had never in his
life heard either of the territory or title of the
potentate in question. An announcement in
the court circular, of the arrival of the King
of Cockaigne, or of the grand Panjandrum
would at any moment have elicited the liveliest
sympathies of the public, and the courtesies of
the Lord Mayor, whilst the King of the Mosquito
shore, or a distant connexion of that Queen
of Madagascar who offered to cede the sovereignty
of her dominions to an English merchant
captain for the consideration of a bottle
of rum and an old red coat, would undoubtedly
have been received with more applause than
the stale King of the Belgians.</p>

<p>"But this weakness might be referred to the
love of cheap sight-seeing which characterised
honest John. His warm reception of distinguished

<!-- vol 3 page 302 -->

visitors owed its sole origin to thankfulness
for the gratuitous exhibition with which
they favoured him, and as his thoughts reverted
to Madame Tussaud's, he regarded the illustrious
personages in question with complacence,
as the public spirited saviours of his shillings.
Hence he looked with disgust upon a Prince
who staid too long, or came too often; hence
his ardor was damped by a sovereign who wore
plain clothes; and hence even when his expectations
were overwrought by any great singularity
of costume, as in the case of Ibrahim
Pacha, he felt disappointed if not aggrieved,
when his Highness neither threw somersets on
a small carpet, nor played with the cup and
balls, nor balanced a dagger on his nose.</p>

<p>"This mania for jumping down the throats of
royal lions originated therefore in the same
feeling which made the public insist on sixpenny
and shilling exhibitions, and crowd to
see all gratis sights, and to attend all free
meetings. It had nothing to do with John

<!-- vol 3 page 303 -->

Bull's tuft-hunting propensities. Ludicrously
as these were developed, he confined them
to his own aristocracy, which continued to
exist in England long after its extinction
everywhere besides.</p>

<p>"Now that it is become a thing of the past,
whilst we wonder at its perpetuation with so
practical a people, at an epoch in which the
dawn of a true civilisation had commenced,
we may at the same time admit, that the
aristocracy to which John Bull bowed the
knee, was a very different stamp to that which
withered beneath Continental contempt. Now
that it no longer bars the way to a happier
state of things, nor fills the place of a more
perfect social organisation, it must be confessed
that mixed up with recollections of its follies
and vices, it has bequeathed to posterity some
glorious memories. It was not quite unworthy

most fruitful germ of human fraternisation.
Small in extent, if it proved a fruitful hotbed
of vice, folly, egotism, and meanness, it also
brought forward a luxuriant crop of all
those qualities of heart, intellect, and imagination,
which elevate, dazzle, and refine. From
its limited ranks, in the commencement of the
nineteenth century, it furnished the greatest
poet, the most accomplished captain, the most
learned scholar, and the most daring seaman
its country ever witnessed; and it sent forth
its scions in every enterprise of science, philanthropy,
or hardihood.</p>

having played a more successful part upon a
wider stage. Lord John Russell shines no less
as the historian than as the statesman. Lord
Mahon holds a distinguished place amongst
contemporary historians. Lord Prudhoe, second in
the world as an oriental antiquarian, was
second to Champollion. Lord Stanhope made
the first material improvements in the printing
press. Lord Rosse devoted the ingenuity
of years, inventing his own tools and
feeling his own way, to accomplish, in the
pursuit of science, what mechanical art had
never yet achieved, and what states and princes
had hitherto left undone. He had the proud
satisfaction of extending the vision of his
race further than it had ever reached into the
regions of immensity.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE TRIAL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Eustatius Cash</span>, though neither distinguished
for intellect nor boldness, still possessed sufficient
of both to enable him to perceive the
advantages of his position, and prompt him
unscrupulously to employ them. Though,
with moderate means, he might have been a
timid man, the immense resources at his command
led him to carry out his views with a
reckless hardihood which no intercession could

<!-- vol 3 page 308 -->

temper, because,&mdash;conscious that he might be
led,&mdash;he was so morbidly suspicious of all
influence that he could not be made amenable
to any, whether for good or evil.</p>

<p>His first step had been to beggar his father-in-law
whose property absorbed, a second time by
old Cash, had passed with the untestated wealth
of the millionary to his son. His next was
against the Lady Calliro&euml;, who boldly threatened
to sue him for maintenance, and whom he
menaced with divorce.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; defied&mdash;his counsellors
dissuaded&mdash;him from prosecution of his suit;
but he was inflexible. His fiat went forth.
He determined to drag her in the dust, and
the green bag was deposited upon the table of
the senate.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the Lady Calliro&euml; entered into
communication with Tempest. It was not to
call on him for the exculpatory evidence he
could furnish, but to throw her cause on his
political protection. His advocacy was not

<!-- vol 3 page 309 -->

denied her. Pass we over their mutual
thoughts, over the strange memories and association
which troubled this young wife and her
defender when meeting to concert the defence
he had undertaken, because the dark communications
made&mdash;the subjects dwelt on&mdash;in these
witnessed interviews, left little room for aught
present besides anxiety and horror. The injured
lady of Eustatius revealed to Tempest
the parricidal scene to which her ears, if not
her eyes, had borne witness.</p>

<p>With the accusation of that murder she
boldly proposed to meet the calumnious accusations
by which her husband sought to disgrace
her; and through her the grey hair of
her father.</p>

<p>Days passed. The Lady Calliro&euml;'s name became
the popular watchword. The struggle
between the husband and the wife grew to
be identified with antagonism between the
people and its despot. Expectation was raised
to the highest pitch. Fresh efforts were made

<!-- vol 3 page 310 -->

to induce her to retire from the contest, but
she remained inflexible, neither shaken by
threats, nor moved by the opprobrium with
which the party of Eustatius basely covered her.</p>

<p>Of her means of defence even the senator,
her father, was ignorant; but so long used to
defer to her sagacity, even he acquired confidence
from that which she exhibited, and
from the knowledge of Tempest's advocacy
which she had secured.</p>

<p>At length the eventful time is come. The
capital is crowded, the streets are thronged;
the military keep the people in awe. The
boys fight in the street for my lady or my
lord. The pampered coachmen of the members
fillip with their whips such of the mob as
toss up their greasy bonnets, and shout for the
accused. They have a right to do so. These
equipages are mortgaged to their master's
master; and, if he wills it, to-morrow their
present owners must trudge it on foot, and
Jehu's occupation would be no more. Such

<!-- vol 3 page 311 -->

is the feeling which in an ascending scale inspires
the devotion of the husband's party.
But there were two exceptions. The Lady Floranthe
gorgeously attired waits to receive and
congratulate the victor; and, on her part, the
Lady Sabina sits throned in state, with her fair,
young, gentle daughter by her side, in a like
expectation. The triumph of Eustatius will
that day leave free his hand, the prize for
which they are contending, and Eustatius still
pretentious of the character of the Lovelace
and Lothario has inspired both with hope.</p>

<p>Within the senate Tempest sits calm but
thoughtful. All the sinews of party which
furnish his hold on the great body of the
people are strained like the tendons of a
mighty limb in the repose preceding action.
He meditates a daring measure. Why not
now, if ever, attempt to break the despot's
power? Why not retaliate with an annihilating
charge his base attempt to crush a woman?
Why not now attack him as the parricide in

<!-- vol 3 page 312 -->

that assembly, and suddenly hold out to his
partisans the seducing prospect of disenthralment
from his influence by suggesting the
confiscation of his wealth, as a felon's forfeit
to the state? This momentous problem the
popular leader has solved affirmatively.</p>

<p>He sits with compressed lips expecting the
appearance of the Lady Calliro&euml;. It is the
eve of the eventful moment in which rising
before his peers, the young wife, so renowned
for her beauty and her wisdom, has undertaken
to denounce to that wonder-stricken assembly
the old man's murder and her husband's
crime.</p>

<p>The time is come&mdash;the minutes are passing&mdash;where
is she? His eyes are fixed upon that
door, through which he expects that she will
come sailing in with regal dignity. He saw
her not an hour ago she was calm and collected
then&mdash;no pulse seemed to throb quicker&mdash;her
demeanor was that of grave, resolute,
reflective determination?</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 313 -->

<p>Or has her energy, at the eleventh hour,
given way! have the feelings she restrained overpowered
her! and if so&mdash;if in tears&mdash;she comes
in supported on her father's arm, not as the
heroine, but as the woman, that too will tell!</p>

<p>At this moment a paper is put into his hand,
can he read aright? The Lady Calliro&euml; declines
to fulfil the part she had pledged herself
to play! She has deliberately withdrawn
from the contest&mdash;she submits to the infamy of
defeat&mdash;she thanks her defender, but is now on
her way to seek refuge in obscurity!</p>

<p>There has been no coercion; the trustworthy
bearer of that missive saw her pen it&mdash;alone&mdash;uninfluenced
by menace. Whilst Tempest
ponders in a state of stupefaction, the appointed
representative stands forth into the
place of the accused, and declares, that the
Lady Calliro&euml; Cash declines to appear, but
submits to the contumacious judgment of that
august assembly.</p>

<p>He has not yet recovered from the shock

<!-- vol 3 page 314 -->

when the despot's wife is branded by the recorded
vote of that venal senate as the confessed
adultress.</p>

<p>The sentence is passed, her civil death decreed.
Henceforth devote to infamy her name,
whom the representatives of a nation have
banned with such solemnity!</p>

<p>Let her reputation&mdash;tattered rag&mdash;be
dragged by malignity through the kennel's
mire! Be her shame on every tongue&mdash;her ignominy
borne on every wind that wafts the insulting
cries of the crapulous multitude paid
for those shouts that gratify the vindictive
husband's ear.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>It is nearly three quarters of an hour since
an old man, accompanied by a female closely
muffled up and veiled, and both in humble
guise have been journeying towards the station.
By this time they should be far away, but whether

<!-- vol 3 page 315 -->

their driver is drunk or confused by the
crowd, or dares not urge his horse past a certain
turning, at which the animal resolutely
shies, it is certain that they have been retracing
their steps, or turning round in a circle.</p>

<p>The mob impedes their progress. Its shouts,
its jeers, its comments distinctly reach the
ears of those within the now stationary vehicle.
Suddenly the old man throws up the sash, he
calls for water, his companion is faint and
ill. He lifts her out of the vehicle into the
air, but she is now insensible, and his arm, enfeebled by age, cannot support her. This scene,
which is passing opposite a mansion, attracts
the attention of a young girl from the balcony.
Aid comes. The sufferer is borne into an
apartment of that house, and its benevolent
daughter leans over her, and enquires into
the nature of what she apprehends to be an
accident.</p>

<p>The mother of the fair benevolent comes
gently to recall her from her labour of love&mdash;but

<!-- vol 3 page 316 -->

starts with astonishment, and at this
moment the stranger opens her eyes. The
ribaldry of the crowd is still ringing in her
ear&mdash;what humiliation is this? Where has
her bewildered father led her? How comes
the Lady Sabina&mdash;and that daughter the reputed
cause of her persecution&mdash;to be before
the Lady Calliro&euml;'s eyes?</p>

<p>"Good God," said the Lady Sabina's husband,
"this is very awkward."</p>

<p>With a burning brow and a flashing eye
the senator's daughter starts up, and meets
the mother's glance of scorn, the daughter's
gaze of pity. It is her turn now to support
the old man's tottering steps over that threshold.
There pass no words between them,
but when, old Lofty and his child have vanished,
the tears rise into the eyes of the Lady Sabina's
daughter.</p>

<p>"That is his wife! Oh! is it not pitiful?"</p>

<p>"She <i>was</i> his wife," replied the mother.
"As you may be. Therefore such compassion
ill becomes you."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 317 -->

<p>"Oh! never," said the young girl with a look
of horror, "you would never wish to see me
treated thus?"</p>

<p>"She is guilty," said the Lady Sabina.</p>

<p>"Oh! not even if I were ten thousand times
guilty!"</p>

<p>"True!" said the Lady Sabina's husband.
"It is very sad. She is worse than guilty
because condemned&mdash;but innocent as you are."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the Lady Sabina, conscience
stricken.</p>

<p>"As I live she is guiltless," replied the
husband. "Have not I been employed to sift
the evidence?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" said the Lady Sabina, faltering,
"this is not an act of stern justice, but a
crime."</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the daughter, "how irreverently
they shout her name&mdash;if they should
recognise her, as well turn her loose to a pack
of hounds! Perhaps she came to seek refuge
from them here. Oh! God if I were

<!-- vol 3 page 318 -->

hunted thus I should lie down and die."</p>

<p>This image of her daughter in such plight
struck home remorse to the mother's heart.</p>

<p>"Good God! and have I refused her shelter?
You say guiltless! To profit by such
a calumny would be crime. She shall find
protection here."</p>

<p>"What! and her husband expected?" said
the spouse.</p>

<p>"No," said the Lady Sabina, "Eustatius
shall not be received. If innocent, she is still
his wife before the face of heaven. My
daughter shall never see him more."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! hush!" said the husband,
you are both beside yourselves&mdash;both in the
other extreme. Refuse to receive Eustatius
forsooth!"</p>

<p>But as he speaks, the foot of Eustatius is
on the stairs. He comes in all the self-complacent
fatuity long since parodied from the

<!-- vol 3 page 319 -->

demeanour of Julian, and now insufferably
increased by the jubilation of triumph. But
no felicitations greet him. Is he dreaming?
Has he escaped from overwhelming adulation
only to plunge into this frigid atmosphere?</p>

<p>The Lady Sabina, cold, haughty, and majestic,
as a Medea, meets him with the regret
"that she cannot congratulate him on his
success."</p>

<p>Eustatius is thunder-stricken&mdash;the Lady Sabina's
husband deprived of all power of speech,
by this astounding rashness. He knows how
irrecoverably all is over, for when will Eustatius,
who has never pardoned an unintentional
slight, forgive a premeditated insult? But in
an instant the brow of the suitor darkens.</p>

<p>"Is this my reception, madam! when honouring
your roof?"</p>

<p>"I shall esteem my roof none the less
honoured, when no longer harbouring successful
calumny."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 320 -->

<p>"<i>Your</i> roof!" said Eustatius, pale and almost
speechless with anger and surprise.
"<i>Your</i> roof! Who has a roof they can call
their own? Go into the provinces and learn,
madam! or stay here, and by heaven you shall
acquire the knowledge!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE EXERCISE OF A RIGHT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> are those wretched beings, men, women,
and children, toiling along the road, or encamped
by the wayside for miles, moving on
wearily in a continuous procession of misery,
or straggling in isolated groups, or congregating
into crowds to seek repose?</p>

<p>The ashes of innumerable fires&mdash;or such
traces as they have left, where, without even
fuel, they have passed the night, or paused to

<!-- vol 3 page 322 -->

rest&mdash;show that this human stream has been
for many weeks been flowing.</p>

<p>It is no pilgrimage like that when a million
of votaries hastened in 1844 to visit the holy
coat of Treves, because the travel-worn multitude
bear with them their household gear
and even their domestic animals. Some of
the lean kine and valueless beasts of burthen,
and here and there a hungry dog follow
amidst these Penates.</p>

<p>Though a military force observes and follows
those wayfarers&mdash;preventing retrogression&mdash;it
is not a Jewish population, or the
inhabitants of a Polish district, driven before
the Cossack lances into the waste by the ukase
of a Tsar.</p>

<p>The Tsars have been long as completely
extinct as the Mammoth&mdash;these wanderers are
neither quite despoiled, nor chained, and he
who sends them forth upon their journey does
not regard them as a herd of cattle, arrogating
an inhuman property in his fellow men, but

<!-- vol 3 page 323 -->

only scatters them on that highway in pursuance
of his right to do what he thinks fit
with what is legitimately his own.</p>

<p>Such a spectacle the population of Athens may
have afforded, when gathering in the Piraeus to
escape the Persian host&mdash;such the nations migrating
before the irruption of the Goth, and
Hun into the Roman territories&mdash;such the
multitudes disturbed by the advance of the
Tamerlane's exterminating hordes&mdash;and such
the wayfarers flying from war, pestilence, and
famine.</p>

<p>The multitude crowding this road is the
wreck of a people whom disease and hunger
has decimated, flying from a calamity, and
that calamity is the mischance which has
transferred the possession of their mother earth
to a stranger, and made him merciless.</p>

<p>Eustatius, their landlord, has simply been
<i>ejecting</i> them. Here and there he has given
a whole province or a whole county <i>notice to
quit</i>. They are in arrears, who can dispute

<!-- vol 3 page 324 -->

his right, and who would dare gainsay it if
they could? Has he not the strong arm of
the law, the military force at his beck, and&mdash;well
paid, whilst the general bankruptcy
heightens the value of their wages&mdash;to whom,
if not to him, would his stalwart men be
true.</p>

<p>Has he not the example too of the Irish
landlord of yore; and better still of the great
Western Scottish proprietors, the chiefs of
clans, who&mdash;owing their lord to the rude
devotion of their clansmen's sires&mdash;drove them out
when they could dispense with their fidelity
and their claymore to make place for the sheep
and the red deer.</p>

<p>Eustatius Cash, in certain provinces, has
warned all trespassers off his grounds&mdash;that
ground is the whole province. No doubt he
has his reasons&mdash;but if not&mdash;if his mere whim&mdash;has
he not the right? Why should not he
exclude all men, if he thinks proper, from land
which is his own, as well as a Duke of Leeds

<!-- vol 3 page 325 -->

have barred all passages through a district
which he hired some sixty years ago?</p>

<p>Country seats abandoned by their ruined
owners have been dismantled&mdash;whole villages
are untenanted&mdash;and only here and there the
smoke curls jovially up from the chimneys of
some tenement, in which the well-paid agents
of the landlord, superintending this depopulation,
make merry amidst the general desolation.</p>

<p>The deep traces of the railways burrowed
through the heart of the hills, and severing
their crests, still furrow the surface of the land
as indelibly as the convulsions of nature, which
have left on it their impress, but the rails are
taken up.</p>

<p>The hedge-rows still plot out the fallow field,
but the briar is rising densely amidst its
weeds.</p>

<p>Do you see that neglected harbour which no
mast gladdens now&mdash;and across whose mouth
the breakers glisten on the bar? That roofless

<!-- vol 3 page 326 -->

town, over which the crumbling factory chimneys
nod, that deserted village in which here
and there, some obstinate trespasser&mdash;who saw
the light in its cottage, and whose sires lie
buried in its church-yard&mdash;still lingers by
stealth? Do you see that baronial castle
fast decaying to the ruinous condition in which,
sixty years ago, the bankrupt linen&mdash;draper
purchased it?</p>

<p>The bat flits through its noble galleries&mdash;the
spider weaves over them its grey pall&mdash;the
swallow builds within instead of without those
paneless windows, and the hooting of the owl
responds to the loud wheezing of its solitary
and clandestine tenant; the seneschal, Hugh
Fitz-Stephen Upland, who has been rendered
asthmatic by the dampness of those dilapidated
walls.</p>

<p>And do you, Reader, recognise Upland
Castle? For those two travellers would not, but
for the old oak trees, whose familiar trunks are
still the same, and whose unaltered boughs

<!-- vol 3 page 327 -->

rustle as if in derision of the change surrounding
them.</p>

<p>One of these travellers is a woman, young
and fair, though care-worn. The other, a man
rather old and grey with sorrow than with
years, and upon whose countenance, the expression
of recent vexation, and present bitterness
is mingled with the trace of long and
deeply graven humiliation and grief.</p>

<p>That voyager was once the owner of all his
humid eyes survey; and&mdash;broken, beggared,
humbled, on his alienated patrimony&mdash;the once
proud Lord Lofty, has just been stung
by a last instance of what he deems ingratitude.</p>

<p>The old seneschal, who clings with cat-like
tenacity to those walls, and who had eaten his
bread from childhood upwards, has received his
former master, not only with all the stately
stiffness with which he was wont to usher an
awed visitor into the presence of the

<!-- vol 3 page 328 -->

castle's lord, but actually with irony and sarcasm.</p>

<p>His devotion had been to the owner of his
ancestral castle, and forfeiting that character,
the man remained simply odious, as no one who
had usurped&mdash;and was no longer dignified by&mdash;the
possession of Upland.</p>

<p>"I beg you to observe," said the old gentleman;
"that we have nothing in common, except
the fact, that your father and some score
of my ancestors once held possession of this
domain, and that we are both on some equality
now as to worldly wealth;" here the seneschal
glanced complacently from his darned trousers'
knee at the dusty garments of the way-worn
traveller. "Beyond that&mdash;all other differences
being levelled&mdash;there is now, sir, the distinction
between my blue blood and your plebeian
breeding&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This after all my favours&mdash;all my condescension?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 329 -->

<p>"The condescension you will find, I think,
to have been on the part of Hugh Fitz-Stephen
Upland! You men of the desk and counter,
superseded us through your gold, you pinned
your faith to gold alone&mdash;it has failed you, and
you are nothing without it. My ancestors
gave this place their name&mdash;it grew reputed
through their deeds&mdash;but you leave neither
name nor memory here. You tenanted these
halls for a brief space, nothing further, you
passed away, and so will he who owns them,
but as surely as those old oaks remain, so will
the race of Fitz-Stephen Upland, to re-assume
it right some day."</p>

<p>And with these words, the old man withdrew
after a courtly salutation, but not to see his
prediction verified, because that day twelvemonth,
an erratic chimney-pot, alighting on his
head, extinguished in his person, the ancient
line which he had thus far perpetuated.</p>

<p>It had so chanced that the Senator had

<!-- vol 3 page 330 -->

never till this day returned to Upland, since
the deceptive marriage on which he had illusively
counted for re-establishment of his
fortunes, little imagining that the subtle
tempter only gave to take back again the advantages
which he had conceded.</p>

<p>The ruin surrounding him where he had
left all so prosperous, the associations of a
scene which vividly recalled the ambitious
hopes he had entertained, and the bitter disappointment
of that old man&mdash;who now
stood beggared on his own hearth with his
dishonoured daughter&mdash;overcame him with
emotion.</p>

<p>He tottered across the park upon his daughter's
arm. They reached some dilapidated
cottages, and then&mdash;feeling faint&mdash;he sat down
upon a mound of earth, beside the cottage
door, over which hung a vine in all the rank
luxuriance of unpruned tendrils, with reddening
leaves and fruit withering on the stem, or

<!-- vol 3 page 331 -->

devastated by birds, blight, or insects, excepting
one solitary bunch which hung temptingly
near the weary wayfarer.</p>

<p>But the full, dark, glossy bulb which he
raises to his lips, bursts with a crackling
sound. It is not swollen with the juicy pulp
which nourishes and refreshes, but filled like
the bloated leaves which droop, fruit-like from
the hedge-rows&mdash;with a black, pungent, bitter
dust!</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the tempestuous strife of
jarring elements&mdash;amidst the wreck of navies
going down&mdash;some perishable relic floats safely
on the wild waves to the shore. And in the
same manner trivial incidents&mdash;forgotten on
the morrow&mdash;sometimes rise uppermost in the
memory, after the grave vicissitudes which
have marred a life.</p>

<p>Whilst that bitterness is still upon his
loathing lips, there flashes across his memory
a recollection no less bitter, as he suddenly
recalls the bunch of grapes he had refused

<!-- vol 3 page 332 -->

the dying man. On principle it was true&mdash;the
principle which had made him that which he
was now. In some of these cottages, too, he
now remembered that the old man had lived&mdash;and
died perhaps for he had never inquired.</p>

<p>"Get up! get up!" mumbled a cracked
voice in his ear, as his spare arm was clasped
by a still bonnier hand, "you mustn't sit there
upon my neighbour. That is no seat for
tramps and idlers. That is a grave! 'Bury
me there, dame Gabble, where my chair was
used to stand in the sunset, and plant a thorn
at my head, and a vine-slip at my feet,' the
old man used to say, and there he lies, God
rest him! we digged him in with a broken
spade&mdash;the youth and I&mdash;<i>he</i> sleeps outside,
and the youth sleeps in; you must not disturb
either," said the old crone pointing into
her cottage.</p>

<p>Dame Gabble was little changed in person
or condition. How could she alter much?

<!-- vol 3 page 333 -->

What could the desolation around add to her
loneliness? Of what could the myrmidons of
Eustatius deprive her? Her life cannot long
interrupt the solitude, and therefore they have
left her its only privileged denizen.</p>

<p>But though she has a memory her perception
is imperfect and slow. The Lady Calliro&euml;
cannot induce her to bring water, she
steps into the cottage&mdash;and lo! the old crone
has spoken truth&mdash;the old galvanist's companion&mdash;Tempest&mdash;lies
extended there, not in
the arms of death but of sleep!</p>

<p>Even the intrusion of her light footstep
rouses him. He recognises and addresses her.
His travelling dress, the associations which
invest that locality with so deep an interest
for him, no less than for her account for his
presence there.</p>

<p>"How strange that we should thus meet
Lady!" said Tempest, "after all the search
that I have set on foot."</p>

<p>"Why should you have sought one who deceived

<!-- vol 3 page 334 -->

her generous defender, one who fled
ignominiously from the contest she had
invoked, and whose flight must have thrown
on her the imputation of guilt?" Asked
the Lady Calliro&euml; with fluttering heart
for now&mdash;come to a sense of the vanity
of that ambition which had inspired her when
she quitted this spot to go forth into the world&mdash;it
had become keenly susceptible of impressions
which even then had left on it a trace
indelible.</p>

<p>"No," said Tempest, "always incredulous
of your guilt, I have recently seen your innocence
proven. I have learned how&mdash;to avert
disgrace and danger from a father's head&mdash;you
have bowed your own to obloquy. A deed
was done, just as the doom which stays the incendiary's
hand&mdash;dark as the murder which avenges
murder&mdash;or base as the guilt which slays but
to despoil&mdash;according to the spirit of those participating
in it.</p>

<p>"Whilst that deed was committing your cries

<!-- vol 3 page 335 -->

awakened one who slept&mdash;you told him through
the door that barred all passage outwards
what was being done. He fled for succour&mdash;his
hand had grasped the bell&mdash;he could have
summoned aid, when his arm was staid not by
a blow&mdash;but by a suggestion. A conspirator
had reached him, too late to impede, yet not
too late to tempt him.</p>

<p>" 'In whose favour was the old man's will
made? Who would inherit his wealth, that
boundless wealth?' His hand let fall the rope.
That act was an assassination!"</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml; bowed her head with an
affirmative expression of grief and shame, but
answered nothing.</p>

<p>"Yet there is one thing inexplicable
to me still," said Tempest, "why not have
come to the resolution you adopted before the
eleventh hour?"</p>

<p>"My father," replied the Lady Calliro&euml;,
"had simply a blind confidence, no knowledge
of my plans, and I was ignorant till the last

<!-- vol 3 page 336 -->

of that which I dare not characterise, yet on
which I have acted. With that horrible instrument&mdash;on
the threshold of action&mdash;<i>his</i> ministers
prostrated my unblenching resolution and made
me what I am, the outcast and the fugitive."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Tempest, "we are on the
eve of great events, and if there be no predestination,&mdash;if the wrong be not doomed to
triumph,&mdash;if the narrowest egotism be not fated
to prevail against the cause of human perfectibility&mdash;I
will restore that name, which calumny
has blackened, to all the spotless purity of its
innocence, and the daughter's virtue shall be
the oblivion of the sire's transgression. If so,
believe me, we shall not have met in vain,
either now or at a time which you may scarce
remember&mdash;which I have not forgotten&mdash;when&mdash;restoring
to me my belief in my own kind&mdash;you
saved me from the contagious misanthropy of
that charred and blackened heart to whose
weird shrine my steps have now almost involuntarily
led me."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 337 -->

<p>"<i>No</i>," said the Lady Calliro&euml;, "that interview
I have never forgotten. Your solitary
image has risen in all its simple grandeur,
amidst the hollow greatness which led my
thoughts astray before I had learned to know
that the sole ambition which is not barren for
woman is that which centres in another&mdash;when
that other is great and good&mdash;I have none
now but in your success. My own, I feel,
would not have given me peace; but you, I
trust, have found happiness in your glory."</p>

<p>"What happiness I have found," said Tempest,
with a sigh, "has been disconnected with&mdash;adverse
to&mdash;my ambition. If we had met oftener,
more freely&mdash;if we had read each other's
thoughts&mdash;but what matter, the past can never
be recalled!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p class="small">EUSTATIUS DOES WHAT HE LIKES WITH HIS OWN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span>, it will be asked, could Eustatius Cash
have been so blind to his own interest, as to
depopulate provinces which were his private
property?</p>

<p>"How," it may be asked in reply, "can it
be believed that slave-owners should ever have
maltreated their slaves, or men their cattle, or
despotic princes their subjects?" Because other
passions in the full scope which irresponsible

<!-- vol 3 page 339 -->

power affords, blind men to their grovelling
interests, even as every vicious impulse blinds
them to their true interest...virtue.</p>

<p>Besides&mdash;Eustatius has his peculiar views, his
opinions, and his arguments. Why should he
not be allowed to entertain and practise them
on what is undeniably his own?</p>

<p>He is sitting with a map before him. Middleman
Cautious stands at the same table.
His speech is curt and laconic. His master
has grown morose; and even when most eager
for information, dislikes to hear his servants
talk. To read is still more trouble than to
listen.</p>

<p>"You have consulted the law officers of the
crown?"</p>

<p>Middleman pointed to a bundle of opinions
which he had deposited upon the table.</p>

<p>"Now, constitutionally," said Eustatius,
(he was a great stickler for the constitution,)
"constitutionally speaking&mdash;the rights of property
are paramount to all other. This wise

<!-- vol 3 page 340 -->

principle was, I think, first practically sanctioned
by what is vulgarly called the Bastille
Poor Law, nearly three quarters of a century
ago?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Middleman, "since sanctioned
by repeated enactments, renewed with all
imaginable solemnity during the administration
of your late father."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Eustatius, who winced a little,
but affected no longer to avoid this theme.
"He was not without foresight. From that
principle, proceeded the representation not of
individuals but of property. It grew to be
proportioned to its amount. The deduction
was logical. A given whole represented
society, and every fractional sum a proportional
fragment of its authority. A very comfortable
arrangement now that the whole is my
own. You know that as there is no property
which is not mine&mdash;if I choose to claim it, there
can be no votes but my own, I, therefore&mdash;the
one constituent&mdash;the incarnation of property,

<!-- vol 3 page 341 -->

elect all members, and if they attempt to act
against my will, I break them like a reed; because,
having no <i>bona fide</i> property, they are all
elected under disqualification. They cannot,
therefore, vote away my money. Now, as I
being property am also law&mdash;if I do not choose to
assess or tax myself, how are the poor to be
supported?"</p>

<p>"The poor are the nation," answered Middleman
Cautious.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Eustatius. "But
now mark me, if I exclude them from my
lands and houses, they must take to the high
roads, and from the high roads I can expel them
as vagabonds, without any legitimate object,
threatening my property with depredation?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Middleman Cautious.
"This process you have carried out in
several districts."</p>

<p>"Good," replied Eustatius, running his finger
over the map of Europe. "Let us now
suppose, for argument sake, these intruders on

<!-- vol 3 page 342 -->

my domain&mdash;what matter whether tens of
millions?&mdash;driven from province to province, till
an island or continent is cleared&mdash;then&mdash;even
when crowded into a narrow corner they are
still trespassing. To get rid of them, I must
embark them for another coast, at their
cost, if they could pay, at my own if they cannot.
Am I correct thus far?"</p>

<p>"Undeniably."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" continued Eustatius, "supposing
every continent, every island, every known
land, to be in the same manner my property&mdash;supposing
the whole earth mine, and that I
choose to warn everybody off it, since they
could go nowhere without trespass, and since
trespassing where they remain&mdash;what if I drive
them into the sea?"</p>

<p>"It would be murder," answered Middleman.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Eustatius, "but how does
the law assist me in such a case?"</p>

<p>"That," said Middleman Cautious, after

<!-- vol 3 page 343 -->

a pause; "is a question for the twelve
judges."</p>

<p>"Then," continued Eustatius, "I will show
you how I can solve it. Though it may be
murder to drive your pauper into the river or
the sea, it is none to starve him; he was often
starved before the rights of property were
rigorously defined, when the sentimentalist was
still abroad.</p>

<p>"I am not bound to waste my substance upon
the multitude any more than upon the individual,
therefore I may pen it up and cease to
feed it, and so I might legally and constitutionally
remain the last man if I chose."</p>

<p>"I cannot gainsay your theoretic right,"
said Middleman Cautious, "but economically
considered the exercise of it would be suicidal
to your own interests.</p>

<p>"The ejectment of the inhabitants from the
depopulated districts will give you the measure
of its mischievous results. The rents its population

<!-- vol 3 page 344 -->

paid you, I am aware, were paid in
monies doubly due. I am aware that the
lands which no one can buy of you being at
any rate unsaleable have the same value tenanted
or untenanted, but still the people occupying
it were incessantly creating fresh
wealth!"</p>

<p>"Stay," replied Eustatius, "you have forgotten
one thing in your economical estimate
which I remember. If there were anything
left for me to acquire, gold to accumulate, or
land to purchase that conversion of the earth's
produce into other forms through the intermedium
of man's labour, which you designate
the creation of property might serve as a
means of procuring whatever wealth I was not
yet possessed of. But there is not. Where
is the land that does not or will not own me as
its Lord? Where is the wealth that is not or
will not inevitably be mine? The rich
man values his securities because convertible

<!-- vol 3 page 345 -->

into gold, the gold into corn or labour, but
without ever intending to turn them into
either.</p>

<p>"For me it is enough to know that the earth
can feed and breed men, and that men can
create wealth on its surface. That capability
constitutes its value in my eyes. I have
no motive for testing it, particularly to the
benefit and advantage of mankind&mdash;who, I
think, you will admit, owe me, in the aggregate,
no good will.</p>

<p>"The districts I have depopulated no longer
require armed force or superintendence; they
are no longer dangerous; they no longer disquiet
me. There may be risk in depopulating,
but I am satisfied less peril than in allowing
men to multiply&mdash;less, whilst one individual
armed can coerce a hundred,&mdash;whilst armed
men can be hired as drovers of their kind, and
then decimated and redecimated in their turn
by the potency of gold.</p>

<p>"Great change is naturally the work of time,

<!-- vol 3 page 346 -->

which may fail us completely to accomplish it;
but this, mark me, is the ideal of my policy.
That the world is my own, and man a trespasser
on its surface!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

<p class="small">MYRRAH AND TEMPEST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of day is hushed, the denizens of
night not yet awakened. It is the hour
when the weary sun sinks down, when the bee
is in its hive, the bird upon its bough; when
the moon has not yet risen, when the stars
are not yet twinkling&mdash;the hour which poets
choose for meditation&mdash;the hour when lovers
give language to their love.</p>

<p>No Paphian bower, of which the spontaneous
flowers sprang up beneath Cytherea's

<!-- vol 3 page 348 -->

tread, ever afforded scene more meet for
love's impassioned utterance or silent ecstasy,
than the sweet spot, by that fountain's side,
whose silvery spray is still warm with the last
roseate hues that linger in the twilight&mdash;where
the moss is so soft and green&mdash;where
rose, jessamine, and woodbine wreathe into
one, and blend their odours&mdash;where the flowers
seem to distil double honey&mdash;to emit a
two-fold fragrance&mdash;where innumerable birds
attune their song by day&mdash;where the glowworm
sparkles in the violets, and the nightingale
pours out its wild melody through the
live-long night.</p>

<p>Here Tempest slumbers. Here Myrrah
watches him, smoothing those locks which the
voluptuous breath of evening disarrays and
scatters on his cheek.</p>

<p>Victim of her own wiles&mdash;ensnared in her
own spell&mdash;she loves, unfortunate!</p>

<p>That blissful contemplation in which she
indulges now is chequered by the disquieting

<!-- vol 3 page 349 -->

consciousness of what she is, and what he
deems her.</p>

<p>Whilst her eyes are humid with emotion&mdash;which
seems happiness&mdash;look at the motion of
that hand, tremulous with the apprehension
which haunts her dreams, which disturbs her
mid-day reverie!</p>

<p>He will awaken soon, to greet her passionate
glances with looks of tenderness, to
breathe endearing words into her ear, to press
her lips with his warm kisses; but yet she
knows that death and poison lurk amongst the
flowers&mdash;the death of her fond hopes&mdash;the
poison of a word&mdash;distracting thought!&mdash;that
poison would be the name of Myrrah breathed
into his ear!</p>

<p>She starts. Do you see that gigantic figure
in the dim twilight beckoning her imperiously
away? With a shudder&mdash;a blush of shame&mdash;a
look of loathing&mdash;letting gently down upon
a cushion Tempest's head, she rises to obey
that hated summons.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 350 -->

<p>"Softly!" said Invective Rabid, "he must
not be disturbed till we have conversed
together."</p>

<p>"Speak then," replied Myrrah, "he may
awaken every instant, and he might suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suspect!" said Invective raising his voice
purposely to a louder pitch. "How should
he suspect, who, for three months long has
believed in the innocent simplicity of Myrrah?"</p>

<p>"Hush! in pity's name hush!" said Myrrah
with such an agonising look&mdash;in such a
tone of imploration that Invective ceased his
cruel pleasantry.</p>

<p>"Fear not. Though undertaking to lead
this youth astray by your syren wiles, through
devotion to my fortunes, and then capriciously
transferring your affection to his person&mdash;believe
me&mdash;in complacent consciousness of my
superior inaccessibility to your influence, I have
found compensation for his conquest. If you

<!-- vol 3 page 351 -->

have neglected this time to play the Delilah&mdash;you
are&mdash;you must continue&mdash;the true Armida
of our Rinaldo. He has forgotten name,
fame, and party in your arms. One effort
more and I am satisfied."</p>

<p>"What?" gasped Myrrah. "What treachery
do you seek to urge upon me now? I laid
you bare the history of my life, the secrets of
my soul&mdash;I showed you how, sated with admiration,
the wish to love which buds in girlhood's
spring, only marked my woman's
summer.</p>

<p>"I did not deceive you; you were the object
of its vague desire,&mdash;the hero of the
imagination you had dazzled, masked in another
mind&mdash;till my enthusiasm&mdash;turned from its false
worship&mdash;found its god, and my heart, for the
first time, its mate!</p>

<p>"I have thrown myself on your generosity.
I have implored your mercy. You
know that I love him better than my life,
that I would yield it up, that I would scatter

<!-- vol 3 page 352 -->

my happiness to the winds, that I would fling
my soul into the abyss, that I would even <i>part</i>
sooner than that injury should come to him
through me&mdash;but you know that I cannot bear
the thought of his lost love, and thus you have
urged me to betray him&mdash;thus you have infused
treachery into each caress&mdash;remorse into every
hour of love, thus you have made each blandishment
a snare, these arms the toils in which
that fame, which to him is life, was ignominiously
perishing! Tempt me no more&mdash;seek
not in me an accomplice further!"</p>

<p>"All that you say, Myrrah, you have done.
The masses, deserted by their idol, have fallen
back on their old chief. Lulled into false security,
persuaded into disgust, Tempest waits in
retirement, till the times are rife for action. He
slumbers on the battle's eve&mdash;the multitude
has risen against the one, and I, not he, must
lead it to the conquest. Still&mdash;at the eleventh
hour&mdash;when face to face with the peril, the
cravens, who have gloried in his absence, clamour

<!-- vol 3 page 353 -->

for his countenance&mdash;they may strive to
summon him&mdash;vague rumours may rouse his
suspicion, if he stirs abroad. It is your part,
Myrrah, now to watch over, to detain him&mdash;to
shield your minion from the danger&mdash;to prolong
his slumbers, and not to let him waken
till the world is lost or redeemed without his
aid!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Myrrah, "that he may
rise to curse me! No, lost as I am, never!
never!"</p>

<p>"To curse," repeated Invective, ironically,
"men reserve curses to express their hate, not
as the language of contempt. Shall I arouse
him now and brand the courtesan?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no! no!" said Myrrah, in a voice inarticulate,
with anguish, as she grasped Invective's
arm convulsively.</p>

<p class="center">* * * *</p>

<p>The moon has risen, and by its light Tempest

<!-- vol 3 page 354 -->

looks into Myrrah's eyes where the tears
have gathered.</p>

<p>"Why should you, dearest, dwell on such a
painful theme? What pity can restore its
whiteness to the tainted snow&mdash;its delicacy to
the trampled lily? How would you answer
your own question?"</p>

<p>"I perhaps," said Myrrah, "I should recall
the words of some one who has said or sung,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p>"The unblemished dew, bright, round, and clear,<br/>

Whose rays the sight allure,<br/>

When glittering like an angel's tear,<br/>

It shines from leaf or bough,<br/>

Is Woman innocent and pure.<br/>

That dew-drop mingled with the dust,<br/>

And trampled in the slough,<br/>

Blent with defilement in disgust,&mdash;<br/>

Is woman after the sad fall,<br/>

No human art can more recall.</p>

<p>Yet from that reeking mire,<br/>

The sun's warm beams give birth,<br/>

To exhalations which aspire,<br/>

And pristine purity restore,<br/>

To the foul slime of earth,<br/>

Making&mdash;like love grown out of lust,&mdash;<br/>
The dampness of that humid dust,<br/>
The heavenly dew it was before.</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<!-- vol 3 page 355 -->

<p>"But look," said Tempest, "what is that?
Do you see those fires on the horizon? Do
you hear those sounds like the booming of
distant guns!"</p>

<p>"What should they be?" answered Myrrah,
whose pallor was not discernible in the
moonlight, "what but the bonfires and the
idle rejoicings of some holiday?"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 356 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE LAST SCENE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the maladies of free states are chronic, the
convulsions of despotism are usually sudden.
The masses have arisen from their long slumber.
Tens of thousands are in arms. The government,
though not able to prevent the insurrection,
is strong enough to quell it. The
insurgents are put down in detail, excepting
the main body, who had taken possession of
the capital, from which defeat has expelled

<!-- vol 3 page 357 -->

them. They were desperate men, and they
have fought hard&mdash;so hard, that they have
gained breathing time, as they pursue, almost
without a hope, their retreat through the devastated
country.</p>

<p>With a kind of order in their disarray, they
troop through deserted villages and ruined
towns, their number thinned on the one hand
by the chances of the road, and on the other,
recruited from the misery of the localities
they traverse.</p>

<p>They are a gaunt multitude, still imposing
from their numbers, but whose masses, long
privation has enfeebled&mdash;whom hunger decimates
now, whom small hope cheers in their
onward progress&mdash;and upon whose rear the foe
hangs threatening.</p>

<p>The skies are dark and lowering. Heavy
clouds mark the horizon, and when a halt is
made the bray of the enemy's trumpet sounds
in the distance, and the gleam of arms flashes

<!-- vol 3 page 358 -->

further than the van of the pursuing host can
be discerned.</p>

<p>In the despot's forces there may not be one
willing heart, but there are eager heads and
hands. The soldiers of the state are well fed
and paid, and consequently faithful&mdash;fling man
his bone, and when is he not ready to play
the sleuth-hound or the sheep-dog? Their arms
and equipments are complete, the soldiers
fresh, the leaders confident.</p>

<p>On the popular side the motley assembly
of their chiefs exhibit profound dejection. The
representatives of extinct parties figure in that
melancholy procession. The once exclusive
oligarch&mdash;the ruined senator&mdash;the formal moderate,
mingle despondently with the disheartened
demagogue. There is only Invective Rabid,
who, with brow erect, and threatening eye,
and boastful speech, still cheers his followers,
and sometimes instills into their breasts an
evanescent hope, by his undaunted bearing.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 359 -->

<p>He has come to a halt upon an eminence
with his host. He is no soldier, but he has a
soldier's eye, and he questions closely two
advisers of military experience by his side.</p>

<p>The enemy's van is in sight. Ten thousand
glittering horsemen whom their brilliant leader
deploys at the base of the hill to strike terror
into that crowd whom he dares not attack
unsupported. What is to be done? the multitude
require repose; but if it rests here to-night,
how on the morrow cross the wide plain
behind it to the undulating ground beyond, in
the face of that daring cavalry? There is but
one expedient, which Invective adopts, sure to
be disastrous with such motley forces, that of
encamping and silently resuming his march at
midnight. But if they can reach the passes, a
stand may yet be made, and they may possibly
recruit their strength from the districts beyond.</p>

<p>Of all the evils that follow in the train of a
dispirited host there is but one that Invective

<!-- vol 3 page 360 -->

does not dread&mdash;desertion; because it is known
that the pursuing army makes no prisoners.</p>

<p>"Why, in fact," says Eustatius, "should
food, denied the pauper, be wasted on the criminal
or the rebel?"</p>

<p>The morning dawns. The night and the
enemy have done their work conjointly. Slain,
scattered, broken, wildly flying, the popular
masses strew that boundless plain.</p>

<p>Pharoah's army, when the Red Sea's waves
engulfed it, the fugitive myriads of the Persian
King, Napoleon's army retreating across
the Beresina, can alone convey some faint
image of the uproar and devastation of that
scene.</p>

<p>One little band seems alone to have crossed
the fatal level. Emerging&mdash;like the survivors
of a shipwrecked crew from the overwhelming
flood&mdash;they pause upon the hill-side, and
overlook, with stupefaction and dismay, the
destruction from which they have been thus
far rescued, but whose rising tide threatens

<!-- vol 3 page 361 -->

to suck them back into the remorseless
deep.</p>

<p>Invective Rabid still heads this fragment of
a people's strength. He is now without hope
or fear, as he glances over the scene before him
with a sullen and savage curiosity.</p>

<p>The pale, bespattered, and blood-stained
companions who dejectedly surround him&mdash;though
the last in arms&mdash;are not even the
bravest of the embattled thousands who yesterday
obeyed his bidding. The bravest lie
cold and mangled upon yonder plain; and
therefore, in the group gathered about him,
the men of words&mdash;orators, oligarchical and
democratic&mdash;predominate over men of action.
They are there, not because they have hewn
their way through the perils of that night but
because they have followed with confidence,
him who did so.</p>

<p>Their glances wander alternately from the
face of their leader&mdash;who disregards them with

<!-- vol 3 page 362 -->

a brutal contempt&mdash;to the field before them&mdash;where,
by slow degrees, the dark masses of
the pursuing army advance with fearful regularity
to hem in their position.</p>

<p>As the bristling columns move in their certain
progression, like the finger on a dial&mdash;never
retarded or receding&mdash;isolated horsemen
scour the plain, and careering squadrons advance
and then retire. Now, in a glittering mass, they
sweep dangerously close to the base of that
hill of refuge, whose rugged flank is inaccessible
to horsemen, and then come to a sudden
halt.</p>

<p>Their brilliant leader addresses them; an
audible murmur rises from their line&mdash;a wavering
of its ranks indicates some hesitation&mdash;and
then, its chief&mdash;distinguishable by his white
steed and waving plume&mdash;accompanied by a few
followers, spurs straight upon the rebel entrenchments.</p>

<p>He is pursued&mdash;his companions are cut

<!-- vol 3 page 363 -->

down&mdash;and thanks only to his charger's speed&mdash;breathless
and disarrayed&mdash;alone&mdash;a fugitive
he gains the popular line.</p>

<p>It is Julian. His tale is soon told. Unemployed,
in penury, he was sought out in this
sudden necessity of the state, to be placed
high in the command of its armies.</p>

<p>They all know, he says, how he has borne
himself in the field. Little heed had he of the
right in that or any other strife, but he had
no heart for unresisted slaughter&mdash;he has let
escape many of his prisoners&mdash;amongst
whom, some of consequence. This dereliction
of duty, he has just learned, has reached the
despot's ear&mdash;it would have been sternly
visited on his head; and, therefore, he has
chosen rather to come where he may die with
a sword in his hand, than trust to the mercies
of his implacable master. The faint hope
which this accession to the popular ranks had
inspired, gives place to profound discouragement.
It is not the only accession. Having

<!-- vol 3 page 364 -->

been a few hours stationary, troops of children,
women, and fugitives, come pouring in, snatching,
like drowning wretches, at the last plank.
Grown selfish and cruel in their extremity,
the companions of Invective propose that no
more shall be admitted within their line&mdash;that
group is about to be turned mercilessly
away when the sentinels fall back, and a murmur
of surprise passes from lip to lip&mdash;Tempest&mdash;their
long lost leader&mdash;is amongst
them!</p>

<p>Yesterday that announcement would still
have electrified them with hope&mdash;yesterday
it might still have moved Invective's jealousy.
Now there is no more room for hope or
jealousy. The crowd make way apathetically,
and Invective stepping forward grasps his
hand&mdash;a tear glistens on his rough eyelid and
he says with emotion,</p>

<p>"You are come to die amongst us! but you
cannot forgive us?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Tempest, "I have come to lead

<!-- vol 3 page 365 -->

you to the victory you would have stolen
without me. Listen. I have learned as we
came along that there is consternation in the
enemy's camp. The Tyrant himself is missing.
In two hours more that host will disband
like a mass without coherence."</p>

<p>"In two hours more," said Invective, "we
shall lie stark and cold. Do you see that
bristling wall closing in upon us? those squadrons
that will trample us&mdash;those batteries
preparing to mow us down beneath their iron
shower. They will listen to no parley; they
shoot down our flag of truce; as well reason
with the wild waves!"</p>

<p>"Then," replied Tempest, "be we the
rock on which those breakers shiver. Have
you faith in me? Will you obey me?"</p>

<p>"Now and ever more," said Invective Rabid.
"Through life&mdash;till death&mdash;come when
it may!"</p>

<p>And the accent of his enthusiastic conviction

<!-- vol 3 page 366 -->

touched a corresponding fibre in every
bosom.</p>

<p class="center">* * * *</p>

<p>Invective Rabid, detached in advance with
a small band, occupies a position beyond the
protection of the broken ground. Tempest
is stationed on the hill crest. For the first
time he has resolved to concentrate those
powers derived from knowledge of nature's
secrets to a purpose destructive&mdash;even though
destructive to preserve. The mysterious appliances
are prepared, the crowd looks on with
the same wonder as the Syracusans on the contrivances
of Archimedes to defend their threatened
walls. There are men of science there, who
could at other times have proved to you the
futility of his pretensions, only that just now&mdash;with
a merciless foe in front&mdash;they cling to
any hope like a dying man to the promises of
an empiric.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 367 -->

<p>The masses of the enemy who had halted
within cannon shot, are now in decisive
motion.</p>

<p>A movement to the right isolates Invective
Rabid. Cut off&mdash;surrounded&mdash;his position is
like an island in a hostile sea.</p>

<p>The time is come to discharge the destroying
fluids over whose subtle nature Tempest
holds mastery. The words of warning are
spoken&mdash;the signal is given. The electrical
flame flashes from the operator's hand&mdash;it
bounds&mdash;it crackles&mdash;it plays amongst the
lurid clouds, and then dies away innocuously
on the horizon. The schemer's art has
failed!</p>

<p>Invective and his band&mdash;lost, surrounded,
overwhelmed&mdash;disappear the next moment in
the wild rush which accompanies the shout by
which the foe responds to Tempest's harmless
demonstration.</p>

<p>At this sight no longer doubt but despair
seizes his followers. With a curse&mdash;on his head&mdash;on

<!-- vol 3 page 368 -->

their own credulity&mdash;they fly, and with a
roar of triumph, prolonged and deafening, the
mighty masses of the victorious host sweep
onward to engulf the last relic of resistance.</p>

<p>Alone, undaunted, Tempest remains to make
a final effort. The destroying fluid hurtles
and hisses from his hand; flash succeeds
flash: at length the true direction is gained;
it speeds away in full projectile energy!
The effect is magical. A wild dismay
seizes upon that host. It dissolves like
a snow flake in the furnace. Its marshalled
ranks scatter and divide&mdash;the affrighted
steeds&mdash;bursting all bonds trample down the
yelling infantry, or drag the limbered guns at
a fatal gallop, crushing and mangling as they
speed. The prostrate rider groans beneath
the steed's hoof&mdash;the leaders are stretched upon
the field, or borne away in their chargers' mad
career. The soldiers&mdash;tearing off their equipments
and their clothes,&mdash;overturn each other
as they attempt to fly.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 369 -->

<p>In a few seconds that admirably organised
force has ceased to be. That army, is a panic-stricken
mob.</p>

<p>Everything metallic in its equipment or arms
is molten. The iron of the firelock has poured
in hot streams from the charred stock&mdash;the steel
of the blade on to the hand that grasped it&mdash;the
cuirass on the rider's body&mdash;the helm on his
scorched brain&mdash;the bit in the jaws of the maddened
steed&mdash;have all eaten in like living fire!</p>

<p>"Now!" said Tempest, "follow me, but no
bloodshed. Remember that we are armed
against unarmed men."</p>

<p>One of the first obstacles which Tempest
encounters, as he leads the way through
the mangled corpses of his detachment, and
the confusion of shattered defences and cannon
overturned&mdash;is a body still breathing, though
irrecognisable, but for its gigantic proportions,
amidst the defilement of mud and gore.</p>

<p>He attempts to step aside, but the eyes of
the dying Invective open, and raising his

<!-- vol 3 page 370 -->

brawny hand to his Herculean chest; he utters
through the crimson foam frothing on his
lips:</p>

<p>"Turn not aside! Stop not here&mdash;pass on to
victory!&mdash;be this the expiation&mdash;"</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>Thus far the field is won. The affrighted
soldiery embrace the popular cause by thousands;
the news arrives that Eustatius himself
has been made prisoner. Returned from pursuit,
the victors at mid-day are gathered round
their leader. Children, fugitives, and warriors
are there&mdash;all, who have not perished in the
untoward mischance which marked so inauspiciously
the opening of that day&mdash;yet the eyes
of Tempest wander wistfully in search of
something absent.</p>

<p>At length a litter&mdash;in which a female
figure reclines, and which another accompanies,&mdash;is

<!-- vol 3 page 371 -->

borne along, and set down almost in the
middle of the crowd.</p>

<p>The Lady Calliro&euml;,&mdash;to whom all honour!&mdash;walks
beside that bier. It is she whom Julian
clandestinely liberated. It is she, by whose
persuasion Tempest came to the people's succour;
it is she to whose innocence&mdash;falsely
condemned&mdash;the first act of the people will be
a glaring tribute!</p>

<p>But who is that she tends so kindly!
One who, in the wanderings of delirium, tears
aside the veil which covers her and extends her
arms at the sound of Tempest's voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"What Myrrah!" exclaim the bystanders
with one accord.</p>

<p>"Myrrah!" repeated the Lady Calliro&euml;, with
a start of horror as if told of some unclean
thing in contact with her person.</p>

<p>An expression of disgust and pain breaks
from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Stay," said Lord Besom, who had just
been explaining to a knot of listeners the

<!-- vol 3 page 372 -->

rationale of the power employed by Tempest,
"stay,&mdash;just now&mdash;a leader&mdash;the saviour of a
people,&mdash;it is bad taste to commit yourself in
public with such a personage as Myrrah."</p>

<p>"Myrrah!" said Tempest stupefied. "The
actress,&mdash;the notorious?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The notorious courtesan," added Lord
Besom, "surely you have found out who she
is by this time!"</p>

<p>"Speak!" said Tempest, appealing to Myrrah,
as if so monstrous an assertion were incredible
from any other lips.</p>

<p>Myrrah could only conceal her face. But
when&mdash;with a glance of scorn&mdash;Tempest strode
away, overcoming her shame, she raised
herself upon the brancard and uttered so
piteous a cry that the Lady Calliro&euml; hastened
to her aid, and then Tempest's heart&mdash;crushed
and sickened as it was&mdash;was touched with
compassion.</p>

<p>"Death is in her face!" said the Lady Calliro&euml;,
beckoning them to bear her out of the

<!-- vol 3 page 373 -->

crowd, and as Tempest turned his eyes upon
Myrrah, the traces of so fatal an alteration
were visible on her features, that he followed
into the dwelling in which the bier was
deposited.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tempest!" said Myrrah, "unworthy
as I may be, turn not thus away from me&mdash;at
least till you know all! I am indeed Myrrah&mdash;the
notorious Myrrah. I have deceived
you&mdash;I have sinned against your fame; but
if the most fearful sacrifice ever made by
woman be any atonement, that atonement I
have made. I knew that to let you learn my
name was to change love into obloquy, passion
into loathing. Yet she will tell you how
deliberately I have done so&mdash;and if she will
not speak, death will soon speak for me.</p>

<p>"It was such bliss to live and to be loved, yet
I resolved to die rather than peril your glory&mdash;to
expire with a blessing from your lips,
rather than live and love betraying you&mdash;but
this humiliation I had hoped would have
been spared me&mdash;only that it seems as if life

<!-- vol 3 page 374 -->

<i>would</i> linger where you are&mdash;for I am poisoned,
Tempest and ready to die happy in
the rapturous memory of my love&mdash;so that
you do not loathe me now&mdash;so that you dismiss
my soul with a word of kindness."</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," whispered Lord Besom,
"you really are more impressionable than discerning&mdash;you
forget that that woman is the
first actress we have&mdash;that she is, perhaps, performing
now."</p>

<p>"No," said Tempest, gloomily, "she is
dead!"</p>

<p>Lord Besom was silenced.</p>

<p class="center">* * * *</p>

<p>Eustatius is, indeed, a captive. He fled from
his camp, but his flight was in nowise occasioned

<!-- vol 3 page 375 -->

by the events which have been recorded. On
the eve of that eventful day, whilst his arms
were triumphant, he had mysteriously vanished
from his tent. He is, at length, discovered by
those who scour the field, sitting with his feet
in the water by the pool-side. When spoken
to, he only answers with the inane smile of
idiotcy. His intellect is gone for ever.</p>

<p>Is it the aberration which drove Nebuchadnezzar
to eat grass with the beasts of the field;
the idiotcy that stamped the House of Hapsburg,
the insanity of the Romanoffs&mdash;that
curse which is so often to despotism, what despotism
is to the human race?</p>

<p>No&mdash;Tempest discerns amidst the symptoms
of approaching dissolution in that captive,
whom he regards rather as a patient than
an enemy, the signs of a new and unexpected
calamity to mankind.</p>

<p>The institutions hostile to man's progress,
are now levelled with the dust&mdash;no force or
fraud will interfere now with ameliorations

<!-- vol 3 page 376 -->

founded on the accumulating experience of the
past&mdash;the plague once threatening his physical
existence, has ceased to be; but though famine
and pestilence have been subdued, and
though it seemed as if nothing could ever
more cloud the destiny of the human kind with
barbarism and woe&mdash;yet lo! even in that hour of
self-gratulation, the galvanist's creation&mdash;the
insect&mdash;baffled but not destroyed, re-appears in a
form more terrible. Driven from the organic forms
of plants and animals, its haunt is now in the
human brain. Into that brain which philosophy
has deemed secretive of thought&mdash;the
plague which is thought's progeny penetrates.
Eustatius is its first victim. Whether the last,
or whether one link in an extended chain embracing
all humanity, is the momentous problem
which, in the midst of triumph, fills
Tempest's mind with dread and anguish, suggesting
the humiliating apprehension, that,
though the power of thought, accumulated by
intercommunication, must inevitably rise in

<!-- vol 3 page 377 -->

an ascending scale, further than thought can
limit,&mdash;that it is still liable, from association
with matter, to those maladies which have
prostrated, enfeebled, or swept off from the
earth whole species of its organic creations!</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>In that disheartening doubt&mdash;proceeding to
reform, re-model, and re-construct&mdash;we leave
him between hope and fear, with tender memories
of the dead, and gentle thoughts&mdash;not unreciprocated&mdash;towards
one living.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

<p class="small">CONCLUSION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the old galvanist, John Cash, Invective
Rabid, and Myrrah, we have seen the fate.
Eustatius did not long linger after them.</p>

<p>Of others who have figured in this tale, little
remains to be recorded.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper and Middleman Cautious, expelled
from public life, have retired into privacy,
and meet nightly to renew upon the

<!-- vol 3 page 379 -->

chess-board the ingenuity of their political
combinations.</p>

<p>To the Lady Floranthe we had almost forgotten
to relate that Eustatius, subsequently
to his wife's condemnation and after his coolness
with the Lady Sabina, had repaired with
a matrimonial proposition, accepted before he
specified that it was&mdash;not for the mother's&mdash;but
for the daughter's hand!</p>

<p>Nevertheless to secure such an alliance in
the family was a success&mdash;a success not destined
to be realised. The neglected daughter
had ruined her mother's plan by a clandestine
marriage with Tempest's companion of the
Tuilleries&mdash;the Count of Paris. The Lady
Floranthe lived on for sometime in her widowhood,
but at length was induced to bestow her
hand upon James Cash, the last scion of his
house and consequent inheritor of his aunt's
still vast fortune.</p>

<p>Grubout Florid continued his biographical
pursuits until his death. The last work on

<!-- vol 3 page 380 -->

which he was engaged was a republication, with
commentaries and notes, of the "Age of Pitt
and Fox," but his rival Niebuhr St. Thomas
almost immediately proved that the work in
question was a fiction in the prevalent taste
of that day, after the fashion of the "Sixty
Years Hence," and that both Pitt and Fox were
clearly allegories&mdash;relating rather to fable than
to history.</p>

<p>"The deep pitt getting the better of the fox&mdash;the
pitt into which the fox tumbled&mdash;a revival
of the snake and the file.&mdash;Pshaw! what could
be more obvious?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Cash, who had been confined by Eustatius,
like Josephine at Malmaison, and who
lived in the belief that her husband had caught
his death from damp feet, and Eustatius his
fatal malady from neglecting the use of a
comforter, long wore her mourning and her
widow's weeds, but not for ever.</p>

<p>Her mansion, its princely grounds, its "<i>turpentine</i>
walks, and <i>revenues</i> of trees," as she

<!-- vol 3 page 380 -->

expressed it, felt lonely to her, and she took
unto herself another Lord.</p>

<p>John Cash, her lamented first, she said emphatically
was "<i>a man</i>," she did not hope to
meet his like again, and therefore as a "<i>pease
alley</i>" (<i>pis-aller</i>) determined to select for mate
at least a gentleman.</p>

<p>Her second is not unknown to the reader&mdash;less
proud of his lady than his lady of him,
he has grown bashful, or we might bid him
stand forward and shake hands with the once
gay Julian whom her fortune has tempted.</p>
