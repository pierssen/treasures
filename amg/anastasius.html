<p>TO you, my <span class="smcap">Louisa</span>; to you, the sole
partner of all my joys and sorrows; to
you whose fair form but enshrines a mind
far fairer, I inscribe <i>not</i> these pages. Composed
of materials collected ere I knew
you, ere I was inspired by your virtues
or could portray your perfections, they
are not worthy of bearing your name:&mdash;they
were not even intended to divulge
that of the writer, had his secret been preserved
as inviolate as he wished. Should
they, thus avowed, continue to meet with
an indulgent reception, I may then feel
encouraged at some future period to publish,
with the sanction of your beloved
name, that which, suggested by the contemplation
of your excellence, and written

<!-- vol 1 page vi -->

under the guidance of your unerring taste,
is in truth your own work.</p>

<p>To the public at large I can only plead,
for sending forth into the world this unpruned
performance, the desire of imparting
a few perhaps unimportant notices,&mdash;but
the result of personal observation,&mdash;with
respect to the ever interesting regions,
once adorned by the Greeks and now
defaced by the Turks. I shall therefore
observe that the historical and statistical
parts are (as far as my knowledge extends)
strictly correct, and that the fictitious
superstructure is as conformable as
I could make it to the manners of the
nations whom it was my aim to describe;
and as the form of biographical memoirs
was adopted solely with the view of affording
greater facility for the introduction of
minute and characteristic details, I trust

<!-- vol 1 page vii -->

that I shall not be considered as identifying
myself with all the opinions which the
peculiar nature of the work has obliged
me to bestow upon my hero.</p>

<h2>MEMOIRS OF A GREEK.</h2>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>MY family came originally from Epirus: my
father settled at Chios. His parentage was neither
exalted nor yet low. In his own opinion he could
boast of purer blood than any of the Pal&aelig;ologi, the
Cantacusenes, and the Comneni of the present day.
"These mongrel descendants," he used to observe,
"of Greeks, Venetians, and Genoese, had only
picked up the fine names of former ages when the
real owners dropped off: he wore his own;" and
signor Sotiri saw no reason why he should not,
when he went forth into public, toss his head, swing
his jubbee<sup id="r001"><a href="#n001">1</a></sup> like a pendulum from side to side, and
shuffle along in his papooshes, with all the airs of
quality.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

<p>This worthy man combined in his single person
the various characters of diplomatist, husbandman,
merchant, manufacturer, and master of a privateer.
To be more explicit&mdash;he was drogueman<sup id="r002"><a href="#n002">2</a></sup> to the
French consul at Chios; in town he kept a silk-loom
at work; in the country he had a plantation
of <i>agrumi;</i><sup id="r003"><a href="#n003">3</a></sup> he exported his stuffs and fruits to the
principal sea-ports in the Archipelago, and, in the
first Russian war, he employed all his spare money
in fitting out a small vessel to cruise against the
enemy,&mdash;for so he chose to consider the Russians,
in spite of all their amicable professions towards the
Greeks. As a loyal subject of the Porte, and an
old servant of the French government, he felt no
sort of wish to be delivered from the yoke of the
Turks; and he looked upon those barbarians of
the north, who cared no more for the patriarch of
Constantinople than for the pope of Rome, as little
better than rank heretics, not worthy of being
treated even like his silk-worms, which he got
every year carefully exorcised before their spinning
time. I however remember, when a child, some
buzz in the family about my father's partner in
the privateer&mdash;an Ispariote re&iuml;s<sup id="r004"><a href="#n004">4</a></sup>&mdash;having one day
made a mistake, in capturing under the rocks of
Jura a rich Turkish vessel, which he went and sold
to the Russians themselves, then stationed at Paros.
Signor Sotiri shook his head at this intelligence as
if he did not approve of the transaction, and observed,

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

"the less that was said about it, the better."&mdash;I
suppose therefore it was out of sheer humanity
that he preferred receiving his share of the prize
money, to the sterile and barbarous satisfaction of
hanging his associate.</p>

<p>Much improved in his circumstances by this untoward
accident, my father would now willingly
have given up his interpretership. Besides rendering
him more or less dependent, it was uncomfortable
in as far as, being very deaf, he never heard
what it was his business to repeat. But my mother
liked the title of droguemaness. She had never
heard of the necessity of a drogueman reporting
speeches as he received them; and she reminded her
husband how essential the protection of the French
mission might be to some of his Greek speculations.</p>

<p>My mother was a native of Naxos, and esteemed
a great heiress in her country. She possessed an
estate of three hundred piastres a year, clear, managed
by a relation of her own, Marco Politi&mdash;very
wealthy himself, primate of all the Greek villages
of the island, and a very great rogue.</p>

<p>My brothers and sisters,&mdash;and there came, one
by one, just three of each,&mdash;all contrived to take
precedence of me at their birth, and consequently
throughout the whole of their subsequent lives.
The punctilio of the thing I should not have minded;
but, among my countrymen, a foolish family pride
exhausts people's fortunes in their lifetime in portioning

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

their daughters: the elder sons ran away
with what remained, and poor Anastasius brought
up the rear with but an indifferent prospect. My
kind parents, however, determined to make up for
leaving me destitute at their death, by spoiling me
as much as possible during their lives.</p>

<p>My eldest sister (I begin, as is proper, with the
ladies) married a physician of the country, graduated
at Padua. Robust as a hamal,<sup id="r005"><a href="#n005">5</a></sup> and never
till her marriage having known a moment's illness,
Epiphania seemed to bid defiance to her husband's
utmost skill in medicine. But she was not proof
against her own imaginations. Signor Sozimo expressed
such constant anxiety about his "dear
wife's" precious health, and gave her so much viper
broth to keep up her strength, that she soon began
to fancy herself in a bad way, and died at last of
the mere apprehension of not living.</p>

<p>My sister Roxana, who would have been a
beauty, but for a scar which she chose to call a
dimple, at an early age fell desperately in love with
a Turk; and, spite of all the remonstrances of her
friends, bestowed her hand upon this unbeliever.
Nor was it until the very last of her offended relations
had been prevailed upon to grant her an unlimited
pardon, that she became conscious of the
heinousness of her crime, and began to feel an unconquerable
desire to re-enter the pale of our holy
communion. This she at length effected, by never

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

ceasing to bewail her apostacy, till her husband, in
disgust, allowed her a divorce. Immediately she
flew back at once into the arms of the church and
into those of a young Greek, who, an effective instrument
in her reformation, obliterated every trace
of her first unhallowed wedlock by a more canonical
union. He truly laboured for the church;
for he was by trade an agio-graphis, or painter of
Saints; and connoisseurs esteemed him the Apelles
of our district, in that line. His spouse sat for all
his Virgins, and, accordingly as she behaved well
or ill, he used to paint them handsome or ugly; a
practice which kept her very much upon her good
behaviour. She was conceited about her looks, and
wasted as much paint upon her cheeks as her husband
did upon his canvas; a circumstance, however,
which produced a striking resemblance between
the copies and the original.</p>

<p>As to my youngest sister, she deemed a two
years obedience, well or ill performed, to a single
lord and master, quite trial enough for a woman in
this nether world. Her husband dying, she took
the habit of a caloyera,<sup id="r006"><a href="#n006">6</a></sup> in a nunnery near the delightful
district of the Lentiscs. There, the interest
of her portion, together with the produce of her
handiwork, enabled her to set up, according to
the practice of our religious communities, an independent
establishment, and to entertain her friends

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

of both sexes in a manner at once comfortable and
decorous.</p>

<p>What shall I say of my brothers? The eldest
was a loose and dissipated youth. To cure him of
his extravagance, my father had him nailed to the
desk of the strictest merchant in Smyrna. The
consequence was that, instead of the clerk staying
at home, desk, contents, and all, followed him out
of doors, till, in a notorious tavern, the well tempered
Brescia blade of a Zantiote captain put an
end to his prowess, and saved him the mortification
of being returned on our hands as a hopeless
profligate. Of all the family I felt the most grieved
for his loss. He had a dark complexion and a fine
commanding figure. I looked upon Theodore with
a certain veneration, as the prop of the house; and
had purposed some day to take him for my model.</p>

<p>The dove is not more distinguished from the
game-cock, than differed from the noisy blustering
Theodore the sly, demure Eustathius, destined to
succeed my father in his place of drogueman. A
sleek, smooth-spoken, sanctified lad, with a round
face and a red and white complexion, Eustathius,
beside that little treasure his own dear self, which
he always kept with the utmost care, valued but
one other thing in this world&mdash;namely, money. Of
this article his good fortune, or rather, his unabating
perseverance, enabled him at last to wed a prodigious

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

heap; encumbered, however, with a wary
widow its mistress, who, after four distinct refusals,
finally condescended to accept my brother as her
slave, under the name of her husband. But the
chains worn by this admirer of solid worth were of
gold; and all he wanted was the pleasure of contemplating
their refulgence.</p>

<p>Constantine, my third brother, managed the farm.
This hopeful youth, only a few years older than
myself, used to hate me with singular asperity.
I never could understand the cause of this aversion.
He was crooked indeed, and I, unfortunately,
walked straight. If this however could be called
an offence, so many others shared it with me, that
he must have hated nearly the whole human race:&mdash;perhaps
he did. It is true, I much aggravated
my crime by one day observing, on his talking
slightingly of the advantages of a handsome person,
that "they were what no one affected to despise,
who could make good his claim to them;"&mdash;I
thought he would have stabbed me.</p>

<p>After all the rest of the brood had taken wing, I
remained alone at home, to solace my parents. Too
fond of their favourite to damp my youthful spirits
by fitting me for a profession, they kindly put off
from day to day every species of instruction&mdash;probably,
till I should beg for it; which my discretion
forbade. Unfortunately nature chose not, in the
mean time, to be equally dilatory with my parents;

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

and from an angel of an infant, I became by
degrees a great lubberly boy, without any other
accomplishment but that of flogging my top with
the left hand, while with the right I despatched my
sign of the cross&mdash;for in some things I understood
the value of time. My parents, as may be supposed,
were great sticklers for punctuality in every sort of
devout practice; mass-going, confession, lent observance,
&amp;c. Of moral duties&mdash;less tangible in
their nature&mdash;they had, poor souls! but a vague
and confused notion; and the criminality of actions,
in reference to one's neighbour, they taught me
chiefly to estimate according to the greater or smaller
risk connected with them of incurring the bastinado
from the Turks. As to manual correction at the
hands of my own father, it seemed so desirable a
circumstance, from the ample amends my mother
never failed to make her "poor, dear, ill-used boy,"
that my only regret on the subject arose from being
able to obtain it so seldom.</p>

<p>These good people having contented themselves
for a reasonable number of years with wistfully contemplating&mdash;the
drogueman my active make and
well set limbs, and the droguemaness my dark eyes,
ruddy cheeks, and raven locks&mdash;they at last began
to ponder how they might turn these gifts to the
best advantage. Both agreed that something should
be done, but neither knew exactly what; and the
one never proposed a profession, which the other

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

did not immediately object to,&mdash;till an old relation
stepped in between, and recommended the church,
as a never-failing resource to those who can think
of no other. My cousin had set the example by
making his own son a little caloyer at twelve. Prohibited
by the Turks from the trade of a soldier,
and by my parents from that of a sailor, I myself
saw nothing better, and agreed to the proposal. It
now became necessary to give me a smattering of
learning, and I was put under the tuition of a
teacher of the Hellenic language, who assumed the
title of logiotatos, and only averred himself inferior
to Demosthenes, out of sheer modesty. My idleness
got the better of my preceptor's learning and
diligence. All the gold that flowed from the lips of
his favourite St. Chrysostom could not, to my taste,
gild the bitter pill of his own tiresome comments;
and even Homer, much as I liked fighting out of
doors, found but an indifferent welcome in the study.
The truth is, I had a dislike to reading in the abstract:&mdash;but
when away from my books, I affected
a great admiration for Achilles; called him, in reference
to Epirus the land of my ancestors, "my
countryman," and regretted that I was not born two
thousand years ago, for no other purpose but to be
his Patroclus. In my fits of heroism, I swore to
treat the Turks as he had done the Trojans, and for
a time dreamt of nothing but putting to the sword
the whole Seraglio&mdash;dwarfs, eunuchs, and all. These

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

dreams my parents highly admired, but advised me
not to disclose in common. "Just rancour," they
said, "gathers strength by being repressed."&mdash;Upon
this principle they cringed to the ground to every
Moslemin<sup id="r007"><a href="#n007">7</a></sup> they met.</p>

<p>The inclinations of the little future papas<sup id="r008"><a href="#n008">8</a></sup> for
the church militant, began meantime to appear more
prominently. I had collected a troop of ragamuffins
of my own age, of whom I got myself dubbed captain;
and, having purloined from my uncle, the
painter, one of his most smirking Madonnas for a
banner, took the field under the auspices of the
Panagia,<sup id="r009"><a href="#n009">9</a></sup> and set about robbing orchards, and laying
under contribution the villagers, with all the
devotion imaginable. So great was the terror which
our crusades inspired, that the sufferers durst not
even complain, except in a body. Whenever as
chief of the band I became the marked object of
animadversion, I kept out of the way till my father
had paid the damage, and had moreover sued my
pardon for his backwardness in doing so. Once
indeed when, tired of my pranks, he swore I would
be his ruin, I suggested to him an effectual mode of
quieting his fears, by granting me an unlimited leave
of absence; and pledged myself not to return till
doomsday. This was too much for a doting parent.
Sooner than part with his Anastasius, Dimitri Sotiri
would have bribed the peasants beforehand to suffer
all my future depredations.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

<p>Thus early disposed, and trained, to the business
of tithing, my father felt a little surprised when, on
the eve of taking orders, I begged to be excused.
For the first time in his life, signor Sotiri insisted
on implicit obedience; but that first time came too
late. I made it the last, by swearing that if he
forced me to take the mitre,<sup id="r010"><a href="#n010">10</a></sup> I would hide it
under a turban. He yielded, and contented himself
with quietly asking what I finally meant to do.&mdash;"Nothing,"
was the answer of my heart: but the
profession of doing nothing requires ample means.
I therefore pretended a wish to learn trade. My
father assented, and forthwith wrote to a Smyrna
merchant of his acquaintance to receive me into
his counting-house.</p>

<p>Meantime I found an employment for my leisure
hours which put an end to all childish pastimes.
Signor Sotiri, though, as before mentioned, a little
hard of hearing, wanted not fluency of speech. His
oratory had chiefly been exerted to render his patron
dumb. He constantly represented to him how absolutely
the dignity of his station forbade his having
the least conversation with the natives; and how incumbent
upon him it was, though born and bred in
the Levant, to appear not to understand a single
word of its idioms. By this device he kept all
the speechifying to himself; and in truth, with the
Turks in office, at all times more prone than strict
politeness permits to compliment the representatives

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

of Christian powers with the titles of "infidel,
yaoor,<sup id="r011"><a href="#n011">11</a></sup> and Christian dog;" and at this particular
juncture more than usually out of humour, in consequence
of the Russian war,<sup id="r012"><a href="#n012">12</a></sup> this was often the
only way to save the consular pride from some little
rubs, otherwise unavoidable in the necessary intercourse
with the local government. Hence Mr. de
M&mdash;&mdash; not only never stirred from home without
his interpreter by his side, but had him constantly
at his elbow within doors, and made him the sole
channel of his official transactions: a circumstance
which my father perfectly knew how to turn to the
best advantage.</p>

<p>I too, in my capacity as the drogueman's chief
assistant and messenger, was in daily attendance at
the consular mansion; which proved useful to me
in one respect, as it gave me an opportunity of
learning the French language,&mdash;and that with the
greater fluency, from the circumstance of no one
offering expressly to teach me. The old consul
had, between his dignity with the Greeks and his
punctilio with the Turks, but little society, and I
therefore soon became by the sprightliness of my
repartees a very great favourite. Mr. de M&mdash;&mdash;
not only encouraged me to take a part in conversation,
but would even condescend to laugh
most heartily both at my witticisms and my practical
jokes, whenever neither himself, nor his servants,
nor his relations, nor his friends, nor his

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

proteg&eacute;s, were made to smart from their keenness
or involved in their consequences.</p>

<p>Mr. de M&mdash;&mdash; had an only daughter, the blue-eyed
Helena, the child of his old age. Deprived of
the watchful care of a mother, this lovely girl was
allowed in her father's house an unrestrained latitude,
and availed herself of her privilege with all
the freedom of unsuspecting innocence. The consul,
without being fond of music, loved the sound
of an instrument. Helena had been taught the
harpsichord, but, full of life and spirits, she hated
the mechanical drudgery of running over the cold
clumsy keys of a huge cumbrous fixture, to which
the performer, she thought, looked like a mere appendage.
Our light portable lyre, which the arms
encircle so gracefully and the fingers seem scarcely
to touch, she would learn to play upon most readily,&mdash;could
she but find a proper master! "Who
more so," thought I, "than the son of the father's
interpreter?"&mdash;and forthwith offered my services.
Though but a moderate performer, I had the advantage
of always being at hand, and, without
being positively either accepted or refused, was
soon employed.</p>

<p>Parents! who do not particularly wish your
daughters to fall in love with their teachers, be
cautious of admitting under your roof any music
masters, except such as are positive antidotes to
that passion. Where harmony alone is to rule the

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

sense, can souls remain unattuned to each other?
The boy's hand, in guiding the taper fingers of his
pupil, will sometimes make them stray from her
chords to his heart, and mistake for the vibrations
of the one the pulsations of the other. The very
lips of the fair one, accustomed to re-echo the sounds
of her teacher's voice, will by degrees respond to
his feelings; and he who has so many means of
disclosing his passion, and of insinuating a reciprocal
warmth, without any imputation of forwardness
or violation of respect, will be more anxious
to interpret the sounds he utters, than to disavow
their sense.</p>

<p>For my part, I almost immediately felt my heart
on fire, and soon Helena too caught the consuming
flame. Nothing could tear us away from each other.
The duets, begun in the heat of the day within
doors, were repeated in the cool of the evening on
the stone seat before the house. Sighs interrupted
the songs; and when the advancing night forced
Helena to retire, her blue eyes looked like drooping
violets steeped in dew.</p>

<p>The consul had destined his little favourite, as
soon as arrived at a suitable age, to a rich young
Smyrniote, nephew to his correspondent. He
dreamt not of the possibility of her falling in love
with a Greek boy, habited in the dress of the country,
and the son of his interpreter. It was rather a
gratification to him, on seeing us so much together,

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

to think that in her solitude his darling child should
have found the harmless pastime of our concerts.</p>

<p>My father saw deeper into the business. Had
he conceived it likely to end in a marriage, and that
marriage likely to bring his family any accession of
weight or of fortune, he would, I make no doubt,
have become as blind as he was deaf; but this he by
no means thought probable. The old consul was a
good deal distressed; his salary must cease with his
life, and he had nothing to leave his daughter at
his death but his consular pride;&mdash;"and with that
portion," observed my father, "she might indeed
become a gem of the first water in the hands of a
rich Smyrna merchant, who would set her in gold;
but round our bare necks she could only prove a
millstone." He therefore warned me against carrying
the intimacy too far.</p>

<p>His caution came too late. The less experience
my pupil at first brought to her lessons, the more
rapid was the progress she made under my tuition.
Love's fullest harmony was struck, almost ere she
suspected it whispered in our sighs. Indeed, so
much was she still in the first spring of her innocence,
that she scarce seemed aware that in due
time blossoms turned to fruits, till taught by experience.
On this discovery the timid girl at first
sobbed incessantly; but, by degrees, persuading
herself that our attachment, when divulged, must

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

end in our permanent union, she recovered a kind
of composure, and resolved to let the disclosure
take its course&mdash;neither hastening nor yet trying
to avert it; and rather rejoicing than dismayed
that the slim Perote<sup id="r013"><a href="#n013">13</a></sup> dress, which belonged to
her father's dignity, must betray the secret of his
villa sooner than the ample involutions of silk and
cotton, of which our own more wary females so
well know the advantages.</p>

<p>I by no means sympathised in this calmness, or
agreed in these wishes. What the too confiding
Helena looked upon as the harbour in which her
inquietudes must end, my father had taught me to
consider as the quicksand on which all my hopes
must perish. I therefore tried to impress Helena
with my utter inability to support her as my wife,
and with the expedience of such a timely confession
on her part, as should enable the consul to save
her honour without my inadequate assistance.</p>

<p>To the fair one flushed with love, the least
proffer of prudential considerations is an insult.
Exasperated at my discreet suggestions, Helena
treated me with haughtiness&mdash;with contempt.&mdash;"When
she could bring herself to stoop to my
lowness, did I fear any sacrifice that raised me to
her level?"</p>

<p>Feelings so proud as mine could ill brook this
taunting speech. To be told that I was to consider

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

as an honour beyond my deserts, the pennyless
hand of one whose heart had attested too warmly
my merits,&mdash;was this to be endured? All the
blood of Achilles rose within me; I ran to the quay,
and there let it rage in unison with the foaming
breakers.</p>

<p>As long as the Smyrna scheme had remained in
suspense, I saw an opening through which to escape;
but my father had just received an unqualified refusal
in that quarter. The merchant to whom he
applied in my behalf, being acquainted with my
brother's adventures, felt little anxious for another
scion of the same hopeful stock.</p>

<p>This disappointment had soured my father's temper,
and disposed him to visit on me the sins of
my brother. Having begun my education at the
wrong end, by permitting me every species of latitude
when he might easily have curbed my licentious
disposition, he now gave it the finishing touch with
equal sagacity, by trying, after my unbridled habits
had become confirmed, to restrain me even in
what I considered as reasonable freedom. I now
was thwarted in every wish, deprived of every indulgence,&mdash;and
all this, apparently, for no other
fault, except that from a chubby prattling child,
to be hushed with toys and sweetmeats, I had not
prevented myself from growing into a slouching,
thoughtful youth, who too often demanded a supply
of solid cash.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

<p>My mother, too, was to me an altered woman.
The moment I no longer submitted to be fondled
like a baby, she transferred her affections&mdash;against
all rule and precedent&mdash;from the former darling of
her heart to the one among us, who had neither the
claims of the youngest, nor of the eldest,&mdash;to Constantine.
His hump had evidently operated the revolution
in his favour; but whether, by making my
mother wish to console him for this defect, or, by
causing her to consider him as endowed with an
additional perfection, I never could determine. Certain
it is, that she used to gaze on his back as she
before had done on my face, until her admiration
sometimes put his own modesty to the blush.</p>

<p>Not habituated early enough to filial submission,
I no sooner felt the weight of parental authority,
than I began to question its justice, and, able to
deduce its rights only from the voluntary concession
of the child, while its feebleness forces it to barter
obedience for food, I considered its continuance
beyond that period as an usurpation. Long, therefore,
had I been meditating to seize some opportunity
of eluding the parental yoke, even before I got
entangled in the snares of love. The wound which
my mistress inflicted on my pride added new incentives
to my desire of liberty, and, after her mortifying
speech, the only wish of my mind was to
abandon father, mother, mistress, friends, relations,
and home for ever. Indeed, no way in which I

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

might sever myself from Helena seemed to me unfair,
when I considered the stamp of humiliating selfishness
which she had chosen to imprint upon my constancy.</p>

<p>My brain thus in a ferment, I entered the first
tavern I found open, and, though by no means
addicted to intemperance, drank off draught after
draught of our strongest wine, till the houses in
the street seemed familiarly to nod to the ships in
the harbour.</p>

<p>Among these latter was a Venetian brig, ready
for its departure. While I sat pondering over my
grievances, the evening breeze sprung up, and the
song of the sailors on board marked the heaving of
the anchor. I accepted it as the summons for putting
my design into execution. Running out of the
house, I was soon rowed to the vessel, and reached
it just as the sails were unfurling. I offered my services
to the captain. He had lost half his crew in
his last Egyptian caravan;<sup id="r014"><a href="#n014">14</a></sup> but still would only
receive me as a simple cabin boy. The office seemed
little suited to the son of a drogueman, whose garment
alone, I thought, should sweep the deck; but
it was not a time to bargain, and I submitted. I
crept into the hold among the ballast, until we
should be out of reach of pursuit, and, when informed
of my safety, jumped aloft, and ran to the stern to
see what way we had made.</p>

<p>The moon was just rising in all her splendor, and

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

a bar of silvery light shot along the spangled waves.
The gradually increasing breeze carried us rapidly
out of the straits of Chios. The different objects
on the shore&mdash;mountains, valleys, villages, and
steeples&mdash;seemed in swift succession first advancing
to meet us, then halting an instant alongside our
vessel as if to greet us on our passage, and lastly
again gliding off with equal speed&mdash;till, launched
into the open main, we saw the whole line of coast
gradually dissolve in distant darkness.</p>

<p>Various and opposite were the feelings which, as
I stood contemplating the luminous track we left in
the rippling wave, agitated my bosom: but, whatever
direction I tried to give to my thoughts, they
always reverted to Helena. In vain I sought to
banish from my guilt-struck fancy her upbraiding
image. As if in mockery of my endeavours, it
seemed to assume a tangible shape. I persuaded
myself that I actually saw the pale form of my mistress,
half rising from the boisterous billows, follow,
with piteous moans, the fleeting vessel, and call back
her Anastasius to her outstretched arms. I wished
I could have stayed the mighty mass,&mdash;could have
converted the swiftly moving keel, which hurried
away my person and my fate, into a solid motionless
rock&mdash;in order to enable the dear phantom to
join me, or, at least, in order to have a few instants
more to reflect on my conduct, and to retract my
errors, ere the opportunity should pass by for ever.

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

In vain! I felt as if an uncontrollable force kept
impelling me on,&mdash;and at last, "it is useless," I exclaimed,
"to contend! I must yield to my destiny:
I must perform the things set down for me&mdash;be they
good, or be they evil!"</p>

<p>As the dawn began to dispel the dark visions of
the night; as the sun rose in all his glory to pervade
the blue expanse of the heavens, and the returning
day showed Chios like a faint cloud, floating on the
utmost verge of the waters, my thoughts assumed
a brighter hue, my heart felt the weight which hung
upon it lightened, and the idea that I now was
going to explore those distant realms after which
I had yearned so long, filled me with expectation
and delight.</p>

<p>Yet even this new joy was mixed with a terror of
its own. At no period of my life had I yet outstepped
the narrow pale of my native island, or
obtained so much as a peep at the nearest objects,
beyond the straits by which it was bounded. A
passage to the neighbouring islets seemed to me a
long voyage. Smyrna had been, in my imagination,
the utmost limit of the habitable globe; and as to
Europe, I deemed it to lie somewhere not far from
the antipodes. The unbounded prospect of the
whole wide world bursting all at once upon me,
struck my young heart with awe; and the sight of
nothing around me but strangers, utterly unknown,
and indifferent to my fate, was sad and appalling.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

<p>Soon, however, I was recalled from these vague
and indistinct reflections, by feelings more definite
and more immediately connected with my present
situation. I had scarce closed my eyes, when the
captain, unwilling that I should have unpleasant
dreams, or any dreams at all, reminded me, with a
familiar tap on the shoulder, that it was time to
begin earning my passage; and handed me over to
his crew to instruct me in my task. Mine were no
longer indulgent teachers, and, from being the little
tyrant of my father's domestics, I now found myself
the slave of every common sailor. While my companions&mdash;my
masters, I should say&mdash;sat down to
their meals, I had to fast, and when they slept, I
must watch. Their scanty leavings were my food,
and it was only now and then that I could snatch
from my constant toil a few moments of hurried and
broken rest. Whatever awkwardness I showed was
followed by immediate blows; nay, it became a
standing joke of the unfeeling wretches to call me
to different places at once, that I might in some
incur the punishment of unavoidable delay. My
appeals to the mercy or the justice of my comrades
were treated with equal derision.</p>

<p>As I found it useless to complain, I stifled my
feelings, and only kept watching an opportunity
for escape or revenge. This made me particularly
observant of all the man&oelig;uvres of the captain;
some of which seemed sufficiently strange. At

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

times, for instance, when not a cloud was to be
seen in the sky, he would pretend to expect foul
weather, and run for shelter under some lonely
cliff, where he seemed more intent upon looking out
for something on the water than in the air; and
though he affected vast displeasure at the unceasing
drunkenness of his crew, one could almost have
sworn that he put flasks of brandy purposely in
their way.</p>

<p>One evening, in a profound calm, and while all
the sailors, drunk as fishes, were capering round a
tall pole crowned with myrtle, a boat full of Maynote<sup id="r015"><a href="#n015">15</a></sup>
pirates, concealed behind the frowning rocks
of Antiparos, stole unperceived under our stern,
and climbed up by the poop into the cabin. The
master, who just before had gone below on some
errand, and had been seized in the midst of his
business with a most unaccountable fit of sleeping,
was soon laid hold of and gagged. All the stand
of arms, neatly arranged round the room, were
next secured; and the pirates, now rushing up
stairs, easily mastered the few among the sailors
who were still able to stand upon their legs,&mdash;&mdash;after
which they had nothing to do but to bind, hands
and feet, the remainder, lying about the deck in a
state of perfect insensibility.</p>

<p>Amid the general intoxication, I had been kept
sober by my grief, and happened to stand near the
cabin door, just when, at the window opposite, appeared

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

the ugly features of the foremost of the
Maynotes, ready to slip in. My figure caught his
vigilant eye as he advanced his head, when, drawing
it back, he put his finger on his mouth, and
frowned most formidable threats, should I disobey
the sign. To this I felt not in the least inclined.
I might indeed, by giving the alarm immediately,
have saved the crew from the captain's treachery;
but all had used me ill alike. I therefore answered
the command by a gesture of ready compliance,
and let things take their course.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the fray the pirates affected
to treat the captain very outrageously; but this
appearance of enmity soon subsided, and by degrees
they sat down amicably together, like old friends
who understand each other's ways. Having so
handsomely performed my neutral part in the business,
I now was thinking to approach and put in
my claim, if not for poundage at least for hush-money,&mdash;when
a new incident most provokingly
blew up the well-concerted scheme.</p>

<p>It happened that just at this juncture, the famous
Hassan Capitan-Pasha<sup id="r016"><a href="#n016">16</a></sup> was in the act of delivering
the Morea from its Arnaoot<sup id="r017"><a href="#n017">17</a></sup> oppressors. One of
his caravellas,<sup id="r018"><a href="#n018">18</a></sup> stationed before Nauplia, by chance
espied our doings, and immediately gave us chase.
She soon obliged us to bring to; but, instead of
liberating the vessel, treated her as a lawful prize.
It is true that while the Turks tied the pirates

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

back to back, they only had the real owners of the
ship pinioned singly. The captain shared the fate
of his crew. Thus was poetical justice dealt out to
all, except myself; and thus was I, hapless Greek,
compelled, in the space of four days, to bear the
yoke of four different nations&mdash;French, Venetians,
Maynotes, and Turks. Whether I gained by
the last change, or only fell from Charybdis upon
Scylla, must remain untold till I have premised a
short account of the celebrated expedition which I
was so unexpectedly made to witness.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first war between the Russians and the
Turks, the most natural proceeding for Russia
would have been to attack Turkey from its southern
frontier, where the two countries joined:&mdash;the
most surprising was, to send an armament from its
northern extremity, whence the whole circumference
of Europe must be sailed round ere Turks and
Muscovites could meet. This latter, therefore, was
the measure preferred; and the Russian fleet had
passed, in its progress, a whole winter at Leghorn,
ere its commanders were determined in what part
of Turkey to strike the first blow. The Greeks
themselves decided the question for the avengers
they expected. A few turbulent Codgea-bashees<sup id="r019"><a href="#n019">19</a></sup>
of the Morea, fearing the lash of their Turkish governor,
sent to the Russian commanders a forged
plan of insurrection, as one already organised, and,
on the return of the deputation, employed the
promise of Russian assistance thus fraudulently
obtained, to produce the commotion which they
had described as already on the point of breaking
out. Their labour was assisted by the Turks themselves.
Suspecting a plot against their tyranny,

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

these pusillanimous oppressors acted like men who,
from the very fear of a precipice, plunge headlong
down the steep. In their panic they massacred a
whole troop of Zaccuniote peasants, peaceably returning
from a fair at Patras, whom they mistook
for an army of rebels marching to attack them.
The cry of revenge now resounded from all quarters;
and when therefore in the spring of 1770 the
Russian fleet cast anchor in the bay of Vitulo,
its commanders were received with open arms by
the bishops of Lacedemon<sup id="r020"><a href="#n020">20</a></sup> and of Christianopolis,
followed by Greeks of all descriptions, eager to
enlist under the Russian banners. Fair as seemed
this beginning, the understanding between the two
nations was short-lived. The Greeks expected the
Russians alone to accomplish the whole task of
their deliverance. The Russians had laid their
account with a powerful co-operation on the part
of the Greeks. Each alike disappointed, threw
on the other the whole blame of every failure.
Their squabbles gave large troops of Arnaoots time
to pour from every neighbouring point of Roumili
into the peninsula; and the Russian commanders,
seeing all chance of success vanish in that unpromising
quarter, sailed higher up the Archipelago,&mdash;leaving
the Moreotes to their fate, and carrying
away no other fruits of the momentary contact of
Greeks and Russians, but an increase of rancour
between the two nations,&mdash;too nearly allied in

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

faith, not to feel to each other the most cordial
aversion.</p>

<p>The ferocious mountaineers of Albania, who
under the name of Arnaoots form a chief part of
the forces of the Othoman empire, and of the body-guard
of its various Pashas, present in their rugged
and yet colourless countenances the greatest possible
contrast to the regular features and rich complexions
of the Greeks. In the faith of the two
nations the difference is less marked. Wavering
for the most part between Christ and Mohammed,
the worship of the Arnaoots is generally determined
by the master whom they serve; and many a buskined
hero<sup id="r021"><a href="#n021">21</a></sup> who came on the spur of pay and
plunder to assist the Moreote Moslemen against the
Christians, himself professed the Christian faith.
The total number of these savages was computed at
about twenty thousand; and when their work was
achieved, they demanded their wages. The money
was wanting, or at least the pay was withheld.
This furnished them with a plausible pretence for
disbanding on the spot, and paying themselves by
pillaging the country. Some, after laying waste
the villages, drove the inhabitants before them like
herds of cattle through the derwens or defiles that
guard the entrance of their peninsula, and thus
regained, with their new slaves, their native mountains.
Others remained stationary in the Morea:
by installing themselves in the houses and lands of

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

the Greek peasantry, deprived the soil of its husbandmen,
and the Turks of their subjects; and at
last, finding no more rayahs<sup id="r022"><a href="#n022">22</a></sup> to oppress, turned
their violence against the Moslemen themselves, and
treated like the vanquished foe those whom they
had come to defend.</p>

<p>Nine following years had seen eleven different
governors arrive, one after the other, with the most
peremptory instructions to exterminate the banditti,
and again depart without succeeding; some for
want of sufficient force to repress their outrages;
others, it is said, for want of sufficient resolution to
resist their bribes. At last the Porte sent Hassan.</p>

<p>By birth a Persian, by the fate of war a Turkish
slave, by choice received among the recruits yearly
raised at Smyrna for the Barbary powers, and by
his own merit advanced to the rank of Port-admiral
of Algiers, Hassan-bey became in a short time at
variance with the Dey. Justice was so entirely on
his side, that prudence urged his immediate flight.
After many wanderings, he found a patron at Constantinople
in the famous Raghib, Grand Visier<sup id="r023"><a href="#n023">23</a></sup>
under two successive Sultans, and who yet has
been permitted to die in his bed. In the memorable
battle which the Russians, after abandoning
the Morea, gave the Turks in the straits of
Chios, he commanded the admiral-ship of the
Turks, which was attacked by that of the Russians,
while the commanders of both the fleets,

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

Khassim and Orlow, kept with equal prudence aloof
from the fight. Prevented by his instructions from
unmooring, Hassan towed his ship on its anchors,
boarded the Russian vessel, and, only when both
hulks blown up together mingled their wrecks in
the sky, sought his safety in the sea, and swam
ashore. The Sultan, seeing his navy annihilated
and his person threatened in his Seraglio by a fleet
from the Baltic, now named Hassan his Capitan-Pasha,&mdash;and
was saved.</p>

<p>At the peace, this commander exerted himself to
form a new navy, and to introduce among the
Turks as much of European tactics as their prejudices
could bear. He had not very soon an opportunity
to try the effect of his improvements
against a foreign enemy; but, in an empire so extensive
as that founded by Othman, when age has
enfeebled its head, some distant extremity will
always refuse obedience, and call for compulsory
measures. Hassan constantly found in some quarter
disturbances to quell. In 1776, he made the
Arab Daher&mdash;usurper of the sovereignty of Acre&mdash;atone
with his life for the league he had formed
with the Egyptian rebel Aly. The year following
he punished Daher's sons for continuing the rebellion
of their father; and finally, in 1779, he
received the Sultan's orders to expel from the
Morea the refractory Arnaoots. Already was his
army encamped in the plains of Argos, when one

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

of the caravellas of his fleet stationed before
Nauplia conveyed our mixed party to that port,
where with my companions I was&mdash;unceremoniously
enough&mdash;stowed away for the night under a strong
guard in a crazy barn; wondering what was to be
our fate the next morning.</p>

<p>The place of our confinement had long been the
undisturbed domain of swarms of musquitoes, who,
ignorant of our unwillingness to trespass on their
premises, seemed determined to resist the encroachment
to the utmost. The constant buzzing and
stings of these troublesome insects would alone
have sufficed to deprive us of all chance of repose,
even had we not been so closely paired, through
means of good stout ropes, each with a companion
by no means of his choice; whence the blows which
each intended for his winged enemies, in general
only fell upon his pinioned associate. Excuses indeed
followed the undesigned offence, but were of
little use in composing us to sleep. My other, but
not my better half, in this forced union, seemed to
be the person most endowed with philosophic resignation
of our whole party. On my throwing
out a few hints respecting the inconvenience of our
bedchamber, he assured me that I was fastidious:&mdash;he
had often seen worse apartments, and without
the comfort of so much good company. This excited
my curiosity; and, observing that it was impossible
to think of sleeping, I entreated my patient

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

friend to favour me with the description of some of
those habitations, compared with which our present
abode was such a fairy palace.</p>

<p>"And so you wish," he cried, "to know my
adventures?&mdash;Well! and why not? You are young,
and seem of a promising disposition. My example
and my precepts cannot fail to benefit your inexperience,
and I will therefore this once do violence
to my natural modesty, in order to gratify your
wish for instruction. What in fact is the use of
great achievements, but to tell them? Only let me
entreat that your feeling heart may not be too deeply
touched by the distressing tale of my ill-rewarded
virtues.</p>

<p>"My early years," continued the person with
whom I was any thing but in <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, "offer
nothing remarkable. They were spent in the inglorious
occupation of cultivating my paternal soil.
I thought it rather hard upon me that, whether I
sowed my field or let it lie fallow, and whether it
was I that reaped its produce or the locusts, the
waywode<sup id="r024"><a href="#n024">24</a></sup> should equally exact the same enormous
yearly tithe, should look upon the destruction of
my crops by hail and tempests as the mere effects
of my own malice, and should seize upon my instruments
of husbandry, in order to make me more
industrious. I thought it harder still that, on hearing
how the conflagration of my hovel had consumed
all my haratsch tickets<sup id="r025"><a href="#n025">25</a></sup> for ten years back, he should

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

demand the whole sum, already paid, over again;
and I thought it hard beyond all bearing when,
having gone abroad to scrape together the money
exacted by my tyrant, I found, on coming home
again, my little patrimony confiscated to his profit,
as a punishment for abandoning that to which
I returned. In my rage I flung myself on the
ground, with my teeth gnawed the earth, that I
might at least carry away some morsel of my paternal
inheritance, and swore to make every Mohammedan
I could lay hands on, however innocent,
pay for the murderous waywode.</p>

<p>"This oath brought me good fortune. I succeeded
in sacrificing several victims to my just
resentment; and, as I chose by preference such as,
being in good circumstances, had most to lose, I
always made a point of retaining what I found about
them, lest other Mussulmen should profit by my
performance.</p>

<p>"Steadfast attention to this particular gave my
task a double interest. The only individual whom I
admitted to share with me, was the magistrate of the
district; except, of course, where he himself happened
to be the person stopped. Justice was much
the gainer by this proceeding. Instead of the usual
process of hanging a single wretch, the cadee<sup id="r026"><a href="#n026">26</a></sup>
generally fined the whole community, for not being
able to produce the offender.</p>

<p>"I had a distant cousin at Zante,&mdash;the flower of

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

the family, and so much admired by all ranks for
his bravery, that people used to contend for his
assistance in settling their affairs of honour. The
nobleness of his sentiments equalled his courage.
He only killed, as it were, to oblige his friends;
and so nice were his feelings, where his character was
concerned, that on being paid one day beforehand
by a certain nobleman, to chastise another sprig of
nobility, and, on mature deliberation, thinking the
reward too ample for the service, he despatched his
man outright, and so quieted his scruples&mdash;to the
great delight and surprise of his employer. But
these too disinterested sentiments at last obliging
him to quit Zante, where merit excites envy, he came
and joined me at Patras. From that period we
only went out in search of adventures together, like
Theseus and Pirithous, Orestes and Pylades, and
all the other worthies of old, whom my cousin had
at his fingers' ends;&mdash;and astonishing was the number
of monsters of which we rid the world, not only
above ground but under: for one night, in a cellar,
we killed half a dozen Arnaoots, lying dead drunk
on the spoils of our country; and that, without
any body the next day being the wiser, or thinking
but that the scoundrels had done the deed themselves,
in a frolic. Never did we take a fellow's
booty, whom we did not also rid of a life thus become
worthless to him. To do otherwise would have been
tempting Providence, and was against my oath. My

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

conscience being thus kept clear of premeditated sin,
and my mind regularly unburthened, by confession,
of unintentional offences, I continued to prosper,
until justice, entirely disregarding gratitude, chose
maliciously to turn against me. In disgust I joined
some Dulcignotes, who, with the help of Algerine colours,
avoided some awkwardness in taking christian
vessels. I myself had now begun to consider religious
prejudices as unworthy of a liberal mind, and to view
all men as equal before God. What right had I
to indulge in partialities founded upon my own
fallible judgment?&mdash;On this principle I no longer
made a difference between Turks and Christians,
and most conscientiously treated both alike. Still,
such is the force of habit, that I own I always felt
a particular zest in stripping an heretic. To this
moment my mouth waters at the thoughts of the
broad-bottomed Hollander, full of the richest spice
and dainties, which I once helped to unload. Its
crew had not&mdash;the reprobate wretches!&mdash;a single
image of a saint on board; and accordingly they
only went, with the wind right astern, at the rate of
two knots an hour; but the idols of their heart
seemed to be their short black tobacco-pipes. Even
when chucked into the sea, they still kept puffing
on, as long as their blubber-cheeks remained above
water. Their cargo set me up for a while, until
fresh misfortunes led back the way to my old trade.
The greatest piece of ill luck I reckon to have been
my partnership with our present captain. Had I

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

foreseen the bungler he would prove, I should have
carried my wits to a better market. But no matter!&mdash;The
most laudable intentions are sometimes defeated;
and a little rub disconcerts not Panayoti."</p>

<p>Highly edified with the incidents of this worthy
man's history, and still more with his candid and
unassuming manner of relating them, I almost regretted
that the dawn should so soon, through the
chinks of the wall, break in upon his artless and
unvarnished tale, to announce a speedy change of
scene. In fact, a few moments after, the doors of
our saloon were thrown open, and our party called
out to be formed into marching order. The separate
pairs, all strung together on a good thick
mediate rope, into a single body of small width but
handsome length, were thus made to add to the
beauty of distinctness of parts, that of unity of
whole; and, all set in motion by the simple mechanism
of a kick, bestowed in the rear of the
foremost pair, immediately advanced, guided by a
few spahees before, while others followed behind.
Argos was the place of our destination, and in less
than four hours our column reached Hassan's camp.
Not only all the troops of the province had flocked
round the commander's standard, but several Greeks
even had obtained permission to join the Turks
against those very Arnaoots whom, some years
before, the Turks had called in to save them from
the Greeks.</p>

<p>I had never seen an encampment, and the novel

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

and striking sight absorbed all my faculties in
astonishment and awe. There seemed to me to be
forces sufficient to subdue the whole world; and I
knew not which most to admire, the endless clusters
of tents, the enormous piles of armour, and the rows
of threatening cannon, which I met at every step,
or the troops of well mounted spahees,<sup id="r027"><a href="#n027">27</a></sup> who, like
dazzling meteors, darted by us on every side, amid
clouds of stifling dust. The very dirt with which
the nearer horsemen bespattered our humble troop
was, as I thought, imposing; and every thing upon
which I cast my eyes gave me a feeling of
nothingness, which made me shrink within myself
like a snail in its cell. I envied not only
those who were destined to share in all the glory
and success of the expedition, but even the meanest
follower of the camp, as a being of a superior order
to myself; and, when suddenly there arose a loud
flourish of trumpets, which, ending in a concert of
cymbals and other warlike instruments, re-echoed
in long peals from all the surrounding mountains,
the clang shook every nerve in my body, thrilled
me to the very soul, and infused in all my veins a
species of martial ardour so resistless, that it made
me struggle with my fetters, and try to tear them
asunder. Proud as I was by nature, I would have
knelt to whoever had offered to liberate my limbs,
and to arm my hands with a sword or a battle axe.</p>

<p>The tumult of my senses had not yet subsided,

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

when, leaving the camp on our right, we were
ushered into the open court of a small habitation, in
the town of Argos, there to undergo an interrogatory
from Hassan's drogueman. Fixtures as were we
under the azure canopy of the heavens, the sundials
on our faces had time to shift their shadows from
right to left before the gentleman came. At last he
arrived.</p>

<p>How widely things often differ in reality, that bear
the same names! In the drogueman of the Capitan-Pasha,
I had figured to myself a personage nearly
of the same stamp with the consular interpreter at
Chios, who had the honour of being my father. I
might as well have compared a wren to an eagle.
The individual of the Tergiumanic genus before
whom I now stood, came with the state of a little
prince, and seemed surrounded by a miniature court
of his own. When he spoke, his attendants only
answered in a whisper; at his slightest commands
they flew as if the fate of the empire were at stake,
and when he smiled at a joke of his own, they all
shook with laughter. As his movements were
abrupt and rather eccentric, it was amusing to see
them scamper after him, trying to keep close to his
heels, and not to be thrown out of their ranks by
his sudden vagaries.</p>

<p>From what cause it so happened I know not,
but the moment this great man addressed our captain,
who stood first and foremost of our troop, his

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

eye fell upon me, though one of the very last in
the many-jointed column; and from that time forward
he never more changed the object of his
attention. For the space of half a second or so, indeed,
he might glance at the intervening individuals
whom he successively interrogated; but, uniformly,
after addressing two or three words to them, his
eyes again began to wander, to seek something
further off, and, when they had found me, they
fixed themselves with their former steadfastness
upon my humble person. My business was to have
looked respectfully away from so exalted a personage,
or to have modestly dropped my eyelids, as if
I durst not encounter his sublime aspect. But this
I attempted in vain. As if under a fascination, I
scarce could keep myself from gazing on him with
the same steadiness with which he perseveringly
eyed me. I felt as if my future fate was to depend
upon his nod.</p>

<p>At last came my turn to speak. Questioned
respecting my birth, parentage, country, cause of
absence from home, and other topics, I told my
little tale with tolerable ease as well as veracity;
and my candour particularly shone in my strictures
on the captain, who had not perhaps yet had so
impartial and so observant a biographer. My recital
amused its noble auditor, and when finished:
"You little Greek rascal," exclaimed the drogueman,
"you will corrupt all these worthy Roman

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

catholics, if I leave you among them; so I'll keep
you here, and let them go home, to swing on
St. Mark's after their own fashion." With this
compliment my companions were dismissed. They
slunk away, muttering some curses, which under
the drogueman's mighty wing I could afford to
disregard.</p>

<p>Mavroyeni belonged to the most distinguished
family in the island of Paros. He had from a child
felt a spirit too expansive tamely to brook the restraint
of his confined birthplace. The restlessness
of his temper was increased by the predictions of a
priest of Sant-Irene,&mdash;one who foretold so much,
that it was impossible but something now and then
must fall out as he predicted. Fixing his eyes on
the little taooshan:<sup id="r028"><a href="#n028">28</a></sup> "Young man," cried he, as
if inspired, "brilliant will be thy career; but may
thy end be happy!" The first part of this twofold
oracle gave an additional stimulus to the youth's
ambition, the latter a new motive to his parents
for checking its sallies: but, like other predictions,
the one in question at last worked its own accomplishment.
When Hassan Capitan-Pasha made the
harbour of Drio the summer station of his squadron,
in its yearly cruise through the Archipelago, young
Mavroyeni threw himself so frequently in his way,
so anxiously implored his accepting an entertainment
from his father, and so successfully paid his court
during the feast, as to obtain from the Pasha

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

the promise of his protection at Constantinople.
Upon this he immediately went forth, plunged
headlong into all the intrigues of the Fanar,<sup id="r029"><a href="#n029">29</a></sup> and,
through his own dexterity, and the patronage of the
High-admiral, in less than three years supplanted
Argiropoli, the old and long respected drogueman
of the navy. He soon contrived to give his new
situation an importance which it never yet had
known. Former droguemen were nothing more
than interpreters and spokesmen, even to the most
imbecile and stupid of commanders. To the most
energetic and quicksighted of Pashas whom the
Turkish navy had yet obeyed, Mavroyeni became
an adviser and a friend. The lion at whose roar
Moslemen trembled, showed with the subtle Greek
the meekness of a lamb; and even when, informed
of his interpreter's unlawful transactions, Hassan for
a moment felt his anger rise, and swore he would
cut off the head that thus mocked his commands,
Mavroyeni's appearance was sufficient to turn his
master's wrath into complacency, and to draw down
new favours on that head just devoted to irrevocable
destruction. Every outrage of Mavroyeni's on the
laws and the habits of the Turks, only seemed
to increase his influence with his patron; and the
Greeks, still as prone as of old to ascribe each
strange effect to some supernatural cause, ceased
wondering at the drogueman's sway, only to wonder
at the drugs of which he composed his philtre.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Received</span> among the suite of the important
Tergiuman aforesaid,<sup id="r030"><a href="#n030">30</a></sup> I was soon made to exchange
my miserable tarred jacket of the sailor, for
an ample beneesh<sup id="r031"><a href="#n031">31</a></sup> of finest broadcloth, the first
mark of my promotion; but I could not help regretting
the loss of my "raven" locks, indifferently
replaced, in the owner's opinion, by the short black
lamb's wool of a clumsy calpack.<sup id="r032"><a href="#n032">32</a></sup> I swore I would
some day, cost what might, doff my uncouth headdress
for one of those smart turbans of gilt brocade,
worn with such a saucy air over one ear by the
Pasha's Tshawooshes,<sup id="r033"><a href="#n033">33</a></sup>&mdash;gentlemen who were seen
every where, lounging about as if they had nothing
to do but to display their handsome legs, their vests
stiff with gold lace, and their impudent bullying
faces.</p>

<p>I had confidently expected that my first apprenticeship
in my new service would have been to the
use of the carbine and the sabre. Great, therefore,
was my mortification when instead of learning to
shoot an enemy, or to cut down a rebel, I had to
practise carrying a coffee-pot, or presenting a tobacco-pipe:
and once, when a young fellow attendant
displayed his wit in jokes on my awkwardness,

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

my wrath waxed so high, that I thrust the lighted
pipe head foremost into his grinning mouth, and
made his pert tongue smart for its petulance. An
oldish mild looking man, a privileged domestic,
who, having served his time out, now earned his
salary as a sort of pedagogue to the new comers,
witnessed the act, and took me aside.</p>

<p>"Listen, young man," said he, "whether you
like it or not. For my own part, I have always
had too much indolence, not to make it my study
throughout life rather to secure ease than to labour
for distinction. It has therefore been my rule to
avoid cherishing in my patron any outrageous admiration
of my capacity, which would have increased
my dependence while it lasted, and exposed me to
persecution on wearing out:&mdash;but you, I see, are of
a different mettle: I therefore may point out to you
the surest way to that more perilous height, short
of which your ambition I doubt will not rest
satisfied. When you have compassed it, you may
remember old Demo, if you please.</p>

<p>"Know first that all masters, even the least
lovable, like to be loved. All wish to be served
from affection rather than duty. It flatters their
pride, and it gratifies their selfishness. They expect
from this personal motive a greater devotion to their
interest, and a more unlimited obedience to their
commands. A master looks upon mere fidelity in
his servant as his due,&mdash;as a thing scarce worth his

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

thanks: but attachment he considers as a compliment
to his merit, and, if at all generous, he will
reward it with liberality. Mavroyeni is more open
than any body to this species of flattery. Spare it
not therefore. If he speak to you kindly, let your
face brighten up. If he talk to you of his own
affairs, though it should only be to dispel the tedium
of conveying all day long other men's thoughts,
listen with the greatest eagerness. A single yawn,
and you are undone! Yet let not curiosity appear
your motive, but the delight only of being honoured
with his confidence. The more you appear
grateful for the least kindness, the oftener you
will receive important favours. Our ostentatious
drogueman will feel a pleasure in raising your
astonishment. His vanity knows no bounds. Give
it scope therefore. When he comes home choking
with its suppressed ebullitions, be their ready and
patient receptacle:&mdash;do more; discreetly help him
on in venting his conceit; provide him with a cue;
hint what you heard certain people, not knowing
you to be so near, say of his capacity, his merit,
and his influence. He wishes to persuade the
world that he completely rules the Pasha. Tell
him not flatly he does, but assume it as a thing
of general notoriety. Be neither too candid in
your remarks, nor too fulsome in your flattery.
Too palpable deviations from fact might appear
a satire on your master's understanding. Should

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

some disappointment evidently ruffle his temper,
appear not to conceive the possibility of his vanity
having received a mortification. Preserve the exact
medium between too cold a respect, and too presumptuous
a forwardness. However much Mavroyeni
may caress you in private, never seem
quite at ease with him in public. A master still
likes to remain master, or at least, to appear so to
others. Should you get into some scrape, wait not
to confess your imprudence, until concealment becomes
impossible; nor try to excuse the offence.
Rather than that you should, by so doing, appear
to make light of your guilt, exaggerate your self-upbraidings,
and throw yourself entirely upon the
drogueman's mercy. On all occasions take care
how you appear cleverer than your lord, even in
the splitting of a pen: or if you cannot avoid excelling
him in some trifle, give his own tuition all
the credit of your proficiency. Many things he will
dislike, only because they come not from himself.
Vindicate not your innocence when unjustly rebuked:
rather submit for the moment; and trust
that, though Mavroyeni never will expressly acknowledge
his error, he will in due time pay you
for your forbearance."</p>

<p>As it was not "<i>a single</i>" yawn with which I
answered this long speech, good old Demo vouchsafed
to spare me its sequel; but, though I thanked

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

not my adviser, I took care in due time to profit by
his advice.</p>

<p>Mavroyeni's situation subjected him to a species
of persecution which almost balanced the pleasure&mdash;great
as it was&mdash;of beholding the proudest Agas of
the country daily cringe at his levee, perhaps more
lowly than at that of the Pasha himself. It was the
annoyance of being visited by all his own relations
and kindred, from every island of the Archipelago,
far or near, large or small. He had not, in the remotest
corner of the Levant, a cousin in the fiftieth
degree, known or unknown, whom the fame of his
favour drew not out of his den to Argos, for the
purpose of sharing in the good things which it was
supposed the drogueman had nothing to do but
to give for the asking; and relationships, before
dormant or wholly obliterated, were now brought
to light, and supported by oral and written proof, so
as sometimes absolutely to confound even his not
easily shaken sturdiness.&mdash;Nor could these anxious
kinsfolks and friends be made to comprehend why
the particular time when Mavroyeni went forth
into public, or was surrounded by his whole court,
should not be the very best for bustling up to
their cousin, and roaring out their claims, or reminding
him of their former intimacies. All day
long they beset the drogueman's door when he was
at home, or lay in ambush for him when he went

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

out; and so great became at last the persecution,
that at every new disembarking of passengers
at Nauplia, he used to be seized with a fit of the
ague.</p>

<p>There is a danger in doing things too well. What
was at first volunteered as an extraordinary feat, is
soon assigned as an every day task. I once happened
to dismiss one of these troublesome visitors
too dexterously; and from that time it became my
regular office. The appointment, it is true, could
not have been in better hands. Without troubling
the drogueman for particular instructions, or annoying
him with awkward messages, painful to the
delicacy of a man who would rather have been
thought only allied to Jove, I knew at once when
a new face presented itself at the door, by its
cut and dimensions, whether it could conveniently
be suffered to pass the threshold, or not; and on
finding it either too long or too wide, or too red or
too shining, or otherwise inadmissible or questionable,
I resolutely defended the pass committed to my
care, was as formidably repulsive as Cerberus himself,
and minded not even a little scuffle in the cause:
sure of never being taxed by my master for disrespect
to his blood. Hence it happened that once
or twice, on the drogueman's expressing a fear that
certain of these visitors might call, I had the pleasure
to inform him that they had called, and would
call no more; after which, whenever a stranger was

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

announced, the answer, "let Anastasius go to him,"
was quite sufficient to explain the reception he was
to meet with, and the way in which his importunities
were to be treated.</p>

<p>By thus anticipating my master's sentiments, I rose
to such a degree of favour that often, after having
in public caused Turks of the highest rank to stare
at his haughtiness, he would in private put his humble
cafedjee<sup id="r034"><a href="#n034">34</a></sup> in no fear but from his excess of familiarity;
for frequently it left me almost unable to
bear in mind the old preceptor's caution, and to refrain
from overstepping my station. One evening,
after other conversation, "Anastasius," said the
drogueman, "I told the Pasha to-day what a
graceless stripling I had picked up. He will see
you to-morrow."</p>

<p>A person so terrible as this Pasha, and who so
filled the world with the mere sound of his name,
must, I thought, equal Homer's heroes in size. I
estimated his stature at the least at eight feet; and
accordingly, when ushered into his presence, kept
looking up at the ceiling till I nearly fell over a little
man squatted on the floor, whom I only recognised
by the commotion which my heedlessness excited,
as the formidable Hassan. I know not whether the
Pasha felt nettled at the abruptness of my approach
or had been discomposed before; but when, ready to
sink into the ground with dismay, I stepped back to
repair my blunder and kiss the hem of his garment,

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

he no more heeded me than the dust of his feet which
I respectfully brought to my forehead. Mavroyeni
soon perceived that the moment was inauspicious,
and made me a sign to withdraw. I immediately
slunk away.</p>

<p>There is a something in my nature which revolts
at every act of humiliation performed towards a
fellow creature. Nothing but the extreme kindness
of Mavroyeni could reconcile me to my servile situation;
and his indulgence had made me expect equal
caresses from Hassan himself: "I only stoop,"
thought I, when appearing before him, "to rise the
higher." But when I found myself left in the dust
in which I had been cringing, without gaining any
thing by my submission but a contemptuous look,
how deep in my heart sunk the mortification! Scarce
could I contain myself while hurrying out of the
room. On the very threshold I burst into a flood
of tears.</p>

<p>Fresh constraint, however, soon again became necessary.
My fellow attendants, to whom I had been
boasting of my summons, were all waiting in a row,
to know the result of my visit. Lest its luckless
termination should make them too happy, I had to
convert my sobs into smiles, at the inexpressible
graciousness of my reception.</p>

<p>The principal tribe of the rebellious Arnaoots,
the Beckiarees, established to the number of about
ten thousand in the very capital of the Morea, kept

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

its governor, Mehemet Pasha, as some supposed a
willing prisoner. Hassan, ere he engaged in actual
hostilities, once more offered them, on condition of
immediately quitting the country, an unqualified
pardon; but the hardened banditti, whether confiding
in their numbers or in other less apparent
means of averting the blow, rejected all compromise,
intrenched themselves under the walls of the city,
and bade defiance to the Pasha's forces.</p>

<p>Probably they expected to awe him by this show
of resolution. They were deceived. On the tenth
of June, about noon, Hassan set out with four
thousand picked men for Tripolizza, and continued
on the march the whole night. Mavroyeni followed
the Pasha, and I followed Mavroyeni. In my capacity
of Greek, and still more of cafedjee, I had
not the least hope of personally contending with the
foe, and all my solace was the chance of a sly thrust
at some run-away. But my master, desirous to let
me have my share of all the good things that offered,
after whispering something in the Pasha's ear, suddenly
turned round to me: "Anastasius," he cried,
"I have obtained his highness's permission for you
to shoulder a musket, and to join in the fight, like
an Osmanlee."<sup id="r035"><a href="#n035">35</a></sup></p>

<p>The favour, no doubt, was inestimable; but its
suddenness somewhat confounded me. I felt, however,
that I must seem delighted, and though with
something of a flutter about my heart, endeavoured

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

to look all joy in the face. In order to confirm my
assurance of unutterable satisfaction, I kept singing
all the way,&mdash;though now and then, perhaps, a
little out of tune. But let it be recollected what I
was:&mdash;a Greek, in whose unlicensed hands a musket
had been deemed, until that moment, a sacrilege,
and who had only learnt by stealth to take aim at
a sparrow.</p>

<p>I shall therefore not attempt to deny that when
the early dawn showed in front of our column, between
ourselves and Tripolizza, at the distance of
only a few hundred yards the whole Albanese encampment,
my stout heart began to beat; and that
when, the next moment, I heard Hassan give orders
for the charge, breath seemed for a moment to forsake
my frame. Shame, however, supplied the place of
bravery. The danger which I could not avoid I determined
not to think of; and, following the example
of the more experienced warriors around me, I swallowed
in a hurried manner several copious draughts
of a certain nameless liquor, which, on particular occasions,
the High-admiral wisely allowed himself to
distribute among his followers; whereupon, whether
it be that the inspiring potation did its duty, or that
courage is infectious like cowardice, my heart, the
very moment before almost sunk to my heels, rebounded
with such energy, that in its ebullitions
of bravery, I could scarce refrain from breaking
from the ranks, and engaging some hero of the

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

adverse party in single combat, even before the line
was formed;&mdash;and when the trumpet sounded the
charge, when the onset began, and the whole body
of cavalry at once rushed forward, causing the earth
to shake under the horses' hoofs, such grew my delirium,
that I scarce saw, heard, or felt; much less
had senses to think.</p>

<p>Mavroyeni had taken care to confide his cafedjee,
excellently mounted, to a trusty spahee, whose side
he enjoined me not to quit. But at that moment
not heaven itself could have prevented my giving
the reins to my warlike spirit. The cloud of smoke
which arose soon baffling the vigilance of my guardian,
I gave him the slip, and spurring my steed
with all my might, at once plunged into the thickest
of the fray. There, finding the loading of my
pistols too tedious a process, I began hacking and
hewing with my yatagan;<sup id="r036"><a href="#n036">36</a></sup>&mdash;consoling myself for
any mistake I might make in the objects of my ire,
with the thought that my blows never could fall
amiss, where all alike were enemies to Christianity,
and oppressors of the Greeks. If upon this principle
I hit one or two of our own men, too much
engaged to heed whence came the compliment, I
made amends by cutting down as grim an Arnaoot
as ever wore red whiskers, in the very act of
measuring one of our spahees for a back-handed
blow; and by this feat, so happily timed, and more
happily observed, gained prodigious credit. It

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

elated me to such a degree, that, thinking myself
quite invulnerable, I was going next to rush headlong
amidst the only little knot of Lalleotes which
still maintained its ground,&mdash;when my guardian,
again catching a glimpse of my person, stopped my
mad career, grasped me by the arm, and, spite
of my despair at not seeing the end of an affair
in which I had taken such an active part, began
dragging me away: but the rout of the Arnaoots
becoming decisive just at that very moment, he
listened to the intreaties of those who had witnessed
my behaviour, and again let me go. I darted forward
like an arrow from the bow, and gave chase
to the now dispersing foe.</p>

<p>Foremost in the attack, I was soon foremost in
the pursuit. Among the Albanians flying before
us like chaff before the wind two particularly
caught my eye, while apart from the rest they
sought concealment behind a small patch of furzes.
Steadfastly watching their progress, and tracing
their route by the motion of the bushes, I left the
rest of the troop, to follow this promising scent.
Fortunately my fugitives, instead of turning short
upon me to punish my imprudence, in their panic
only pushed forward, until the hindmost getting
entangled among the briars, presented his side to
the contents of my carbine, and bit the dust; while
the other only ran the faster for his comrade's
groans.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

<p>My great ambition had been to take a prisoner,&mdash;to
possess a slave. I therefore left the disabled
man, as secure, to his own meditations, and with
my biggest voice called to his companion to surrender.
Luckily he did not even look round at
the stripling who addressed him; but presently,
leaping down a little eminence, disappeared in a
thicket, where I thought it prudent to give up the
hazardous chase.</p>

<p>I now returned to the fellow whom I had left
writhing on the ground, apparently at the last
gasp; and when sufficiently near, lest there should
still lurk about him some latent spark of life,
which might only wait to spend itself in a last home
thrust, swiftly sprung forward, and, for fear of
foul play, put an extinguisher upon it, ere I ventured
to take any other liberties with his person.
This done, I deliberately proceeded to the work of
spoliation. With a hand all trembling with joy, I
first took the silver mounted pistols, and glittering
poniard, and costly yatagan; I next collected the
massy knobs of the jacket, and clasps of the
buskins, and still more valuable sequins lying
perdue in the folds of the sash; and lastly, feeling
my appetite for plunder increase in proportion
as it was gratified, thought it such a pity to leave
any part of so showy an attire a prey to corruption,
that I undressed the dead man completely.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

<p>When however the business which engaged all
my attention was entirely achieved, and that human
body, of which, in the eagerness for its spoil, I had
only thus far noticed the separate limbs one by
one, as I stripped them, all at once struck my sight
in its full dimensions, as it lay naked before me;&mdash;when
I contemplated that fine athletic frame, but a
moment before full of life and vigor unto its fingers'
ends, now rendered an insensible corpse by the
random shot of a raw youth whom in close combat
its little finger might have crushed, I could not
help feeling, mixed with my exultation, a sort of
shame, as if for a cowardly advantage obtained over
a superior being; and, in order to make a kind of
atonement to the shade of an Epirote&mdash;of a kinsman&mdash;I
exclaimed with outstretched hands, "Cursed
be the paltry dust which turns the warrior's arm
into a mere engine, and striking from afar an invisible
blow, carries death no one knows whence to
no one knows whom; levels the strong with the
weak, the brave with the dastardly; and, enabling
the feeblest hand to wield its fatal lightning, makes
the conqueror slay without anger, and the conquered
die without glory!"</p>

<p>On the very point of departing after this sort
of expiatory effusion, with my heavy but valuable
trophy huddled on my back, the thought struck me
that I might incur a suspicion of sporting plumes
not my own, unless I brought my vouchers. With

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

that view I began detaching from my Arnaoot's
shaggy skull both the ears, as pledges for the remainder
of the head, when I should be at leisure
to fetch it; but considering how many gleaners
stalked the harvest field, and that if I lost my own
head, none other might be found to make me
amends, I determined to take at once all I meant
to keep. The work was a tough one, and the operator
at best still a bungler, but I succeeded at
last;&mdash;and now, in an ecstacy of delight, though
almost afraid to look at my bundle, I returned to
our party&mdash;for ever cured, by an almost instantaneous
transition to temerity, of every sentiment of
fear. Indeed such remained for some time the ferment
of my spirits, that, while I carried my load
on one arm, I kept brandishing my sword with the
other, still eager to lay about me, and to cut down
whomsoever I met.</p>

<p>My master,&mdash;already informed of my prowess,
and on the look-out for my return,&mdash;seeing me
arrive thus fierce and turbulent, immediately cried
out: "Bravo, Anastasius! At your first outset,
you are become a complete hero.&mdash;But," added
he, laughing, "since the fight is over, and the
enemy routed, suppose you put up your sword, and
wash your face!"</p>

<p>The advice was seasonable. I had in the heat
of the engagement received, I know not how, a cut
across the jaw, of which the scar remains to this

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

day, and shows a shining white ridge across my
strong black beard.</p>

<p>The head<sup id="r037"><a href="#n037">37</a></sup> which, in imitation of my companions,
I laid before the Pasha, he only treated as a football;&mdash;an
usage which made me feel vexed for its
dignity and my own: but when the whole harvest
was got in, he ordered the produce to be built into
the base of a handsome pyramid. The remaining
Arnaoots of the peninsula, cut off at the dervens,
afterwards supplied its top, and thus afforded the
inhabitants of Tripolizza a most agreeable vista,
which they enjoy to this day. One of our men,
indeed, attempted to keep back from the common
store a skull of his own collecting, meaning to turn
it into a drinking cup for private use: but the Pasha
severely censured an idea "so disgraceful," he observed,
"to a civilized nation like the Turks;" and
was near making its author, in punishment of his
offence, contribute to the building materials from
his own stock. As for myself, when I came to
offer my mite I found that same Hassan, before so
supercilious, all condescension. Bravery was with
him the first of virtues: some said the only one!&mdash;Mine
he paid in ready money, with a handful of
sequins; adding: "you are a lad of spirit; and if
you will but become a true believer, you may rely
upon me for promotion."</p>

<p>At this flattering offer, my heart rose to my lips.
At once I would have answered: "Moslemin, or

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

heathen, or whatever your highness pleases!"&mdash;but
a look from my master stopped my complying
speech. I read in it a positive prohibition, and
durst not disobey. Prostrating myself on the
ground, I begged the Pasha would command his
servant any thing but to renounce his precious
faith. This behaviour had the good luck not to
displease the Visier, and much to gratify the interpreter.
It entirely gained me the heart of a
nephew of Mavroyeni, his uncle's agent, named
Stephan;&mdash;a man who was said to keep his accounts
between this world and the next much more
even than his older relation. Indeed, so little had
the drogueman the reputation of being tenacious on
the score of religion, that I could not refrain from
asking him, the first instant we were alone together:
"why he should thus have stood in the way of his
servant's fortune?"</p>

<p>"You fool," was his answer, "I only stood in
the way of your ruin. Had you accepted the High-admiral's
proposal, you would immediately have
received some inferior appointment, and in that you
would have been left to waste the remainder of your
life. Your first promotion would have been your
last. Despised by the Turks and shunned by the
Greeks, you would have found support nowhere;
and must henceforth have lived not only degraded,
but, what is worse, forgotten. Has it never struck
you," added he in a whisper, and as if afraid of

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

being overheard, "that if much were to be gained
by a Christian turning Moslemin, there are others
besides yourself sufficiently reasonable not to stick
at the difference between Kyrie ele&iuml;son, and Allah,
Illah, Allah?"<sup id="r038"><a href="#n038">38</a></sup></p>

<p>This observation set all reply at defiance. I laid
by my sword, and resumed my coffee-tray.</p>

<p>The interior of the Morea being liberated from the
Albanians, Hassan determined to spend the remainder
of the season in clearing its seas of the Maynotes.
A strong detachment was sent with instructions to
force the passes of mount Taygetus, the abode of
those miscreants; and our encampment was in the
mean time removed from the plain of Argos to that
of Nauplia. Precisely the small slip of this otherwise
delightful valley which is closest to the city,
and extends under the tremendous rock of the
Palamida, had, by the sea water constantly oozing
in, been rendered a swamp, vying for noxious
exhalations with the opposite morass of Lerna.
Hassan, while waiting the issue of the expedition
to Mayno, resolved, without knowing much of the
garden of the Hesperides, to make this pestilential
nook its fac-simile,&mdash;and, by way of restoring to their
pristine innocence and purity the somewhat deteriorated
minds of his Arnaoot prisoners, had them
conveyed on shore every morning, chained two and
two, to forward this rural design. Hands that
never yet had wielded any thing but weapons of war

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

and destruction, were now reluctantly seen to grasp
instruments of peace and husbandry, and to exchange
the sword and the carbine for the rake and the
spade; and men only accustomed to cut and clip
human limbs, gnashed their teeth with rage, at
being compelled to prune orange-trees, and to tie
up carnations.</p>

<p>Like other distinguished personages, Hassan had
his enemies in the capital. They represented his
attempt on the impregnable fastnesses of Mayno as
a mad scheme; they ceased not to inveigh against
his extortions: but the crime they dwelt upon with
peculiar eloquence and pathos, was his atrocity in
employing Mohammedan captives to lay out his
vile shrubberies; and one morning that Hassan, in
the midst of his works, was inhaling in copious
streams the incense of his courtiers vying in compliments
on his taste, came a fulminating hatti-sherif
from the Porte, to enjoin the immediate liberation
of all his prisoners, and the return of his
squadron to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Vain would be the attempt to paint the Pasha's
rage. Striking his forehead with the imperial
mandate, he swore he would obey its commands&mdash;would
deliver his prisoners from their bondage: but
only in death! and ordered them to be marshalled
for immediate execution. The signal was given;
and at each waving of his hand fell a head. Every
beholder looked aghast, but none durst breathe

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

even a syllable of intercession for the victims.
Fifteen heads already lay gasping amidst the parterres
which their wearers had planted; and seemed
only a prelude to the fall of as many hundreds:
when Mavroyeni at last stepped forward, and,
throwing himself at his master's feet, begged he
would have mercy, not on the culprits, who deserved
their fate, but on his own innocent lilies and jesmines,
which had done nothing to deserve being
deluged in blood, instead of moistened only by the
dews from heaven.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Pasha himself had already begun to
reflect, not on the cruelty of his conduct, but on its
consequences;&mdash;perhaps he was not sorry for an
excuse to desist from his rash vow. His jocularity,
between each new act of the disgusting spectacle,
might only in reality be intended to slacken the
progress of the slaughter. The flowers were pitied,
the massacre stopped, the garden abandoned, and
the not yet pollarded Arnaoots conveyed to the passes
out of the Morea, there to be turned loose upon the
remainder of the Turkish empire.</p>

<p>By the sacrifice of a few of the purses which he
had collected, Hassan still obtained leave only to
resign the command of the Morea to Hadgee
Ibrahim, his own kehaya:<sup id="r039"><a href="#n039">39</a></sup> a man who, in turns
pilgrim at Mecca, chief of banditti in Roumili,<sup id="r040"><a href="#n040">40</a></sup>
slave-merchant on the Black Sea, and soldier at the
Dardanelles, was by no means the Pasha's unapt

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

representative; but who nevertheless was only allowed
to succeed him with the subordinate rank of
Moohassil,<sup id="r041"><a href="#n041">41</a></sup>&mdash;the exhausted state of the Peninsula
disabling it from supporting, in a governor, the burthensome
weight of the three tails.</p>

<p>The news of the entire failure of the Maynote
expedition became the signal for our departure. In
my impatience to behold the capital I had been
counting the days and hours till we should sail, and
had been frightened by many a report of our wintering
at Nauplia. Inexpressible therefore was my joy
when, on the fifteenth of November 1779, I actually
saw the anchors heaving, and the sails unfurled.</p>

<p>Behold me now at sea a second time, not like the
first on board a paltry trading vessel, only surrounded
by tarred sailors, and myself toiling like
a galley slave, but in a superb three-decker&mdash;a positive
moving city on the waves; basking in the sunshine
of a visier of the first class; viewing, whichever
way I turned my eyes, glittering officers and
guards; and having nothing myself to do but to
wonder at all I saw. This I did abundantly. Not
a hole or corner of the vessel was left unexplored;
and, though exceedingly wroth on board the Venetian
at being obliged to bear a part in working the
ship, which I then thought an intolerable drudgery,
I here, on the contrary, from being very much discouraged
by the sailors in my attempts to assist
them, found no pleasure so great; and was constantly

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

lending a hand in setting the sails, bracing
the yards, and imitating like a monkey all I saw
others do. Frequently, when my master sent for
me to my berth below, I was up in the main top;
and I seldom came down from this favourite station,
except to listen open-mouthed on the carriage of a
gun to the glowing descriptions of the wonders and
delights of the capital&mdash;the city by pre-eminence,&mdash;which
some one or other of my companions was constantly
praising. It seemed to me, though the wind
continued unabatingly fair, that we never were to
reach this earthly paradise.</p>

<p>On one occasion indeed the current of my thoughts,
thus far uninterruptedly directed toward Stambool,<sup id="r042"><a href="#n042">42</a></sup>
experienced a sudden stop, a total reflux. The intellectual
tide, till then only flowing in one direction,
at once ebbed, and set the contrary way. It
was when we came in sight of my native land, of
my beloved Chios. While rapidly sailing before the
wind along its verdant shores, a pang shot to my
heart,&mdash;an indescribable yearning seized upon my
soul. At the back of that ridge of purple crags
which I could almost touch with my hand, lived my
aged parents; lived, sighed&mdash;perhaps, sighed no
longer&mdash;my injured Helena, the first loved of my
heart! Were not the rocky screen betwixt, I might
actually at that instant behold their now melancholy
homes, and in less than an hour I might restore the
mourning tenants to their wonted serenity. I might

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

receive and bestow the embraces of love and of duty;
I might again possess the united blessings of those
whom I had so cruelly abandoned; I might tell
them, "Anastasius has fought, Anastasius has vanquished,
Anastasius returns to you. He returns to
deposit at your adored feet, and to sacrifice to your
love and your pardon, the laurels he has gathered,
and the praise and promises he has gained." "Now
is," thought I&mdash;"but soon irretrievably to vanish&mdash;the
moment in which to recover kindred, country,
peace of mind, and connubial happiness. If again
cast away, they must be lost for ever!"</p>

<p>Frantic at this thought, I hastily left the deck,
and hurried to the drogueman, to entreat that I
might be put ashore, and allowed to return among
my friends.</p>

<p>On what trifling circumstances depends the fate
of our lives! Had I felt less anxious, I should
have succeeded: I should have reached my master's
presence, have preferred my petition, have obtained
my suit, have been reinstated in my filial privileges,
and probably at this time have been the happy
father of a numerous progeny, with the soothing
prospect of a tranquil and respected old age.</p>

<p>A nail-head made the difference!&mdash;A nail-head
causes me, by remote consequences, at the distance
of many years, to die in a strange land a premature
and painful death, unowned by a friend, unwept by
a child! This unfortunate iron (on which may lie all

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

my sins) not being sufficiently clenched, protruded
most unwarrantably from the steps of the cabin.
Several times already it had caught my flowing
dress; and each time condemned to decapitation, it
had only been reprieved from sheer thoughtlessness.
In the eagerness of the moment, I hooked it with
my shaksheer,<sup id="r043"><a href="#n043">43</a></sup> as I ran down stairs, and, losing my
balance, fell, and struck my skull against the floor
of the cabin.</p>

<p>Senseless from the shock, I only recovered to find
myself lying on the deck, with my head in the lap
of one of the Pasha's tshawooshes. The first thing
upon which my eyes opened was the officer's vest,&mdash;one
of those gorgeous specimens of embroidery,
which I had so greedily coveted, and had so fully determined
some day to obtain: the first thing I heard
was a condescending message of inquiry from the
Pasha himself! So much glare dazzled my senses;
so great an honour overpowered my weak brain. For
some time, indeed, I scarce could remember what
had occupied my thoughts prior to my accident.
All in my mind was confusion and darkness; and
when I again began with some clearness to retrace
my ideas, the contact was too immediate with one
species of object near my heart, not to feel the attraction
of other more distant treasures, weak in comparison.
It now seemed to me a womanly act to cast
away all the fruit of the perils I had past, of the
reputation I had gained, and of the favour I had

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

earned;&mdash;to exchange the fame and greatness that
awaited me, for obscurity and oblivion; to prefer to
the destinies of the eagle, soaring from region to region,
those of the worm, content to die in the same
clod of clay in which he was born, and perhaps
crushed to death before his time, by the more bold
and aspiring. I knew I should be laughed at by all
on board, only for hinting such a whim; and, on further
reflection, I even felt it a filial duty to seek at
Constantinople that rank, which might be so powerful
a protection to my parents on their little island.</p>

<p>Still, however, some inward doubt remained. As
soon as I was able to move, I rose, and ran to the
side of the ship, to see what way she had been
making since my accident, and whether there still
was time to execute my design. Chios had already
dwindled away into a scarce visible speck. The
magnet ceased to act; my lately excited feelings
subsided, and my no longer distracted mind gradually
resumed its former hopes, its vanities, and
its ambition. Its current again, as before, only
flowed whither our prow was tending. Stambool
again became, as before, its polar star;&mdash;and if some
natural regrets still arose in my mind at intervals,
the new and bustling scene which ensued, during
the few days we lay at anchor before Mitylene and
Tenedos, completely dispelled them. These days
appeared to me so many ages, only from their delaying
our arrival in the capital.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

<p>At last we entered the boghaz!<sup id="r044"><a href="#n044">44</a></sup> Stunned by
the incessant thundering of the almost uninterrupted
succession of batteries, which line the whole of its
shore, I felt not the less as if sharing all the honours
of their salutes, and could scarce repress my joy and
exultation. In a few hours I was to behold that
celebrated city, whose origin lay hid in the obscurity
of ages, whose ancient greatness had often been the
theme of my infant wonder, and whose humiliation
under the Othoman yoke I had, in concert with my
didaskalos<sup id="r045"><a href="#n045">45</a></sup> of Chios, frequently lamented with tears;
but which&mdash;even in its present degraded state, and
groaning under the despotism of the Turks&mdash;had
from a child been the final object of all my views
and wishes.</p>

<p>A most favourable wind continued to swell our
sails. Our mighty keel shot rapidly through the
waves of the Propontis, foaming before our prow.
Every instant the vessel seemed to advance with accelerated
speed; as if&mdash;become animated&mdash;it felt the
near approach to its place of rest; and at last Constantinople
rose, in all its grandeur, before us.</p>

<p>With eyes riveted on the expanding splendours I
watched, as they rose out of the bosom of the surrounding
waters, the pointed minarets, the swelling
cupolas, and the innumerable habitations, either
stretching along the jagged shore, and reflecting
their image in the mirror of the deep, or creeping
up the crested mountain, and tracing their outline

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

on the expanse of the sky. At first agglomerated
in a single confused mass, the lesser parts of this immense
whole seemed, as we advanced, by degrees to
unfold, to disengage themselves from each other,
and to grow into various groups, divided by wide
chasms and deep indentures,&mdash;until at last the clusters,
thus far still distantly connected, became transformed,
as if by magic, into three distinct cities,<sup id="r046"><a href="#n046">46</a></sup>
each individually of prodigious extent, and each separated
from the other two by a wide arm of that sea
whose silver tide encompassed their base, and made
its vast circuit rest half on Europe, and half on Asia.
Entranced by the magnificent spectacle, I felt as if
all the faculties of my soul were insufficient fully
to embrace its glories: I hardly retained power to
breathe; and almost apprehended that in doing so,
I might dispel the gorgeous vision, and find its
whole vast fabric only a delusive dream!</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with difficulty that I could collect my scattered
senses, when the time came to step down into
the nut-shell, all azure and gold, which waited to
convey the drogueman's suite to the Fanar, where,
with the other principal Greeks, Mavroyeni had his
residence. Each stroke of the oar, after we had
pushed off from the ship, made our light ca&iuml;ck<sup id="r047"><a href="#n047">47</a></sup> glide
by some new palace, more splendid than those which
preceded it; and every fresh edifice I beheld, grander
in its appearance than the former, was immediately
set down in my mind as my master's habitation. I
began to feel uneasy when I perceived that we had
passed the handsomest district, and were advancing
towards a less showy quarter. My pangs increased
as we were made to step ashore on a mean-looking
quay, and to turn into a narrow dirty lane; and I
attained the acme of my dismay, when, arrived opposite
a house of a dark and dingy hue, apparently
crumbling to pieces with age and neglect,<sup id="r048"><a href="#n048">48</a></sup> I was
told that there lived the lord Mavroyeni. At
first I tried to persuade myself that my companions
were joking; but, too soon assured they only spoke

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

the truth, I entered with a fainting heart. A new
surprise awaited me within. That mean fir-wood
case of such forbidding exterior, contained rooms
furnished in all the splendour of eastern magnificence.
Persian carpets covered the floors, Genoa
velvets clothed the walls, and gilt trellis work overcast
the lofty ceilings. Clouds of rich perfumes rose
on all sides from silver censers; and soon I found
that this dismal outside appearance was an homage
paid by the cunning of the Greek gentry to the
fanaticism of the Turkish mob, impatient of whatever
may, in Christians, savour of luxury and ostentation.
The persons of the Fanariote grandees were
of a piece with their habitations. Within doors,
sinking under the weight of rich furs, costly shawls,
jewels, and trinkets, they went forth into the streets
wrapped in coarse, and dingy, and often thread-bare
clothing.</p>

<p>My arrival in the capital was almost immediately
followed by an advancement from my private situation,
to a more public office. Whether the drogueman
of the Capitan-Pasha thought it unbecoming a
sprig of his own body&mdash;a drogueman's son&mdash;to appear
in the capacity of a domestic, or whether he
conceived that a taooshan like himself, unconnected
with his rivals in office, and entirely dependent on
his nod, was, in point of trust-worthiness, the next
thing to a mamluke;<sup id="r049"><a href="#n049">49</a></sup> or whether, finally, he considered
my acquirements and my capabilities, as

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

above being confined within the compass of a coffee-tray
or the extent of a Persian pipe, he had scarce
had time to look about him, ere he conferred upon
me the employment&mdash;or rather the dignity&mdash;of relieving
him in some of the lesser details of his business.
These chiefly consisted in attending every day
at the arsenal, there to introduce to the High-admiral
the persons and to interpret the petitions, of
Greeks and of foreigners;&mdash;for in the style of the
Turkish diplomacy, a Christian ambassador demanding
an audience was introduced as a supplicant
preferring a suit.</p>

<p>While, to perform the duties of his office, Mavroyeni
himself held his usual station in the Capitan-Pasha's
own apartment, I was installed in a small
adjoining room, where I had to hear, to understand
if I could, or, whether I understood or not, to set
down and to condense into the shortest possible
written abstract, the long stories of petitioners and
the endless dialogues of disputants; a duty, which
I always performed the better in proportion as I
understood the business brought before me the less.
It was here I learnt that art of generalising my ideas,
so esteemed, as I am told, among Frank<sup id="r050"><a href="#n050">50</a></sup> philosophers.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, had the choice been laid before me,
I should have preferred the truncheon to the pen.
But the drogueman had not the former in his gift;
and the tedium of the latter was materially relieved

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

by certain circumstances attached to its exercise.
For it soon became notorious that nothing assisted
me so much in giving weight to a case, as a few
sequins slipped from sheer absence of mind between
the pages of the report; and in this respect the difference
between my master and myself only consisted
in his receiving purses,<sup id="r051"><a href="#n051">51</a></sup> where I received
single pieces.</p>

<p>Still, to one who loved money only as the means
of pleasure, my confinement could not but be irksome;
and the moment Mavroyeni disappeared I
too used to break up my levees, and to saunter
about. Whenever my master was employed by the
Pasha in some long-winded expedition, I proceeded
either to spend the money already earned in the
Tchartchees and Bezesteens,<sup id="r052"><a href="#n052">52</a></sup> or to procure new
customers for my own shop, by boasting in the coffee-houses
and taverns of my influence in higher
quarters. Was Mavroyeni, on the contrary, only
expected to make a short absence, I contented myself
with taking a turn round the precincts of the
arsenal.</p>

<p>In one of these rambles I remember being shown
two highly esteemed productions of the pictorial art,
presented by the drogueman to the Pasha. They
were representations of two of Hassan's most memorable
achievements; the surprisal of the Russians
at Lemnos, and the bombardment of Daher at Acre.
In these chef-d'&oelig;uvres all was depicted with the

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

utmost faithfulness&mdash;the vessels, the batteries, the
guns, the very balls whizzing through the air, and
the shells falling on the buildings. One feature
alone was omitted in compliment to Turkish prejudices;
a mere trifle, no doubt, in the eyes of the
painter&mdash;the combatants themselves!&mdash;but this very
circumstance&mdash;as I told the Turkish officer my
<i>cicerone</i>&mdash;so far from lessening its value, was, in
my opinion, the most judicious thing I had ever beheld.
The great point in works of art, my language-master
at Chios had assured me, was only to bring
forward the leading objects, the essential supporters
of the action; and to discard all insignificant and
superfluous accessories. Now, what was it that in
engagements by land or by water did all the execution?
The men?&mdash;By no means! They only
stood aloof. It was the shells, the bullets, the grape-shot.
These therefore filled the whole foreground
more properly.</p>

<p>So much did the acuteness of this remark delight
the officer, that in his rapture, he clapped
his broad whiskers on my face, and swore I was the
only sensible Greek he ever had met with. It was
evident that he knew not a countryman of mine,
whom I found one morning in excessive wrath with
a Perote artist&mdash;a Frank,&mdash;for having painted him
a Madonna with such force of light and shade, as
absolutely to stand out from the canvas. He swore

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

it was a scandalous production;&mdash;almost as bad as
an image! and the poor artist could not even obtain
praise for his talent, much less, payment for his
labour.</p>

<p>I had been several weeks at Constantinople without
yet seeing my patron's lady. Not that, like
Turkish wives, she was kept secluded in a harem,<sup id="r053"><a href="#n053">53</a></sup>
but, on the contrary, because, in order to enjoy
greater freedom, she preferred spending her autumn
at a villa on the Bosphorus. One afternoon Mavroyeni
took me to Therapiah<sup id="r054"><a href="#n054">54</a></sup> in his ca&iuml;ck, and I was
there presented to the domina. She happened to
be sunning her plump charms on the quay. Nothing
could exceed the stateliness of her appearance; and
had she not been somewhat broader than she was
long, her carriage would have been very dignified.
Half a dozen surrounding attendants had no other
employment but to support her august person;
much too important to support itself on ordinary
occasions. One walked on before with a peacock-tail
fan, to keep the flies from her glossy face; and
another behind, to shake the dust off her still more
lustrous gown.</p>

<p>An untoward accident was fated to happen, just
as every thing seemed disposed to strike a new comer
with all possible awe and admiration. At the furthest
outlet of the channel, in the very middle of its silvery
expanse, and on the verge of the horizon, was

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

descried a dark speck that looked endowed with
motion. Rapidly the opaque body advanced, skimming
the fleecy surface of the waters; and, as it
approached, it increased in size and consequence.
Its wide extending fins dipped into the waves like
the pinions of the swallow, while its sharp and prominent
beak cut its way through the billows like
the shark or the sword-fish. All eyes were riveted
upon the threatening monster, and presently no one
but myself any longer remained in ignorance of its
nature. It stood confessed,&mdash;O horror!&mdash;not exactly
a dragon come to devour our princess on the
sea-shore, like another Andromeda, in order to give
me an opportunity of signalizing my gallantry as her
Perseus; but something full as savage, and much
more inglorious: the Bostandjee-bashee<sup id="r055"><a href="#n055">55</a></sup> in his police
boat, coming to nibble at the trains of the
Greek princesses, which exceeded the standard
of the Turkish sumptuary laws. At this terrific
sight, the arms of the six suivantes all dropped with
one accord by their sides, and with them dropped
to the ground their mistress's train. The snow-white
ermine swept the dust of the road; while its wearer&mdash;who
just before had appeared scarce able to move
without assistance&mdash;suddenly recovered the entire
use of her short legs, and waddled away by herself
as nimbly as any duck pursued by a kite, until the
friendly screen of a wall enabled her to stop, to
face about, and to take breath after the immense
exertion.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

<p>As soon as the terrified party had safely reached
the house, the fault of the precipitate retreat was laid
on an impending shower. I had the imprudence&mdash;fool
that I was&mdash;to run and search for a cloud. The
only one I could find was that gathering on the lady's
own brow; and my officiousness got me a look in
that quarter, which boded more storms than ever
lashed the Bosphorus in March.</p>

<p>What could the company do, in the uncertain
state of the sky, but collect round the tandoor?<sup id="r056"><a href="#n056">56</a></sup>&mdash;that
safe refuge against the winter's rigours, that
eastern nondescript, which in the angle of the
mitred sofa holds a middle character between the
table and the bed, and underneath whose gaudy coverlet
all the legs of the snug party coverge round
a pot of lighted charcoal, there to stew for the evening.
Like the rest, I crept under the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>This was my first admission to a gossiping party
of quality; and I must in justice to its members
confess that it yielded not to those of inferior rank.
In the course of an hour or two I heard a very reasonable
quantity of scandal. There was no recent
occurrence in church or state, army or navy, boards
or bed-chambers, the Bab-humayoon,<sup id="r057"><a href="#n057">57</a></sup> or the back
stairs, but was properly collected, combined, compared,
dissected, analyzed, and circulated. I now
for the first time learnt, to my infinite satisfaction,
both the precise offence of the last Visier beheaded,
and the precise length of the last feridjee<sup id="r058"><a href="#n058">58</a></sup> curtailed.
I was informed in the same breath, how the great

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

Morosi managed his principality, and how the little
Manolacki conducted his courtship; how the Patriarch
had quarrelled with the Archons,<sup id="r059"><a href="#n059">59</a></sup> and how the
Spatar<sup id="r060"><a href="#n060">60</a></sup> had beaten his wife; how the mortgages of
the church were redeeming, and how the slipper-money<sup id="r061"><a href="#n061">61</a></sup>
of the Sultanas was engaged: and I so
confidently heard it asserted by a gentleman on my
right, that the conference between a certain Ambassador
and the Re&iuml;s-effendee<sup id="r062"><a href="#n062">62</a></sup> would produce a new
war; and by a lady on my left, that the meeting
between a certain archimandrite and his ghostly
daughter would produce a new christening, that I
no longer doubted that the fumes of the brazier over
which we sat, must have all the oracular virtues
which issued from the cave of Delphi. On going to
bed I expected from them very surprising effects,
but to my disappointment I experienced none other
than a dream, in which I beheld the Sultan pounding
the Grand Mufti in a mortar,<sup id="r063"><a href="#n063">63</a></sup> and the pope of
Rome standing by, crying bravo!&mdash;"Bravo," echoed
I with all my might,&mdash;when my own voice waking
me just in good time, I got up to return with my
master to the capital.</p>

<p>"Well, Anastasius," said the drogueman to me,
as we were cleaving the waves of the Bosphorus,
"how do you like our Constantinople life?"</p>

<p>"Very much;" was the answer evidently expected,
but which I did not give,&mdash;feeling little edified with
my visit to Therapiah, where I had had my share

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

of the second-hand insolence, which the Fanariotes
take very quietly from the Turks, only to put it off
less quietly among the taooshans. "Not at all;"
was therefore the short reply I made.</p>

<p>The drogueman stared. I felt I had been too
laconic. "Were the rest of the Greeks I see here,"
added I, "at all like your highness, the place
would indeed be a paradise; but this capital seems to
change the nature of whatever it harbours; and my
countrymen, so gay, so light-hearted at Chios, seem
at the Fanar at once dull and important. Besides,
the difference made between Christians and Mohammedans
here is too great, too mortifying. The few
Moslemen of Chios mingle with its rayahs on a footing
of equality. They almost reckon it a favour to
be admitted to their junketings. But here, the very
noblest of the Greeks&mdash;your highness alone excepted&mdash;are
daily exposed to the insults of the
meanest Turk. Were it not for my principles, I
would rather be a Turkish porter than a Greek
prince."</p>

<p>Mavroyeni looked thoughtful. After a little
pause, "You mistake, Anastasius," replied he, "in
thinking the Greek of Constantinople different from
the Greek of Chios. Our nation is every where the
same. The same at Petersburg as at Cairo; the
same now that it was twenty centuries ago."</p>

<p>I stared in my turn.</p>

<p>"What I say," continued my master, "is perfectly

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

true. The complexion of the modern Greek
may receive a different cast from different surrounding
objects: the core still is the same as in the days
of Pericles. Credulity, versatility, and thirst of
distinctions from the earliest periods formed, still
form, and ever will continue to form, the basis of the
Greek character; and the dissimilarity in the external
appearance of the nation arises, not from any
radical change in its temper and disposition, but only
from the incidental variation in the means through
which the same propensities are to be gratified. The
ancient Greeks worshipped an hundred gods, the
modern Greeks adore as many saints. The ancient
Greeks believed in oracles and prodigies, in incantations
and spells; the modern Greeks have faith in
relics and miracles, in amulets and divinations. The
ancient Greeks brought rich offerings and gifts to
the shrines of their deities, for the purpose of obtaining
success in war and pre-eminence in peace; the
modern Greeks hang up dirty rags round the sanctuaries
of their saints, to shake off an ague or to
propitiate a mistress. The former were stanch patriots
at home, and subtle courtiers in Persia; the
latter defy the Turks in Mayno, and fawn upon
them at the Fanar. Besides, was not every commonwealth
of ancient Greece as much a prey to
cabals and factions as every community of modern
Greece? Does not every modern Greek preserve
the same desire for supremacy, the same readiness

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

to undermine by every means fair or foul his competitors,
which was displayed by his ancestors? Do
not the Turks of the present day resemble the Romans
of past ages in their respect for the ingenuity,
and, at the same time, in their contempt for the
character of their Greek subjects? And does the
Greek of the Fanar show the least inferiority to the
Greek of the Pir&aelig;us in quickness of perception, in
fluency of tongue, and in fondness for quibbles, for
disputation, and for sophistry?&mdash;Believe me, the
very difference between the Greeks of time past and
of the present day, arises only from their thorough
resemblance; from that equal pliability of temper,
and of faculties in both, which has ever made them
receive with equal readiness the impression of every
mould and the impulse of every agent. When
patriotism, public spirit, and pre-eminence in arts,
science, literature, and warfare, were the road to
distinction, the Greeks shone the first of patriots, of
heroes, of painters, of poets, and of philosophers.
Now that craft and subtlety, adulation and intrigue
are the only paths to greatness, these same Greeks
are&mdash;what you see them!"</p>

<p>To me it mattered little, whether the modern
Greeks resembled the ancient or not, as long as I
was not reckoned on a footing with my neighbours
the Fanariotes. I therefore paid Mavroyeni a compliment
on his oratory, and let the subject drop;
still muttering to myself, "Stambool was a detestable
place!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

<p>It remained not always so. The Fanariotes&mdash;whose
defect is not want of quicksightedness&mdash;soon
perceived that I was a great favourite with the favourite
of the favourite <i>par excellence:</i> and as no
ramifications of this genus, however minute, were to
be neglected, I began to enjoy my due share of adulation
and of consequence. Those who before were
deaf when I spoke to them, now addressed me the
first; and the identical joke which formerly left the
muscles of every face unmoved, now had the power
to set a whole table in a roar. With my situation
my manners underwent a total change. The rude
exterior of the islander had been exchanged among
the caleondjees<sup id="r064"><a href="#n064">64</a></sup> of the Capitan-Pasha, for a swaggering
braggadocio air. The martial strut was now
laid aside for the smooth simpering smile of the
courtier. Instead of spluttering out my unpolished
sentences by half dozens in a breath, as if I had
more words crammed in my throat than could issue
one by one from my mouth, I now practised with a
nonchalant air to drop only now and then a significant
monosyllable, so profound in its meaning that nobody
could get at it;&mdash;and as to the mother tongue,
the Roma&iuml;c<sup id="r065"><a href="#n065">65</a></sup> idiom, it was no longer to be used,
except interlarded with such scraps of French, Italian,
and Turkish, as to render it almost unintelligible
to the vulgar auditor. Athwart my borrowed
languor and effeminacy, however, the native vigour
and raciness of the soil would break forth occasionally

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

with such energetic bursts, as both astonished
and delighted the Fanariote fair. To them
my rough-cast homage presented an acceptable contrast
to the mawkish tenderness of their every-day
admirers. My freedom passed for na&iuml;vet&eacute;, my
neglect of forms evinced a flattering devotedness,
and my rustic exterior promised affections more
robust and lasting than could be expected from the
sickly natives of a large capital. Flattered by the
men, and smiled upon by the women, I now said to
myself&mdash;"Stambool is a charming place!"</p>

<p>So great, indeed, became in it my vogue, that,
had my fastidiousness been less, I might have adapted
my courtships, as our great men suit their pelisses,
to the different seasons of the year: for, while autumn
still continued to pour forth her golden treasures, a
grocer's fair spouse&mdash;herself the image of ripeness
and of plenty&mdash;offered to feed my good-will with figs
and raisins, to pay in comfits for the sweets of my
converse, and to support the ardour of my affections
with rosoglio and spice: when winter began to chill
the blood, the sleek helpmate of a furrier would fain
have dispelled my freezing coldness even at the expense
of all her husband's rarest ermines; and, when
returning spring enamelled every field with fresh
flowers, I beheld at my feet a whole bevy of beauties,
fresh as the violet and the daisy, and, to own the
truth, not much more exalted in the scale of human
flowerets:&mdash;but comfits were only lures for boys; ermine

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

had no charms, except as the garb of royalty;
and beauty itself lost its attractions in my eyes, when
destitute of rank and fashion.</p>

<p>The first lady possessed of these latter attributes
whom I found disposed to cast an eye of compassion
on my sufferings, was of the devout order, and the
very domina who had excited the oracular ingenuity
of one of the party, on my first visit to Therapiah.
The worthy archimandrite, to whom were entrusted
her spiritual concerns, had, on the application of her
husband, been exiled by the Patriarch to the holy
mountain,<sup id="r066"><a href="#n066">66</a></sup> in order to pursue his spiritual meditations
with less interruption. The lady, now finding
that even the long beard of a priest was unable to
screen her reputation, resolved to try whether the
beardless face of a boy would protect it.</p>

<p>A first success, obtained in a distinguished quarter
from real preference, leads to others granted by
vanity. But with my fashion increased my fastidiousness.
All could not catch that laid snares for
me; nor could all keep that caught me. My favour
was precarious, and&mdash;a little tyrant in love&mdash;I treated
the tender passion quite in the Turkish style.</p>

<p>Still I continued undistinguished, nay, unheeded,
by the proud Theophania. Not even by accident
could the looks of this lofty lady descend to my level.
She appeared unconscious that a being so insignificant
as myself existed, filled its portion of space, and
breathed the same air with her noble lungs. If she

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

wished to move from one part of the room to another,
and I happened to stand in her way, her
hand would mechanically push me aside, without
the participation of her mind, like a chair or a table;
while her averted eye was directed to some more
distant point of space. In vain might I lay myself
out for her approbation,&mdash;I could not even obtain
her satire. The very ridicule of Theophania would
have been too much notice for one so low as me.
It was positive condescension in her, one day when
in an humbler quarter I showed myself insatiate of
adulation, to turn round to me and with some impatience
to say, "it is the privilege of the great, sir,
to receive praise: the insignificant should be at the
trouble of praising themselves!"&mdash;So violent indeed
was her temper, and so sarcastic her conversation
with individuals of every rank and degree, that even
the most distinguished among the Fanariotes only
approached her with fear and trembling, and, as
soon as the indispensable rites of politeness had been
performed, hastened away, ere, like the drones in a
hive, they felt the sting of this intractable queen bee.
The shafts of Cupid she had usually turned aside
by her petulance; but the few times they happened
to draw blood, she had loved as others hate.</p>

<p>Undismayed by these difficulties, I swore she
should be at the feet of the taooshan whom she
vouchsafed not to suffer at her own, and thenceforward
bent the whole force of my genius toward attracting

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

her attention, and exciting her interest.
When therefore she, who at first had feared to disgrace
her pretty pouting lips with the mere sound
of my name, began to abuse my person and my
character with most loquacious virulence, I considered
my triumph as secure. "Theophania," cried
I,&mdash;though not yet loud enough to be heard by herself&mdash;"you
only pursue me with contemptuous
looks, to feast your eye on my person; and you only
load me with opprobrious epithets, to fix your mind
on my image!"</p>

<p>If at last&mdash;which love and discretion forbid my
ever boasting!&mdash;the prize rewarded my pains, yet
troublesome was its tenure. The Euxine passes not
more quickly from tranquillity to storms, than from
serenity to passion changed my tempestuous and
variable mistress. One moment, infatuated to perfect
forgetfulness of her pride and station, she would
clasp my knees in ecstacy, and, humbling herself
unto my very feet, glory in her debasement; the
next, choking with rage, she would suddenly start
up again, rail at her degradation, wonder what she
saw in me to admire, and charge me, on my life, to
disclose by what spell I had compelled her affections;
but again, after having heaped upon me every direst
execration which her fertile fancy could suggest, her
passion would take another turn, and, bursting into
a flood of tears, she would conjure me by all that
was most sacred, if I could not return her love, at

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

least to pity her agony, and assist in breaking the
charm I had wrought, by rendering myself purposedly
as hateful as possible.</p>

<p>What more could I do than I did? The only
thing she ever saw me coax were my own little
budding mustachios, whose education and growth
I watched over with the tenderness of an anxious
parent: the only thing she ever heard me praise,
were the qualities to which she had the least pretension;
self-command, endurance, meekness. The
preferences I felt in other quarters I freely owned;
and the consolations I found, when she banished me
her presence, I regularly enumerated. In my vulgar
exultation (for vulgar it was) I treated with the
familiarity of a clown, one who had been used to the
deference of a queen; and to all such as had formerly
suffered from Theophania's insolence, I boasted
of being their avenger. Yet, in spite of my conduct
her love lessened not; it only became more conspicuous;
it afforded a sneering public a richer treat;
and at mass every eye in the church seemed constantly
vibrating between the grated gallery above,
where Theophania sat with the other women, and
the part of the nave below where, by her express
desire, I took my station, in order that she might
see me during her devout prayers.</p>

<p>Let man make his confidential friend of no woman,
except such an one as he cannot possibly make his
mistress;&mdash;namely, his mother, his sister, or his

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

aunt. If she happen not to stand with him in any
of these forbidden degrees, be she ever so old, or
ugly, or infirm, she will end by feeling disappointed;
and will accuse her unsuspecting friend of both too
much and too little reserve.</p>

<p>A quiet demure looking woman&mdash;one of those persons
with whom one feels as much at ease the first
time of seeing them as with an old acquaintance&mdash;once
or twice so good-naturedly cautioned me against
the consequences, when on the point of imprudently
courting public censure, that I determined professedly
to open to her my whole heart and circumstances.
Why not? "She herself had renounced
all love engagements. They gave more trouble
than they were worth; and she infinitely preferred
to the feverish enjoyments of passion the calm
pleasures of friendship&mdash;that is, of stable male
friendship, which one could depend upon. A tenderer
intercourse she only contemplated in others,
at a distance, by way of amusement, and in order
to study human nature in its different varieties and
shades. As to female friendship, she held it in the
contempt it deserved." The looks of this good lady
had informed me that she perfectly knew all my
doings. Giving her my confidence, therefore, was
only binding her to discretion; and at first I saw
every reason to congratulate myself upon this determination.
The tone of my new friend with me
was that of a mother with her son; overflowing only

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

with parental tenderness. Her whole mind seemed
only bent upon keeping an unexperienced youth out
of difficulties. But I soon found that from her
appeals to my prudence, the company present was
always excepted. Incensed at this discovery, I spoke
in anger and was answered with asperity. We
parted, no more to meet in friendship;&mdash;but I continued
not the less to live in the remembrance of this
excellent person.</p>

<p>Theophania's husband held one of the highest
offices at the court of Moldavia. He was wont to
date his days of repose from those of my attentions
to his wife. He could have raised a statue to my
merits from sheer gratitude, were statues ever raised
in modern times from such an antiquated motive.
All he prayed for was the permission to keep his
eyes shut;&mdash;and this was precisely the only favour
which my little friend would not grant him. Qualified
for the task she undertook by my former confidence,
she kindly forced upon him such irrefragable
proofs of his wife's imprudence, as permitted him no
longer to be blind to her conduct.</p>

<p>I was so accustomed always to be the last in my
appointments with Theophania, that one day in the
verdant valley of Kiad-han&eacute;,<sup id="r067"><a href="#n067">67</a></sup> the favourite haunt
of the Cupids of Constantinople, I felt rather nettled
at finding myself, though much after my time,
the first at the place of rendezvous. Still I waited,
and waited on; until impatience began to fan my

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

languid flame, and Theophania's star began to mount.
Alas! while I was trying to cool my ardour by contemplating
the gurgling brook, in which the weeping
willow was lightly dipping its delicate spray, as
if striving to steal a last parting caress from the
stream that fled its embrace, little did I imagine
that the proud Theophania was jogging along in a
rumbling kotshi&mdash;screaming until she was able to
scream no longer&mdash;to the borders of the Black sea;
thence to be conveyed in an open boat&mdash;much too
sick with the motion even to scold&mdash;to the port of
Galatsch, where a stout mule waited to carry her,
bumping in a wicker basket, to the presence of her
loving husband! He gave her a tender embrace,
assured her she had a decided vocation for the
monastic life, and accordingly whisked her off the
next morning to the most secluded convent in the
province of Valachia; where, I understand, she has
continued ever since, fasting, praying, and scolding,
by turns. As soon as I heard of her adventure, I
failed not to thank my little friend for the great
service she had unintentionally rendered me.</p>

<p>My own day of retribution from the hands of my
master was approaching. Neither my affair with
Theophania, nor even, I believe, my daily neglect
of my official duties, was the cause of my disgrace.
It was the cloud, the fatal cloud, which I could not
see when the Bostandjee-bashee passed by Therapiah,

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

but which nothing could dispel from madame's
angered mind, except my dismission. Her husband
would have preferred to have kept me; but,
among the tongues he commanded, that of his loving
helpmate had never in the family been numbered.
He neither could stop it, nor yet had acquired the
facility of listening to its explosions, as to the softer
murmur of a mill. He therefore might rule in
great affairs abroad, but always ended by obeying
in little matters at home: content to save his credit
by pretending to do from choice what he did from
necessity.</p>

<p>One evening, after playing truant the whole day,
I went up to submit to the accustomed lecture.
Instead of blustering as usual, Mavroyeni asked
in the most placid tone imaginable the cause of my
long absence. I now gave myself up for lost beyond
redemption. It was precisely the tone which the
drogueman was wont to assume, when, fully resolved
to have no further dealings with the person
who had offended him, he deemed reproach an useless
waste of breath. Still I made out a little story,
to which Mavroyeni listened very patiently,&mdash;after
which, without further reply, but pointing to the
door, he desired me to walk out, and never to walk
in again.</p>

<p>I knew him too well to have the least hope of his
recalling a sentence uttered in this manner. My

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

only remaining solicitude, therefore, was to
dignified retreat. After a profound bow&mdash;of defiance
rather than of respect,&mdash;I strutted away, carrying
my head so high, that I knocked it against the
soffit of the door.</p>

<p>But in spite of my seeming indifference, I felt
injured, if not degraded; for, in surveying my conduct,
I only took into account the last drop that
rose above the brim; the rest was hid within the
vessel.</p>

<p>I need not observe that what to me appeared the
height of injustice, was deemed by the remainder
of the family only a tardy act of bare equity. Such
as it was, however, it caused great jubilation, and
in the twinkling of an eye, the whole Fanar was
informed of the secretary's disgrace:&mdash;only it was
ascribed to my having, with a pistol in one hand,
and a sword in the other, made such proposals to
madame la droguemane, as she could not possibly
listen to&mdash;from her husband's clerk.</p>

<p>Eaves-dropping never was among my fancies.
Nor was I fond enough of puzzles, to put together
broken sentences, which in general may be made to
bear any signification; but one's own name is a great
stumbling-block in the way of one's discretion: and
when, crossing a dark passage as I went out of the
house, I heard mine pronounced with great vehemence,
the sound acted like a talisman. It riveted
me to the spot. I stopped to hear my panegyric.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

<p>All I could collect, however, was only that most
abundantly hated, while in the fresh zeal of my
service I chose to perform more than was set down
for me, and to do better than others, I had since
retrieved my character in the family by mending my
ways, and neglecting my business. On that account
I now carried away a certain portion of good
will. The party present regretted my fall; but the
chief orator consoled himself by thinking me such
a daring and dexterous fellow, that, happen what
might, I was always sure to come down upon my
legs.</p>

<p>"Amen!" cried I, walking out; "I accept the
welcome omen!"</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="v1ch05">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the night was already far advanced, I went,
till the next morning, to one of those temples of
hospitality ever opened to the stranger who sues
for admission with a silver tongue. It was sheer
churlishness in me, no doubt, to defer for so many
hours affording my numerous friends the often
wished-for opportunity of testifying the sincerity of
their regard. As soon, however, as the sun had
risen high enough to shine upon its testimonials, I
determined no longer to delay their happiness. I
even resolved, in order that no one should complain
of being omitted, to begin my visits methodically
at one end of the Fanar, and not to leave off
till I had reached the other. In the course of this
experimental round I found the warmth of my
well-wishers precisely in an inverse ratio to their
means. The higher classes made it a matter of
conscience, not to receive a servant discarded by his
master. Those of a lower degree expressed their
willingness to continue my friends as long as I had
a piastre left; only reserving to themselves the privilege
of dropping me, the moment their poor assistance

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

became of real consequence. Nothing however
stopped me in my circuit, until I had knocked
at the last door in the district;&mdash;for I still bore in
mind the last words I had heard under my master's
roof, and wished to preserve an authentic record of
my obligations to each of my friends. When no
one remained to apply to I cast up the sum total,
and finding it a cipher, wished them all at the
devil, and crossed over to Galata.<sup id="r068"><a href="#n068">68</a></sup></p>

<p>I here got, for my money, a new set of cronies:&mdash;jolly
souls, who, not possessing a para<sup id="r069"><a href="#n069">69</a></sup> of their
own in the world, never inquired what others were
worth, but lived from hand to mouth, banished care,
and set melancholy at defiance. They initiated
me into a lower and more riotous species of intemperance
than the decorum of my former situation
had permitted. Every day we met in some of the
taverns of the neighbourhood, where my new friends
contributed their share of the entertainment in sallies
at the expense of my old ones&mdash;and I, in ready
cash. It was quite consoling, to hear how they
pitied the drogueman, for losing such a treasure as
myself; how they laughed at my wit even before I
spoke, and how they drank every instant to my
health, and the success of my schemes. No day
passed without a party of pleasure being proposed,
for the sole purpose of keeping up my spirits: and,
lest I should not be aware how entirely they all
joined in it for my sake, no one ever ventured to

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

inquire the cost. Indeed, so far from presuming to
offend my delicacy by requesting to share in the
expense, they thought it a proper compliment to my
liberality to borrow from me whatever money they
wanted. Not for the world would they give another
the preference!</p>

<p>As soon as my finances were exhausted, my companions
of course disappeared; not, however&mdash;to do
them justice&mdash;from choice, but from sheer necessity,
and because, having been entirely supported by me,
they now had to shift for themselves. When my
embarrassment became known, one person only came
forward to relieve me, and that a female too, and
one who had not much reason to be pleased with my
proceedings&mdash;the little grocer's wife, whose figs and
raisins I had disdained. Hearing an exaggerated
account of my distress, and thinking me absolutely
starving, she trundled away with all her pristine
affection still next her heart, and a large pot of
marmalade under each arm. These, and all else
her shop contained, she pressed me to dispose of.
Too proud to owe to charity what I could not earn
by love, I pointed to my dress, which had cost a
great deal, and was still, in its ruins, worth a few
sequins, and begged she would not urge me. "I
will not receive," cried I, "where I can make no
return; but when you thought I wanted bread, you
brought me conserve of roses; and if any fresh ones

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

ever strew my path, the deed shall be found recorded
in the very kernel of my heart!"</p>

<p>Without leaving the poor little woman time to
answer so flowery a speech, I ran off to the only one
of my dispersed associates whom I knew where to
find. I wanted his advice, and felt sure that he
would not refuse what even those who will give
nothing else often bestow with such readiness.</p>

<p>An ascent of about fifty steps brought me to his
exalted abode. Its tenant might truly be said to look
down upon the world. To him it was a journey to
descend to the level of his fellow-citizens; and he
therefore conformed but little to their hours. Just
at mid-day signor Vasili was awaking from his
night's repose. On entering his a&euml;rial apartment I
still found him sprawling on his couch,&mdash;stretching
one arm, putting one leg to the ground, rubbing
his eyes, and giving such a yawn that I thought he
would have swallowed at least half Constantinople,
spread out like a map before him. At my unlooked-for
visit he stared, shook himself as if to be
certain he was not dreaming, and disposed his ears
in silence to listen to my story.</p>

<p>"I came,"&mdash;I said,&mdash;"to ask how people lived,
who had not any ostensible means of subsistence?"
This feat Vasili had performed so long, that it never
struck him it could puzzle any body. He therefore
still continued some time staring at me in utter silence

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

as before, in order to collect his thoughts. At last,
jumping up in such a fury as almost to startle me,
he seized hold of my arm, and led me to the window.
The prospect from it extended over the immense
city of Stambool unto its utmost boundaries, and
showed the inside like a prodigious ant's nest, where,
far below the eye, myriads of little insects were bestirring
themselves, crossing and jostling each other
in every possible direction. I praised the view, said
it was undoubtedly delightful to the eye, but still I
could not see how it was to feed an empty stomach.
"It may teach how to fill it with something else
though," cried my friend Vasili,&mdash;now for the first
time breaking his portentous silence. "Of the thousands
you behold in those streets, on those quays,
in those boats, on the land, and on the water, scarce
one half knew this morning how to get a meal at
noon, and a place of rest at night; yet I will engage
that every blockhead of them by this time has
broken his fast, and will find a hole to sleep in!
Why therefore should you fail, but from possessing
too superior abilities? Only scare not away your
invention by your fears, and&mdash;depend upon it&mdash;some
means of livelihood will present themselves!
However, what leisure I can give to help such measures
forward, I shall willingly bestow."</p>

<p>So saying, Vasili thrust his hand in his pocket,
and hauled forth a heap of the smallest coin of the
realm. This treasure he poured on the sofa, and

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

divided into three equal parts. Then, laying his
finger on each in succession, "the first," said he,
"we shall drink together this morning, in order to
whet our invention; the next I reserve for my own
wants to-morrow; the third is yours, until you find
it particularly convenient to repay me. Your brain
will by that means have an entire holiday, before
you need call upon your wits for your livelihood;
and, when you are thus upon a par with myself, the
deuce is in it if you cannot do as well!"</p>

<p>I thanked my generous friend; but, just as we
sallied forth to fulfil the first article of this partition
treaty, he cast his eye upon my attire. It was no
longer the flowing robe of the Fanar<sup id="r070"><a href="#n070">70</a></sup>&mdash;the anteree
of state: I had exchanged that for the more dashing
short dress of my last intimates. A rich embroidery
covered the seams, and a costly velvet
formed the ground-work. "I am thinking," said
Vasili, "that your present wardrobe ill suits your
purpose. Who can fancy a purse, stiff with gold
outside, to be empty within? Supposing, therefore,
that on this occasion we give business precedence
over pleasure, and, reversing the dreams of the
alchymists, change gold into baser substances. We
may afterwards adjourn to a tavern, to drink success
to your metamorphosis. The showiest caterpillar,
you know, must become a chrysalis ere it can
soar a butterfly."</p>

<p>I could have dispensed with the chrysalis state:

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

for, though poor, I still liked to look well; but I
yielded to my friend's arguments, and hied with him
to Sultan-Bayezid<sup id="r071"><a href="#n071">71</a></sup> to change the outward man.
While we were looking for something suitable to
our purpose, in stepped a worthy Israelite, who
came like ourselves, not to sell, but to buy. A still
decent beneesh&mdash;but of a dusky hue&mdash;hidden under
a heap of gaudier dresses, seemed to catch his fancy;
which the salesman no sooner perceived than all the
powers of his oratory were summoned to extol the
article in question. He had better have been modest
about its merits. The jew&mdash;both by nature and by
cultivation an adept in the business&mdash;now put upon
his mettle, at once began to pour forth such a torrent
of profound observations on the art of old
clothes dealing, that the seller was glad at last to
give him the cloak for nothing, ere he let all the bystanders
into every deepest mystery of the trade.</p>

<p>In truth, it was diamond cutting diamond. The
Hebrew had himself professed, in the elegant quarter
of Hash-keui,<sup id="r072"><a href="#n072">72</a></sup> the noble trade of old clothesman,
till bankruptcy forced him to quit his district
and his business. Having early in life served an
&AElig;sculapius of his own nation, with whom he learnt
a few terms of medicine, he now resolved to turn
physician himself The thing was easy enough at
Constantinople, where a man need only stalk about
in a furred cap<sup id="r073"><a href="#n073">73</a></sup> and a dark-coloured gown, followed
by an attendant with a small square chest,

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

to have all the men hold out their wrists, and all
the women put out their tongues to him&mdash;in consultation.</p>

<p>The cap had already been provided. The beneesh
was immediately put on, and the very attendant
chosen <i>in petto</i>. For, to the hawk's eye of my Israelite,
my anxious look at once bespoke me the
very thing he wanted. Calling me aside, he made
the proposal without much ceremony. I was ostensibly
to be his servant, but, in reality, his partner.
Even that clause, however, could not sweeten the
nauseous draught. I felt so indignant at being proposed
to for an apothecary's apprentice, that, without
making any answer, I went and imparted the
impertinent offer to my friend Vasili. But in that
quarter I found little sympathy. "See," said he,
laughing, "how fortune throws herself in your way.
I wish you joy of your good luck." This speech I
was willing to take as a joke, but I found it to be
serious; and, more incensed than before, "Sooner,"
I cried, "if all other trades fail, would I, in one of
those coarse and dingy Lahse<sup id="r074"><a href="#n074">74</a></sup> jackets there, work
for my bread in the fields! The earth cannot degrade
its children, and no one requires a character
to plough the ground." "True," replied Vasili:
"but one may require a constitution, though; and
who in their senses, pray, would take such a spindle-shanked
fellow as you are just now, with a face as
pale as a turnip already, and an eye round which

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

"rake" is written in most legible black letters, to
dig his garden for him? Ere you had half done,
he would expect to have your own grave to dig!
For my part, I would try what requires neither
stock, nor capital, nor labour, nor even science, as I
take it, nor any thing but the impudence of which
you possess a sufficient stock; were it only for the
fun, and to see what no one but a physician ever
sees:&mdash;for, more potent even than gold, medicine
will open to you the deepest recesses of the harem;
and who can tell but, like our friend Lorenzo,<sup id="r075"><a href="#n075">75</a></sup> you
may feel Sultanas' pulses."</p>

<p>This was setting the masquerade in its most tempting
light. It tickled my fancy; and I struck the
bargain with the jew. He was to carry his own
Galen, in the shape of the best half of an old missal,
stolen from a capuchin; I undertook the medicine
chest, with all its pills of starch, and all its powders
of pipe-clay. The only thing I insisted upon as a
<i>sine qua non</i> in the treaty, was not to appear in my
new character in any of the streets I had before
frequented; and to this ultimatum the jew readily
enough agreed. Matters thus settled between us,
I somewhat dolefully exchanged my gaudy apparel
for a dress in unison with that of my principal, and,
after vainly begging in gratitude for my friend Vasili's
advice, to have the honour of making upon him
my first experiment in my new profession, walked
away with my grotesque patron.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

<p>Immediately we began stalking through all the
lanes and by-streets of the capital; I, with a pace
exactly regulated by that of my master, who walked
before me, and both of us turning our heads constantly
from right to left and from left to right, like
weathercocks, to watch every call from a door or
signal from a window; but full as much on the alert
to avoid old faces as to court the notice of new ones.
Now and then, when we had time for idle chat, I
used to advise Yacoob,&mdash;that was my principal's
name,&mdash;to provide himself with a proper license for
killing the Grand Signor's subjects, in the shape of
a diploma from the Hekim-bashee.<sup id="r076"><a href="#n076">76</a></sup> He denied not
the expediency of the measure, but he always found
some pretence for delaying the performance. At
first his poverty prevented the purchase; afterwards,
the pressure of business, and so long did we go on,
without any inconvenience from the neglect of the
said formality, that at last we began to think we
never should feel the want of it, and totally forgot
there was such a person as the Hekim-bashee.</p>

<p>Ours was an off-hand method of practice. As all
cases were pretty much alike in reference to our
skill, a single feel of the pulse generally decided the
most difficult treatments. Our patients&mdash;chiefly of
the industrious class&mdash;could not afford long illnesses,
and these we certainly prevented. What most annoyed
us was the headstrong obstinacy of some individuals,
who sometimes insisted that they still felt

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

disordered, when we positively assured them they
were cured. Had they been killed instead, they
would not have complained! Still more disagreeable
incidents occasionally occurred. Called in one day
to a woman in convulsions, Yacoob, I know not why,
prescribed a remedy which the Turks regard as an
insult. In her rage the woman flew at him, and bit
off half his ear. It was all I could do to save the
other half. Another day (a Mohammedan festival),
a set of merry-making Osmanlees insisted on Yacoob's
putting on an European dress, which they
carried about on a pole, that they might kick him
through the streets as a Frank; and though he
actually refused a fee for gratifying their whim, he
nevertheless was made to go through the whole
ceremony.</p>

<p>I remember a quieter, but more impressive scene.
One evening, as we were returning from the Blacquernes,<sup id="r077"><a href="#n077">77</a></sup>
an old woman threw herself in our way,
and taking hold of my master's garment, dragged
him almost by main force after her into a mean-looking
habitation just by, where lay on a couch,
apparently at the last gasp, a man of foreign features.
"I have brought a physician," said the female to the
patient, "who, perhaps, may relieve you." "Why
will you"&mdash;answered he faintly&mdash;"still persist to
feed idle hopes! I have lived an outcast: suffer me
at least to die in piece; nor disturb my last moments

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

by vain illusions. My soul pants to rejoin
the supreme Spirit; arrest not its flight: it would
only be delaying my eternal bliss!"</p>

<p>As the stranger spoke these words&mdash;which struck
even Yacoob sufficiently to make him suspend his
professional grimace&mdash;the last beams of the setting
sun darted across the casement of the window upon
his pale, yet swarthy features. Thus visited, he
seemed for a moment to revive. "I have always," said
he, "considered my fate as connected with the great
luminary that rules the creation. I have always
paid it due worship, and firmly believed I could not
breathe my last whilst its rays shone upon me.
Carry me therefore out, that I may take my last farewell
of the heavenly ruler of my earthly destinies!"</p>

<p>We all rushed forward to obey the mandate: but
the stairs being too narrow, the woman only opened
the window, and placed the dying man before it, so
as to enjoy the full view of the glorious orb, just in
the act of dropping beneath the horizon. He remained
a few moments in silent adoration; and
mechanically we all joined him in fixing our eyes on
the object of his worship. It set in all its splendor;
and when its golden disk had entirely disappeared,
we looked round at the Parsee. He too had sunk
into everlasting rest.</p>

<p>Our easy successes amongst the lower orders made
us by degrees aspire to higher patients. We took

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

to attending the poor gratis, in order to appear qualified
to try the constitutions of the rich; and, by
appearing to have respectable customers, we got
them. A Beglier-bey<sup id="r078"><a href="#n078">78</a></sup> of Roumili&mdash;the great-grandson
of a Sultan, on the mother's side (for, on the
father's, such filiations are stifled in the birth), was
passing through Constantinople. One of his Armenian
grooms chose to thank Yacoob for having been
relieved by nature from a troublesome quinsy, and
recommended him to his master's kehaya. The
kehaya also&mdash;in spite of Yacoob's attendance&mdash;got
the better of his rheumatism, and praised us to the
head eunuch. The head eunuch, left by us as we
found him, spoke of us in high terms to his master;
and the Visier, on being seized with an indigestion
for which he had laboured very hard, himself condescended
to send for us. He however determined
to have two strings to his bow, and to consult the
stars as well as the faculty: so that my master found
himself pitted against a moonedjim,<sup id="r079"><a href="#n079">79</a></sup> who recommended
an emetic, while Yacoob insisted on a contrary
remedy. The Visier, determined to be right,
slily took both, thinking thus to make the opposite
opinions meet. The medicines certainly did; and
by their conflict, kept us for a while in as violent a
perspiration as the Pasha himself. As however the
disorder only proceeded from too free an indulgence
of a good appetite, the double remedy, though a
little violent, in the end proved beneficial; and after

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

suffering a few sympathetic pangs, we ultimately
reaped both reputation and profit from our treatment
of this three-tailed patient.</p>

<p>Thus we were enabled to quit our itinerant mode
of life, and to set up near the Backtch&eacute;-capoossee<sup id="r080"><a href="#n080">80</a></sup>
a shop of decent appearance, furnished with jars and
phials of all sorts and sizes. These we inscribed
with the names of the most costly medicines, while
the inside bore witness to their rarity. Instead of
going in pursuit of patients, we now waited till they
came or sent. In the course of his practice my
principal had discovered that, if some ailments will
only obey a face furrowed with age, youth and
freshness best dispel certain others; and these he
left to my sole management.</p>

<p>Our Visier (he was ours, body and soul) had his
two regular wives&mdash;fixtures in the capital. But to
his home establishment he added a lighter travelling
equipage of half a dozen slaves, Circassians and
others. Among this latter troop, the stag-eyed
Fathm&eacute; shone like the full moon among the stars.
Besides her patron of eighty or thereabouts, this
fair one boasted two other equally strenuous admirers;
the black eunuch who guarded the harem,
and the old governess who kept its contents in
order. These two personages used to devote half
their time to the cares of their own persons, and the
other half to watching that of their rival. Both
having intrusted us with their health, each took an

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

opportunity of hinting how agreeable I might make
myself, by putting that of the other beyond the
reach of contingencies. It was a glorious hint!
Without going the whole length of the modest request,
I might contrive to keep signor Suleiman and
signora Zelidah confined to their beds, while I made
my inquiries after the health of their prisoners; but
unlooked-for incidents marred this bright scheme.</p>

<p>Disappointed at Yacoob's not being able to restore
him at fourscore to the vigour of forty, the Visier had,
unknown to his jew doctor, called in a new ally;&mdash;the
very person whose lynx-eye Yacoob dreaded
more than the spectacles of all the imperial moonedjims
put together, namely, the chief physician of
the Seraglio. Just as my master was coming in triumphantly
one morning to his patron, with a phial
of soap-suds and cinnamon which he swore would
renovate the last defunct Mufti himself, he unexpectedly
beheld the crabbed visage of the crusty
Triestene the very first thing on the threshold. Poor
Yacoob looked as if he had seen the Medusa in person!
He however had presence of mind enough left
to dash his phial to pieces, and then to be in despair
at the accident. It afforded him an opportunity of
making an immediate retreat, under the pretence of
running home to repair the grievous loss; but with
the full determination never more to go near the
Pasha's door. This availed him little. The old devil
of a Triestene&mdash;who at his exit had sent after him

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

the ugliest grin I ever beheld,&mdash;satisfied that we
practised unlawfully, denounced our doings to the
president of the killing college. The Visier,&mdash;the
more incensed at being duped, from the pleasure
he promised himself in bringing together two such
luminaries of the profession,&mdash;threw in his weight
against us, and the consequence was our being sentenced
to an exemplary punishment. As we sat
brooding over the misfortune of the Pasha's proving
less a fool than we thought, a posse of police myrmidons
invaded our shop, and summoned us to
prison. These gentlemen, however, as usual, began
their official functions by emptying all our phials and
gallipots into their capacious stomachs. This proceeding,
and its natural consequences, caused us a
short respite.</p>

<p>While our first guardians were engaged, a new
set was to be sent for: but these conveyed us without
further delay to the place of our confinement.
The very hour which I had destined for consoling
the fair Fathm&eacute; in her prison saw me ushered into
that of the Bagnio.<sup id="r081"><a href="#n081">81</a></sup></p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

<div class="center" id="v1ch06">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> vast and high enclosure of the Bagnio, situated
contiguously to the arsenal and the docks,
contains a little world of its own, but a world of
wailing. One part is tenanted by the prisoners
made on board the enemy's ships, who, with an iron
ring round their legs, await in this dismal repository
their transference on board the Turkish fleet. This
part may only be called a sort of purgatory. The
other is hell in perfection. It is the larger division,
filled with the natural subjects of the Grand Signor
whom their real or supposed misdemeanors have
brought to this abode of unavailing tears. Here are
confined alike the ragged beggar urged by famine
to steal a loaf, and the rich banker instigated by
avarice to deny a deposit; the bandit who uses open
violence, and the baker who employs false weights;
the land robber and the pirate of the seas, the assassin
and the cheat. Here, as in the infernal regions,
are mingled natives of every country&mdash;Turks,
Greeks, Armenians, Jews, and Gipsies; and are
confounded individuals of every creed&mdash;the Mohammedan,
the Christian, the Hebrew, and the Heathen.

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

Here the proud and the humble, the opulent and
the necessitous, are reduced to the direst of equalities,
the equality of torture. But I err: for should
some hapless victim&mdash;perhaps guilty of no other
crime but that of having excited the Sultan's cupidity&mdash;still
wear on his first entrance the livery of
better days, his more decent appearance will only
expose him to harsher treatment. Loaded with the
heaviest fetters, linked to the most loathsome of
malefactors, he is compelled to purchase every alleviation
of his burthen, every mitigation of his pain,
at the most exorbitant price; until the total exhaustion
of his slender store has acquired him the
privilege of being at least on a level with the lowest
of his fellow sufferers, and spared additional torments,
no longer lucrative to their inflicters.</p>

<p>Every day a capital fertile in crimes pours new
offenders into this dread receptacle; and its high
walls and deep recesses resound every instant with
imprecations and curses, uttered in all the various
idioms of the Othoman empire. Deep moans and
dismal yells leave not its frightful echoes a moment's
repose. From morning till night and from night
till morning, the ear is stunned with the clang of
chains, which the galley-slaves wear while confined
in their cells, and which they still drag about when
toiling at their tasks. Linked together two and two
for life, should they sink under their sufferings, they
still continue unsevered after death; and the man

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

doomed to live on, drags after him the corpse of his
dead companion. In no direction can the eye escape
the spectacle of atrocious punishments and of indescribable
agonies. Here perhaps you see a wretch
whose stiffened limbs refuse their office, stop suddenly
short in the midst of his labour, and, as if
already impassible, defy the stripes that lay open his
flesh, and wait in total immobility the last merciful
blow that is to end his misery; while, there, you
view his companion foaming with rage and madness,
turn against his own person his desperate hands,
tear his clotted hair, rend his bleeding bosom, and
strike his skull until it burst against the wall of his
dungeon.</p>

<p>A long unpunished pirate, a liberated galley-slave,
Achmet-re&iuml;s by name, was the fiend of hell who by
his ingenuity in contriving new tortures, and his infernal
delight in beholding new sufferings, had deserved
to become the chief inspector of this place,
and the chief minister of its terrors. His joys were
great, but they were not yet complete. Only permitted
thus far to exercise his craft on mortals, he
was still obliged to calculate what degree of agony
the human frame could bear, and to proportion his
inflictions to man's powers of suffering, lest, by
despatching his victims too soon, he should defeat
his own aim. He was not yet received among his
brother d&aelig;mons, in the blissful abodes where torments

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

do not kill, and where pangs may be increased
in an infinite ratio.</p>

<p>Of this truth the very hour of my arrival had afforded
him a sorely lamented proof! An Armenian
cashier, suspected of withholding from the Sultan&mdash;sole
heir to all his officers&mdash;the deposit of a deceased
Pasha, had just been delivered over into Achmet's
hands; and many were the days of bliss to which
the executioner looked forward in the diligent performance
of his office. On the very first application
of the rack, out of sheer malice, the Seraff
expired!</p>

<p>Two days later the whole of Achmet's prospects
of sublunary happiness were near coming to a close.
Some wretches, driven by his cruelty to a state of
madness, had sworn his destruction. Their hands,
tied behind their backs, could be of no use to them
in effecting their purpose:&mdash;they determined to crush
him with their bodies. All at the same instant fell
with their whole weight upon the executioner, or
upon their own companions already heaped upon the
monster, in hopes of burying his corpse under a
living tumulus. But Achmet's good star prevailed.
Ere yet his suffocation was completed soldiers rescued
the miscreant. He recovered, to wreak on his
disappointed enemies his fiercest vengeance. Their
punishment was dreadful! Sanguinary but not cruel,
prone to shed blood in anger, yet shuddering at torture,

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

I was horror-struck at the scene, and the yells
of the victims still ring in my ears.</p>

<p>Characters meet at large in the world, which may
almost count as sure their meeting again, some time
or other, within the narrow precincts of the Bagnio.
Of this species was the captain of the Maynote
pirates, who took our Venetian cutter. He now
occupied his winter quarters among the galley-slaves.
Though I had had but little time on our
first interview to cultivate his acquaintance, I could
not help remembering that from the moment his
tall commanding figure rose above the side of our
vessel, and stepped on board, my stars had assumed
a milder aspect, and my situation had been improved.
Each, therefore, was glad of the <i>rencontre;</i> each expressed
his sincere pleasure at meeting the other;
each politely hoped the other might be destined to
make a long sojourn in the place.</p>

<p>There are men so gifted, that in whatever situation
fate may place them, they still inspire a certain
awe and respect, and, though fallen through dint of
adverse circumstances into the most abject condition,
still retain over all around them an innate superiority.
Of this sort was Mackari. He had been one
of the chieftains of that small tribe of mountaineers,
pent up in the peninsula of Mayno, who like greater
nations claim dominion over the seas that gird their
native rocks. Mackari, therefore, had only considered
himself as acting conformably to his natural

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

right, in capturing the vessels that trespassed on
his domain without purchasing his permission; and
in his conduct he discerned neither injustice nor
treachery. Hence his lofty soul still preserved all
its dignity amid his fallen fortunes. Patient under
every insult, unruffled by the direst torture, he was
never heard to utter a sigh, to offer a remonstrance,
or to beg a mitigation of the agonies inflicted on
him. Even when his keepers, unable to wrest from
his scornful lip the smallest acknowledgment of
their ingenuity in torturing, began to doubt their
own powers, and&mdash;irritated, at his very forbearance&mdash;resolved
to conquer by a last and highest outrage
his immoveable firmness; when with weights and
pullies they forced down to the ground that countenance,
which, serene in the midst of suffering,
seemed only fit to face the heavens; when they
compelled him, whose mental independence defied
all their means of coercion, constantly to behold the
fetters that contracted his body, they only succeeded
to depress his earthly frame; they were not able to
lower his unbending spirit. Still calm, still serene
as before, he only smiled at the fresh chains with
which he was loaded; and at each new fetter added
to his former shackles, his mind only seemed to
take a loftier flight.</p>

<p>Yet, impassible as he appeared to his own woes,
was he most feelingly alive to those of his companions.
Of every new hardship with which they

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

were threatened, he uniformly stood forward to
court the preference; and while his fortitude awed
into silence the useless complaints of his troop, his
self-devotion still relieved its real misery. One day,
when a ferocious soldier was going to fell with his
club the comrade of Mackari's fetters, whom his
manacled hands could not save from the blow, he
opposed to the frightful weapon all he could command,
his arm; which, broken by the stroke, fell
by his side a wreck.</p>

<p>Thus did the Maynote captain's former crew still
view in their chief, though loaded with irons like
themselves, not only the master to whom they continued
to pay all the obedience they could show, but
the protector on whom they depended for all the
comfort they could receive. His very keepers were
unable in his sight to shake off the awe felt by all
who approached him. They confessed by their fears
their nothingness in his presence: they scarce could
derive a sufficient sense of security from all the fetters
which they had heaped upon their victim. In
vain would he himself with a bitter and disdainful
smile point to his forlorn state, and ask what they
apprehended from one on whom they might trample
with impunity? The mere sound of his voice seemed
to belie his words. It was the roar of a lion, dreaded
even through the bars of his cage. And when his
shackles were loosened in order that his daily labours
might begin; when Mackari was enabled to

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

raise for a moment his long depressed head; when
his majestic brow soared above the humbler height
of his tallest companions,&mdash;he looked like the cedar
of Lebanon, which, though scathed by the lightning
from heaven, still overtops all the trees of the forest;
and the wretches to whose care he was committed
used immediately to recede to a fearful distance.</p>

<p>Unendowed with any of the forbearance of the
Maynote chief, I had scarcely been an hour in the
Bagnio before I began to measure with my eye the
height of its walls, to consider the strength of its
gates, and to count the number of its guards. A good-natured
fellow-sufferer, who guessed my thoughts,
called me aside. "Take care what you do," whispered
he; "there is danger even in looking at these
walls. The mere suspicion of a plan to escape from
this place meets with the severest punishment; the
execution is impossible. Should you have succeeded
so far as to clear every impediment, every
barrier, every sentinel; should you have reached
the very heart of the city; should you in its seemingly
impenetrable vortex think yourself most secure
from any search, you have yet achieved nothing;
you have not advanced a single step toward your
liberation. Many inmates of the Bagnio, possessing
families in the city, enjoy unrestrained egress on the
express condition of bringing back the missing, or
of taking their place. The most active and watchful
of the spies they employ are stationed precisely

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

wherever the security from discovery seems the
greatest; and the sufferings of those whose attempts
at evasion have been baffled by their vigilance are
so cruelly aggravated, that a man must have lost all
hope of any other deliverance on this side the grave,
ere he attempt so desperate a mode of regaining his
freedom."</p>

<p>Not such was my case. As soon as, recovering
from my first dismay, I had begun to cast my eye
around, it had been arrested by a neat little spire
with a handsome gilded top, peeping over the battlements
of the western enclosure, and which somehow
struck me as an old acquaintance. No wonder that
it should! It crowned that very pavilion of the
arsenal where the drogueman held his office; where
sat Mavroyeni; where I myself had performed with
applause my first part on the stage of the capital.
An immediate gleam of hope beamed from its golden
ball, and glanced on my mind. "How!" thought
I, "Mavroyeni, my old master, shall spend all his
mornings within a stone's throw of the place in which
pines his Anastasius; shall only be impeded by
the thickness of a wall from seeing his hapless favourite;
shall almost in the midst of his business
hear the moans of his suffering servant, and, if applied
to, can he refuse to relieve me?&mdash;Impossible!
He needs only know where I am, and what miseries
I experience, to restore me, not perhaps to his pristine
favour, but to the common privilege of living,
or at least of dying, where I choose."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

<p>My only doubt was whether I should demean
myself so far as to implore his intercession. This
scruple, however, one of my satellites soon helped
me to get over by an opportune application of his
switch&mdash;only to keep his hand in practice&mdash;just as
I sat down in deep deliberation. Accordingly I adjured
the first fellow-prisoner who was liberated, by
all that he held sacred, to acquaint the drogueman
with my confinement, and to lay before him my petition.
I must confess that there was nothing the
good-natured creature did not promise in his joy to
do for me; but there I rather imagine his generosity
stopped. Though he had sworn that the sun should
not set before he spoke in my behalf, the sun set and
rose, and set and rose again, and nothing more was
heard of the fate of my request. I hereupon repeated
it to another person allowed to leave the
Bagnio, and after him to a third, and to a fourth;
but always with the same result. All professed
equal readiness to serve me, but all were either alike
forgetful of their promise or unsuccessful in their
application; for no notice was taken of me by Mavroyeni.
In vain I lingered day after day in feverish
expectation: in vain I questioned every new face
that appeared. No one knew any thing of my business;
no one had heard my name mentioned. At
last I became convinced that the drogueman was
determined to leave me to my fate, and resolved
to give up all further hopes of being freed, at least
by the hand of man. I say "by the hand of man;"&mdash;for

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

a higher power was beginning to manifest its
awful presence, which held out a prospect of speedy
release, not only to me, but to the whole Bagnio.</p>

<p>This was the plague.</p>

<p>The scourge had been expected for some time.
By several of the prisoners had the frightful hag, its
harbinger, been distinctly seen hovering with her
bat's wings over our drear abode, and with her
hooked talons numbering one by one her intended
but still unsuspecting victims. In the silence of the
night she had been heard leisurely calling them by
their names, knocking at their several doors, and
marking with livid spots the damp walls of their
cells.<sup id="r082"><a href="#n082">82</a></sup></p>

<p>Nothing but the visitation of this destructive
monster seemed wanting to complete the horrors
which surrounded me:&mdash;for if even, when only
stalking forth among men free to fly from its approach
and to shrink from its contact, the gaunt
spectre mows down whole nations like the ripe corn
in the field, it may be imagined what havoc ensues
when it is permitted to burst forth from the inmost
bowels of hell, in the midst of wretches close-wedged
in their dungeons or linked together at their tasks,
whom it must trample down to the last, ere it can
find a vent in space. It is there that&mdash;with a focus
of infection ready formed, a train of miasma ready
laid on every side&mdash;though this prime minister of
death strike at random, it never misses its aim, and

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

its progress outstrips the quickness of lightning or
of thought. It is there that even those who thus
far retain full possession of health, already calculate
the hours they still may live; that those who to-day
drag to their last abode their lifeless companions,
to-morrow are laid beside them; and that those
who are dying, make themselves pillows of the
bodies not yet cold of those already dead. It is
there that we may behold the grim destroyer in
one place awaited in gloomy silence, in another
encountered with fell imprecations, here implored
with anxious cries, there welcomed with eager
thanks, and now perhaps received with convulsive
laughter and mockery, by such as, trying to drink
away its terrors, totter on the brink of the grave
from drunkenness as well as from disease.</p>

<p>The before busy beehive of the Bagnio, therefore,
soon became a dreadful solitude. Its spacious
inclosures, so lately teeming with tenants of every
description, now began to present a void still more
frightful than its former fulness. Universal silence
pervaded those endless galleries, but a few days
before re-echoing with the confused din of thousands
of prisoners, fighting for an inch of ground on which
to lay their aching heads; and nothing any longer
appeared that wore a human shape, except here and
there some livid skeleton, which, as if again cast up
by the grave, slowly crept along the clammy walls.
When however the dire disease had devoured all

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

that could offer food to its voracity, it gradually fell
like the flame which has consumed its fuel; and at
last became extinct. What few miserable remains
of the former population of the Bagnio had escaped
its fury, were again restored to the regular sufferings
of the place, suspended during the utmost height of
the desolation.</p>

<p>I was among these scanty relics. I who, indifferent
to life, had never stooped to avoid the shafts
of death, even when they flew thickest around me,
had more than once laid my finger on the livid wound
they inflicted, had probed it as it festered, I yet
remained unhurt: for sometimes the plague is a
magnanimous enemy, and, while it seldom spares
the pusillanimous victim, whose blood running cold
ere it is tainted, lacks the energy necessary to repel
the infection when at hand, it will pass him by who
dares its utmost fury, and advances undaunted to
meet its raised dart.</p>

<p>Not that my old master Yacoob can be quoted as
another instance in point. He too escaped indeed:
but it was from any thing but excess of courage.
Probably the plague thought his former campaigns
in her cause as an old clothesman, should not be forgotten
in his later acts of hostility as a physician.
Little trusting, however, to the generosity of his old
ally, who might consider the obligation fully repaid
by the ample stock of goods she had occasionally procured
him, his mind had, during the progress of the

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

disease, brought forth nothing but plans of evasion.
Each later device indeed miscarried, as all the former
contrivances had done before it; but this was
only to give birth to some plan still later and more
preposterous. One day, astride on the lofty summit
of the outer wall which surrounds the prison, he
had nearly given his enfeebled guardians the slip,
by softly letting himself down upon a heap of rubbish
thrown up outside as if on purpose to break
his fall, when, most unluckily espied, he was hauled
down to receive a hundred lashes on the soles of his
feet, for the nimble use he had made of them.
This castigation, if inflicted, must have ended his
troubles. Fortunately he had laboured before under
a suspicion of madness; and so violent a paroxysm
of raving now suddenly seized him, that some of
the bystanders began to think an hospital fitter for
his residence than a prison. The sacredness of
insanity saved his skin. The keepers durst not execute
the sentence passed upon him; and Achmet,
to whom a treat in his own way was since the
ravages of the plague become quite a rarity, walked
off sorely disappointed, and devoutly praying God
to deliver the Bagnio from all such madmen!</p>

<p>Yacoob's contrivances to be released from his confinement
did not end here. He had got by heart
all the prayers of the Mohammedans, and secretly
made himself perfect in all the accompanying gestures.
One morning, after he had attracted the eye

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

of a Turkish visitor of some distinction, he suddenly
fell on his face, crying: "he saw the prophet, and
was not only bidden by him to embrace Islamism,<sup id="r083"><a href="#n083">83</a></sup>
but actually instructed how to perform its rites;"&mdash;of
which indeed he forthwith acquitted himself with
great dexterity. The bait took with the stranger;
but the farce was laughed at by the familiars of
the place, who told Yacoob he might go to the
mosque if he chose, but reminded him that there
was one in the Bagnio. This damped his religious
ardour, and the vision sneaked off, as visions do.
Still did he from time to time repeat his grimaces;
and he was always observed to invoke Allah most
lustily when a stranger came in sight. It was curious
to see the holy violence with which on these
occasions he went through his namaz,<sup id="r084"><a href="#n084">84</a></sup> until large
drops of perspiration trickled down his greasy face.
No disappointments had power to stop these pious
but unavailing exercises.</p>

<p>He and I herded little together. The ordinary
companion of my toil was a young Greek, nearly of
my own age, but, from his less elevated stature, his
rounder features, and his more delicate complexion,
seemingly three or four years younger. His dress,
though at the time rather the worse for wear, preserved
an appearance of something beyond mere
neatness, or even costliness: it had a sort of studied,
and what would be called in Christendom theatrical
elegance. His gait and manners corresponded.

They too wore, not an air of quality, but a species
of <i>recherche</i> carried beyond natural grace. This
artificial exterior, this refinement of appearance,
were the more remarkable from the simplicity of
mind, the singleness of heart, on which they seemed
superstructed. The varnish penetrated not beyond
the surface. Yet there it adhered pertinaciously,
and amidst sentiments of the sincerest piety, Anagnosti
never fell upon his knees to say his prayers,
without an air, and never rose from his devotions,
without a grace. He himself, when aware of these
superfluous ornaments, blushed, and would have
given all he possessed to shake them off: but they
clung to him in his own despite. Sometimes I
used to rally him on a semblance of affectation so
little suited to our abode, and so discordant with
his real character. "Is it my fault?" cried he
one day. "If the plant has so long been trained
to formal symmetry, can the utmost neglect itself
immediately recall its primitive ease and wildness?
The subject, as you may have observed, is one
which I think of reluctantly, and hitherto have
avoided with care: but your good nature assures
me of your pity. Hear my story, and judge."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father," continued Anagnosti, "was pro&euml;sti<sup id="r085"><a href="#n085">85</a></sup>
of Stavro: Phonea gave birth to my revered mother. . . . . . . ."</p>

<p>"No doubt," cried I, interrupting him, "all the
world knows those two important places; but fancy
me very ignorant, and tell me where they lie?"</p>

<p>"Near Corinth," answered the youth, somewhat
surprised, and resumed his tale.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of Phonea,"&mdash;said he,&mdash;"justly
boast of their proficiency in the mysteries of divination.
This art formed my mother's principal portion.
Unfortunately her skill made her foresee
every calamity, but it found a cure for none; and
she spent her life in bewailing her sorrowful endowments.
Those of my father were of a different cast.
They consisted not so much in doubling present
evils by the fear of future mischiefs, as in making
the best of the ills under which we unavoidably
laboured. When therefore one evening a troop of
Arnaoots&mdash;in order to pay themselves for the unwelcome
protection they had afforded us against
the Russians&mdash;plundered our house, made fire-wood
of our olive-trees, and turned out our cattle into

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

our vineyards, my much respected father observed
how fortunate was this misfortune, as we possessed
at Salonica a rich relation who would do better for
us than we could do for ourselves&mdash;unless, as my
mother added with a shake of the head, he should
be dead or ruined.</p>

<p>"This kinsman we determined to seek out. Leaving
our patrimony at the mercy of the waywode,
as an acknowledgment for his trouble in selling
us to the robbers, we bade adieu to our native land&mdash;which
never had looked more lovely than it did
at that moment&mdash;and set out upon our journey.
My father trusted for our travelling expenses to
the charity with which he was sure Providence
would inspire every mortal we met, while my mother
trembled lest we should only meet banditti.
If any thing could move the hardest heart, it certainly
was our procession. Imagine, first, a man
already in years, loaded with the scanty wrecks of
his property; next, a woman, pale, emaciated and
borne down by illness, with a baby at the breast,
and leading another by the hand, hardly able to follow;
while myself, between two little girls, one of
ten and one of twelve, in a most tattered condition,
brought up the rear. We did not beg, for we knew
not the way; but we looked wretchedness itself:
and sometimes we found relief, and to those that
bestowed it, we gave in return all we had to give,&mdash;our
blessing. As however we advanced on the

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

journey, we began to need less assistance. This
my mother had said would happen, and she herself
was the one that accomplished her prediction.
Sinking under her grief she turned out of the path,
sat down upon a stone, and urged us to proceed&mdash;for
she could go no further. I threw my arms
round her neck, tried to cheer her, and sobbed.
'O my Anagnosti;' said she, as she pressed my
little fingers within her clammy hand, and fixed
on my countenance her anxious boding look,&mdash;'O
my curly-headed boy! remember your poor mother's
last words: let others fear their foes; you, my
sweet innocent, beware only of your friends!' Then,
in convulsive agony, she clasped me to her breast,
laid down her head, and died.</p>

<p>"Much as my mother's weakness had retarded
our progress, her decease was the only event in which
my father could not at first see any advantage. Long
he wept for his loss, and at last, assisted by us all,
he dug a grave by the road-side. In it was buried
my poor mother,&mdash;all but this lock of hair, which
shall only return to dust with her child.</p>

<p>"Just as we again set forward from the dismal
spot, the baby, which had long been pining, expired
for want of sustenance. We would not divide in
death what in life had thus far still been as one;
and turning back, deposited the child in the lap of
its parent:&mdash;they sleep together!</p>

<p>"My father now observed, 'it was better for my

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

mother to be dead than to suffer; and my little
brother was provided for.' Still he never ceased
to weep until we arrived at Volo. A lady of that
place, who had lost an only child, took such a fancy
to my rosy face that she begged to have it. Her
nauseous kisses had stamped it hers already! After
my mother's, could I bear them? My father too
was but indifferently inclined to part with his Anagnosti&mdash;the
only one of his children who in all his
looks and sayings reminded him of his Zo&euml;: but he
was poor, he thought that his loss would be my advantage,
and he only proceeded on with the other
three. I stayed, to cry and to be kissed.</p>

<p>"At Salonica my father found that his affluent
relation had died a bankrupt, as my mother had
foretold. 'This,' he observed, 'must make him return
to the labours of the field, which after all were
the healthiest.' Alas! in the damp deleterious
country to whose climate he was unaccustomed,
they carried him off. It was what my mother knew
would happen. In a quarrel between my father and
his waywode, she had heard the spiteful wretch wish
his worthier neighbour a seven years' ague.<sup id="r086"><a href="#n086">86</a></sup> The
disease only took seven months to bring him to the
grave; and this he thought a great mercy. While
ill too, he remembered that one day in the fields, on
suddenly turning round, he had seen his fellow-labourers,
jealous of a stranger, stamp on his shadow.
How could he after that be expected to live?

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

At the last gasp, his eye lit up at the thoughts of
rejoining his Zo&euml;!&mdash;and his poor Anagnosti, he was
sure, would not long stay behind. Charitable persons
took in the other little orphans: I sent them
the few pence I had collected: but alas, my little
hoard was lost by the way!</p>

<p>"My own good fortune lasted not. The old lady
at Volo who had promised to adopt me, changed her
fondness into aversion when she found how dearly
I loved to play in puddles, and how little I liked to
be kissed. She scolded me for being a boy; and
sighed to think what a tidy little girl she might have
had in my place, who never for an instant would
have quitted her side. The first of these faults I
acknowledged, and observed that she might have
been aware of it before; and as for the other
grievance, I told her 'if I could not always stay by
her side, I could do the next best thing, which was
never to go near her again.' She made no reply,
and I ran away.</p>

<p>"As I had always promised the Holy Virgin
faithfully to divide with her whatever I might earn,
I made no doubt that she would direct me well in
my search for a livelihood. I cannot think she did;
though it might be for my good. She made me engage
on board a Hydriote<sup id="r087"><a href="#n087">87</a></sup> laden with corn for the
Black sea. A single family formed the crew, from
the captain down to the lowest cabin-boy. But to
that family poor Anagnosti belonged not; and when

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

all the rest of the sailors used in a calm to dance on
the deck, I alone was left out to listen to their mirth
in the hold. Alas, I have since had dancing enough!
At the time, however, I thought the hardship so great,
that on my knees I begged the captain to let me too
have my share of dancing, and to flog me afterwards
as much as he pleased. Had he granted my petition,
I might not have had leisure to discover, as I did,
how ill a sailor's task suited my abilities, or agreed
with my duty to the Panagia. I therefore resolved
to abandon my amphibious life. The moment we
touched at Constantinople I took to my heels, not
doubting to find an easy subsistence in a place where,
as I had heard, the streets were paved with silver,
and the houses roofed with gold. For two long days I
waded knee-deep in mire&mdash;sleeping at night among
the cinders of the public baths, and waking in the
morning without a morsel of bread to break my fast.
So great became my hunger, that, at a sudden turn
which brought me opposite a cook-shop near the
Tophana,<sup id="r088"><a href="#n088">88</a></sup> the sight of a plate of kiebabs<sup id="r089"><a href="#n089">89</a></sup> hot from
the oven almost bereft me of my senses. Not daring
to approach, I involuntarily fell on my knees, and
half worshipped the dear hissing cutlets at a respectful
distance. An ill-looking fellow saw the action,
and guessing the motive, told me, 'if I was hungry,
to come along with him:&mdash;I should not want for
bread, as he was a baker.' He wanted a shop-boy;
and hard as it might seem for the son of pro&euml;sti of

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

Stavro to sell rolls at Constantinople, my stomach
audibly groaned the words: 'necessity had no law!'</p>

<p>"My apprenticeship was short. The very second
day of my ministry, after a flying visit from a Turk,
my master came up to me, and said 'he liked me so
well that he had determined immediately to give me
a share in the business; and I had nothing to do&mdash;
whoever might call&mdash;but to say that the concern was
my own.' On this my principal ran out, leaving me
in astonishment at my speedy promotion.</p>

<p>"A person did call, and I did say that the concern
was my own: but as that person was the Stambool
Effendee,<sup id="r090"><a href="#n090">90</a></sup> who had set apart that day for
weighing the weights and for measuring the measures
of the different tradesmen, the deficiency he
found in ours made him&mdash;though very condescending
and familiar at first&mdash;end by ordering that I
should be dealt by as I dealt by my loaves; namely,
baked in my own oven. In this consisted the chief
advantage I was to derive from the partnership.</p>

<p>"My cries of 'aman'<sup id="r091"><a href="#n091">91</a></sup> at this intemperate sentence,
brought out the whole neighbourhood. It
well knew my master's character, vouched for mine
without knowing it, and through dint of strenuous
intercession moved the Effendee to such excess of
lenity, as, in regard for my innocence, only to order
me three dozen strokes on the soles of my feet.</p>

<p>"The change, undoubtedly, was to my advantage:
yet did I feel so angry that I swore rather to go

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

without bread all the days of my life, than ever again
to trust to a baker. Lame as I was I tried to hobble
away. An odd-looking man, who had been
eyeing me all along from head to foot, asked me
whether I loved dancing. The question seemed insulting;
but, lest I should commit myself, I neither
answered yes nor no. 'You have been ill-used'&mdash;added
he&mdash;'My compassionate heart moves me to
take you home, there to cure your bruises.' I fancied
not the man's countenance, but my feet told me
not to mind his face, and I saw the less of it as he
took me on his back. While riding along I conceived
very sinister forebodings; but when set down
where we stopped I smiled at my fears. Nothing
could look less terrific than the place of my destination.
Around the walls hung suspended by elegant
cords and tassels, lutes, cymbals, guitars, and other
musical instruments, beautifully inlaid with mother
of pearl. The richest dresses were airing at the
windows, and if the habitation resembled any one
thing more than another, it was a temple of mirth.
In fact, when, restored by wholesome applications
both outward and inward, I asked what return I
could make for so much hospitality? the answer was,
'to dance.'</p>

<p>"I immediately began capering. But this was
not the thing meant. My host&mdash;a Greek of Scyra&mdash;had
in his youth been a dancer by profession. Age
having stiffened his joints, he now gained his livelihood

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

by giving suppleness to younger limbs. He
had a number of boys whom he trained to perform
ballets in the conacks or palaces of the great. His
eye had been caught by my nimbleness when about
to be put into the oven, and he roused my ambition
by pledging himself to make me a first-rate dancer.</p>

<p>"The greatest natural genius still requires cultivation.
For a while I toiled beyond all belief. But
as I never attempted a difficult step without addressing
the Panagia, I succeeded at last. I may
say without vanity that I acquired the perfection of
the art. The exactness of my poise, the precision
of my movements, the apparent ease with which I
performed the most difficult steps, were pronounced
positively sublime. From the ends of my fingers to
the tip of my toes, all was expression. The best
connoisseurs declared that in me alone they had
found the poetry of the heel; and my very shadow
was lighter than other people's shadows. But I do
not wish to praise myself!</p>

<p>"That I became celebrated, I need not tell. Every
other dancer was voted execrable. Whenever I appeared,
I was stunned with applause before I moved
a step; and the spectators were entranced at my
performance of what in others would have been
hissed: for it was not always that I exerted my best
abilities. With indifferent judges I would scarcely
stir; and even with the best I sometimes had my
bad days, when all the coaxing in the world could

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

not draw out my powers. I once felt so ill in reality,
that another dancer was sent out in my clothes, who,
accomplishing with evident effort what I performed
with ease, made the blockheads declare that I never
yet had danced so well as I did that evening.</p>

<p>"My emoluments kept pace with my celebrity.
At each pause in my exhibitions my forehead used
to be studded with gold coins,<sup id="r092"><a href="#n092">92</a></sup> and at the conclusion
of the performance, heaps of sequins showered
from all sides into my spangled cap. Who then
could have fancied me otherwise than happy? But
it is one thing to divert others, and it is another to
taste of joy one's self! The constant fatigue, the
sense of dependence, the fear of not succeeding, the
liability to the humours of a capricious audience,
the danger of losing the attraction of novelty, the
chance of being eclipsed by some abler competitor,
are alone dreadful drawbacks on a profession like
mine. Yet with me they were minor evils. Keener
sufferings peculiar to myself assailed me, and that
in general by preference just when my situation
seemed most enviable: for it was almost always
in the intoxication and flurry of spirits produced by
the exertions I made, by the bravos I excited, and
by the crowds of people, the glare of lights, and the
din of instruments I moved among, that the image
of my deceased mother, as she appeared in her last
moments, would rise with most distinctness to my
heated fancy. And often have I between the several

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

acts of the entertainment, retired to some lonely
corner to weep at liberty, while the whole assembly
seemed in ecstacies of pleasure. It is true that if
dancing produced melancholy, melancholy more than
once in its turn produced dancing. Sometimes, in
the sort of phrensy brought on by the clang of a
full band, I have started up, and, like the Mewlewi
derwishes,<sup id="r093"><a href="#n093">93</a></sup> have reeled round a room full of people,
until, completely exhausted, I fell senseless on the
floor.</p>

<p>"To add to the discomforts of my situation, I was
not even allowed to retain the hard-earned fruits of
my labour. Of the gold which I gained by the sweat
of my brow not a para remained my own, except
what in the evening, when I crossed the cemetery of
Galata, I had the address to slip into a hollow tree
or to drop behind a mouldering tombstone, where
the crows often were the first to find my little store.
The moment I got home from our nightly exhibition
I was regularly searched, and every farthing found
about me went into my master's pocket, as his pay
for my board, lodging, and maintenance. Enraged
at his illiberality I one evening threw my gilt jacket
in his face, saying, I wished to keep nothing that
was his, but would go and exercise my talent, naked
as I stood, on my own account. Hereupon the vampire&mdash;the
odious blood-sucker&mdash;brought against me
such a bill for bestowing that talent of which he said
I wanted to rob him, as must have left me all my

<!-- vol 1 page 136 -->

life a mere drudge&mdash;a puppet moving at his nod,&mdash;had
I not determined to settle the account in my
own way.</p>

<p>"In fact, now clearly discerning the whole drift
of the hospitality which the Scyrote had so kindly
afforded me, I henceforth watched my opportunity
to slip away from the ballet-master at Galata, as I
had done from the lady at Volo, the Hydriote captain,
and the fraudulent baker. This was not an
easy matter. Our manager was vigilance personified,
and never allowed me to go out of his sight.
An accident befriended me. One of my companions
had long cherished the greatest envy of my superiority.
In a <i>pas-de-deux</i> which we performed together
as a lover and his mistress, he kicked my
shins; I boxed his ears; he retorted by breaking on
my head the guitar with which he was serenading me,
and scratching my face in such a manner that the
next time the troop went out, I was left at home as
unfit to be seen. Whatever might ail my head, my
heels were in good order; I took to them as usual,
and never stopped till I had reached the quarter
most remote from where the Scyrote lived.</p>

<p>"Here I might dance on my own account as
much as I pleased, but found nobody to dance to
except the lowest rabble. In retiring out of my
master's latitude I had outstepped my own vantage-ground.
From exhibiting in palaces to assemblies
of the great, amid showers of gold, I was reduced to

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

toil in taverns for the amusement of ruffians, who
thought a few paras a very liberal reward, after
perhaps mortifying my pride into the bargain, by
invidious comparisons with some arrant posture-maker.
Obliged to lower the tone of my performance
to the standard of my new patrons, I lost all that
finish and delicacy of movement for which my
dancing had been celebrated, and dwindled into little
better than a tumbler.</p>

<p>"Nor was this all. One night, after drudging to
amuse a set of brutes, I met with such ill treatment
from the Bacchantes their companions, as to make
me expect with my poor lyre the end of Orpheus.
Thank God! the Panagia&mdash;knowing how observant
I always had been of her festivals&mdash;protected me
even against her own sex, and my poor life was
saved, little worth as it was. This signal escape led
me to serious reflections.</p>

<p>"I had always been punctual in my prayers, both
before dancing and after; and had as yet committed
no very heinous sin, save once on a fast-day eating
some nice yaoort,<sup id="r094"><a href="#n094">94</a></sup> which a Turk gave me after a
long performance; but I did not know what worse
might happen in my daily intercourse with infidels;
and I determined to avoid the danger by quitting a
profession, which, if distinguished, is also dangerous,
and full of hazard to one's faith and morals.</p>

<p>"Alas! it was too late to execute my good intentions!
My special admirers, brought in contact

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

at a tavern with the professed supporters of a rival
dancer, the two factions came to a pitched battle, in
which a life or two were lost, while I&mdash;the innocent
cause of the disturbance&mdash;was taken up by the patrole,
and thrown into this place of wretchedness; more
than ever convinced of the truth of all my honoured
mother's predictions:&mdash;for what were the old lady
of Volo, who washed her hands of me when I would
kiss her no longer; the Hydriote captain, who would
not let me dance with my messmates, after giving
me shelter on board his ship; the baker who first
fed, and next slily destined me to a snug corner in
his oven; the Scyrote, who cured, who entertained,
and afterwards robbed me of all my lawful gains;
and the caleondjees, who went about my zealous
champions, in order to get me almost torn to pieces
limb by limb, and locked up in the Bagnio&mdash;but so
many persons, at first all professing themselves my
stanch and trusty friends! and such is the horror
with which that word now inspires me, that, were I
to hear the Panagia herself say she was my friend,
great as hitherto has been the holy lady's goodness,
I should expect her to end by playing me some
scurvy trick!"</p>

<p>Here ended my companion's tale&mdash;the faithful
picture of his mind, in which moral rectitude and
affection were strangely combined with conceit, credulity
and bigotry. In the wide range of social
intercourse this odd mixture might not perhaps

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

have taken much hold on my harder compound;
nor should I greatly have coveted an intimacy with
the character of a stage-dancer grafted on a peasant;
but in the narrow precincts of the Bagnio
fastidiousness wears out, and constant propinquity
produced different sentiments; and the more, as
athwart Anagnosti's apparent facility of temper and
tenderness of heart there broke forth a sort of determined
sturdiness on certain points, which all the
laxity of his education and companions had never
removed, and which, inclined as one might be to
smile at his studied exterior, induced a sort of
respect for the stuff within. Insensibly, therefore,
an attachment grew between us, which, though it
daily increased, gave my companion no alarm, until
one day I remarked how great an alleviation our
misery had derived from our friendship. At this
unguarded speech Anagnosti turned pale. "Friendship!"
repeated he; "Say not so! It will again
bring me ill fortune. Like the rest of my friends,
you will ultimately be my bane."</p>

<p>"Words," answered I, laughing, "cannot alter
the nature of things. We certainly at this moment
are friends, and warm ones too: for I believe each
would willingly lay down his life for the other;
and even if the dangers of friendship should now
make us resolve to become bitter enemies, it would
already be too late:&mdash;already would the present

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

evil fail to insure redemption from the future one!&mdash;The
mischief is done; the spell is upon you."</p>

<p>"Then," said Anagnosti, after ruminating a little,
"if we cannot be less than friends, let us be more!
Let us become brothers; let religion sanctify our intimacy,
so as to divest it of its dangers;"&mdash;and upon
this he proposed to me the solemn ceremony,<sup id="r095"><a href="#n095">95</a></sup> which,
in our church, unites two friends of either sex in the
face of the altar by solemn vows, gives them the
endearing appellation of brothers or sisters, and imposes
upon them the sacred obligation to stand by
each other in life and in death.</p>

<p>Anagnosti, though he certainly had in his different
avocations run away full as often as he had
stood his ground, and had derived from his last
mode of life a certain outward tinge of effeminacy,
yet in reality was as brave as affectionate. He
had more than once resisted his guardians most
manfully in their unjust behests; he had even defended
his new friend at the risk of his life:&mdash;for,
one day that, disabled by illness, I lay at the mercy
of every aggressor, he had wrested from a fellow
slave the dagger levelled at my breast for the sake
of the worn-out capote on my back; and from
his disposition there was every reason to expect
that the fruits and the burthens of our alliance
would ever be equally shared. The first day therefore
that we could obtain the permission, we went

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

to a priest in the Bagnio, and desired the holy man,
after the short service which our straitened means
permitted, to accomplish the indissoluble union. At
first the venerable papas treated the request as a
jest. "The practice," he said, "was quite obsolete,
except among the most barbarous clans of the
remotest provinces. Epirotes, and other savages
who like them lived in eternal strife, might indeed
still retain such old customs,<sup id="r096"><a href="#n096">96</a></sup> but the people at
Constantinople were sufficiently employed in minding
their own concerns, without gratuitously engaging
to risk their lives for others." This remonstrance
producing no effect, the priest warned us more earnestly
to consider the consequences, before we irrevocably
bound ourselves by so serious an engagement.
Still we insisted, and he at last complied.
He enveloped us in the sacred veil, symbol of the
holy ties we contracted; and made us swear on our
knees, in the face of Heaven, to share together like
brothers, while we breathed, both good and adverse
fortune.</p>

<p>The solemn vow pronounced, and Heaven fervently
implored to bless it, we again rose. I shook
Anagnosti by the hand, and could not refrain from
saying, "though now brothers, still friends as
before."</p>

<p>He involuntarily shuddered. All his fears recurred;
and on casting off the sacred zone, we
found on it a fresh stain of blood. How it came

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

there neither of us could guess. Both searched for
the cause: none could be discovered; and we at
last forgot the evil omen.</p>

<p>The very period which saw our intimacy indissolubly
riveted, was fated to be that of our separation.
Whether at the time of my imprisonment
the length of my detention had been fixed; or whether
(as I afterwards suspected) Mavroyeni, while
apparently rejecting my application, in reality had
procured my deliverance,&mdash;one morning, when I
least expected my freedom, I was bidden to quit
the Bagnio. I say "bidden;" for, thinking the
thing optional, I at first, in conformity with my sacred
engagement, refused to accept the boon offered,
unless shared by my friend. But I now found myself
as little allowed to stay in, as I had before been
to stay out of the Bagnio, at my pleasure. I must
resume my liberty whether I chose or not, and was
very near being driven by force out of prison,&mdash;a
somewhat unusual circumstance! Anagnosti tried
to sweeten the bitterness of my release, by observing
that it might be rendered instrumental in
procuring his own. "Remember," said he, "that
in losing you, I lose all. O Anastasius, O my&mdash;<i>friend!</i>
remember," . . . . .</p>

<p>Here his sobs interrupted his speech, and the
guards, tired of our tedious leave-taking, tore us
asunder. After proceeding on a few yards, I turned
round to cast one more last look after my companion:

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

but already the gates had been shut behind
me; and I went forth&mdash;shaking off indeed
the dust of my prison, and with all Constantinople
open before me,&mdash;but without a single particle of
that rapturous joy of heart, which I always fancied
must crown the hour of my liberation.</p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> enjoy liberty one must live, and to live one
must eat, and I had not a para in the world to purchase
me a meal. In this embarrassing situation I
thought of my old patron. If he really had procured
my freedom, it was proper to thank him; if
not, it still was wise to do so. In the first case, he
might be induced by my sense of past kindness to
seek still greater claims to my future gratitude,&mdash;since
benefactors often resemble gamblers, who
double their stakes rather than lose the benefit of a
first throw; and in the latter case, the thanks I gave
for imaginary services would make the drogueman
wish to deserve them by real obligations. Gratitude
I had often found most productive when it preceded
the benefit. Besides, I had my friend Anagnosti to
intercede for; and I was desirous to strike the iron
while it was hot.</p>

<p>Most willingly would I have smartened myself
up a little for the visit. Not only a tattered appearance
smooths the way but indifferently athwart
the out-post of pampered domestics, who guard
the approaches of the great man's citadel; it often

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

makes the master himself ashamed of his petitioner.
The rich are ever ready to accuse the poor of wanting
proper respect, when they offend the fastidious
eye of pride by the display of their wretchedness.
The utmost I could do, however, was to arrange
my rags gracefully; and&mdash;repeating to myself, as I
strutted along, that a man's innate dignity of mien
and manners were a sufficient passport even to the
presence of a king&mdash;I boldly went to the Fanar,
and with the least possible tremor knocked at Mavroyeni's
door.</p>

<p>It certainly opened at my summons, but not to let
me enter. The porter who answered, holding it
cautiously ajar, contrived to fill the whole aperture
with his own person, until he had most leisurely
surveyed mine. While thus examined, I recognised
in my surveyor an old acquaintance. So it seems
he did in me; for when I asked to see his master,
he banged the door in my face, without a syllable of
reply. It was just what I myself had done a dozen
times, when with Mavroyeni at Argos. The uncouthness
of the janitor's reception, therefore, I
thought, must originate higher. Servants behaved
not thus, unless they felt their conduct sanctioned
by their masters: for dependents know the antipathies
of their patrons by instinct. "Hie thee hence,
therefore, Anastasius," exclaimed I; "thou hast
no longer any business near this threshold:" and
hereupon I walked away.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

<p>At that instant the same door burst open again,
and almost flew off its hinges. I looked back. It
was to let out Mavroyeni himself. Convinced that
an attempt to accost him would only expose me to
fresh mortifications, I now felt as solicitous to avoid
his eye as I had been before to be admitted to his
presence. Hastily drawing back my head, I passed
on, or rather, ran away, as if it had been an ignominy
even to be seen near the drogueman's abode.</p>

<p>Heated with my race, I rushed into the first coffee-house
on my way, and observing a large bowl of
hoshab<sup id="r097"><a href="#n097">97</a></sup> most invitingly set out on the counter,
greedily lifted it to my lips, and gulped down the
icy beverage. I had no earthly means of payment;
but heaven came to my assistance. Exhausted with
inanition, I felt too weak to resist the sudden chill:
it struck me to the heart. I reeled backwards, and
fell senseless on the floor.</p>

<p>How long the fit lasted I am unable to tell. All
I know is, that when my senses returned I found
myself in a smart jog trot, bumping at the back of a
hamal, and travelling in this inconvenient posture at
the rate of a league an hour, up one dirty lane and
down another;&mdash;but whither, was beyond my power
to guess.</p>

<p>I therefore made free to ask the question, and
was but little pleased with the information obtained.
Convicted in the shop by my sudden seizure of a
confirmed plague, the master had only felt desirous

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

to get rid as soon as possible of so unwelcome a
customer, and had called in the porter aforesaid, to
convey me to the hospital. Thither I was speeding
as fast as another man's legs could carry my person:
for even during the above account my bearer
slackened not his pace, but kept jogging on as
lustily as before.</p>

<p>I took the liberty of representing that there was a
mistake in the case. However weak and exhausted,
I was totally free from any infectious disorder.
"Nothing more likely," answered the hamal; "but
he was paid for the job, and must earn his fare;"
and upon this he only grasped me somewhat tighter
than he had done before, for fear that being less ill
than he had imagined, I might contrive more easily
to give him the slip. In vain I insisted upon being
let loose, and excused from going where, if I brought
not the plague, I was sure to find it. My expostulations
were of no avail; and I therefore tried to
liberate myself by pummelling my vehicle with all
my might:&mdash;but the feeble impression of my unnerved
fist on the tough hide of my obstinate beast,
instead of making him throw me off, only served to
quicken his pace.</p>

<p>I now resorted to the last means of salvation in
my power, fixed my claws in the brawny throat of
the miscreant, and squeezed him almost to suffocation.
Finding his load became too troublesome, he
at last let me slip down from his back to the ground,

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

swore I was the most refractory piece of goods he
ever had carried, and left me, in order to seek elsewhere
an easier fare.</p>

<p>One street appeared to me as good as another to
die in:&mdash;and my present sensations foreboded nothing
else. I crawled to a stepping-stone near the
place where I had been deposited, and on that pillow
resigned myself to my fate.</p>

<p>So near in fact seemed my exit, that a novelist
writing my history would have availed himself of
the circumstance happily to terminate his first volume,
and to leave me irretrievably for dead in the
opinion of his reader, until my unexpected resurrection
at the beginning of volume the second.
Writing in the first person, I cannot keep my friends
in this state of agreeable suspense, or conceal from
them one single moment that I lived on: but it was
for some time in such wretchedness, as would not
even leave the most fastidious critic any pretence to
find fault with the proceeding. One man passed by
me, and another, and another, and several stopped
and looked; but, when their curiosity was satisfied,
all went on again, only shrugging up their shoulders.
No one of my own sex offered me the least
assistance. At last came two females. For several
minutes ere they reached my resting-place, their incessant
loquacity had warned me of their approach;
but I was too ill to look up, and had closed my eyes.
"Bless me," said the one, "I see something alive

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

there!" "Bless me," said the other, "and so do
I!" "A man!" cried the first. "A handsome
youth I declare!" cried the second. "Unwell,"
rejoined the little one: "Dying, I fear," resumed
the tall one. "How like Anastasius!" exclaimed
the former. "Himself, as I live!" replied the
latter. "Then, indeed," continued the other, in a
sagacious whisper, "I am very much afraid, neighbour,
that he is not dying, but only dead drunk."&mdash;Enviable
effects of a good name!</p>

<p>My character was now to me a matter of life
and death. "No," said I, therefore&mdash;making an
effort to speak, but in a scarce audible voice;&mdash;"it
is not drunkenness that oppresses me: it is suffering&mdash;it
is starvation."</p>

<p>At this speech, the women both scream out in
astonishment; both talk at the same time. They
want to know the how, the when, the where. "Torment
me not with questions," cried I; "but if you
have any humanity, get me conveyed to St. Demetrius.<sup id="r098"><a href="#n098">98</a></sup>
Pay the five piastres required for my admission;
and expect not to be repaid in this world."
Saying this, I again fainted away.</p>

<p>The first perception which followed this second
fit, was that of an entirely new change of objects.
The women had succeeded in their humane endeavours,
and I was lying under a filthy coverlet,
on a filthy pallet, in the filthy hospital in question,
next to a dead man, whose pulse the would-be

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

physician of the place was just in the act of feeling,&mdash;assuring
some bystanders that it was perfectly
quiet, and no longer showed any symptom of
fever.</p>

<p>I shall not finish the picture of the disgusting
abode, where nevertheless I had been introduced
only out of sheer humanity. Suffice it to say that
under its truly hospitable roof every nuisance found
a home, medicine alone excepted. A scanty charity
was the chief support of the institution, and an unwieldy
governor the chief object supported. Yet,
after a fair contest between my constitution and my
pleurisy, in which neither side received the least assistance
from doubtful prescriptions, the former got
the better. The father of nine helpless orphans
expired by my side, and I recovered.</p>

<p>It was during my convalescence that I most forcibly
felt all the wretchedness of my receptacle: it
was during my convalescence, also, that I most fully
owned my unworthiness of a better. "But," cried
I, tossing about on my hard couch, "the deadliest
poisons compose the most salutiferous medicines, and
the direst calamities produce the best resolves. It
will be my own fault if I rise not from this bed of
sickness and suffering, both wiser and worthier!"
Thus I spoke while my pulse still beat low, and my
passions were still weak.</p>

<p>At last came the day which I fancied would never
come&mdash;that of my release from the hospital. It

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

dawned about a month after I had entered the dismal
place. I sallied forth at mid-day; and indescribable
was the rapture with which I first again
breathed a pure air, and beheld the whole expanse
of an azure sky.</p>

<p>Still was I as much as ever at a loss how to subsist.
Absorbed in this weighty consideration I
slowly walked down the hill of St. Demetrius, when
I fancied I discerned at a distance a caravan of travellers,
who, with a slow and steady pace were advancing
towards Pera, the residence of the Franks
at Constantinople. I mechanically quickened my
steps, in order to survey the procession more closely.</p>

<p>First in the order of march came a clumsy calash,
stowed as full as it could hold of wondering travellers;
next came a heavy araba,<sup id="r099"><a href="#n099">99</a></sup> loaded with as
many trunks, portmanteaus, parcels, and packages,
as it could well carry; and lastly led up the rear a
grim-looking Tartar,<sup id="r100"><a href="#n100">100</a></sup> keeping order among half a
dozen Frank servants of every description, jogging
heavily along on their worn-out jades. At this sight
the droguemanic blood began to speak within me.
"These are strangers, Anastasius," it whispered:
"be thou their interpreter, and thy livelihood is secured."
I obeyed the inward voice as an inspiration
from heaven, and, after smartening myself up a
little, approached the first carriage.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Pera, excellencies!" said I, with a
profound bow, to the party within. At these words
up started two gaunt figures in nightcaps, with

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

spectacles on their noses, and German pipes in their
mouths&mdash;whose respective corners still kept mechanically
puffing whiffs of smoke at each other. The
first action which followed was to lay their hands on
the blunderbusses hung round the carriage; but,
seeing me alone, on foot, and to all appearance not
very formidable, they seemed after some consultation
to think they might venture not to fire, and only
kept staring at me in profound silence. I therefore
repeated my salute in a more articulate manner, and
again said, "welcome, excellencies, to Pera, where
you are most anxiously expected. As you will probably
want a skilful interpreter, give me leave to recommend
a most unexceptionable person&mdash;I mean
myself. Respectable references, I know, are indispensable
in a place where every one is on the watch
to impose upon the unwary traveller; but such I
think I can name. As to what character they may
give me; <i>that</i>,"&mdash;added I with a modest bow,&mdash;"<i>that </i>
it would ill become your humble servant himself
to enlarge upon."</p>

<p>At so Christian-like a speech, uttered in the very
heart of Turkey, the travellers grinned from ear to
ear with delight. It produced another short consultation;
after which the two chiefs cried out in
chorus: "<i>Oui chai pesoin;</i>" and bade me mount
by their side. This enabled me, after a little compliment
on Germany their birthplace, and on their
proficiency in the French idiom, immediately to enter
upon the duties of my office&mdash;for which I thought

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

myself sufficiently qualified, by the squibs which I
had heard the drogueman of the Porte, Morosi, let
off, in company with my patron, at the diplomatic
corps of Pera.</p>

<p>"This edifice," said I, pointing to the first building
of note in the suburb which we met in our way,
"is the palace of the Ich-oglans&mdash;the Sultan's pages.
It is the most fruitful seminary of favourites, of Pashas,
and of Sultanas' husbands.<sup id="r101"><a href="#n101">101</a></sup>
In that direction lives that most respectable of characters the Imperial
internuncio<sup id="r102"><a href="#n102">102</a></sup>&mdash;the baron Herbert; who, with all
the shrewdness of a thorough-paced minister, combines
all the playful simplicity of a child. Further
on dwells the French ambassador Monsieur de Choiseul-Gouffier&mdash;a
very great man in little things;
and opposite him lives his antagonist in taste, politics
and country, the English envoy sir Robert
Ainslie&mdash;of whom the world maintains exactly the
reverse. Quite at the bottom of the street, likewise
facing each other, live the envoys of Russia and of
Sweden.<sup id="r103"><a href="#n103">103</a></sup> The former I feel bound to respect, whatever
be his merit; the latter really possesses much.
He is an Armenian, who writes in French a history
of Turkey. He has lately made with his bookseller
an exchange profitable to both,&mdash;he having given
his manuscript, and the other his daughter: that is
to say, the Armenian a single voluminous work,
and the Frenchman a brief epitome of his whole
shop. Wedged in between the palaces of Spain and

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

Portugal is that of the Dutch ambassador, whose
name, Vandendiddem-totgelder,<sup id="r104"><a href="#n104">104</a></sup> is almost too long
for these short autumn days; and whose head is
thought to be almost as long as his name: inasmuch
as he regularly receives, twice a week, the Leyden
gazette; which renders him beyond all controversy
the best informed of the whole Christian <i>Corps Diplomatique</i>,
with regard to Turkish politics. You
see, gentlemen, the representatives of all the potentates
of Christendom, from Petersburgh to Lisbon,
and from Stockholm to Naples, are here penned
up together in this single narrow street, where they
have the advantage of living as far as possible from
the Turks among whom they come to reside, and
of watching all day long the motions of their own
colleagues, from their most distant journeys to the
sublime Porte, to their most ordinary visits to the
recesses of their gardens."</p>

<p>These little specimens of my <i>savoir-dire</i> seemed
to please my German friends. They immediately
noted them down in their huge memorandum books,
which, no more than their short pipes, were ever
left an instant unemployed. Scarce had the party
stepped into the inn which I was allowed to recommend,
when they engaged me for the whole fortnight
which they meant to devote to the survey of the
Turkish capital.</p>

<p>My travellers were of the true inquisitive sort.
Every body used to fly at their approach; a circumstance

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

highly favourable to my interest. Under the
notion of always applying for information at the
fountain-head, they would stop the surliest Turk
they met, to ask why Moslemen locked up their
women. One day they begged the Imperial minister,
at his own table, to tell them confidentially
whether Austria was to be trusted. They were very
solicitous to know from the Russian envoy the number
of Catherine's lovers; and they pressed hard for
an audience of the Kislar Aga,<sup id="r105"><a href="#n105">105</a></sup> only to inquire
whence came the best black eunuchs. Had they
been in company with the Grand Mufti, they certainly
would have asked his honest opinion of the
mission of Mohammed; and they would scarce have
neglected the opportunity, had it offered, of inquiring
of the Sultan himself, whether he was legitimate
heir to the Califate, as he asserted. In consequence
of this straight-forward system I was every
moment obliged to interfere, and to pledge myself
for the guiltless intentions of our travellers. The
statistics of the empire, its government, politics,
finances, &amp;c. they indeed troubled themselves little
about. All such things they thought might be learnt
much more compendiously at home from the Leipsic
gazetteer; but the botany and mineralogy of the
country were what they studied both with body and
soul. Every day we brought home from our excursions
such heaps of what the ignorant chose to call
hay and stones, that the wags whom we met on our

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

way used to ask whether these were for food and
lodging; while the more fanatical among the Turks
swore we carried away patterns of the country, in
order to sell it to the infidels; and one party, by
way of giving us enough of what we wanted, was
near stoning us to death. Hereupon, to elude
observation, my cunning travellers determined to
dress after the country fashion: but this only made
bad worse; for they wore their new garb so awkwardly,
that the natives began to think they put
it on in mockery, and were frequently near stripping
them to the skin; independent of which, whenever
they went out, they got so entangled in their shaksheers
and trowsers, their shawls and their papooshes,
that our progress might be traced by the mere relics
of their habiliments which strewed the road. Sole
manager both of the home and foreign department,
I however tried to give all possible respectability to
their appearance, and never would suffer their dignity
to be committed by paltry savings; at the
same time, that, to show them how careful I was of
their money, I took care sometimes to detain them
an hour or two in driving a close bargain about a
few paras,&mdash;especially when I saw them in a hurry.
Accordingly, if they had any fault to find with me,
it was for my over-scrupulous economy. That
failing alone excepted they thought me a treasure;
and so I certainly found them.</p>

<p>The fortnight of their intended stay having elapsed,

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

they were all impatience to depart. Out of pure
regard for science I contrived to prolong their sojourn
another fortnight, by various little delays,
which with a little industry I brought about in the
most natural way imaginable, but which I joined
them in lamenting exceedingly: and when at last
they set off&mdash;which I saw with very sincere regret&mdash;I
was left by them in possession of a most flattering
written testimonial of my zeal and fidelity. As to
their behaviour to me, its liberality might be sufficiently
inferred from the change in my appearance.
This first experiment gave me a taste for the tergiumanic
life. It also increased my means of success
in that department. Till I took up my residence
at Pera, I had little intercourse with that odd
race of people yclept Franks, except through the
stray specimens that now and then crossed the harbour,
on a visit of curiosity or business to Constantinople.
I now got acquainted with their ways,
while they became familiarised with my person.
This gradually procured me the advantage of seeing
and serving, in my new capacity, samples of almost
every nation of Europe. Thus I formed a sort of
polyglot collection of certificates of my own ability
and merits, which I filed very neatly on a red tape
according the order of their dates, and to a sight of
which I treated every new comer whom I thought
worthy of that distinction.</p>

<p>Once, however, the lofty manner and the imperious

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

tone of an English traveller, newly arrived,
completely deceived me. From his fastidiousness I
made no doubt I was addressing some great My-lordo:
it was a button-maker to whom I had the
honour of bowing. He came red hot from a place
called Birmingham, to show the Turks samples of
his manufacture. Unfortunately Turks wear no
buttons, at least such as he dealt in; at which discovery
he felt exceedingly wroth. My ill fated back
was destined to feel the first brunt of his ill humour.
After spending nearly two hours in spelling
every word of every one of my certificates&mdash;"this
then," said he in a scarce intelligible idiom, which
he fancied to be French, "is the evidence of your
deserts?" "It is," answered I, with an inclination
of the head. "And I am to make it the rule of my
behaviour?" "If your excellency be pleased to
have that goodness," replied I, smirking most agreeably.
"Very well," resumed the traitor, never
moving a muscle of his insipid countenance, "My
excellency will have that goodness." And up he
gets, gravely walks&mdash;without uttering another syllable&mdash;to
the door, turns the key in the lock, takes
a little bit of a pistol scarce five inches long&mdash;also
from Birmingham, I suppose&mdash;out of his pocket,
snatches up a cudgel as thick as my wrist, and turning
short upon me, who stood wondering in what
this strange prelude was to end, holds the pistol to
my throat, and lays the cane across my back.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

<p>This operation performed to his satisfaction:
"It was No. 5," coolly said the miscreant, "whose
contents I thought it right to comply with first; as
being written by one of my countrymen, and because
I make it a rule, in every species of business,
to get the worst part over first. Had you understood
our language&mdash;as an interpreter by profession
ought&mdash;you might have known the certificate in
question to be a solemn adjuration to all the writer's
countrymen, to treat you as I have had the pleasure
of doing; and all that remains for you to perform
is to give me a regular receipt, such as I may have
to show."</p>

<p>The pistol was still tickling my throat, I, jammed
up against the wall, and the button-maker six
feet high, and as strong as a horse. All therefore I
could do in the way of heroism would have been to
have let him blow out my brains at once;&mdash;after
which, adieu my turn, at least here below! I therefore
signed, had the satisfaction of seeing the receipt
neatly folded up and deposited in a little red morocco
pocket-book with silver clasps, was offered
a sequin for the exercise I had afforded, took the
money, and, leaving the button-maker to write
home what mean rascals the Greeks were, departed
fully impressed with the usefulness of learning languages.</p>

<p>Almost every evening the man of buttons used to
walk from Pera, where he had his lodgings, to a

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

merchant's at Galata, from whence he frequently
returned home pretty late at night, without any
escort,&mdash;trusting to his small pocket instrument,
and to his own colossal stature, for his safety. A
dexterous thrust, at an unexpected turn, might
easily have sent him to the shades below; but this
would not have sufficed to assuage my thirst for
just revenge. I wished to inflict a shame more
deep, more lasting than my own, and which, like
Prometheus's vulture, should keep gnawing the
traitor's heart while he lived. His great ambition
at Constantinople was to boast the good graces of
some Turkish female&mdash;young or old, fair or ugly,
no matter! On this laudable wish I founded my
scheme.</p>

<p>Muffled up in the feridjee which conceals the
figure of the Mohammedan fair, and the veil which
covers their faces, I went and seated myself immediately
after dusk, on one of the tombstones of
the extensive cemetery of Galata, where my traveller
had to pass.</p>

<p>He soon arrived, and, as I expected, stopped to
survey the lonely fair one, whose appearance seemed
to invite a comforter. The bait took. My friend,
on his nearer approach, aware that his pantomime
was more intelligible than his idiom, had recourse
to the universal language: he held up a sequin,&mdash;and
on the strength of this gift becomes more enterprising.
Profane hands are laid on my veil. I

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

resist:&mdash;but by way of compromise for keeping
concealed my features, I show my necklace, my
bracelets, my girdle. In an infantine manner I slip
the manacles from my own wrists over those of my
amorous shepherd, and, before his suspicions are
aroused, have the satisfaction to see him fast bound
in chains, not only of airy love, but of good solid
brass; and with a soft lisp wish him joy of being at
once handcuffed and pinioned. It was now I showed
my face, and drew out my handjar.<sup id="r106"><a href="#n106">106</a></sup> Perceiving
an inclination to remonstrate, "No noise," cried I,
"or you die; but return me the receipt." Unable
to stir, my prisoner in a surly tone bade me take it
myself. I did so, and thanked him; "but," added
I, "as we have not here&mdash;as with you&mdash;all the conveniences
for writing, accept the acknowledgment
of the poor and illiterate:" saying which, I drew the
holy mark of the cross after the Greek form, neatly
but indelibly, with the button-maker's own sequin,
on his clumsy forehead; poured into the wound
some of the gunpowder out of his pouch; and,
apologizing for the poorness of the entertainment,
bade him good night, and walked off.</p>

<p>A troop of caleondjees of my acquaintance, reeling
home from a tavern, happened to come up just
as I retired, and took all that I had left. The next
morning the man of buttons departed from Constantinople
without sound of trumpet, before sunrise;

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

and never since has been heard of in the Turkish
dominions.</p>

<p>This little frolic, at the expense of the English
speculator, recommended me to a French chevalier,
come to Stambool on a visit to his kinsman the
ambassador. The lively young gentleman swore
he wanted no other certificate of my character
than my prowess. His object in undertaking the
long journey to Turkey seemed to be to play
on the guitar, and to compose French love songs.
Twice a week a messenger of the embassy was
despatched to Paris, with M. de Vial's effusions, in
order that his friends at home might see how he
employed his time abroad. <i>Par contre</i>, he had determined,
as soon as he returned to France and
found himself at leisure, to write a detailed account
of Turkey&mdash;rather however as it ought to be, than
as it was. For M. de Vial disapproved of the
Othoman system <i>in toto:</i> and hence he deemed it
sheer loss of time to visit the curiosities of its capital.
The only thing he could have liked&mdash;had he not
been too busy learning the rome&iuml;ka&mdash;was an <i>affaire
de c&oelig;ur</i> with the favourite Sultana; and for a long
while he continued exceedingly anxious to give the
ladies of the imperial harem a f&ecirc;te on the Black
sea; but that project failing, from their sending no
answers to his notes, he wondered who could bear
the dowdies of Constantinople, that had seen the

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

<i>Trois Sultanes</i> of Marmontel at the Paris opera.
In truth M. de Vial had no patience with the barbarians.
Their language was a gibberish, <i>o&ugrave; l'on
n'entendait rien;</i> and they had so little <i>savoir vivre</i>,
that they let their heads be chopped off like cabbage
tops. Desirous however of treating them to a sight
of the last Paris fashions, he decked out his nether
man in pea-green coloured cloth, and got himself
chastised by a hot-headed emir,<sup id="r107"><a href="#n107">107</a></sup> for thus profaning
the forbidden colour&mdash;almost too sacred with the
Turks for the head itself. In his turn M. de Vial
sent the cousin of Mohammed a challenge, with
which the emir lit his pipe. At last, after a whole
day uselessly employed in ogling the Sultana mother
through a huge telescope, from the tower of Galata,
the chevalier felt seized with a desperate fit of ennui,
laid in a reasonable stock of embroidered handkerchiefs,
to throw to the Paris belles after a Turkish
fashion which the Turks know nothing of, and determined
to bid adieu to Pera. My services and
talents he transferred, ere he went, to a flaxen-headed
Swedish baron, whose ruddy face had inflamed the
susceptible heart of the droguemaness of the Venetian
mission, and who was so highly favoured by his
doting mistress, that every night she allowed him
to pay her whole loss at <i>tresette</i>. This lady was an
uncommon proficient in writing. Proud of an accomplishment
which so few of her colleagues possessed,
she used every morning to fire at her lover

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

a little billet-doux of three or four pages. These
refreshing epistles I came to call for as regularly as
for the water from the well, the moment the husband
was supposed to have gone forth to the Re&iuml;s-effendee,
with the scarce shorter memorials of the
Serenissima Republica&mdash;at that period any thing
but serene. This same husband, though only four
feet high, presumed to be jealous; and the correspondence,
therefore, was to be kept from his knowledge&mdash;a
circumstance which rendered my office of
Mercury an employment of some trust.</p>

<p>I acted accordingly. Tired of being postman
without pay, I one day hinted to the lady that I
should expect some species of acknowledgment for
my trouble. Madame D&mdash;&mdash;i was one of those fair
ones for whom Cupid must tip his dart with gold,
or they recoiled unfelt. She resented my freedom,
called me a low-born fellow, and forbade me her
presence. The tide of amorous billets now ceased
to flow for want of a channel. Nothing but my
forgiveness of the insult could make it resume its
course. On the part of the lady, accordingly, advances
were soon made towards a reconciliation,
and on mine, every spark of resentment was magnanimously
extinguished until further occasion. I saw
myself formally reinstated in my daily office.</p>

<p>The Hyperborean lover&mdash;not quite so brisk a
correspondent as his mistress&mdash;used to answer about
one letter in three or four. This, however, in the

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

course of a few weeks began to form a very respectable
amatory collection. The pink-edged, perfumed epistles&mdash;regularly
endorsed&mdash;were all deposited by the
delighted droguemaness in a little mother-of-pearl
casket, which she kept for the benefit of her heirs
by the side of her reliquary. From one of those
strange incidents which will happen in the course
of things, this casket, though most carefully locked
up, fell into my hands; but no contrivance of mine
could conjure the key out of the lady's unfathomable
pocket. She used to sleep with the huge receptacle
under her pillow, in order to obtain pleasant dreams.
It mattered little: I had no sort of curiosity to peruse
the correspondence. I contented myself with carefully
wrapping up the box, sealing the cover, and begging
the signor drogueman&mdash;that is to say, the signora's
husband&mdash;to keep the parcel in trust for me, as most
valuable property, and such as could not be committed
to fitter hands. The rod thus kept suspended
over his faithless spouse, the reward of my discretion
past and future was demanded with becoming humility;
and, to do Madame D&mdash;&mdash;i justice, when
she found that no other way of extricating herself was
left, she showed every readiness to listen to the voice
of reason.</p>

<p>By some accident, however, the baron got wind
of these transactions, and, so far from feeling flattered
as he ought to have been, with the anxiety which
his mistress evinced to recover his letters, had

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

the ingratitude to cavil about the mode, and left the
fair one to find what consolation she could in the
re-perusal of his correspondence. Jupiter's retreat
became the signal for that of Mercury. I wanted
nothing more of the commonwealth of Venice, and,
with a mock farewell, left the droguemaness punished
alike in her pride and her avarice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner had my various little trades rendered
me a person of some substance, than I began to
think of purchasing a berath:<sup id="r108"><a href="#n108">108</a></sup>&mdash;I mean one of
those patents of exemption from the rigour of
Turkish despotism, which the Sultan originally
granted to foreign ministers, in behalf only of such
rayahs as they had occasion to engage in their immediate
service, but which these excellent economists
now readily sell to whatever other subjects of the
Grand Signor are disposed to pay the current price
of the article. To a youth like me it was highly
desirable to possess a paper, through whose magic
power a native might in the very capital of his natural
sovereign outstep the limits of his jurisdiction,
brave his authority, put himself on the footing of a
stranger, and, from being heretofore an Armenian or
a Greek, at once find himself transformed into a
reputed Italian, or German, or Frenchman, wear
the gaudiest colours in competition with the Turks
themselves, and strut about the streets in that <i>summum
bonum</i>, a pair of yellow papooshes.</p>

<p>The thing had been put into my head by an

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

Italian missionary of the Propaganda, who, considering
me as a sort of stray from the Greeks, had determined
to stow me safely within the pale of the
Romans. On first perceiving his drift I gave his
pious exertions small encouragement; observing
that early habits, as well of belief as of action,
could only be rooted out later in life, either by the
most irresistible arguments, or the most palpable
interest to adopt different tenets. To this remark
the missionary only replied that he had a very general
acquaintance at Pera, and, consequently, possessed
many opportunities of recommending a well-disposed
youth to travellers. The observation was
in point. Impressed with its full weight I began
to indulge padre Ambrogio, whenever I happened
to be out of place, with a little conference on the
disputed articles; and for every Greek variation
from the Latin creed which I yielded up, he used to
find me a new situation. Unfortunately the discussion
of the Greek liturgy ran so parallel with that
of the signora D&mdash;&mdash;i's correspondence, and the interviews
with the friar were so interwoven with those
with the lady, that I sometimes confounded the two
subjects, and more than once, in a fit of absence, let
padre Ambrogio into the mysteries of my negotiation,
instead of learning from him those of his faith.
The ghostly conferences, however, only ceased entirely
when the friar very nefariously disappointed
me, in favour of another neophyte, of an excellent

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

employment for which I had sacrificed the whole
procession according to the Greeks. Hearing of
this flagrant act of bad faith, I called upon him in a
very great passion; told him I again disbelieved all
that he had enticed me to believe; and, leaving him
exceedingly dismayed at my unexpected rebellion,
went to dispel the confusion in my head by a walk
on the road to Dolma-backtch&eacute;.</p>

<p>The snow which had lain several days on the
ground having entirely disappeared, I met a good
many people taking the air; but who all looked, I
thought, as if like me they had been bewildered by
some friar or derwish. At last came a Turkish
woman of rank, accompanied by a long train of
females. The pavement being narrow, I stood up
against the wall to let her pass. As she brushed
by me, her hand, gently pressing against the back of
mine, gave me reason to think that I had not been
unnoticed. A gay adventure seldom found me slow
to engage in it, be what it might the peril of the
enterprise. I therefore let the lively group trot on
a few yards, and then turned back hastily myself,
in the manner of a person who recollects having left
something behind. Thus, without casting right or
left a single glance which might savour of design, I
gave the lady an opportunity of minutely scrutinising
my appearance, should she be disposed to
cultivate my merits. That done, I crossed over to

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

the other side, and stole away into a by-lane, for
fear of rousing the suspicions of her suite.</p>

<p>The next day, however, I failed not at the same
hour to take a walk in the same street, and again
did the same the next day, and the next; in the
full expectation, each time, of meeting with some
faithful Iris, commissioned to give me the verbal
assurance of my good fortune.</p>

<p>During a whole week, my punctuality continued
without the least abatement. As sure as the clock
struck one I used to sally forth, and display my
handsomely attired person before every woman,
young or old, fair or ugly, who bore the least appearance
of coming on my business. Vain and
fruitless diligence! The busier females passed on
without noticing my disconsolate figure at all; the
less diligent baggages, who remarked my airs and
graces, only answered them with laughing. Some,
who had become familiar with my forlorn perambulations,
ironically pitied me for the cruelty of my
mistress. It was worse when two or three <i>goules</i>,
that haunted the same street, seriously undertook
to console me under my disappointment, and put
me in the greatest fright, lest, by their unconcealed
advances in the broad glare of day, they should
drive away any messenger of love that might be on
the wing.</p>

<p>At last I lost all patience, and was going in good

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

earnest to execute the resolution fifty times solemnly
taken, and as often again broken, of giving up the
vain pursuit, when, just as for the last time I paced
down the oft-trodden pavement, looking anxiously
round on all sides to see what good tidings might
still be in the wind, I perceived a jewess&mdash;seemingly
equally on the alert with myself&mdash;who eyed me
with a promising air. I coughed once or twice;
and this signal inducing the old dame to approach,
we opened a parley. My answers tallying with her
private tokens, she soon became confidential.</p>

<p>"You must know," said she, "I am a tradeswoman,
one who goes about to ladies' houses to provide
them with . . . . . . ."</p>

<p>"What signifies, my dear,"&mdash;cried I, interrupting
her&mdash;"what you are, and what you provide
your customers with? That speaks for itself. Only
tell me who the lady is, who graciously condescends
to make me the object of your embassy."</p>

<p>"The lady, answered the jewess, "is the young
wife of an old Turkish effendee of very high rank.
Her own birth and fortune made her parents stipulate
that her spouse should have no other wife
but herself.&mdash;Nor has he; but while he adheres
to the letter of the agreement, he violates its spirit.&mdash;In
short, he totally neglects his handsome helpmate.
This the fair Esm&eacute; properly resents&mdash;and . . . . . ."</p>

<p>"And in me,"&mdash;cried I, interrupting my informer,&mdash;"she

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

shall find the avenger she deserves.
Let us forthwith go!"</p>

<p>"Gently, gently," now whispered the old beldam.
"It is not thus that matters of this sort are conducted.
If the lady, by whom I have the honour of
being employed, were one of your ordinary women
on whom the wind blows as freely as on the weeds
of the desert, all would be easy enough. Females
who go out at all hours to the bath, and to the
market-place, and to the bezesteen, or to visit their
friends, do whatever they please. But cadin Esm&eacute;
is none of those, I'll warrant you. This exalted fair
one has in her own apartment baths of marble and
gold; twenty slaves are always ready at her nod to
execute whatever whim may cross her fancy; the
richest goods of every country are brought from
every quarter to be spread out before her at her
toilet; her own chamber opens on gardens whose
roses make those of Sheeraz look pale. In short&mdash;poor
thing!&mdash;she can find nothing to want abroad;
and when she does go out, it seems rather for the
sole purpose of seeing how superior is all that she
leaves at home. Then she generally only travels
about in a close carriage. Her visits are confined to
two or three of her near relations; and she so seldom
finds an excuse for stirring out on foot, that the day
you met her was the first time these six months she
had stepped across her own threshold. Even when
she indulges in a little excursion of the sort, she

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

only moves, as you see, accompanied by a swarm of
servants, or rather, of spies."</p>

<p>"You only add fuel to my flame," cried I.
"The more difficult the enterprise, the nobler the
victory!"&mdash;and immediately we fell to discussing
the ways and means. A hundred different schemes
were alternately proposed and rejected. At last a
contrivance was hit upon, only liable to half a dozen
radical objections. Still it was the best, and therefore
adopted. A friend of the jewess's, equipped
as a woman of rank, was to spend the day on a visit
to the lady Esm&eacute;, whose husband could not, during
that period, intrude upon the privacy of his wife's
apartment. Esm&eacute; would thus obtain an opportunity
of slipping out in the attire of a slave, of stopping
at the jewess's own abode, there to put on Greek
habiliments, and of thence going to meet me at
some selected house in Galata. After the interview,
she would have nothing to do but to resume her
Turkish dress, in order to release by her return her
pretended visitor. The plan required some preparation,
and the day after the next was fixed upon
for its execution.</p>

<p>Matters being thus all apparently settled:&mdash;"One
word more," added the jewess. "You are aware
that we embark upon an adventure of life and
death. In this nether world the joys of paradise
can only be sipped with the secrecy of the grave.
The least indiscretion brings ruin to us all."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

<p>I begged my instructress to make herself easy on
that score;&mdash;"and," added I in my turn, "there
is one circumstance which the lady may not be
sorry to learn; namely, that in me she will find a
youth not only of the greatest discretion, but of the
most respectable birth and connexions."</p>

<p>I thought the peal of laughter never would have
ended, into which the old hag broke out at this
intimation. "And pray," cried she, "do you
imagine the fair Esm&eacute; is in love with you for your
musty ancestors, or means to show you off to her
acquaintances? For my part, I mistook you for
little better than a porter. If you be a prince, so
much the worse! It will require consideration."&mdash;Here
the beldam hobbled off.</p>

<p>"Can I have marred my hopes by my vanity?"
thought I, after the woman was gone. But though
this idea gave me a little uneasiness, it prevented
me not from bestowing the utmost pains, on the
day appointed, in adorning my person, ere I went
to a place conveniently situated for watching the
entrance of the party into the house agreed upon.</p>

<p>Here minute after minute rolled on, without my
perceiving the least symptom of the looked-for
couple. But what I very clearly discerned instead,
were loud titterings behind a latticed window, which
presently left no doubt in my mind that the whole
interview was a mere waggery of some of the females
who had found me out, and were determined to have

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

a laugh at my expense. The very description of
the lady's grandeur now made that matter palpable
by its exaggeration; and I held myself assured that
the greatest real danger I had to apprehend was
that of becoming the laughing-stock of the whole
district. In this conviction I cursed my credulity,
and set my wits to work, in order to devise how I
might turn the joke against its authors,&mdash;when a
faint murmur made me look round, and behold two
females, carefully muffled up, glide into the place of
our appointment.</p>

<p>"Shall I follow or not?" was now my only
thought,&mdash;"and take my chance of whatever good
or evil may offer?"</p>

<p>The jewess suffered not my suspense to last.
Coming out again:&mdash;"what are you waiting for?"
whispered she impatiently in my ear; and, without
staying for my answer, took me by the hand and
led me up stairs, where, having bidden me not to
be frightened, she left me, and ran down again to
keep watch while I remained.</p>

<p>By some strange perverseness of human nature,
the jewess's seemingly superfluous caution had the
contrary effect from that which was intended; and,
combined with Esm&eacute;'s apparent backwardness to
throw off her feridjee, made me fancy I had been
entrapped with a perfect monster. Full of this
idea, I cursed the Israelite for leaving me thus
committed, would have given the world to have

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

seen her return, even with the account of some most
urgent danger, and stood riveted near the door like
a statue,&mdash;until my expectant fair one, losing all
patience, tore off her envelopes more in anger than
in love, and convinced me of my error in doubting
her attractions.</p>

<p>As her wrath did not continue inexorable, I trust
I may pass over the remaining details of this interview,
without any great violation of my duty as a
biographer:&mdash;they presented strong features of resemblance
with many others of the same description;
and in truth, though the rare beauties of my mistress&mdash;her
soft black eyes, her coral lips, and her
carriage more graceful than the movements of the
sailing swan,&mdash;might have obtained at other times
a more elaborate encomium, thoughts of a sedater
hue occupy my mind at present.</p>

<p>Irksome as I had thought the departure of the
jewess, I thought her return still a thousand times
more barbarous, when, ere we had time to think of
her existence, she reappeared, and with relentless
cruelty summoned us to separate.</p>

<p>It seemed as if we had only just met; and it also
seemed as if we never were to meet again. For the
expedient resorted to could not be repeated; and
our faculties were too much bewildered to think of
any other. Like people just awaking from a rapturous
dream, or rather just shaking off a deep
intoxication, we reeled about, lost in a maze of

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

confused feelings, and able to reflect neither on the
past, the present, nor the future. The vain attempt
to think was soon given up, and we settled to communicate
through the channel of the Israelite, when
our minds should be sobered by separation. At
the moment of parting, however, and when casting
on each other the last farewell glance:&mdash;"what can
I do," cried the grateful Esm&eacute;, "to repay my more
than preserver, my sovereign, and my god; what
gifts worth acceptance can I bestow? Take this,
and this, and this: it is nothing to what I owe
for the felicity conferred; it is all I can give in return;"
and so saying, she tore off her richest jewels,
and heaped upon me&mdash;in spite of my resistance&mdash;strings
of pearls, clasps of rubies, and girdles of
diamonds.</p>

<p>"And do you then imagine," cried I, "that one,
honoured by your smiles, can expect or can want a
recompense of this sort?"</p>

<p>"What signifies," replied the fair one, "what
you expected or what you want!&mdash;You wanted
not the poor recluse Esm&eacute;, when you vouchsafed
to come to me. I have my burthen of gratitude to
lessen. For my sake, I must give, and for mine
you must receive."</p>

<p>Still I refused. But a cloud began to gather on
the brow thus far serene: gleams of ominous lightning
flashed from those eyes that before glowed
only with unmixed tenderness. "I see it," cried

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

Esm&eacute;. "You love me not. You fear to take an
earnest. You intend not to return to my arms!"&mdash;and
upon this she tore her jetty locks. The
jewess now stepped forward. "For God's sake,"
said she, "pocket all, as I do. It may cost us our
lives thus to stand upon ceremony." I therefore
yielded, took the proffered gifts, for this magnanimous
act received a last rapturous glance, and tore
myself away.</p>

<p>Scarce deigning to lower my looks to the earth,
scarce feeling the ground that bore my feet, gliding
along on invisible pinions rather than walking, I
proceeded at random, intoxicated with my good
fortune. In my own mind I soared at that moment
above all the monarchs of the globe. Constantinople
seemed too small to contain my exultation,
and, oppressed within its walls by the excess of
my happiness, I went forth at the gates, and poured
out into the country the ebullitions of my joy, and
the ferment of my spirits.</p>

<p>Three good hours of uninterrupted exercise were
requisite to allay them; after which I went home
through the street which had been the scene of my
forlorn perambulations, for the purpose of showing
its familiars the difference in my air!</p>

<p>Here however let me for an instant interrupt the
thread of my subject, in order to observe that,
though my courtships have thus far occupied a
great portion of my narrative, it is not the history
of my loves, but that of my life, which I wish to

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

record. Instead therefore of detailing the scheme
through means of which was effected our next
meeting, and the many others which followed, I
shall only in general state that each interview seemed
to increase the fondness of my mistress. Every circumstance
of my situation which gradually unfolded
itself to her knowledge, only gave me new attractions
in her eyes. Above all she delighted in that
inferiority of my condition to her own, which enabled
me to become indebted for ease, affluence,
and whatever else appeared desirable, to her sole
affection. Hers was the mighty bliss of giving me
all I possessed; of making me all I was.</p>

<p>Out of compliment to her taste, I bestowed upon
my person the utmost attention. The berath which
before I had coveted I now failed not to purchase, and
the gold which I accepted for the sake of peace, I
laid out in such a way as to make the liberalities of
the donor yield her eyes at least an ample return.
Every time I appeared anew in her presence, it was
with some fresh improvement in my ostensible person.
Now and then, indeed, too plentiful supplies
proved hostile to my prudence; but if an opulence to
which I had not been accustomed often got me into
scrapes, it always got me out again; nor left me, like
modern friends, in the difficulties into which it had
lured me. In one of my midnight orgies&mdash;for instance,&mdash;being
summoned by the patrole before the
waywode, "I was actually on my way to his worship,"

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

I forthwith exclaimed, "in order to discharge
an old debt. Pray, gentlemen, have the goodness to
take charge of these few sequins: but only pay them
at your own convenience;"&mdash;and immediately my
freedom was restored to me with a hundred bows
and scrapes. In another frolicsome mood, making so
great a noise on the canal that the Bostandjee-bashee
had me handcuffed in spite of my berath&mdash;on the
plea that it was too dark to read it:&mdash;"I have
heard," I cried, "that a fine carbuncle will throw
out as much light as a lamp. Vouchsafe, mighty
sir, to try the experiment with this ring;"&mdash;and all
at once the officer saw so clearly I was a berathlee,
as to grant me the entire range of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>These occasional frolics were necessary to keep
up my spirits under the depression which they
began to experience. For my intrigue cast upon
my free agency a constraint which I had never felt
before. I, who until that period knew not what it
was to abstain or to conceal; who even with the
haughtiest of the archondessas of the Fanar used
to assert my liberty, and to mock the fair one's rage,
now felt anxious, with the prisoner of a harem, to
dissemble the least act of inconstancy, however unpremeditated.
Nor let it be supposed that this conduct
proceeded from any fear of stopping the current
of the lady's bounty. It is true that where I gave
my love, and would have given my utmost largess,
had the means been mine, I scrupled not, with the

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

affections, to receive the gifts of my wealthy mistress:
but all the gold of Peru could not have purchased
my person, had not my heart fully ratified
the bargain; and Esm&eacute; owed to her situation&mdash;not
to my selfishness&mdash;a consideration which never yet
had accompanied my preferences. The archon's
wife, a free agent like myself, like me had been
mistress of her choice, and where I sinned against
her, had possessed all the means to retaliate. It
was not so with Esm&eacute;. She was a helpless captive,
who could not punish my offences by following my
example. What with the one seemed a justifiable
proceeding, with the other became wanton cruelty.</p>

<p>And most acutely would the fair Mohammedan
have felt any unnecessary wound inflicted by my
hand: most alive was her susceptible mind to all
the fellest pangs of jealousy. "When first I loved
you," she said, "you had never beheld me, you
knew not whether I was fair or hideous, you could
not harbour the least spark of reciprocal affection;
you might, without the smallest sacrifice on your
part, for ever have kept out of my sight, and left
my hopeless flame, unfed, to die away. This indeed&mdash;had
not your heart been free, and able to
return all the warmth of my feelings&mdash;honour,
justice, and humanity required. You acted otherwise:
ere yet you felt a spark of reciprocal tenderness,
you threw yourself purposely in my way;
you sedulously nourished my passion, and you have

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

carried my madness to that pitch where it must
find yours commensurate, or end in my perdition.
You now are bound to sustain the affection which
you have gratuitously raised: you are pledged to
save me from despair. If, after having fanned my
love into a resistless blaze, you should think of forsaking
me, I die; but the blow by which I fall&mdash;that
same blow shall kill us both."</p>

<p>The same blow did not kill both! For when
long impunity had made me so daring as to invade
the effendee's own roof; when suspicions arose in
the husband's mind which he resolved to verify;
when on he rushed to his harem; when right and
left flew the women's slippers, placed as a spell at
its threshold; when open burst the door of the
sanctuary, and jealousy carried its search into the
inmost recesses of the gynec&aelig;um; when what became
of the hapless Esm&eacute;, heaven, the effendee,
and the Black sea alone can tell,&mdash;not a hair of my
head received the smallest injury. That very impetuosity
of my enemy which seemed to doom me
to certain and immediate destruction, proved the
means of my preservation. In the very act of
making my escape, the door which turned back
upon its hinges turned back upon my person, and
concealed the intruder behind its friendly screen,
till the effendee and his troop had passed by. I
then slipped away, unperceived by any creature
within. Some slaves, however, who kept watch on

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

the outside, seeing me run and in evident confusion,
set up a hue and cry. Finding they gave
me chase, I darted into a mosque, whose open gate
seemed to invite my entrance. All I wanted was
to throw my pursuers off the scent. A few old
Moslemen were in the djamee<sup id="r109"><a href="#n109">109</a></sup> mumbling their
evening prayers; and while the mob outside howled
after the adulterer, the congregation within began
to scream at the yaoor. Thus placed between two
fires, all hopes of escape forsook me. I felt as if I
must&mdash;but for some special miracle&mdash;soon be torn
to pieces!</p>

<p>One human measure only remained to save my
life. I drew my dagger, threw my cloak over my
face, leaned my back against the mihrab,<sup id="r110"><a href="#n110">110</a></sup> and cried,
"I am a Moslemin!"</p>

<p>If there existed not even any positive evidence
of guilt having found its way at all into the effendee's
harem, still less did there exist any direct
proof of my being the offender. All that could be
alleged against me was merely circumstantial. So
far from being found in the wife's faithless arms, I
had not even been caught under the injured husband's
roof. At most I had displayed my activity
somewhat near the dwelling disturbed; but, though
this might be reason enough to massacre an infidel,
a follower of the true faith&mdash;however recent his
conversion&mdash;demanded greater respect.</p>

<p>From the moment therefore in which I invoked

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

the name of the Prophet, every breath of accusation
was hushed, every hand became suspended. A
magic power seemed to arrest the daggers on my
very breast. A fanatical mob instantly took under
its protection the new, the fervent proselyte.</p>

<p>But this proselyte I had bound myself to be. I
had proclaimed myself one of the faithful; and on
the spot, in the very mosque, I went through the
various forms which mark the reclaimed infidel,
and announce his admission into the bosom of
Islamism.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Historians</span> often err in attributing to a single
great cause the effect of many minute circumstances
combined. My sagacious biographer, for instance,
would not fail to place my abjuration of the Christian
faith entirely and solely to the account of my
intrigue with a Turkish fair one, and the desperate
alternative between life and death which ensued.
Nothing would be more erroneous. The seemingly
bold measure had long been preparing <i>in petto;</i>
and the unexpected dilemma to which I was reduced
may only be said to have fixed the period for its
execution.</p>

<p>There had arrived at Pera a foreigner whom I
shall call Eugenius. His ostensible object was to
acquire the ancient lore of the East, in return for
which he most liberally dealt out the new creed of
the West. I cannot better describe him than as
the antipode to father Ambrogio. For as the one
was a missionary of a society for the propagation
of belief, so was the other an emissary of a sect for
the diffusion of disbelief. He meditated indeed
a pilgrimage to the holy land, but with the view

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

to prove more scientifically the fatuity of all things
holy. Reason, philosophy and universal toleration
were the only objects of his reverence; and some of
his tenets which I picked up by the way had in
them a something plausible to my mind, and, if not
true, seemed to my inexperience <i>ben trovati</i>. He
conceived that there might exist offences between
man and man, such as adultery, murder, &amp;c. of a
blacker dye than the imperfect performance of certain
devout practices&mdash;eating pork steaks in Lent included;
and, above all, he thought that whatever
number of crimes a man might, on using his utmost
diligence, crowd in the short span of this life, they
still might possibly be atoned for in the next by
only five hundred thousand million of centuries (he
would not abate a single second) of the most excruciating
torture; though this period was absolutely
nothing compared with eternity. As to his
other tenets, they were too heinous to mention.</p>

<p>Ere father Ambrogio was aware that Eugenius
broached such abominable doctrines, he had introduced
me to him in the quality of drogueman, or
rather of cicerone; and the tone in which I was
received might have made the father suspect that
all was not right. But the father's range of intellectual
vision extended not further than his own
nose,<sup id="r111"><a href="#n111">111</a></sup> and that nose was a snub one.</p>

<p>"It was you quibbling, sophistical Greeks,"
cried Eugenius laughing, "who, proud, at the

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

commencement of the Christian era of your recently
imported gnosticism, perverted by its mystic doctrine
the simple tenets of Christianity. It was
you who, ever preferring the improbable and
the marvellous to the natural and the probable,
have contended for taking in a literal, and therefore
in an absurd sense, a thousand expressions
which in the phraseology of the East were only
meant as figurative and symbolical; and it was
you who have set the baneful example of admitting,
in religious matters, the most extraordinary
deviations from the course of nature and from
human experience, on such partial and questionable
evidence, as, in the ordinary affairs of man,
and in a modern court of justice, would not be
received on the most common and probable occurrence."</p>

<p>Father Ambrogio, who conceived that every reflection
upon the Greeks must be in favour of the
Romans, was delighted with this speech, and, as he
went away, earnestly recommended to me to treasure
up in my memory all the sagacious sayings of the
wise man whom I had the happiness to serve.</p>

<p>But it was not long before he changed his mind.
The very next day, when I called on Eugenius, I
found padre Ambrogio in most angry discussion
with him about the doctrine of Divine clemency,
which the friar could not abide. Eugenius at last
was obliged to say in his laughing way, that since

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

the father appeared so incurably anxious for endless
punishment, all he could do for him was to pray
that, by a single exception in his favour, he at least
might be damned to all eternity. Father Ambrogio,
who never laughed, and who hated Eugenius the
more for always laughing, upon this speech left the
room: but the next time he met me alone, he very
seriously cautioned me against one who, he was
sure, must be a devil incarnate.</p>

<p>"If so," thought I, "he preaches against his
own trade; and his principal is little obliged to
him for making his dominion a mere leasehold,
instead of a perpetuity." Meanwhile I resolved
not to be too sure, and, when Eugenius took off
his clothes, watched whether I could perceive the
cloven foot. Nothing appearing at all like it, and
his disposition seeming gentle, obliging and humane,
I began to be fond of his company,&mdash;until, from
liking the man, I unfortunately by degrees came
not to dislike some parts of the doctrine of which
he was the apostle.</p>

<p>Eugenius differed in one respect from his brethren
of the new school. While they wished to subvert
all former systems <i>in toto</i>, ere they began to re-edify
according to their new plan, he, on the contrary,
only contended for the appeal to reason on
points of internal faith, and urged, in external
practices, the propriety of conforming to the established
worship;&mdash;and this, not from selfish but

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

philanthropic motives; "for," said he, "while the
vulgar retain a peculiar belief, they will close their
eyes and hearts against whatever practical good
those wish to do them who join not in their creed;
and should they, in imitation of their betters, give
up some of their idle tenets,&mdash;unable immediately,
like those they imitate, to replace the checks of
superstition by the powers of reason&mdash;they will
only from bad lapse into worse, let loose the reins
to their passions, and exchange errors for crimes."</p>

<p>Now, in conformity to this doctrine of my master's,
what could be clearer than that it behoved
me, where the koran was become the supreme law,&mdash;as
a quiet orderly citizen, zealous in support of
the establishment&mdash;with all possible speed to become
a Mohammedan? Should there happen to
be any personal advantage connected with this
public duty; should my conforming to it open
the door to places and preferments from which I
otherwise must remain shut out; should it raise
me from the rank of the vanquished to that of
the victors, and enable me, instead of being treated
with contempt by the Turkish beggar, to elbow the
Greek prince, was that my fault? or could it be a
motive to abstain from what was right, that it was
also profitable?</p>

<p>The arguments appeared to me so conclusive,
that I had only been watching for an opportunity

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

to throw off the contemptuous appellation of Nazarene,
and to become associated to the great aristocracy
of Islamism, some time before the fair Esm&eacute;
lent the peculiar grace of her accent to its Allah
Illah Allah; and though, for the credit of my sincerity,
I could wish my conversion not exactly to
have taken place at the particular moment at which
the light of truth happened to shine upon me, yet,
all things considered, I thought it wiser not to
quibble about punctilios, than to be sewed in a
sack, and served up for breakfast to some Turkish
shark.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the doctrine of pure reason
ended in making me a Mohammedan:&mdash;but with a
pang I quitted for the strange sound of Selim my
old and beloved name of Anastasius, given me by
my father, and so often and so sweetly repeated
by my Helena.</p>

<p>I was scarce a Mohammedan skin deep, when I
again met padre Ambrogio, whom since my affair
with Esm&eacute; I had entirely lost sight of, and who
knew not my apostasy.</p>

<p>"Son," said he in a placid tone, "we are all at
times prone to passion. I myself, meek as you now
see me, have had my unguarded moments: but it
is impossible that you should not wish to achieve
the glorious work so well begun. Suppose therefore
we resume our spiritual exercises. You are

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

already so far advanced in the right road, that we
cannot fail ultimately to make you an exemplary
Roman catholic."</p>

<p>"Father," answered I, "what may ultimately
happen, it is not in man to foresee: mean time,
since we met last, another trifling impediment has
arisen to my embracing the Latin creed. I am
become a Moslemin."</p>

<p>At this unlooked-for obstacle, father Ambrogio
started back full three yards. "Holy virgin!" exclaimed
he, "how could you make such a mistake?"</p>

<p>Not caring to assign the true cause; "I wanted,"
said I, "to secure in the next world a little harem
of black-eyed girls."</p>

<p>At this speech father Ambrogio fetched a deep
sigh; and began to muse, looking alternately at
his habit and at mine.&mdash;"Well!" said he, after a
pause; "at least you no longer are a Greek, and
that is something;" and hereupon he departed,&mdash;wondering,
I suppose, where, in his paradise,
Mohammed meant to dispose of the angels whose
eyes were blue.</p>

<p>I never was very ambitious of learning, but my
new godfather, a formal Turkish grey-beard,
could not brook my total ignorance of my new
religion. "You are not here among Scheyis,"<sup id="r112"><a href="#n112">112</a></sup>
said he, "who under the name of Mohammedans
live the lives of yaoors, drink wine as freely as
we swallow opium, and make as little scruple of

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

having in their possession paintings of pretty faces,<sup id="r113"><a href="#n113">113</a></sup>
as if at the day of judgment they were not to find
souls for all those bodies of their own creating.
You are&mdash;Allah be praised!&mdash;among strict and
orthodox Sunnees; and, however an old believer
may have had time to forget his creed, a young
neophyte should have it at his fingers' ends."</p>

<p>So I had to learn my catechism afresh. Great
indeed was my inclination to expostulate:&mdash;but all
I could obtain was to be provided with a teacher
who, for my twenty paras a lesson, should put me
in the way of passing over the bridge Seerath<sup id="r114"><a href="#n114">114</a></sup> as
speedily as possible. And this I was promised.</p>

<p>Nothing therefore could exceed my surprise,
when in walked the gravest of the whole grave
body of doctors of law&mdash;the very pink and quintessence
of true believers; one who would not miss
saying his namaz regularly four times a day, three
hundred and sixty days in the year,<sup id="r115"><a href="#n115">115</a></sup> for all the
treasures of the Devas:<sup id="r116"><a href="#n116">116</a></sup> who, to obtain the epithet
of hafeez,<sup id="r117"><a href="#n117">117</a></sup> had learnt his whole koran by heart
unto the last stop; and who, not satisfied with
praying to God like other people, had linked himself
to a set of dancing derwishes, for the sole
purpose of addressing the Deity with more effect
in a sugar-loaf cap, and spinning round the room
like a top:&mdash;a personage who, in a devout fit, would
plump down upon his knees in the midst of the
most crowded street, without turning his head

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

round before he had finished the last reekath<sup id="r118"><a href="#n118">118</a></sup> of
his orison, if all Constantinople were trembling in
an earthquake; who, considering all amusements
as equally heinous, made no difference between a
game of chess or mangala and illicit attentions to
one's own great-grandmother, and once, in his devout
fury, with his enormous chaplet positively
demolished Karagheuz<sup id="r119"><a href="#n119">119</a></sup> in the midst of all his drollery:
a personage who, at the end of the Ramadan,<sup id="r120"><a href="#n120">120</a></sup>
looked like a walking spectre, and the very
last time of this fast absolutely doubled its length,
only for having snuffed up with pleasure, before the
hours of abstinence were over, the fumes of a kiebab
on its passage out of a cook-shop: a personage who
had an absolute horror of all representations of the
human figure&mdash;those of Saint Mark on the Venetian
sequin only excepted: a personage, in fine, who
already was surnamed in his own district the wely
or saint; and whom all his neighbours were dying
to see dead, only that they might hang their rags
round his grave, and so get cured of the ague.</p>

<p>When this reverend moollah<sup id="r121"><a href="#n121">121</a></sup> first made his
appearance, his face was still bedewed with tears of
sympathy, occasioned by a most heart-rending scene
of domestic woe, which his charitable hand had just
assuaged. In an adjoining street he bad found,
stretched out on the bare pavement, a whole miserable
family&mdash;father, mother, brothers, sisters, together
with at least a dozen children of tender age&mdash;in

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

a state of complete starvation. The very description
of such a piteous sight harrowed up my
soul. Lest however the holy man should incur a
suspicion of having been betrayed into a weakness so
reprehensible as that of pity for the human species&mdash;for
which he felt all the contempt it deserved, and
which he never presumed to solace under any of
the visitations inflicted by Providence,&mdash;I should
add that the wretched objects of his present compassion
were of that less reprobated sort, the canine
species! They belonged to those troops of unowned
dogs which the Turks of Constantinople
allow to live in their streets on the public bounty,
in order to have the pleasure of seeing them bark
at the Christians whom their Frank dress betrays.
To these, and other beings of the irrational genus,
were confined the benefactions of my tutor; but, if
his own species had few obligations to acknowledge
from him, he was recorded as having purchased
the liberty of three hundred and fifty canary
birds in cages, granted pensions to the baker and
butcher for the maintenance of fifty cats, and left at
least a dozen dogs, whom he found on the <i>pav&eacute;</i>,
handsomely provided for in his will.</p>

<p>No sooner was my venerable instructor comfortably
seated on his heels in the angle of my sofa,
than, looking around him with an air of complacency,
as if he liked my lodgings, he told me to my infinite
satisfaction, that, provided he only took his

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

station there for two hours every day, he pledged
himself before the end of the first year to instruct
me thoroughly in all the diversities of the four
orthodox rituals&mdash;the Hanefy, Schafey, Hanbaly,
and Maleky; together with all that belonged to the
ninety-nine epithets of the Deity, represented by
the ninety-nine beads of the chaplet. In the space
of another twelvemonth he ventured to hope that
he might go over with me the principal difference
between the two hundred and eighty most canonical
mufessirs or commentators on the Koran, as
well as examine the two hundred and thirty-five
articles of the creed, concerning which theologians
disagree; and in the third year of our course, he
promised to enable me completely to refute all the
objections which the Alewys and other dissenters
make to the Sunnee creed; and to give me a general
idea of the tenets of the seventy-two leading
heretical sects, from that of Ata-hakem-Mookanna,
or the one-eyed prophet with the golden mask, to
Khand-Hassan, the fanatic who eat pork and drank
wine in the public market-place like any Christian:
so as, through dint of so much diligence, on the
fourth and last year to have nothing to do but to
go over the whole again, and imprint it indelibly on
my memory. By way of a little foretaste of the
method of disputation in which he promised to instruct
me, he took up one of the controverted points;
first raised his own objections against it; and then&mdash;as

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

he had an indubitable right to do with his undisputed
property&mdash;again completely overset them
by the irresistible force of his arguments; after
which&mdash;having entirely silenced his adversary, he
rose, equally proud of the acuteness of his own rhetoric,
and charmed with the sagacity with which I
had listened.</p>

<p>The truth is I had fallen asleep; for which reason,
when I suddenly awoke on the din of his argumentation
ceasing, I shook my head with a profound
air, and by way of showing how much in earnest I
meant to be, with a very wise look said I could not
give my unqualified assent until I heard both sides
of the question. Thus far I had heard neither.</p>

<p>This determination rather surprised my doctor,
who seemed to have relied on my faculty of implicit
credence. "Hear both sides of the question!" exclaimed
he in utter astonishment. "Why, that is
just the way never to come to a conclusion, and to
remain in suspense all the days of one's life! Wise
men first adopt an opinion, and then learn to defend
it. For my part I make it a rule never to hear but
one side; and so do all who wish to settle their
belief."</p>

<p>The thing had never occurred to me before; but
I thought it had in it a something plausible, which
at any rate made me resolve not to lengthen the four
years' course by idle doubts. Accordingly in the
three first lessons I agreed to every thing the doctor

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

said or meant to say, even before he opened his
mouth, and only wondered how things so simple,
for instance, as the Prophet's ascent to the third
heaven on the horse Borak, with a peacock's tail
and a woman's face (I mean the horse), could be
called in question. Unfortunately, when in the fourth
lesson the moollah asserted that Islamism was destined
ultimately to pervade the whole globe, a
preposterous longing seized me to show my learning.
I asked how that could be, when, as Eugenius
had asserted, an uninterrupted day of several months
put the fast of the Ramadan wholly out of the question
near the poles? This difficulty, which the doctor
could not solve, of course put him into a great
rage. He reddened, rubbed his forehead, repeated
my query, and at last told me in a violent perspiration,
that if I mixed travellers' tales with theology,
he must give up my instruction.</p>

<p>I was too happy to take him at his word; instantly
paid what I owed for the lessons received;
and begged henceforth to remain in contented ignorance.
Lest however I should appear petulant
to my godfather, I went and desired him to find me
a moollah that was reasonable.</p>

<p>"A moollah that is reasonable!" exclaimed an
old gentleman present, who happened to belong to
the order himself. "Why, young man, that is a
most unreasonable request. The Koran itself declares
the ink of the learned to be equal in value

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

to the blood of martyrs; and where will a single
drop be shed in disputation, if all agree to be reasonable?
But come," added he, laughing, "I will
undertake, without a fee, to teach you in one word
all that is necessary to appear a thorough bred
Moslemin; and if you doubt my receipt, you may
even get a fethwa of the Mufty, if you please, to
confirm its efficacy. Whenever you meet with an
infidel, abuse him with all your might, and no one
will doubt you are yourself a stanch believer." I
promised to follow the advice.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stern</span> winter had breathed his last; his churlish
progeny had fled. The waves were no longer lashed
by storms, nor was the earth fettered by frost.
Constantinople hailed the day, revered alike by
Greeks and Turks, when St. George opens in state
the gaudy portals of the spring. The north wind had
ceased to howl through Stambool's thin habitations.
Mild zephyr reigned alone; and as his fragrant
breath went forth in gentle sighs, the white winding-sheet
of snow shrunk on the swelling mountain, while
a soft and verdant carpet of young herbage spread
along the hollow valley. The taller trees of the
forest might still slumber awhile: the lesser shrubs
and plants of the garden were all waking, to resume
their summer robes of rich and varied dye. Blushing
blossoms crowned their heads, and every transient
gale was loaded with their fragrance. Over
fields enamelled with the crimson anemone fluttered
millions of azure butterflies, just broke forth from
their shells with the flowers on which they fed, and
hardly able yet to unfurl their wings in air: while

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

on every bough was heard some feathered songster,
hailing the new season of joy and of love. The
very steeds of the imperial stables, liberated that
day from their dark winter stalls, measured with
mad delight the verdant meads of Kiadhan&eacute;, while
their joyful neighing re-echoed from the hills
around. Under each dazzling portico reflected
in the Bosphorus were seen groups of Ich-oglans
and pages, sporting their new spring suits, like
gilded beetles, in the sun. All eyes seemed riveted
on the Othoman fleet, which in gay and gallant
trim issued forth from the harbour, and, with
every snowy sail swelling in the breeze, majestically
advanced towards Marmora's wider basin,
there to commence its yearly cruise through the
mazy Archipelago. Of the immense population of
Constantinople a part was skimming, in barges
glittering like gold-fish, the scarce ruffled surface of
the channel, while the remainder gaily sauntered on
the fringed terraces that overhang its mirror, and
in the woody vales that branch out from its banks.
On all sides resounded the tuneful lyre and the
noisy cymbal, animating the steps of the joyous
dancers. Nature and art, the human race and
the brute creation, seemed alike to enjoy in every
form of diversified festivity, the epoch when recommence
the hopes, the labours, and the delights of
summer.</p>

<p>I too was one of the mirthful throng. In company

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

with a few Osmanlees, not the most rigid of
their race, I had been indulging in the orgies of
the day outside the gate of Sehvria. Somewhat
flushed with the juice of the berry which Bacchus
first planted in my country, we were returning toward the
Top capoossee,<sup id="r122"><a href="#n122">122</a></sup> when close beside us
came prancing an exceeding bad horseman mounted
on a worse steed. At Constantinople it often occurs
that an old menial, whose rambles never extended
beyond the village of St. Stephens, and whose foot
never pressed a stirrup, is rewarded for his domestic
services by a military fief or zeeameth,<sup id="r123"><a href="#n123">123</a></sup> at ten or
twenty days journey from the capital. He then
first learns to ride in the plains outside the gate of
Andrinople,&mdash;in order that he may know how to
cling to his saddle, when constrained to present himself
before his distant vassals. Of this description
seemed to be the equestrian whose pleasure it was
to annoy us. Proud of his newly acquired horsemanship,
he was incessantly in our way, now trotting,
now prancing, now galloping at full speed; so
as to keep us involved in a constant cloud of dust,
with the additional advantage of expecting every
instant a nearer participation in his horse's kicks
and curvetings. Whether we went slow or fast,
or turned to the right or the left to avoid him,
still he haunted us like our shadow; or, if for a
moment he seemed to have taken his leave, it
was only to raise a fallacious hope, and to return

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

to the charge, like the forest fly, when least expected.
Vexatious as was the fellow's behaviour,
my either less irritable or more sober companions
agreed not to notice it. They would have nothing
to do, they said, with a saucy green-head, only
amenable before his own officers, and sure to be
supported&mdash;be his behaviour what it might&mdash;by all
his comrades. Less patient, or less awed by the Prophet's
kindred, I swore I would grapple with the
emir, and soil with the crimson of his own blood,
the green rag round his thick skull, upon which
he presumed with such insolence,&mdash;when, guessing
my intentions, he buried his sharp stirrups<sup id="r124"><a href="#n124">124</a></sup> in
his lank and harassed steed, and scampered away:
but not before he had succeeded in what seemed
throughout to be the sole aim of all his labour;
namely, in bespattering me from head to foot
with all the mud of almost the only puddle which
the sun's daily increasing power had left in the
road.</p>

<p>Who that&mdash;in the full pride of an entire new suit,
of which the colour has long been pondered over,
the stuff chosen after infinite consideration, the
making only entrusted to the most skilful artists,
the fitting tried in all its various stages, and the
final possession obtained only at the very period
destined for its display&mdash;is fated to see the work of
so much thought and labour irretrievably spoilt
in its first bloom, and ere yet the world has been

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

dazzled by its splendor;&mdash;who, I say, that is fated
to undergo such a trial, ever preserved his temper
unruffled, and was blessed with feelings sufficiently
torpid to abstain from falling out even with blind
undesigning chance?</p>

<p>Then fancy my impatient spirit submitted to this
trial, and that by the unprovoked malice of a fellow
mortal! But a few moments before, alas! the vest
of purple broad cloth, the velvet jacket of emerald
green, the scarlet bernoos<sup id="r125"><a href="#n125">125</a></sup> lined with sky-blue satin,
and the ample trowsers of a blushing lilac, still
shone through the mazy net-work of gold cast over
every seam, in the full perfection of their primitive
purity. After parading their beauties all day long,
like a peacock, in the country, I was only going
homewards to display them all the evening, to still
greater advantage, in the most brilliant coffee-houses
in the town, when all my honours fell blasted in the
bud, and&mdash;through the insolence of a paltry serving-man&mdash;every
item of my gay attire was made to
drip with a black offensive mud; so that I looked
like a once gaudy tulip, whose erect splendor has
been crushed by some ass's heedless hoof. Such
was my indignation at the insult, and still more at
the escape of the culprit, that I felt a positive want
of some luckless wight, on whom to vent my ungovernable
rage.</p>

<p>At that inauspicious moment, who should suddenly
start up, as from the very bowels of the earth,

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

but Anagnosti, whom I had left a prisoner in the
Bagnio!</p>

<p>On quitting that hideous place, I was fully determined
not to let an hour elapse without applying
for my friend's liberation, nor to rest until I had
procured it. For that purpose chiefly I had gone
to Mavroyeni. The reader may remember how I
was received at his door. The fainting fit which
followed this ineffectual visit, the illness in the hospital,
and the indigence I had to encounter on first
being thrown anew upon the world, were circumstances
which combined to prevent for several weeks
all furtherance of my design. When my condition
improved, other impediments arose. I then thought
it advisable to wait till I had earned a character, had
acquired friends among the Franks, and had purchased
the berath which might give greater independence
to my movements in behalf of a rayah.
These desiderata came in due time, but with them
also unfortunately came the infatuation of my
Turkish amour, during which I was obliged, for
my mistress's sake, carefully to avoid attracting the
public attention; and this affair only ended in that
apostacy which made me, bold as I was, dread the
reproachful sight of Anagnosti,&mdash;of him whose faith
neither fear, nor interest, nor even pleasure had
had power to shake. Yet I had not abandoned my
purpose; and had determined, the very day after St.
George, to undertake the seemingly arduous work

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

of my friend's release, when he thus unexpectedly
crossed my way.</p>

<p>The very presence of Anagnosti&mdash;of Anagnosti
so long neglected in his forlorn situation, and of
Anagnosti freed at last from his fetters without my
assistance&mdash;was in itself a severe rebuke. Convicted
by my friend's enlargement of a culpable
neglect, I almost regretted his liberation as premature.
I felt it as an event expressly brought
about to shame me. Though in reality the poor
youth only came from celebrating&mdash;somewhat more
devoutly no doubt&mdash;the same festival<sup id="r126"><a href="#n126">126</a></sup> with myself,
he seemed only to rush thus full upon me, while
yet ignorant of his liberty and unprepared for his
appearance, in order to take me by surprise, and to
enjoy my confusion.</p>

<p>And this idea, mortifying in itself, became doubly
galling at a moment when, had even my conscience
proclaimed me Anagnosti's sole deliverer, I still
would have wished to be spared all expression of his
gratitude. Thrown among Osmanlees proud of
their untainted blood, I had but just asserted a
perfect equality with my lofty companions. I had
sworn indeed that I was not one of those Candiote
Turks<sup id="r127"><a href="#n127">127</a></sup> who, though three parts Greek, are yet
regarded as among the highest mettled of the Sultan's
Mohammedan subjects: but I had sworn to
this truth in a jesting tone; had in consequence been

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

disbelieved as I wished, and had thus found means to
combine with pretensions to strict veracity, the benefit
of a lie: I had even, in conformity with the
moollah's advice, most vehemently abused the whole
race of Christian dogs; and, in the midst of my
success and my exultation, I now stood most unexpectedly
confronted with the only person who
must, by his familiar address, not only overturn the
whole fabric of my raising, but proclaim me a mere
renegado,&mdash;a downright outcast from the very
Bagnio!</p>

<p>A circumstance so provoking&mdash;so subversive of all
my views and wishes&mdash;was sufficient to give Anagnosti,
in my already ruffled mind, the character of an
enemy rather than a friend. The instant I perceived
him, shame set my cheek on fire; I tried to avoid
his irksome notice:&mdash;but already I had caught his
watchful eye.</p>

<p>In this situation I felt that a mere retreating
movement would only invite a more eager advance;
and conceived that nothing but a coolness so marked
on my part as to chill on that of Anagnosti every
demonstration of warmth, and perhaps even to make
him scorn in his contempt of me all signs of recognition,
could save me from his fearful familiarity.
Upon this principle, instead of either darting forward
to meet his embrace, or shrinking from his approach,
I stopped suddenly short, stood entirely motionless,

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

and, with all the dignity of the turban, merely put
out my hand, to receive the homage of his respectful
lip.&mdash;</p>

<p>His first glance, alighting only on my features,
had made him rush forward to press me to his bosom.
His second look, falling on my dress and companions,
again arrested his progress, and seemed to
rivet his feet to the ground. Hence, judging him
sufficiently awed by my mere appearance, I now
ventured to utter some condescending expressions:
but my words he heeded not. Keeping his haggard
eyes fixed on my person, he asked me whether a spell
fascinated his senses, or whether in reality I was
become . . . . a Moslemin, he would have said; but
the hateful appellation he had not power to utter.
Not caring for the completion of the sentence&mdash;"be
Selim what he may," I hastily cried, "proceed thou,
without fear."</p>

<p>The pious ceremonies of the morning had even
carried beyond its usual exalted pitch my friend's
religious enthusiasm. At this mortifying speech,
resentment of my neglect, indignation at my apostacy,
wounded pride, and disappointed affection
took possession of his soul.</p>

<p>"Fear!" exclaimed he,&mdash;repeating my last words
with an hysteric laugh; while his eye darted lightning,
and his lip curled up in scorn;&mdash;"Fear suits
only the deserter of his country and his God!"</p>

<p>So proud a taunt completed the rising ferment of

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

my blood. Enraged at the invective; still more enraged
at its coming from a rayah, from a man of
mean appearance, and in the presence of sneering
Osmanlees, I mechanically thrust my hand in my
girdle, and drew out my handjar. It was an unmeaning
and half involuntary action: I had no fatal
purpose; I intended not&mdash;no! upon the solemn word
of one again prostrate before the cross&mdash;I intended
not to hurt a hair of my friend's sacred head. A
flourish, to dazzle the Osmanlee eyes which were
watching all my motions, was all I had in view.
Frantic, Anagnosti rushed forward and fell,&mdash;fell
upon the too diligently sharpened weapon! Feeling
that its point had entered, he with one hand pressed
it home to his heart, while with the other he struck
me convulsively away. The dagger&mdash;slipping through
my palsied fingers&mdash;remained, as he intended, deep
buried in his side!</p>

<p>Leisurely he drew it out, and with a sort of complacency
viewed his blood as it trickled from the
blade: but presently, his eyes filling with tears,&mdash;tears
not flowing for his present sufferings, but
from the remembrance of things gone by&mdash;"O my
mother, my mother," he exclaimed, "thy dying
words prove true! My friends alone have been my
perdition; and the small crimson speck found on the
bands of our brotherhood is grown into the stream
that now gushes from my heart!&mdash;but at least,
Anastasius,"&mdash;added he, with a look which pierced

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

my very soul,&mdash;"I have prevented him who made a
vow to defend me to his last dying breath, from being
himself the destroyer of my wretched life. When
released from the Bagnio through the kindness
of strangers, I wondered what event caused the
neglect of my friend,&mdash;wondered why Anastasius
alone had abandoned his Anagnosti. Alas! I knew
not that thou hadst forsaken thy God!&mdash;May he
pardon thee as I do. Life to me has long been
bitterness; death is a welcome guest: I rejoin those
that love me,&mdash;and in a better place. Already, methinks,
watching my flight, they stretch out their arms
from heaven to their dying Anagnosti. Thou,&mdash;if
there be in thy breast one spark of pity left for him
thou once namedst thy brother; for him to whom a
holy tie, a sacred vow . . . . . . . Ah! suffer not the
starving hounds in the street . . . . . . See a little
hallowed earth thrown over my wretched corpse."</p>

<p>These words were his last: he staggered; his
body fell lifeless across the highway&mdash;and his spotless
soul flew to heaven.</p>

<p>In the day of battle, so mighty are the preparations
for hurling death at thousands; by so many are
the shafts of the grim destroyer expected, launched,
and felt; so rapidly are the slain often followed by
their slayers, and the mourned by their mourners,
that the harvest of the grave, however dire and
sudden, scarce finds leisure to be noticed; and no
longer appals an imagination already dizzy with excitement,

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

or stunned with repeated blows:&mdash;but,
when, in the hour of mirth and revelry, a single
living frame of exquisite perfection is, by some unforeseen
shaft of fate, suddenly snatched away from
the gay scene, and in the full exercise of all its
energies transformed to a lump of insensible clay;
when we behold it stretched out, equally unconscious
of insult and of pity, in the kindred dust&mdash;how
drear, how awful is the sudden change!</p>

<p>Then add that this frame thus transformed was
that of my friend&mdash;of my brother;&mdash;and that my
own thrice cursed dagger had wrought the deadly
change!</p>

<p>Oppressed at this spectacle beyond the power of
a human pen to describe, I long continued fixed in
intent amazement on the spot; I long continued
gazing on my friend's lifeless form; and at last&mdash;late
at night, and after every curious bystander had insensibly
dropped off&mdash;returned, exhausted with anguish,
into the city, by the same gate through which
in the morning I had sought the country, brimful
of thoughtless mirth.</p>

<p>Sad indeed was now my soul! I felt the hand of
the Almighty growing heavy upon me. I felt the
long series of chastisements beginning which awaited
my apostacy. Precisely where the religion of my
fathers had imposed upon me the most sacred ties,
where by my change I had most grievously sinned
against its high behests, and where the punishment

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

of my infidelity must give my heart the deepest
wound, there the first blow had been struck! It was
because I had abandoned my God that I had been
doomed to lose my friend&mdash;the friend to whom I had
been sworn in his holy name!&mdash;and doomed to lose
that friend by my own baleful hand! And so great
became, from the bitter taste of its first fruits, the
sense of my guilt, that, could I only have avoided the
dismal fate of an utter outcast, forced for ever to fly
from home and country, I should willingly have forfeited
all else which I possessed, even now to abjure
my new errors and to return to my forsaken faith.
Nor did any fear of the consequences which awaited
my rashness mix itself with the feelings called forth
by my misfortune. Had I even been most unquestionably
guilty of the premeditated murder of an
infidel, my life, as a Moslemin, could run no risk
from the award of the Turkish law. But the numerous
circle which had witnessed the scene united in
asserting my entire innocence of the deed which I
bewailed; and, when on the morning ensuing I
presented myself of my own accord at the nearest
mekkiem&eacute;<sup id="r128"><a href="#n128">128</a></sup> to take my trial, the cadee, after exchanging
a few words with his na&iuml;b,<sup id="r129"><a href="#n129">129</a></sup> dismissed me
fully acquitted.</p>

<p>Not so my own conscience! Loud and ceaseless
were its upbraidings. "Thy dagger," it cried, "has
been lifted on thy friend; it has killed thy brother;
it has struck him to the heart, whom it ought to have

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

defended while thy hand could grasp its hilt; its accursed
edge has cut through the holiest of engagements,
and doomed to destruction the sincerest piety
and the tenderest affection. To the last day of thy life,
the wound inflicted by thee on Anagnosti shall continue
to fester in thine own distracted bosom: it shall
remain fresh and green when his mouldering remains
have fallen into dust; it shall follow thee beyond the
grave; it shall make thee dread to meet thy friend
even in the regions of eternal bliss,&mdash;if it should not
eternally close against thee their inexorable doors."</p>

<p>To hush the relentless monitor, to honour my ill
fated friend's remains and to appease his shade,
I did all that I now could do. I not only had his
body carried to the grave in splendid procession,
masses performed for his unspotted soul, the boiled
wheat<sup id="r130"><a href="#n130">130</a></sup> handed round among the congregation, the
purest marble sought for a gorgeous tombstone; I
myself&mdash;clothed as I was in Mohammed's hateful
livery&mdash;followed at a distance the dismal pomp, with
my garments soiled, my feet bare, and my head
strewed with ashes. From an obscure aisle in the
church I beheld the solemn service; saw on the field
of death the pale stiff corpse lowered into its narrow
cell, and hoping to exhaust sorrow's bitter cup,
at night, when all mankind hushed its griefs, went
back to my friend's final resting-place, lay down
upon his silent grave, and watered with my tears the
fresh raised hollow mound.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

<p>In vain! Nor my tears nor my sorrows could
avail. No offerings nor penance could purchase
me repose. Wherever I went, the beginning of
our friendship and its issue still alike rose in view;
the fatal spot of blood still danced before my
steps, and the reeking dagger hovered before my
aching eyes. In the silent darkness of the night I
saw the pale phantom of my friend stalk round my
watchful couch, covered with gore and dust; and
even during the unavailing riots of the day, I still
beheld the spectre rise over the festive board, glare
on me with piteous look, and hand me whatever I
attempted to reach. But whatever it presented
seemed blasted by its touch. To my wine it gave
the taste of blood, and to my bread the rank flavour
of death!</p>

<p>I who before had set at nought even the sober
creed of the sage, now sought comfort in the silly
superstitions of the vulgar. I made offerings to the
inexorable Fates. I supplicated the awful <i>Moirai</i><sup id="r131"><a href="#n131">131</a></sup>
to withhold from me their scourges. Thinking by
swift motion to fly from the vision which every
where pursued my steps, I bestrode the swiftest
coursers, and roamed the country over. I flew
across hill and dale, both early in the morning and
late at night&mdash;now descending headlong the steep
banks of the Propontis, now rushing along the
rugged shores of the Euxine.</p>

<p>Among my acquaintance was a rich Armenian.

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

The fondness for handsome horses, prevalent among
his nation, in him was a perfect passion; but a
passion which the jealous laws of the Turks only
suffered a rayah to indulge in secret. He might
keep, at an immense cost, the most magnificent
coursers that came from his own country: bestride
them he durst not&mdash;except in their stalls. To ride
and to enjoy them he was obliged to hire some
mean Mohammedan; and, as the noble animals
often wanted exercise, he was glad to assist me in
flying from my sorrows, by giving me the unrestrained
use of his costly stud.</p>

<p>Thus enjoying the command of the fleetest horses
and the most active grooms, I took care that neither
should want exercise. I devoted my whole time to
drawing the bow, and flinging the djereed.<sup id="r132"><a href="#n132">132</a></sup> Nowhere
was I seen, but at the Oc-meidan and in the
Hippodrome;<sup id="r133"><a href="#n133">133</a></sup> where I endeavoured to raise my
oppressed spirits, by sending them on the wing after
a barbed arrow or a staff that cleft the air. In order
to concentrate on one point all my faculties and
feelings, I used to set myself a task. I resolved to
hit a particular mark at an assigned distance, and I
left not the spot until I had performed the feat.
This practice gave me a dexterity in warlike exercises,
of which at a later period I reaped the benefit.
At the time of its acquirement, the swiftest motion
of my body was not sufficient to afford my mind
repose. The instant I vaulted into my saddle, the

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

gaunt spectre of death leaped up behind me. I
might walk or I might gallop, saunter along or fly
at full speed; yet would the avenging spirit alike
goad my galled heart, and with his iron gripe wring
my breast to suffocation. If for an instant I breathed
more freely&mdash;if sometimes I conceived a transient
hope that my gloom was wearing out, it soon
proved a mere delusion; and even in Beotia's
swamps, and where autumn seres the leaf, the sun's
enfeebled rays find not greater difficulty to pierce
the chilling mist, than did the least glimpse of hilarity
to penetrate the shroud of anguish which surrounded
my heart.</p>

<p>As a last and desperate resource, I tried to drive
away my frightful visions by gayer dreams, the
children of drowsy opium. I found my way to
the great mart of that deleterious drug, the Theriakee
tchartchee.<sup id="r134"><a href="#n134">134</a></sup> There, in elegant coffee-houses,
adorned with trellised awnings, the dose of delusion
is measured out to each customer according to his
wishes. But, lest its visitors should forget to what
place they are hying, directly facing its painted porticoes
stands the great receptacle of mental imbecility,
erected by Sultan Suleiman for the use of his capital.</p>

<p>In this tchartchee might be seen any day a numerous
collection of those whom private sorrows
have driven to a public exhibition of insanity.
There each reeling idiot might take his neighbour by
the hand, and say: "brother, and what ailed thee,

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

to seek so dire a cure?" There did I with the rest
of its familiars now take my habitual station in my
solitary niche, like an insensible motionless idol,
sitting with sightless eyeballs staring on vacuity.</p>

<p>One day, as I lay in less entire absence than usual
under the purple vines of the porch, admiring the
gold-tipped domes of the majestic Sulimanye, the
appearance of an old man with a snow-white beard,
reclining on the couch beside me, caught my attention.
Half plunged in stupor, he every now and then
burst out into a wild laugh, occasioned by the grotesque
phantasms which the ample dose of madjoon<sup id="r135"><a href="#n135">135</a></sup>
he had just swallowed was sending up to his brain.
I sat contemplating him with mixed curiosity and
dismay, when, as if for a moment roused from his
torpor, he took me by the hand, and fixing on my
countenance his dim vacant eyes, said in an impressive
tone: "Young man, thy days are yet few;
take the advice of one who, alas! has counted many.
Lose no time; hie thee hence, nor cast behind one
lingering look: but if thou hast not the strength,
why tarry even here? Thy journey is but half
achieved. At once go on to that large mansion before
thee. It is thy ultimate destination; and by thus
beginning where thou must end at last, thou mayest
at least save both thy time and thy money."</p>

<p>The old man here fell back into his apathy, but
I was roused effectually. I resolved to renounce the
slow poison of whose havoc my neighbour presented

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

so woful a specimen; and, in order not to preserve
even a memento of the sin I abjured, presented him,
as a reward for his advice, with the little golden receptacle
of the pernicious drug which I used to make
my solace. He took the bauble without appearing
sensible of the gift, while I, running into the middle
of the square, pronounced with outstretched hands,<sup id="r136"><a href="#n136">136</a></sup>
against the execrable market where insanity was sold
by the ounce, a solemn malediction.</p>

<p>The curse, I believe, took effect. Certain it is
that with me seemed to depart for ever the prosperity
of the Theriakee tchartchee. From the day
I turned my back upon its fatal abodes, the use of
wine and spirits may be said in Constantinople to
have superseded that of opium. Every succeeding
year has seen the trade of madjoon decline faster,
and the customers of those that sell it diminish more
rapidly. The old worshippers of the poppy juice
have dropped off like the leaves in autumn, and no
young devotees have sprung up in their stead. The
preparation has not even preserved its adherents
among those men of the law, formerly anxious to
combine, through means of a drug that may be
taken unperceived, the pleasures of intoxication
with the honours of sobriety.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> degrees my purse, exhausted in the daily purchase
of ready-made mirth, had&mdash;by the ill-wearing
of that commodity&mdash;begun to partake of the depression
of my spirits; and on this occasion I found
pecuniary embarrassments an excellent remedy for
a settled melancholy. When a man knows not
how to support life, he has little leisure for feeding
sorrow. To replenish, however, my empty coffers,
I commenced upon a novel pursuit, which, if it
completed the waste of present resources, made me
amends by the brilliancy it cast over my future
prospects.</p>

<p>This I shall explain.</p>

<p>My melancholy, my retirement, and my endeavours
to find relief from my sorrow in superstitious
practices, had brought me in contact with a personage
who long since had exchanged the society
of man for habitual converse with spirits, and who,
disclaiming all further intercourse with the inhabitants
of the earth, employed himself solely in cultivating
an extensive acquaintance in the different
regions of the heavens. The only easy and familiar
chit-chat in which my friend Derwish might be said

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

to indulge, was with the stars. His accurate information
respecting the various occurrences in the
firmament, it is true, gave him so superior an insight
into the affairs of this globe itself, that he could not
help feeling mortified as well as surprised, at seeing
both in potentates and private individuals so unaccountable
a backwardness to profit by his wisdom:
for he was as fond of giving advice as those who
have not the stars to back their opinion;&mdash;and
indeed, who more capable than Derwish of directing
every concern of man? He understood the composition
of cabalistic sentences capable of baffling
the subtlest witchcraft, and disarming the most
determined evil eye: he could tell to a second the
precise period for every critical measure, from the
giving a battle, to the taking a dose of rhubarb;
and in casting nativities and predicting seasons, the
Venice calendar itself must yield to the all comprehending
Derwish. It is well known what innumerable
little devils float in air, always on the watch,
when people inadvertently yawn, to whip into their
mouths and slip down their throats, when they
make sad intestine commotion in their stomachs.
These he possessed the art of expelling with rare
success, and, soon preparing to soar far beyond
his former flights, he was at the eve, when I made
his acquaintance, of a discovery which promised
mines of wealth to whoever might choose to join
him in its pursuit. It consisted in ascertaining by

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

the itching of one's fingers what heaps of gold lay
buried under those ancient piles which&mdash;like the
arches of Backtch&eacute;-keui,<sup id="r137"><a href="#n137">137</a></sup> the ruins in Greece, and
the pyramids of Egypt&mdash;are mistaken by the ignorant
for aqueducts, and temples, and mausolea, but
by the wise are known to be the secret treasuries of
the Constantines, the Suleimans, and the Pharaohs
of old. The exact situation of the deposits known;
what so easy as to pull down the buildings over
them!</p>

<p>Ere, however, this measure could be quite accomplished,
other resources, less splendid no doubt, but
more acceptable, and in which Eblis<sup id="r138"><a href="#n138">138</a></sup> had no hand,
lent me their seasonable aid.</p>

<p>One day when walking through Galata with a
brother in distress; "See," said I to my companion,
"all those bales of costly goods tossed about on the
quay like common ware! For whom think you
they are landing? Why, for some old churl, to be
sure, immured in his dingy counting-house, and
who perhaps will never behold with his own eyes
either their contents, or even their final produce.
Fortune reserves all her favours for those who only
know their amount by a cipher more or less in their
ledger. Young fellows like us, who would proclaim
her bounty by sound of trumpet, and sow its
golden fruits far and wide in the world, the churlish
prude leaves to starve."</p>

<p>"Fortune, gentlemen," observed the caravokeiri<sup id="r139"><a href="#n139">3</a></sup>

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

of the ship, who had overheard my speech,
"cannot, if she be a lady, dislike her votaries more
than other females do, for being young: but perhaps,
like other ladies, to be won, she must be courted."</p>

<p>I now recognised in the captain one of our
islanders: he knew me before. "You, sir," added
he, "might have had the goddess in question on
your own terms, as much as any body. Who
so petted as you were by your worthy deceased
mother?"</p>

<p>"What! my mother dead?" exclaimed I, both
shocked and surprised.</p>

<p>"To be sure," rejoined the re&iuml;s; "and had she
known where to find you, ere that accident happened,
who doubts that she would have left her
wealth to you rather than to that cross-grained
minx&mdash;pardon my boldness&mdash;your elder sister?"</p>

<p>"All left to my eldest sister?" cried I, drying up
the tears that had begun to flow profusely. "Ah,
if I too had but scolded her all the day long!&mdash;That
at least is a proceeding which shows attention, and,
it seems, meets with adequate thanks. Or rather"&mdash;added
I, on thinking of her ruinous lenity with
regard to my youthful aberrations&mdash;"if she had
but scolded me, when I deserved reproof! But
she is gone to a better place than her son must
hope to see her in. Peace be to my own soul, as it
is sure to be to hers!"</p>

<p>"It would not much perhaps disturb its repose,"

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

observed my companion, "to make a little inroad
on that of your sister, and try, in your quality as
Moslemin, which went furthest, your mother's partiality
or that of the law."</p>

<p>Next to her mother and her husband, Roxana
(now the eldest female of the family) had always
made poor me the favourite object of her ill humour.
I owed her a longer score of petty spites, than I
had hoped ever to pay off. It would have been a
pleasure to me to hustle her out of the inheritance,
had it even been for a stranger. Finding therefore
that the accumulated produce of my mother's estate
at Naxia was in the hands of a merchant in Constantinople,
and in ready cash, I went to claim it.
My sole regret on my way was my not having provided
sacks and porters sufficient to carry away the
whole treasure at once.</p>

<p>There was little occasion for such a hurry. At
first my mother's fortune seemed little easier to
get at than the wealth of the Pharaohs, which my
friend Derwish meant slily to pocket, by displacing
the pyramids. In order to obtain the much-valued
memorial, I found legal forms to go through, certificates
to sign, petitions to present, securities to give,
and accounts to settle, which only allowed me at
the end of several weeks to pocket my money, or
rather the half of my money which had not been
melted away in the interval, in law expenses, merchants'
commissions, presents distributed among men

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

in power, and fees paid to men in office. Even
that half, however, my necessities rendered a most
welcome supply.</p>

<p>To the landed property at Naxia I could only
enforce my right by personal appearance; and a
little voyage round the Archipelago seemed to promise
a pleasing as well as profitable change of scene.
Accordingly I bargained for my passage in a Greek
vessel bound for Ragusa, but which was intended to
touch at Chios. I should thus once more behold,
under the protection of the turban, my home and
friends: and, having gratified that wish, an open
boat could easily convey me, whenever I pleased,
from my father's birthplace to my mother's native
shore.</p>

<p>With all these arrangements settled in my mind,
I sent my baggage on board; meaning myself to go
by land as far as Gallipoli, where the sacoleva<sup id="r140"><a href="#n140">140</a></sup> was
to ballast. Already, with one foot in the stirrup,
was I taking my last leave of all my acquaintance,
collected in a merry circle around me, when from a
distance resounded a loud cry of&mdash;"Stop him, stop
him!" Accordingly I was going to set off as fast as
possible&mdash;cursing the fellow who had girt my saddle
ill, and now detained me to rectify his awkwardness&mdash;when,
ere I could get away, who should burst
through the opening crowd and seize my bridle like
one frantic, but the stargazer Derwish!</p>

<p>"Can you," said he in an angry whisper&mdash;almost
biting off my ear,&mdash;"can you think of going

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

after a paltry rabbit warren, when placed by my
skill on the very threshold of all the treasures of
the universe?"</p>

<p>"Friend," answered I, "accuse the stars; they
have been so dilatory in performing their promises,
that I disclaim all further engagement with their
highnesses."</p>

<p>"Foolish impatience of youth!" resumed Derwish.
"But if hope cannot stop you, at least listen
to fear. For your sake I have spent the whole
night on my roof, watching your perplexing planet.
It looks all spleen and malice. Therefore at any
rate go not till Saturday. Besides, who in his
senses sets out upon a journey on any other day of
the week?"</p>

<p>"Every day is auspicious," replied I, laughing,
"to those who go after their money."</p>

<p>"Hark!" exclaimed the persevering stargazer,
"there is the muezzeem<sup id="r141"><a href="#n141">141</a></sup> of Sultan Achmet, just
calling to prayers. Before you go, say your namaz."&mdash;"I
have said it three times over," replied I.&mdash;"And
the bag of garlic against witchcraft?"&mdash;"There
it dangles from my horse's throat."&mdash;"And
the amulets against the evil eye?"&mdash;"Head, stomach,
arms, all are stiff with them."&mdash;"I see," observed my
friend, deeply sighing, "you have done every thing
for yourself: now do something for me, whom you
desert with all my excavations on my hands. It will
not cost less than fifty thousand piastres only to
undermine the aqueduct, and I have not five paras

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

in the world! Give me at least in advance a couple
of sequins."</p>

<p>Derwish had now completely worn out my patience.
In order to get rid of him&mdash;"This good
gentleman," cried I to the bystanders, "only wants
to deprive the capital of every drop of water. Pray
assist him in this good work, as I have not time to
stop." Derwish at these words grew frightened; he
let go my reins, and slunk away. I rode off, rested
during the heat of the day at a village on the road,
and in the evening arrived at Gallipoli.</p>

<p>The captain having already taken in his ballast,
we set sail immediately. At the Dardanelles the
vessel was detained several hours by private jobs of
the crew, of which the custom-house officers unconsciously
bore the blame. Just as we got under
sail again, an Israelite, who had heroically determined
to go by water whither he could not get by
land, begged admittance. He pleaded poverty so
piteously that no other conditions were attached to
the granting of the favour he sued for, save the
diversion which he might afford. Another jew,
seeing his countryman so readily taken in, begged
hard for the same boon; but the sailors, thinking
they had provided sufficient pastime for the voyage,
now became obdurate, and, when the supplicant attempted
to creep up the sides of the vessel, stoutly
beat him off. In this ungracious operation no one
was more active than his brother jew, who, concealed

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

behind the sailors, gave him with his stick the last
decisive rap over the knuckles, which put an end to
his attempts. I could not help noticing this want
of charity in one who had experienced ours so recently:
but on imparting to Mordecai my feelings
on that subject, I found that he was acting from
the very impulse of that virtue in which I thought
him deficient. The other jew, he informed us, was
an arrant rogue, and, if admitted, no one could tell
what mischief he might do.</p>

<p>We now thought ourselves secure from further
intrusion, when a light wherry, skimming the waters
like a swallow, shot alongside of us, and flung upon
our deck, without even a show of waiting for our
permission, a smart caleondjee, whose high behest
was to be conveyed to Tenedos. The captain
immediately bowed submission.</p>

<p>In this new passenger I soon recognised a personage
with whom I had made acquaintance on board the
Turkish fleet, during the expedition to the Morea.
Never had we met since the failure of the attempt on
Mayno. The consequential marine therefore felt
great pleasure in boasting of the more successful cruise
against the same nest of pirates, undertaken the
ensuing year. The delight with which he described
how the Moohassil of the Morea forced the little
peninsula by land, and the Capitan-Pasha blockaded
it by sea; and how the inhabitants, driven by the
one out of their strong holds, fell with their boats

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

into the clutches of the other, could only be exceeded
by the rapture with which he painted the males all
hanged, and the women and children all drowned,
in order to reconcile them to the Turkish yoke.&mdash;"You,"
he concluded, "who are going to take possession
of your estates, mean henceforth, I suppose,
to lead a sober country life, and have done with all
such frolics. May you prosper! For my part, I
hate innocent amusements, and want a little vice to
season my pleasures!"&mdash;Tenedos now being near,
my friend called for the boat, and got himself rowed
ashore; while I wished him at parting a great deal
of pleasure, with all manner of vice.</p>

<p>The current had faithfully escorted our vessel out
of the straits; but&mdash;having seen us fairly launched
in the open sea, it now made a deep obeisance, and
bade us farewell; leaving our further conveyance
to the care of the winds. These apparently had
business elsewhere: at least, they attended not our
summons; and for several days we were left to confront
a dead calm.</p>

<p>Should any one be so fortunate as to have had
no acquaintance before with the monster ennui, the
most favourable situation without doubt for witnessing
all its powers, is, when on board a small
boat in a sea almost boundless, one lies for hours
watching a cloudless sky for a breeze which stays
away, and a waveless sea for a ripple which chooses
not to come. In this situation, while all else is

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

entirely at a stand, time itself seems to roll on so
heavily, that, though every hour of one's short life
runs wholly to waste, one still wishes that waste to
be more rapid, I who could only exist in a bustle
and thrive in a whirlwind, found myself so completely
weighed down by this obstinate stillness of
every surrounding element, as absolutely to gasp
for breath; to persuade myself that even a sense of
pain would be a welcome relief from so horrible a
tedium, and at last to cry out in an evil moment,
"O for an end to this misery, even by the worst
storm which the heavens have in store!"</p>

<p>Just such a storm happened to be within hearing.
It took me at my word. Scarce had I uttered
the wish, than it hastened with all possible alacrity
to attend the invitation. A white fleece arose
in the distant sky; a dark streak shot across
the furthest wave; a breeze was felt. This breeze
became a gale, and this gale grew to a hurricane.
Angry clouds, gathering on all sides, began to travel
in every opposite direction. They met, they crossed,
and stopped each other as if to parley, until the
whole heavenly vault became a continuous mass of
darkness. It would have been difficult to decide
which howled the most dismally, the frightened
sailors, in the act of lowering the yards, closing the
hatchways, and clearing the deck, or the frightful
blast, while mocking their petty endeavours, and
tearing and tumbling every thing about our ears.

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

It kept lashing the roaring waves, until they alternately
hove us up to the sky, or almost left us
aground at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>When the tempest became so furious that a crew
ten times more numerous than ours would have found
ample employment, each sailor wisely left off his
work, to fall upon his knees, and say his prayers.
Had saint Spiridion, the protector-general of ships
in distress, been ears all over, he scarce could have
heard or have heeded half the vows addressed to him
on this occasion. But the more we prayed the more
the blast increased, until our ship must inevitably
have sunk, had not the sailors at last most providentially
hit upon an infallible expedient for appeasing
the tempest.</p>

<p>The jew&mdash;content with making sport for us most
handsomely on deck during the whole of the fine
weather&mdash;had, at the very first lowering of the sky,
taken care to dive into the hold. Entirely forgotten
for a while, he happened just to be remembered at
this critical period. All now plainly saw the whole
cause of the hurricane,&mdash;but with it also the remedy.
The Hebrew must be sacrificed to appease the angry
waves.</p>

<p>From his very hiding-place the wretch heard his
doom. He strove to creep between the stones of
the ballast: but had he nestled, like a toad, in
their heart, he could not have escaped. He was
dragged upon the deck, to be tossed into the sea.
When indeed absolutely held over the brink of

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

eternity, he begged to ransom his life for that article
of which he had pretended to be entirely destitute&mdash;for 
money; and offered, first, one piastre, then
two, then five, then five and twenty! The sum was
tempting:&mdash;but existence was at stake with the
sailors themselves, and gold had lost its power.
They let the Hebrew drop.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had fancied that the storm began
to slacken,&mdash;wherefore, catching the sinking wretch
by his coat; "Hark ye, palikaria,"<sup id="r142"><a href="#n142">142</a></sup> said I to the
crew, "the question is not what the cheating
scoundrel may deserve; it is only what further
evils we may suffer by bringing him to punishment.
Now, if the mere sight of his uncouth figure is
sufficient to frighten the sea into these fits, what
will she do when his whole ugly carcass&mdash;skin and
all&mdash;is crammed down her throat? Worse&mdash;depend
upon it, than when, on a similar occasion, she threw
up near Sant Irene, amidst fire and flames, a raging
volcano! Let us therefore appease the ruffled elements
by only quietly squeezing the miscreant's soul&mdash;doubtless
composed of good sequins&mdash;out of his
dirty body. In my quality as Moslemin, I fear I
must encumber myself with half the load."</p>

<p>The wind having slackened by this time, the
proposal was approved of by the majority: the
few that looked askance at me were frowned into
silence; and the jew, tossed back into the vessel,
was submitted to our search.</p>

<p>His vest, trowsers, and shirt&mdash;attacked first&mdash;yielded

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

nothing. His enormous leather belt, therefore,
became the next object of our scrutiny:&mdash;and
for fear of losing aught of the wealth its weight
bespoke, we spread a small ihram<sup id="r143"><a href="#n143">143</a></sup> on the deck, ere
we began its dissection.</p>

<p>Scarce was its paunch opened, by the most delicate
puncture which the point of my sabre could
inflict, than out rushed with resistless impetuosity
such a stream of clattering coin, as lasted full five
minutes ere it was quite exhausted:&mdash;but the
highest pieces were paras, and the whole amount
of the heap scarce a piastre!</p>

<p>The sailors turned pale with disappointment:
nor was I myself greatly pleased. "Son of Satan
and of the witch of Endor," exclaimed I with
furious gesture, "do you wish me to treat your own
body like your belt, and to seek for your treasure in
your bowels?" Mordecai was not put to the trouble
of answering; for, on my clawing his head to give it a
shake, his caul remained in my hands&mdash;a positive
musket-proof helmet of conglomerate sequins! I
now had my cue, and it struck me that, where the
head was so well furnished, the heels might also
be worth investigating.&mdash;Like the dirty caul, the
clumsy buskins offered a solid stratum of gold!</p>

<p>As soon as stripped of his pelf, the jew begged
to be killed outright:&mdash;he was worth nothing now!
We thought otherwise. Another vessel hailing us

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

at that moment for some water, we sent two casks:&mdash;in
one of them was Mordecai.</p>

<p>The gale, which had not entirely fallen, soon
carried us full sail into the straits of Chios, and
the distant sound of bells, so long unheard, again
struck my ears. Though now become a Mohammedan,
it affected me with inexpressible rapture.
The impression of approaching home, however, as
it strengthened became sadder. From what I still
hoped to find under the paternal roof, I turned my
thoughts to what I was to find no more. My
mother had not been the wisest of mothers: as a
son I owed her not unlimited gratitude. Instead
of skimming off the dross of my disposition, she had,
by injudicious treatment, only added new alloy to its
ore, and then cast the compound away, as utterly
worthless: yet she had been my mother; and however
lightly all the later ties of choice or of chance
were wont to sit upon my mind&mdash;however often I
may wantonly have broken the social bands of
friendship and of love&mdash;the primary claims of nature
and of instinct seemed, spite of my own reasoning,
still to maintain their roots firm in my heart.</p>

<p>Absorbed in my musing, I found myself opposite
the town of Chios, ere I fancied it in sight.
A boat from the Island soon took me ashore.
When setting foot on the beach, I threw myself
on my knees, with both hands gathered up the

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

loved dust of my native land, and, bringing it with
ecstacy to my lips; "Ah, my own parental soil!"
cried I in a wild rapture; "defiled as thou art by
the tread of rank barbarians, and by the yoke of
ruthless Tartars, still do I bear thee devout worship;
still does thy arid surface more entrance my longing
eyes than all the gilded domes of Eyoob, and all
the gaudy gardens of Sultanieh!"<sup id="r144"><a href="#n144">144</a></sup></p>

<p>As, advancing with hurried steps, I beheld in
quick succession the various spots endeared by the
incidents of my early years, the agitation of my
mind still increased. Here was the corner of the
quay where, with other boys of my age, I used to
watch the ships unloading. There, at the turn of
the street, stood the house in which on St. John's
eve we played at Kleidon rysika.<sup id="r145"><a href="#n145">145</a></sup> little further
on I passed by the abode of our ancient paramana,<sup id="r146"><a href="#n146">146</a></sup>
whose nursery tales I still could listen to with pleasure.
Right over the way my eye fell on the fatal
window whence, at Easter, a whole load of broken
pots and pans&mdash;the wrecks of a twelvemonth&mdash;fell
on my devoted head.<sup id="r147"><a href="#n147">147</a></sup> Ere I had quite done
looking&mdash;with some still remaining fright&mdash;at its
threatening aperture, I stumbled over the steps of the
cross old papadia's<sup id="r148"><a href="#n148">148</a></sup> hovel, whose flesh-pot I filled
one day with glue, in revenge for her complaints of
my prior frolics. I was still inwardly laughing at
the remembrance of her fruitless attempts to unclose
her toothless gums, after tasting her broth, when I

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

grazed the stone seat of a house where . . . . but at
present pass we on! Suffice it to say that out of
the open entrance of this forlorn mansion there
seemed to rush a chilling blast, which, hastily as I
darted by, changed the warm moisture on my forehead
into a cold clammy dew!</p>

<p>In this way did an uninterrupted chain of recollections
carry me on from the water-side to my
paternal threshold. There all seemed solitude and
desolation. The only acquaintance remaining&mdash;the
only being that gave me welcome, was Xeno the
old dog, procured when a puppy from the consul,
and reared by myself. Many a time he had
stood sentinel during my meetings with the donor's
daughter; and when I fled from my home, I had
been obliged to tie him to a post on the quay, lest
he should follow me to the ship, and betray me by
his fidelity. He still seemed to remember his old
master, looked up in my face as if to say, "what
had he done to be thus deserted;" and, wagging his
tail, licked my hand. His joyous yelping brought
down an unknown female of uncourteous appearance,
who asked my business. Having told her its nature,
she desired me to go to the garden in the Campo,
where the signor drogueman at present resided.</p>

<p>The objects I met in my way to the country were
no less interesting than those which I had passed in
the town. But in the one as in the other, I perceived
a change which quite confounded all my

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

calculations. Every thing still stood in the same
place, and still preserved the same shape as before;
but the dimensions of every object appeared totally
altered. What I thought I had left huge, gigantic,
vast as the tower of Babel, now to my infinite
surprise seemed paltry, diminutive, reduced to the
size of a child's plaything. Houses, gardens, hills
and dales, all looked as if, since my childhood, they
had shrunk to half their primitive size. A few
steps brought me to the end of what I thought
covered acres; and what formerly I fancied reared
its head in the sky, now hardly rose out of the
ground. I had left my home, impressed with the
magnitude of every object: to the first images imprinted
in my memory, I had assimilated all the
vaster scenes which I had since beheld; and only
now I first perceived the difference, and from the
comparison, thought what I saw even smaller than
it was.</p>

<p>My long strides soon brought me abreast with a
little man, advanced in years, who was hobbling on
before me. The few additional wrinkles that furrowed
his face could not prevent my recognising in
him the signor Polizo&iuml;, an old friend of the family;
while to his failing eyesight, my change from boy to
man left me an entire stranger. As I must in that
capacity have the more to learn, he seemed to increase
in the same proportion the natural communicativeness
of his disposition. At my request he went regularly

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

over all the members of the paternal house,
until he came to a certain graceless youth named
Anastasius, who&mdash;he informed me in a sort of confidential
whisper&mdash;was the saddest reprobate that
ever had disgraced Chios; insomuch that even he,
Polizo&iuml;&mdash;a primate as he was&mdash;never felt safe from
his pranks, while yet only a mere boy; and if he
met him now, would, he verily believed, die with
positive terror!</p>

<p>Far be from me all suspicion of an intent to commit
murder, in acquainting the old gentleman that
this dreaded reprobate actually stood before him.
Thunderstruck at the intelligence, he stared at me
some time in silent horror; then suddenly wheeled
about, and scampered away. My calling to him
to quiet his apprehensions, till I grew hoarse, could
neither bring him back, nor stop his progress.
Some block of stone I fancy was more persuasive;
for I heard a loud tumble, and would have gone
to his assistance, when the sight of our door drove
all other thoughts away.</p>

<p>I paused a few seconds on the threshold. Signor
Polizo&iuml;'s speech had taught me to expect little kindness;
"and might it not," thought I, "be preferable
to fancy what was best, than to be certain of the
worst?" But <i>that</i> worst&mdash;filial piety suggested&mdash;"I
might make the best by my change of deportment!"
I therefore entered.</p>

<p>As I ascended the steps, and, near the trellis of

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

the landing, caught my father's voice, grown tremulous
with age, my heart began to throb. He was
conversing with his friends, and the ceaseless grinding
of the water-wheel<sup id="r149"><a href="#n149">149</a></sup> in the yard prevented his
hearing my approach. Unprepared, he saw me
stand before him. Perceiving his surprise at the
appearance of one in the Moslemin dress walking
in thus familiarly: "Sir," said I, "you see your
son." At these words my father started:&mdash;yet he
seemed moved, and made a sort of gesture to bid me
welcome; but again suddenly checking himself, as
he caught my brother Constantine's eye eagerly
scanning his countenance: "the sons I know,"
observed he drily, "when they greet me, begin by
kissing my hands: I know none other. Perhaps
you are only come to wrest from them their remaining
property, and to leave me, in my old age, to beg
my bread."</p>

<p>I was going to make the only fit reply in my
power;&mdash;to throw myself on the ground; to kiss, not
my father's hands, but his feet; to beg his blessing,
and to renounce his property: when my ungracious
brother stepped in between the purpose and the
deed, to mar all my good intent. "I made no
doubt," said he in a brutal tone, "that after disgracing
your family by your conduct, you would
also wish to brave it by your presence; but truly you
should avoid the air of Christian houses. It can do
you no good, and to us your breath is pestilence."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

<p>At any other time such a speech would instantly
have been resented. But I felt this the decisive
moment of my life. I stood at the turn between
good and evil. I determined to repress my rising
wrath, though I should choke in the attempt.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I to my father,&mdash;looking earnestly in
his face, while the tears ran down my cheek, "is it
your pleasure that I should be treated thus?"</p>

<p>This unexpected appeal to his feelings seemed
for a moment to stagger my not yet impenetrable
parent. But whether it was that he felt awed by
my brother, who ruled him with a rod of iron, or
that his own heart had entirely ceased to plead for
Anastasius; "Stanco," said he coldly, "is in the
right. You ought ere this to have perceived that
your company is not acceptable. We can have nothing
to interchange with each other. Go, therefore,
and disturb us no longer."</p>

<p>At these harsh words my heart swelled till it was
ready to burst. Lest my enemies should have the
pleasure of beholding me unmanned, I turned away,
and leaned over the stone parapet. Had Constantine
not been by, I should have made another attempt
to soothe my less inexorable father. In the
presence of this unnatural relation I knew it must
be fruitless. Yet I lingered on. I could not bring
myself to depart. I still hoped to be called back.
Alas! I only stayed to hear my brother propose,
in an audible whisper, to have me turned out.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

<p>Turned out of my father's bouse! It was too
much. I rushed away!</p>

<p>Sacred walls of the parental mansion, I call you to
witness! By your moaning echoes denounce me a
wretch to all future ages: be the name of Anastasius
in my native land the name of guilt, and among
foreign nations a title of disgrace, if I entered not
your sacred threshold with feelings of love, of peace,
and of submission! They were rejected: they were
spurned. Let those thank themselves for other
sentiments, who strove to obtain them!</p>

<p>In three strides I cleared&mdash;I do not know how&mdash;the
fourteen steps of the stone flight at whose top I
had lingered; and got out at the gate. Then,
turning round to the unkind habitation, I stopped,
once more to contemplate&mdash;but for the last time&mdash;its
well remembered features, whose former smiles
now were changed into everlasting frowns! "Dear
abode," exclaimed I, "where first I received the
boon of life, too soon become irksome, adieu for
ever! Anastasius shall no more approach thy loved
shade! If he do, may it prove to his perjured soul
the shade of death!" This said, I hurried away, as
if pursued by all the fiends of hell; and in less
than half an hour again reached the town.</p>

<p>Ah! how often does it happen in life, that the
most blissful moments of our return to a long left
home are those only that just precede the instant
of our arrival; those during which the imagination

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

still is allowed to paint in its own unblended colours
the promised sweets of our reception! How often,
after this glowing picture of the phantasy, does the
reality which follows appear cold and dreary! How
often do even those who grieved to see us depart,
grieve more to see us return; and how often do we
ourselves encounter nothing but sorrow, on again
beholding the once happy, joyous, promoters of
our own hilarity, now mournful, disappointed, and
themselves needing what consolation we may bring!</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> visit to my father was not the only fearful
duty I had to perform. Another and more appalling
task remained to be achieved. Of this,
however, the nature was such as no longer to leave
room either for hope or fear. I knew the worst,
and grievously did that worst oppress my heart.
Helena, my first love&mdash;Helena was no more! At
Constantinople, in the heyday of my devotion to
the fair Esm&eacute;, I had heard her mournful fate. The
moment my flight from Chios was known, she made
a full confession. To avoid unavailing exposure,
the consul sent her for change of air to Samos.
There she was attended by one of those nuns of
St. Ursula who, in our islands, double the merit
of their chastity by disclaiming the defence of a
convent. Wretched from the first, Helena, as
the hour of maternal anguish approached, became
every day more impressed with the idea that she
should not survive it. In this persuasion she wrote
me a letter, which she confided to the nun; and
soon became the unhappy mother of a lifeless child.
In conformity with her foreboding fears, or rather,

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

perhaps, in consequence of her apprehensions, she
only survived the birth of her babe a few hours.
The nun had made a solemn promise not to part
with her trust except into my own hands. She
however sent me word at Constantinople that it
only waited my return to my deserted home. Hearing
that she now lived on my own island, and only
a short distance from the town, I went to claim
the melancholy bequest. I found sister Agnes
at home, and alone. The people with whom she
boarded were gone to a neighbouring fair.</p>

<p>The nun had heard me described as a fair complexioned
Greek boy, with a smooth skin and
flowing locks. No wonder therefore that in the
swarthy rough-cheeked Moslemin, with forehead
bare and shaded lip, she should not recognise the
original of her fancied portrait. The first sight of
my fierce figure, standing unannounced before the
lonely maiden, made her start with evident surprise;
but when I showed her a note from Anastasius&mdash;whose
hand-writing, treasured up by her friend,
had met her eye before&mdash;she became more composed,
and gave me the history of Helena's sufferings.
Touched with a sense of shame for the ruin
heaped by my lawlessness upon this innocent girl, I
had determined, while I remained in the presence of
her friend, not to deposit my assumed character, but
to hear the tale of woe to the end with pretended unconcern.
Soon however unbidden tears would start,

<!-- vol 1 page 243 -->

and began to flow so fast, that, for fear of betraying
my feelings I hid my face in my cloak. Even that
could not conceal from the quick-sighted nun the
anguish which throbbed beneath the gaudy mantle.
"I wonder not, sir," said she, "to see you moved.
In truth the story is touching, and calculated to
affect even the stout heart of an Osmanlee. But,
to behold such deep emotion in a stranger! while
the author of so much woe, while Anastasius
himself . . . . ."</p>

<p>Here all control over my tongue forsook me.
"I am that Anastasius," cried I: "could you a
moment doubt it?"</p>

<p>The nun appeared confounded. Shuddering
with horror at finding herself thus unconsciously in
the actual presence of him whom she looked upon as
her friend's murderer&mdash;as little less than a devil incarnate,
a complete fiend&mdash;she darted at me the
gesture of anathema, and to the dread sign added
such dire imprecations, that I could not help
mechanically uncovering my breast, and wetting
it with the moisture of my lips,<sup id="r150"><a href="#n150">150</a></sup> to avert the evil
influence. This action, however, did not prevent
a torrent of more explicit abuse from following
the first vague explosion of anger; and a full
quarter of an hour did sister Agnes rant, and rave,
and curse, ere I could find an opportunity of claiming
the letter I had been promised. With a hand
still trembling with rage she at last took it out of a

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

small casket, and bade me read&mdash;with compunction
if I could&mdash;the last words of my lovely and murdered
mistress.</p>

<p>They were these:</p>

<p>"I neither reproach you with my ruin, which
was my own fault, nor with your want of love,
which was not yours. It depends not on ourselves
to love; but it does to be merciful, and you were
inhuman: you deliberately pierced that heart in
which you were worshipped; and of this deed I
die. On a foreign shore I soon shall breathe my
last, and my wretched father, who expected in me
the comfort of his old age, shall see me no more.
Thanks be to God! The author of my unfortunate
existence shall not have to blush at the sight of his
daughter; nor shall I, wont to look up with the
confidence of innocence, have to avert my eyes with
shame from a parent. For the unfortunate offspring&mdash;I
dare not say of our love&mdash;which perhaps
may survive me, I must not claim a father's care.
You have trod under foot the duties which you owed
her who in the eyes of heaven was your wife, and
had committed no offence except loving you too
ardently. My child will be abandoned to the hands
of strangers; will live in contempt, and die in
misery. But should heaven ever bestow upon you
the pledges of a less ill requited affection, fear, ah
fear lest my infant's wrongs be visited upon them!
Yet, if the last words of a wretch, who is afraid her

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

love will only cease with her life, can find entrance
into your too impenetrable heart, ah, Anastasius!
ah, my Anastasius! repent of your sins, run not
from crime to crime, and revenge not my woes so
severely on yourself, as to render it impossible that
we should ever meet again!"</p>

<p>The time that had intervened between the writing
and the perusal of this letter might already be
counted by years. The fair writer had ceased, not
only to exist, but to be the subject of the public
talk. The guilty boy to whom it was addressed,
revolving years had made a man. The event of
which he was the worthless hero had been forgotten
even in the district where it took place, for more recent
adventures; and the very ink of the admonition
had already become pale. Still did my heart feel
every sentence of the appeal as if yet in all the
freshness of its first inditing. It forgot the lapse of
time, and became filled at once with sadness as
sincere and profound as if Helena's last despairing
sighs still were breathing on my ear. Keeping the
sacred characters pressed to my lips, I struck my
heaving bosom, and flung myself on the floor.
"Here," cried I, "let me lie, and commune undisturbed
with my wretched soul; here let me shed
tears of blood for her whom I first learnt to prize,
when through my fault I had lost her for ever!"</p>

<p>Had sister Agnes known the omnipotence of
mercy; had my penitent, my humble suit been

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

unconditionally granted, who knows what richer
fruits my first contrition might by degrees have
borne? None such were in store for the destroyer
of Helena! The nun, the fatal nun, more impelled
by vanity than by friendship, more anxious
to see my sex humbled than her own exalted, was
not satisfied with my writhing under the reproaches
of my own conscience, unless I also smarted from
the sting of her viper tongue. So keenly did she
sharpen its dart, so many little punctures did she
one by one inflict, so much venom did she pour into
each fresh wound, that resentment at last left not
room for regret, and instead of slowly rising with
resolves of amendment, I hastily started up with
schemes of revenge. A mean ungenerous triumph
over one already prostrate, I swore should meet with
an adequate punishment.</p>

<p>How this was inflicted; how sister Agnes, who
had witnessed the last and direst effects of my unworthiness,&mdash;whose
curses still pursued me fresh and
green, though time had already long faded the less
wrathful farewell of her friend,&mdash;was made to blush
herself; but to blush at my contemptuous forbearance,
let the humbled nun herself explain. All
I wanted was, after the haughty dame had sneeringly
exclaimed, "You of all men!" to be able in
my turn to retort in the same tone, "And you of
all women!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the ill success of my visit to my

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

father, I had not yet given up all hopes of being restored
to his favour. Knowing the uselessness of any
attempt at a conciliatory interview, with my brother
as the mediator, I penned a letter replete with
every possible offer of submission and sacrifice consistent
with my safety as a follower of Islam, and
sent the supplicating words to their destination by
a common friend. Independent of the force of paternal
feelings in the head of the family, I depended
upon the suggestions of policy in the younger
branches. Hatred prevailed over prudence, and I
received no answer. After lingering several days
in fruitless expectation, I at last prepared to leave
Chios.</p>

<p>Ever since the sight of home had revived ancient
recollections, and with them the remorse for ancient
misdeeds, I had panted for a journey to Samos,
there to perform on the lonely grave of my Helena
the sad rites of contrition and of penance. On the
morning of my own birthday I proceeded to the not
far distant island, whose privileged earth held the
sacred deposit; landed on its rocky shore early in
the afternoon, and, ere the evening cast its lengthened
shadows around, reached the hallowed spot, sole
object of my visit.</p>

<p>The sun's departing rays were just gliding from
the moss-grown tomb. I approached it with awe;
strewed upon it the wild flowers which had grown
in its shade, bedewed its silent stones with tears of

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

grief and remorse, and over the ill-fated treasure
underneath, poured out my heart's bitter anguish
in alternate groans and prayers. The whole night
Helena's gravestone was my pillow; and early the
next morning, ere yet the orb of day rose out of the
sparkling wave&mdash;making my dagger my pen&mdash;I
traced on the dusky slab as on a recording roll, my
Christian, my Grecian, my old name <span class="smcap">Anastasius</span>;
filled in the deep sunk characters with the hot stream
drawn from my bosom; and exclaiming: "with
the purple of my own blood I sign the marriage contract:<sup id="r151"><a href="#n151">151</a></sup>
I make thee mine in death, and mine in life
hereafter!" for the last time imprinted my quivering
lips on the cold marble, and rushed away from death's
receptacle, which I had made my nuptial couch.</p>

<p>By this expiatory visit I felt my heart somewhat
relieved. I thought my Helena might, from the
higher regions where she dwelt, have viewed if not
in forgiveness, at least in pity, my tardy atonement;
and with a lightness of soul to which I long had
been a stranger, I proceeded to Paros, and there
spent a day or two with some of my old kinsmen.
Dull stupid islanders as they were, they entertained
me not the less kindly for being out of favour at
Stambool, and when I went on to Naxia, actually
expressed a wish that I might visit them again!</p>

<p>At Naxos reigned supreme, under the wide
spreading wing of Hassan-pasha's all-powerful protection,
my maternal cousin Marco Politi, heir to

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

all the favour enjoyed at the arsenal, before him, by
the papas his uncle, and sole epitrope<sup id="r152"><a href="#n152">152</a></sup> of the Greek
villages that cover the island. From every one of
these individually might this wily and ambitious
personage be said to wage an incessant warfare
against the Latin inhabitants of the city; and if
the Grimaldis, the Giustinianis and the Barozzis of
yore once caused Marco's forefathers to groan under
the weight of the Venetian yoke, amply did Marco
now make the miserable relics of these proud families
pay for the sins of their slumbering ancestors. He
kept them absolutely shut up in their citadel and
towers. Fearful of letting down their draw-bridges
to take a stroll in the fields, they envied their own
flocks of pigeons the liberty of their roamings, and
seemed perched up in their lofty habitations, for no
other purpose than to have a better bird's eye view
of their adversary, leisurely walking forth to skim
the fatness of the land, and going his rounds among
the peasantry, to reap the country's choicest fruits,
and to levy his tithe on its fine wines, its fragrant oils,
and its rich honey,&mdash;while they had often nothing
else to beguile gnawing hunger, but the treat offered
their eyes in the mouldering insignia of their ancestors,
clumsily carved over their gloomy gates.
Such was their dread of Marco's hostility and power,
that, whenever he made a trip to Constantinople,
the whole nobility of Naxos took to their beds, in
expectation of some new avaniah.<sup id="r153"><a href="#n153">153</a></sup></p>

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

<p>Of his own villages Marco was the idol. Like
other idols indeed he was not to be worshipped
empty-handed. But he hated the Latins so cordially,
that it was universally allowed he must feel an unbounded
love for his Greek countrymen. The more,
therefore, in his management of the haratsch and the
other contributions to the Turks, he squeezed out
their inmost substance, the more he was thanked
for his disinterestedness and public spirit. If Marco
had any private foibles, they were, like those of
other great men, deemed more than atoned for by
his public virtues. This was his own opinion also;
and it even appeared, as he observed, to be that of
the higher powers themselves; from the frequent
signal interpositions of Providence in his favour,
and the almost miraculous manner in which his
greatest enemies had been disabled from putting
their wicked purposes against him in execution, by
almost always disappearing&mdash;nobody knew how or
where&mdash;just at the juncture when he seemed exposed
to the greatest danger, or involved in the
most inextricable difficulties.</p>

<p>It was from a kinsman thus mighty and thus
fortunate that, within his own dominions, I, a poor
unprotected stranger, had to claim an estate, which
he called my mother's indeed, but which, for upwards
of five and twenty years, he had taken care to
nurse as his own. My first point for consideration
therefore on landing was, whether I should at once

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

offer to him my unwelcome visage, or first keep myself
in abeyance until I had tried my ground. It
was not exactly the dictates of reason which decided
my conduct. During the conflict in my mind, I
filled, by way of assisting my judgment, a cup of
that delicious muscadel in which, I was credibly
assured, Theseus had on that very spot pledged the
too tender Ariadn&eacute;: but just when in contact with
my lips, the still untasted glass slipped through my
fingers, as the hero did through those of the nymph.
"I accept the favourable omen!" cried I, (to my
Frank readers it might not appear such)&mdash;and resolved
to dare my antagonist at once. "Let me seem
to fear no one," was my maxim, "and some may
fear me!"</p>

<p>Upon this I immediately set out for the village
of Trimalia, where the primate resided. He was
employed with his men in the fields. The day
being sultry, I threw off my cloak in a corner of the
house, and went out with a servant in search of his
master. We found Marco on a little knoll under
an old olive tree, in the midst of his farmers, finishing
his midday meal. He appeared to be eating
with uncommon relish a crust of black barley bread,
and enlarging with great earnestness on its peculiar
excellence and flavour, when my salutation interrupted
the eulogy.</p>

<p>My tone was civil but decided. I told his primateship
that, in conformity to the established custom

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

of informing near relations of especial calamities,
I had thought it my duty to acquaint him with the
misfortune which had befallen me of turning Mohammedan;
and added how very much I regretted
my being obliged, out of respect for my new religion,
to claim my mother's estate, till then entrusted
to his management. This circumstance he
regretted as sincerely as myself; and the more,
when I hinted how absolutely my particular situation
prohibited my disregarding the partiality of the
Moslemin law to its new proselytes; and expatiated
upon the powerful support I was promised by the
Turkish ministers in the task of maintaining my
privilege&mdash;and which, to say the truth, I a little
exaggerated. At the conclusion of my speech, however,
I assured my cousin that I did not think my
obligations to my new creed so very strict, but
that I might consider myself warranted in some
degree to proportion my facility in passing old and
intricate accounts, to the alacrity I found in giving
up the trust.</p>

<p>Much against my expectation, my relation expressed
entire readiness to conform to circumstances.
No exception was taken to any part of my statement.
Nay, my avowed determination to disregard
all opposition seemed rather to increase Marco's
apparent cordiality and frankness. He even pressed
me so earnestly to take up my abode with him,
during my stay at Naxos, that I found some difficulty

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

in handsomely declining the offer. But my
obstinacy was equal to his solicitation, and after fixing
the time the next day when I was to return and
enter upon business, I at last took my leave, and
bent my steps toward the town.</p>

<p>Scarce had I measured three hundred yards,
when I remembered the cloak which I had left
behind. Returning back to the house the shortest
way across the fields, my path led me by the side
of a thick lentiscus hedge, which surrounded the
garden. To this my cousin had by this time retired
with his confidential agent, for the purpose of
more private conversation. As I approached, I
could not help hearing my own name uttered with
such emphasis, that I was tempted to stop, and indulge
for a few minutes in the contemplation of the
beautiful shrubs which formed the inclosure. Meantime
Marco was proceeding with his conversation.
"Cannot you understand," said he to his confidant
(in rather a louder tone than became so wary a
personage), "that if I had attempted at once to
oppose his claim, he would immediately have resorted
to the most effective means for enforcing his
demands; and the world would infallibly have
joined him in condemning my proceedings: whereas,
by admitting his title in the gross, I begin by lulling
asleep his suspicions, gain credit with others for
fair dealing, and then, by every quibble about the
items, and every delay in the forms of law, defeat

<!-- vol 1 page 254 -->

his purpose in detail, and tire out his very heart,
before he gets from me a single inch of his estate?"
This plan of the campaign seemed so well worth a
cloak, however handsome, that I left mine for the
present unclaimed, and wheeling about, went straight
to the town.</p>

<p>But I had my cue for the interview of the next
day. When therefore I found in the course of its
proceedings, that the more Marco explained, the
less I understood, and that certainly I was much
less master of the subject at the conclusion of the
sitting than I thought myself at the opening, I
rather abruptly broke off the conference, and rising,
said in the smoothest tone I was master of: "Hark
ye, cousin; I make no doubt that you have brought
forward every quibble concerning the items, and
equally mean to use every delay in the forms of law,
which belong to so able a diplomatist: but this I
would have you remember, that when, thanks to
its unraveller, a business is become so thoroughly
entangled as to defy the keenest intellect, I know
but of one way to cut the knot asunder; and that,"
added I, pointing to my yatagan, "is with a good
Damascus blade;&mdash;and so fare ye well."</p>

<p>Marco was fonder of diplomacy than of fighting.
He knew his cousin to be a desperate fellow, and
he began to think his agent a traitor. In this
double apprehension he delivered over the whole
concern into my hands; including every deed,

<!-- vol 1 page 255 -->

agreement, bill and receipt, accumulated upon the
estate since the last clearance of the deluge. "What
a thing it is," thought I, "to show a little mettle!"</p>

<p>But I soon found that by mine I had got more
than enough. Many of the transactions relative to
the property, in the way Marco had managed them,
were to me inexplicable enigmas, and this the
scoundrel knew. The moment I was proclaimed
sole possessor of the estate, and sole respondent for
every claim relating to it, there came upon me a
host of creditors of every description, from the
bishop who had witnessed my mother's will to the
Moiro-logistri<sup id="r154"><a href="#n154">155</a></sup> who had wept at her funeral, all of
whom I verily believe Marco had kept back on purpose
for the occasion. With this posse constantly at
my heels I did not know which way to turn myself.
My cousin Marco meanwhile was all at once become
so very discreet as to decline interfering even in
the smallest trifle, or offering his opinion on the
simplest question, until he had the satisfaction of
seeing me fairly worn out with business and with
perplexity. He then ventured to suggest that the
science of accounts did not seem to be the acquirement
most congenial to my disposition, and proposed&mdash;but
with the sole view of relieving me&mdash;to take
over the estate entirely, for a round sum of money.
Convinced, by this time, that every fresh step I took
in the management would only lead to fresh confusion,
I was become vastly more tractable, and so,

<!-- vol 1 page 256 -->

after a little demur, agreed to have the property
valued. This was done by arbitrators, all so very
liberal in their concessions on my part, that the
estate was estimated at about half its real worth.
But this half was tendered in ready cash; and taking
into consideration what most men who drive close
bargains seem entirely to overlook,&mdash;the waste of
time, temper, and breath, in standing out for more
than is willingly conceded,&mdash;I accepted the sum
offered, signed the proper receipts, put my capital
into my bag, and took leave of Marco to return to
the town.</p>

<p>Whether or not I might think the money too
little to take, Marco evidently still thought it too
much to part with. Most kindly he had stationed
two of his trustiest myrmidons in a narrow lane only
just outside his gate, in order to rid me of the burthen
as soon as possible. At my going he so earnestly
recommended the utmost caution, and so pathetically
lamented the unsafeness of the path, that
it struck me he must have good authority for his
surmises, and considered I could not show my sense
of his solicitude more effectually, than by avoiding
altogether the road to which he gave so ill a
character. Accordingly I waited not even till I
was out of my cousin's premises, but, as soon as out
of his sight, jumped nimbly over a hedge, and soon
got entirely clear of his outpost. I might never
have more than surmised the favour intended for me.

<!-- vol 1 page 257 -->

had I not learnt all the particulars of the scheme
the very next day from his own deputy. This
worthy person, having been drubbed by his master
for not stopping me, came to demand a compliment
for the civility of his forbearance. "Then you
really saw me pass by?" said I to him. "Yes."
"And intentionally permitted my escape?" "No
doubt." "Nor let me go home unmolested, only
because you could not help it?" "No indeed."
"If so," exclaimed I, "heaven forbid I should
encourage disobedience in servants! You were sent
by your principal to rob me, and you ought to have
done as you were bidden. Here is all the compliment
I can in conscience make." Upon which I
gave the fellow a second drubbing, and desired him
to inform his master of my proceeding: but this he
neglected.</p>

<p>From that day forward, however, I thought it
prudent not to take long walks by myself in the
country; nor to put the obedience of my cousin
Marco's servants a second time to the test. I remained
chiefly among the Latin inhabitants of the
castle, until a conveyance should offer for some
other place, which only seldom occurs in an island
destitute of harbour, and rarely visited by ships.
But my time hung far from heavy upon my hands.
I was treated among the Catholics, in my quality
of Moslemin, with very great deference. The
chancellor held my stirrup; the fiscal lit my pipe;

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

and die archbishop&mdash;an entertaining old capuchin&mdash;used,
when I went out, to mumble prayers in his
chapel for my safe return. I paid these civilities in
Constantinople news. What I brought not I made;
but this only rendered it the more novel and acceptable.
All I regretted was occasioning a schism
between church and state. I had spread the report
of a secret correspondence between the Grand Signor
and the Pope on an intended conversion of the former
to the Catholic faith; and upon this the chancellor
and the archbishop quarrelled who should
sign the address of congratulation. Before the
question was decided, a khirlangitsch<sup id="r155"><a href="#n155">155</a></sup> of the Admiralty,
which had spent the summer in a fruitless
chase of the Maltese corsairs, cast anchor at St.
Mary's in the neighbouring island of Paros, and
induced me to take my departure. Just on setting
out, however, a perhaps too fastidious scruple arose
in my mind. I did not like to go without making
my cousin Marco some acknowledgment for his
last mark of attention, however unsuccessful it had
been. Five or six honest lads were come from the
khirlangitsch to fetch me away in their boat. With
a handful of Marco's own piastres I made it worth
their while to convey to the primate my leave taking
in the most cordial manner. But as my cousin had
taught me by his example how necessary it is for
the master's eye to watch delicate commissions, I
superintended the business myself. From the high

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

bank of the lane which led to Marco's fields, I had
the satisfaction not only of seeing my relation
soundly bastinadoed, but of condoling with him as
pathetically as he had done with me, on the unsafeness
of the path. This performed, ere he had time
to get up and to crawl home I bid him adieu, scampered
away with my associates to the boat which lay
waiting under a cliff only a few hundred yards off,
and was rowed to Parecchia. From that port I got
in a few hours, across the mountains, to St. Mary's,
and on board the khirlangitsch.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cutter which touched at Paros so conveniently,
was on its way to receive the annual contribution
of part of the circumjacent islands, and
was to finish its cruise at Rhodes. This destination
perfectly suited my purpose. In want of occupation,
and without any precise aim, Rhodes promised
a scene of interest to which I hastened with pleasure.</p>

<p>As my former connexions with the arsenal gave
me a certain predilection for whatever belonged to
the navy, I speedily formed an acquaintance with
one of the tchawooshes of the Capitan-Pasha, who
like myself was only a passenger. Aly was his
name, and Crete his country. This latter circumstance
added much, in my eyes, to the merit of his
society. The Turks of Candia, by their constant
intermarriages with Greek women to whom they
permit every latitude of worship, become divested
of much of their Mohammedan asperity, and Aly,
himself half a Greek, was not entitled to any great
prejudice against me for being only half a Turk.
In the refinements of his toilet, however, Aly tchawoosh
might be considered as a finished Osmanlee.
Nothing could exceed the exquisite taste of his

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

apparel. His turban attracted the eye less even by
its costliness of texture than by its elegance of
form. A band of green and gold tissue, diagonally
crossing the forehead, was made with studious ease
completely to conceal one ear, and as completely
to display the other. From its fringed extremity
always hung suspended like a tassel, a rose or a
carnation, which, while it kept caressing the wearer's
broad and muscular throat, sent up its fragrance to
his disdainful nostril. An hour every day was the
shortest time allotted to the culture of his adored
mustachios, and to the various rites which these
idols of his vain-glorious heart demanded,&mdash;such as
changing their hue from a bright flaxen to a jetty
black, perfuming them with rose and amber, smoothing
their straggling hairs, and giving their taper
ends a smart and graceful curve. Another hour
was spent in refreshing the scarlet dye of his lips,
and tinting the dark shade of his eyelids, as well
as in practising the most fascinating smile and the
archest leer which the Terzhana<sup id="r156"><a href="#n156">156</a></sup> could display.
His dress of the finest broadcloth and velvet, made
after the most dashing Barbary cut, was covered
all over with gold embroidery, so thickly embossed
as to appear almost massive. His chest, uncovered
down to the girdle, and his arms bared up to the
shoulder, displayed all the bright polish of his skin.
His capote was draped so as with infinite grace to
break the too formal symmetry of his costume.

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

In short, his handjar with its gilt handle, his watch
with its concealed miniature, his tobacco pouch of
knitted gold, his pipe mounted in opaque amber,
and his pistols with diamond-cut hilt, were all in
the style of the most consummate <i>petit ma&icirc;tre;</i>
and if, spite of all his pains, my friend Aly was
not without exception the handsomest man in the
Othoman empire, none could deny his being one
of the best dressed. His air and manner harmonized
with his attire. A confident look, an insolent
and sneering tone, and an indolent yet swaggering
gait, bespoke him to be, what indeed it was his
utmost ambition to appear, a thorough rake. Noisy,
drunken, quarrelsome, and expert alike in the exercise
of the bow (the weapon of his country), and
in that of the handjar, he possessed every one of
the accomplishments of those heroes chiefly met
with on the quays of Constantinople and the other
principal seaports in the Othoman empire, whom a
modest woman avoids, and to whom a respectable
man always gives way.</p>

<p>Intimacies are soon contracted at sea; and Aly
was too vain to keep up much reserve. He soon
favoured me with an account of some of his adventures!
"My dear fellow," said he one day, "I would
have you know that from my earliest infancy I
always had the most decided taste for idleness; and
this ruling passion of my heart has never ceased
increasing. The only agreeable occupation I could

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

ever devise was doing nothing. Whatever hires
were held out to me by fortune lost all their charms
to my eye, the moment their pursuit required the
least exertion. Not for an empire would I give up
my dear laziness. At the same time, next to doing
nothing, my chief delight always consisted in spending
a great deal of money. Unfortunately I was
not one of the privileged few who can afford to indulge
both these tastes at once. My luck, however,
made me succeed in some little commissions
for the governor of the Canea, which gained me his
good will: and his good will in its turn gained me
an employment, in which I was enabled to enjoy
my two chief conditions of earthly happiness, if not
together, at least alternately. It was that of tchawoosh
or messenger of the Capitan-Pasha. You
know the jolly lives these gentry lead; you also
know the scanty wages they receive: and you moreover
know the splendid figure they are expected to
make. I have always suspected our grandees, so profuse
in their presents to other people's servants, and
so niggardly in their salaries to their own followers,
of having struck a secret agreement with each other,
by which each was to support his neighbour's retinue
instead of his own. It is but justice to us to
say, that we do all in our power to give effect to
this contract; for you cannot but remember how,
at the Terzhana, we lie in wait for every hapless
stranger whose evil stars inflict upon him business

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

with our Pasha; what fees we exact for every
audience he craves, and for every favour he receives.
The utmost produce, however, of the fines levied
in the capital, would but indifferently defray the
expenses of our apparel, board, &amp;c. were it not for
the chance of being each in our turn intrusted with
some lucrative commission in the provinces.</p>

<p>"For my part, I never, till I saw my wishes
fulfilled, ceased praying Allah both morning and
evening, that he might be pleased to whisper in the
Pasha's ear a word in my favour, and make him
employ his faithful servant Aly as his representative
in some lucrative negotiation. The occasion on
which my prayers were granted was this. Certain
Speciote<sup id="r157"><a href="#n157">157</a></sup> adventurers had waylaid a Greek vessel
bound for Ancona, and not yet knowing&mdash;poor
souls&mdash;the difference 'twixt good and evil, had in
the innocence of their hearts sold both cargo and
ship in their own native place, among their own
fellow-citizens, all more or less engaged in the same
primitive sort of profession with themselves. On an
application from the owners of the vessel, I was sent
to Specia to recover the property, and to bring to
justice the culprits. We gentlemen of the short
dress carry little ballast, and when we have a prize
in view, know the value of time. I no sooner had
received my instructions than I hoisted my pennant,
and set sail. Not that my journey was quite as
expeditious as my departure was prompt. Ships at

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

sea sail not always as the crow flies. Besides, one
has often to seek a conveyance, as chance may offer
it. In addition to which, I thought it would be
showing a proper respect for the grand Admiral
my patron, to represent his person in some of the
smaller islands on my way. This cost him nothing,
nor me either. Every where I found board and
lodging gratis. I was made welcome to all the
necessaries of life,&mdash;among the foremost of which I
reckoned its superfluities,&mdash;and, at my departure,
never failed to receive a small present for the honour
conferred on the place; for which I always took
care, in return, to promise my protection.</p>

<p>"By my deliberate mode of proceeding, I gave
the fame of my approach time to precede me to
Specia: for I did not wish to take any unfair
advantage of its inhabitants, by coming in upon
them unawares, and before they had had sufficient
leisure to prepare for my reception. The island is
so small, and its population so scanty, that, but
for some little management of this sort, I could not
have avoided stumbling upon the poor wretches
whom I was sent in quest of, at the very first step;
and this, considering how essential it was to them
to avoid my sight, would have been most unhandsome.
Such was the confidence which I inspired
by the humanity of this proceeding, that the plunderers
of the merchantman did not even seek concealment
on the news of my actual arrival, but

<!-- vol 1 page 266 -->

treated me with an openness of behaviour quite
equal to my own. To have taken advantage of
such frankness of conduct I must have been callous
to all liberal feelings. As the rogues assured me
therefore upon their honour, that they had already
ate and drank three-fourths of the produce of their
prize, I only exacted restitution of the fourth which
remained. Not wishing, however, to mortify my
employers by restoring to them so small a portion
of their property, I put it into my own pocket.
My conciliatory spirit gained me universal esteem;
and the inhabitants&mdash;all more or less liable to the
same errors&mdash;showered upon me from all quarters
presents of all descriptions; sheep, kids, fowls, and
other live, as well as dead stock. Just as I was
considering to what market I should carry my perquisites,
this vessel hove in sight. I thought the opportunity
a good one for disposing of my provision
and my person; and thence it happens that you
find me going onward to Rhodes, instead of returning
back to Constantinople."</p>

<p>"And do you not fear," said I, "that the grand
Admiral may some day discover your exploits?"
"No," replied the Candiote. "He lays his account
with them beforehand. He knows he cannot furnish
his hall with forty or fifty strapping fellows
stiff with gold lace, and ready to break their necks
at his nod, for nothing but a miserable dish of
pilaff; and like a man of sense, he suffers his Greek

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

subjects to maintain fellows, by whom they think it
an honour to be soundly cudgelled."</p>

<p>A young sailor boy of the district of Sphachia<sup id="r158"><a href="#n158">158</a></sup>&mdash;whose
inhabitants consider themselves as the only
descendants of the ancient Cretans, and are shepherds
in their mountains half the year, and pirates
at sea the other half&mdash;stood by, listening to Aly's
narrative. "You Sphachiote scoundrels," added the
tchawoosh, turning sharply upon him, "may thank
your stars that your Sultana is fond of your cream
cheeses. Many a well deserved avaniah does her favour
save you from&mdash;you and your blessed malkian&eacute;,<sup id="r159"><a href="#n159">159</a></sup>
The last gentle correction you had, I think, was in
the Russian war, when the expedition from the
Canea left not a soul alive in any of your villages."</p>

<p>"Found none to kill, you mean;" answered the
boy. "Our men were on board the Russian vessels,
and our women and children in the mountains with
their flocks. This you knew, or you durst not
have come."</p>

<p>Aly began to knit his brow,&mdash;and the more, as
he saw me entertained. Wishing however to prevent
a quarrel: "who," cried I laughing, "ever
wants a broken head, that can get plunder without
a scratch on his little finger? For my part I always
prefer marauding when the owner is from home;
were it only to save the goods from being knocked
about."</p>

<p>In this sort of conversation passed away our time,

<!-- vol 1 page 268 -->

until we came in sight of the island of Scyra.
"What have we here?" cried I. "A town like a
sugar-loaf, built on the model of a Derwish's cap;
with the church at the top, by way of a tuft! It
must be strange enough to step from one's garret
into one's neighbour's cellar!&mdash;Though I should be
afraid that a walk, begun on two legs, here might
end on all fours."</p>

<p>"This happens the oftener," observed Aly, "as
the inhabitants are by disposition stately, and fond
of strutting about in long robes, in which the unevenness
of their ground often makes them get
entangled. Surely you must know that Scyra is
the great nursery of men and maid servants of Pera.
Two sacolevas, loaded only with this article, go to
the capital regularly every year; and no Scyrote
returns home till he can live on his island in comfort.
This comfort consists in milking their goats and
grinding their barley in all the cast-off finery of
their former masters and mistresses, with feathered
heads, and furred tails. When they meet, they
treat each other with the forms and ceremonious
language of people of quality. The first time I
visited the island, I witnessed a salutation in the
street between two ladies whom I took for princesses.
It begun very well, but it ended with one being
rolled in the mire by a jackass, and the other riding
away upon a pig, which had got entangled among
the folds of her trailing drapery."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

<p>The captain of our khirlangitsch had to receive
the contribution of the little islet of Serpho. On
going ashore for that purpose, he proceeded straight
to the hospice of an old capuchin. A sort of attraction
subsisted between these two gray-beards.
From the heaviness of their intellects, I suppose it
was only that of gravitation; for it ended in mere
bodily juxtaposition, and scarce ever was a word or
idea interchanged. Still did its constancy give their
mutual regard quite a romantic air. Nowhere but
in the friar's dingy cell would the Bey receive in
state the salutation and the tribute money of the
Greek primates, whose troop presently made its
appearance. All its members had their hands
crossed on their stomachs, and their features composed
into as demure a form as possible. The whole
Greek community of the island, men, women, and
children, formed the long train of the procession.</p>

<p>No sooner was it arrived within hearing of the
Captain, than the Coryph&aelig;us of the party stopped
short, hemmed, coughed, and commenced his harangue.
With singular aptitude of simile he compared
the whiskered Bey to an angel of light, and
with equal consistency he besought him not to
diffuse darkness over the land, by exacting a contribution
which its inhabitants could not pay. The
pleas for exemption consisted in a catalogue of
calamities, of which pirates, floods, short crops,
earthquakes and conflagrations were the least!</p>

<p>"All <i>that</i>, gentlemen," answered the Bey in his

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

Barbaresque idiom, fetching a sentimental sigh,
"no doubt very true and very miserable; but, sun
set, you no put tribute here,"&mdash;and he pointed to
his pouch&mdash;"me put bastinado there," added he,
pointing to their backs.</p>

<p>At these appalling words, the whole troop, epitrope
and commoners, joined in a full chorus of
lamentations. When they could squeeze out no
more tears, they beat their breasts, and uttered the
most piteous groans. Finding all this of no avail,
and the Bey as obdurate as ever, they at last retired,
hanging their heads, and like men led out for
execution.</p>

<p>The sun was still above the horizon when the
troop returned, with faces as dolorous as before.
They only brought half the sum required; affirming
with greater oaths than ever, that if they were
to be pounded in a mortar, they could not produce
another aspre.</p>

<p>"Me believe, that," said the Bey, "and me
therefore sorry me obliged to perform my promise.
Me however begin with signor epitrope, in due
respect for his rank. Him me not dare give less
than fifty strokes. Up with his lordship's heels!"
added he, turning to one of his attendants, "and
begin."</p>

<p>All now cried out for mercy, and swore that, if
but allowed five minutes more, they would try to
bring the complement, were they to wrest it from
the bowels of the earth.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

<p>The Bey assented, and the troop again retired;
but it was only to make a full stop at the first turn
of the road, and there to lug out from under their
cloaks the entire sum demanded, neatly tied up in
bags. With this reserve they returned, and delivered
it. The Bey made the proper apologies to the epitrope,
and the party was dismissed.</p>

<p>They now in a close phalanx walked slowly home,
with the most dejected and miserable look; but
they had not gone a hundred yards, when they met
some friends returning from a wedding, preceded
by music. Both parties stopped, a parley ensued,
and presently the whole of the procession, the epitrope
the foremost, spread out their arms, and began
dancing the rome&iuml;ka! Attracted by the sound of
the instruments, the Bey went to the window, and
beholding the merry scene; "Mirar papas," said
he to the friar in lingua franca; "mi parler bono,
canaglia senza fede piandgir; ma mi bastonar, mi
far pagar, subito ballar et cantar."</p>

<p>Not quite so gay were my friend Aly's accompaniments,
when our ship lay rocking on the waves
to the music of the roaring winds. On those occasions
there was any thing but grace in his movements
or melody in his utterance. He had not
even a pretension to heroism at sea. The slightest
ruffling of its surface made him as quiet as a lamb.
To his noisy insolent tone immediately succeeded
the most piteous; and subdued look and manner.

<!-- vol 1 page 272 -->

Aware himself how altered a man he became in
rough weather, he used, at the first breeze, to slink
away like the moulting peacock, and conceal himself
in some hole or corner, where he lay speechless
while the motion lasted:&mdash;nor until the sea resumed
its tranquillity did Aly re-appear on the deck.
How glad he was to see Rhodes need not be told.
He almost plumped into the waves in his impatience
to step into the boat. But even ashore, he still
awhile wore a languid look, which made all the
acquaintance he met ask him ironically, "with
what fair one of the islands he had left in pledge
his spirits?"</p>

<p>My reader has already classed me among those
vulgar beings, who take a greater interest in the
living occurrences of the passing day, than in the
dead letter of remote ages. As a Greek, I ever
found but little motive for exultation in any research
which led me to compare the present with the past.
Still, I had learnt&mdash;where, I cannot tell&mdash;that Rhodes
belonged not to the Turks from the days of the
deluge; that it had once obeyed a Christian order
of knighthood, of noble blood, high spirit, enthusiastic
devotion, and undaunted bravery; that a
handful of these valiant warriors had defended it an
entire twelvemonth against the whole force of the
Othoman empire; and that the Moslemen at last
only found an entrance to the citadel over the bodies
of its brave defenders, fallen, to the last man, in the
long contested breach.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

<p>The outside of the ancient fortress&mdash;once the
chief theatre of these brilliant and bloody achievements&mdash;might
be seen from every part of the quay,
towering high above the modern city. Its wide
ramparts, its lofty bulwarks, its crested batteries of
a black and rugged stone, deprived as they now
were of the once thundering engines of fire and
destruction, looked like the silenced crater of an
extinct volcano, still frowning upon the fertile plain
below, though its devastating powers are no longer
feared.</p>

<p>"Let us go," said I to Aly, "and examine this
object of so much strife, which Osmanlees knew how
to wrest from the hands of the infidels, but know
not how to preserve from the injuries of time."
"Let us go," echoed Aly, who expected some opportunity
to play the tchawoosh: and accordingly
we went.</p>

<p>Though now thrown open to all, the formidable
enclosure still seems guarded by an invisible power.
Few ever enter its precincts; and, on passing its
massy gates, I felt struck with inexpressible awe.</p>

<p>Monuments that already have been so long
in a state of progressive decay, as less to retain
the regular forms of art than they resume the
ruder semblance of nature; as to offer less of a
mode of existence gone by than of a new one
commencing; less of lapse into death than of return
to a different shape of life; less of dissolution

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

than of regeneration: as again on all sides to let in
through their crumbling walls the broad glare of
day; again every where to show their mouldering
joints clothed in fresh vegetation, and again, at
every step, to display their mazy precincts tenanted
by the buzzing insect, and the blithe chirping
bird,&mdash;such monuments have their gloom irradiated
by at least an equal portion of gaiety; and resemble
the human frame so entirely returned to its original
dust, as to preserve no trace of its former lineaments,
and only to break forth afresh from its
kindred clay, in the shape of plants and flowers
more luxuriant and more gaudy.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But edifices, whose abandonment by man has
been so recent that they still bear about them all
the marks of death and mourning, still preserve
undiminished their funereal darkness, still remain
the uninvaded property of solitude and silence; that
their outlines scarce are indented by the sharp tooth
of time, or their surface varied by the softer impressions
of the weatherstain; that their precincts offer
not yet the smallest transition from entire unmixed
death and dereliction, to a new modification of life
and a new order of inhabitants; that they say in
distinct terms to the beholder: "It was but yesterday
we still resounded with the din of business,
and the song of joy,"&mdash;such edifices preserve their
sadness unaltered; they chill the sense, oppress the
heart, and make the blood run cold: for they

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

resemble the human body just abandoned by the
vivifying soul; just stiffened into an insensible and
ghastly corpse; just displaying the first awful signs
of fast approaching corruption.</p>

<p>And of such mansions was composed the scene
before me. The broad square, the stately palace,
the solemn chapel, once re-echoing with the clang
of arms, the bustle of trade, the boastings of youth,
and the peal of devotion, looked as if the blood
scarce was clotted which had stained their massy
walls, and the sounds still must vibrate in air,
which had circulated through their lofty passages;&mdash;as
if one still might discern at a distance the dying
voices of their departing tenants: though the death-like
stillness of the nearer objects was only broken
by the plaintive murmur of the pensive turtle dove,
nestling in the jagged battlements, or the measured
bounds of some stone, slowly severed from them
by the hand of time, and dropping with hollow din
through the yawning vaults.</p>

<p>Contemplating the great names, the sadly eventful
dates and the proud armorial bearings, still
shining in marble of resplendent whiteness on the
black honey-combed walls, like the few memorable
persons and periods that still continue to soar
in light among the general obscurity of times long
past: thinking on the noble ancestry, the high
blood, the martial character, and the monastic life
of the illustrious youth&mdash;the flower of Europe&mdash;whose

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

abodes, whose history, and whose habits
these monuments so clearly marked, I experienced
a new and hitherto unfelt emotion. I envied the
heroes who, after a life of religion, of warfare,
and of glory, slaughtered in the very breach they
defended, now slept in peace and renown, leaving
after them names ever young and ever flourishing
in the hearts of grateful Europe. I wished
that I too had been among these noble few; that I
too had sprinkled these edifices with my heart's
fullest tide; that I too had fallen in these ramparts,
and had filled these yawning chasms with my body.
In the enthusiasm of the moment I wished that I
too might now be nothing more than a spirit; but
a spirit entitled to haunt this august spot as the
scene of my past achievements, and to say to other
inferior and wondering ghosts: "Here I lived, here
I died, here I immortalized my name!"</p>

<p>Disposed, by the comparisons which these ideas
suggested, to repine at my own country, condition
and parentage, I sat down on the prostrate trunk of
a pillar; and there lamented the hard lot of man,
who, so far from being able to adapt his circumstances
to his faculties, is often, with a spirit equal
to the highest station, left to linger in the lowest. In
my despondency my eye caught a piece of broken
marble, gorgeously emblazoned with chivalresque
insignia:&mdash;but, if the side which lay uppermost displayed
the plumed crest of a Gothic knight, the reverse

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

still bore the remains of an Hellenic inscription.
It was a work and a record of the ancient Greeks,
and had no doubt been brought from the opposite
shore, where the ruins of Cnidus furnished the
knights of Rhodes with an ample quarry for the
monuments of their feudal vanity. At this sight, my
own national pride returned in all its force. "And
does it then belong to me," cried I,&mdash;the dormant
energies of my mind all again aroused and starting
up&mdash;"to envy the borrowed greatness of Goths
and barbarians, only able in their fullest pomp
to adorn themselves with the cast-off feathers of my
own ancestors! Am I not a Greek? And what
Grecian blood, even where remotest from the source
and running in the smallest rills, is not nobler than
the base stream that flows through the veins of these
children of the West, whose proudest boast it is to
trace their names to the obscurity of ignorance and
the night of barbarism; whose oldest houses only
date as of yesterday, and whose highest achievements
are the exploits of savages!"</p>

<p>My friend Aly was not a person to sympathize
with my feelings on this occasion. From his very
first entrance into this dark abode, his mind had misgiven
him. Turning as pale as if again at sea, and in
a storm, he cried out: "What can you mean to
do among these ugly ruins? The place is too dreary
even for an appointment with a Goule." All the
time during which I stood considering the various

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

objects that successively attracted my attention, he
had continued most impatient to return; and when,
after my first round, he saw me sit down composedly
on the old broken pillar, there to follow up at leisure
the train of my reflections, he fell into complete
despair. "What can this confounded son of a
Greek jabberer be muttering to himself, as if possessed,"&mdash;I
overheard him say,&mdash;"and that in a
place where people should keep calling to each other
with all their might, in order to frighten away evil
spirits?" and after various surmises, it seemed he at
last settled it in his mind, that I was brewing some
incantation, and going to treat him to a dance of
spectres. At this idea his teeth began to chatter;
he looked round for a way by which he might
escape; but, after several trials, all equally abortive,
he at last convinced himself as well as me, that he
had not the courage to retrace his steps alone.</p>

<p>The only thing left for him to do, therefore, was
to exert his utmost arts of persuasion, and prevail
upon me to bear him company. Ere his fear had
risen to its highest pitch, he had ventured for a moment
to quit my side. He now became so pressing
to show me what he had seen on that occasion, and
was pleased to call the prettiest prospect imaginable,
that at last I consented to follow him, merely to
get rid of his importunities; but fully expecting to
be shown some dunghill, or burying-ground, or other
object equally extraordinary and agreeable. My

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

surprise therefore was great, when, from a projecting
bastion, I really beheld a most delightful view of the
city's gay and busy suburbs, stretching with their
gardens full of orange and date trees, along the
winding beach.</p>

<p>"There now!" cried Aly in a coaxing tone, on
perceiving the bait to take, "who in his senses would
stay another moment among these black and frightful
dungeons&mdash;in which all the company I could
start consisted of as sociable a party of vipers and of
scorpions as one would wish to join,&mdash;that had the
faculty to go and investigate all the innumerable
species of delight contained in that knot of little snow-white
fairy dwellings down below?" and hereupon
he began to enumerate on his fingers such a wondrous
list of all the good things of this world, which
might probably be found in the aforesaid habitations,
that my own mouth, by degrees, watered at the
catalogue; and, to Aly's inexpressible satisfaction,
I at last took him under my arm, and left the castle
to explore the beach.</p>

<p>My curiosity was soon satisfied, but my newly
acquired taste for travelling only received fresh excitement.
From our conversation by the way, Aly
had given me a longing desire to visit Egypt, to
which country I had now performed more than half
the distance from Constantinople; and the commander
of the khirlangitsch had raised that desire to
the highest pitch, by his description of the advancement

<!-- vol 1 page 280 -->

which I might hope for in the land of the
Mamlukes. "Egypt," he observed, "always was
the cradle of revolutions and the patrimony of
strangers; always welcomed the wanderers who had
no predilection for any particular soil, or attachment
to any particular home.&mdash;At present more than
ever," he added, "it holds out irresistible attractions
to the bold adventurer, who seeks his fortune in strife
and confusion. To external appearances, indeed,
the country slumbers in the profoundest peace. No
one would guess, on a superficial glance, that the
least convulsion threatened to disturb its tranquillity.
The utmost wish of the two parties who divide the
supreme sway seems thus far confined to measuring
each other's strength, and watching each other's
movements with the eye. But this apparent serenity
is only the calm which precedes the storm. The
various elements, all preparing soon to fall asunder
and to assume new combinations, are ready at a
moment's warning to burst out into open strife,&mdash;uncertain
when the trump of war may sound as the
signal for battle. Meanwhile each party most eagerly
seeks to increase the number of its adherents by
every new sword's-man of tried enterprise and courage,
disposed to embrace its cause. Under these
circumstances a youth who like you,&mdash;Greek by
birth, and Mohammedan from choice&mdash;is already
beforehand half a Mamluke, and, handsome, vigorous
and warlike, still adds to his skill in martial

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

exercises the more uncommon qualification of expertness
in languages and readiness at his pen,&mdash;wields
the hollow reed as ably as the heavy spear,
and can execute a delicate commission as dexterously
as a dangerous mandate,&mdash;is a treasure for which
all must contend. He need only show himself on
the spot, to ensure opposite factions vying which
shall by the most brilliant offer enlist him in their
foremost ranks."</p>

<p>At this tempting picture, I sighed. The Bey
guessed my thoughts. "I see," said he, "what
you want, and I can supply it. Suleiman, one of
the most distinguished among the present rulers of
Egypt, is my particular friend. The number of his
Mamlukes has been extremely reduced by the late
destructive plague. He seeks every means by which
to recruit his house. For this purpose, his kehaya
at Constantinople, knowing the number of ports
and islands I would have to visit, gave me an express
commission to engage for his patron whatever youth
of promise I might find. I have watched you
during the voyage. You are resolute, sensible, and,
as I deem, not likely to demur at trifles; and, if you
like the scheme, I will give you the recommendations
to my old friend which these qualities deserve."</p>

<p>I bowed, expressed my delight at the commander's
good opinion, and accepted his offer. Elate
at the idea of not only soon seeing fruitful Egypt,
but perhaps myself some day shining in its annals,

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

I immediately sought a vessel in which to take my
passage; and embarked the same day.</p>

<p>As the coast of Rhodes receded from my view, my
heart beat high with eagerness and with hope. It
seemed to me as if thus far I had only been trifling
away my existence in contemptible pursuits, and in
a contracted sphere. I was now, for the first time,
going to take a flight worthy the strength of my
pinions.&mdash;Wide views, noble prospects, vast plans of
fortune and of fame, all at once, as if by the drawing
of a curtain, expanded to my enraptured view!</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sacoleva which carried Anastasius and his
fortunes was first to touch at Castel-rosso, there
to take in fire-wood for Alexandria. The captain
seemed to have no acquaintance whatever with the
coast for which we were bound; nor could any of
his crew boast less ignorance; but they all agreed
that Providence was great; and in order to set the
greatness of Providence in its fullest light, they
always kept as close as possible to a shore set
round with hidden reefs, and teeming with avowed
pirates.</p>

<p>On the second day of our departure Castel-rosso
came in sight. We were just going to double the
most advanced promontory of the island, and to cast
anchor for the night behind its projecting cliffs, when
on our last tack there suddenly appeared ahead of
us, close in with the shore, a long dark object of suspicious
form, though the dusk prevented our discerning
its precise nature. It lay on the water
as still as a rock, but it bore all the appearance
of being filled with life. At this sight our caravokieri
grew as pale as a ghost; and all the crew

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

showed equal signs of courage. "A bad way this,"
cried I, "to meet danger! the pirates cannot see
more of us than we do of them: let us at least try
what a show of resolution may effect." And hereupon
I got our whole artillery brought upon deck, and
prepared for a warm engagement. The moment we
thought ourselves within musket shot of the enemy
I gave the signal for firing. "If the compliment
produce nothing else," thought I, "it will at least
make the scoundrels turn out, and show their
strength." Off went our first volley, and after it
every eye&mdash;expecting immediately to see the hostile
boat in the utmost bustle. So far, however, from
changing her position, she deigned not even to return
our salute. Half surprised and half piqued, we
repeat our fire: but our second volley is not more
noticed than the first. Still more amazed, we gave
a third broadside. Even this makes no impression.
But with the seeming shyness of the enemy our own
bravery rises. We now approach near enough to be
within speaking distance, and a fourth time discharge
every gun and swivel into the hostile deck. In short,
we continue incessantly firing, without experiencing
the smallest retaliation, till, by degrees, this very
impassibility of the enemy causes an alarm of a new
species:&mdash;for we now fancied ourselves under the influence
of some spell; we supposed that we beheld
nothing but an unsubstantial vision: we became
convinced that we were fighting only with the

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

phantom of a ship; which presently would either
explode or vanish away&mdash;either blow us up in the
air, or draw us after it into the fathomless abyss.
As however neither happened, and the vessel seemed
equally little inclined to rise or to sink, we at last
agreed that the very few men which she contained
must all have been killed by our very first broadside.
We therefore suspended all further hostilities during
the remainder of the night, purposing as soon as
the dawn appeared to remove the dead bodies, and
to divide the spoil.</p>

<p>The dawn at last did appear, and as soon as it was
sufficiently advanced to light up the scene, showed
to our straining eyes, in the object of the whole
night's strenuous fighting, a small rock in the sea,
which from the peculiarity of its shape actually bears
the name of the Galley. We regretted all the ball
and powder wasted, and agreed not to boast of our
intrepidity: but our modesty was, in spite of our
caution, put to the blush. The whole island of
Castel-rosso had been alarmed by the incessant
firing; every part of the shore was lined with spectators;
and the moment we landed, they all crowded
round our party, and with loud cheers wished us
joy for having silenced the enemy.</p>

<p>Having laden our wood, we pursued our voyage.
It seemed an eternity in duration. Our crew knew
no other mode of sailing than right before the wind;
and the least cloud that arose made them put into

<!-- vol 1 page 286 -->

the first inlet they could reach, wholly heedless of
the risk of splitting upon a rock, or running aground
upon a shoal. Coasting from one headland to
another, we slowly crept round every cape or promontory
on our way; and there scarce exists a
single creek, I believe, in or outside the Satalian bay,
which we did not successively visit. When the wind
increased to what was called a fortuna, the sailors
could only think of praying and lighting tapers
before the Panagia; and as soon as fair weather returned,
they could only dance and play upon the
guitar; nor ever thought of repairing the damage
done to the ship, until reminded of it by a fresh storm.
Still was the first part of our journey, compared
with the latter, the flight of the swallow contrasted
with the creeping of the tortoise. In the latitude of
Damiat, fate seemed to have fixed us to the spot for
life; and we thought ourselves doomed never to pass
the eastern outlet of the Nile, even with the assistance
of some more experienced sailors whom we there
got on board. Every inch the feeble breeze enabled
us to advance, the strong current as regularly drove
us back; so that on our starboard tack we invariably
lost all we had gained on the larboard. Day after
day at sunrise we had the satisfaction to find ourselves
just in the same place from whence we had parted at
sunset the evening before. The fatal mouth of the
stream seemed to breathe a fascination which no
earthly power could overcome!</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

<p>An a&euml;rial one at last flew to our assistance. It arose
on the fifth day of our vain attempts, in the shape
of a sciroc sufficiently strong to cope with the current.
Backed by the burning blast, we doubled the point
of the Delta in the very teeth of the perverse tide,
and thus approached the goal. Even before we could
discern the sandy shore on which it stands, we beheld
the town of Alexandria, crowned with minarets and
encircled with date trees.</p>

<p>In its quality of Grecian property, our vessel cast
anchor in the new harbour; the old being reserved
for stanch Musselmen keels. Hell itself, as the
bourn of a long sea voyage, would have appeared
to me a very habitable place; Alexandria seemed
heaven. In its melancholy mounds of barren sand
I could only see pleasing swells, and in its dismal
ruins a picturesque ruggedness. Its inhabitants,
ready to assume any hue or form at will, were a sort
of human chameleons: but chameleons may afford entertainment
by their constant changes. To me the
contrast between the liveliness of the Alexandrians
and the solemn stupidity of the Turks seemed quite
enchanting. As I went to secure my night's lodging
at an okkal,<sup id="r160"><a href="#n160">160</a></sup> I was every instant arrested by their
wit and repartee. "How pleasant it must be to
reside here!" said I to myself. "Gay people are
always so good-natured!"</p>

<p>The words had scarcely dropped from my lips,
when I heard at some distance a loud and increasing

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

clamour, which I supposed to be that of some rejoicing
or festival. Presently appeared an immense
crowd of people of every age and description&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;rending the air with their
shouts. In the midst of the motley assemblage
advanced in a separate cluster a chosen band, trailing
after them in procession, with louder howlings than
the rest, the city weights and scales.</p>

<p>"What means this ceremony?" said I, accosting
one of the actors in this novel scene: "for what
purpose are these instruments travelling?"&mdash;"For
the purpose of gibbeting the chief of the customs, a
Syriac Christian, on the very instrument of his malpractices;"
hastily answered the fellow, impatient
at the detention.</p>

<p>"And has the law weighed, and found him
wanting?"&mdash;"How could it help doing so," was the
reply, "when we all demanded his punishment?
We insisted on the shar-allah,&mdash;the justice of God;
and the cadee himself thought us too many not to
be in the right. So we are going to execute the
sentence."</p>

<p>Having now carried his courtesy to the utmost
stretch, the man bade me adieu, for fear of further
questions, and ran after his companions, who already
were out of sight. For my part, I contented myself
with inwardly praying to Allah that I might
be preserved from his justice; and particularly at
Alexandria.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

<p>My apartment at the okkal being secured for the
night, I went to a native of the place who followed the
various trades of ship agent, interpreter, and pilot, in
order to obtain from him a conveyance to Raschid.<sup id="r161"><a href="#n161">161</a></sup>
In his youth, the bustling personage had served on
board Marseillese, Venetian, and Leghorn traders.
He spoke with equal fluency the Turkish, the Arabic,
the Greek, the Proven&ccedil;al, and the lingua
Franca. On entering his small abode, where he sat
with open door in readiness to receive strangers, I
found him gravely discussing with a Franciscan
monk, over a bottle of rakie,<sup id="r162"><a href="#n162">162</a></sup> the relative merits of
Islamism and of Popery.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, father," said he, speaking with such a
volubility of tongue and violence of gesture, that at
first I thought him in a tremendous passion, "I do
not mean to pass myself off for the most squeamish
of Moslemen. In my long intercourse with infidels
(begging your pardon) I have been obliged occasionally
to relax a little from the rigour of our
practices; sometimes, when time ran short, to
mumble half a prayer instead of a whole one; and
where water was scarce, to perform my ablutions to
the wrist only instead of to the elbows; nor did I
always remember, when a good joint of meat was
smoking on the table, and I sharp set in consequence
of a long fast, to inquire before I fell to, whether
the beast had been stabbed with a knife or knocked
down with a hatchet. But, thank God! I have never

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

been a rank heathen&mdash;a kafr. I never, like you,
believed in scores of Gods, nor worshipped idols of
wood and brass."</p>

<p>"Merciful Father," cried the friar&mdash;setting down
the rakie, already in contact with his lips:&mdash;"nor I
neither, nor any of us! How can you say such
things?"</p>

<p>"How can I?" answered the Alexandrian, "but
from having witnessed them with my own eyes!
Who among you, I beg, thinks of celebrating a
festival, building a mosque, addressing a prayer,
vowing a present, imparting a wish, or expressing
a want to any but St. Anthony of Padua, St. Francis
of Assisi, St. John, St. James, St. Peter, St. Paul,
St. Agnes, St. Catherine, St. Cecilia, or any other
of the saints and saintesses, whose interference quite
leaves Providence a cipher, and whose number exceeds
that of days set apart to worship them? In
whose name but in that of these officious go-betweens
are your oxen, and your sheep, and your poultry,
and your very pigs blessed by the priest at the
church door? In whose honour but theirs do you
suspend over your altars silver tokens of broken
heads and hearts, of children born, and grown
people mended? Can your cook so much as bake
his meat, but by favour of St. Laurence?&mdash;delighted,
it seems, to be reminded of his own broiling on a
gridiron! And as to worshipping wooden images,&mdash;
have I not seen whole shoals of Nazarenes leave the

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

nicest, whitest little flaxen-headed madonnas which
your toy-shops could produce, at home quite neglected,
to travel barefoot perhaps five hundred
leagues to some old mouldering figure, as ugly as a
scarecrow, and as black as a negro; which strange
fancy you will allow could only arise from some peculiar
virtue assigned to the latter image,&mdash;since,
how should they otherwise try to extract it, by rubbing
their noddle against its greasy pate?"</p>

<p>"As to that, child," replied the friar&mdash;taking a
fresh sip of his rakie, and pursing up his mouth like
one who is going to give an unanswerable answer,&mdash;"it
is only on the score of superior resemblance
to the saint, that certain images are preferred. All
the world knows that the holy Virgin sat for her
picture to St. Luke: and we may suppose she wishes
to distinguish the originals by some peculiar mark
of her divine favour."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the Alexandrian, in astonishment;
"if this same virgin had been offered to me
as a wife!"&mdash;but again checking himself: "and
pray," added he, "your other saints, have they
also each had his painter?"</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied the Franciscan. "All great
personages with us sit for their portraits. I myself
have sat, both as a Cupid and a friar."</p>

<p>The factor now got up, and fetching a little
parcel which he gave to the padre: "there," said

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

he, "are the St. Domingo beans you wanted. They
are the very best I could find in the market. You
may safely send them to your friends in Christendom,
and be sure that, when well roasted, like
St. Laurence aforesaid, they will drink them for
pure Mokha, and admire how superior they are in
flavour to the vile West India coffee." Upon this,
he slapped the father on the back, dismissed him,
and asked my business. I had made signs to him
before not to break off the discussion, which I
thought rather diverting.</p>

<p>On stating my intention to go to Raschid, he
agreed for my passage on board one of the country
djerms.<sup id="r163"><a href="#n163">163</a></sup> It was to sail early the next morning; and
at the appointed time, I went to secure my berth.</p>

<p>The boat seemed chiefly loaded with live stock;
and by far the noisiest article of that description
was a lot of female slaves, selected from among a
ship load lately brought for sale to Alexandria. A
sharp <i>grego-maestro</i>, which kept blowing in our
teeth all day long, and at dusk forced us to anchor
before Bekier, enabled me to form some estimate of
the value of this cargo. In the small place where
we were all huddled pell mell, the rolling produced
by the storm afforded me every opportunity
I could wish for of forming an acquaintance
with such of the ladies as looked most sociable;
nor did our innocent chit chat suffer any interruption

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

from the watchfulness of their keeper, who,
horribly sea-sick, lay speechless in the hold, and
never opened his mouth for any purpose at all calculated
to interrupt our conversation. His charge,
inured to the sea by the voyage of the Euxine and
the Mediterranean, only laughed at his distress, and,
in defiance of winds and waves, chattered away like
magpies. A Tcherkassian damsel, whose large black
eyes seemed quite determined not to suffer from the
concealment of her other charms, chiefly attracted
my attention. She rewarded my notice with her
utmost confidence, and gave me the rude sketch of
her rough adventures.</p>

<p>"One evening," said she, "when I was in bed,
and pretended to be asleep, my parents began to
talk, as usual, about the trouble I gave them. My
mother wished me far away. My father observed
nothing was so easy as to fulfil that wish. A Turkish
merchant, who used every two or three years to
come and collect slaves in our country, had arrived
that very day; and assuredly it was fairer that
those who had had all the expense, should have the
profit of me, rather than the neighbouring Tartars,
who were every day carrying off some of our girls
to sell to the Turks. My mother&mdash;somewhat fond
of contradiction&mdash;now changed her tone, and would
not hear of parting with her only daughter. But
my father, telling her she was always perverse,
offered her an alternative between what she liked

<!-- vol 1 page 294 -->

better than keeping, and what she disliked worse than
losing me,&mdash;a cask of brandy or a sound cudgelling.
She took the spirits and gave up her child. The
next day I was carried to the merchant. After a
great deal of haggling, he bought, or rather accepted
me in exchange for arms, apparel, and sweet meats.
I was stowed on board a small vessel, with a number
of other slaves picked up in various parts. Most
of them had been sold by their landlords in payment
of rent. The ship proved so leaky that we never
expected to reach Stambool. By a miracle, however,
we got there;&mdash;at least, so I was told: for I never
saw any thing of the place, except the large ugly
khan in which we were housed. Our owner had
us taught here the various accomplishments requisite
for a ready sale&mdash;the Mohammedan religion,
music, and dancing. Every day customers of all
descriptions used to come and cheapen some among
us. The price set on me was what few could afford:
but my time meanwhile passed comfortably. I had
plenty to eat, heaps of fine clothes, and a looking-glass
to myself. I should have been quite happy
but for the dread of being bought for the Grand
Signor, who, they say, has so many wives, that he
does not know what to do with them, and, though
as old as Methusalem, yet must have a new one
every Christmas. Think of being laid on the shelf
at the death of this old spindle-shanks, as useless
lumber, in an ancient seraglio with tremendously

<!-- vol 1 page 295 -->

high walls&mdash;there to remain for life neither single
nor married! This fate I escaped. The kehaya
of Youssoof-Bey of Cairo bought me for his master,
with some of my companions. We were immediately
shipped off in a very comfortable vessel;
hardly ever had a whipping during the whole
voyage; and here we are, on the eve, thank God!
of reaching our final destination. To me it promises
a paradise. I wish I could say as much in favour
of my companions. But, poor things! they were
only, as it were, thrown into the bargain; and I
fear will remain all their lives mere drudges."</p>

<p>This last piece of intelligence, though conveyed
in a very low whisper, did not escape the quick ears
of the damsels for whom Hamida expressed such
unacceptable compassion. I thought it would have
occasioned an immediate engagement. With one
accord the whole party rose up from their mattresses,
and, gathering round the frightened Hamida, abused
her for telling such falsehoods&mdash;she! a low-bred
Tcherkassian, without faith, fat, or manners&mdash;of
Georgians like them, who at home used every day
to go to mass, and had as much victuals as ever
they wished to eat! But Hamida's own mettle rose
at the base insinuation, and facing her assailants
boldly; "It signifies much truly," replied she in
an ironical tone, "from what country we come,
when none of us will ever see it again; and whether
we had much or little of our religion, when we all

<!-- vol 1 page 296 -->

have renounced it alike! And as to our fat&mdash;which
is the most material point&mdash;that must be seen to be
judged of."</p>

<p>"Then, let it," replied all the others in chorus;
"and trust to us for seeing nothing!" and immediately
they all fell upon poor Hamida, forcibly tore
open her feridjee, and displayed her bosom. It
might not answer the utmost amplitude of Asiatic
ideas, but I confess, though I looked hard, I perceived
no deficiency.</p>

<p>Even before this exhibition, the keeper of the
ladies had cast sundry savage glances our way. He
now contrived, sick as he was, to crawl unperceived
among the busy group, and only announced his
presence by unexpectedly laying about him with
such energy as not only to separate the combatants,
but to send them slinking away to the furthest corner
of the hold. He then lay down before them,
and thus formed an effectual mediator for the prevention
of further disputes.</p>

<p>No one remained on the field of battle except the
spectators: namely, myself, and a single female as
different from our Circassian as night is from day:
an Abyssinian negro woman. Manumitted by her
last master, the dusky nymph had nobody to whom
she was accountable for her conversation but herself,
feared not the interruptions of a keeper's lash,
and seemed determined to avail herself to the full
of her advantages. She began by informing me,

<!-- vol 1 page 297 -->

most prolixly, of all her concerns, past, present, and
future. At first, she told me, her stars had looked
but coolly upon her. She had been carried to
Constantinople in winter, had suffered much from
chilblains, and had been married to a black eunuch.
But the husband died, the chilblains healed, the
summer came, and lovers began, like bees, to buzz
about the black rose. "Still," continued she, "as
I now was rich, I resolved again to quit the cold
climate of Constantinople, and gradually to re-approach
the milder temperature of Sennaar. Perhaps,
thought I, in my way, at Alexandria, I may
chance to find among the Mawgarbees<sup id="r164"><a href="#n164">164</a></sup> some proper
husband for my money, to make me amends for
my former empty honours. Nothing, however,
worthy the acceptance of the widow of Ibrahim-Aga
offered; and I am now moving onward to
Cairo, where, wholly independent of your insipid
whites, I am quite sure of suitably matching my own
colour,&mdash;unless," added she, with a significant glance,
"something very tempting should offer by the way."</p>

<p>That this something actually had offered, and
that every objection to the insipidity of whites had
been overcome, I soon felt convinced of by the lady's
<i>oeillades</i>. Certain of her own approval, she did not
in the least seem to trouble herself about any possible
objection on my part; and her advances presently
became so marked, that I owed the greatest obligation
to the timely interposition of the Boghaz.

<!-- vol 1 page 298 -->

This formidable sand-bank, which muzzles the
mouth of the Nile, was announced at a most critical
moment. Immediately every other passion yielded
to terror. The Circassians screamed, the Turks
fainted, and the negress turned as pale as she was
able. Even after the peril was surmounted, all
thoughts of taking the citadel by storm seemed laid
aside; and the siege dwindled into a mere blockade,
which lasted till we got to Raschid.</p>

<p>The abrupt transition from the yellow aridity of
Alexandria to the verdant freshness of Rosetta,
rising on the margin of a beautiful river, and embosomed
in orange, in sycamore, and date trees,
might give a foretaste of Elysium. I spent a
whole day in a jesmine arbour, eating bananas, and
drinking the juice of the sugar-cane; and, after
having thus truly tasted the sweets of Raschid,
re-embarked on board a maash,<sup id="r165"><a href="#n165">165</a></sup> destined to sail up
the river, and to land us at Cairo. It resembled
Noah's ark; was filled with beasts of every description,
and surrounded by an universal flood. As
far as the eye could reach, the waters of the Nile
suffered nothing to rise above their surface but the
walls of the towns and villages, looking on their
artificial platforms, as if floating in trays on the
liquid plain. Among the strange animals which
our barge conveyed across this immense plash,
shone conspicuous from the bright yellow of his
flossy skin, a short bloated biped, who, on a head

<!-- vol 1 page 299 -->

scarce peeping over his shoulders, wore, perfectly
poised, a huge flat turban, which gave the <i>tout-ensemble</i>
the complete proportions of a toadstool;
and truly, in the eyes of the other natives, this
natural production seemed to be very much held in
equal estimation with a fungus. An Osmanlee of
Cairo&mdash;a man of unusual information for his country,
and of open pleasant manners&mdash;seeing the wonder
with which I contemplated this figure, whispered
me: "Coobd is the name these people bear, and
they trace their descent from the ancient Egyptians;
but they have changed the object of their worship
from cats and onions to gold; and the only hieroglyphics
they preserve are those in their scrutoires, which
secure to them the exclusive knowledge of the size,
produce, and boundaries of all the cultivable tracts
of the country. Nor is this, in their hands, a mere
speculative and barren science. It ensures them the
stewardship of all the property of their Mohammedan
masters. More conversant in arms than in
arithmetic, we cannot dispense with this vermin,
though it lives upon our best substance; and every
Moslemin of any rank or wealth, from the Schaich-el-belled<sup id="r166"><a href="#n166">166</a></sup>
who farms the whole territorial contribution
of Egypt, to the smallest Aga of a village, or
subtenant of the Schaich-el-belled, has his Coobtic
steward or writer, whose accounts he understands just
as much as the Coobd understands the language of
his own prayers. He only knows that he is cheated,
and has no way to help himself."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 300 -->

<p>Night, meantime, had begun to cast its veil even
over the nearest objects, when, on a sudden turn of
the river, we all at once beheld at a distance before
us a most splendid spectacle. The left bank of the
Nile seemed for a considerable space in an entire
blaze, and the luminous streak which edged the
winding shore, producing by its reflexion a parallel
line of light in the mirror of the stream, made the
whole resemble a riband edged with fire. It glittered
more brilliantly from the surrounding darkness.
The spot which it skirted resounded with the
incessant clang of cymbals, of kettle-drums, and other
musical instruments; and, as we approached near
enough to discern in the fairy spectacle the effects
of a most extensive illumination, the shouts and
song of innumerable voices met the ear. The place
thus distinguished was Mektoobes, famous in all
seasons for its gaiety, and at this particular period
engaged in the festival of its patron Schaich, which
drew together the population of all the surrounding
districts. For almost a mile the quay was lined
with barges, so closely wedged that one might walk
from deck to deck; while the interior of the town
was rendered as light as day by thousands of lamps;
some winding in lofty spirals to the summit of the
minarets, others thrown in long festoons from pinnacle
to pinnacle, others again expanding in wreaths,
in sheaves, and other fanciful forms. As we drew
nearer the eye was not more dazzled by the glare
of light, than the ear was stunned by the din of

<!-- vol 1 page 301 -->

instruments. At every corner of a street a different
band of musicians played a different tune, in hopes
of drowning all the others in its noise; and in
every open space some different troop of singers,
dancers, tumblers, sorcerers, or fortune-tellers exhibited
their different sorts of feats, with a view
to eclipse all the rest. Here a string of awalis<sup id="r167"><a href="#n167">167</a></sup>
strained their windpipes in tremulous quavers, until
they grew as hoarse as the frogs in the neighbouring
ditches; and there a knot of ghazie<sup id="r168"><a href="#n168">168</a></sup> distorted their
limbs into as uncouth postures as if they had been
frogs themselves; and while one portion of our
passengers stood watching the tricks of a juggler,
whose troop of performers consisted in a basket full
of serpents, another portion sat gaping at the feats
of a rival mountebank, whose <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> was
turning water into blood, and earth into vermin.
I speak not of the female charmers who preferred
for the exhibition of their fascinations the darker
places, where they excelled in emptying of its last
para the closest drawn purse. Of these Syrens, our
poor Coobd might give the best account. He had
been missing almost from the moment we went
ashore; and no one could guess what witchery had
conjured him away, until we all got back to our
barge. It was there he first reappeared among us;
and the first thing he did was to untie his pouch,
in order to ascertain the damage it had sustained.
A sequin was the utmost he rated it at; and that
was just twice as much as, by his own account, the

<!-- vol 1 page 302 -->

thrifty personage ever had spent on similar aberrations.
What was his horror when he found that,
by an art exactly contrary to that of the alchymists,
the ladies whose leger-de-main tricks he had been
too curiously investigating, had converted all his
gold into base metal. His purse indeed, externally,
preserved its full size and weight; but alas, the
contents had experienced a sad transmutation! His
gold was all turned into brass!</p>

<p>At any other period, the adventures of Mektoobes
and the misfortunes of the Coobd would have furnished
materials for conversation till we reached
Cairo: but at this moment the mind of no Egyptian
born was sufficiently disengaged for such idle talk.
A topic of higher, more universal, and more vital
interest engaged every thought, and dwelt on every
lip; absorbed the whole mind of man, woman, and
child; and was sure, whatever other subject most
foreign from it might accidentally be started, ultimately,
by imperceptible steps, to regain full possession
of every receptacle of thought or words!</p>

<p>This was the rise of the Nile,&mdash;the phenomenon
on whose measure and degree depended, throughout
Egypt, the serious difference between plenty and
famine; and whose increase, perceptible inch by
inch, and sometimes rapid, sometimes slow, sometimes
wholly at a stand, kept, while it lasted, every
eye on the stretch, and every mind in a fever.</p>

<p>In vain, as a stranger not yet embued with the
spirit of the universal subject, I now and then tried

<!-- vol 1 page 303 -->

to turn the conversation into another channel. The
slimy ducts that carried the muddy waves of the
Nile to the furthest limits of the country, were the
only channels which my hearers could contemplate.
When I talked of Hassan's expedition to the Morea,
a person on my right observed it must have happened
the year when the river only rose fifteen cubits;
when I hoped to engage the attention of the company
by describing the splendours of the Sultan's
court, a man on my left asked whose office it was to
bring him the daily intelligence of the Nile's increase;
and when I extolled the beauty of our
islands, some one, who till that instant had never
opened his lips, sighed to think they had no rivers
to rise like the Nile. I now despaired of any other
general conversation, and, in order to hear the last
of the ruling topic, took my Osmanlee friend aside,
supplicated as a favour that he would first say all
that his imagination could suggest concerning the
Nile and all its branches, and would then vouchsafe
to give me a little sketch of the politics of Egypt.
This he readily undertook, and as his information
on that subject may render more intelligible my
own subsequent adventures in that country, I shall
here transfer it to the reader&mdash;in substance more
than in form&mdash;and with such additions and emendations
as I subsequently derived from my own observation.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 304 -->

<div class="center" id="v1ch16">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>," said (or said not) my Osmanlee, "after
its conquest by Omar, first obeyed a race of Arab
sovereigns called Kaliphs. To these succeeded, on
its occupation by Selah-el-din, a race of Tartar
princes denominated Sultans.</p>

<p>"It was the early practice prevailing in every
country under Tartar government, to leave the cultivation
of the ground to the free-born peasant,
and to employ the prisoner taken in war, and the
purchased slave, in domestic and personal services
alone. When however in their southward progress
the Tartar swarms came in contact with black and
woolly-haired nations, they varied the destination of
the new slaves they made according to their colour.
The more pliant and pacific negro, foreign in habits as
in looks from his purchaser, was under the name of
Abd or domestic servant confined to household offices,
and was never kept for defence. Admitted to the
highest posts in the household, he could attain no
advancement in the state. The more warlike white
slave on the contrary, not unfrequently the neighbour
nay the relation of his master in the country
whence both derived their origin, and considered

<!-- vol 1 page 305 -->

as more able to wield a patron's authority, and more
fit to represent his person, was, under the name of
Mamluke, trained up to arms as well as to attendance.
While in his master's house, he served him not only
as his domestic but as his military guard and defender,
and when manumitted, he became entitled
to aspire to the highest dignities in the army and the
state. The custom of raising military slaves or
Mamlukes to eminent employments has prevailed
wherever throughout Europe, Asia, or Africa, a
Tartar dynasty has arisen. Indeed, slaves of this
description were employed by Tartar sovereigns as
their generals and their ministers in preference to
free-men, whether of the conquered or even of the
conquering race. Torn up by the root from their
native soil, strangers to that into which they were
transplanted, unconnected with the body at large
either of the vanquished or of the vanquishers, deriving
their existence, their support, their greatness
from their master alone, raised by his will, and at
his nod again reduced to their original nothingness,
they appeared of all descriptions of men the least
formidable to a despotic ruler. In their hands the
power which an absolute monarch is obliged to delegate
in all its fulness to each of his ministers down
to the last and least, seemed most exempt from the
danger of being turned against its author.</p>

<p>"No device, however, has yet been discovered by
which a single hand can long continue to hold undivided

<!-- vol 1 page 306 -->

an absolute sway over an extensive country.
He who must singly withstand the pressure of many,
is doomed at last to fall. Thus it fared with Selah-el-din's
successors. The Mamlukes intrusted by
them with the command of provinces, amended their
original insulation by their subsequent leagues.
They set aside their legitimate sovereign, and established
a military government in a republican
form. Each of the fourteen provinces of Egypt
was governed by its own Bey. These lesser chiefs
used to assemble in council under a president called
Schaich-el-belled, or chief of the country. In this
Divan were enacted by plurality of votes the decrees
for the common welfare of all, and each Bey presided
in his own department over their due execution.</p>

<p>"From its first origin and throughout all its later
vicissitudes, this republic of Beys has been perpetuated
by means unexampled to the same extent
in any other country,&mdash;namely, by an uninterrupted
importation of strange slaves, transformed by degrees
into rulers of Egypt. Not that, as foreigners have
sometimes imagined, the constitution of the Egyptian
commonwealth prohibited by any positive law
natives, freemen, and the actual progeny of prior
rulers from participating in the government of the
country: not that any express ordination ever reserved
the succession to power and the exercise of
authority exclusively to strangers and to slaves.

<!-- vol 1 page 307 -->

Throughout every period of the domination of the
Beys, instances have existed of individuals who were
neither slaves nor strangers, but free-born Mohammedan
Turks, nay sons of Mamlukes and of Beys,
being allowed to attain the highest employments in
the state. Three generations of Beys shone in the
family of Beloofi: at this moment, Ibrahim, our
Schaich-el-belled, boasts of the great destinies that
await his son Marzook; and at some future day
you yourself, who as far as I know were never
bought nor sold, may, unless prevented by prior
claims, become one of our Beys.</p>

<p>"But a concurrence of circumstances has nearly
effected what no law ever expressly decreed. According
to our customs the prolific period of youth
is spent by the Mamluke under his patron's roof in
forced singleness, and in the society of none but his
fellow soldiers. His constitution, more liable to the
enervating tendency of the climate in proportion as
it derives from its more bracing native atmosphere a
greater natural fulness and succulence, is weakened,
perhaps his very imagination receives a fatal bias,
ere manumission allows him to quit his master's
house, and to enjoy the comforts of the connubial
state. No sooner indeed is he gifted with freedom
than he seeks a wife, were it only to acquire in the
sacredness of the harem a security for his person,
and a sanctuary for his property: but even on this
occasion his pride and his prejudice lead him to

<!-- vol 1 page 308 -->

spurn from his embrace the woman of the country,
whose seasoned constitution might counteract the
effects of his debilitated system, and suffer him
to form an alliance only with some female slave of
his own nation, on whom the climate of Egypt
exerts the same enervating influence. Seldom does
any progeny arise from these too well assorted
marriages; or, if blessed with offspring, and such as
attains maturity, it is in general too degenerate in
body and too imbecile in mind, to hold, and to
defend the parental authority against a host of
sturdier competitors: and for want of a sufficiency
of natural heirs to succeed to their possessions and
their power, the rulers of Egypt have throughout
every period of their history been obliged to seek
in fresh slaves imported from their own native
realms, the heirs to their wealth, and the successors
to their dominion.</p>

<p>"Among these creatures of servitude and devotees
to ambition, the Abases, the Tcherkassians, and
the youths of Odesh&eacute; and of Gurgistan<sup id="r169"><a href="#n169">169</a></sup> are in
general the most esteemed, as being the nearest in
blood to their patrons, and the most eminent in
corporal endowments and warlike accomplishments.
Renegadoes themselves, their masters make it a
rule, more in compliance with custom than out of
respect for religion, to raise no servant to any employment
who is not by birth or from choice a
Mohammedan. But this condition fulfilled, whatever

<!-- vol 1 page 309 -->

native of any country north of Egypt is willing
to owe his whole existence and advancement to his
patron, may aspire to all the advantages which an
Egyptian grandee can bestow. The Bey connects
with the artificial relationship between master and
slave all the reciprocal duties, nay attaches to it
all the reciprocal appellations, that belong to the
natural ties of which he lives bereft: he calls his
Mamlukes his children, and hears them call him
their father. According to the measure of their attachment,
their deserts, or their favour in his eyes,
he promotes them successively, while yet in bondage,
to all the honourable offices in his own household,
from that of simple body guard, to that of hasnadar
or treasurer; and, when manumitted, to all the
dignities in the state at his disposal, from that
of single Aga, to that of Kiashef,<sup id="r170"><a href="#n170">170</a></sup> and Bey, and
Schaich-el-belled. During his lifetime he marries
them to whatever female relations of his own he can
discover, and at his death he leaves them heirs to his
wealth and his offices. So much are these adoptive
children considered as the natural heirs to all their
patron's property, that his very wives, and sisters,
and daughters devolve to them, according to the
date of their creation and the eminence of their
rank; and the greater the number of such creatures,
devoted to his service, defending his person, devouring
his property, and raised by his patronage to
wealth and to dignities a man in power possesses,

<!-- vol 1 page 310 -->

the more the lustre reflected from these satellites
that move around him, swells his own pride, increases
his own importance, and extends his own
sway. It is by the vast circumference of its base
that we estimate the height of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Such is in Egypt the inertness of the native, and
such the insulation of the country, encompassed on
all sides by seas or by deserts, that the domination
of the Beys, though only continued by slaves, by
renegadoes, and by strangers&mdash;by men forswearing
every tie of country, of blood, of sex, and of religion,
and presenting every form of anarchy, civil
war, and murder by steel and by poison&mdash;yet subsisted
near two centuries, without being wrested
from the feeble hands that held it, either by an indigenous
subject, or by a foreign invader.</p>

<p>"At last, however, the sway of the Mamlukes
seemed destined to decline. In the year 923 of
the hegyra, Selim, Sultan of the Turks, invaded
Egypt, conquered the land of the Beys, hung their
chief, and degraded their body: the former rulers
of the country were reduced to the rank of collectors
of its revenue. Attached to different provinces,
they and their kiashefs became the farmers of
the territorial contribution; while their chief, the
Schaich-el-belled, was alone fixed at Cairo under
the watchful eye of the Sultan's own Visier.</p>

<p>"As an intermediate power between the Mamlukes
and the Pasha, the conqueror created a provincial

<!-- vol 1 page 311 -->

militia. It was destined to support the financial
operations of the Beys, and to restrain the political
influence of the Visier. It is true that these troops
swore submission to severe regulations. Confined
in the citadels of Cairo and of Djirdg&eacute;, they were
to exercise no trade, lest they should lose their
martial spirit, and to possess no land, lest they
should acquire a local interest. Great privileges,
however, made amends for these restrictions; since,
in order to render his military force independent of
his representative, the Sultan allowed its odgiaklees,
or chiefs, to enact in their own private councils the
laws necessary for the welfare of their corps.</p>

<p>"No human power, however, can be so nicely
poised, but that a little excess in some quarter will
by degrees determine all further weight to flow to
the same side; until the balance be at last wholly
destroyed. Stationary in the country, and commanding
a formidable force, the chiefs of the militia
soon began to resist indiscriminately every order of
a Pasha liable to constant removals, and the bearer
of unsupported mandates: they ended by compelling
him to sanction in the name of the sovereign the
statutes decreed in their own. A prisoner in the
castle, while suffered to remain at Cairo, he no
sooner gave the least offence, than he was dismissed
without delay.</p>

<p>"The Beys were held in still more open and
degrading subjection: for the Schaich-el-belled was

<!-- vol 1 page 312 -->

made, on days of ceremony, to hold the stirrup to
the Aga of the jenissaries. Even the subjects of
the Porte at large experienced at the hands of this
lawless soldiery the direst oppression. They could
only escape its rapacity by inlisting in its corps:
but in proportion as the candidate for this honour
was wealthier, and thus exposed to greater extortions,
he obtained less easily the immunity which
he more urgently wanted. One half of his fortune
was generally the price of his security during his
life, and at his death the other half devolved to the
regiment in which he was enrolled; nor, if a rich
individual had by some means succeeded to elude
while he lived the burthensome boon, could his
good fortune while he had breath, on his demise
avail his heirs. In default of a real engagement a
forged contract was soon produced, and promptly
acted upon.</p>

<p>"Thus did the militia of Egypt, in spite of the
Sultan's edict, soon absorb all its personal property:
nor was it long, ere, by a still more glaring infraction
of their rules, the odgiaklees became possessors
of most of the land:&mdash;but if their power at first thus
gained them inordinate wealth, that wealth again,
by a just retribution, served to undermine their
power; and just as the Nile, after rising till it overflows
the country . . . . ."</p>

<p>At this ominous simile I took fright, put my
finger on the narrator's lips, and earnestly entreated

<!-- vol 1 page 313 -->

that he would tell his tale in a straight-forward
manner, without tropes or figures&mdash;especially about
the Nile.</p>

<p>He smiled, and thus proceeded:&mdash;"By becoming
landed proprietors, the members of the militia had
rendered themselves accountable in one sense to
those very Beys who were amenable before them in
another: but there remained no longer an equal
security for the discharge of the mutual obligation.
While by the enrolment in their corps of
every peaceful citizen disposed to pay the admission
fee required, and the discarding of every able soldier
himself requiring a stipend, the militia was
become at once enfeebled at the heart and unwieldy
at its extremities, the Beys seemed to have
regained all the strength which their antagonists had
lost: for the Mamluke tribe&mdash;that indestructible
plague of Egypt, that weed always alive, and at
every new subversion of a more artificial system
again springing up in all its former luxuriance&mdash;had,
by constant fresh supplies, meanwhile recovered
all its vigour.</p>

<p>"Thus the different departments of the state, intended
by Selim to check each other's pressure,
became totally confounded; or rather, their offices
were exchanged, their interests reversed, and the
supremacy made to flow back into its pristine channels.
While the militia insensibly spread over the
surface of the land, to attend to its culture, the

<!-- vol 1 page 314 -->

Beys again flocked to Cairo, to resume their cabals:
while the odgiaklees had erst given to their creatures
the employments of the Beys, the Beys now
gave to their freed-men the rank of odgiaklees: the
public revenue, before squandered by the soldiery,
now became wasted by the Mamlukes; and what
power remained in the hands of the Sultan's forces,
was no longer employed to resist but to protect the
Sultan's enemies. The spider was left to weave its
web in silence over those gilded vaults, which had
once re-echoed with the fierce debates of commanders;
and the Pasha, who formerly had only
feared the power of the militia, now only trembled
at the name of the Beys.</p>

<p>"Scarce however had this revolution been perfected,
when the daring Aly, Bey and Schaich-el-belled,
succeeded in wresting its fruits out of the hands of
its authors. Renouncing his allegiance to the Porte,
and contracting an alliance with the Russians, he
awed into silence his colleagues, and reserved every
office for his own adoptive children. He sent his
son Isma&iuml;l to sack Damascus, and his son Hassan
to pillage Djedda; while he kept his eldest son
Mohammed at home, to bear as he could the whole
weight of his favours: and great it was;&mdash;for he
honoured him with the hand of his sister, sent for
purposely from Georgia; he heaped upon him such
riches as to cause him to be surnamed Aboo-dahab,
or the father of gold; and he endowed him with

<!-- vol 1 page 315 -->

sufficient power to create his own dependents Beys:
insomuch that at last Aboo-dahab, disabled by his
patron from rising any higher, except by stepping
on his patron's neck, slew him, in order that his
work might be completed.</p>

<p>"Nor was Aboo-dahab disappointed in this purpose.
Named Schaich-el-belled by his own Beys,
and chosen Pasha by the grateful Porte, he offered
the first example in Egypt, as he did the last, of all
the grandeur which the country can bestow, and
all the authority which the Sultan can give, united
in the same person:&mdash;but his joy was short! Intoxicated
unto madness by these too copious draughts
of successful ambition, his blood began to ferment;
his fluids turned to poison; a raging fever struck
his brain; and in the midst of Acre, which he had
taken by storm, and delivered up to pillage, one
day saw him resplendent with glory, and the next
a livid corpse.</p>

<p>"No sooner had Aboo-dahab breathed his last, than
his Mamlukes hastened back to Cairo to divide his
spoil. Ibrahim, the eldest Bey of his creation,
obtained with the place of Schaich-el-belled the
widow of Aly. Mourad, the second in rank of the
Beys named by Mohammed, married his patron's
own relict. The other Beys of Mohammed's recent
house, Osman, Mustapha, Suleiman, and the two
Ayoobs, took, according to their rank and seniority,
what else remained to be divided.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 316 -->

<p>"The younger children of Mohammed's ill requited
patron, Isma&iuml;l and Hassan, who shared not in their
eldest brother's ingratitude, had, on Aly's death,
fled to upper Egypt. There they remained quiet
during the short period of Aboo-dahab's reign;
but gained strength by an alliance with two great
Arab Schaichs; those of Esneh and of Negaddi.
Thus reinforced, they determined not to suffer
Mohammed's children to supersede the remaining
sons of Aly himself, and marched directly to Cairo.
Ibrahim, Mourad, and their party, had not yet
had leisure to prepare for the attack. With all
their followers they passed through the citadel,
situated on the utmost verge of the mount Mokhadem;
gained the defiles of that range of mountains
which extends along the right bank of the Nile into
upper Egypt, and there took that station, which
their antagonist had just quitted to occupy their
own at Cairo.</p>

<p>"Isma&iuml;l, received in the capital with acclamation,
and immediately installed as Schaich-el-belled by a
Pasha, prompt to confer the title on whosoever held
the place, lost no time in clearing his residence of
all lurking leaven of sedition. Two old Beys yet
breathed, owned by no party still in being, but
supposed secretly to favour that of Ibrahim. They
had, nevertheless, when Isma&iuml;l entered Cairo, remained
in the capital,&mdash;either prevented from quitting
it by their infirmities, or relying for protection

<!-- vol 1 page 317 -->

on their age. They were friends, and saw each
other familiarly. But when Sogeir came to pay his
court, Isma&iuml;l exacted, in proof of his loyalty, the
head of Abderahman; and Sogeir bowed submission.
In the midst of the customary reminiscences
which formed the conversation of men who had
outlived all their contemporaries, Sogeir dropped
his chaplet: Abderahman stooped to pick it up;
and Sogeir plunged his dagger into his colleague's
side. His feeble hand, however, could not give a
home thrust, and Abderahman, intended to be laid
prostrate for ever, rose from the blow, and struggled
with his adversary. The surrounding Mamlukes
viewed unmoved two men, seemingly united during
half a century in the closest bonds of friendship,
contend which should first bereave the other by
violence of the few remaining sparks of a life almost
extinct,&mdash;should first draw from the other's heart
the few remaining drops of an almost stagnant tide,
and should first thrust the other into that grave, on
whose brink both were tottering. This feat Sogeir
achieved. He then crawled back to the Schaich
with the head demanded; but, exhausted with the
fight, fell dead in the act of presenting the prize.</p>

<p>"Ibrahim and Mourad remained not much longer
in upper Egypt than Isma&iuml;l and Hassan had done
before them. With the assistance of the Arab
Schaichs of Farshoot and of Dendera, they descended
from Djirdg&eacute;, and demanded re-admittance

<!-- vol 1 page 318 -->

in Cairo. Isma&iuml;l consented, in hopes of more
effectually ending the struggle by treachery. With
the concurrence of Ezedlee the Pasha, his antagonists
were to be murdered in the citadel, in full
Divan. Hassan, however, dissatisfied with the small
share of power ceded him by Isma&iuml;l, thought he
now had the means for ever to secure the gratitude
of the adverse party. He warned its leaders of
the plot; and the same night Ibrahim and Mourad
with all their adherents again evacuated Cairo. As
soon as they had passed the gates, they proclaimed
all reconciliation with Isma&iuml;l henceforth at an end,
and went back to their old post at Djirdg&eacute;. Here
they fortified themselves, and determined to reduce
the capital by famine. All provisions which descended
the Nile were intercepted, and Isma&iuml;l at
last found himself obliged by the impending scarcity
to collect his few troops, to march southward, and
to give his rivals battle. It was Hassan who gave
them the victory, by going over to their side in the
midst of the combat. Isma&iuml;l immediately fled back
to Cairo.</p>

<p>"The Schaich-el-belled's popularity in the capital
had been annihilated by his exactions. Closely
pursued, he felt his situation desperate. In haste
he loaded his camels with his treasure, abandoned
his honours, and crossed the desert as a fugitive.
At Gaze he embarked for Stambool, to seek assistance
from the Porte.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 319 -->

<p>"As Isma&iuml;l went out at one gate of the city,
Ibrahim and Mourad rushed in at the other. Content
to resume their former station, they impeded
not their enemy's convenient flight. After reinstating
themselves in all their offices, they strengthened
their party and rewarded their adherents, by
making a considerable promotion of Beys and of
Kiashefs.</p>

<p>"Hassan himself gained the least by his defection.
This Bey, surnamed Djeddawee from the sacking
of that city, was among those unfortunate individuals
who with the greatest physical bravery,
entirely want moral resolution and steadiness; by
their waverings and changes forfeit the confidence
of all parties, and to every faction alike appear
more desirable in the character of avowed enemies,
than in that of seeming friends. Whatever sacrifices
he might make to the cause he espoused, they were
uniformly attributed to interested motives; truth
from his lips was received as falsehood; and generosity
in his behaviour could only be viewed as
cunning. The bare circumstance of his asserting
a fact caused it to be discredited, and his being the
author of a scheme sufficed for its rejection. Thus
situated, he always found the thanks of his associates
short of his pretensions, failed not soon to accuse
his colleagues of black ingratitude, and scarce had
joined a party, when he afresh meditated a change.
His most ordinary converse necessarily degenerated

<!-- vol 1 page 320 -->

into a tissue of dissimulation and fraud which produced
no illusion; and his life became a series of
intrigues and of cabals which brought him no benefit.
Tired of his complaints and fearing his fickleness,
the sons of Mohammed resolved to stop his reproaches
by cutting short his career. The Saturday
exercises in the place of Rouma&iuml;li were fixed upon
to execute the purpose.</p>

<p>"The exercise of the djereed was over. One of
Mourad's Mamlukes enters the lists for the game of
the jar.<sup id="r171"><a href="#n171">171</a></sup> He advances in the circle, takes aim,
fires, and misses. A second darts forward, and
equally fails. A third now tries in his turn: his
ball goes wider still than the former from the pretended
mark; but it strikes the real one,&mdash;for it
grazes the turban of Djeddawee. Every bystander
loudly laments the accident. The Bey alone saw
the intent: he saw his death-warrant signed. Immediately
he calls round him his Mamlukes, and
from their close pressed circle raises the cry of war
and the sword of defiance. His suite all draw their
sabres: so do Mohammed's children. The games
cease; the fight commences: the few remaining adherents
of Isma&iuml;l join the banners of Hassan.</p>

<p>"Three entire days did every street of Cairo in
turns become the field of battle. Three entire
days did every stone of the capital in turns stream
with blood. At last Hassan felt his strength give
way, and saw his supporters fall off one by one.

<!-- vol 1 page 321 -->

On the point of being overwhelmed by his enemy's
superior force, he gathers together a small troop
which he still could rely upon, and breaks through
the very midst of his assailants. With a speed
which nothing could slacken, he gains the vast
suburb of Boolak, on the Nile, and there seeks
shelter in the house of an old friend, of the Schaich
Damanhoori. The sanctity even of that distant
asylum is disregarded, and the approach invested,
a few minutes after its gates had received the noble
fugitive.</p>

<p>"For a while however, intrenching himself behind
the inclosure of his fortress, Hassan gallantly stands
the siege, from every window and battlement of the
edifice pours down upon Mourad's satellites every
species of murderous implement, and makes many
a foe atone with his life for the relentless pursuit.
But after more than an hour's strenuous defence,
he beholds from the top of the building the door
burst open, and the entire hostile torrent rush in at
once. He now resolves to quit the hopeless contest,
and to save himself by flight. Mounting on the
terrace of the mansion no longer secure, he thence
clambers on the roof of a neighbouring house.
From that, passes on to the next, and in this manner
vaults from terrace to terrace,<sup id="r172"><a href="#n172">172</a></sup> and climbs from
roof to roof&mdash;sometimes scaling almost inaccessible
heights, at others leaping down awful precipices,
and at others again clearing frightful chasms&mdash;till

<!-- vol 1 page 322 -->

at last he gains the furthermost of the habitations
that form a connected cluster. Here he finds his
a&euml;rial progress stopped; and from the summit of
this final promontory again is compelled to descend
to the regions below, and to return to the level of his
pursuers. From the terrace he lets himself down
into the attics; from these into a lower floor: gains
the top of the stairs, runs down an hundred steps,
reaches the hall, and opens the entrance door. In
the very porch stood sentinel a hostile Mamluke of
gigantic stature, waiting his arrival to intercept his
passage: him he fells with his sabre at a single
blow, and mounting the Mamluke's own steed, he
rides back at full speed to Cairo. But at every
turn his antagonists were watching. They soon
espy his escape: and in a moment he heard the
whole troop again close at his heels. Danger seemed
to lend him wings. He reaches Cairo the first,&mdash;though
scarce by the distance of a pistol shot.
Clearing the crowded entrance of the city, and
pushing up the main street, he rushes, as soon as
opportunity favours, into the midst of the most
populous and busy district; runs up one narrow
lane, and down another. As he enters a new division,
he causes its gates to be shut behind him,
in order to delay the progress of his pursuers.
Meeting a string of camels carrying water, he rends
open the skins with his dagger, to increase the
slippery smoothness of the pavement. Coming up

<!-- vol 1 page 323 -->

with a file of arabas, conveying a wedding, he tilts
over the waggons to bar the passage. No throng
of human beings, however great, stops his career.
His yatagan cuts its way through the thickest
cluster of passengers. Overthrowing some, trampling
others under foot, he still advances unslackened in
his speed. Every where warning shouts announce
his approach; every where screams of terror precede
his rapid steps. At sight of him the horror-struck
mob flies in every direction like chaff before
the hurricane; and his wide circuit frequently
bringing him back to the same places in which he
had appeared before&mdash;but each time more pale,
and ghastly, and covered with blood than before&mdash;he
at last begins to be viewed as his own ghost,
still continuing the flight of the body. It was a
stupendous thing to behold a vast capital, successively
filled throughout each of its numerous quarters,
from one end to the other, with ever increasing
terror and dismay, by the appearance of a single
man,&mdash;and that man himself a fugitive, only darting
by like a meteor; just heard, just seen, and then
again disappearing.</p>

<p>"Hassan's strength now begins to fail him. His
horse is ready to drop. His pursuers,&mdash;who for a
while had lost his track,&mdash;guided by the clamour
of the mob at his appearance, again recover the
scent They gain ground upon him so fast, that

<!-- vol 1 page 324 -->

nothing seems capable any longer of saving him
from becoming their victim.</p>

<p>"He now bethinks himself of one last desperate
expedient. The house of his most inveterate enemy,&mdash;of
Ibrahim, the Schaich-el-belled&mdash;had just risen
in sight. He springs from his exhausted steed, no
longer able to move, and, summoning all his remaining
strength, runs to this perilous abode, and gains
with difficulty its frowning portal. Entering the reluctant
gates, he forces his way athwart the bevy of
astonished pages, who in vain try to stop the intruder;
and makes straight for the holy of holies,
for the women's apartment. Pushing away right and
left the eunuchs, the slaves, and the guards, stationed
to defend the entrance of the gynec&aelig;um, he bursts
open the prohibited door, advances through the labyrinth
of narrow passages, and at last, after many
wanderings, reaches the very centre of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>"Here, totally exhausted, and faint with fatigue
and loss of blood from many a wound inflicted by
a distant carbine, Djiddawee at last stops, lays
down on the rich carpet his ensanguined sword, and
viewing before him that mightiest of her sex, the
sister of Aly, the widow of Mohammed, and the
wife of Ibrahim&mdash;risen from her seat in mute astonishment,&mdash;he
throws himself prostrate at her feet,
clasps the hem of her embroidered garment, and
implores her all-powerful protection.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 325 -->

<p>"What could Ash-har do? when a son of her brother,
and a brother of her first husband, humbled
to the dust, implored her to save his life!</p>

<p>"She swore to protect him, while he remained in
her sight; and in her presence none durst lift his
hand against the supplicant. Even Ibrahim her
husband consented to respect his hated existence,
until he again should go forth from the shadow of
his roof.</p>

<p>"But Mourad appears! Furious from his numerous
disappointments and Hassan's hair-breadth
escapes, he demands possession of his victim, or
threatens to abandon his party. The Schaich-el-belled
wavers, and at last consents to cast a stain
upon his character, in order to satisfy his colleague.
In defiance of the laws of hospitality he insists on
Hassan's quitting his habitation, content to receive
a safeguard to the frontiers of Egypt. The Bey
was not in a condition to decline the specious offer.
Accompanied by a numerous escort, he takes leave
and departs. But what is his new dismay, when
he learns on the road that his destination is the
very town in Arabia, once the scene of his devastations!
To turn him adrift among the injured
populace of Djedda was to devote him to a death
more cruel than the fate from which he had fled.
On the least resistance, however, to the mandate of
his enemies, he was to be killed on the spot. He

<!-- vol 1 page 326 -->

therefore feigned acquiescence, and suffered himself
quietly to be conveyed to Suez, and there to be
embarked for the harbour of Meccah. At sea he
might by surprise have slain a few of his conductors,
but in so rash an attempt he must soon
have been overpowered by the rest. He devised a
better plan. In the darkness of the night he fell
upon the re&iuml;s himself, the moment sleep closed his
eyelids; and with his arm round the pilot's throat
and his pistol to his heart, he forced him to steer
for the African coast, and for the port of Cosseir.
There, under favour of a mob whom the cry of a
son of Aly soon collected round the boat, ready for
his defence, he disembarked, by forced marches
gained Akmim, and from that place plunged
into the desert. In a few days he reached the
tents of his former Arab allies. Under their wing
he took shelter: the fame of his wonderful escape
spread in all directions:&mdash;at last it reached Cairo,
and the wreck of his party, remaining in that
capital, insensibly withdrew, and joined, high up
the Nile, its imperishable leader.</p>

<p>"Isma&iuml;l, on his arrival at Constantinople, had
found the Porte too deeply engaged in war with
Austria, to involve itself in fresh hostilities with
Egypt. Tired of consuming his time in fruitless
expectation, and his wealth in unproductive bribes,
he at last reimbarked, landed at Dern&eacute;, and through

<!-- vol 1 page 327 -->

the oasis of Sewa, rejoined Hassan near the Cataracts.
Either chief had gained too little by deserting
the other, not to meet his former rival with willing
heart halfway. Common disappointment for this
time riveted the union of the Beys. They agreed
to consign to oblivion the past, and for the future
never more to abandon each other.</p>

<p>"Thus far,"&mdash;added my Osmanlee,&mdash;"the engagement
has remained inviolate. Three years and
more the sturdy veterans have continued to live
together in undisturbed possession of Es-souan,
the furthest place in the Sa&iuml;d, on this side the falls.
Too weak to molest the chiefs at Cairo, and too
near the confines of Nubia to fear their molestation,
they are watched, but are left quiet. All the land
on either side the river, their small district excepted,
obeys Ibrahim and Mourad. These chiefs
reign uncontrolled at Cairo, and heavy is the yoke
which they impose upon the provinces. But it
bears alike on every one, and therefore appears less
galling than the partial miseries of a civil war.
People pray for an oppression which prevents their
being torn limb from limb, in the strife of contending
parties."</p>

<p>Here ended the long narration of my Ca&iuml;reen
friend,&mdash;and high time it was. Already rose in sight
the vast pyramids to the right, and the castle of Cairo
on our left. Each passenger began to collect his

<!-- vol 1 page 328 -->

parcels: and scarce half an hour more elapsed, ere
we cast anchor at Boolak, and stepped ashore. Our
little party broke up, and every one of its members
went his different way. My new friend and myself
walked on together to Cairo.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>FROM the brilliant descriptions given me of the
celebrated Masr<sup id="r173"><a href="#n173">173</a></sup>&mdash;of the kalish<sup id="r174"><a href="#n174">174</a></sup> that runs through
its centre, and of the birkets<sup id="r175"><a href="#n175">175</a></sup> that adorn its outskirts&mdash;I expected, if not an earthly, at least an
aquatic paradise. On first reaching this vaunted
city, I saw nothing but filth and ruins on the outside,
and filth and misery within. "So much!"
exclaimed I&mdash;thinking of Aly Tshawoosh&mdash;"for
travellers' tales!"</p>

<p>"So, too, said I," echoed my companion the
Ca&iuml;reen&mdash;somewhat nettled&mdash;"on first entering
Stambool." The retort startled me in my turn.
"Heavens and earth!" was my answer, "would
you compare Cairo with Constantinople? Where
can you find the least resemblance? Is it between

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

the vile offensive swamps which here have confounded
the river with its banks, and the verdant
hills which there hem in the very sea? between the
yellow muddy stream here treasured up for refreshment
in sooty pitchers, and the crystal rills there
gushing forth from golden fountains? or finally
between the smoke-dried men, tattooed women, and
blear-eyed bloated children of this over-grown beggarly
place, and our population of patriarchs, of
houries, and of cherubs? In Constantinople the
very cemeteries of the dead look like portions of
elysium; here the habitations of the living already
seem charnel-houses."</p>

<p>"With us each gem has its foil," observed my
friend drily; "and we admire our beauties the more
from the relief, produced by that very circumstance.
Suspend your judgment on our comforts till you
see the palaces of our Beys."</p>

<p>This was not to be my destiny immediately. I
had observed the haughty looks and gorgeous apparel
of the meanest of the Mamlukes who condescended
to mix among the populace; and I wished
to avoid the privileged cast, until I might vie in my
appearance at least with its inferior members. I therefore
was content to sleep the first night at a khan;
and the next morning prepared for presenting my
letters. Keeping my friend Aly in my mind as
my model, I put on my gayest attire, and, when
fully equipped for my visit, viewed myself in a

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

looking-glass with such complacency, that I began
at last to apprehend the fate of Narcissus, and,
for fear of catching the evil eye from myself, tried
to spit in my own face;<sup id="r176"><a href="#n176">176</a></sup>&mdash;deeming an extraordinary
case to require an extraordinary remedy.</p>

<p>This exploit performed&mdash;not without some labour,&mdash;I
sallied forth, feeling quite secure as to what
might happen. A fellow in the street, himself
totally deprived of eyesight, showed me the way
with the utmost readiness to Suleiman's palace.
The grandeur of its portal, far from damping
my confidence, rather elevated my pride, by promising
a theatre worthy of my ambition. Bounding
like a ball, I ascended its spacious stairs, paced the
long gallery, and entered the hall of audience. Perceiving
the Bey, seated in the angle of his sofa at
the upper end of the room, I boldly advanced,&mdash;retorting
with equally haughty glances the supercilious
and scrutinizing looks of the gay youths who
lined the passage,&mdash;and, when arrived near their
patron, put my hand to the ground, to my forehead
and my lips, and presented my credentials with
every possible grace.</p>

<p>Throughout the East, grandees, when first addressed,
preserve an impenetrable countenance.
Their internal emotions lie concealed under a mask
of stone. Thus they avoid committing themselves,
as they must in some measure be liable to do,
were they even to express the reverse of what they

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

feel. Still I fancied I could discern athwart the
Bey's immoveable features such an impression, produced
by my first address, as left me little cause for
uneasiness. Once or twice, while one of his eyes
affected most diligently to run over the recommendatory
lines, I caught the other straying from
the paper, and stealing a sly survey of my person,
with an air of most encouraging approbation.
Having at last&mdash;apparently with great toil&mdash;completed
the perusal of the long epistle, Suleiman
laid it by him on the sofa, wiped his face, and
bade me welcome. "My friend Othman," said the
Bey&mdash;moving his little hands in unison with his
speech&mdash;"describes you as possessed of valuable
talents, and I feel anxious to acquire a claim to
your services. Unfortunately," added he in a
lower tone, after beckoning to his attendants to
retire out of hearing, "our Mamlukes, with all
their excellent qualities, are somewhat addicted to
idleness, to deceit, and to treachery, and extremely
jealous of all whom they look upon as intruders:
nor dare we openly brave these little weaknesses,
or confer on a stranger what these our adopted
children consider as their rightful honours. Indeed,
the stranger himself would soon have cause to rue
the unavailing favour. I therefore do not immediately
give you in my house a definite office. But
stay as a guest, a friend, a household counsellor;
and in time the thing I wish may be managed.

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

God be praised, you are not at least a native Turk!
Like us, you are an Islamite from choice."</p>

<p>After this little preamble the Bey proceeded to
try me on the nature and extent of my acquirements;
and, as he was not sorry that his Mamlukes
should have an opportunity&mdash;which occurred
but seldom&mdash;of witnessing his own vast erudition,
he made signs to them to return within hearing-distance,
during the examination. An Italian missionary
had once given him a dictionary, as a book
replete with short and pithy stories; and in its
sedulous perusal the Bey had contrived to pick up
a considerable assortment of technical terms of art
and science, which he employed as it pleased Providence.
Of the things themselves whose appellations
he had learnt, he seemed to have no more idea
than the huge Angora cat which sat purring by his
side; and an elementary chaos of astronomy, tactics,
geography, mythology and medicine, all huddled
together at random in his brain, flowed in most
picturesque confusion from his lips. Extensive
therefore as certainly was the general outline of his
attainments, it still left me room to fill up a few
intervening blanks in such a way as to give a very
favourable opinion of my own information, even
without presuming so far on its superiority as to tell
his highness point blank, for instance, that England
lay not contiguous to India,&mdash;as he had imagined
from their constant warfare; or that Voltaire

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

had never been Pope of Rome,&mdash;as he had
inferred from the frequent juxtaposition of these
personages in his missionary's anecdotes. With
all this forbearance, however, my course of practical
education at the arsenal, joined to the speculative
topics which I had heard discussed at Pera, still
enabled me to pass myself off in the meridian of
Cairo for a youth of no common accomplishments;
and at every answer I gave to Suleiman's subtle
queries, he failed not to assume a profound look,
and, after some little apparent meditation, to exclaim
in an emphatic tone "good, very good, excellent,
admirable! In time you will know as much
as I do!" The only thing which seemed to give a
little offence was my affirming peremptorily that the
earth revolved round the sun, and not the sun round
the earth. At this bold assertion, so contrary to
my previous caution, the Bey looked as if he suspected
me of a design to play upon his credulity;
and I could only get out of the difficulty into which
my pride of learning had led me, by assuring him
that it was among us a very common belief; which
he nevertheless still wondered that so sensible a
fellow as I seemed to be, should have adopted.</p>

<p>When satisfied with the exalted idea which he
doubted not he had given me of his own learning,
Suleiman by degrees descended to more familiar
topics; and I now was surprised in my turn to find
a man, so utterly ignorant in matters of general information,

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

at the same time so much at home in
all that concerned the immediate interests of his
country and station. But, like many other people,
the Bey prized his knowledge in proportion to its
rarity, and seemed to value most that of which he
possessed the least. He threw out all his questions
about the politics of the Porte in so careless a manner,
and seemed so little to heed my answers, that
an indifferent by-stander would have sworn, the most
vital subjects to Suleiman were just those which
weighed the least in his mind.</p>

<p>Having exhausted every topic of more immediate
importance to himself,&mdash;"You have been long at
Stambool," said he at last, "and therefore cannot
fail to know all about Franguestan.<sup id="r177"><a href="#n177">177</a></sup> What bone,
pray, are those Christian dogs now contending for?
Do they think they possess enough upon the earth:
or are they planning some expedition to the moon?
Blind as they be, poor creatures! they bustle about
as eagerly as those that can see!" I assured him that
this blindness and this bustle had increased to such a
degree, that, from one end of Europe to the other,
every potentate was actually at the present moment
disposing of his neighbour's property, as if it had
been his own!<sup id="r178"><a href="#n178">178</a></sup></p>

<p>Book-learning and general politics might afford
a pretty pastime; but, with a race like the Mamlukes,
whose chiefs as well as meanest individuals
were always required to be on the alert, and ready

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

alike for attack, for defence, and for retreat, skill in
the exercise of the carbine, the pistol, and the sabre
were more essential,&mdash;indeed, were indispensable
qualifications in every candidate for preferment.
In respect of these military accomplishments also
Othman-Bey had in his letter mentioned me with
praise; but I perceived in Suleiman a conviction
that the same human being could not possess talents
so opposite and so varied. When therefore I begged
permission to join in the martial sports of his Mamlukes,
appointed for the next day, he strongly tried
to dissuade me, lest I should only expose my want
of skill; but my perseverance conquered. He at
last consented, though evidently concerned at my
obstinacy, and pitying my rashness. Not so his
young Mamlukes! They were delighted with anticipations
of the sorry figure which the stranger was
expected to make; and significant glances circulated
round every part of the room. The morrow was to
be a day of merriment.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour on that morrow I went to
the Bey's palace, and found the whole household
assembled in the court-yard, ready to sally forth.
We soon marched out in grand procession; but
when I inquired whither we were going, not a creature
knew. The Beys are too fearful to trust their
followers with so important a secret. Not until the

receive intelligence of the destined halting-place.
Off he then sets, on his dromedary, to make his
preparations: the rest follow with loud clamour;
and when the place of destination is reached, the
Mamlukes immediately dispose themselves in a spacious
ring round the ground.</p>

<p>The Koobbet-el-haue proved to be the spot selected;
and I suspected the Bey of a secret wish to
verify his forebodings, when I understood it to be
the most trying ground about Cairo for martial
exercises. In order to judge how it lay, and to
study the mode of play of the Mamlukes, I hung
back at first, as if not daring to enter the lists with
men so distinguished for their skill and address:
but of course, the less alacrity I showed, the more
I was pressed to expose myself. "The youngsters
knew, it was in sheer compassion upon their inferiority,
that I did not choose to come forward.
But my backwardness would not serve me: I stood
engaged, and my modesty must be put to the blush."</p>

<p>As if only reluctantly urged on by these ironical
observations, I at last, in seeming trepidation,
snatched up a djereed. In order to render my incapacity
the more palpable, the most indifferent
performer of the set was pitted against me. Off
went my adversary's staff! and after it every eye.
Spite of my indifferent steed, I avoided the blow,
and the harmless stick only raised a cloud of dust.
All wondered at my escape. In my turn I flung

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

the wooden weapon, but not with similar effect. It
reached its destination, and most unequivocally delivered
its errand. The astonishment of the spectators
redoubled, and my antagonist, dismounted,
limped in rage out of the circle. The rest of his
companions now began to suspect that it was not a
tyro's task to contend with the new comer. The
more skilful players took their turn. They had
little better success; and the first exclamations of
surprise gradually subsided in speechless disappointment
and dismay. Every voice was hushed, and
every lip bleeding with bites of vexation.</p>

<p>I had the good fortune to show equal dexterity
in the use of the pistol and the sabre. The jar
flew in pieces, and the felt<sup id="r179"><a href="#n179">179</a></sup> was cut through and
through. In the Koobbet-el-haue at Cairo I thus
first reaped the fruits of the exercises performed in
the Oc-meidan of Constantinople, and the dejection
of spirits which led me to the one, prepared the
way for the triumph which I obtained in the other.
So high rose in an instant my reputation, that the
Bey himself proposed to try his hand against me.
I had heard him described as an indifferent performer.
I could have no doubt that, equal as my
skill appeared to that of Suleiman's ablest Mamlukes,
I had little to fear from their master. Yet
did every person present seem to revive at the bare
proposal of the match. "How is this?" thought
I:&mdash;but a moment's reflection gave me the clue to

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

the phenomenon. "Ah rogues!" I inwardly exclaimed&mdash;on
penetrating the new drift of my friends&mdash;"to
see me victorious is now precisely what you
wish for, in order that I may irretrievably lose the
favour of the Bey. But take leave of your hopes!
Selim not only knows when to play well, but also
when to play ill; "and in fact, I took such uncommon
pains for this prudent purpose, that, on quitting
the field, Suleiman pronounced me by far the
best player next to himself he knew in Cairo, and
the one he liked most to engage with; and, on returning
home, took me definitively into his service.
Fearful, however, of putting me at once on the footing
of the favoured cast, he placed me for the present
among his seratches.<sup id="r180"><a href="#n180">180</a></sup> My salary was trifling; but
who, among the followers of Beys of Egypt, depended
upon his wages for his emolument?</p>

<p>Suleiman possessed, in addition to the numerous
Mamluke sprigs, ingrafted upon the family tree, one
male, and sundry female suckers, directly sprung
from the original stock. To his female offspring
Suleiman seemed attached: the male shoot no one
could accuse him of spoiling, at least by excess of
fondness. He considered the Bey-zad&eacute; as a perfect
cypher. Seldom he deigned to inquire after his
health: never to demand his presence. "What
interest," would he say, "can I take in a plant on
which all culture is thrown away? Why cherish a
reed, too feeble to support my increasing age? What

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

I lay out on a conceited idiot, who forgets his deficiencies
only to remember his birth, I lay out to
utter loss: I even expend it without reaping empty
thanks! Are not then my gifts more wisely bestowed
on men whom I cherish for their intrinsic merit, and
who reward me with their gratitude?" To this mode
of reasoning, I, for one, could not possibly object.</p>

<p>Various were the sorts of merit which, in the eyes
of my patron, took precedence of kindred. Valour,
capacity, zeal, each obtained their share of superior
esteem: but the quality rated above all others was
a pair of ruddy cheeks. Among many other instances
of their paramount influence, a young fellow
from Odesch&eacute;, remarkable for his stupidity and
peevishness, had just superseded in the Bey's favour,
and in the place of Tchibookdjee,<sup id="r181"><a href="#n181">181</a></sup> a Georgian,
esteemed for his good qualities by all his
companions; and that, for no other earthly reason
which any one could discover, except that his face
looked like a ripe Damascus peach. Suleiman himself
saw nothing singular in this fancy. "People,"
he said, "value a tulip, a shawl, a ruby, a canary-bird,
a horse, for the brightness of their hue: they
dress up their domestics in the gaudiest colours!
Why then should they not be as particular about
their faces? and choose their attendants by the same
rule as their flower-pots,&mdash;since both alike are destined
to furnish their chamber? For my part, it is
my delight, when I cast my eyes around, to view a

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

long row of handsome busts; and I think I may be
permitted to be as fastidious about the hue of my
pages, as my neighbour Ayoob is about that of his
pipe-sticks!"</p>

<p>Fortunately, the new comer possessed not in his
complexion wherewithal to make any very valuable
addition to Suleiman's collection of youthful colours,
as it must have kept me at home much oftener than
I liked, for fear of disturbing the set. So far from
my hues being any longer of a pure and primitive
description, they were rather become what painters
might call neutral tints, and such as could not, by
their absence, leave the smallest sensible gap in the
Bey's prismatic scale. Scarce a day therefore passed
without my allowing myself&mdash;in company with some
of the younger Mamlukes of our house&mdash;time to
visit Maallim<sup id="r182"><a href="#n182">182</a></sup> Ibrahim, Maallim Yacoob, Maallim
Yoossef, or some other of the Maallims, or writers
of the Coobtic persuasion, who lived round the lake
Yusbekieh.<sup id="r183"><a href="#n183">183</a></sup> They assisted us in keeping up some
of our good old Christian customs; for they never
would let us depart without reviving our spirits
with a few glasses of rakie: "in order," they said,
"to keep out of our stomachs all the water that
surrounded us." This good purpose, however, they
sometimes overshot; for one evening my companion
and myself took so copious a dose of the antidote,
that on returning home, we no longer could distinguish
the path from the canal that ran alongside

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

of it; and so fell into the ditch, which was full to
the brink. My companion first pulled me in, and
I afterwards pulled him out; and he felt so thankful
for this trifling compliment, that from that moment
we became sworn friends. Some of the other
Mamlukes, indeed, wished to sow the seeds of discord
between us; but in vain they tried to damp
the ardour of an attachment begun in a ditch.</p>

<p>Rashooan was my comrade's name: Gurgistan
his country. He possessed in an eminent degree all
the qualities in which Mamlukes excel. Equally
active and vigorous, he could break the most unruly
horse; leaped a ditch (when sober) with the agility
of a deer; brought his steed to a dead stand in the
midst of the swiftest race; and wielded with equal
dexterity the scimitar, the musket, and the pistol.</p>

<p>One day I found him describing in glowing terms
to a knot of his companions the glories of his native
soil. Its flowers, fruits, verdure, streamlets, men,
women&mdash;its very tobacco-stoppers&mdash;were, according
to his account, positively of a different nature from
those of every other country; and could he but
once more behold this land of wonders, he would
resign his breath contented! "I did not know,
Rashooan," said I, when the party separated, "that
you so grievously regretted your native country."
"Nor I neither," was his answer;&mdash;"and between
ourselves, I pray to God every morning that I may
never see it again. A sad exchange for fine horses,

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

rich caparisons, costly armour, sumptuous apparel,
Egyptian grooms, and Negro slaves indeed would
be that of a life of mere hardships and poverty;&mdash;and
for what purpose? Only to find myself forgotten
by my parents, and recognized by nobody but
a landlord who would sell me again, as he sold me
before! I have lost my relish for simplicity, and am
weaned from mother nature. But my imagination
got the better, just now, of my sober senses, and
besides, it is not amiss, now and then, to remind
these pert coxcombs that they are only savages, and
that I am a Georgian."</p>

<p>Scarce had Rashooan uttered these words, when
two or three of Suleiman's younger Mamlukes came
running to us, and addressing my friend, said in an
animated tone: "Either something very good, or
very bad, is hanging over your head. We have
left Othman kiashef closeted with the Bey, and you
seem to be the sole theme of their discourse. Both
repeated your name frequently, and with considerable
vehemence." "Ah!" answered Rashooan,
"if any thing extraordinary awaits me, it is sure
to be bad. I never was fortunate myself; nor ever
brought good fortune to others! When a boy I
was sent among the Kabardahs. Kind people!
My host adopted me as his child; his wife sealed
the act with the milk from her own breast; and his
sons swore to treat me as a brother. What was the
consequence? Tartars carried me off, my adopted

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

kinsmen fell in my defence, and I was sold to the
Turks. I now am a slave by habit as well as from
necessity, and no longer wish to be free: the chance
therefore is that I am doomed to have my liberty."</p>

<p>Other Mamlukes now brought Rashooan word
that his presence was commanded. Sighing he
went, and in about half an hour returned to us with
a countenance clouded by sadness; "Selim," said
he, "I leave you: for ever I leave the house of the
noble Suleiman."</p>

<p>"What motive," cried I, "can induce the Bey
to part with a favourite?"</p>

<p>"Listen," answered Rashooan: "Othman kiashef
had an elder brother in Georgia, settled at a distant
place. The kiashef has just discovered that I am
that brother's son. He has consequently requested
of Suleiman to purchase me. But, as you may suppose,
our patron did not think himself warranted by
any circumstance, however singular, to listen to the
proposal. 'Such a disgrace,' cried he, 'as that of
bartering my Mamluke for money, shall lie neither
on his head nor on mine. Suleiman may inflict death
on an undutiful son, but his enemies shall never say
'he exchanged him for gold!'</p>

<p>"Othman upon this looked exceedingly dejected,
and Suleiman for awhile seemed rather to enjoy his
distress. At last he proceeded thus: 'Since, however,
Rashooan is your nephew, God forbid I
should keep him from his uncle's longing arms.

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

Receive the young man as my gift, and let the
donor ever remain near your heart.'</p>

<p>"Othman," pursued the Georgian, "would fain
have excused himself from accepting me in the
burthensome form of a present; but, unable to
obtain his nephew on any other terms, he submits.
I therefore leave you; I leave all that is dear
to me! Torn in my childhood from my natural
friends, I now in my youth am wrested from all
my adoptive brethren. But the will of God be
done!"</p>

<p>We accompanied Rashooan back to the palace,
where he took an affectionate leave of his patron
and his friends. All regretted the young Mamluke
sincerely; and Suleiman himself appeared greatly
moved. Little did he foresee what luck his gift one
day would bring him!</p>

<p>The removal of Rashooan left me fewer inducements
for rambling, and this was fortunate; for
every day the Bey could less endure my absence.
I was his cyclop&aelig;dia, and whatever puzzled his
sagacious brain&mdash;whether a paragraph on Egypt
in an old Vienna gazette, or the site of Cairo in a
worn-out Nurnberg map; whether the arranging of
a microscope presented by a traveller, or the telling
of the weather by a barometer extorted from a jew;
whether the construction of a barge, or the design
of a keoschk&mdash;all was referred to me, as to the
oracle in chief: so that many a time, when there

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

occurred what seemed inexplicable riddles to Mamluke
intellects, I could only escape my part of
&OElig;dipus, by my insufficient proficiency in the language
of the Egyptian sphynx; and my ignorance
of the Arabic saved my credit for information on
many other subjects. The Bey, however, recommended
me to the tuition of a schaich, bred in the
college of El Azhar,<sup id="r184"><a href="#n184">184</a></sup> not doubting that, when
once taught all the refinements of the Ca&iuml;reen idiom,
I should no longer be at a loss for an answer on any
topic whatsoever. He thought me a positive abyss
of science; and in truth it would have been difficult
to discover on what foundation bottomed my knowledge.
Whenever I feared that its want of solid
basis might become palpable, I diverted the Bey's
attention by some piece of flattery. Not that I
ever condescended to perform so inferior an office in
the endless departments of adulation, as that of administering
to Suleiman his daily dose of crude unmodified
incense, which, in common with all other
grandees, he had from long and inveterate habit
come to regard&mdash;like his daily pill of opium&mdash;as an
absolute necessary to his constitution; and therefore
took as a thing he could not well dispense
with, but no longer either derived much exhilaration
from, or felt much gratitude for. The task of
cramming him with this insipid sort of panegyric I
left to the vulgar herd of attendants. Mine was
the nicer office of stimulating the appetite, and of

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

heightening the flavour of the draught, through
means of that little previous fermentation which gives
spirit to the flattest beverage. I therefore usually began
by putting my patron, by some point blank contradiction,
into a violent rage. To yield afterwards
to the force and perspicuity of his arguments, was a
species of adulation perfectly irresistible: it gave
my patron all the pleasure of a complete surprise,
and me, all the appearance of a sturdy sincerity!</p>

<p>Such pains to please deserved a recompense, and
the reward was liberally bestowed; but in a mode
nearly as circuitous as that in which it had been
earned. Suleiman naturally abhorred a direct gift:
what he usually granted to his favourites, was an
opportunity of grinding other favourites, already
provided for,&mdash;or of laying under contribution some
dependent or client. He would send me, for instance,
to inform some rich jew proteg&eacute; that he had
been thinking of him all day, or some wealthy
christian tradesman that he had been dreaming of
him all night; and truly I had never before experienced
such a solid way of thinking, or such golden
dreams! As an additional favour, he introduced
me to all his most distinguished colleagues; particularly
to Ibrahim-Bey Sogeir, to Mustapha-Bey
Skanderani, and to Ayoob-Bey the great. This
latter was pleased to express great regret that the
commander of the kirlangitsch should not have addressed
me, at my outset, to himself.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

<p>On first entering Suleiman's house, I had found
the envy of his Mamlukes entirely centred in the
Tchibookdjee. It was hard to digest so marked a
preference shown a native of Odesch&eacute;, whatever
might be the colour of his cheeks. But when I,
who was not even a purchased slave, became the
Bey's right hand, only for practising a few foreign
juggling tricks&mdash;as they were politely termed,&mdash;even
the favourite was thought aggrieved, and began to
be pitied. Accustomed to dissimulation, he however
preserved with me an exterior of civility, tempered
only by a few cutting remarks, so expressed
as to seem to arise from sheer kindness; until a
favourable opportunity at last offered of letting
loose upon me all his long-suppressed malice.</p>

<p>Suleiman had been rather too eager one day in
exhibiting his prowess at the djereed. Over-heated
with an exercise too violent for his age, he returned
home greatly indisposed. His illness soon became
so violent a fever that his life was thought in
danger; and his hakem in ordinary, at his slender
wit's soon reached ends, no longer knew what to do.
All his Mamlukes stood aghast round their patron,
expecting every hour to be his last. I was looking
on with the rest, when all at once it occurred to me
that I need not remain an idle spectator. Eugenius,
my French instructor at Pera, whose strong mind
lodged in but a weakly sort of a body, had on occasions
derived relief from an English powder, which

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

he always kept himself provided with. Of this
panacea he had at parting given me a few papers,
as a valuable present. But Anastasius in health
never remembered that Anastasius might fall ill, and
the medicine was abandoned to whoever chose to try
its efficacy: an occurrence the more frequent, as the
result of the experiment always was favourable. It
however now struck me that, possibly, among my
clothes, there might be some powders left which
might save the Bey's life, and make my own
fortune.</p>

<p>Full of this idea, I broke through the circle,
burst out of the room, and ran, with a throbbing
heart, to my own chamber to look for the medicine.
But where to find it I knew not. Every corner of
my box was ransacked, every hole of my room was
searched, every article of my apparel was turned
over fifty times, without my being able to discover
the least symptom of the tiny blue papers for which
I was hunting. At last I gave over the search, considered
the case as hopeless, and went down stairs
again, to resume my forlorn station in the sick
chamber, where even during my short absence
matters were grown worse. Scarce had I entered it,
than I recollected that in tumbling over my wardrobe,
I had perceived the blade of an old rusty
handjar&mdash;a keep-sake from Aly&mdash;thrust half way
out of the sheath, and had met with some resistance
on trying to push it home. In the flurry of my

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

spirits, I had only curst the rusty weapon, but, on
recurring to the circumstance, a glimpse of hope
flashed upon me. Aly had taken one of my
powders after his sea-sickness, and the handjar in
question had been his acknowledgment for the relief
obtained. I ran back to my chamber, probed the
scabbard to the bottom, and, from the inmost core
of the implement of death, drew forth the last dose
of my restorative of life and health,&mdash;probably thus
untidily stowed away in some thoughtless moment.
Wrapping up the precious medicine in an embroidered
handkerchief, I ran down again to the
Bey; gave him&mdash;for fear the simple truth should
sound too homely in his ears&mdash;a pompous account
of the singular and superhuman personage to whom
I owed the gift; expatiated on the incalculable
rarity and wonderful powers of the medicine itself;
and ended by imploring him to take perhaps the
last dose of this powder of life, existing on the whole
terraqueous globe!</p>

<p>Most ready was my patron to try its efficacy;
but I had seen him swallow other medicine of less
vital importance with an ill grace, and spit out
three good quarters and a half. Fearful lest he
should serve in the same manner what I considered
his sole remaining chance of existence, I went for
some palatable vehicle, in which to secure a safe
transit to the powder.</p>

<p>Though scarcely absent two minutes, I found, on

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

my return, the face of affairs entirely changed.
The Tchibookdjee had employed the short period
of my absence to insinuate that the medicine probably
was a poison, and the giver a rogue. Of late,
I had been much with Ayoob-Bey. Ayoob indeed
was Suleiman's most intimate friend! But what
were Mamluke friendships? And my evident confusion,
my wildness, and my running in and out,
clearly bespoke a guilty mind. When, full of
exultation and hope, I offered the draught, the Bey
pushed it aside, and, without giving any reason,
said he would take no more physic. This declaration
was in itself sufficiently stunning; but much
of the mischief it implied might depend upon its
particular author.&mdash;I cast my eye leisurely round
the Mamluke circle: the Tchibookdjee looked away;
I guessed the truth, and trembled.</p>

<p>It now became necessary to insure my own
safety. I therefore said with firmness: "This
powder has some other virtues beside that of expelling
fever: it exposes calumny. Since my patron
rejects its healing powers, let it at least bear witness
to his Selim's heart;&mdash;and may God forgive the unfaithful
servant who suffers the waste of what might
have saved his master's life!"</p>

<p>Saying this, I carried the cup to my lips. My
speech had restored to the Bey his former confidence.
With all the eagerness which his debility permitted,

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

he interposed his trembling hand between the rim
and my mouth, wrested from me the draught, and,
whispering to the Tchibookdjee in a faltering accent,
"he cannot be a poisoner," at one gulp poured
down his throat the whole contents.</p>

<p>In my eagerness to do good, I certainly had not
sufficiently proportioned the dose to the weakness
of the patient. Instead of finding relief he felt
greater oppression; and soon his constitution appeared
utterly unable to struggle with the energy
of the medicine. The Mamlukes, upon this, renewed
all their former surmises, and spoke their
sentiments so loudly in the Bey's hearing, that they
seemed quite determined to justify their imputations,
cost what it might, and, in default of real
poison, to kill their patron through the fear of it.
My life seemed to hang by a thread!&mdash;Had I
dared, I should have mounted my horse, and rode
away without waiting the issue: but I saw myself
watched on all sides, and I knew that on the smallest
attempt to make my escape, I must be cut down
on the spot. Meantime a death-like paleness overspread
the Bey's countenance: his features became
fixed, and his breath ceased to be perceptible. This
was the critical moment. I gazed on his countenance
like one whose own life depended on its
changes. At last a slight dew broke out upon his
forehead:&mdash;plentiful relief soon followed. The

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

system threw off the weight which oppressed it, and
the fever abated! From that instant the Bey's
illness took a favourable turn. Every hour showed
an improvement on the preceding; and in a short
time after being to all appearance in the agony of
death, Suleiman was on his legs again as well as
ever; while&mdash;as had been predicted at the Fanar&mdash;I
fell upon mine at last, and stood proclaimed the
saver of the Bey's life.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

<div class="center" id="v2ch02">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the occasion of his recovery from the first
alarming illness which he had yet experienced,
Suleiman took with its vanquisher a less circuitous
mode than usual of showing his gratitude. He
made me at once, by a direct grant, Multezim or
proprietor of a cluster of villages near Djarrah;
and Selim Aga thus became a man of substance.
But this favour inflamed to such a degree the
jealousy and murmurings of the Bey's Mamlukes,
that he would at last, I believe, gladly have seen
me in the condition from which I rescued him,
and that, without the benefit of Eugenius's powders.
An urgent summons into his presence was the consequence.
The moment I appeared; "Selim," he
cried, "you prescribed the other day for me: I
must now prescribe for you!"</p>

<p>I thanked my patron, and assured him that the
pleasure of seeing his health restored, had put mine
beyond the reach of accident.</p>

<p>"You mistake," resumed the Bey. "I see by
your face that you are ill,&mdash;very ill indeed! The
air of Cairo disagrees with you. Take my advice,
and change it immediately for that of the healthier
province in which your property lies."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

<p>It was something to find that I was not expected
to swallow a positive dose, which I feared might cure
all my ailments too effectually. Still I considered the
prescription as indicating something critical in my
case, and exclaimed: "Say at once, Sir, that I have
lost your favour; say at once that you banish me
your presence; say that my enemies have prevailed!"</p>

<p>"To prove you mistaken," replied the Bey, "to
prove that I lose not so soon all sense of gratitude,
I add to my former gift a new one; I name you
Ca&iuml;makam<sup id="r185"><a href="#n185">185</a></sup> of Samanhood. It is a delightful place,
and your residence in your own district will season
you to the climate. On your return, you will
appear less a stranger among us."</p>

<p>From some lips, "I advise," implies "I command."
My only business therefore was to go
where bidden, as soon as invested with the insignia
of my office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, behold me now become Selim-Ca&iuml;makam!
and by the indefeasible privilege of always
rising one step at least above one's real rank, giving
myself by anticipation all the airs of Selim-Kiashef.
Not a single rayah of the inferior sort had the misfortune
to meet me in the street, whom my mokhadam<sup id="r186"><a href="#n186">186</a></sup>
forced not to jump from off his long-eared
steed, and humbly to salute me in the mire. The
great fat Frank merchants, indeed, showed themselves
as yet more firm in their seats, and these I
could thus far only indulge in the pleasure of bespattering

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

from head to foot, <i>en passant</i>, while I
promised myself ampler satisfaction on their persons
at some later period. These were the follies of my
youth;&mdash;and would that they had been the worst
for which my riper years have had to blush!</p>

<p>Suleiman's regular bazirghian<sup id="r187"><a href="#n187">187</a></sup> was the merchant,
on whom chiefly devolved the honour of fitting me
out for my lieutenancy. I chose at his shop broadcloths,
shawls, silks, muslins, armour, &amp;c. sufficient
for the equipage of a Bey. These I paid for in
orders on my villages; and as the term of payment
was distant, so was the price of the goods proportionably
high. My indignation therefore exceeded
all bounds, when, alarmed at my increasing requisitions,
the wary trader at last swore&mdash;with great apparent
concern&mdash;that he had not a strip left of the
articles I wanted. A piece of information so little
expected, put me under the disagreeable necessity of
secretly watching the entrance of some customer of
more established credit into Zohrab's shop, when,
gliding in after the new visitor, and finding the
whole counter covered with the choicest specimens
of the very goods which I had in vain demanded, I
congratulated the merchant on his seasonable supply,
swept away the whole assortment, and resold
what I could spare from my own private use.</p>

<p>Spite of Suleiman's impatience to see me gone, I
was determined to witness at Cairo the opening of
the Kalish. Rather than lose that festivity I chose

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

to sprain my ankle, and limped to the show. Among
the valuable articles which I had bought to do honour
to my government, shone pre-eminent a fine
samoor<sup id="r188"><a href="#n188">188</a></sup> pelisse. This costly fur I was dying to display
at the f&ecirc;te; and caught a cold on purpose to
wrap myself in it in the midst of the dog-days: nor
did I stir a step except in my pelisse. The very
mob raved of its beauty; and one youth in particular
eyed it with such intense adoration, that, unable to
possess himself of the whole, he cut off the left sleeve
while it swung at my back; and bore the important
appendage away as a relic. It was mortifying to
learn my loss from some persons behind me, in the
very midst of my happiness. The sleeve indeed
might be replaced, but the pelisse could no longer
be worn that day, and with a deep sigh I sent it
home. Scarce, however, had its mangled body
reached my door, than after it walked in the severed
limb. Dropped, in the confusion of the place, by
the thief, the precious fragment had been picked up
by an honest fellow, who by the greatest good luck
happened to be a tailor into the bargain, and offered
to wield his needle with such diligence, as in a trice
to enable the signor Ca&iuml;makam to resume his robe
of state. The honest fellow's services were accepted:
the cloak was given him, and he retired to
work in a little back chamber.</p>

<p>Unluckily this room&mdash;besides a door&mdash;also had a
window; and, having come in at the one, my friend

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

chose, for variety, to go out at the other. On my
looking in to hasten the business, tailor, cloak, and
sleeve had disappeared together, nor have they ever
since been heard of. I applied to the Schaich or
chief of the robbers at Cairo, who, for a certain consideration,
undertakes to restore stolen goods; and
during the sultriest season of the year had every
day fifty pelisses of cat and rabbit skin brought me
to examine; but not one of samoor!</p>

<p>Spite of my loss I proceeded on my journey.
According to the custom of the country, I was accompanied
by some of the fellahs<sup id="r189"><a href="#n189">189</a></sup> of my own estate,
to serve me as a sort of hostages for the good behaviour
of my remaining serfs; and, in addition to
these, had, by way of retinue, four black slaves for
the service of my person, three hawarees or Barbaresque
horsemen for the protection of my vassals,
half a dozen kawasses<sup id="r190"><a href="#n190">190</a></sup> to clear my way of canaille,
and four or five sa&iuml;s, or grooms, to take care of my
stud. This latter consisted, besides the steeds we
mounted, of three or four fine led horses for show,
as many mules for use, and a dromedary for flight,
should circumstances render a retrograde movement
expedient. As to asses for incognito expeditions,
they were, thank God! to be found at every turn.
This little assortment of bipeds and quadrupeds,&mdash;extended
on as long a line as possible,&mdash;formed a
very respectable procession, and quite sufficient to
make passengers inquire and have an opportunity

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

of learning, that it was Selim-Ca&iuml;makam on his way
to his government.</p>

<p>I began my journey by land, and, spite of the
humble entreaties of the Schaichs and Shehoods<sup id="r191"><a href="#n191">191</a></sup> of
the different places where I halted, preferred pitching
my tents in the open air, to lodging in the close
and miserable hovels of the towns and villages; but
I took care that the inhabitants should lose nothing
by the great man keeping aloof: and consoled them
by sending for as much provision of every sort as I
could manage to consume or carry. The Schaich-el-belled
of each district is obliged to supply the public
officers on their route at the expense of the district;
in consequence of which excellent regulation I should
never have given up the more economical way of
travelling by land, for the more expensive conveyance
by water, had not some of the kiashefs on my
way been most inconveniently engaged in hostility
with the neighbouring Arabs. This rendered part
of the road insecure; and, as I had but an inadequate
force, I resolved, after three or four days
march along the banks of the Nile, to contend with
its adverse current; myself in a light khandgea,<sup id="r192"><a href="#n192">192</a></sup>
which went on before, and the bulk of my equipage
in a larger and heavier boat behind.</p>

<p>In consequence of the adventure of my pelisse,
I had conceived the erroneous notion that the
thieves of Cairo far excelled in skill those of the
provinces. This opinion, so injurious to the latter,

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

maturer experience enabled me to correct. One
evening, advancing with a fresh breeze pretty rapidly
against the stream, our ears were suddenly
struck by the noise of a heavy body, plumping into
the waves; and inexpressible was my surprise and
concern when, running to the stern of the boat, I
beheld this body to be that of my best mare; and
when I saw the faithless Noorshah, whom I thought
I had left tied fast by the legs, swimming away to
the land with all her might. Unable to guess the
cause of this strange freak, I did all in my power
to entice the beast back. In vain!&mdash;&mdash;As if bewitched,
the more she heard me call the faster she
swam; so that at last I gave orders to tack and row
after the fugitive with all possible speed. Noorshah
however reached the bank about fifty yards in advance
of her old master, and no sooner had she
touched the shore, than out came the secret, in the
shape of a thief, who, to my inexpressible horror,
started up from behind the animal, cut the strings
that confined its legs, pressed its loins with his own
bandy shanks, and scampered off. By diving all
the way, the scoundrel had contrived to reach the
boat unperceived, had crept in by favour of the dusk,
had slipped under the mare, and, by raising his
back under her belly, had tilted her over into the
water; when, confined as were her extremities, it
became an easy task to push her to the land. Unfortunately
the boasted speed of the animal put out

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

of question all chance of successful pursuit; and
Noorshah was placed in my memory, with the
pelisse, among the things that had been.</p>

<p>At Mamfloot I again quitted the khandgea.
Only five or six days journey now separated me
from my new district, which bordered upon the
province of Djirdg&eacute;; and the road bore a good
character.</p>

<p>On the third morning of my progress, however, I
began to doubt its claims. All the inhabitants young
and old of the first village we passed through,
were under arms; some carrying clubs, others
stones, and, the most distinguished, a rusty sword
or a worn-out matchlock. The enemy against
whom they marched, drawn out in the most martial
array on the brow of an eminence hard by, were
the inhabitants of the next village; and, inquiring
into the cause of hostilities, all the information I
could get was that nobody knew the date of its
first beginning. The origin of the hereditary animosity
between the two districts lay concealed in
the obscurity of ages; but its virulence remained
not the less unimpaired:&mdash;it had been laudably
kept up by as many subsequent injuries and retaliations
as other business permitted; and to my great
edification I understood that, however completely
the first cause of the enmity might be forgotten, it
was only the more implacable on that account.</p>

<p>Though gratified by so praiseworthy a spirit, I

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

judged nevertheless that it might admit of some
modification, and took the liberty to represent that,
even supposing the happiness of the community to
be quite beyond enduring, I still thought that certain
regular drawbacks&mdash;such as contributions to the
Sultan, taxes imposed by the Beys, provisions
claimed by travelling officers like myself, exactions
of avaricious landlords, depredations committed by
wandering Arabs, and yearly encroachments of the
sand on the cultivable soil, together with the incidental
circumstances of locusts, plague, imperfect
irrigation, mortality and famine&mdash;might, upon the
whole, qualify it sufficiently, without the gratuitous
addition of civil warfare and bloodshed between
neighbours, begun without a cause, and carried on
without an object!</p>

<p>This civil remonstrance, I rejoiced to find, made
a great impression. Not a single objection was
raised, and my speech&mdash;frequently interrupted by
cries of, "listen, listen!"&mdash;seemed to obtain universal
approbation. The auditors thanked me
humbly for my good advice: when I departed,
they remained for a considerable time immoveable
on the spot; and only after I and mine were quite
out of sight, they proceeded on, and gave their
enemies (as I have since understood) the bloodiest
battle on record in their annals.</p>

<p>After nearly four weeks spent on the road, I
found myself at last, to my great satisfaction, approaching

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

the conclusion of my tedious journey. In
the midst of a deep reverie I was suddenly aroused
by the loud shouts of my suite, at the sight of my
capital. Already delighted with these welcome
sounds, I expected to be soon still more so by the
appearance of my subjects, drawn out in due state
to meet their new governor, with drums beating and
colours flying. "How long they must have been
watching my arrival!" thought I, and spurred my
horse on, straining both eyes and ears to discover
some distant stir; but no symptom of bustle being
yet discernible, I again slackened my pace, in order
to give leisure for the procession to advance. Vain
considerateness! I might proceed as slow as I pleased,
not a creature appeared, early or late, to welcome
my arrival; and I had to enter my capital unhonoured
with the smallest notice. Matters mended
not even as I penetrated deeper into the town.
Every street or lane which I successively entered
looked peculiarly forlorn. Every door and window
was as empty as if the city had been visited by the
plague; and the inhabitants, so far from impeding
my passage by their congratulations, seemed, on the
contrary, to have all fled from their homes at my
approach. Inconceivably mortified, I fell into a
state of such complete abstraction that&mdash;no longer
minding what I was about&mdash;I crossed my capital
(which, to say the truth, was not among the largest)
through and through, and again issued forth at the

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

opposite extremity from that at which I had entered,
so as to leave my destined residence wholly behind
me, and to continue on in full march toward the
Sa&iuml;d. In fact, I would have proceeded in this way
to the very end of the world, had not all at once my
ears been assailed by a prodigious clamour, raised
a hundred yards or two in my rear. It was that of
no less than all the Schaichs, Shehoods and notables
of the place collected, who, seeing me thus contemptuously
turn my back upon my new subjects,
and run away from my government, were in full
cry at my heels, to stop my alarming progress.
Unfortunately the discord of their shouts had the
contrary effect from that which they intended. Imagining
it in my abstraction to be some fray in which
I had no concern, I only spurred my horse on the
faster, and the more pertinaciously the procession
pursued me, the harder I galloped: until one of
my own suite, who had learnt the truth, at last got
me to hear him, and rectified my mistake. My
subjects, poor creatures! had only appeared remiss
from an excess of loyalty. Apprised that I drew
near, they had, early in the morning, taken their
station where they expected me to enter their city:&mdash;totally
forgetting a bad pass in the road, which compelled
me to make a circuit, and thereby obliged
my subjects to run after their governor, instead of
advancing in due state to meet him face to face.
Matters now were soon brought to an amicable understanding,

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

and I turned back without any other
ill consequence arising from the mistake, except that
of the whole procession&mdash;governor and governed&mdash;entering
the town the wrong end foremost.</p>

<p>It had been sheer modesty in me not to expect
a capital at least equal to Raschid or to Fooah.
When, therefore, on looking round, I saw how little
the real dimensions of my residence agreed with
those assigned to it in my imagination, my first impulse
was to accuse Suleiman of having treated me
with disrespect. Time only inspired me with more
reasonable sentiments;&mdash;time only taught me that
mine was a situation not of amusement but of
profit: but by degrees my docile intellect became
so thoroughly imbued with this principle, that,
through dint of unabating diligence, I was at last able
to tell to a fraction of a para what each feddan of
ground might yield, and each head of man or beast
thereto belonging be chargeable for, whether to the
Multezim, the lieutenant, the governor, or the miri.<sup id="r193"><a href="#n193">193</a></sup></p>

<p>After these severer studies, letting leases, imposing
contributions, levying fines, receiving presents, and
inflicting penalties were only my pastimes. Indeed,
as the Egyptian fellah makes it a matter of conscience
never to pay his rent, until compelled by main force,
and wears the stripes he has incurred in his resistance
as badges of honour, my financial operations sometimes
even afforded me a fair field for the exercise
of my warlike propensities: not but what my genius&mdash;even
in its fullest exertions in that line&mdash;still

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

shrunk into absolute insignificance before that of my
Coobtic writer, who, with a salary of six medeens a
day, and a large family to maintain, had become by
mere saving as rich as a Sultan's seraf. It is true
that whenever he drew a para out of his vest, it was
as if he tore his very vitals out of his bosom. Once,
indeed, I tried to throw some light upon the intricacies
of his accounts, but those of the labyrinth
of Crete would have been less perplexing. When
I complained of the easy honesty of this worthy
personage to my confidential servant, I found
little sympathy. Seyed shrugged up his shoulders;
owned that certain things might be tiresome,&mdash;but
they were the regular practice. If the Coobd
cheated the Multezim, did not the Multezim in the
same way cheat the Ca&iuml;makam, and the Ca&iuml;makam
the Kiashef, and the Kiashef the Bey, and the Bey
the Schaich-el-belled, and the Schaich-el-belled the
Pasha, and the Pasha the Porte, and the Porte the
Sultan? who&mdash;he was very sure&mdash;cheated Allah
himself, when he assumed the title of Kaliph of the
faithful.</p>

<p>The only thing I could see through tolerably
were the decisions of the cadee, which I sometimes
went to witness at the mekkiem&eacute;. In Egypt as
elsewhere, the conjugal union seemed to be in all its
various stages the most universal source of discord,
and subject of litigation. One day there appeared
a fair one, entitled thus far only to the blushing
honours of a bride, who, on being conducted in state

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

to her bridegroom, had been refused admittance, and
had found herself compelled to return as she went.
Another day came a wife regularly installed. She,
poor woman! had been dispossessed less openly, but
of rights already exercised, and now claimed her long
unpaid dues with arrears of interest: and on another
occasion in walked a mourning widow; who, still
as much in love with her dead husband as while he
was alive, only demanded the empty gratification
of nightly visiting his grave, unimpeded by her
churlish relations. She was pretty; her grief affected
me, and once or twice I went to the scene of
her affliction, to mix my tears with hers.</p>

<p>In Europe, the law, they say, demands a long
apprenticeship: it is not so among Mohammedans.
The Koran and its commentaries decide every case,
from a point of faith to a right of gutter, in a very
few seconds. The form of trial is simple. Every
man pleads his own cause; and wonderful is the
readiness of the Egyptians in finding answers to
every interrogatory, excuses for every action, witnesses
to every fact, and sureties for every engagement.
I remember a poor fellow, who, called upon
for his respondents, and having none on earth, had
recourse to heaven. Imam Aly was the one he
chose: nor dared the other contracting party, albeit
somewhat startled, both at the distance of the saint's
abode and at the difficulty of enforcing his appearance,
refuse so respectable a security.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

<p>My stay was long enough in my lieutenancy to
find that peculiar subject of discourse the most interesting,
which I had once thought the most tiresome;
I mean, the rise of the Nile. By degrees I
could think of no other. Yet was it this season
a source of no very cheering contemplation. The
river&mdash;as if in a trance&mdash;displayed such unusual
tardiness in rising, that soon every district trembled
lest its waters should fail of attaining the requisite
height. Nothing was heard but lamentations and
complaints. One came to tell me of canals which
not a drop of moisture reached; another, of such as
had been drained prematurely of their insufficient
contents. Here the legal period for cutting a dam
had been wholly disregarded; there a single field
had been made to engross the supply of a whole
district: every where it seemed as if the dread of a
scarcity had made man exert his utmost ingenuity
to render a famine unavoidable.</p>

<p>I now became haunted by the phantom of
drought, the most dreary that stalks over Egypt's
thirsty plains. My thoughts by day, and my dreams
by night, equally presented to me its ever extending,
blasting form, followed by the whole train of its
frightful offspring: unirrigated tracts, fields remaining
fallow, insufficient crops, farmers unable to
pay their contributions, peasants abandoning their
villages, whole troops of fellahs leaving their possessions
and their homes to till the land of the

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

stranger, impositions to remit, short rents to receive
for the Bey; and the Ca&iuml;makam alone held accountable
for all the deficiencies of nature, and all the
waywardness of man. O! how earnestly did I
now pray for some lucky incident, which might
release me from my stewardship and responsibility!
But of such a piece of good fortune I entertained
no hopes.</p>

<p>It however came, and when it came, it failed
of its promised pleasure. One morning, as I sat
puzzling over some of my writer's explanations, in
walked a smooth-spoken gentleman, who, followed
by a whole body of less engaging satellites, in a civil
tone informed me that he came to take my place,
and, lest I should doubt his word, handed me an injunction
from the Bey to return forthwith to Cairo.
This unlooked-for recall produced such a revolution
in my sentiments, that I now would gladly have
given just as much to retain, as I would have done
the instant before, to get rid of my trust. It is true
that to my concern for what I left was to be added
my apprehension of what I might find. So sudden
a removal, so little accounted for, savoured of a
disgrace. I doubted not but my enemies had
improved my absence to undermine my favour.
The Tchibookdjee was evidently at the bottom of
the whole affair; and, as I had already vowed the
insidious pipe-bearer an eternal hatred, I could now
only add the vow of a speedy revenge.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

<p>Absorbed in my meditations on the best mode
of executing what, but for the consequences, was
feasible a thousand ways, I one day, on my homeward
journey, rode on so fast as to get entirely out
of sight of my suite, when suddenly I found myself
breast to breast with a troop of Bedoween Arabs,
whose low dusky tents, pitched behind a sand-hill,
had remained concealed from my view, till I almost
stumbled over their inclosure. The same instant the
chief of the tribe, followed by half a dozen of its
ragged members, advanced upon me with couched
spears, demanding either a hundred sequins for my
passage, or all I possessed. Neither of these proposals
suited me; but my retinue amounted not to one
fourth of that of the Arabs, and it seemed quite
certain that if it came to blows, we must have the
worst of the fray:&mdash;wherefore&mdash;without advancing,
but without either answering the summons, I turned
round to the foremost men of my escort, who by this
time had approached within reach, and bid them fill
a basket with ball and cartridge. This ammunition
I sent to the Bedoweens: telling them at the same
time that it was the only coin in which I paid impositions:
but, if not content with the quantity, they
might&mdash;I added&mdash;as soon as my army came up,
have more of it,&mdash;and that, sent by the speediest
conveyance possible. This rodomontade took effect.
The Schaich received the gift with thanks, filled the
basket in return with super-excellent dates, and

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

bade me pass on, with the salutation of peace. This
civility I most readily returned; nor waited until
my army should be in sight, to hurry with all possible
speed out of that of the Arabs.</p>

<p>Brooding all the way to Cairo over the cause of
my recall, I could scarce avoid, on my entrance
into the capital, reading in every countenance the
confirmation of my disgrace. This idea made me
conceal my own features in my shawl, till I reached
the palace. There, meeting at the gate an old and
confidential comrade, I gave vent for the first time
to my apprehensions, and by way of obtaining, without
asking it, more explicit information respecting
the man&oelig;uvres of the Tchibookdjee, cried out:
"I was come to look after Osman."&mdash;"God forbid!"
was the only answer I received.</p>

<p>But these few words, with the addition of an
ominous smile, sufficed to complete the subversion
of my senses.&mdash;I rushed up stairs, flew into the Bey's
apartment, and hardly allowing myself time to perform
a respectful salutation: "Sir," cried I, in
scarce articulate sounds, "Osman, I know, will
never cease his machinations, until he has entirely
ruined me in your esteem!"</p>

<p>"If so," coolly answered the Bey, "your
knowledge far exceeds in its reach even what I
imagined; nor did I think poor Osman still continued
to disturb your repose, after being himself laid
at rest for ever."</p>

<p>"How!" cried I&mdash;more bewildered than before&mdash;"is

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

Osman dead?" "And what else," replied the
Bey, "do you think could have made me send for
you in such haste? What but the means of now
conferring upon you without any obstacle.........
but you are too much agitated to listen. I must
wait till to-morrow to unfold my designs. Meanwhile,
go, and compose yourself."</p>

<p>I went, but whether I obeyed the sequel of the
injunction, need scarcely be told. My imagination,
always ardent enough, had been set in a complete
blaze; and, burning with impatience to learn my
new destinies, I only felt my agitation changed in
its object, without being in the least diminished in
its intensity. The whole night my brains were kept
on the stretch to clothe into some definite shape the
Bey's vague and desultory hints; and in my anxious
wish for the day that was to clear up the mystery,
I began to think night had overslept herself, and
the morning, pregnant with my future fate, would
never arrive.</p>

<p>At last it duly shone upon the world, and the
summons to my patron's chamber greeted my impatient
ear. Left with him in much-portending
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, he looked at me, smiled to see the
eagerness depicted in my countenance, hemmed
twice or thrice for no purpose but to increase the
fever of my spirits, and, having asked me some
trifling questions, which I answered without well
knowing what they were&mdash;at last began his discourse.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

<div class="center" id="v2ch03">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Selim</span>,"&mdash;said Suleiman in all the solemnity of
a set speech,&mdash;"you have seen our two leaders, and
seldom, I should think, can have observed two
personages more unlike both in mind and in body.
The short spare form, the mild countenance, the
insinuating address, the cautious calculating turn
of the Schaich-el-belled could not find a greater
contrast than in the ferocious features, the colossal
frame, the voice of thunder, the violent temper, the
fearlessness of danger, the impatience of control,
and the prodigality of disposition of his blustering
colleague. Little of union might be expected between
qualities so dissimilar; and, in fact, the
public at large, which sees Ibrahim ever prefer
artifice to force and negotiation to war, while
Mourad openly professes to hold in his sword his
only instrument of persuasion, regards these two
chiefs as constantly on the eve of a rupture, and
about to hoist the standard of interminable enmity.
But we who observe more closely, have lost all
hopes on that head.&mdash;We can only, when Ibrahim
and Mourad affect to be at variance, view in their
reciprocal strictures upon each other, studied sallies

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

carefully rehearsed beforehand by the performers,
with the view to mask their schemes, and to mislead
their rivals. Each appreciates in his heart
at its true value, that difference of disposition
from the other, which gives him in his associate
precisely all he wants in himself, and makes Mourad
cut asunder the knot which Ibrahim cannot untie,
as it again enables Ibrahim to cure by his management
the wounds which Mourad has inflicted by
his rashness. Thus it is that the dissimilar qualities
of the two chiefs&mdash;like the gold and the steel of a
Damascus blade&mdash;only form a closer amalgam, and
leave less hopes of those chasms and fissures in their
union, at which competitors insinuate themselves to
divide a party, to drive its members asunder, and
to rise on its ruins!</p>

<p>"Some of us therefore,&mdash;Ibrahim-Bey Sogeir,
Osman-Bey Tcherkavi, Mustapha-Bey Skanderani,
Ayoob-Bey the lesser and myself,&mdash;have at last
agreed upon uniting our strength, in order to bring
these all-grasping leaders to a more equal division
of the spoil; and even Ayoob-Bey Kebir, Youssoof-Bey,
and Isma&iuml;l-Bey Sogeir, though they still
seem to waver, only do so, in order that they may sell
their co-operation at a higher price. Their irresolute
and doubtful conduct, however, would have made
us put off the execution of our design until it had
had time to acquire greater consistency, did not the
present juncture offer advantages which perhaps

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

may never hereafter recur. Isma&iuml;l and Hassan,
after their long sleep at Es-souan, are at last roused,
and prepare for a descent to Cairo. Aware how
little our assistance is to be depended on, should
the capital be made the field of battle, the leaders
have thought it advisable to hush the storm, if
possible, in its very cradle, and Mourad is going to
march to the Sa&iuml;d, while Ibrahim stays to awe us
at Cairo. Thus separated from his colleague, and
deprived of half his strength, the Schaich-el-belled
must, if attacked with vigour, yield to our united
force: and in order to be in readiness for the day
of trial, we are all busy in recalling with the least
possible show our adherents from the different
provinces. This made me summon you from your
government with that abruptness from which you
drew such unfounded conclusions. You now know
the great secret for which your presence was wanted;
and all that I have to add is the strongest recommendation
that it may never pass your lips."</p>

<p>Here my patron,&mdash;rising from his seat,&mdash;marked
the end of his discourse. The conclusion fell somewhat
short of my expectations. Great undoubtedly
to one like me was the satisfaction of learning that
all the world was going to unsheath sword and dagger;
but still I had looked forward to the disclosure
of some more directly personal advantage. It however
occurred to me that whatever new favour
Suleiman might destine his servant, was probably

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

deferred to a later conference, on very purpose lest
it should appear the consequence only of his necessities;
which circumstance being made due allowance
for, I humbly thanked him for his expenditure of
breath, made every requisite profession of attachment,
fidelity, and zeal; and respectfully retired.</p>

<p>A slave of Ayoob's had been waiting for my appearance
near the gate of the palace. The moment
I went forth he came up to me, and, rather in a
mysterious manner, whispered an invitation to his
master's palace, which I obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>As soon as Ayoob saw me: "Signor Ca&iuml;makam,"
cried he in his eager way, wholly unlike that of his
brethren&mdash;true volcanos wrapt in snow, "a most
extraordinary occurrence has happened. It is still
a secret to all, save the parties concerned; and you
are the first stranger destined to learn the wonderful
event!</p>

<p>"You know," continued he after a short pause
to fetch breath, "that since I cannot have my
Mamlukes of my own blood, I at least spare neither
money nor pains to have them of my own country&mdash;my
beloved Gurgistan. Doomed to live and to die
in this distant region, whoever comes from the land
of my birth seems to me a relation. Not many
days ago my harem was enriched with a new bud
reared in the parent soil. In order to save the
maiden from the rapacity of her landlord, her
friends were going to place her under the protection

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

of a husband, at the tender age of eleven: but
already they had deferred their purpose too long.
Her wedding-day was fixed, when an armed troop
swept the district, and made her a slave ere she was
become a wife.</p>

<p>"Brought hither to adorn my garden, this lovely
rose of the East became my favourite flower: yet
had I the forbearance, ere with eager hand I placed
it in my bosom, to observe our sacred custom,&mdash;to
inquire on what stem it had grown, and what walls
had sheltered its infancy from the rough blasts of
heaven, and the rude touch of man? Selim&mdash;would
you believe it? In my slave I found a sister!</p>

<p>"The virgin blushing before me, was my own
father's daughter: was a young and solitary shoot,
which, long after the elder branches had been severed
from the parent stock, seemed springing up
for the sole purpose of shading, with fresh and
tender foliage, its bare and withering top. For the
first time during my twenty years sojourn in Egypt
I heard the voice of kindred, and felt the ties of
blood.</p>

<p>"But what is this to you? Listen! and you
shall hear."</p>

<p>Here Ayoob gave me nearly the same sketch of
the state of affairs and of the views of the party, as
Suleiman had done before: except that he spoke
of himself as more decided in his sentiments than
he had been represented by my patron. I began

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

to fear that I had twice in one day been inveigled
by a hope of personal advantage, into listening to a
long detail of other people's concerns. But mark
the sequel!</p>

<p>"At a moment so critical"&mdash;continued Ayoob&mdash;"I
naturally feel anxious to surround myself with
men, who to such bravery as depends not on the
fumes of hashish<sup id="r194"><a href="#n194">194</a></sup> add such intelligence and skill as
may render that courage useful. Of men of this
description, small, alas! is the number; but you
are one, and I may now freely urge your devoting
your future existence to my house, since it affords
me&mdash;God be praised!&mdash;the means of rewarding
your services.</p>

<p>"The husband my sister lost in Gurgistan, we
must find for her at Cairo:&mdash;yet, what man is there
among my own Mamlukes, worthy of the honour of
so great an alliance, and able at the same time to
requite it by undivided attention? The elder individuals
of my household are already established;
and the younger have not yet accomplished their
probation. To you therefore I offer Zelidah's youthful
hand; to you, who may become my own support
as well as my sister's solace! Let me however
add that this proposal would never have passed my
lips, while Suleiman your old patron continued faithful
to his promise; but since&mdash;for what reason I
know not&mdash;he resigns his claims upon a faithful
servant, I may, without scruple, offer you all I can

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

bestow,&mdash;an alliance with my blood, a share in my
honours, and a home in my house."</p>

<p>At this overture, I felt utterly confounded. It
filled me with pleasure, but at the same time with
anxiety. I knew not how to choose between the
brilliant offer which came unexpectedly, and the
expected favours as yet unbestowed. I dared not
hope that Suleiman's thus far undisclosed designs
would ever gratify my ambition beyond Ayoob's
avowed intentions; but then again, I saw no means
of attaching myself to Ayoob, without setting at
nought the debt of gratitude, and the duties of the
allegiance which I owed to Suleiman. In this dilemma
between the certain and the promised boon,
I magnanimously determined to make the proposals
of the strange Bey, in the first instance, instrumental
only in bringing to the test the munificence
of my own patron,&mdash;reserving their final acceptance
or refusal for a later period; and, in a speech
brimful of those high-flown nothings called thanks,
begged Ayoob's permission to ask Suleiman's consent,
ere I changed my allegiance: observing that
so far from my favour at home being on the decline,
it stood higher than ever; and, in order to confirm
this assertion, representing by a little transposition
of the future to the past, those honours which I still
expected, as already come to pass, and only for
political purposes kept as yet unpublished.</p>

<p>Ayoob seemed not much to relish the idea of

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

having his splendid offers only accepted conditionally,
or his liberality submitted to the discussion of
a rival; and swore by his beard he thought it very
strange: but seeing me inflexible on this point,
"Then go," said he at last, "since you will be so
obstinate; but remind Suleiman that if he stops
the current of my intended bounty, his own should
make you unbounded amends; and above all, stay
not long. An hour is the utmost I can bear to be
left, with my richest gifts thus hanging unaccepted
on my hands."</p>

<p>I promised to return in much less time; and
flew home as on the wings of lightning, to communicate
to my patron the substance of the interview
with his colleague. On hearing of Ayoob's offers,
Suleiman reddened, and seemed offended. "By
the head of our holy prophet," he cried in a tone of
bitterness, "my brother the Georgian uses me ill:
but these are times in which we must hush our resentments;
and <i>this</i> Ayoob knows. You, Selim,
I cannot blame: the offers of my insidious colleague
took you by surprise, and you could not stop your
ears. I however feel happy that, ere my rival
made his proposal, I hinted the new favours with
which I myself purposed to crown your zeal. You
might otherwise suspect me of only acting from the
fear of being out-bidden. Now mark me. My
oldest kiashef, Mooktar, is married, as you know,
to my first born daughter. My second kiashef to

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

her sister next in age. My other children, already
sent forth into the world, are provided for in different
ways adequate to their deserts. Thank God!
I have been able to make all my freedmen lords.
My haznadar,<sup id="r195"><a href="#n195">195</a></sup>&mdash;first in rank of those still under
my roof&mdash;I cannot yet afford to part with, and I do
not wish to conceal from you that had Osman lived,
his name would have graced the nuptial song, sung
in honour of my youngest girl. But Providence
has called him away, and none of his comrades are
yet entitled to an alliance with their patron's blood.
I may therefore indulge the suggestions of my
heart, by giving you my only remaining daughter.
It is true, the man she marries must hold a high
station: but this also I confer. I name you kiashef.
Remember, however, that as my favours are great,
so will your duties be arduous.&mdash;Of our intended
plan of insurrection, the success may depend in a
great measure upon your devotion, your skill, and
your activity!"</p>

<p>To this hour I value rank: it is reverenced by
fools; and fools form the major number. In the
first aspirings of youth, so vast an accession of
honours as that offered me by Suleiman almost
overpowered my senses. It scarce left me able to
make my patron the proper acknowledgment for
his liberality, ere I retired out of his sight, to give
vent to my emotions.</p>

<p>"I shall then see myself a kiashef!" exclaimed
I aloud, whirling round like a top, in an ecstacy of

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

joy; "I shall then, every time I stir out, behold
dancing before me those dear damasked spears
which I so often have coveted! I shall appear
abroad only with a handsome retinue, and at home
possess my own separate establishment and harem!
No longer a mere graft on a strange tree, I shall
cast my own roots in the soil, and on my own independent
stem bear my own separate fruits. This
chin of mine shall henceforth cease to be kept close
mown, and shall put forth unrestrained its most
luxuriant crops!"<sup id="r196"><a href="#n196">196</a></sup> And immediately, with the
anxiety of the husbandman, eager to ascertain whether
in his field the budding blade comes up close
and strong, I ran to a glass to see whether my
broad jaw promised to bear a thick and handsome
beard; already began to coax and to perfume, by
anticipation, the still sleek unclothed skin; traced
in imagination the symmetric outline of its future
jetty fringe, and wondered how the new appendage
would become the remainder of my manly features!</p>

<p>My raptures lasted some time, ere I remembered
that I had promised Ayoob an immediate answer;
and as soon as my memory returned, my imagination
began to wander;&mdash;I became suddenly seized
with a romantic fit. The substantial advantages
were nearly balanced in the rival offers; but as
honour threw its additional weight into the scale of
my patron, I took it into my foolish head, that
beauty must preponderate in that of Ayoob. In
short, I persuaded myself that Zelidah&mdash;by birth

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

a Georgian, and by condition a slave&mdash;must be as
superior in personal charms to Khadidg&eacute;, a daughter
of Egypt and a descendant of rulers, as the fairest
lily is to the dusky bulrush; and determined, at
every risk, to see Ayoob's sister ere I decided.</p>

<p>A jewess of my acquaintance was the chief purveyor
of female finery for Ayoob's harem. I went
straight to this useful person, and made her instantly
collect some of the richest stuffs she could find:
then put on the blue shift and chequered veil of the
Egyptian women of the lower order; and, in Sarah's
unassuming suite, loaded with all her heaviest packages,
proceeded to Ayoob's palace&mdash;now and then
sharply reproved by the way, for my long strides
and strapping gait.</p>

<p>Zelidah, when we arrived, was unfortunately in
the bath, and signora Sarah had to wait. In order
to be less conspicuous the while, I squatted myself
down on the floor, in the darkest part of the room.
Even this had too much light to conceal me from
Ayoob, who, whether informed of the entrance of a
suspicious figure, or from some other cause, himself
unexpectedly made his appearance, as if to see his
sister. The moment his eye fell upon the bundle
into which I had transformed my person, his countenance
changed, his brow became contracted, and
he rushed out again, muttering to himself some
words of ungracious import, and not at all complimentary
to somebody's mother.<sup id="r197"><a href="#n197">197</a></sup> At this ill-boding

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

symptom, the jewess turned pale, and striking her
breast,&mdash;"I have brought," cried she, "the thing I
should not, and have left behind what I meant to
have brought! Go, Dalla; run home, fetch the
tissue we were talking of, and return not without it."</p>

<p>Scarce had the words been uttered, when heavy
footsteps were heard to approach the place. Active
as she was, Dalla had but just time to make her
escape, and to reach the outer gate without hinderance.
Running home as fast as possible, I cast
off my disguise, and immediately hastened back to
Ayoob, in my proper form and character.</p>

<p>With many apologies for the unavoidable delay, I
now solemnly declined the Bey's offers, but in terms
full of regret, of gratitude, and of protestations. The
answer was in the same strain, though, as I thought,
delivered somewhat coolly, and in a ruffled manner:
and I afterwards understood from the jewess, who
had bravely remained at her post, that in less than
half a minute after I had made my exit, Ayoob reappeared
in the harem, followed by a host of black
eunuchs, and looking blacker than any of his suite.
He again cast round an inquiring eye; and in seeming
disappointment asked what was become of the
Egyptian woman. Sarah told off-hand some just
possible story, and, expressing a shrewd doubt of
her servant's finding the stuff she wanted, went home
herself, too happy at encountering no impediment.
Thus ended my courtship with the fair Zelidah!</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

<p>The instant Suleiman's intentions in my behalf
became known, the greatest discontent showed
itself among his Mamlukes. "Their patron," they
asserted, "had no right to give his daughters to
any but Mamlukes, or to make Mamlukes any
but purchased slaves. Othman-Bey Aboo-se&iuml;f and
Achmet-Bey el Sukari, Turks by nature, and Beys
by the favour of Ibrahim Kehaya, though precedents,
were not examples. The oftener such
abuses occurred, the more they ought to be resisted."
At last, losing my temper at these repeated
murmurings, I went hot with passion to
complain to my patron. "Sir," cried I, "your
Mamlukes judge me unworthy of your favours.
Permit me to make them repent of their insolence&mdash;equally
insulting to yourself and to your servant,&mdash;or
suffer me to renounce your kindness, and bid
Egypt farewell."</p>

<p>At these words the Bey only stared full in my
face, and set up a loud laugh; but perceiving that
I joined not in his mirth, and continued immoveably
grave, he too, by degrees, dropped his assumed
gaiety, and in a serious tone replied, "If, Selim,
you really feel desirous to leave me, go! Why should
I detain your person, when I cannot prevent the
estrangement of your mind? But," continued he,
raising his voice till it sounded like thunder, while
he darted looks fierce as lightning round the Mamluke
circle, "I acknowledge not yet my slaves as

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

my masters. Let them harmlessly sharpen with
kohl<sup id="r198"><a href="#n198">198</a></sup> the soft glances of their eyes, but let them
repress the more offensive sallies of their tongues.
Too soon may the voice of this presumptuous cast
cease to be heard in Cairo! Too soon may we
be too happy to replenish our thinning ranks with
men, not worthy to wield the sword of him, whom
these young fools abuse!"</p>

<p>This speech&mdash;supported by a letter from Suleiman's
kehaya at Constantinople, read aloud to the
bystanders, in which the trusty agent actually complained
that the slave market was empty, that the
Russian she-emperor had, out of mere spite, made
the Padi-shah<sup id="r199"><a href="#n199">199</a></sup> renounce the living tribute, yearly
claimed from the Crimea; and that it was feared the
whole world meant soon to be at peace,&mdash;gave me
some comfort, and my enemies more discretion.</p>

<p>My marriage being fixed, the wedding-day was
soon announced. Meanwhile, every hour intervening
seemed an age. I longed to possess a wife
who, if she could not be an object of love, must be
an earnest of promotion; and I was dying to have
in a harem of my own a sanctuary, where, even
though my person should be proscribed, my wealth
still must remain inviolate, and my dear sequins
undisturbed!</p>

<p>All things being ready for my nuptials, the ceremony
began. My bride was conducted to the bath
in state, lest the world should remain in ignorance

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

of her cleanliness. Properly steamed, jointed, and
pumiced, she next went through the labours of
a toilet so exquisite, that on its completion not
one among her beauties remained nature's own.
Several hours were employed in twisting her hair
into the semblance of whipcord; in adding two
hundred and fifty false plaits to the hundred and
fifty which grew from her head; and in forming
the joint mass into an edifice so ponderous, that a
second head, merely for use, would have been very
acceptable. A pair of eyebrows, sufficiently notable
in themselves, were only dismissed the artificer's
hands, after being shaped into two exact semicircles:
and a pair of eyes, expressive enough without foreign
assistance, were not deemed to possess all their requisite
powers, until framed in two black cases of
surmeh.<sup id="r200"><a href="#n200">200</a></sup> Henna,<sup id="r201"><a href="#n201">201</a></sup> the symbol of joy, and already
most profusely lavished upon the epistles which
communicated my marriage to my patron's numerous
clients, but bestowed in still greater profusion
on my bride's own plump and lustrous
person, made it emulate the colour which I suppose
Isis displayed, when doomed to roam through
Egypt's plains in the undignified shape of a red cow.
After all these pains taken for the sake of beauty,
the lady was, on the score of modesty, wrapped up
in so many veils impervious to the eye, as scarce to
escape suffocation; but the most celebrated awalis
of the capital took care to inform the assistants in

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

their, epithalamiums, of the vastness of the charms
and of the splendor of the jewels, which were not
allowed to gratify their sight.</p>

<p>I do not know how, at the nuptial feast, with the
prospect of all these attractions before me, and in the
midst of all the bustle of the dance, all the din of
music, and all the glare of the lights, I insensibly
fell into a reverie, composed of at least as many
gloomy as cheerful thoughts;&mdash;but so it was!</p>

<p>"Here," said my wandering mind, "am I, the
youngest son of a petty drogueman in an island
of the Archipelago; I, at one time fallen so much
beneath the level of my own legitimate pretensions,
as in vain to seek the situation of a menial, become
the master of a host of slaves, the son to a Bey of
Egypt, and the governor of a province:&mdash;in other
words, already occupying a station far beyond
what once my most sanguine dreams durst have
promised me; and yet, regarding that elevation only
as a stepping-stone to a station infinitely more
exalted,&mdash;to that of Bey; nay, who knows,&mdash;of
Schaich-el-belled itself!</p>

<p>"But by what a series of toils, and sacrifices, and
perils I may be doomed to purchase these honours,
who also can tell? Alas! do I not on the very
threshold of a career strewed with as many thorns
as roses, begin by yielding up my person perhaps
to an unseemly female, and my freedom, to a
domestic tyrant? For well I know the condition of

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

marrying a patron's daughter! And what labours,
what snares, what treachery may be the offspring
of this splendid union, may accompany every step
in the road of my advancement, I know not yet.
But the die is cast; and I must wait the issue of
the game!"</p>

<p>A shake, prolonged by the chief of the singing
damsels with the most consummate skill through
every note of the gamut, until it drew forth a
thunder of applause or taibs which lasted full five
minutes, roused me from my unseasonable meditations,
and brought back my mind to where sat my
body. A pretty Alm&eacute;,<sup id="r202"><a href="#n202">202</a></sup> presenting her tamboureen
for my liberality, completed the reconveyance of my
thoughts into the proper channel. I now became
impatient for the moment that was to disclose to my
sight the partner of my future life, and in this
disposition obeyed with eagerness the damsel who,
delivering me from these tiresome amusements,
summoned me away from the noisy hall of mirth
to the silent sanctuary of Hymen. With awe and
anxiety I passed its threshold, and was ushered
into the presence of her, on whose qualities of
person and of mind must depend so great a portion
of my future fate. The mysterious veil which till
then had concealed her&mdash;face, form and all&mdash;from
my inquisitive eye, fell at my feet; and I saw . . .</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;wonders perhaps the curious reader.
"An angel of light, sent from the highest heavens,

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

on purpose to make my earthly dwelling a paradise?"</p>

<p>Oh no! that would have been too unreasonable
an addition to my good fortune.</p>

<p>"An ugly little monster, then; sufficient, were
this earth a heaven, to convert it into a hell?&mdash;A
being calculated to stamp on each endearment all
the merit of martyrdom?"</p>

<p>Alas! is it then decreed that the human mind
must always, from one extreme, run straight into
the other? like the ball whose recoil is ever proportioned
to the violence which projects it! And
are there not a sufficient number of individuals in
the world neither handsome nor ugly?</p>

<p>Of my spouse at least I do not know what else
could have been said, with due adherence to truth.
Her face was neither of a description to excite, in
defiance of reason, a very extravagant passion;
nor yet of a species to damp, in despite of duty,
a more legitimate ardour. Like other plants kept
carefully secluded from the beneficial aspect of the
sun, this prisoner of the harem certainly had a
sickly pallid hue. Bounded by its sable locks, her
wan colourless face might aptly be compared to the
moon, surrounded by dark conglomerate clouds:
but then again from the midst of this unvaried
hue, her large languishing black eyes shot forth
glances like lightning in a lurid sky; and, as virtue
is its own reward, the assurances of unbounded devotion

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

which my situation called for, tarried not to
diffuse over Khadidg&eacute;'s countenance some of that
animation which alone seemed wanting to class her,
if not with the Helenas, and the Cleopatras of two
thousand years ago, at least with the prettiest of the
mongrel race, which at present grace the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>But ere, from the hour when I first beheld my
spouse, the sun had completed a single one of its
daily revolutions, not a doubt remained on my mind,
that I had obtained, instead of a mistress, a master.
I had only changed my allegiance from the father
to the daughter, and from a lord's dependent,
was become a lady's slave. Nor was even the
general rule, applicable to whatever Mamluke married
his patron's offspring, modified by the peculiar
disposition of the lady Khadidg&eacute;. Quite the reverse!
Within a most delicate frame the young lady concealed
a most unbending mind. The least breath
of air seemed capable of annihilating her person,
but no breath of man had any power to influence
her will. Already in the first coyness of the bride
there lurked more of pride than of timidity; and
in the subsequent altered conduct of the wife there
shone forth an exaction of dues, rather than a surrender
of affections. Jealousy indeed Khadidg&eacute;
felt, and in all its force; but it was of that contracted
sort which fears the loss of a tangible property,
rather than that of a mental tenure;&mdash;of

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

that sort which in a man rests at ease, when he has
locked up his wife. As Khadidg&eacute; could not, consistent
with custom, in the same way lock up her
husband, she took care not only to let me have no
female retinue of my own, but to keep concealed
from my view all the nymphs of her own suite,
who might divert my feelings from their legitimate
current. The instant my footsteps were heard near
the gynec&aelig;um, all its inmates short of sixty used to
hide themselves, or fly, leaving me with my lady
in awful t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. In one instance indeed the
anxiety of the attendants to obey their instructions
defeated its own purpose. A young and pretty
slave, unable to get away in time, took the desperate
resolution of creeping under a clothes-basket
in the very middle of the room through which I had
to pass. In the dark I fell headlong over the awkwardly
placed utensil, and in my rage grasped with
such violence the bundle which had caused my
downfall, that, ere I recognised its nature, my ever
watchful spouse found her fair slave in my arms.
I vain I pleaded ignorance of what I thus had
grasped. The pretty Zuleika&mdash;never more beheld&mdash;seemed
to have dissolved in air.</p>

<p>"And Anastasius the impatient of control," here
exclaims no doubt my reader, "submitted tamely
to such egregious tyranny!"</p>

<p>Alas! already had the climate of Egypt begun to
exert over my energies its enervating influence;

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

already had I imbibed all the languor with which
its humid exhalations by degrees affect foreigners:
already was I, in point of listlessness and apathy, a
perfect match for my indolent helpmate. While she
lay all day long motionless on her sofa at one end
of the house, I lay all day long, equally motionless,
in my recess at the other end; and if she could
scarce accomplish the labour of clapping her hands<sup id="r203"><a href="#n203">203</a></sup>
for a slave, to hold a rose or jessamine up to her
nose, I could hardly go through the exertion of
calling an attendant to sprinkle some fragrant essence
over my beard. Hour after hour I used to sit,
inaccessible to visitors, in a sort of trellised bird-cage
suspended over the kalish, puffing clouds of
perfume through a pipe cooled in rose water, and
deeming an anteree thin as a cobweb too heavy
clothing for my delicate person.</p>

<p>I felt the more anxious to enjoy the moments of
repose still within my reach, as I considered the
days of toil to be at hand. The rumour of Isma&iuml;l and
Hassan's impending descent acquired new strength
every day; and the preparations of Mourad for
a southward march every day became more active.
But the whole was a bubble, and it burst at last.
Misunderstandings arose between the exiles in the
Sa&iuml;d, and the Arab Schaichs on whose alliance they
depended. The quarrel rose at last to such a height
that the Bedoween troops, already with the Beys,
again retired into the desert. The expedition to

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

Cairo therefore was given up; and with the plot
fell the counter plot. On all sides affairs seemed
to assume, for a season at least, an aspect more calm
and serene.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had secured my kiasheflik as well
as my spouse; and finding that for some time to
come no personal service would be required, I felt
it incumbent upon me to act like other governors,
who annually visit their provinces, and spend a few
weeks in the agreeable occupation of inspecting the
morals and regulating the expenditure of their
subjects. For the purpose of appearing in my government
with proper &eacute;clat, I mortgaged one year's
income of my estate, took an affectionate leave of
my patron, sighed with my wife over the duties of
my station, and set out to riot in the luxury of receiving
presents, and imposing avaniahs.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

<div class="center" id="v2ch04">

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to custom, I journeyed slowly. The
tent from which I set out in the morning was, by my
more diligent attendants, pitched before my arrival,
where I had settled to stop in the evening. Frequently,
during my march, I assumed some disguise.
Sometimes it was that of a travelling Syrian, sometimes
of a Barbaresque, and sometimes of an Arab,
enveloped in his abbah.<sup id="r204"><a href="#n204">204</a></sup> Thus fearless of observation,
and aloof from my suite, I amused myself in
prowling about the country, and peeping into the
peasants' hovels. My servants, indeed, discouraged
this mode of travelling: they never ceased to express
their uneasiness at their lord's thus exposing
his precious person; but the more good reasons
they gave for my staying with my retinue, the further
I extended my rambles. I wanted to see all
that passed; and if the master's eye be the best, the
master's garb I knew to be the worst for making
discoveries. My trouble seldom went unrewarded.
In one place the village Schaichs, mistaking me
for the kiashef's caterer, offered bribes of fattened
fowls, to make me swear by the Prophet to an
absolute famine. In another the town folks, investing

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

me with the office of the great man's steward,
promised me ten paras in the piastre on whatever
sums I disbursed for his account; and in a third,
where I passed for an entire stranger to the travelling
officer, they proposed a joint concern in plundering
his equipage. Here an Arab, who was
abusing a fellah for preferring the service of the
mamluke to the freedom of the desert, appealed to
me as to a brother Arab for the justice of his reproach;
and there a peasant, who was describing to
a townsman the rapacity of the kiashef's people, referred
to me as to a fellow peasant, for the truth of
his assertion.</p>

<p>One day in my solitary rambles I met on its way
to the river, a family of villagers consisting of three
generations and upwards; for, besides grandfather,
father and sons, several of the daughters seemed
burthened with more than the babes which they
bore on their backs. An ihram in rags, an old mat
torn to pieces, and an assortment of pitchers worthy
of an antiquarian's collection, were the travelling
relics of the deserted home. A few head of consumptive
cattle formed the van of the procession,
and a plough all in pieces closed its rear.</p>

<p>"Whence come you, good people?" cried I; addressing
the patriarch of the family.&mdash;"From the
Feyoom," was his answer.</p>

<p>"And you leave the native soil to seek the bread
of strangers?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

<p>"Soon I shall be called away, and my son will
not be able to redeem his inheritance. Must he
wait to be driven from the land his father tilled?"</p>

<p>"Whence arises your distress?"</p>

<p>"From God and man, in conjunction. Every
year the waters of the Nile make less way in our
kalish; and every year the sands of the desert creep
further over our fields. Egypt's soil, instead of
crops, will soon only bear corpses! Can we then fly
too soon?"</p>

<p>"And let those that stay behind bear the burthen
of the absent?"</p>

<p>"Those we leave to-day would have left us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Who is your lord?"</p>

<p>"Even that we scarce can tell. One day it is
the Sultan, in whose name we are taxed; another,
the Beys who are employed to tax us, or the delegates
of those Beys throughout all their numberless
subdivisions and stages; another, the Multezim
or owner who accounts with the Beys; another, the
Arab Schaich who rents the land of the owner.
All call themselves our masters, while we can pay
them tribute; all deny their being so, when we
want their protection!"</p>

<p>My retinue now came in sight,&mdash;"Hark ye,"
added I therefore in haste, "servants should not
betray servants; but here come the masters. Take

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

this therefore, and go;" and hereupon I gave the
party to the amount of a piastre; begging they
might not huzza, lest the lord should hear the
noise.</p>

<p>Scarce had I, at the ensuing halting-place, sat
down to my welcome supper, when in burst a fellah,
dragging by the sleeve another of the same class.
"This rogue," said the first, "is the man who last
year stole your lordship's mare." Of course the
heavy charge was most solemnly denied; but not
minding what I considered as a thing of course;
"Scoundrel," said I to the accused, "had you
been content at least with only taking my black
mare:&mdash;but to rob me of my white one!" "The
white one!" exclaimed the man&mdash;"As Allah is my
witness, I never once came near her." "No more
you did;" was my reply, "for there she stands: but
the black one you stole, I find; and for her you
shall swing."</p>

<p>I was still exulting in my ingenuity, when, passing
by a Latin hospice on the outskirts of the
town, my ear was assailed by most piteous groans;
and looking through a latticed window, I discerned
their cause in the shape of a flagellation, which a
lusty friar was inflicting with his knotty girdle, not
on his own sturdy back, but on the much less able
shoulders of a little yellow Coobd, whom he forcibly
held down on the ground, before him. Doubting

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

the efficacy of this mode of instilling a doctrine, I
interposed, and inquired of the missionary the reason
of this paternal correction.</p>

<p>"While we distributed rice," replied the friar,
"this fellow chose to become a catholic; now that
supplies grow scarce, and that we hardly have
enough for ourselves, he brings me back his chaplet,
and has the face to cry, 'no pilaff, no pope!' "</p>

<p>The conduct of the little Coobd I certainly could
not approve; but it reminded me of my own toward
padre Ambrogio. I conceived a fellow-feeling
for the defenceless sufferer, and released him from
the clutches of his ghostly corrector. Thus I amused
myself with acting the knight-errant; and, in my
own mind, became another Antar.</p>

<p>Knight-errantry, however, was entirely set aside
as soon as I reached the pale of my own jurisdiction:&mdash;though
perhaps it might there have been
exerted to the best purpose. Nothing could give me
a more indifferent opinion of the condition of my
vassals, than the first hovel within my domain which
I entered. In the mud of the door-way lay weltering&mdash;affected
in various degrees with the rheum
that was to end in total blindness&mdash;five or six
bloated brats, quite naked, and fighting for a bit of
mouldy millet cake, of the size of my little finger.
Further on in the cabin sat, over a heap of buffalo's
dung, and quite enveloped in its offensive smoke,
a female spectre, mother of these gaunt abortions,

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

who, on seeing a stranger, tore off the only rag
which protected her body, to use it as a cover to
her face; and at the most distant extremity of the
hovel stood the head of the dismal family, burying
the single bag of rice left for its support, in the
earth that formed the floor. One more spade-full,
thrown over the store, would have completed its
concealment, when I made my appearance. At the
awful sight of a mamluke the spade dropped out of
the peasant's hands, and the rag he called his turban
rose a full inch from his head.</p>

<p>"Be composed, my friend," cried I; "it is
not the enemy that is coming, it is your own governor."</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied the man, "will not the kiashef
devour my rice,&mdash;and can the Bedoween do more?
But since you have seen the heap, take half, and
mention not the other, or we must all perish!"</p>

<p>"Come," rejoined I, "for once keep the whole;
but when my writer calls for my tribute, remember
I know your hiding-place, and think not your honour
engaged in letting yourself be cut in stripes,
ere you pay the rent you owe."</p>

<p>At the words I departed; leaving the fellah
motionless with astonishment at having seen his
kiashef, without paying for the sight.</p>

<p>"And this, then," thought I, "is the land which
its infatuated natives think the finest on the surface
of earth; where they would rather die of

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

want, than live in plenty elsewhere. That it has a
hidden charm, I needs must believe, since all obey
its attraction; but where the spell lies I cannot
yet discover. I am now in the very heart of that
Feyoom so famous for its roses, and all that yet
has struck my senses is the smell of its cow-dung!"</p>

<p>Arrived at the place of my residence, I immediately
set about receiving with all proper dignity
the homage and the presents of my subjects.
My writer took special care that none of my vassals
should have to complain of my forgetfulness. To
each he sent a summons to welcome their lord; and
his invitations were addressed not only to the stationary
tillers of the soil, but also to the Arab
Schaichs, who occasionally here and there rented a
district. The liberality of these latter on this occasion
exhibited various shades of difference. The
first of my Bedawee<sup id="r205"><a href="#n205">205</a></sup> tenants who attended my
summons gave me, over and above the tribute due,
two camels, a dromedary, and fifty fat sheep, with
fleeces white as snow. "This begins well," thought
I. The second produced for my acceptance a present
of a different hue;&mdash;two jolly Abyssinian
damsels as black as jet: observing "that even
ivory looked insipid, unless contrasted with ebony."&mdash;The
third only presented his landlord with a
lean steed; but then the very four-footed animal
was of noble blood, and its pedigree so long, that
it would have reached to Cairo. "Even this

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

is not much amiss," said I to myself. A fourth
Arab chief now made his appearance, who gave me
not a single para beyond the stipulated rent; and
to him I only grew somewhat reconciled, when there
came a fifth, who raised such a commotion, that I
would willingly have remitted all he owed me, and
have added a handsome consideration into the bargain,
to see a hundred leagues of imperviable desert
separate our respective jurisdictions.</p>

<p>I had left the lady Khadidg&eacute;, my wife, fully occupied
in collecting every species of amulet and
charm, and recommending herself to the efficacy of
every form of devout orison and practice in vogue
either among Moslemen or Christians, for the purpose
of getting rid, on my return, of the perverse
slimness of her waist: but, excepting the doubts I
might entertain as to the result of these pious endeavours,
I felt with regard to my faithful spouse
in the most happy security, when, unexpectedly, an
express arrived from Cairo, with the sad tidings
that she had not only been seized with a sudden illness,
but was actually considered as in imminent
danger. As however the sapient Moslem &AElig;sculapius,
called in on the occasion, had decided upon the case
without seeing the patient, on the shallow evidence
of a mere bit of silk thread tied round her wrist, I
chose not implicitly to trust to his report, and immediately
set off myself with all speed for the capital;&mdash;resolved
that some Frank physician should, if possible,

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

cure my wife, even at the risk of seeing her;
and only puzzled how to bring about, in the very
teeth of Islamism, so desperate a measure.</p>

<p>Alas! It was written that I myself should behold
my Khadidg&eacute; no more. Just before the last
stage of my journey, the breath of life had forsaken
her youthful frame for ever. My speed only brought
me home in time to hear the dismal howlings that
were raised on her decease. At my first alighting in
the court yard of the house of mourning, a fresh peal
of woolliah-woos, louder than any former, went forth
from every window, by way of an appropriate greeting,
and, without much preparation, gave me the
first notice of my heavy loss. I was next dragged by
force of arms to the place where lay an insensible
corpse, she whom my last parting look had left elate
in all the pride of youth, of health and of power.
Dazzling tissues hung suspended from the bier,
plates of gold encircled the coffin, and flowers of
every hue, filling the air with their fragrance, embowered
the glittering chest, as if to mock or to
render more dismal by the contrast of their gaudiness
the foul corruption already busy within. "O
Khadidg&eacute;," cried I at the appalling sight, "too soon
has thy tale been told: too soon hast thou glided by
like a noon-day shadow; too soon has the rough
wind of death swept away the just expanding blossom
of thy existence!" and was hereupon going to
perform some demonstration of respectful regret:&mdash;but

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

already the attendants had begun to chide me,
that I thus rudely kept the black and blue angels
of the tomb waiting for their new guest. I therefore
let the funeral proceed without further interruption,
lest Azra&iuml;l and his host should render me
accountable for the delay.</p>

<p>My myrtles now faded&mdash;my only remaining shade
now depending on the mournful cypress, I went and
deposited my grief at Suleiman's feet. A good deal
afflicted himself, he yet preserved his wonted placidity
of manner, and assured me that his sentiments
in my behalf would ever remain unchanged. I
thanked him for saying so; but felt that I had lost
the surest pledge to his favour, and was tempted to
apply the Greek saying: "Welcome this misfortune,
so it come but single!"</p>

<p>A mamluke seldom finds much leisure for mourning.
Scarce had I composed myself for the purpose,
when my retirement was invaded by a rumour that
the expedition against the Beys of upper Egypt, a
few months before unexpectedly abandoned, had
been as unexpectedly resumed. It soon was followed
by a strange report that Mourad had actually set
out on his march for Es-souan. This event would
only have afforded us a subject for rejoicing, had
not the signor Mourad&mdash;whether with the view of
reserving for his own adherents all the profits of the
campaign, or in the idea of leaving Ibrahim provided
in his absence with sufficient means of defence&mdash;contented

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

himself with only taking on this occasion
his own troops, instead of collecting all those at Cairo
which belonged to his party; whence the Schaich-el-belled
retained a larger force at his disposal than
was desirable for the success of our plan. Still,
despairing of a more favourable opportunity, we
determined to put the scheme forthwith into execution;
and a meeting of all the principal confederates
was convened at Ayoob's palace, to determine
upon the best mode of proceeding.</p>

<p>When it came to my turn to give my opinion,
I proposed rushing at once with all our host upon
the Schaich-el-belled, surprising him in his palace,
ere any assistance could reach him from the citadel,
and running every hazard in order to secure his
person. No hint whatever was to be given him of
the least dissatisfaction lurking in our breasts; above
all, no proposal of any sort was to be made, nor
any step to be taken that could put the wily chief
in any way upon his guard, ere this purpose was
accomplished. When once fairly in our power,
Ibrahim must submit to whatever terms, and grant
whatever securities we chose to prescribe.</p>

<p>Several of the party, and among others Suleiman
my patron, felt the expediency of this decisive
conduct, and supported my proposal with all their
influence; but Ayoob as strenuously opposed it.
He would not hear of proceeding, as he called it, to
the last extremities with the head of the corps, till

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

less galling measures had been tried; and when I
reproached him with faint-heartedness, he looked
significantly, first at me, then at the further corner
of the room, and at last cried out in an angry tone,
"that at least he never yet had fled from any place
in women's clothes."</p>

<p>Encouraged by the sentiments of this leading personage,
some of the lesser members of our party now
in their turn opposed my scheme with all the resolution
of cowardice; and the boldest measure which
could obtain the assent of the majority was that of
marching out of Cairo, collecting all our forces in
the Koobbet-el-haue, and from our camp sending
Ibrahim the option of compliance with our terms, or
immediate and interminable warfare. On this poor
and spiritless conclusion of the meeting, Suleiman
in his wrath rent his garment, I shrugged up my
shoulders, and the few that had common sense considered
our affairs as lost.</p>

<p>According to the plan resolved upon, as soon
as Mourad was supposed to be sufficiently advanced
on his way to the Sa&iuml;d, we bravely rushed out of
the capital, pitched our camp under the city walls,
and deputed Saleh, the ablest of Ayoob's kiashefs,
to lay before Ibrahim our long list of grievances.
On the first blush of the business, the Schaich-el-belled
appeared more frightened and more disposed
to grant redress, than I durst have hoped. He
seemed ready to accede to any terms; and only

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

wanted&mdash;he assured us&mdash;clearly to understand
what were our wishes. Those who had insisted on
gentle measures now looked all exultation. In the
course of the negotiation, it is true, their confidence
in their sagacity abated a little. The first panic of
the chief seemed gradually to subside: he showed
symptoms of returning resolution; and contrived to
make the affair drag on a long while after the period
fixed for his decisive answer, ere he came to a conclusion.
At length, however, he agreed to our demands;
the treaty was put into writing, and emissaries
went out in every direction to collect such of
the Schaich-el-belled's creatures as were to be our
securities. We only waited for the hostages, triumphantly
to enter the city, and take possession of
the government.</p>

<p>All at once a most appalling report spread through
the camp! While we were quietly drawn up under
one extremity of the city, Mourad, it was said, had
with all his forces re-entered its precincts at the other.
Informed on his march of our insurrection,&mdash;which
perhaps its only object had been to bring to a premature
disclosure,&mdash;he had redescended the left
bank of the river, crossed over at Djizeh, and resumed
his post at Cairo, ere the enormous circuit of
that city had permitted our receiving the least intimation
of his precipitate return; and the very messenger
who was to have brought us the pledges for
the fulfilment of the treaty, brought the first authentic

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

intelligence that all negotiation was at an end!
"Tell my friends outside the gates," were the last
words addressed to this personage by Ibrahim, "that
since they have taken the trouble to quit Cairo of
their own accord, they have nothing to do now but
to make the best of their way to upper Egypt.
Mourad, my colleague, is less enduring than I am."</p>

<p>We looked aghast; but followed the Schaich-el-belled's
advice. Raising our camp without a moment's
delay, we glided in haste behind mount
Mokhadem, and during four days marched without
interruption along the back of the rugged ridge of
which it forms the extremity. Then crossing its
uneven width, we on the fifth morning gained the
river. This too we passed, and soon, on its western
bank, reached the town of Minieh.</p>

<p>Here we fixed our head quarters. Our position
afforded us every convenience for what was next in
our wishes to ruling at Cairo,&mdash;namely, starving the
capital by intercepting its supplies. To contribute
to this laudable purpose as effectually as possible, I
stationed my own little troop in the vicinity of Ash-Moonin,
where I had opportunities of making good
captures, and of manifesting a laudable impartiality.
The times in truth admitted not of nice distinctions
between friends and foes: besides which there lurked
about me&mdash;I know not why&mdash;a presentiment that my
sojourn in Egypt was drawing to a close. I therefore
determined to make the most of my time while

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

I stayed. Summer insects sting sharpest in autumn,
when they begin to grow weak.</p>

<p>Still it was my study that the little offerings of
my friends should appear the sole result of their
own liberality. Receiving intelligence one day that
a rich Coobd of Cairo was to be on the road, I took
special care to greet him on his passage. "I knew
your intention, my worthy friend," said I, "of travelling
this way with all your money and jewels;
and for old friendship's sake immediately scoured
the country, that you might meet with no extortion."
Davood was all thanks. "Set bounds to
your gratitude," resumed I. "The two hundred
sequins you destine me for my trouble I positively
will not take. All I can consent to is to accept a
hundred." Davood began to remonstrate. "No
words," cried I, "but the sequins; for the robbers
still are near!" So thought Davood, and paid the
money.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunger</span>, they say, drives the wolf out of the
forest: it certainly in the year eighty-four drove
the Schaich-el-belled out of Cairo&mdash;but with a full
determination to clear the banks of the Nile, of
which we entirely impeded the navigation. Some
surprise indeed was created by thus seeing the two
leaders exchange offices and characters: for while
Ibrahim sallied forth in warlike trim to attack the
enemy, Mourad remained in the capital a tranquil
spectator of the fray. The conclusion, however,
showed that for once Mourad had foiled Ibrahim
with his own weapons. During the march of the
Schaich-el-belled, his colleague negotiated so successfully
with the Sultan's Pasha, that he induced
the Visier to invest two of his mamlukes&mdash;Osman
kiashef surnamed Tamboordji, and Mohammed
kiashef called the Elfi&mdash;with the rank of Beys.</p>

<p>This proceeding of Mourad's appeared so suspicious
to Ibrahim, that he began to fear lest his
colleague might be meditating the same game which
he himself had played before; and having drawn
him out of Cairo, might shut its gates against his

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

re-entrance, as he had shut them against ours. He
therefore changed his plan, or at least seemed to
do so; and made this occurrence the pretext for
sparing us the battle which he probably never had
intended to give. Instead of waging savage war,
he proposed terms of peace. Our leaders judged
it prudent to meet his advances; and in October
of the same year Ibrahim reinstated our whole party
in Cairo.</p>

<p>Mourad now in his turn sullenly marched out:
but we at first heeded not much his pettishness;&mdash;it
being far from a rare occurrence for the rulers
of Egypt to agree most amicably upon a rupture.
The apparently impending hostilities afford each
party a pretence for imposing on its adherents and
clients extraordinary contributions; and when the
last para for the warlike preparations is paid, lo
and behold! the world is gladdened with the news
of a reconciliation.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, Mourad protracted the
show of warfare somewhat longer than usual; and
indeed acted his part with such truth of imitation,
as almost to impress us with the idea of the reality:
for not only he actually retired into the Sa&iuml;d, but
there continued with such earnestness the task
which we had undertaken of destroying the supplies
of the capital in their very sources, that Ibrahim
at last began to think the joke too serious, and, in
order to appease his rival, again sent us fresh notice

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

to quit the capital. It was unpleasant to be thus
bandied to and fro; but at this juncture braving
Ibrahim would have been braving the whole force
in the citadel, ready to move at his command.
Thus deprived of every hope of successful resistance,
we agreed to obey; but only with the view
of executing a scheme proposed many times and as
often rejected, of coalescing in the Sa&iuml;d with Isma&iuml;l
and Hassan.</p>

<p>I was at my own home when the resolution of
our Beys to quit Cairo reached me. Immediately
on receiving it I collected all that was most valuable
in my harem, and, while the beasts of burthen were
loading, walked over the various apartments of my
abode, as one who bestows a last look on friends he
leaves for ever. "Happen what may," exclaimed
I, "here I have at least enjoyed a few moments of
ease and quiet, the existence of which fate has no
power to expunge from the records of time! Should,
while I live, no other hours of repose fall to my lot,
my mind will revert to these with a grateful recollection!"
All now being ready, I joined my patron,
and with the rest of our party marched out of the
city.</p>

<p>In the full confidence that Ibrahim must make
the peace offering required of him, Mourad had redescended
from the Sa&iuml;d along the eastern banks of
the Nile, and had returned to the vicinity of Cairo.
From the heights of the Mokhadem he saw our

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

troop wind along the plain. He had the vantage
ground, and thought the moment propitious for
exterminating our hostile body at a blow.</p>

<p>To rush down the hill with all his force, and
spring upon us like a lion on an unsuspecting prey,
was the work of an instant. Fortunately his superior
numbers were exhausted by a long march, while
our fewer men were all fresh. We therefore received
the first shock of his onset without giving way, and
a bloody combat immediately ensued.</p>

<p>As usual, the mamlukes of each different house at
first remained in close order round their chiefs; and
I therefore fought next my patron, till, wounded
in the shoulder, he was carried to the rear; when I
acquired greater latitude of movements. Spying
in the thickest of the fight a son of Osman&mdash;my
oldest, bitterest enemy&mdash;I took aim at him while
firing his carbine, and lodged a ball in his side,
which made him bite the dust. One of Elfi's hare-brained
children instantly sprung forward to revenge
Mahmood's death, and made a thrust at his slayer.
Him also a stroke of my yatagan sent reeling out
of the field. He scarce had gone fifty yards, ere he
fainted and fell. Another myrmidon of Mourad's
now advanced: Assad was his name. Proud of his
size and strength, he used to boast of victory before
he fought; and in order to give greater splendour
to his triumph, prefaced his assault with the most
insulting language. The clash of swords soon followed;

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

and here again proved mine the better
blade. My adversary's sabre was shivered in his
hand, and his huge person unhorsed. Maddened
by his previous taunts, I was going to despatch him
as he lay in the dust; but he begged mercy so
meanly, that for very contempt I forbore to take his
life. Scarce had I turned my head to call to my
people, when the miscreant fired at me with deliberate
aim! The ball grazed my cheek. I now dismounted
to pierce the scoundrel's heart; but in the very act
of lifting my poniard, a bullet struck my hand, and
paralysed my fingers. I dropped my handjar; and
Assad&mdash;tearing himself away&mdash;darted afresh amid
the combatants, and soon slunk out of sight.</p>

<p>Grievously disappointed, I vaulted back into my
saddle, but, from the uselessness of my left hand,
was unable either to hold my reins or to wield my
fire-arms. Soon therefore my horse, unsupported
by his rider and sorely wounded, came down.
Thrown off and lamed by the fall, I was obliged
for some time to ward off a hostile mamluke with
one knee to the ground. While in this posture my
yatagan feebly parried his repeated blows, another
of his party spurred on his courser to trample me
to death. The more generous steed refused to
obey his rider, and my own horse, exhausted with
loss of blood, falling dead by my side, now served
me as a rampart. Yet still must I in my helpless
state soon have been despatched, but for one of my

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

own mamlukes, who dashed through the adverse
current, and came to my assistance. Shot by him
in the loins, my adversary was pulled off his horse,
and I mounted in his stead. I could however only
hold my reins with my teeth, and guide my new
courser with my sword, while, raging with the thirst
of vengeance, I flew from rank to rank, to seek the
traitor Assad.</p>

<p>Already had impending darkness begun to baffle
every act of personal animosity, and only to permit
random blows and general slaughter. My search
therefore was fruitless. Ere yet, however, the
closing night had wholly dropped its sable curtain,
a colossal form, soaring like the spirit of evil, caught
my searching eye. Instantly I threw myself down,
stooped close to the ground, penetrated through the
surrounding phalanx, and, while the haughty chief
was giving a signal, struck at his face one single
furious blow. A second must, from the unavoidable
retort of all around him, have wrought my own
death. Quick as lightning, therefore, I made my
escape: while a long protracted shout of terror announced
to all his men that Mourad was wounded.&mdash;His
hated blood, drawn by me, formed the last
event of the expiring battle.</p>

<p>Our principal apprehension had been all along
lest Ibrahim, apprised of the engagement, should
sally forth and support his colleague with the troops
from the citadel. Probably he wished not to render

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

his rival's success loo complete; and Mourad himself,
now having had enough of fighting, no longer
opposed our retreat. He entered the city, while
we, gathering up our most distinguished dead, to
be consigned to earth wherever the safety of the
living permitted, continued our march uninterruptedly
all night. Suleiman, who suffered much
from his wound, was carried in a litter, and I,
with my hand in a sling and my leg bandaged up,
figured on a jaded hack. I regretted the richly caparisoned
steed of my enemy Assad, which I for one
moment had regarded as mine; I still more grievously
regretted the home-thrust of my dagger,
which I hoped to have made his: but my successful
aim at Mourad himself, the ugly gash imprinted
on his rugged jaw, and the streams of blood gushing
from his hateful face, though sights which I had
not had leisure to enjoy in the reality, were a rich
treat for my imagination!</p>

<p>Several years had elapsed between the first combat
I witnessed, and this last engagement. In both
I was allowed to have shown some valour: but how
different were the sentiments which, on these different
occasions, nerved my arm and directed my
blow! In the fight against the Arnaoots I only
obeyed a vague desire to gain applause,&mdash;I was
only driven on by the youthful ferment of my
blood. I fought the foe, as I would have hunted
the beast of prey, from mere wantonness:&mdash;no

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

personal rancour envenomed the wounds I dealt at
random. Here, on the contrary, every feeling of
personal interest, animosity, and revenge directed
my aim, and dwelt on my blows. After hewing
down my enemy I greedily watched his fall, and
contemplated my dagger thrust up to the hilt in
his wound: my soul seemed to thirst after his
blood as after a refreshing stream; and, when the
hot spring gushed from Mourad's own swelling
veins, I could have dared death itself to riot in the
crimson tide!</p>

<p>Just at the period when the animosity between
the insurgents and the chiefs of Cairo was at its
height; when both parties had sealed their enmity
with their blood; when all chance of reconciliation
seemed for ever at an end, arose that never-failing
healer of internal feuds, the fear of an external
enemy. A report, bearing the stamp of undoubted
authority, suddenly spread itself through Cairo,
that Hassan was making immense preparations at
Constantinople for reinstating Isma&iuml;l. Immediately
the terrified leaders sent after our fugitive troop
proposals of mutual forgiveness. The bearers, entrusted
with no less credentials than Mourad's own
ring and chaplet, reached us the sixth day of our
march, in the midst of the mountains. The sole
indispensable condition of the reconciliation which
they offered, was a sacrifice of a few of our Beys'
trustiest followers, whose spoil was wanted to feed

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

the rapacity of their own mamlukes. It is true,
the interests of these very adherents had been the
ostensible pretext of the rupture: but they were
readily given up as a peace offering, when deemed
the only obstacle to renewed harmony.</p>

<p>Among the appointments to be ceded was mine.
Suleiman indeed proposed a commutation; but
whether Mourad knew the author of his wound,
or from whatever other cause, he would hear of no
exchange. My father-in-law therefore ended, like
other politicians, by yielding to circumstances. He
declared himself unable alone to resist the importunities
of all the other Beys, and I was summoned
to give up my possessions. Thus were realized the
effects which I apprehended from the loss of my
wife.</p>

<p>My patron had only yielded, he said, to superior
force; I thought it fair to follow his example.
When therefore the storm burst forth, I gathered
together my trustiest followers, and, instead of returning
to Cairo, and expressing my readiness to be
stripped,&mdash;as I was expected in deference to higher
interests to do,&mdash;struck across the country, passed
the river, and reached my kiasheflik. There, intrenched
in the best manner I was able, I bade my
antagonists take into their own hands the trouble of
turning me out.</p>

<p>During a whole month they seemed averse from
the task, until at last I thought myself forgotten:

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

but on the fifth week after my arrival, I received
intelligence that my successor was coming. A force
so very superior to what I could muster accompanied
this personage, that I gave up the kiasheflik for
lost, and only resolved to make the new kiashef
pay a handsome admission fee. Collecting all my
cash, jewels, and other valuables, I loaded with them
half a dozen camels and dromedaries, freed my
slaves, gave away my fixtures, and, followed by my
small troop of faithful mamlukes, posted myself in
ambush a few leagues from the town, in a place
where I knew that the enemy must pass. It was
an elevated plain, advantageously situated for my
purpose. In front rose a hillock covered with ruined
koobbehs,<sup id="r206"><a href="#n206">206</a></sup> cactus hedges and date trees, which
screened us completely, while behind lay an open
country, and a kalish, with a bridge of boats and
boards, which secured our retreat.</p>

<p>After a whole night of tedious expectation, we
heard at the early dawn the tramp of horsemen, and
presently the enemy came in sight. By his loose and
straggling order of march, it appeared evident that
no suspicion was entertained of our design. Soon
the troop approached so near our masked battery,
that every individual of the party might easily be recognised.
Heavens! how my heart bounded when
in the chief&mdash;in him who came to dispossess me&mdash;I
beheld the identical Assad who had sought my life,
as my reward for saving his own. I immediately

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

made a signal to my followers to leave to myself the
soothing task of just revenge; took the best aim I
was able, and fired. A general discharge instantaneously
followed: but I had the inexpressible satisfaction
of seeing Assad fall first, though several of
his troop soon bit the dust around him. The remainder,
unable to guess the force of their invisible
assailants, immediately took flight, and dispersed in
all directions.</p>

<p>Save the place which my men occupied, there was
not a spot in sight where the fugitives could halt
and rally. The rout of those that remained sound,
therefore, enabled me to approach the wounded.
Assad, though weltering in his blood, was still alive:
but already the angel of death flapped his dark
wings over the traitor's brow. Hearing footsteps
advance, he made an effort to raise his head, probably
in hopes of approaching succour: but beholding,
but recognising only me, he felt that no
hopes remained, and gave a groan of despair. Life
was flowing out so fast, that I had only to stand
still&mdash;my arms folded in each other,&mdash;and with a
steadfast eye to watch its departure. One instant
I saw my vanquished foe, agitated by a convulsive
tremor, open his eyes and dart at me a glance of
impotent rage: but soon he averted them again,
then gnashed his teeth, clenched his fist, and expired.</p>

<p>Wishing for nothing more now that I could obtain,

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

I only sought the speediest retreat, fell back
in all haste, and got to the westward of the beaten
track, into the boundless desert. Several of my
camels were intercepted by the Arabs, and my men
suffered much from missing a well: but falling in
soon after with the Nubian caravan, our distress
was relieved, though at the expense of half my remaining
treasure. At last, after performing a prodigious
circuit, during which we experienced incredible
hardships, we contrived to reach Es-souan,
and joined the exiled Beys, Isma&iuml;l and Hassan.</p>

<p>Never had the insurgents, even when acting in
most open hostility to the chiefs of Cairo, formed
a common cause with the party in the Sa&iuml;d. Too
deeply rooted a jealousy divided the houses of Mohammed
and of Aly. The first and only attempt
at an union of interests was that which followed the
battle of the Mokhadem, and was foiled by the
reconciliation of which I became the victim. At
enmity now with every party in the capital, I was
well received by the Beys of Upper Egypt. I
confirmed to them the welcome intelligence of the
Capitan-Pasha's preparations, and engaged soon to
return with Isma&iuml;l to Cairo. Meantime, apprehending
that I might, in spite of appearances, be
deemed a spy only upon the ex-Schaich-el-belled, I
made over to him my few remaining mamlukes,
and, rid of this burthen, determined to withdraw

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

from Egypt, until the Grand Admiral should actually
be on his way. Having however still some goods
and valuables, I kept my design a secret, lest my
kind friends should make my property a keepsake.
After a few short rambles, to wean them by degrees
from the pleasure of seeing me, I at last undertook a
longer flight. On a fine starlight night, of which
there is no lack near the Cataracts, accompanied
only by two trusty servants mounted like myself on
dromedaries, we slipped away, and again plunged
in the desert.</p>

<p>By a forced march I reached Gieneh. Its kiashef
had been formerly my friend, and what deserves to
be recorded, still showed himself my well-wisher.
He gave me letters for his lieutenant at A&iuml;dab. I
travelled across the sands to this seaport, by the
Franks called Cosseir; and found its road full of
za&iuml;ms<sup id="r207"><a href="#n207">207</a></sup> from Djedda, freighted for Suez, but which
had lost the season. One of them I engaged to
carry me across the Red Sea; and bidding Egypt's
plagues as well as blessings&mdash;its mud and misery,
as well as its perfumed rice and purple dates, its
golden grapes and azure nileh<sup id="r208"><a href="#n208">208</a></sup>&mdash;a long and reluctant
adieu, with heavy heart embarked.</p>

<p>The vessel was wretched, and the passage stormy;
but after expecting to founder on every coral reef
in our way, we at last providentially ran safe into
Djedda harbour. On pressing the Arab shore, after

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

perils so vast and various, I could not help exclaiming:
"My native land has renounced me: the
country of my adoption has cast me of: be thou,
O strange soil, the wanderer's less fickle friend!"</p>

<p>I had left a storm gathering in Egypt, of which
I since have thanked God I witnessed not the
bursting. Already previous to my departure, the
consequence of the scarcity had begun to appear
partially in many places: but it was only after I
left the country that the famine attained its full
force; and such was, in spite of every expedient of
human wisdom or appeal to Divine mercy, the progressive
fury of the dreadful scourge, that at last the
schaichs and other regular ministers of worship,&mdash;supposing
the Deity to have become deaf to their
entreaties, or incensed at their presumption,&mdash;no
longer ventured themselves to implore offended
Heaven, but henceforth only addressed the Almighty
through the voices of tender infants; in
hopes that, though pleased with the sufferings of
corrupt man. Providence might still pity the pangs
of untainted childhood, and grant to the innocent
prayers of babes, what it denied to the agonising
cry of their expiring parents. Led by the Imams
to the tops of the highest minarets, little creatures
from five to ten years of age there raised to heaven
their pure hands and timid looks; and, while all
the countless myriads of Cairo, collected round the

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

foot of these lofty structures, observed a profound
and mournful silence, the feeble voice of spotless
infancy was alone heard to lisp from their summits
entreaties for Divine mercy. Nor did even these
feeble supplicants continue to implore a fertility,
which no longer could save the thousands of starving
wretches, already in the fangs of death. They only
begged that a general pestilence might speedily deliver
them from their lingering and painful agony:
and when, from the gilded spires, throughout every
district of the immense Masr, thousands of infantine
voices went forth at the same instant to implore the
same sad boon, the whole vast population below, in
hoarse and half extinguished sounds, jointly answered,
"so be it!"</p>

<p>So humble a petition was not offered up in vain:
the plague followed the scarcity, and the contagion
completed what the famine had begun. The human
form was swept away from the surface of the
land, like the shadows of darkness which the dawn
puts to flight. Towns, and villages, and hamlets
innumerable were bereft of their tenants to a man.
The living became too few to bury the dead. Their
own houses remained their cemeteries. Where long
strings of coffins at first had issued forth, not a solitary
funeral any longer appeared. Hundreds of
families, who had fled from famine to Syria, were
overtaken by the plague in the midst of their journey,

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

and with their dead bodies marked their route
through the desert. Egypt, smitten by the twofold
visitation, almost ceased to appear inhabited; and
both plagues at last disappeared, for want of further
victims to slay.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> near the Holy City, and had all my time at
my disposal. Could it be better employed than in
seizing so favourable an opportunity of acquiring&mdash;without
the trouble of a journey on purpose&mdash;the
title and the prerogatives of a hadjee?<sup id="r209"><a href="#n209">209</a></sup> I therefore
determined to perform, in its utmost strictness,
the pilgrimage imposed on all true believers; and
no sooner had set foot on the shore of Djedda, than
I immediately proceeded onwards, and soon arrived
at Mekkah, where I achieved in solitude my first
round of devotions at the Kaaba.<sup id="r210"><a href="#n210">210</a></sup> It is true that,
as on this globe at least the holiest places are not
always the most agreeable, I tarried not in this
epitome of paradise beyond the time prescribed by
the law, but hied with equal expedition back to Djedda.
This, however, was only to wait in that seaport
until the Coorban bayram<sup id="r211"><a href="#n211">211</a></sup> should bring together at
Mekkah the whole body of hadjees, when I purposed
to revisit the corner-stone of Islamism, and
to perform under its shadow rites more solemn
and more public.</p>

<p>Even in the busier seaport of Djedda itself, it must
be owned, my pursuits scarce soared above the
amusements of a paltry coffee-house, where I went

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

every morning to smoke my pipe, drink my cup of
kishr,<sup id="r21"><a href="#n212">212</a></sup> and play my game of chess with a famous
hand from Surat; always hoping&mdash;but in vain!&mdash;to
retaliate my adversary's infallible checkmate. These
harmless pastimes were varied, alternately by a turn
on the quay, to see the unlading of goods and monsters
from the Red Sea, and by the tales of a poor
Schaich of the neighbourhood, who possessed the
true art of breaking off his story in the midst of the
most interesting occurrence, leaving his audience all
agape till he resumed his narrative, and never dismissing
his hero, or winding up his plot.</p>

<p>An accidental rencontre with an inhabitant of
Djedda, Sidi Malek, for whom I had recovered at
Cairo some property purloined by Hassan's people
on their visit to his city, promised me a little change
of pastime. Our first meeting was in the bazar.
"I knew," exclaimed Malek on seeing me, "that
this would be a day of rejoicing! The word 'Allah,'
heard the first thing in the morning, never fails
to bring good fortune. I shall not, however, think
mine complete until you leave your okkal, and take
up your abode under my roof." So easy a mode
of making my friend happy my conscience suffered
me not to decline. I collected my chattels, and
followed Malek to his habitation.</p>

<p>My acceptance of the Sidi's hospitalities, however,
soon turned out a greater burthen than I had
suspected. According to Derwish&mdash;the stargazer at

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

Constantinople whom I left meditating how to undermine
the aqueduct&mdash;the most distinguished among
the heavenly bodies alone troubled their pates about
the fate of man: but in the opinion of Malek, every
stone, beast, and plant on the surface of the earth,
presumed most unwarrantably to meddle with our
destiny. Nothing animated or inanimate could be
named, which exerted not over our being a mysterious
influence. From every occurrence, however
trivial, some omen might be extracted, if one only
knew the way; and that way my friend Malek was
determined to find out, cost what it might. Not
that, in the course of his research, he ever dreamt of
looking for such connexions between cause and effect
as must arise from the intrinsic nature of things,
and the palpable relationships between the productions
of this globe. Such a course would have been
derogatory to the dignity of his pursuit. His science
only admitted what was totally out of the course of
nature, and beyond the reach of human understanding.
The occult virtues which Malek sought
in objects, were always precisely those which common
sense would never have guessed at. Every
secret agency was to have in it a something savouring
of a prodigy, which chance alone could disclose.
Accordingly, the less foundation there appeared
for a belief, the more strenuous the advocate it
found in Malek; and while he looked upon men
of real science&mdash;astronomers, physicians, and mathematicians,&mdash;as

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

paltry geniuses who could not
penetrate beyond the surface of things, he considered
soothsayers, jugglers, and conjurers, as the only
men of real and profound talents. To Aristotle
and Galen he would probably have given but an
indifferent reception;&mdash;to the most arrant fortune-teller
his door was open day and night. His house
seemed a sort of asylum for all decayed mountebanks.
One party, out of gratitude for his kindness,
recommended another: and though, where
astrology interfered not, rather a strict Mohammedan,
Sidi Malek immediately made a favourite
of every dirty Jew, Gentile, or Christian, who had
the least pretensions to occult knowledge, "Because
weak man happens to err in one particular, can he
be right in no other?" Malek used to ask; and on
the strength of this truth, he believed every lie,
and trusted every impostor.</p>

<p>While merely theoretical, this system might have
been entertaining enough, but reduced into practice,
it rendered Malek's society very irksome. His own
conversation was incoherent, mysterious, and often
unintelligible; and he took it much amiss when his
friends wished to converse on what they understood.
On the least appearance of incredulity with respect
to his favourite tenets his passion knew no bounds.
Always on the watch for every chance word or
gesture that might be construed into a prognostic
either good or bad, he was constantly floating between

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

idle hopes and silly fears, and conceived the
strangest predilections or the most unfounded antipathies.
My nose unfortunately had a curve which
promised uncommon capabilities for astrology, if
but properly cultivated, and Malek determined that
so happy a disposition should no longer lie fallow,
for want of any pains which he could bestow.</p>

<p>The Sidi's stationary oracle was a soothsayer of
established repute, residing in one of the remotest
suburbs of Djedda, and who seldom condescended
to go from home, but waited to be worshipped in his
own cave or temple. For the sake of peace, I promised
not to neglect the opportunity of being enlightened,
and only bargained to find my own way
to this celebrated personage, the odour of whose
fame, I was told, extended all the world over. It
might be so;&mdash;for it affected me almost to suffocation
on entering his den:&mdash;a sanctuary which, to
say the truth, smelt more of things below than of
the stars above. I groped on nevertheless with
the most undaunted bravery, till I reached the
furthest end of the unsavoury abode.</p>

<p>There the wizard sat in all his state. A stuffed
crocodile canopied his head; a serpent's skin of large
dimensions was spread under his feet, and an old
clothes chest afforded support to the parts between.
Potent charms and powerful spells entirely covered
the wall. They had their names written over them
for the information of the beholder; and hair of

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

unborn Dives,<sup id="r213"><a href="#n213">213</a></sup> heart of maiden vipers, liver of the
bird Roc,<sup id="r214"><a href="#n214">214</a></sup> fat of dromedary's hunch, and bladders
filled with the wind Simoom<sup id="r215"><a href="#n215">215</a></sup> were among the least
rare and curious. Of the wizard's own features so
little was discernible, that I almost doubted whether
he had any. An immense pair of spectacles filled
up the whole space between his cloak and turban.
These spectacles veered incessantly, like a weathercock,
from left to right and from right to left, between
a celestial globe robbed of half its constellations
by the worms, and a Venice almanack despoiled
of half its pages by the wear and tear of fingers. Before
the astrologer lay expanded his table of nativities.</p>

<p>Opposite the master shone&mdash;but only with a
reflected light&mdash;his little apprentice, crouched, like
a marmoset, on a low stool. The round sparkling
face of this youth&mdash;immoveably fixed on the face
of his principal,&mdash;seemed to watch all his gestures;
and never did he stir from his station, except to
hand him his compasses, to turn his globe, or to
pick up his spectacles, which for want of the proper
support from underneath came off every moment.
After each of these evolutions the little imp immediately
ran back to his pedestal, and resumed his
immoveable attitude till the next call for his activity.
So complete a silence was maintained all the time on
both sides, that one would have sworn every motion
of this pantomime must have been preconcerted.</p>

<p>Fearful of disturbing the influence of some planet,

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

or confusing the calculations of some nativity, I
myself remained a while silent and motionless at the
entrance of the sanctuary; but finding that I might
stay there till doomsday, if I waited for an invitation
to advance, I at last grew impatient, marched
up to the wizard, put my mouth to his ear, and
roared out as loud as I could: "I suppose I am
addressing the learned Schaich Aly."</p>

<p>Upon this, the astrologer gave a start, like one
suddenly roused from some profound meditation,
turned his head slowly round, as if moving by
clock-work, and, after first leisurely surveying me
several times from head to foot, and again from foot
to head, at last said in a snuffling but emphatic
tone,&mdash;drawling every word, in order to make what
in itself was not short longer still:&mdash;"If you mean
the celebrated Schaich Abou Salech, Ibn-Mohammed,
Ibn-Aly el Djeddawee el Schafe&iuml;,<sup id="r216"><a href="#n216">216</a></sup> Schaich of
the flowery mosque, and the cream of the astrologers
of the age, who holds familiar converse with
the stars, and to whom the moon herself imparts all
her secrets, I am he!"</p>

<p>"And if you should happen to want the best
beloved of the pupils of this luminary of the world,
the young bud of the science of which he is the
full-blown pride, the nascent dawn of his meridian
splendour," added from his pedestal the worshipful
apprentice&mdash;"I am he!"</p>

<p>"Hail," answered I, "to the full-blown pride of

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

astrology, and hail to its nascent bud! May they
be pleased to inform me what I am, whence I come,
whither I am going, and whether or not I may
hope to recover what I have lately lost?"</p>

<p>"Young man," replied the wizard, "you lump
together a heap of questions, each of which, singly,
would take a twelvemonth to answer at length.
Besides, it is not in my own person that I disclose
such matters. You cannot be ignorant that the
voice of prophecy has ceased with the holy one of
Mekkah. I am but the humble interpreter of the
stars. It is true,"&mdash;added he, lest this exordium
should deter me from giving him my custom&mdash;"that
my vast knowledge of the celestial oracles
which glitter in the firmament, enables me to understand
their language as clearly as my mother
tongue; and that I thence know to a tittle all that
was, and is, and is to be. I may therefore forthwith,
if you please, ascertain from the chance opening
of the holy book, in what way the heavenly
bodies choose&mdash;on this occasion&mdash;to be addressed."</p>

<p>I agreed. The doctor performed his ablutions,
and the dawn of his meridian splendour shook the
dust from off his gown. Thus cleansed, at least
externally, he mumbled a prayer or two, and then
with great solemnity opened the Koran.</p>

<p>"Child," said he, after having inspected the page
displayed before him,&mdash;"the admirable and important
chapter on which Providence has willed the

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

eye of its servant to fall treats of the balance W&eacute;zn.<sup id="r217"><a href="#n217">217</a></sup>
This proves incontestably&mdash;but, ere I proceed further,
what do you mean to pay me?"</p>

<p>"Two piastres," was my answer; thinking this a
liberal remuneration. Not so the wizard: the most
grievous of insults could not have put him into a
greater rage. "Two piastres!" exclaimed he; "why,
in the quietest of times, and when a man's fortune
might almost be told him blindfold, this would
scarce have been an aspre each adventure; and now
that the world is all turned topsy turvy, that men
do not know whether they stand on their heads or
their heels; now that women wage war, kings turn
philosophers, and high priests stroll about the
country; now that the Grand Lama of Tibet takes
a turn to Pekin, and the Pope of Rome travels post
to Vienna&mdash;to offer such a fee! insolent, absurd,
preposterous!"</p>

<p>I let the astrologer's passion cool a little first,
and then resumed the negotiation. After a good
deal of altercation, it ended in Ibn-Mohammed,
Ibn-Aly el Schafe&iuml; undertaking to reveal my destiny
in two days, for the important sum of as many
sequins.</p>

<p>At the appointed time I returned, but found not
Schaich Aly, as before, in solitary meditation. He
stood surrounded by a whole circle of customers;
and was abusing one poor fellow so tremendously
as to terrify all the rest, and make them tremble

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

lest their own fortunes should fare the worse for
the incident. "Wretch!" he cried;&mdash;"to apply
to me for charms to rid your house of vermin; as
if I was in league with vipers and with scorpions!
Go to the wandering santons that ply in the cross
ways, and presume not again to appear in the
presence of one whom the very skies treat with
deference."</p>

<p>The frightened peasant retired, and the remainder
of the party received the devout and wonderful
sentences, which only required being kept carefully
sealed up, to procure the bearer every species of bliss.</p>

<p>The levee thus despatched, the wizard turned to
me. "I have completed your business," cried he,
handing me a dirty scrawl. "But it has been with
incredible toil. I cannot conceive what you have
done to the stars. At the bare mention of your
name they all began to laugh. It has cost me a
whole night's labour to bring them to their senses.
Instead of two sequins, I ought to have two dozen."</p>

<p>"Not one single aspre," replied I, glancing over
the paper, and then throwing it in the wizard's face.
"The beginning informs me that I shall certainly
die young, provided I do not grow old, and cannot
fail to marry, unless I die single; and as to the end,
it has no meaning at all!"</p>

<p>"It has a great deal of meaning," replied the
now infuriated stargazer&mdash;grinning like an afrite;<sup id="r218"><a href="#n218">218</a></sup>
"for it means that you certainly will be hanged."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

<p>"It then also means," replied I, "that I need
not pay a farthing; for, if I am not hanged, you
have written a parcel of lies undeserving of a fee;
and, if I am equally to swing whether I pay or not,
I may as well save my money, and give you a drubbing
to boot." So saying, I laid on; and the young
bud of science, who tried to protect his master, came
in for his share of my bounty. All intercourse
with the constellations now being broken off, I
walked away, alternately threatened with the justice
of the stars, and with that of the cadee.</p>

<p>My behaviour to his pet astrologer made Malek
think somewhat less favourably of my docility, and
our friendship, hereupon, cooled a little. Fortunately
the season of the festivals was at hand, and I returned
to Mekkah, to witness the arrival of the pilgrims.</p>

<p>At Cairo I had viewed the departure of the
caravan from the Birket-el-hadj<sup id="r219"><a href="#n219">219</a></sup> as a species of
public rejoicing. The whole of the night which
preceded the raising of the tents, the camp, resplendent with the light of millions of lamps, and
re-echoing with the sound of thousands of musical
instruments, seemed the special abode of mirth and
pleasure; and the ensuing morning the pilgrims,
fresh, gay, full of ardour, and prancing along the
road, looked like a procession of the elect going to
take possession of Paradise.</p>

<p>Alas, how different was the appearance of this

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

same caravan, after a long and fatiguing march
across the desert, on its arrival at Mekkah! Wan,
pale, worn out with fatigue and thirst, incrusted
with a thick coat of dust and perspiration, the hadjees
who composed it seemed scarce able to crawl
to the place of their destination. The end of their
journey looked like that of their earthly existence;
or rather, one might have fancied their bodies
already smitten by the spirit of the desert, and
their ghosts come disembodied to accomplish their
vow.</p>

<p>Among the arrivals were some of my Egyptian
friends; but their sufferings had so altered them,
that they were obliged to syllable their names, ere I
could bring their persons to my recollection. One
had almost lost his eyesight, another scarce preserved
a remnant of his before slender intellect, and
a third was, in consequence of constant alarms, become
subject to such spasmodic movements, that he
believed himself obliged to hold his head fast by
the ears, lest it should veer on his body like a
weathercock.</p>

<p>The holy house of Mekkah offers nearly the same
difference from that of Loretto, which the Moslim
character does from that of the Franks. Every
body knows the Santa Casa to be a whirligig sort
of thing, which, in its roving disposition, changed
its abode half a dozen times before it could finally
settle. The Kaaba, on the contrary, is a steady

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

demure sort of an edifice, which, from the day the
angels placed it where it stands, never manifested
the least inclination to move. Accordingly, even
Mohammed dared not meddle with its well established
reputation. It stood its ground most
firmly in spite of his reform, and to this day remains
the chief object of the worship of his followers.</p>

<p>Seven times I walked round the holy pile in full
procession, and seven times kissed the black stone,
which the angel Gabriel brought from Paradise
(I did not inquire why) to figure in its south-west
corner, I next went to the valley of Menah to renounce
Satan and his works, by flinging a pebble
over my left shoulder; nor did I fail to fill a
pitcher with the brackish water of the well Zemzem,
to quench the thirst of the soul. But what
I prized beyond all other things were the parings
of the besom that had swept the tabernacle, which
I purchased from the Shereef of Mekkah<sup id="r220"><a href="#n220">220</a></sup> to
cleanse the impurities of the heart, and which, if
mine were not all wiped away in consequence, failed
of doing its duty.</p>

<p>My spiritual concerns thus attended to, I turned
to my temporal affairs, and made an exchange of
some of the property which I brought from Egypt,
for other and more suitable articles; for be it
known that the festivals of the holy house end in a
fair, held in the innumerable tents which surround

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

it like a zone, and bring together merchants and
goods from the most opposite extremities of the old
hemisphere,&mdash;very properly making even the worship
of Mammon lend its support to the temple of
the Lord.</p>

<p>From Mekkah I proceeded with the whole body
of the pilgrims to Medinah, a place somewhat less
holy, though infinitely more agreeable. There (still
intent on deeds of holiness) I bargained for a little
bit of the fringe which had adorned the Prophet's
tomb; but found the unconscionable vender ask a
price which I scarce would have given for Mohammed's
own two front teeth, enshrined in the Sultan's
chapel at Constantinople. Fringeless, therefore, I
went on to Damascus, with the principal division of
the caravan, headed by the celebrated miscreant
Djezzar,<sup id="r221"><a href="#n221">221</a></sup> Pasha of Acre.</p>

<p>No extraordinary events signalised that year the
homeward journey of the hadj:<sup id="r222"><a href="#n222">222</a></sup> for I reckon not
as such the hundreds of camels that died every day
of fatigue on the road, to the great annoyance of
the Schaich of Sardieh who furnished them, and to
the great delight of his loyal subjects, who cut them
up and ate them; and still less do I reckon as such
the thousands of pilgrims that gave up the ghost
from the same cause, to the annoyance, I fear, of no
one but themselves, and to the unspeakable satisfaction
of the conducting Pasha, to whom their property
devolves.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

<p>For my own part, as I observed mortality to be,
somehow, rifest among the richest pilgrims, and
was still possessed myself of some valuable luggage,
I continued during the whole of the journey particularly
careful of my health. I ate no made
dishes, knowing them to be heating; and abstained
from brewed beverage, as apt to attack the bowels:
but preferred the simplest fare, however coarse,
and drank plain water, though ever so muddy.
By means of this regimen I escaped&mdash;thank God!&mdash;all
the bad effects of the journey. A more difficult
task than that of avoiding the consequence of
the climate was, in my opinion, that of eluding the
overpowering attentions of the Bosniac guard<sup id="r223"><a href="#n223">223</a></sup> of
the Emir hadj. These gentlemen were paid for
protecting the property of the pilgrims, and it is but
doing them justice to say that they could scarcely
have acted otherwise than they did, if it had been
their own. A Deli-bash<sup id="r224"><a href="#n224">224</a></sup> of the Pasha's in particular
used to show such solicitude about my
equipage, that not one article of it would have
escaped his vigilance or been suffered to remain
out of his keeping, had I not early in the business
bethought myself of recommending to him, as more
worthy his attention, the luggage of a wealthy
Turkish merchant, which, much heavier than mine,
required more being lightened by an experienced
hand.</p>

<p>The only one of my companions whom I trusted

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

was a Cypriote. Like myself a Greek by birth, he
had like me embraced Islamism from choice: but
with this difference, that love had led the way to my
apostasy, and revenge to that of my new associate.
He had turned Mohammedan for the sole purpose of
being qualified to return to another Mohammedan,
without breach of etiquette, the favour of the bastinado.
No sooner was he admitted into the bosom
of Islamism, than he ran to discharge the debt; and
paid it with such ample interest, that his creditor
was never heard to utter a single syllable of complaint.
To do penance for this petulance as he
pretended,&mdash;or rather, to withdraw from the scene
of this achievement, as I believe, he undertook the
pilgrimage. From Cyprus he embarked for Jaffa,
from Jaffa crossed over to Suez, and at Suez took
shipping with a flotilla of hadjees bound for Djedda.
"Huddled together so thick"&mdash;said he&mdash;"that we
found not room to lie down, in boats so rotten that
we expected to split on every coral reef, I never expected
to reach land again; and do not know whether
I owe my being saved from a watery grave to
Mohammed or to the Virgin; as, for fear of a mistake,
I addressed my prayers to both. This however
I do know most positively, that, having got
once on land again, I mean&mdash;please God!&mdash;never
more to trust myself on the water. I have conceived
such a horror of that element, that Mohammedan,
and, what is more, hadjee as I now am, I

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

can scarce prevail upon myself to drink a drop of
any thing but wine pure unmixed."</p>

<p>My friend Mahmood, however, was destined more
justly to appreciate the comforts of travelling on dry
land, when a three weeks journey across the sands
of Arabia had killed off with fatigue and heat about
a fourth of our caravan. Almost become transparent
with loss of flesh, he now swore he would rather
a thousand times be swallowed up at once by a wave,
than be mummified by inches.</p>

<p>On entering the Pashalik of Damascus, the scene
changed completely. Each league, as we advanced,
now brought some improvement in our condition.
First came to meet us the supply of fresh provisions
from Trabloos; next the convoy from Palestine;
and when, soon after, we entered the fertile plains
of Hauran, I felt as if ushered at once from the
burning bowels of hell into the flowery fields of
Elysium. Indeed, on first beholding from a small
eminence, after a month's wearisome march through
sands almost red hot, the glassy pool of Mardin
encircled by its verdant banks, such was the fit of
hydro&mdash;not phobia&mdash;but mania which came upon
me, that, had I been within reach of the lovely
puddle, I would have plunged into it headlong&mdash;dress,
armour and all!</p>

<p>The privations of a pilgrimage are not necessary
to render Damascus a true paradise. Groves of
orange and plum trees inbosom its walls, limpid

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

fountains sparkle in all its habitations; and so much
did its beauties animate and inanimate, its exquisite
confectionary, and its cool and sparkling sherbets
delight my eye and palate, that I purposed making
it my abode until I should hear further of the High
Admiral's motions. Purified by my pilgrimage, I
thought I could afford to run up a new score of
little peccadilloes; and though in the course of three
weeks I saw the forty thousand hadjees with whom
I had entered Damascus again disappear almost to
a man, I still continued without the smallest intention
of stirring, until I found that I had reckoned
without my host&mdash;I mean without Djezzar, the
eternal Pasha.</p>

<p>One Friday morning, after my devotions, just as
I stepped out of the mosque, my eye happened to
be caught by one of those celestial beings, found in
large cities, who, anticipating the office of the Houris
of Paradise, have no objection to cast a ray of bliss
on the existence of mortal man. Unfortunately my
eagerness to pursue this flitting form of brightness,
made me overlook some nearer but less attractive
objects which stood in my way. Foremost among
these happened to be a little man, who, walking up
the steps of the mosque just as I rushed down, was
so much below my line of sight, directed straight
forward, that I only perceived his proximity by the
violence with which I came in contact with his person,
and occasioned his downfall. I should more

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

properly have said, his fear of a downfall; since I
had the address to catch him in my arms, and to
twirl him round like a top, so as to break the force
of the shock, and only to lay him neatly down on
his seat upon the steps, without having received the
smallest injury.</p>

<p>Great as was my hurry, I felt loth to proceed till
I had looked round to see whom I had thus involuntarily
helped to a seat. I found it to be a personage
dressed indeed after the Turkish fashion, but evidently,
from the very Christianlike manner in which
his Mohammedan apparel was huddled on, a Frank
in disguise. In short, I had run foul of an inquisitive
traveller, who, come to have a sly peep at a
mosque, noted in the empire for the care with which
it is kept sacred from the intrusion of infidels, certainly
expected not his curiosity to meet with so
providential a punishment.</p>

<p>I always piqued myself upon my good breeding,
especially to strangers who might report of me in
Franguestan. For which reason I turned back, and
laying hold of the short person of the traveller in the
readiest way for righting it&mdash;namely, by the ample
folds of his nether man,&mdash;I lifted him up like an oil
jar, and so set him on end again; at the same time
reversing his aspect for the benefit of his curiosity,
and turning his face towards the entrance of the
mosque which he was come to view.</p>

<p>I do not know by what strange bias in his mind,

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

to be pushed down should have appeared to him a
misfortune patiently to be endured, while to be set
on his legs again was taken for an indignity, which
called for every expression of the utmost resentment:&mdash;but
so it was; and, instead of thanks, I got nothing
for my pains but abuse, the more galling since
my courtesy had made me lose sight of the fair object
of my pursuit. It is true that, as strong passion
is inimical to disguise, my traveller had, in his wrath,
resorted to his native tongue&mdash;the German; but I
had heard enough of that language with the Swedish
baron at Pera, to understand every term of commendation
bestowed upon me on this trying occasion.
I therefore ran back, in order to undo what
I had obtained so little gratitude for doing, and
again gently laid the angry traveller down in the
very place from which I had raised him; at the
same time begging his pardon for having presumed
to rectify his position.</p>

<p>There is, or was, at Damascus a Latin hospice,
tolerated by the Pasha, solely, I believe, for the sake
of one of its friars, padre Giacomo, a great favourite
with Djezzar for reasons connected by the Damascenes
with the magic art. This friar had accompanied
our stranger in his rambles through the city,
as <i>cicerone;</i> but had prudently kept aloof while the
bolder traveller made his attempt upon the mosque.
However, witnessing from afar the last act of my
intercourse with his guest, he took it into his thick
skull that I was ill-treating him, and in consequence

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

came up, and began, on the strength of his influence
with the Pasha, to abuse me in his turn;&mdash;not,
however, like his more considerate friend, in an outlandish
language, in which his impertinence might
have passed off for civility, but in very intelligible
Arabic, and to the great edification of all the bystanders.</p>

<p>In the midst of Damascus this was not to be
borne: "See," cried I therefore to the mob, "what
it is to have an old woman for a Sultan, who grants
firmans<sup id="r225"><a href="#n225">225</a></sup> to Christian dogs," (my politeness had
by this time given way a little) "to come and spy,
disguised in our own dress, the nakedness of our
land; in order that their Crals<sup id="r226"><a href="#n226">226</a></sup> may know how to
conquer it.&mdash;But glory be to the Prophet, and down
with the Yaoors!"</p>

<p>"Yes, down with the Yaoors; and let us go and
drown them," answered the ready mob.</p>

<p>This proposal even exceeded my wishes. But I
had once saved a Jew from a watery grave, and I
thought I might have equal success with a brace of
Christians. "No, no," cried I, therefore; "the
Arabs would think that inhospitable. Let us only
disable these infidels from passing themselves off for
Mussulmen, by stripping them of their mustachios
and beard. They will look as ridiculous again
when shaved, as they would do merely drowned."
So thought the mob. My friends consequently were
taken to the nearest barber, seated, lathered, shaved,
and dismissed.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

<p>But the bristles of the Capuchin's beard were
fated to become thorns in my side. The Pasha took
up the affair. He could neither bear to be without
his friend the friar, nor to see him in his presence
with a beardless chin. I very soon got hints of the
unwholesomeness of the Damascus air; and of all the
physicians in the world I wished least for Djezzar to
be my phlebotomist. Having picked up a good number
of the country sword-blades, remarkable for their
fine temper, I resolved to convert my steel into gold
in the capital. There also I should be more in the
way of watching the Grand Admiral's motions; and
I doubted not that an ex-kiashef, hostile to Ibrahim
and Mourad, would easily obtain rank in the Sultan's
army. I therefore packed up my little property, and
the very evening after the warning slept at Salieh.</p>

<p>The next morning I proceeded with a caravan to
Trabloos, and there embarked for Stambool on board
a vessel from Alexandria. The cargo consisted of
black slaves. The richest article was a little negro,
who had been furnished with his passport for the
harem by an old Coobd in the Sa&iuml;d, purveyor to my
patron Suleiman. Though the only one of twenty
who had escaped alive, poor little blackie looked very
unhappy. To console him, I used to prognosticate
his becoming some day Kislar-Aga; when he would
have all the beauties of the Seraglio under his command!
"Alas!" answered he, "of what use will it
be to me?" "Of what use.?" I replied, "why to
whip them, to be sure; and so to vent your spleen!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> number of years had now elapsed
since I left Mavroyeni; and changes more marked
than even those which time effects had since that
period taken place in my circumstances. I was not
only from a boy become a man, but from a Greek
a Mohammedan, and from a person of no note whatever,
an individual who had filled no inconsiderable
character in the world's varied drama. I had acted
a part both in negotiation and in warfare. I no
longer either thought myself an inferior to the drogueman
of the arsenal, or stood in need of his protection.
It was doubtless for the latter reason that,
when arrived at Constantinople, I no longer felt any
hesitation to call at his door. Little acquainted,
however, with the revolutions which might have
happened in a place so fertile in storms as the
Fanar, I thought it prudent, ere I ventured upon
my visit, to collect some information respecting my
old patron; lest, seeking his abode too abruptly,
I should be conducted to a burying-ground or a
dungeon.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

<p>"Friend," answered the old messmate to whom I
addressed my inquiries, "Mavroyeni is no longer
to be found at the Arsenal."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied I&mdash;and motioned with
my hand, as if to say: "he is shortened by the part
above the neck."</p>

<p>"Not yet," resumed my informer, "but in a fair
way of being so. He is at present Hospodar of
Valachia."</p>

<p>"Hospodar of Valachia!" exclaimed I, starting
back at least three paces. "What! Nicolas Mavroyeni,&mdash;a
mere man of the islands, a rank taooshan!
has he then at last been able to insinuate himself
into the fairest of the two Greek provinces; and
that, in the very teeth of every Ipsilandi, Morosi,
Callimacki and Souzzo whom the Fanar could muster
to oppose his intrusion."</p>

<p>"He has;" rejoined Notara. "After having
been, during fifteen years and upwards, regularly
threatened every day at the Terzhaneh by the
Grand Admiral with being kicked out of office, he
has only left the place of drogueman of the fleet, to
step into the very highest situation which a Greek
can attain in the Turkish empire; and that, without
any stipulation for the purchase of the principality,
without any compromise as to the length of his
tenure, without any restriction or engagement as
to the persons he was to promote. Fettered by no
clause or limitation whatsoever, he has distanced all

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

his rivals, and swept away the whole stake single-handed."</p>

<p>I begged my friend to inform me how this
miracle had been accomplished.</p>

<p>"You must remember," replied he, "that Russia
never acted with more hostility towards Turkey
than after the peace. But the Muscovites were
governed by a man in petticoats, and we, ruled by
old women in turbans. Haleel-Hameed Visier, and
after him Shaheen-Aly Visier, seemed determined
to abide every insult of the northern virago. At
last, however, the interview between Joseph and
Catherine opened the Sultan's eyes. Abd-ool-Hameed
felt that his sacrifices would not preserve
peace, and must diminish the chance of a successful
war. He dismissed the pacific Shaheen, and looked
about for a more enterprising and warlike Visier.
The only one in the whole empire that could be found
to suit his views was Youssoof, the water-carrier
of Smyrna, the caleondjee of the fleet, the counsellor
and right hand of the Capitan-Pasha, the
defender of the Boghaz against the Russians, the
Moohasseel of the Morea, and finally, the supreme
Visier of the Othoman empire.</p>

<p>"Youssoof in his turn felt the necessity of confiding
the government of a province so important
and so much exposed as Valachia to none but a
man of resolution and bravery. Such an one was
not to be found among the merchant-princes of the

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

Fanar: but such an one he knew his old comrade
in the service of the Capitan-Pasha, Mavroyeni,
to be. He therefore proposed him. In vain did
all the Fanariotes for once cordially unite to prevent
your old master's nomination. In vain did they put
forward their tool Petracki, the seraff<sup id="r227"><a href="#n227">227</a></sup> of the mint.
This zealous agent might spend more money to
prevent an election to a principality, than ever had
been wasted to obtain one: it availed nothing.
Mavroyeni was invested; and when, in the act of
receiving at the hands of the supreme Visier the
marks of his dignity, he begged as the single favour
which was wanting to complete his bliss, the head
of the seraff, that boon also was granted. On going
out of the audience chamber,&mdash;by way of a delicate
attention&mdash;Petracki's bleeding head was made to roll
at his feet.</p>

<p>"Mavroyeni is now gone in the fulness of his
glory to take possession of his principality. Perhaps,
however, what he regarded as the last testimonial
of his elevation may prove the first step to
his downfall. It is secretly whispered that the late
Sultan Mustapha had confided several millions of
piastres to Petracki for the use of his son Selim,
during the reign of Abd-ool-Hameed his brother.
This deposit is necessarily involved in the general
fate of the seraff's confiscated property. But Selim
some day must come to the throne, and he will not

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

fail to remember the loss he sustained through
Mavroyeni."</p>

<p>On hearing all this, my first impulse was to pay
the patron of my youth a visit in his principality:
but my second thoughts presented my stake in Egypt
as the one most worth following up. However, the
Capitan-Pasha being as yet far from ready for his
expedition, I determined, in the meantime, to indulge
in the supreme pleasure of the Italians&mdash;the
<i>far niente</i>.</p>

<p>At Chios, an intimacy had long subsisted between
my father and another Greek merchant, by name
Mavrocordato. His extraction was honourable:
friends traced his pedigree to a younger branch of the
Imperial Palaeologi: history allowed him the latter,
and more certain honour of being related to several
of the princes of Valachia,&mdash;the first of whom, invested
by the Porte, bore the same name. He was
a man of most respectable character: nay, while
burthened with so numerous a family that the most
rigorous parsimony could only ensure to each of its
members a very moderate provision, he even enjoyed
the reputation of being particularly liberal, and
seemed contented when the expenses of the twelvemonth
did not exceed the comings in of the year.
But&mdash;strange to tell!&mdash;no sooner had he through a
fatal contagion lost all his children save one, in whom
consequently was to centre his whole inheritance,

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

than a total revolution took place in his conduct.
The possibility of leaving this only heir extremely
opulent now for the first time seizing hold of his
imagination, gave it a new bias, and bred a desire
for riches, before unfelt. He who while in moderate
circumstances had been generous to a proverb, now
all at once, when he saw his hoard accumulate,
became saving, retrenched many of the innocent
luxuries in which he formerly indulged, and began
to toil for the acquirement of superfluous wealth
with a devotion often before sharply censured by
himself, while he only possessed a sufficiency. Still,
however, he was never suspected of increasing his
gains by dishonourable means, nor could he be
accused of sordid avarice. He might be said to live
below his income, but he ranked not among those
imbecile misers who, during their lifetime, starve
the very heir whom they destine at their death to
revel in their riches. No expense was spared for
the education of Spiridion; and even for the pleasures
of this beloved son Mavrocordato would often
outstep his own notions of discretion.</p>

<p>The intimacy between Mavrocordato and my
father had produced an habitual intercourse between
Spiridion and myself. It could not be called friendship;
it was scarce even entitled to the appellation
of companionship: for there existed between us a
difference of two years&mdash;a prodigious one at our age,&mdash;and
sufficient to make me look upon the son of

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

Mavrocordato as by no means fit to join in my
youthful sports. Our connexion might be described
as composed of protectorship on my part, and of
deference on that of Spiridion. I led him in my
train, spoke to him in a tone of authority, and gave
myself the airs of his tutor. The fag of the party
when I associated with boys of my own standing, my
proteg&eacute; was only allowed to contribute to my pastimes
when I found myself destitute of other resource.
But, flattered by being admitted in any
form, under my auspices, to the diversions of my
older playmates, Spiridion asked not for more, contemplated
me with sentiments of veneration, felt
honoured by my commands, and executed all my
high behests with a zeal and promptitude savouring
of perfect devotion. To employ in my concerns any
other boy but him was on my part a sign of displeasure,
and to himself a subject of mortification. It
was he who, whenever we went out on a marauding
expedition, was sent forward as a scout to explore
the ground; who, when we stripped an orchard,
kept watch till we had secured the booty; and who,
whatever exploit we engaged in, generally paid the
penalty while we carried off the fruits. But the
sufferings which he earned in our service he ever bore
most manfully, and his firmness in submitting to any
punishment rather than betray our confidence was
truly heroic. In return, I always sustained my part
as his protector, defended him against every other

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

boy, allowed none of my comrades to assume over
him the least authority, and would have made any
one who in my presence had presumed to correct
my little Spirro, long remember the castigation
which would have followed such an offence.</p>

<p>Still, however, spite of the public countenance
with which I honoured Mavrocordato's son, the
father would not have grieved to have seen us less
together. For a time he kept us as much asunder
as his own frequent intercourse with my own sire
would permit: but an event took place, which, in
the midst of all Mavrocordato's attempts to dissolve
it, riveted our friendship more closely than ever.</p>

<p>I had headed a large troop of my companions
in a swimming party, when one of the lesser boys
spying some way off a small boat upon the beach,
set it afloat, dragged Spiridion in after him, and
rowed out to a considerable distance. Suddenly
there arose a violent squall. The truants grew
frightened, they lost their presence of mind, mismanaged
the oars, and overset the boat. Much
fatigued with a good hour's splashing in the water,
I had just finished putting on my clothes, when an
universal shout of terror made me raise my eyes,
and see the two children struggling with the waves!</p>

<p>Spiridion's companion was a tolerable swimmer,
and rapidly approached the beach. No one felt the
least alarm for him: but Spiridion himself, only
supported by the oar to which he clung, seemed on

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

the point of sinking. Already encumbered with my
clothes, I called out to my still naked companions
to jump in and save my charge. "Who dares?"
was the only universal answer.</p>

<p>Dressed as I was, I now resolved to have recourse
only to my own exertions, plunged into the sea, swam
to Spiridion, and succeeded in throwing to him one
end of my sash, while I held the other fast between
my teeth. Supporting the child in this way, I tried
to regain the beach. It was still a good way off
when some of my comrades, seeing me appear faint
and overwhelmed with my load, at last took courage,
and threw themselves into the water to swim to
my assistance. But I had got too far unassisted
to accept of their tardy succour, and resolved to
achieve the task alone, or perish in the attempt.
Collecting all my remaining strength, I pushed
away my officious playmates, and invoking my protecting
Saints, strained every still obedient nerve
for a final exertion. It exceeded my powers:&mdash;held
back by the weight of Spiridion, I felt myself going
down. In this situation, was I, by a perseverance
which could do my friend no good, to share his untimely
end? or, by yielding to the suggestions of
prudence, at least to save my own life?&mdash;Reason, I
suppose, would have said: "Save yourself."</p>

<p>Luckily, the dilemma never struck me. I had fully
resigned myself to death, when an enormous billow,
which only seemed advancing to swallow us up, left

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

me upon a shoal barely covered at low water, of which
I had no knowledge. With one arm I clung to the
rock, while with the other I now grasped my poor
Spirro. Thus we remained afloat, until a boat,
which just before had put off to meet me, reached
the reef, took us in, and brought us on shore.</p>

<p>Mavrocordato happened to walk with my father
on the quay when the accident took place. Apprised
of his son's danger, he had arrived in sight half
frantic with terror, just as, floundering on the waves,
I threw out my sash to Spiridion. He had gone
through all the agonies of every subsequent crisis,
until he saw us safely landed on the beach. Immediately
he ran or rather flew to the spot, and even
before he noticed his child clasped me convulsively
in his arms, as the preserver both of the son and the
father.</p>

<p>These expressions died away on my ear. Exhausted
with fatigue, I had fainted, and lay for half
an hour bereft of all perception. But on recovering
my senses I still found Mavrocordato by my side,
ministering to my relief, while poor Spirro was
drenching my cold features with his tears.</p>

<p>As soon as his father saw me sufficiently collected,
he resumed his boundless thanks, only interrupting
them to lay on his son a most positive injunction
ever to treat me as a brother; and in the face of all
around, and of heaven itself, he took a solemn engagement,
strengthened by every most sacred oath,

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

henceforth to consider me as his other child. "Happen
what may, Anastasius," he cried, sobbing with
emotion, "rest secure that I shall never abandon
you; that in me you will always find a second
father:" and indeed, from that day Mavrocordato
seemed to have no second object of solicitude (his
son always remaining the first) except to palliate my
frequent offences. Many a time he redeemed my
sins with the sums which he would have denied to
his own legitimate gratifications; and, had he been
at home, when the ripening effects of my imprudent
conduct made me become a voluntary exile, I might
not perhaps have fled, as I did, from my natural
parent and from my adoptive sire.</p>

<p>Since my abandonment of home I had lost sight
of Mavrocordato and his son. When I wanted
assistance most at Constantinople, and might have
benefited most by their kind offices, Mavrocordato
happened to be gone on business to Trieste or to
Vienna, I did not know which; and just before I
went to Chios, he had entirely quitted that island&mdash;a
theatre too confined for his extending concerns&mdash;and
had come to settle at Stambool.</p>

<p>In a capital of that description the love of riches
soon begets the love of sway. Mavrocordato, who
before only wished to leave his son distinguished
for wealth, now aspired at beholding him eminent
in rank and dignity. In short, he aimed at nothing
less than seeing him some day Bey of Valachia or

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

Moldavia, as several of his namesakes had been before
him; and all his endeavours now tended to
forming the requisite connexions at the Fanar.
Unfortunately he had not the lungs which ambition
requires. Accustomed to inhale the pure mountain
air of Chios, he found the confined atmosphere of
the capital agree ill with his health. Accordingly,
while he only retained at Constantinople a small
recess for business, he bought in the country, close
to the beautiful village of Kandilly, the villa of a
proscribed visier for his permanent residence. It
was there that, in one of my excursions, chance
again threw me in the way of my adoptive father.</p>

<p>There were two things in this rencontre which
surprised me, and to many will appear incredible:
the first was that Mavrocordato had not toiled like
a galley-slave for his son, while a boy, only that he
might fall out with him the more outrageously when
he was grown a man; the other, that he did not
consider, because nine or ten years had elapsed since
I saved that son's life, the natural term of a father's
gratitude as wholly expired: nor did he even think
that all the promises made to a Christian must fall
away on the misguided wretch becoming a Mohammedan.
When indeed Mavrocordato learnt that,
for reasons good or bad, I had changed my religion,
he looked a little dismayed; but soon recovering:
"The will of God," he cried, "be done!" and invited
me not the less to his mansion as cordially as if I

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

could publicly have pledged him in the wine of his
own growing. Perhaps a person who, in my situation,
could raise himself to rank, and had found
means to save money, might not, to a mind of
Mavrocordato's prudent cast, appear after all wholly
destitute of some laudable points. At least my host
received me as if he had thought so; and the very
day of our meeting wrote to my father, to acquaint
him with his rencontre, his pleasure and his grief.</p>

<p>Many letters between Stambool and Chios&mdash;I suspect&mdash;are
intercepted by the Tritons and the Nereids,
curious to know what passes above water;
but Mavrocordato's epistle was left by these submarine
gossips to take its course. There even
came as speedy an answer to it as the diligence of
man could indite, or the breath of a favourably disposed
servant of Eolus waft to its destination.
My host was conjured in the truly paternal epistle,
by every tie of ancient friendship, and every motive
of religion, to spare no pains in recalling a stray
sheep into the way of salvation. A postscript,
longer by half a page than the letter, stated that,
should my abjuration of my errors compel me to
quit the Turkish dominions, my wants would be
amply provided for in whatever nearest part of Christendom
I might make my abode. These assurances
moved me to tears. "Blessed be my aged parent!"
cried I,&mdash;"When permitted by those that surround
him, he still feels anxious for the welfare of his

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

Anastasius!" "And so do your brothers," whispered
to me Spiridion. "They had rather even that you
should return to your faith than that you should
revisit your island. So at least they write."&mdash;At
this speech a dark cloud again overcast the transient
sunshine of my heart.</p>

<p>As to Mavrocordato, he inquired not into the
motives, he only considered the merits of the request.
At all times he had been religiously inclined:
but he had extended the sphere of his devotion,
since he had contracted that of his liberality. He
gave more to God as he gave less to man;&mdash;no doubt
expecting the stake in heaven to bear the higher
interest. The arduous and delicate commission
entrusted to his prudence he undertook, not as a
mere act of duty toward a friend, but as an effectual
means of working his own eternal bliss. Had he
been offered the nursing of a visier's estate, instead
of the rekindling of a taooshan's extinguished faith,
he could not have engaged with more zeal in the
business. I believe he would even have paid me to
become once more a Christian, had I been in want
of money: but, finding that all I required was good
advice, he determined not to spare so cheap a drug,
and only considered how he might administer most
plentifully the unwelcome potion. Cunningly therefore
he bethought himself of making his solicitude
for my temporal concerns the means of advancing
his spiritual aim; and actually offered to manage

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

my property for me to the best advantage, free both
from commission and from brokerage! The thing
was in itself worth accepting, be what they might
the conditions annexed to it. I left my casket in
Mavrocordato's custody, empowered him to dispose
of its contents to the greatest profit, and even accepted,
at his urgent request, of an apartment under
his own roof.</p>

<p>Still he at first only ventured upon the performance
of the task, to which all this was preparatory,
with a very tender hand. He feared to excite my
impatience of control, or my jealousy of independence,
and carefully abstained from all that might
savour of the tone of a pedagogue, or the authority
of a parent. My well-bred host contented himself
with throwing out, when opportunities offered, such
delicate hints and such round-about insinuations,
as left it easy at my pleasure either to avoid their
hitting, to take off their point, or to let their whole
weight fall unnoticed beside me.</p>

<p>At last, however, Mavrocordato began to find
out that this over cautious way of proceeding did
not advance his purpose. Accordingly he resolved
upon a more open and undisguised mode of attack.
He now on all occasions enlarged upon the reprehensibleness
of my conduct, and the danger of my
evil courses; constantly represented me as standing
on the very brink of perdition, and never met me,
at home or abroad, without significantly shaking his

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

head, uttering a deep groan, and inflicting upon me
so vehement a lecture, that, whatever he might say,
I could never think myself obliged to submit to
the penalty of listening. This new method, therefore,
succeeded still worse than the former. Instead
of not heeding my host, I now carefully
avoided his company. Though still nominally an
inmate in his house at Kandilly, I was oftener to be
found at the furthest end of Constantinople: and,
always out in the morning before he came from his
office, and seldom returned at night ere he retired
to bed, it was but on very extraordinary occasions
that I indulged him with the sight of his very discreet
guest.</p>

<p>A third plan of operations was then resorted to.
In the idea that the son, from less disparity of age
and greater means of watching my behaviour, might
succeed in the scheme in which his father had failed,
Mavrocordato now committed the whole labour of
my conversion to Spiridion. This, undoubtedly,
evinced a thorough confidence in the steadiness of
the youth. Even spotless purity might risk, unless
composed of very hard and impenetrable stuff,
to contract in the office of cleansing such extreme
moral foulness as mine, a few unavoidable stains.</p>

<p>Independent even of the danger to which the
purpose of the father exposed the son, perhaps the
son was the person most unfit to forward the design
of the father. I do not mean on the score of insufficient

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

interest in my welfare. Far from it!&mdash;In the
exuberance of life's early spring, friendship strikes
root too deeply in the soul, and entwines itself too
closely round every fibre of the heart, to be enfeebled
or broken by the vicissitudes of later life. The intimacies
of that happy epoch, as they precede, also
survive all the more interested connexions of a
maturer age; and Spiridion's early devotion to the
companion of his childhood had not only kindled
up anew, but again glowed in his breast with all its
pristine ardour. Spite of my manifold failings, he
loved me at Constantinople as he had done at Chios:
but the scope of his understanding, so greatly exceeding
that of his father's, prevented his wishes for
my weal from being exclusively directed to the single
narrow point, in which centered all the views of
the latter. If he more than emulated Mavrocordato
in his solicitude to see me renounce my old sins, he
was far from feeling equal anxiety for my abjuring
my new worship.</p>

<p>Spiridion had received from nature an expansive
mind. It had resisted all the contracting powers
of a Greek education. In vain might its glance be
obstructed by the opaque blinds of ignorance, its
flights impeded by the leaden trammels of prejudice:
it could see through the one, and soar above the
other. As greater efforts were made to hem in on all
sides his powerful faculties, they seemed only to
derive superior strength from their concentration,

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

and to break with more irresistible force through
their insufficient barriers. While with all his canvas
spread to the breeze of the passing hour, the father
sailed down the muddy tide of the Fanar, the son
would retire to his closet, there to imbibe long
draughts of wisdom at the pure spring of philosophy:
and as, in a society where literary discourse is
despised or prohibited, men do not peruse books
merely to quote sentences, he found more leisure to
ruminate upon his reading, and to digest his volumes.
Hence his understanding rose far above the
level of his age and country: for in those days
modern Greece had not yet attained that miraculous
emancipation from the bondage of error and superstition,
so vauntingly set forth, I am told, by the
P&mdash;'s and the K&mdash;'s of the present enlightened period:
and in the more than Cimmerian darkness
which surrounded him, Spiridion was almost the
only person I could have named, with whom morality
weighed more than dogma, and who attached greater
importance to inward goodness than to outward
practices.</p>

<p>His behaviour and his exhortations wore the
stamp of this peculiar frame of mind. He did not
indeed say in explicit terms: "Those articles of
faith, those forms of worship, which affect not the
heart, and influence not the conduct, are of little
importance;"&mdash;the deference he bore his father
forbade such a speech: but, while he more faintly

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

urged, and only in the tone of an irksome task, an
ostentatious abjuration of Islamism, which might
only rid the mosque of a bad Moslemin, in order to
throw a worse Christian back upon the church;&mdash;while
he deprecated with all his might the scandalous
spectacle of a man running backward and forward
between Mekkah and Jerusalem, between the Cross
and the Kaaba&mdash;sometimes kneeling to the one, and
sometimes prostrate before the other;&mdash;while he
ventured to believe that even a good Moslemin
might still enter heaven, though with different credentials
and at a different gate, he insisted with all
the strength of his faculties and all the warmth of
his heart, upon those moral duties commanded by
the Koran as well as by the Gospel; he admitted
of no mode of compounding for those actions on
which depends not only our own happiness, but the
good or evil condition of our fellow creatures; he
ceased not to depict with all his eloquence and to
urge with all his rhetoric, the beauty of rectitude
and the wisdom of goodness; nay, he spoke of the
charm which purity of mind and dignity of manners
throw over our sublunary existence with such
earnestness and such unction, as if he wished me to
adopt them not from cold conviction but from
positive taste, and to regard myself as sacrificing
my terrestrial happiness, not in adopting but in
rejecting the restraints of decorum and of principle.
Whether with some real foundation for his opinion,

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

or only from the partial medium of friendship and
of gratitude through which he viewed my character,
he often would say he observed in me a singular
and romantic turn of mind, capable of becoming as
enthusiastic in the cause of virtue, as it had been
unrestrained in the career of vice. He believed
that the same energy and boldness which, while
wasted in fostering my evil passions, had made me
seek distinction in all that was profligate and base,
when employed to resist their sway, might render
me pre-eminent in all that was exalted and noble;
and he therefore felt all that eagerness for inlisting
me in the cause of moral excellence which was
natural to one, who, himself wholly devoted to its
charms, wished to extend its empire by procuring it
a powerful new champion. It is true, the prodigious
change in my disposition from the extreme
of ill to the extreme of good, was a transformation
which Spiridion rightly considered as attainable
only through immense efforts; and he regarded the
victory over my thus far ungovernable temper, the
triumph over my hitherto irresistible passions, as an
achievement no less arduous than it was desirable;
but that very circumstance, by rendering the success
as glorious to the conqueror as it was beneficial to
the conquered, added a new stimulus to my friend's
exertions in my behalf. It made him feel a pride
on his own account, as he felt an interest on mine,
in the accomplishment of the task he had set himself:

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

for he too was of an ambitious mind, and
more desirous of success in proportion as success
was more difficult.</p>

<p>The zeal which he felt from the first outset in his
undertaking, still grew as he advanced in his labours,&mdash;as
the very obstacles which he met with,
forced him to devote his time, his attention and his
powers more exclusively to his favourite purpose,&mdash;as,
by keeping his mind more steadfastly fixed upon
this single object, he weaned it more entirely from
all other pursuits; as in short, by the pains already
bestowed, he felt more committed not to cast them
away in a pusillanimous dereliction of his plan, ere
he reaped fruits worthy of his perseverance; and
he toiled with indefatigable zeal, until at last all his
other views and occupations yielded to that of my
sole amendment; until he devoted to my reformation
alone all the faculties of his understanding,
and all the energies of his heart; until he no longer
seemed placed by Providence on this globe for any
other purpose but that of making me a worthy
member of society; and until&mdash;almost working himself
up, in his honest enthusiasm, into a belief that
he had been appointed by the Almighty as my
guardian angel&mdash;he held himself responsible to his
Creator and to his conscience for my conduct, and
bound by the very gifts he possessed, to devote his
whole existence to the purpose of making mine a
blessing. To see me wise, to see me happy, and

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

that, through his exertions; nay, to sacrifice, if
necessary, his own repose and felicity on this globe
to mine, became the only bliss Spiridion aspired to
on this earth! Indeed, so fully had he identified
his fate with mine, or rather, so entirely had he reduced
himself to the rank of the mere instrument
of my salvation&mdash;not indeed by mere faith or even
insulated deeds of goodness, but by an entire reformation
of my conduct&mdash;that, had the irrevocable
decrees of fate destined one of us only to be accepted
among the host of heaven, I verily believe he would,
with all his ardour for excellence, have submitted to
stoop to the bitter fruits of sin, in order that Anastasius
might not be the one discarded from the
realms of bliss eternal!</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a temper such as mine, Spiridion was
perhaps, in spite of all his zeal&mdash;and I may add,
all his abilities&mdash;the person worst calculated, not
only to succeed in the more contracted purpose of
his father, but even in his own more extensive and
more liberal design; not only to obtain from me a
public and ostentatious return to my faith, but even
a more private, though more sincere, relinquishment
of my failings:&mdash;</p>

<p>For in truth,&mdash;up to the moment when my young
friend undertook my reformation, what was I?&mdash;A
being of mere instinct; a child over which the
cravings of the sense still reigned uncontrolled;
and which, like all children, still acknowledged no
subjection save to superior strength; still could be
made to obey the voice of reason, or even the dictates
of caution, by no other means but those of physical
compulsion; still must, as it were, have his submission
to the rules of society and the requisites of the
established order rendered a habit through dint of
force, ere it could become an act of choice; but
who, while thus still weak in intellect, wholly matured
nevertheless in bodily might, nay, possessing
with the mental imbecility of childhood more than

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

the ordinary corporeal endowments of grown up
man, required to find even more than the ordinary
gifts of body in other surrounding individuals, ere
he could be awed into an external allegiance to
social institutions, and, though he might, like other
children, in some degree be allured to good by the
mere imitative bias implanted in our natures, was
only disposed to make those members of society
the models of his conduct, who had begun by making
themselves the masters of his imagination; and to
take counsel where he felt a previous deference for
the person of the counsellor.</p>

<p>And thus far, alas! such had been the example
and the conduct of my chief associates, as only to
increase my natural aversion from the shackles of
civilization, and my repugnance to the mere approach
of those who bore them with meekness.
Gregarious indeed, though not sociable, I loved
not positively to prowl in solitary majesty through
the unreclaimed wilds of nature; I felt that some
species of companionship was unavoidable, even for
the mere purpose of assuaging the cravings of the
sense; but, like the rude tenants of the forest not
yet themselves lured into subjection by civilized
man, I only loved to herd with other beings equally
wild, indocile, and unbridled; I shunned every
fellow-creature already entrapped in the snares of
society; and could only bear to appear linked by
choice with such as, ever prone like myself to

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

deride every symptom of order, and to despite
every outward show of decency, were not less anxiously
avoided by the sober and steady part of the
community than the untamed lion or the unbroken
colt. Call it effrontery or bashfulness&mdash;temerity
or cowardice&mdash;I only felt at ease, only thought
myself safe as it were from the infection of contented
slavery, with men who bade defiance alike
to the precepts of morality and the injunctions of
the law; and the more an individual showed himself
broken into a ready compliance with all the requisites
of social institutions, and fearful to outstep
any of the rules founded on mere opinion, the more
I dreaded and avoided him on that very score as a
dangerous person, a confederate in the great plot
against my natural rights and liberties, and a rancorous
though secret enemy, who only coaxed and
caressed in order to betray me to his associates, and
to throw with more certainty the fatal noose round
my neck.</p>

<p>Add to this that, still wholly averse from the
most distant thoughts of quitting Islamism, still
elate with all the pride of the turban, I shrunk
from the idea of appearing guided in any degree
by one not like myself of the privileged cast, and
would sooner have seemed to take lesson or example
from a Turkish beggar than from a Greek
archon.</p>

<p>Now, of the qualifications which a disposition,

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

such as that of the worthy individual here depicted
required in his ghostly director, who possessed fewer,
and, on the contrary, of the attributes which must
disqualify their owner for the office of guiding a
pupil of that description, who reckoned more than
my friend Spiridion? Even in point of person he
wanted some of the conditions most indispensable
to the success of his undertaking. His figure was
elegantly moulded indeed, but, far from possessing
the size and strength requisite either to support or
to repress insolence, it was rather under-sized; and
the son of Mavrocordato appeared by my side like
the willow by the side of the cedar. Again: his
features were in as perfect a symmetry as Grecian
blood could bestow; but his countenance, unarmed
with that daring look which daunts the
brazen stare of audacity and defiance, habitually
only expressed gentleness, nay timidity: and if
bursts of indignation or of rapture would sometimes
impart to it an air so commanding and so lofty, as
to awe any being still under the influence of mind,
its purely intellectual power must nevertheless
remain unacknowledged, where&mdash;as in most of
my associates&mdash;all was mere unmixed matter. His
manners too were elegant and refined: but the more
they breathed that elevation and dignity calculated
to charm a well educated circle, the less they partook
of that coarse and vulgar assurance necessary to
please men of blunted feelings and a vitiated taste.

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

Reserved instead of forward, he never had a chance
of making the force of reason silence the force of
lungs; and, too proud to be conceited, too conscious
of his worth to announce his claims to notice, he
was only, by people apt greatly to presume upon
nothing and unable to understand a behaviour
wholly different, praised&mdash;if at all&mdash;for discreet and
becoming humility.</p>

<p>The sombre livery of Christianity too, by rendering
my friend a dark spot&mdash;almost a positive
blemish&mdash;in the brilliant circles of Islamism, increased
tenfold every difficulty of his arduous task:
for while his modest exterior could not prevent me,
who knew his inward excellence, from fearing his
watchful eye and feeling restrained by his observing
presence, it emboldened low-bred wretches to treat
him with a rudeness, the pain of which I shared.
Hence, though I could not but venerate Spiridion's
character, I mostly felt averse to his company,
and, so far from meeting the advances of the too
unexceptionable youth, discouraged his assiduity.
Sometimes, when he pressed me to make him my
associate and my confident, I used only to answer
jestingly, and say: "How can I possibly live with
you, or introduce you to those with whom I live,&mdash;you,
who have not one idea in common with them;
whose very language seems a different idiom, as
unintelligible to them as theirs is to you; who stare
at every unguarded expression, shrink from every

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

spirited proposal, and groan at every bolder frolic:
who stay at the door where others walk in, keep
watch where others slumber, and have the folly
to be wise where others have the wisdom to court
folly?" At other times I spoke more seriously,
and warned the youth in sober earnest against
wasting his valuable gifts in the fruitless attempt to
reform one, too long owned by sin to shake off the
allegiance. "How can you, Spiridion," would I
ask, "with your excellent understanding, expect
any good from a wretch so thoroughly broken into
every species of evil, so suppled by long practice
into every form of vice, so loose in all his mental
hinges, so dislocated in all his moral joints, that all
his inclinations turn with equal facility toward wrong
as toward right? The very transcendancy of your
merit,&mdash;my all good, all perfect friend,&mdash;leaves you
a far less chance of instilling in my corrupt mind
the smallest particle of righteousness than might
have befallen a person of inferior worth, less proudly
soaring above my own level, and whom I could
have met half way. You and I are too far asunder
in the scale of beings, ever to come in contact
together either in this world or the next." And
hereupon, in order to prove my assertion by illustrations
taken from facts, and to enjoy Spiridion's
surprise and horror, I would commence the braggadocio
of vice, and give my friend such details
of my iniquity, as made him raise meekly to heaven

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

his dark expressive eyes; till, unable any longer to
bear the revolting tale, he would start up, run to
me, put his hand on my lips, and supplicate me to
spare at least him, if not myself.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before even Spiridion
felt that nothing was so inimical to the success
of his scheme as a forbidding fastidiousness. He
therefore tried to repress his too evident disgust
at the tone and manner of my habitual associates,
and to bring himself (in appearance at least) more
nearly down to their level. In short, he gave up
his refined pursuits and his regular habits, for the
honour of holding in my esteem the same rank with
a set of blustering profligates. Upon the sublime
principle of seducing me to virtue, he became the
patient witness of all my vices. He followed me to
those temples where Aphrodite wears no veil, in
order to preach to me decency; and more than
once in the orgies at which he assisted, narrowly
escaped being the reeling victim to his own laudable
fervour for opening my eyes to the loathsomeness
of intoxication.</p>

<p>Even this effected not the wished for purpose.
Libertinism, as well as refinement, requires its apprenticeship.
It is not the attainment of a single
day, and sits as awkwardly on the wearer as fastidiousness,
where&mdash;only stimulated by the lips&mdash;it
flows not from the heart. Wherever Spiridion
followed in my train, he failed alike to catch the

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

spirit of the place, and the tone of the company.
His best attempts at extravagance only looked like
demureness run mad; and if his endeavours to set
my gayer friends at their ease had any effect at all,
it was only that of making them, whilst he was by,
as constrained as himself. The moment his name
was announced, every countenance fell and every
lip was sealed up. Adieu from that moment to
all that lightness of heart, all that flow of spirits,
without which vice itself, only pursued with the
dulness of a task, loses its seductive gloss, and,
for want of a brilliant exterior to dazzle the eye,
shows all its inward foulness. Instead of rendering
my associates pleased with him, Spiridion only contrived
to put them out of conceit with themselves.
The genuine sons of mirth and revelry dreaded
the intrusion of this false brother. Abashed at
the mere sight of one to whose manners they were
strangers, and to whose behaviour they had no
clue, they insensibly felt in his company&mdash;without
themselves knowing why&mdash;their assurance and
boldness degenerate into a subdued and humble
manner. Not but that they strove to resist the
novel influence. Fearful lest in his presence they
should appear to have lost their wonted tone, they
even talked louder than usual, were wittier, made
more jests, ironically wished me joy of my new
friend, and complained of his repartee as too much

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

for their dulness: but aside and by stealth, they
frowned at me for having brought an extinguisher
among their jovial troop; and I myself wished
from the bottom of my heart that Spiridion had remained
a complete saint, rather than that he should
have become half a sinner, for no purpose but to
spoil all the sport of genuine honest rakes!</p>

<p>But what of all this!&mdash;Be a man ever so sturdy
a hater of all that is good and wise, still, if fated
day after day to witness in another the most unabating
solicitude for his reformation, the most
untiring efforts to allure him to virtue; and these
endeavours proceeding, not from interested motives,
nor even from a wish to display superiority, but
solely from a desire the most ardent to procure his
lasting welfare: if above all forced to own that the
symptoms of this solicitude, never shown in intrusive
advice, irksome reproof, and acrimonious
censure, only appear in the keenest watchfulness,
the gentlest persuasion, the most exulting looks at
each instance of success, and the most evident dejection
at every failure in the benevolent attempt,&mdash;so
as not even to leave him a pretence to feign
anger and to fly from his monitor, he must have
in his composition materials even more compact
than mine, to remain wholly impenetrable to so
flattering a testimonial, lurking under reproof itself;
and to feel no wish, however transient, that it should

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

cost him less to reward with an amendment in his
manners so deep a devotion:&mdash;he will in spite of
himself repay such constant sacrifices, at least by
something more than cold and unprolific gratitude.</p>

<p>It is true, no person, wont to combine cause and
effect, could expect that in a vortex of unceasing
dissipation, and attracted by the voice of every siren,
my heart, volatile by nature, and by constant friction
somewhat blunted in its feelings, should return
with equal intensity Spiridion's affection. My regard
necessarily must have intermittances, display
fits and starts, and be interrupted by intervals of
forgetfulness, nay of coolness. In the pursuit of
pleasure I would shun the sight of the young Greek;
in the intoxication of enjoyment I would neglect
his society; in the phrensy of passion I would hide
myself from his view as from that of an unwelcome
monitor: but still did his daily converse here and
there drop a seed of tenderness and compunction
in my bosom; and this seed&mdash;often unheeded at
first, and resembling the corn which, in order to
germinate, must for a while be screened from the
rays of that sun, indispensable to its subsequent
development&mdash;failed not to spring up, when his
immediate presence no longer obstructed the more
general survey of his noble conduct and beneficent
precepts. In the midst of the raillery at Spiridion's

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

expense with which I tried to keep up the unconcern
and independence of my mind, I conceived
for him a real and deep-rooted attachment, and
though we rarely associated together in my hours
of joy, the moment I felt the least grief or disappointment&mdash;the
moment the faithlessness of a mistress,
the treachery of a companion, or the superciliousness
of a grandee cast the least cloud over my
happiness,&mdash;I darted past all my ephemeral friends,
to pour my feelings and my sorrows into the bosom
of their sole legitimate depositary. From his lips
alone I expected the balm of consolation; and
though long and distant were my flights, still would
I ever ultimately return to Spiridion's arms, as the
stork from the furthermost regions of the globe
returns constant to her wonted nest.</p>

<p>My growing regard for Spiridion, and my admiration
of his worth, awoke in my breast the first
cry of conscience, and the first risings of shame.
In the presence of my friend I would sometimes
repress the rashness of my temper, and regret the
violence of my passions. I blushed for the vices
in which I had formerly exulted. For the first
time in my life I took pains to excuse my errors,
and laid down plans for rooting out my ill-propensities.
I went so far as actually to meditate a
general reform; nor did I at any time put off the
execution to a very distant period. If I carried

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

not immediately my good intentions into effect, if
inveterate habit frequently made me relapse into
my evil doings, still did I no longer find in the
commission that zest, that unalloyed pleasure which
used to attend them, I felt the bitterness of remorse
follow the sweets of indulgence. So great
was the revolution in my sentiments, that it often
made me contemplate with envy the calm dignity
of Spiridion's life and occupations, which before I
had treated with contempt. Looking over him, when
he would hurry the completion of some noble work,
or lay by the pursuit of some interesting study, in
compliance with my eagerness for some low or
trivial pastime, I often could not help repining at
the difference of our disposition. "Ah," said I,
"Spiridion; why was it not my fate to be brought
up like you!&mdash;In me, too, nature had implanted
many a rich and varied germ. Cultivation might
have made them expand into all that was useful
and beautiful. Fragrant blossoms might have been
grafted on my stock full of vigour and sap; luxurious
fruits might have adorned my branches: but,
alas! I was born in a desert, I grew up remote
from the sunshine of civilization, and I put forth
only wild and fruitless boughs, distorted by ceaseless
storms, and casting wide around them a drear
and deadly shade!"</p>

<p>Nor was this all! Whenever Spiridion parted
from me to go into the presence of his God, to

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

prostrate himself before his Maker, and to listen
with devout attention to the loud hymns sung in
praise of his Saviour; whenever, in conjunction
with all his assembled countrymen, he addressed,
through the mediation of holy ministers, his supplications
to Heaven according to the forms of his
forefathers, and in that language which once had
been mine; whenever, in his doubts and perplexities,
he derived comfort from performing the awful
signs of his creed, and attending the sacred rites
of his ancient religion, I panted to follow him to
the place of my old worship, to kneel down by
his side before the holy doors<sup id="r228"><a href="#n228">228</a></sup> of the sanctuary,
and to join in his ardent and heartfelt devotions
at the altar of Christ. I repined at the solace he
was receiving, and of which I had deprived myself;
regretted that change which only permitted
me an open, a public, and a solemn approach to
my Creator and my Judge, in a strange house,
under a spurious garb, and in an idiom not my
own; loathed the Moslem rites, which, converting
every act of devotion I panted to perform into a
solemn mummery, bereft my appeal of its earnestness,
my prayers of their unction, and my worship
of its sanctity; and secretly vowed,&mdash;should I not
be able immediately to re-enter the pale of the
church I had abandoned,&mdash;at least some day before
my death to compel the holy gates to open to my
supplications, and again to admit within the dread

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

precincts&mdash;now closed against the renegade&mdash;my
sighs of shame, of contrition, and of penitence!</p>

<p>Thus did the gentle timidity of Spiridion end by
making a deep impression on my obdurate heart,
and resemble the frequent falling drop, which by
slow degrees hollows out the hardest stone. That
empire over my will, which the young Greek never
would have obtained had he attempted to assume
the least authority, he, by an almost unreserved
submission to my own caprice, now for many an
hour held undisputed.</p>

<p>It is however true, that the utmost actual amendment
in my ways still remained prodigiously short
of the quantity requisite to compose a particularly
valuable member of society. The effect of Spiridion's
exhortations rarely went beyond good resolutions:
seldom did they ripen into actual realities;
at least of such a nature as to claim peculiar praise.
The occasions on which I expressed the strongest
determination to become a new being, were often
those on which I relapsed into some old sin more
deeply than before. The very contrition, however,
which followed the misdeed, was already in one
who before gloried in evil, a great step towards
good; and the power in Spiridion to produce that
feeling, the sign of a vast hold obtained over my
wayward soul.</p>

<p>How great however was the toil, how constant
the watching of my friend to retain that feeble sway

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

over my furious passions, which he had with such
labour acquired! What unceasing terror he felt lest
my perverse instinct should again recover its noxious
preponderance over my still weak and giddy
reason! How he trembled for fear of seeing me, like
a young tiger half tamed, resume, at the faintest
scent of blood or glimpse of the forest, all my sanguinary
yearnings and all my roving inclinations,&mdash;break
my fetters, recover my ferocity, and forfeit
all the fruits of my tedious education!</p>

<p>And but too often still were all his sinister forebodings
on the point of being realised. But too
often still would I sigh at the remembrance of those
days, when no monitor from within checked the
freedom of my will and actions; when, if the voice
of pleasure called or the spur of instinct urged, no
second thought, no extraneous consideration held
me back; when, above all, no subsequent reflection,
no dread of reproof embittered the image of the
joys I had snatched from the fleeting wing of time,
and had made mine ere age advanced to scare away
their very shadow. Often still would I say to myself&mdash;"because
a little Greek, who is neither my
relation nor my master, happens to owe to me his
life, is he entitled to rob me of my liberty; or,
because his mind is by nature's own ordination
so regulated as without effort or sacrifice to pursue
a steady course, must my soul, which that same
nature has been pleased to render fiery, impetuous,

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

and without rule or measure, be, through dint of
the utmost violence, forced into the same even
pace?" Often, from feelings of contrition for my
offences, I relapsed into feelings of indignation at
the shackles imposed upon my will. Railing at
Spiridion for thwarting my inclinations, and at myself
for submitting to his yoke, I only saw in the
influence which he had gained over my mind an
usurpation, and in the restraint he put upon my
passions a tyranny. The fear I felt of his reproaches,
and the care I took to avoid his displeasure,
no longer seemed to me aught but a
wanton surrender of my rightful independence, a
disgraceful prostration of my freedom, which made
me weep with anguish, or rather gnash my teeth
for very rage. "Is it I,&mdash;is it Anastasius," I exclaimed,
"who suffers the silly and minute forms
of society, like the small but numerous threads and
meshes of a net, to confine every limb, and to impede
every motion? Is it I who have lost all free
agency, and like a puppet can only obey the pleasure
of another?" And at these mortifying thoughts,
shame burned in my cheek, and anger sat quivering
on my lips.</p>

<p>I then resolved to tear asunder my slight yet
heavy trammels, to assert my ancient freedom, and
afresh to roam at liberty. The passions, long restrained,
again broke loose with tenfold fury; and

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

the act, intended to manifest my recovered liberty,
was always some extravagance, far exceeding the
most outrageous of my former follies.</p>

<p>My friend, on these occasions, seemed lost in despair.
Breathless, except when now and then a
deep sigh forced its way from his inmost soul&mdash;like
the slow bubble, which rises from the very
bottom of the seemingly motionless pool&mdash;he hung
his head in gloomy silence, while, proud of my feat,
and like the steed turned loose in the meadow, I
snorted, shook my mane, and looked round with
taunting eye; until, after a certain time, the effervescence
of my blood again subsiding, I returned
to a sense of my folly, felt contrition for my excesses,
and blushed at my bravado. Then again
I execrated my ungovernable temper, beat in anguish
my throbbing breast, convulsively grasped my
friend's retiring hand, and, by confessing how little
I deserved it, in the end obtained his forgiveness.
Spiridion, who the moment before had renounced
all hopes of my reform, now again began with fresh
ardour to toil at his chimera.</p>

<p>The father's less pertinacious dream had meanwhile
wholly subsided. Spiridion might still expect
some day to bring me to the path of virtue;
Mavrocordato clearly saw that he was not the person
destined to lead me back to the porch of the
church. He almost began to think it possible that,

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

instead of his son's reclaiming me to Christianity, I
might end by seducing his son to Mohammedanism.
At any rate, he now deemed a familiar intercourse
with a personage of my description as equally injurious
to the sober habits of his family, and to the
commercial credit of his house. He first endeavoured
to intimate this new opinion to me by a
studied coolness and reserve, totally different from
his former cordiality. Unluckily, as I never had
courted his favour, I heeded not his change of
manner, nor considered the caprice of the sire as a
reason for withdrawing my countenance from the
unoffending son. Mavrocordato therefore was at
last obliged to be more explicit.</p>

<p>I had one evening made myself rather conspicuous
at Kandilly. The next morning, as I was sitting
with Spiridion, in walked his father, who had stayed
from his office on purpose. He inquired very civilly
after my health, hoped I had not caught cold, and
then apprized me in terms polite but peremptory,
that his occupations no longer permitted him to
manage my property, nor his views to cultivate my
society; returned me the remains of my deposit,
which my frequent draughts had greatly reduced;
presented me with an exquisitely penned abstract of
my account, which he begged me to approve at my
leisure; recommended to me to seek more complying
friends and a more convenient lodging;

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

and, taking his leave, wished me all manner of
happiness.</p>

<p>However politely Mavrocordato's compliment
might be turned as to the form, I could not help
thinking it very rude as to the matter. His behaviour
seemed to me both unfair and unhandsome. In
fact, was I the one that had made the first advances
to this purse-proud merchant? or had he, on the
contrary, first sought of me a renewal of intimacy?
He might have left me alone if he had chosen. I
asked not of him any attention,&mdash;I expected not any
civility: I should have been perfectly contented if
the accidental meeting had ended, as it had begun,
in the market-place. But to invite me to his house,
to press upon me his hospitalities, to admit of no
denial to his solicitations!&mdash;and all this only in order
that he might end the farce by turning me out of
his surly door, at which I hardly ever had cared to
present myself; and that without the least preparation
or warning!&mdash;It was what I could not brook,
and what I promised myself some day to resent.
Meantime, I determined not to trespass another instant
on the forbearance of one so anxious to recall
his bounty, and, spite of all Spiridion's entreaties
that I should at least stay the night, and all his
endeavours to convince me that his father could not
mean things as I understood them, I walked out:&mdash;nor
did I, until launched into the very middle of the

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

street, stop to consider how I was to dispose of
my person and my casket. Then, indeed, I felt
a little at a loss, and could have liked to walk in
again. But this my pride forbade.</p>

<p>I had not ruminated half a minute before I wondered
how I could have felt any embarrassment at
all. Within a stone's throw of Mavrocordato lived
the fittest person to succeed him as depositary of my
fortune and director of my actions: namely his most
rancorous enemy;&mdash;an Armenian, and a cashier,
who hated him with all the cordiality of one whose
commercial schemes had been less successful than
his own. There was no species of mischief which
the envious Aidin had not attempted to do his more
fortunate or more skilful neighbour. First, he had
endeavoured to ruin him by representing his wealth
as a mere fabrication. Unable to succeed this way,
he took the contrary method, accused him of being
too wealthy, and laid snares, no longer against his
credit, but against his life, by tracing his opulence
to a treasure of a beheaded Visier, found concealed
in his garden. But he was fated to be foiled alike
in his most opposite attempts at mischief. For
when, in order to circumstantiate his evidence, he
showed the officers of the fisc the place in the Greek's
garden, where from his window he had with his own
eyes seen him dig out the ponderous chests, filled
with gold and jewels, something more ponderous
was found still unremoved; namely, such an immense

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

and continuous stratum of solid rock, as,
without being great mineralogists, the very ministers
of the hazn&eacute; judged to have lain there undisturbed
since the flood.</p>

<p>Now the personage who had been at all these
pains to stamp himself a rogue, was the one whom
I sagaciously selected for the depositary of my
money:&mdash;nor shone my judgment less conspicuously
in disposing of my person.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> worldly affairs thus prudently arranged, I
attended to my spiritual concerns, and, to compensate
for not eating caviar during the Greek Lent,
fasted with all becoming regularity during the Turkish
Ramadan. Every one knows how trying that
month is to the temper of the stanch Mohammedan.
As long as the sun lingers above the horizon, he
dares not refresh himself with the least morsel of
food, the least drop of liquor, or even the least
whiff of tobacco. His whole occupation consists
in counting his beads, and in contemplating the
slow moving hand of his timepiece, until the moment
when the luminary of the world is pleased to release
him from his abstinence, by withdrawing its irksome
orb from his sight. Sufficiently disagreeable as the
month of the Ramadan might appear for every purpose
of salvation, even when it falls in winter, its
unwelcome intrusion seems absolutely invented for
the destruction of the Moslemin species, when the
precession of the lunar months brings it round to
the longest and hottest days of summer. It is then
that the Christian, rising from a plenteous meal, if

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

he has common prudence, avoids all intercourse
whatever with the fasting Turk, whose devout stomach,
void of all but sourness and bile, grumbles
loudly over each chance-medley of the sort as over
malice prepense, rises in anger at the supposed
insult, and vents its acrimony in bitter invectives.</p>

<p>Sometimes a demure Moslemin may be seen
looking anxiously round on all sides, to ascertain
that he is not watched. The moment he thinks
himself unobserved, he turns the corner of some of
the Christian streets of Pera or Galata, and ascends
the infidel hill.<sup id="r229"><a href="#n229">229</a></sup> Led on as it were by mere listlessness
from one turn to another, the gentleman still
advances, till perverse chance brings him just opposite
a confectioner's or a pastry-cook's shop. From
sheer absence of mind he indeed steps in, but he
buys nothing. Allah forbid! He only from pure
curiosity examines the various eatables laid out on
the counter. He handles, he weighs them, he asks
their names, their price, and their ingredients. What
is this? what do you call that? Where does that
other come from? What huge raisins these are!
Thus discoursing to while away time, he by little
and little reaches the inner extremity of the shop;
and, finding himself at the entrance of the recess, in
which by mere accident happens to have been set
out&mdash;as if in readiness for some expected visitor&mdash;a
choice collection of all that can recruit an exhausted
stomach, he enters it from mere thoughtlessness,

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

and without the least intention. Without the least
intention also, the pastry-cook, the moment he sees
his customer slunk into the dainty closet, turns upon
him the key of the door, and slips it into his pocket.
Perhaps he even goes out on a message, and half
an hour or so elapses ere he remembers his unaccountable
act of forgetfulness. He however at
last recollects his prisoner, who all the while would
have made a furious outcry, but has abstained, lest
he should unjustly be suspected of having gone in
for the purpose of tasting the forbidden fruit. The
Greek unlocks the door with every expression of
apology and regret; the Turk walks out in high
dudgeon, severely rebukes the vender of cakes, and
returns home weaker with inanition than ever. But
when the pastry-cook looks into his recess, to put
things in order, he finds, by a wonderful piece of
magic, the pies condensed into piastres, and the
sugar-plums transformed into sequins.</p>

<p>I suppose my new banker suspected me of sometimes
dealing in this unlawful sorcery, and wished
to destroy the transmutations in their very source.
He disappeared with my casket. On the twentieth
day of the Ramadan I found myself with a tremendous
appetite, five sequins in my pocket, and
not a farthing elsewhere.</p>

<p>Ever since my final exit from Mavrocordato's
house, Spiridion had kept completely aloof from
me, and I had not once seen my till then inseparable
friend. That he was a dutiful son, I knew; that

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

he would not openly fly in the face of his father, I
had expected; but I was not prepared to find that
where his friend was concerned, he would conform
to his parent's orders with such rigid punctuality.
It mortified me; and, as prompt as ever to value
things only when forbidden, I now began to long
for the youth's company: "After all, how preferable,"
thought I, "was his society to any other!
What information he possessed, what knowledge
he imparted! How full of resource was his mind,
and of variety his conversation! How different
from the empty rattle of men whose ideas never
moved out of a single narrow circle, and whose
efforts at jocoseness absolutely sickened with repetition.
How many more acute observations on
life at large he used to make, who only seemed
to view its storms and whirlwinds from a remote
estuary, than those who sailed down its fullest tide.
The very reflection of his excellence cast a lustre
upon those who were placed within its influence.
They felt greater self-esteem from being in his
company;"&mdash;and I could not forgive myself for so
wantonly forfeiting what was so valuable in itself,
and yet so willingly bestowed!</p>

<p>Still, if even prior to the loss of all that I possessed,
I had felt too proud to seek one who shunned
me, it may well be supposed that since that event, I
should more than ever spurn all attempts at renewing
the intercourse. However great might be my
distress, I would rather have thrown myself upon

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

the generosity of an absolute stranger than upon the
kindness of a forgetful friend.</p>

<p>Whatever I might have imagined, such a friend
the son of Mavrocordato was not born to be. Two
days had scarce elapsed since the retreat of the
Armenian, when, as I lay despondingly on my couch,
who should I see standing beside me, like a cheering
vision, but my still true Spiridion! The disappearance
of the banker had soon been published, and
amply commented upon, in the commercial world.
Spiridion knew my little property to be in his hands.
He had immediately inquired into my circumstances,
and, apprised of my ruin, had come to my
relief.</p>

<p>His pecuniary offers he found me unwilling to
accept. "Your friendship, Spiridion," cried I,
"is dearer to me than ever; but away with your
purse! It offends my eyes. I love you too well to
become your debtor."</p>

<p>"Selim," replied the son of Mavrocordato, "if
that which affection bestows demands a return of
gratitude, believe me, it is too late to escape the
irksome burthen. You are already too deeply in
my debt for all the anxiety you have cost me. In
the scale in which your reformation has outweighed
all consideration of my own repose, in which your
welfare has preponderated over all my worldly interests,
a handful of paltry gold is but a speck of
dust&mdash;an atom void of weight!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

<p>I felt the truth of this speech, bade my foolish
pride be silent, and accepted the money. "This gift,"
exclaimed I&mdash;clasping the purse with both hands,
and placing it next my heart&mdash;"will enable me to
prove that your friendship has not been thrown
away; that the seeds you toiled to sow, though
slow to rise, have sprung up at last: their fruits will
soon appear. Henceforth, Spiridion, I tear from
my bosom every root of evil; henceforth I renounce
all the pleasures of vice; henceforth I become a new
man, thy boast, thy credit, and thy glory!"</p>

<p>These words, the first of the sort which my friend
had ever heard me utter, sounded in his ears like
music from heaven. Tears of emotion started from
his eyes; he embraced me with convulsive rapture.
What more could he wish for? His long sought
triumph was complete; and, like men on the morrow
of a victory which terminates a toilsome war, we had
only to sit down and discuss at leisure the new plan
of life, suitable to my new resolutions. Upon this
we enlarged as upon a delightful dream&mdash;soon to be
realised, till, fearing to stay longer, Spiridion at last
rose to tear himself away from me.</p>

<p>Evening was stealing on, and darkness beginning
to let loose all the hounds of hell that shunned the
light of day. It was scarce safe for Spiridion to
return home without some escort. "Stay, Spirro,"
said I; "this once let me be permitted to accompany
you. Even your father, just now, I am sure,

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

would wish to know me by your side."&mdash;Spiridion
consented.</p>

<p>Our way lay by a coffee-house, the favourite resort
of those against whom more domestic doors
were shut. On the threshold stood lounging a boy&mdash;the
son of a Capidjee<sup id="r230"><a href="#n230">230</a></sup> of the Porte&mdash;with whom
I had already once or twice had a tift. Achmet
was his name, insolence his profession. His behaviour
had made him the pest of the whole neighbourhood.
As soon as he spied us: "What," cried he,
"the old inseparables again risen from the dead!
See how the hound lugs the hog by the ears!" At
these insulting words I felt the blood rush in my
face; rage convulsed my whole body: I grasped my
handjar; but at the same instant the remembrance
of my recent promise to my friend flashed across
my mind; and, smothering my indignation, I silently
hurried on.</p>

<p>Spiridion, who had turned pale with anticipation
of the consequences that might arise from so grievous
an insult, observed the struggle in my bosom:
"Anastasius," said he, "I see all, and I thank
you. But suffer me to pursue my way alone. In
the land where my ancestors held the sceptre, I am
become thy reproach."</p>

<p>"What, Spiridion," replied I, "when you come
to save me, I, leave you in danger! I, leave you
exposed to the insult of the bigot, and the blows of
the ruffian? Never!"&mdash;And spite of my friend's

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

entreaties, I continued by his side until his own door
opened to afford him safety. I then pressed his hand,
bade him farewell, and returned my own way.</p>

<p>The lateness of the hour quickened my pace. In
the most lonely part of the road I overtook Achmet,
likewise on his way home,&mdash;and passed, without
seeming to notice him, by the swaggering coxcomb.</p>

<p>His sagacity had construed into fear my preceding
endurance. Accordingly, his insolence only
derived fresh increase from this conduct. "Coward,"
exclaimed he, "you run too fast for me to take the
pains of pursuing you: but I depute this messenger
to give you my errand;" and on my looking round
to see what he meant, I felt a huge stone graze my
ear. But for the motion of turning round my
head, it must have broken my jaw.</p>

<p>Human patience could endure no longer. I faced
the ruffian. Each lifted his hand, but mine was
the dagger which went first to the heart. My antagonist
fell without a groan. I paused a while,&mdash;but
he had ceased to breathe! Raising the lifeless
body, I threw it over a wall into an adjoining
cemetery, and walked off.</p>

<p>No mortal had beheld the conflict: but the prior
provocation had had all Kandilly for its witness.
What the darkness of the night awhile concealed,
the dawn of the next day could not fail to bring to
light; and to no one but me would the deed be
imputed. Achmet indeed was abhorred, but his

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

parents were respected. Having therefore much to
apprehend from the law, and little means to purchase
justice, I determined not to try which would
carry the day.</p>

<p>Still, however, before I abandoned for ever the
vicinity of my only friend, I determined to see him
once more. By another way, I ran back to his
house. For the first time since his door had been
shut against me, I knocked. He recognised my
hand. It was the signal I used to give, when, coming
in late from my evening rambles, I feared to disturb
his father. He himself opened to me.</p>

<p>"Spiridion," said I, "but an hour ago, I pledged
all I could pledge to make you witness in me an
entire reformation. Alas, it is no longer time! I
only return so soon to bid you adieu for ever.
Forget me; forget a wretch whom his ill fate pursues;
and thank heaven that you thus are rid of
one on whom misfortune has set its special mark!"</p>

<p>I then told him what had happened; mentioned
where I meant to go; and imploring the Almighty
to shower on my tender, my last, my only friend,
his choicest blessings, once more pressed to my
arms the companion of my childhood, and broke
away.</p>

<p>But little time was requisite to deliver over the
few articles I left behind me into the care of my
hostess, to saddle my horse, and to ride to Iskiudar.<sup id="r231"><a href="#n231">231</a></sup>

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

There I crossed the channel, entered Constantinople
just at the dawn of day, and traversing its long and
still empty streets from end to end, went out again
at the gate of Andrinople, across field and common
gained the western road, and about the middle of
the day, reached the town of Rodosto.</p>

<p>In this out of the way place I thought myself
safe, at least for a few hours; and, feeling much
fatigued, went to a kind of coffee-house, asked for a
private room, and lay down on the floor to take
a little rest. I had scarce begun to doze, when I
was suddenly roused by a loud knocking and by a
sort of rumour immediately ensuing, of which I
seemed the object.</p>

<p>I listened, though without getting up, and for
some time could only confusedly make out inquiries
on one side, and answers on the other. At last
one sentence distinctly struck my ear, uttered by
some one of the party within&mdash;"He is up stairs
and alone:"&mdash;it sufficed for my information. Nothing
could be more evident than that my exploit
had been discovered, and my footsteps traced. The
only thing now left for me to do, was to sell my
devoted life as dear as possible. Already was the
posse hurrying up stairs, and approaching my door.
I drew my yatagan, and cried out with all my
might; "Whoever enters, dies!"&mdash;but such was
the noise outside, that my threat remained unheard:

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

at least it was not heeded. The door burst open:
in rushed my pursuer, and down fell my sword&mdash;upon
my own Spiridion!</p>

<p>The sight of my friend had not been able entirely
to stop my uplifted arm; but it broke the force of
the blow. The weapon fell innocuous, and Spiridion,
at first quite breathless, and unable to utter a
syllable, by degrees recovered his breath, sat down,
and spoke as follows.</p>

<p>"You are surprised, Anastasius, to see me again:
but listen. When last night, after your departure,
I lay down&mdash;amazed at what had happened&mdash;to
reflect upon your conduct and my duties, I persuaded
myself that among those contending in my
breast, the more recent obligations contracted towards
a friend ought to yield to the prior claims of
the parent; and confirmed myself the more in this
idea, as all my wishes leaned the other way. The
struggle indeed between inclination and reason was
long and fierce: but at last I began to conceive
a hope that the impulse to follow you, at first
almost irresistible, had been entirely conquered. In
vain, however, I sought repose,&mdash;in vain tried to
close my eyes in sleep! My mind found no rest,
and a feeling of inexpressible anguish invaded my
body. While I lay, oppressed by an insufferable
weight, but unable to stir and throw it off, my door
gently opened, and, without the least noise, a form

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

glided in which approached my bedside. It was
that of my departed mother:&mdash;of her whom I loved,
and lost the first!</p>

<p>" 'My son,' it said&mdash;looking sternly in my face,
and with an air of settled melancholy, which thrilled
me to the heart,&mdash;'vows of gratitude are recorded
by angels, and only demons blot them out. He
who at this moment&mdash;breaking the solemn silence
of the night&mdash;with his horse's heavy hoof shakes
the ground over my head, saved thy life at the
risk of his own, in days that seem forgotten. For
the more daring act of saving it a second time, a
second time his own is threatened,&mdash;not by nature,
but by man. In return for his first deeds of love,
my son, thy very father already made thee promise
to regard him as a brother; and thou wouldest, now
that their sum is doubled, leave that brother to
perish, as a lonely, friendless outcast!'</p>

<p>"Here the dread shade ceased to speak. But
much as I tried to answer, I had not the power.
My jaw was of stone, and my tongue cleaved to
my palate. The vision disappeared. A loud clap
like thunder shook to dust my imaginary fetters;
I started up,&mdash;and obeyed the voice from heaven."</p>

<p>Spiridion said no more. I looked at him in astonishment.
"Is it you," I cried, "my friend!&mdash;you,
till now so inaccessible to every form of superstition,&mdash;that
canst mistake the dream of an agitated

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

mind or the night-mare of a suffering frame, for a
voice from above? Ah! ere you give way to such
delusions, reflect but one moment on what may
be the consequence. Consider who you are, and
what destinies await you. Remember that on you
depends the happiness of an affectionate parent,
and the preservation of a noble family; that for
you are reserved the respect of dependents, the
wealth of relations, and the honours of the world:
think that I, on the contrary, am a wretch, ruined
in fortune and in fame, rejected long ago by his
friends and family, now renounced by his fellow-citizens,
and proscribed by the laws of his country: then
say yourself that between us no further society can
subsist, no common interests can be maintained; that
far from offering to follow my fate, it is your business
to fly from my society as from a pestilence, and to
avoid the contagion of my breath, which must at
last involve all who remain within its reach. I
myself could not allow you to barter your advantages
against my wretchedness; could not permit
the sufferings of my friend to increase the sins
already on my head: I myself must implore you
to remember your now grieving father, and to forget
for ever the lost, the miserable Anastasius."</p>

<p>"Cruel friend!" replied Spiridion, "talk not to
me of the world. Was I ever elate with its blandishments,
or solicitous for its distinctions? My
father indeed . . . . . but who more earnestly than

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

he urged at all times my prior duty to my God?
Who oftener dwelt upon the paramount sacredness
of the engagements contracted with heaven? Let
then the vision I beheld have been real, or have
arisen only within my own heated brain; still has it
spoken what I must accomplish; still dare I not
desert my brother. Since then heaven wills you to
go, I must not stay behind. Under Hassan's banners
my friend purposes afresh in Egypt to pursue
the path of fame. Well!&mdash;with him I may go;
with him I too may run the race of glory! We
shall fight side by side. Perhaps I may some day
save your life, as you once saved mine. Perhaps,
vouchsafed the bliss to shed my blood for my
friend, I may die on his bosom the death of the
brave! or,&mdash;if Providence should guard us both,
should permit both to live,&mdash;triumphant with thee,
I shall with thee return; and with thine lay my
laurels at my exulting father's feet! Does not
Mavrocordato himself&mdash;prizing his son's elevation
beyond that son's existence&mdash;destine me to those
high offices, whose approach is over daggers, and
whose end is the bow-string? Thus already inured
to danger ere I enter my career, already armed
with martial renown ere I encounter my rivals, I
shall with greater confidence commence the struggle,
and with greater vigour contend for the prize,&mdash;sought
by a father's ambition under a son's borrowed
name!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

<p>"No, Spiridion," answered I, "it shall not be!
In accompanying me, thou goest not to renown:
thou goest only to disgrace, perhaps to perdition.
Thou assumest the appearance of my accomplice.
Thou coverest with dishonour a thus far spotless
name. Thanks to my conduct, I am alone in the
world; I belong to no one but myself; I am a
twig torn from its stem, that strikes no root, and
bears no blossom. My existence goes for nothing in
the sum of earthly things: my lonely fate involves
no other destiny! The weed of my sterile existence
any one may pluck up, may tear, may cast upon a
dunghill&mdash;and no loss be felt, no regret expressed,
no cognisance taken of the deed; no tear, save by
thee, shed over my remains, nor any flower, save by
thee, planted on my lonely grave! Of what importance
is it where I may wander, or what may
become of me? But thou, to plunge headlong
from the summit of earthly blessings into the abyss
in which I already lie prostrate; thou, to mix thy
fair name with the foulness of mine . . . . no, no, it
cannot, it shall not be!"</p>

<p>Here the young Greek's tone and manner changed
at once entirely. "Anastasius," cried he with a
rage so concentrated that it almost looked like
calmness; "you may spurn me from your side,
you may proceed without me: but mark the consequence.&mdash;I
return to Constantinople, I go before
the judge, and, in the face of the whole public,

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

I proclaim myself what I am,&mdash;the murderer of
Achmet!"</p>

<p>It now became evident that emotion and fatigue,
acting on a susceptible frame and a mind always
exalted, had produced in Spiridion that degree of
excitement which rendered further opposition dangerous.
I thought it best for the present to give
way; bowed, and submitted.</p>

<p>On my first arrival at Rodosto, I had desired my
horse might be sold for me, and a boat hired to
continue my journey. In their excessive zeal for
my service, the good people of the house had parted
with my steed for half his value, and had taken a
barge at double the usual fare: but it was not a time
to mind minute miscalculations. The boatmen were
waiting; I stepped in, and Spiridion followed. Before
the sun had set, the wind, in conjunction with
the current, carried us out of the boghaz into the
open sea.</p>

<p>Just as we launched into the wide basin of the
Archipelago, the sun's brilliant disk was majestically
dropping behind the distant peaks of Athos, whose
gigantic and insulated mass, alone dimly beheld
soaring above the silver wave, looked like the huge
spirit of the deep, emerged from its dark caverns to
survey its domain. With the last departing rays
of the orb of day also died away the breeze, leaving
the liquid plain as smooth as a mirror.</p>

<p>The monotonous stroke of the oar, falling upon

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

the waters in slow and steady cadence, now remained
the only sound which broke the universal silence,
and insensibly its solemn and regular return disposed
me to ruminate on my portion of life already
wound off.</p>

<p>"How whimsical a thing," thought I, "is man's
immutable destiny! How variously seem contrasted
its most proximate vicissitudes, and yet, how intimately
are linked its furthest incidents: by how many
anterior minute and hidden agencies is often irresistibly
produced the last and sole ostensible cause of
the weightiest events! How entirely is the will that
seems spontaneously to urge us on, an unavoidable
offspring of circumstances wholly independent of
that will, since they are prior to the very existence
of the being whom it sways! A fair form arises in
Damascus; and this form, just caught by my eye
from a distance as it flits away&mdash;this form, never
before or since beheld, makes me throw down a
Frank on the steps of the mosque, crop a friar's
beard in a barber's shop, seek refuge from the governor
of a province in the vortex of the capital,
incur in protecting an old friend the insolence of a
stranger, rid the world of a ruffian for threatening
my own life, and again abandon Stambool to fly
. . . . God only yet knows to what remote part of
this ill conditioned globe!</p>

<p>"How fearfully above all blood begets blood!
Had I not many years before slain a Greek under

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

the walls of the capital, I should not have spilled
mamluke blood under the battlements of Cairo, nor,
by a recoil as distant as the first impulse, again have
shed Turkish blood in Constantinople's suburbs.</p>

<p>"But stay;&mdash;in this filiation of slaughter was I
entirely passive? Had my own temper no share
in the sanguinary parentage? Did not the untowardness
of my own disposition give fertility to
otherwise barren circumstances? If at one time I
durst have owned a friend, at another could have
pardoned an enemy, at a third have held in the
contempt which he deserved a silly coxcomb, had
not the treble generation of murders been stifled in
the birth, the causes that brought them forth remained
childless, and the black offspring wasted
away in the vast womb of time?</p>

<p>"True indeed!&mdash;But that <i>if</i>, the indispensable
condition of the more favourable alternative; what
prevented its growing into a reality? What mixed
up with my temper those fiery, those combustible
ingredients, always ready to explode, to silence my
reason, and to raise my hand ere my mind could
check the blow?&mdash;was it myself? Certainly not:&mdash;for
if, at my outset in life, the option had been
given me, how gladly would I have received, instead
of a bias to evil and its bitter fruits, an
inclination to good, and its beneficial consequences!</p>

<p>"But to whom," I exclaimed inwardly, "is such
an option granted? In whom does not the inclination

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

preponderate either on the side of good or evil,
only according to the examples beheld, the lessons
taught, the circumstances experienced, the very constitution
inherited from parents, and the elements
imbibed from climate and from food, prior to the first
dawn of individual volition? However prone man may
be to think himself endowed with free agency, as
soon as his actions correspond with his own wishes;
however much he may forget that those very wishes
are not free; however much he may regard his will
as spontaneous, from its being often so nicely poised
between agencies so numerous, so complex, so minute,
so intimately connected with every most
distant prior circumstance, that it yields irresistibly
to impulses of which the precise period, and place,
and boundary, and existence even cannot be definitely
recognised, it is not the less true that&mdash;unpossessed
of the smallest component particle of
body or of intellect, of will or of knowledge, of
sensation or of thought, which, if his Maker be
really the sole creator, upholder and mover of the
universe, is not an emanation from, a part of that
very Maker; incapable of performing the most
trifling action or conceiving the most transient desire,
which, if there be a single first cause of all sensible
effects, does not proceed originally from the express
will of that first cause alone; liable to no temptation
of which the first seeds have not been sown by that
first cause itself; and fraught by that first cause

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

alone with the strength which resists, or the weakness
which yields to their blandishments&mdash;man is from
his first breath unto his last, as wholly passive an
instrument in the hands of Providence as the insentient
plant, or the unorganised mineral; conforms
as fully to the irresistible decrees of heaven in doing
what is blamed, as in performing what is praised;
becomes guilty of as flagrant an act of rebellion to
his ruler in attempting to decline the task of evil as
that of good set down for him;&mdash;or rather,&mdash;where
he most fancies he rebels against, still most implicitly
obeys that ceaseless ruler; and leaves heaven itself
as exclusively accountable for the mischiefs of the
moral world, as it is for those of the mere physical
creation,&mdash;for the destruction caused by conquerors
and statesmen, as for the havoc produced by earthquakes,
floods, hurricanes, famine and pestilence. To
eat and be eaten by each other is the business assigned
us here below by our Maker himself:&mdash;and, much as
I may regret the greatness of my appetite, how can
I more restrain it than the wolf or the vulture?"</p>

<p>At this somewhat disheartening period of my
reasoning, a new light flashed suddenly upon me.
It struck my sublime intellect that, if Omnipotence
had not merely permitted, but had itself positively
ordained, on this transient globe of wailing, good
to be still mixed with evil, production with destruction,
knowledge with error, and happiness with
suffering, this ordination was only a more palpable

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

effect of Almighty goodness than any other apparently
more desirable disposition could have been:&mdash;
that so far from this temporary conflict of interests
and passions being decreed for the cruel purpose of
punishing the man, who yields to temptations which
need not have assailed him, it was in reality only
with the benevolent design of teaching creatures all
destined for ultimate felicity, through the means
of some intervening sufferings, that which a state
perfect from the beginning could not have taught,&mdash;namely,
the eternal difference between evil and
good, ignorance and knowledge, misery and happiness:
in order that they might thus, through the
unceasing comparison of their opposite effects, more
forcibly feel when attained the ineffable bliss of that
new existence where good is to be freed from evil,
and joy to reign without the alloy of pain.</p>

<p>But man will never be satisfied:&mdash;for even in this
arrangement (liberal as it seemed upon the whole)
I still perceived a clause at which to cavil. I still
thought that those ill-fated wretches, selected as
it were from their very birth and wholly without
their consent, for the purpose of serving through
the mischiefs they were doomed to perform and the
miseries they were destined to suffer, as examples,
as warnings, as foils to the rest of mankind, might
have reason to complain of partiality in the decrees
of Providence, at least during its present temporary

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

dispensations;&mdash;unless indeed, as seemed fair, these
unfortunate evil-doers in this world were to be made
adequate amends in the next, by an additional share
of rewards and of glory. But, as I was not at all sure
of such a compensation being intended; as, on the
contrary, I almost feared that there might still be
in store for these unfortunates, even hereafter, a
sort of fiery process, for the sole purpose of purifying
and bringing them to the precise standard of
perfection, requisite to associate with the elect by
right of birth, I began to feel wroth at being myself
(as I suspected) among these pitiable wretches,
forced to perform all manner of mischief for the
general benefit; repined at the mortifying part
allotted to me on this vilely got-up stage, and wholly
lost what little patience I thus far had evinced in
following up my cue. In short, I determined no
longer to forfeit the certain for the uncertain, but
immediately to throw off my compulsory character,
and&mdash;whatever punishment I might incur for my
disobedience,&mdash;forthwith to become a very pattern
of virtue, in spite of heaven itself!</p>

<p>But alas! I found there is no contending with the
powers above: I soon discovered that the scheme
which I was meditating is more easily planned than
executed. Spiridion, whom till that moment I had
looked upon as my good demon&mdash;as the angel
appointed to guard me from evil,&mdash;was in reality

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

the spirit destined to scare me from good. Perceiving
the strong labour in my mind, he set aside his
usual caution, and, in the mistaken idea of availing
himself of the propitious moment, commenced so
dark a picture of my vices ere my virtuous resolves
were well matured, that my self-love&mdash;that infernal
and ever watchful sprite&mdash;suddenly felt alarmed,
flapped its raven wings, and took the field. At once
the current of the salutary reflections spontaneously
sprung up in my breast, became totally stopped by
the fear lest my companion might think me subdued
by a sense of my forlorn situation. Angrily interrupting
his lecture&mdash;"I agreed," cried I, "to
the society of a friend, not to the admonitions of a
preceptor. It is unfair to get me into a small boat
out at sea, in order to pursue me with lectures from
which I cannot escape!"</p>

<p>This sally, though it made Spiridion smile, still
left me ruffled; and a little after, when my friend,
after spreading out our little provision, looked for a
knife to divide them, I offered him my handjar, still
crimsoned with Achmet's frothy blood. He said nothing,
and only turned away his head:&mdash;but as he
leaned over the side of the boat, I saw big round
tears drop into the waves. Night, meanwhile, had
stolen on, and our little silent skiff, filled with
mourning, and encompassed by darkness, looked
like the barge which carries to the regions of wailing
the souls of the damned.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

<p>The hours of darkness passed without further discourse;
but early in the morning Spiridion, thinking
me more calm, ventured on what he called another
appeal to my reason. The very word deprived me
of what little I had left. "Appeal to my affections,"
exclaimed I: "bid me do one thing or leave another
for the love I bear you, but talk not to me of reason.
I hold the cursed gift in abhorrence. It is the source
of all our errors, the mother of all our mischiefs.
The brute, who has only instinct to guide him, is
sure to act right: but human beings, with their
miserable reason, are always acting wrong, and acting
wrong through the persuasions of that reason itself.
For, if they are liable to evil passions of which
brutes have no conception; if they experience
avarice, and ambition, and pride&mdash;those feelings
most fertile in crimes and in havoc among the
human species,&mdash;to what do they owe this unfortunate
distinction, but to the impulse of a reasoning
faculty which happens to mistake its way? And if
they have been able to accomplish mischief beyond
what brutes could have imagined; if they have
succeeded, for instance, to double on this globe
through such inventions as printing, cookery, and
gunpowder, the three evils of infidelity, disease, and
premature dissolution, what again have they to
thank for the advantage but their inestimable reason?
It is no doubt in mercy to the human species,
that, of all its baneful faculties, that of reason, on

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

which it prides itself most, should have been made
to develope the last, and to slumber the oftenest."</p>

<p>"I suppose, then," said Spiridion, "it is only
for fear of appearing too reasonable, that you, who
do not think yourself accountable to heaven, and,
indeed, are not over nice how you act by your
neighbour, yet make your neighbour pay so dearly
for any injury he may attempt to do you?"</p>

<p>"Listen," replied I with becoming gravity. "As
to the duties between man and man; if my life
or happiness depend upon the bread, or money, or
jewel which happen without my consent to be in
my neighbour's hands, assuredly I do not see why
I should so far prefer his interests to my own as
to leave them there, if I can do better for myself.
Upon the same principle I defend against my neighbours
what I already have gotten; and, as I ward
off impending injuries, so I retaliate injuries received,
in order to prevent a repetition; but in all this
I feel no ill humour towards my neighbour, allow
him a complete reciprocity of rights against myself,
and, though I should even occasionally find it necessary
to kill, in order to settle whose right shall prevail,
I presume not to blame, and think myself not
entitled to punish."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Spiridion archly; "and when
would you, pray, first think chastisement lawful?"</p>

<p>"As soon," answered I, "as, by an express, or
even tacit, but acknowledged agreement between certain

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

individuals, each had ceded to the rest his
natural indefinite right over their persons and properties,
in return for other definite concessions at
once more restricted and more advantageous; and
had voluntarily submitted to certain penalties on infringing
this agreement."</p>

<p>"Well said!" exclaimed my friend; "you have
described the social compact,&mdash;the source of every
law, the cement of every state; and, since you not
only have acknowledged its sacredness but subscribed
to its terms, by claiming its support both as
subject and as ruler, what more have you to do
but henceforth to abide, while this empire subsists,
by all its stipulations?"</p>

<p>Here I rubbed my eyes. "Am I alive," cried
I, "and awake; and do I hear a Greek, and
under the yoke of the Turks, talk of a social compact&mdash;of
an agreement intended for mutual benefit,
support and protection, as of a thing actually subsisting;
as of a thing that should regulate his conduct
to his masters? Ah! had I only discovered
the faintest trace of any such agreement between
Christianity and Islamism, and had I found, in those
for whose security it was framed, the least disposition
to enforce its terms and to resist its infraction, who
would have been more proud than myself of remaining
a Greek, of standing by my oppressed countrymen,
and of maintaining the glorious struggle to the
last drop of my blood! But it was because in these

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

realms the contract, if ever it existed, had been perverted,&mdash;or
rather,&mdash;had been torn, rent asunder,
cast away! because my countrymen&mdash;as if fascinated
by the despot's crooked cipher&mdash;had in their
own hearts preferred implicit submission to the
restoration of an obliterated text, and, not content
with themselves going quietly to slaughter, when
I claimed their defence, only bade me do likewise,
that, no longer either benefited or bound by the
broken engagement, I left the community from
which I in vain expected support for that from
which I hoped for effectual protection,&mdash;until,
equally disgusted with the brutal stupidity of the
rulers, as with the servile apathy of the ruled, and
seeing in every system, whether of conquered or of
conquerors, equal disorganization and ruin, I at last
resolved to resume my rights of nature, and the primeval
state of warfare against all worth attacking!"</p>

<p>Here Spiridion looked, or pretended to look, as
if he thought he might be among those entitled to
that distinction, and would now gladly have rid
me of his company if he could. <i>That</i> being impossible,
he vouchsafed to answer me. "Men,"
he cried, "so violently enamoured of their natural
liberty, or rather license, should at once remove
themselves from the pale of civil society; nor
disturb those who are satisfied with what <i>they</i>
disapprove."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

<p>"Spiridion," I replied, "that is easily said; but
is it as easily done? Far as that society has spread
its insidious snares, has it so much as left a single
small spot on earth, where those yet unborn who
should dislike its partial regulations, may find room
to retire to the enjoyment of their birthright?
Or, if there be any such asylum remaining in the
wilds of Tartary or the wastes of America, has not
society, at any rate, so monopolized all the means
of disentangling oneself from its mazes, as to render
the gaining these blissful abodes next to impossible?
Must we not possess land caravans, or vessels,
licenses and passports, even to fly to the loneliness of
the desert, together with a strength of body and of
mind, of which the social institutions take care to
deprive us ere we suspect their dangerous power?
They cut our claws, they clip our wings, and then
they cry out with a smile of derision: "poor
pinioned eagle, fly if thou list!" The man who is
not wealthy can only escape from society through
the gates of death. Nor does he every where, I am
told, dare to approach even these boldly and honestly.
He must, in some countries, smuggle himself out of
the world by stealth, and embark for his journey
under false colours, lest his body be made accountable
for the roving disposition of his soul!"</p>

<p>In this sort of conversation did we while away
our time in the boat. I knew that some of my

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

arguments could not bear minute scrutiny; but I
felt less solicitous to seek the shortest road to truth,
as it must abridge our discussions, and leave us to
all the irksomeness of a passage, which grew more
tedious in proportion as our sentiments became less
discordant.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

<div class="center" id="v2ch10">

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a coasting voyage of three or four days,
some ominous appearances in the sky made us veer
about, and enter that most beautiful of harbours,
Port Calon&eacute;, on the island of Mitylene, where the
olive tree, growing almost out of the sea, again dips
its boughs in the tide which laves its roots. "Had it
not been written," exclaimed I, as we stepped ashore,
"that this brain of mine should be stewing under a
huge turban, instead of freely venting its superfluous
heat from under a slight skull-cap, what a fine
opportunity there would now be, midway as we are
between the three hundred rich friars of Nea-Moni,<sup id="r232"><a href="#n232">232</a></sup>
and the three thousand poor friars of Agios-Oros, to
turn thrifty myself, and exchange the thoughtless
prodigality of the sinner who stakes eternal happiness
against a few years of jollity, for the calculating
conduct of the saint who inflicts upon himself just
enough of privation and torture in this life, to purchase
a perpetuity of bliss hereafter;&mdash;or again, had
it been written that you should wear the turban as
well as myself, how profitably we might spend our
time in this boat slashing our arms and legs, in
order to mix our blood, and ever after to be bound

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

to each other both in body and soul, and sure of a
companion in hell as in heaven. But I wrap my
brains in muslin, and you in sheep-skin; and so
our souls must&mdash;whether they choose or not&mdash;after
their emancipation go miles asunder, and while
they remain in this earthly bondage we have nothing
to do&mdash;since we cannot pass our lives rowing through
the Archipelago&mdash;but to consider how we may dispose
of our persons to the best advantage, or at
least where we may convey them with the smallest
inconvenience."</p>

<p>"All this," said Spiridion, "I suppose you are
already fully determined upon, in your own mind."</p>

<p>"I am," was my reply,&mdash;"but still I want your
advice. You must know that in my humble opinion
this eternal Capitan-Pasha, whom I am for
ever talking of and waiting for, may be longer
going to his new harvest-field than my poor old
father to his last home; and therefore, as we are
approaching my native island, and the attraction
begins to operate, I should like, wind and weather
serving, with so many sins on my head and so many
enemies at my heels, to crave my sire's last forgiveness
and blessing. It would lighten my burthen,
and strengthen my soul, which sickens, and wants
such a cordial."</p>

<p>My motives for visiting the <i>fior di levante</i><sup id="r233"><a href="#n233">233</a></sup> silenced
all Spiridion's objections to going where he
himself still had so many connexions. We agreed

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

to cross the mountains which separated us from the
town of Mitylene, and there to hire a swifter vessel
for the remainder of our journey. Like Orestes I
was to wander about from place to place, trying
to expiate my guilt, while Spiridion&mdash;my Pylades,
had nothing to do but to watch me, in case I went
mad.</p>

<p>Arrived in the city and on the quay, the first
figure that struck me was a person&mdash;like myself
going to embark&mdash;of whose features my mind
seemed to retain a faint reminiscence. On closer
examination I found the gentleman to be an inhabitant
of my native town; upon which I accosted
him, and inquired the news of Chios. Eight or
nine years had altered my features considerably
more than his, of which the already long fixed
wrinkles had only acquired a little more depth and
sharpness. He therefore answered me as a stranger.
His account was not the less minute; but throughout
the whole narrative not a syllable was mentioned of
the only thing I cared about, namely, my own family,
which somehow I had expected would have figured
foremost. At last, losing all patience: "And
Dimitri Sotiri," said I, "what may he be doing at
this time?"</p>

<p>"You come from distant parts, sir," answered
the gentleman, smiling agreeably; "otherwise you
would know that signor Sotiri has been dead this
fortnight. I myself attended the funeral, and a

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

noble one it was;&mdash;more sweetmeats consumed than
at half a dozen weddings! But you turn pale, sir!
Is any thing the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," cried I,&mdash;trying to contain
myself,&mdash;"but a little giddiness to which I am subject;"&mdash;and
laying hold of a post for my support:&mdash;"who,"
resumed I, "carried the body?"</p>

<p>"His two sons, of course."</p>

<p>"There was a third."</p>

<p>"Ay, so there was;&mdash;and, though absent in person,
present enough in name. Sotiri talked of no
one else during his illness."</p>

<p>"What was it he said?"</p>

<p>"Why, faith! that is what nobody can tell.
Constantine and his brother maintained it was all
raving."</p>

<p>"Has that third brother been heard of?"</p>

<p>"Troth! people talk differently. Some say he
is a great man&mdash;a Bey of Egypt; others, a positive
beggar at Constantinople. An acquaintance of
mine, a man who seldom speaks any thing but the
truth, swears he met him the other day in one of
the streets of Galata, all in rags, and absolutely
begging charity. My friend was going to give it in
the shape of good advice, but the spark said that
was not what he wanted, and turned away. As to
his brothers, they report all that is bad of him.
Their father never could silence their tongues; and

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

though it is likely enough that all they say is true,
yet every body cries 'shame' to hear people talk in
that way of their own blood. It is what should be
left to strangers. With the mischief they have
made, it may be as much as his life is worth, for
signor Anastasius&mdash;or Selim, as they call him&mdash;to
show his face among us. The Turks' fingers itch
to throw the first stone at him, as much as those of
the Christians: although they say he is a hadjee,
and has been to Mekkah. But none need fear his
trying to come to Chios, I'll lay my life on it he is
dead long ago!"</p>

<p>"No," exclaimed I,&mdash;as if suddenly awaking
from a deep trance, and grasping the affrighted
talker by the wrist;&mdash;"he is not! and since you
are going to Chios, and may be glad to carry a piece
of news&mdash;tell them, Anastasius still lives; tell them
they soon shall see him; and tell them he comes
to resent his wrongs, and to claim his rightful property!"</p>

<p>Spiridion, alarmed at this sally, interrupted the
conversation. Taking the Chiote by the left hand,
while I still held him tight by the other, he pointed
to his boatmen, who were making signs of impatience
at his delay. Nothing he wished for so much
himself as to be gone. Disentangling his hands
hastily from our grasp, he gave us an awkward
half strangled salutation, and sped to his barge.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

<p>As soon as he was out of hearing: "Is this,"
said Spiridion, shaking his head, "the way in which
a son should mourn for his father?"</p>

<p>I could only stammer out: "my brothers, my
brothers!"&mdash;Spiridion let the first emotion pass;
and when he saw me more composed, spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>"I see, Anastasius, you still meditate some outrage;
of what nature I know not, nor wish to hear.
But of this I think it right to apprise you:&mdash;if, impressed
with a sense of all the forbearance you stand
in need of yourself, you show equal lenity to your
kindred; if, forgetting every injury, you only appear
among them to speak words of peace; if,
above all, you renounce every advantage bestowed
by the partial laws of Islamism, you have my friendship
for ever: I bind my fate to yours, until the
hour of death. But if, on the contrary, you only
return to your country to insult the ashes of your
father, to devour the little substance of your brothers,
and to justify the disgrace stamped in your birth-place
on your name, I stay here, I leave you to
run your race of shame alone, and I abandon for
ever all solicitude about your welfare!"</p>

<p>"Spiridion," answered I, "you know that covetousness
is not the vice of my heart; but do you
blame just resentment; do you wish calumny to
remain unpunished?"</p>

<p>"And are you then so irreproachable," asked the

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

son of Mavrocordato, "as to leave so much room
for injustice in the reports concerning you, and to
render every unfavourable representation of your
proceedings an unbearable calumny?&mdash;But be that
as it may; promise to do what I ask, or be content
to see me withdraw on the spot from the pain of
witnessing your future errors, and the disgrace of
sharing in your yet unborn crimes."</p>

<p>"I will not," replied I, "bind myself by a promise.
I should appear to have taken the engagement,
unmindful of its weight,&mdash;and only to fulfil
reluctantly an irksome task, because I had unguardedly
pledged my word to perform it. I wish
at least to acquire all the merit of acting right, by
retaining the power of acting wrong. Only go with
me as far as Chios. When there, should my behaviour
offend those whose notions of justice differ
from my own, it may not still be too late to leave
me."</p>

<p>"Then once more go we on!" cried my friend,
in a tone half confident, half fearful; "once more
be the day yours;&mdash;but beware!"</p>

<p>I now strewed ashes on my turban, took the gloss
of newness off my glittering vest, and put on the
signs of mourning. After this we engaged another
boat, and in a short time reached our destination.</p>

<p>There was no necessity in Chios to announce my
arrival. On my very first landing I found every
minor topic eclipsed by the more important subject

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

of my speedy coming. Already had my brothers
found means to stir up the whole town against the
renegade: already was every inhabitant up in arms,
to prevent him from reducing his nearest kindred
to beggary. So loud was the cry of defiance, that,
on stepping ashore, I found it expedient to go
straight to the mekkiem&eacute;. Safe in the hall of
justice, I had my brothers summoned.</p>

<p>Spiridion did not know what to think of my proceeding.
Questioned by his anxious looks, I made
signs for him to remain silent: but though he unclosed
not his lips, it was easy to see his heart trembled
between hope and fear.</p>

<p>For my part, without giving the least hint of
my intentions, without noticing the crowd collected
to survey my person and to watch my behaviour,
without satisfying the curiosity or correcting the
errors of the bystanders&mdash;who aloud, at my very
elbow, imparted to each other their surmises,&mdash;I
stood haughty, unmoved and silent, waiting the appearance
of my worthy pair of brothers.</p>

<p>At last they made their entrance; and never certainly
did men take less trouble to conceal the ill-humour
they felt at seeing an unexpected relation.
Without deigning to address me even in the words
of anger, they went and took their station on one
side of the hall, while I stood on the opposite side.
There&mdash;pale, sullen, dejected, and now and then
casting upon me a louring look of mingled rage

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

and despair&mdash;they awaited, without uttering a
word, the legal injunction to surrender the paternal
estate.</p>

<p>I own that for some time I enjoyed their dismay.
It was the only pleasure which they could afford
me. Having indulged in it till its zest evaporated,
I at last broke the long protracted general silence.
"My brothers," said I, "you are aware of my
claims upon you; and you likewise are conscious of
your conduct to me. In your own minds, therefore,
you dare not cherish the smallest particle of hope,
that I should surrender in your favour any portion
of my right. Yet what you dare not expect, I of
my own accord perform. I here publicly relinquish
my privilege. Take each your third of the paternal
property; and only leave me that portion which
would have belonged to me as a Christian, and which
I can but ill spare. That done, mourn for your
sins, and repent of your injustice."</p>

<p>To describe the effect which these words produced
on the audience would be impossible. Those who before
considered me as a devil incarnate, now of course
regarded me as an angel from heaven. The hall
resounded with loud applause. Nothing was heard
but praises of my generosity; and my brothers themselves,
stunned by so unexpected a turn in their
situation, were reluctantly forced to join in the
general cry. They thanked me, but in such a
way as made it doubtful whether they more rejoiced

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

at recovering their property, or more regretted
retracting their abuse.</p>

<p>I took no notice of their coolness, but, leaving
the mekkiem&eacute;, went straight to the paternal house.
My progress looked like a triumphal march: all
that had witnessed my behaviour in the hall of
justice, and all whom we met on the way, joined
the procession. Having reached the steps of the
mansion, I turned round and saluted the company.
In its turn the assembly honoured me with fresh
cheers, intermixed with a few observations on my
brothers, which at least showed that they were not
overlooked. I expressed my unmixed gratitude,
both in my own name and in theirs; and retired
to a private chamber, where I was glad to sit down
and rest my wearied mind.</p>

<p>While every one else had been loud in praise of
my conduct, the son of Mavrocordato alone had not
uttered a syllable. As soon as we were by ourselves,
he threw his arms round my neck, and attempted
to speak: but in vain! His emotion was too great
for utterance. He could only gaze on me with overflowing
eyes. To see his Anastasius, who thus far
had caused him nothing but anguish, had afforded
him no employment but to conceal his errors, all at
once become the theme of universal admiration; to
find his friendship thus justified, his perseverance
thus rewarded,&mdash;what a moment for his feelings!
Even while speechless for want of breath, his exulting

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

look seemed to say, "Well, my friend, are
you sorry or ashamed now that you followed my
advice?"</p>

<p>If, however, Spiridion's first thoughts were for
his friend, his second were for his father. Till that
moment, a more urgent subject of anxiety had occupied
his mind. This being set at rest, he took up
the other. "Ah, my tender parent," exclaimed he,
"why cannot you witness my success, or rather
your own! For I act in your name; I but accomplish
your vows. Alas! while I triumph, you still
remain in anguish. Yet shall you not suffer longer
than a grateful son can help."</p>

<p>Hereupon, he proposed to go out, and inquire for
the means of sending a letter. Already he had
despatched a few lines from Rodosto, to make his
father easy respecting his disappearance. On my
agreeing to the thing, we went forth. As we crossed
the esplanade of the castle, I perceived a dark cloud
gather on my friend's brow. His eyes seemed to
dart out of his head, and to remain riveted on the
quay. I turned mine the same way, but saw nothing
to account for Spiridion's perturbation. At
last, changing colour and pressing my arm: "we
are traced," he cried; "see Marco coming towards
us!" This person was his father's steward&mdash;an old
and confidential servant. "Let us go," rejoined he,
"and meet him. I have done nothing for which I
ought to blush."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

<p>Marco saw his young master advancing. He
pressed on his feeble steps, and with a respectful
salutation, presented a letter which he took out of
his bosom.</p>

<p>Spiridion, with a trembling hand, broke the seal,
and read: then paused, ruminated, and read all
over again. At last, trying to speak with more composure
than he felt; "your instructions, Marco,"
said he, "were to trace me, to follow me, and to
hand me this letter. Your commission is performed.
I have in a great measure answered my father, by
anticipation, from Rodosto: what remains, I shall
go and complete. I now am able to convey the
welcome information that the adopted brother whom
he committed to my care is become worthy of his
kindness, and, like me, only wants his prayers and
his blessings."</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Marco, in a firm but respectful
tone, "my instructions went further than you state.
I am bearer of letters to the despots,<sup id="r234"><a href="#n234">234</a></sup> the bishops,
and the pro&euml;stis of our different islands. They import
that I am to see you safe home. But even had
I not received express orders to that purpose, could
I find the courage to reappear before your worthy
parent, unaccompanied by the son for whom he
grieves? Ah, sir,&mdash;ah, my dear young master!&mdash;already,
from the anguish he has suffered, his precious
life hangs by a mere thread. Seeing me return
alone would certainly break his heart!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

<p>"Hark ye, Marco," replied Spiridion, pacing
backward and forward in an agitation which almost
bordered upon phrensy: "my father gave me a
charge which he cannot recall at will. It was witnessed
by heaven, and was recorded by angels! In
conformity with his solemn commands, and in compliance
with my sacred promise, I have toiled at my
task. God knows I have not spared myself. But
on the eve of completion, I cannot, must not, give
up my work unfinished. On my head would lie, to
the end of time, the sins of a brother unreclaimed.
If therefore you urge me no further, but quietly
return to Kandilly, I pledge my honour, nay, if you
wish it, I take a solemn oath, that all on my part
shall end to my father's ultimate satisfaction. If you
refuse me, the soul I stand accountable for shall not
be lost alone; two shall plunge together into ruin
everlasting. I run to the first mosque, and, whatever
be the consequence&mdash;may it fall upon your
head!"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Marco, "I grieve at this issue of
my commission; but the will of God be done!
Many years have I lived under your kind roof,
many an hour have I had you in my arms, as an
infant, as a child, as a boy. From the day on
which you first lisped the feelings of your affectionate
heart, to that on which you left your home,
never have I known your promise fail. The word
of Spiridion always was that of truth! I therefore

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

submit. I return alone; yet may I hope you will
deign to let me carry to your father a few lines of
comfort from your own beloved hands."</p>

<p>Spiridion, in running home to comply with the
request, only performed what he had already promised.
I, meanwhile, remained alone with Marco,
and availed myself of the opportunity to question
him respecting the reports of Kandilly. They were
more satisfactory than I could have hoped.</p>

<p>When, on the morning after my departure, the
son of the Capidjee was found, already taking his
last sleep in the proper place&mdash;the public cemetery,
no one suspected me of being the universal benefactor
who had introduced him to the silent, sedate
sort of company, in which he for the first time spent
the night: inasmuch as he was notorious for his
outrageous conduct, and, at the time I met him, had
several other quarrels on his hands, much more
public than the one for which he deservedly suffered;&mdash;but
every body agreed that whoever had
taken the trouble of ridding the neighbourhood of
the nuisance rather deserved thanks than blame.
As to my disappearance, a sufficient cause for it
was charitably found in the very natural wish of a
needy adventurer to fleece a wealthy heir.</p>

<p>These particulars left me an opening to return
to Constantinople, whenever I liked. I ran to relate
them to Spiridion, ere he concluded his letter;
and they relieved his mind completely. He pledged

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

himself soon to bring back to his father two sons
instead of one; and on this assurance, old Marco
took his leave. I proceeded to settle with my brothers
respecting the succession.</p>

<p>Had I quietly stepped into an undisputed property,
and found nothing to do but to mourn to
my heart's content for the loss of a parent, I would
have fulfilled with the utmost punctuality all the
observances of grief. Sadness really possessed my
soul, and I had constantly before my eyes my poor
father, in his illness wishing to see his Anastasius,
to forgive him, and to die in his arms&mdash;and perhaps,
in his last moments, and when I would have
gone to the world's end for his blessing, pierced to
the heart by exaggerated accounts of my unfeeling
and incorrigible profligacy. But, if mere business
accords but ill with sorrow, nothing is so sure to
drive melancholy away altogether as strife and bickerings;
and my brothers were much too considerate
not to afford me every distraction of this sort which
they could think of. Theirs was a malice which no
kindness of mine could assuage, nor no forgiveness
blunt; and the moment my formal renunciation of
their portions made them conceive all cause either
for hope or fear on my score at an end, their ill-concealed
hatred broke out again in all its pristine
virulence. They not only cavilled about every most
trifling article of the property, they even tried to
deprive of every degree of merit the act by which

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

it was restored to them:&mdash;they roundly asserted that
I had only been influenced by pusillanimity, and
had only sacrificed a part to make sure of the remainder.
Constantine was the Coryph&aelig;us in every
invective, as well as the leader in every altercation.
Eustathius, more indolent, contented himself with
giving his unlimited approbation to whatever his
brother (and that meant Constantine alone) thought
proper to do.</p>

<p>Thus were all the ancient wounds, inflicted upon
me in my former visit to Chios, afresh torn open,
and made to fester. Spiridion tried in vain to interpose.
He only got for his trouble taunts from
his antagonists, and reproaches from me. "Why
had he meddled at all;&mdash;why had he made it a point
with me to behave kindly to unnatural brothers,
whose injustice, but for his interference, would have
met with its deserts?"</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding my murmurings, did I
to a certain degree restrain myself; not from any
real moderation, but from the wish that my assumed
forbearance might encourage my adversaries to so
extreme a pitch of ill conduct, as to render its provocations
evident to all the world, and to justify
any step prompted by my legitimate resentment.
Nor did this period seem far distant. Whether
from an idea that they had daunted me by their
haughty tone, or from an absolute intoxication of
brutality, they by degrees cast away all pretensions

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

to decency. The more I forced myself to appear
calm and composed, the more they increased in the
grossness of their insults.</p>

<p>All wondered at my patience; all beheld me with
admiration. When my brothers allowed themselves
every license of language&mdash;almost every latitude of
gesture&mdash;all stared to see me content myself with
turning up my eyes to heaven like a saint cast
among savages. Even those least acquainted with
my irascible temper, cited me on this occasion as a
perfect model of meekness and forbearance. He
alone who with unwearied vigilance watched each
change of my countenance, and could penetrate
each emotion of my heart, was not to be deceived.
One day, when Constantine even exceeded his usual
insolence, and I, my customary forbearance, I caught
him expressing, by an almost imperceptible shake
of the head, his distrust of my tranquillity. His
suspicions were spoken too intelligibly for me to
pass over. "What do you fear?" cried I, as
soon as my brothers were out of hearing. "Do
you not see me laugh at their meanness?" "Ah!"
replied Spiridion, fetching a deep sigh: "you
may laugh with your lips; but laughter reaches
not your eyes, and fell resentment rankles in your
heart."</p>

<p>My friend was right. Suppressed anger had
already curdled my blood, and clogged the whole
circulation of my humours. Ere yet he had done

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

speaking, a sudden shivering rushed through my
frame, my teeth began to chatter, and my limbs to
shake. In an instant all my strength seemed to
forsake me.</p>

<p>Since my sojourn at Chios, I had resumed my
old travelling custom of carrying my pistols, duly
loaded, in my belt. Many in Turkey always wear
them thus, when out of the capital. As they now
impeded my breathing, I took them out, and laid
them on the sofa. Scarce was I disencumbered of
my weapons, when my knees began to tremble; a
dark curtain seemed to drop over my eyes&mdash;and I
fell senseless on the couch.</p>

<p>I continued some time bereft of all perception.
On its return I found myself stretched out at full
length where I had fallen, with all the accompaniments
of one duly convicted of a decided and
lasting illness. A regular physician of the place
was feeling my pulse, and going to pronounce on
my case; and as my first return to my senses was
marked by a fierce struggle with my &AElig;sculapius,
I was at once judged to be in a violent delirium,
and in imminent danger. Sentence was pronounced
accordingly, and every internal medicine and every
external application prescribed, which could torture
the human body and stomach. All the bystanders
conceived me to be in the agonies of death, and
civilly expressed their regret, at the short stay I
made among them.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

<p>To myself these politenesses seemed premature.
The sudden transitions from heat to cold, the suppressed
perspiration, the fatigue of body and the
anxiety of mind during the journey, were quite
sufficient, in my own opinion, to bring on a strong
paroxysm of fever, without death being the necessary
consequence. I however deemed it expedient
to assent to all the doctor said, in order that he
might say no more. It afforded Spiridion an excuse
for turning out the company, and procuring
me a little quiet. He alone stayed to nurse me.</p>

<p>"What a pity," muttered I to myself, when I
thought no one heard me, "that that last dose
of the English powders of mine should have been
wasted in Egypt on that traitor my father-in-law!"
Spiridion lost not a syllable of the soliloquy. "There
are foreign vessels in the harbour," he cried:&mdash;"possibly
they may have some;" and he immediately
ran out to inquire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my brothers had received from the
visitors departed the agreeable intelligence of my
being at the last gasp. They hastened up to me
eager with curiosity and hope; and finding my
door ajar and unguarded, slipped in with the least
possible noise. I however had discerned their steps
on the stairs, and immediately&mdash;before they entered
the room&mdash;assumed the appearance of one in the
act of resigning his last breath. Constantine was
the first to approach. On tiptoe he came to my

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

bedside, in order to ascertain whether his joy was
well founded, ere he gave it full scope. With that
laudable view he examined me most minutely from
head to foot, raised and let fall my arms and legs,
moved his hand before my eyes, put his ear to my
mouth, first addressed me in a low whisper, then
audibly, then shouting with all his might, as if he
suspected I might not be in earnest.</p>

<p>Most manfully did I stand the whole ordeal.
Nothing could make me wince or move a muscle;
and my affectionate brother at last acquired the
grateful conviction, that, if not quite dead yet, I
had at least already lost all perception, and could
not fail soon to depart for ever. He no longer
delayed conveying the agreeable intelligence to the
discreet Eustathius, who, the hindmost on all other
occasions, on this also had not ventured beyond
the door, and there stood, in breathless expectation,
waiting the result of the scrutiny; and perhaps
also watching the condition of the outposts.</p>

<p>"Stathi," said Constantine, with a sort of subdued
exultation; "there is some warmth still about
him,&mdash;but depend upon it he cannot last!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the wary Stathi, shaking his
head, "worse than he, I fear, have recovered!" and
he fetched a deep sigh at the thought!</p>

<p>"True," answered Constantine; "and as we are
alone, and have every presumption in our favour,
why not make sure work, and crush the snake at

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

once!" And so saying, he laid his hands on my
throat, and attempted to strangle me.</p>

<p>This was doing things in a grand style! Not
stopping at half measures. I conceived for my
brother a veneration unfelt before; almost thought
it a pity to interrupt him in his spirited proceeding,
and would have let the farce go on, could I, at its
conclusion, have revived at my own pleasure. <i>That</i>
not being the case, I was reluctantly forced to notice
the intended favour, and, weak as I felt, to defend
myself as well as I could against my two stout assailants;
for Stathi too had now advanced to lend a
hand: and it was evident, that having once begun,
they would not, if they could any way help it, leave
their noble work unfinished.</p>

<p>My fire-arms lay concealed, but within reach.
With one hand I seized Constantine's wrist, and
with the other a pistol: "Ah brother! ah fiend!"
I cried,&mdash;and fired.</p>

<p>Never yet had I missed my aim, even when I
held not my prey in my grasp. But at my first
sign of life Constantine had started, and, content to
leave his jubbee in my possession, had disengaged
his person. My hand, besides, trembled with the
effects of the fever,&mdash;perhaps even with some instinctive
sense of the dire office it was performing,
and&mdash;the miscreant only received the ball in his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Uttering a dreadful yell, he made a spring at the

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

door, and darted out. Ere I could find my other
pistol, Eustathius too had made good his retreat.
Both were out of sight in an instant, but not out of
hearing. My ears bore witness to Stathi's tumbling
down stairs with such violence and outcry, as
to make me entertain hopes that neither of them
had entirely escaped the merited retribution.</p>

<p>As soon as, after a few dying murmurs, all was
again hushed in silence,&mdash;"now," thought I, "for
the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Spiridion! According to custom,
he will lay the whole blame on me. He will deem my
good brothers' intentions all very wise and proper;
will see much sound reason in them, and will not be
content, I suppose, until I go to them with a halter
round my neck, beg pardon for my impatience in
stopping their proceedings, and humbly supplicate
them to put their design into execution!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the report of the pistols had a second
time collected the whole neighbourhood round my
door. But, if pronounced delirious before, I now
was supposed to be under the influence of a phrensy
so outrageous, that no one durst step across my
threshold. The curious contented themselves with
forming a blockade outside the room, each holding
himself in readiness to fall back, and to shove his
neighbour in his place, should I make an unexpected
sally.</p>

<p>This state of things continued till Spiridion's
return. His expedition had been unsuccessful.

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

When he appeared, so many officious friends sprung
forward to explain what had happened in his absence,
that it would have been utterly impossible for him to
understand a single word of the matter, supposing
even that the relaters themselves had known the truth.
But my brothers, to whom they were indebted for
all their information, had, in their hurry, dropped
the trifling circumstance of their attempt upon my
life, in which the affair began. Despairing, therefore,
to make any thing of the confused and contradictory
accounts with which he was stunned, Spiridion
at last pushed aside the crowd, and, to the
utter astonishment of all&mdash;entered my room undaunted
and alone!</p>

<p>He found me seated on the sofa, with my face in
my hands, and my elbows on my knees, overwhelmed
more with disappointment than with
shame, and incapable either of raising my eyes or
unclosing my lips. Thus I remained wholly unmindful
of his entrance, until, after contemplating
me some time in silent earnestness, he at last took a
seat beside me, and spoke.</p>

<p>"Selim," said he, "am I to believe these people?
Are you really out of your mind; or are you rather,
as I apprehend, perfectly in your senses?"</p>

<p>"In my perfect senses," answered I with all the
composure of which I was master.&mdash;"My hand
was raised to punish demons. This time they have
escaped:&mdash;but what is not yet, may be!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

<p>"Never, never," cried he, "while I have life.&mdash;Rather
than that you should hurt your brothers,
my breast shall interpose."</p>

<p>"Then through your breast," I exclaimed,
"must I strike them."</p>

<p>Spiridion here rose. "Anastasius," said he,
calmly, "I feel but little wish to live: not however
at thy hands must I receive my death-blow!
My bosom may be pierced by thy speech, but let it
remain sacred from thy sword. The world must
not have it to say that thou couldst plunge thy
dagger into the heart of thy friend. The crime
would be as idle as it would appear heinous. If
my presence be a burthen to thee, say but the word,
and I go."</p>

<p>"I never desired you to stay," cried I, in a sullen
tone.</p>

<p>"Very well," rejoined Spiridion. "You speak
plain. Yet, ere I act accordingly, once more, and
for the last time, I appeal from Anastasius blinded
by passion to Anastasius restored to his reason. In
an hour hence I return and repeat the same question.
If the answer be the same,&mdash;then farewell, and for
ever!"</p>

<p>At these words Spiridion went out, and tranquillised
the gentlemen drawn up in the passage, with
respect to my situation. On my friend's assurances
they all rushed in, and teased me with so many
questions, and with so much advice, that they almost

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

made me lose the little wits I had left. Their annoyance
still lasted, when, at the expiration of the
hour, Spiridion returned. Without seeking it, he
had gained so universal a sway by his dignified demeanour,
that at his desire all retired. The room
being cleared of strangers, he took me by the hand,
and finding that the symptoms of bodily disorder
had subsided, he looked sternly in my face, and
spoke thus.</p>

<p>"This, Anastasius, is at last the moment which
must decide my resolution. The solemn vow is
irrevocably spoken; and, according to what you
now answer, I may stay, or I must leave you for
ever. Do you swear by all that is holy to renounce
your impious revenge, or do you prefer to be released
from my society?&mdash;If the last, utter not, I
beseech you, the ungracious word. Only withdraw
your hand."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly this would have been the moment
thoroughly to explain the nature of the recent conflict
with my brothers, of which my friend knew
but half, and of which that half more than doubled
my guilt. Not aware that my own life had been
attempted first, and ignorant that I acted in my
own defence, Spiridion considered my illness as a
pretence, or, at any rate, my firing as a premeditated
scheme. It would have been easy to have removed
his error.&mdash;Had not my bare word sufficed, Constantine's
torn garment would have borne witness to the

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

struggle. But after my solemn promise at Mitylene,
I considered the bare suspicion as so injurious
to my honour, that my offended pride forbade my
undeceiving my friend, or clearing my character.
I pulled away my hand, and Spiridion walked out.&mdash;Yet
God knows that I did not wish to lose
him!</p>

<p>As soon as he had left me, I paced up and down
the room with a hurried step. After a few turns I
went out to fetch breath on the quay. An hour's
air and exercise changed the current of my ideas.
I felt regret for my obstinacy, and fear of its consequences.
With the utmost speed I ran home,
and up to Spiridion's chamber.</p>

<p>He was closing his portmanteau. The things
about the floor had disappeared. All looked empty,
orderly, and desolate.</p>

<p>"What means this?" cried I, affecting more
surprise than I felt.</p>

<p>"Only," replied Spiridion, "that what I said,
I do."</p>

<p>"Ah my friend, my real brother," exclaimed I,
"do you then, in sad earnest, purpose to leave me?
Cursed be my tongue, which uttered what my heart
had no share in; and cursed be my hand, which
confirmed the untruths of my tongue!"</p>

<p>"Anastasius," now said Spiridion, seating himself
upon his little bundle, "fancy not your last
words and actions to have been the sole and primary

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

cause of a long formed, and long resisted, resolution.
Its origin dates far higher. The unkind
speeches and gestures of this day only gave the final
impulse.</p>

<p>"From children we were brothers in love. When
you rescued me from death, the day that all our
companions stood palsied by fear, gratitude only
riveted affection's prior links,&mdash;and duty, I hoped,
had rendered them indissoluble, when my father
himself named you his second son. Many years his
commands of fraternal kindness to his Spiridion's
preserver remained without fruit,&mdash;you yourself
best know how. Yet was the deep-rooted attachment
of childhood never replaced by more recent
friendships; and when I again beheld you at Constantinople,
my feelings for my Anastasius still preserved
all their freshness unfaded. Evil inclinations
of no ordinary magnitude, indeed, I saw mixed with
your better qualities: but I thought that, if freed
from their alloy, your virtue too would eclipse ordinary
virtue; and I imagined that an unbounded
devotion might enable me to become the instrument
of so noble a reformation. I undertook the task. I
resolved to save from perdition your soul, as you
had saved my body; and I prayed the Almighty
to bless the undertaking. Some return on myself
also, some selfish feelings, perhaps, were mixed
with my wishes for your welfare. I could not help
fancying that, regenerated through me, you would

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

become my support and my consolation in the irksome
race I am destined to run; that in your turn,
you might assist me in the struggles and dangers
that strew the rugged path, through which I am destined
to journey to my fate. In short, I hoped that,
each blessed in the other, we should toil through
life together; and that, when shone forth our last
day, whichever of us was summoned the first, should
only die in the other's loved arms. Great as were
the pains you took to expose my presumption and
to dispel my foolish dream&mdash;long did my soul firmly
cling to its fond chimera; long did my heart hug
its foolish vision, as a thing too substantial and too
precious to part with!</p>

<p>"But there are lights that even strike the blind.
Reluctantly, though irresistibly, I have at last been
forced to see that no arguments, no persuasion, no
labour of mine have power to control the passions
which enslave you; and that, however I may strive,
I still must leave you ungovernable, and you still
must leave me wretched as before. Much as I tried
to avert my eyes from the fatal truth, I have at last
yielded to the painful conviction that, sooner or
later, we still must be separated for ever; and that,
by trying to put off the evil day, by struggling for
a short and transient respite, I can only at last
drink the parting cup with greater bitterness. I
therefore submit to the decrees of Heaven: I bow
to the will of Providence in flying from thee, as I

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

erst hoped to fulfil its behests by following thy footsteps.
In sadness I go; but I go, and for ever!
Far from thee I henceforth shall live; and far from
thee it will be my fate to die! Yet, Selim, thou art
young still. What the anxious warnings of friendship
could not perform, the leaden hand of time
may achieve. It may allay the ferment of thy passions,
clear away the impurities of thy heart, and,&mdash;though
I shall not witness the blissful change&mdash;still
make thee great and virtuous. This happy
consummation God in his goodness grant!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Spiridion," cried I, clasping my friend in
my arms, "you cannot, you shall not leave me
thus!" But he&mdash;fearing his own weakness,&mdash;in
order to render a relapse impossible, "On my head
be God's eternal curse, be that of my aged father!"
cried he, "if I do not immediately return to my
paternal roof!"</p>

<p>I now felt all remonstrance to be fruitless. "You
are right," replied I. "The game could not go
on between us. The stakes were not even. Loaded
with the gifts of Providence, and accountable to
your fellow creatures for their use, you may not
squander your ample means on a barren soil, nor
seek ruin with a reprobate whom you cannot save.
Yet, if once Anastasius did possess your love, and
still returns all your affection; if that wretch, that
reprobate, in the midst of all his errors never ceased
to reverence your virtues; if his spirit, undaunted

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

by all else, stooped to you, and worshipped you
alone,&mdash;oh Spiridion, listen! At present when, bereft
of all hope, indeed weaned of all wish, to hear a
sentence repealed on which depends your peace, he
for ever renounces the happiness of your society, nay,
urges you himself to fly his baneful presence, at least
grant this last and only request; grant what he,
who never yet humbled himself before mortal man,
implores of you on his bended knee: tell him&mdash;lay
this unction to his sickening soul to know&mdash;that you
do not hold him in utter detestation; that on leaving
him to return no more, you at least feel a pang:
and when&mdash;all earthly things gone by like unsubstantial
shadows&mdash;comes the day of your reward in
heaven for the good deeds done on this earth; when,
before the throne of Mercy, arrayed in all your
worth, you receive your well-earned meed of ineffable
joy, cast back one look of pity on the wretch
who, overwhelmed by the weight of his guilt, sinks
irretrievably while you rise to glory. Speak for
him to your Maker one poor word of intercession:
and supplicate that he may not fall so low in the
abyss of wretchedness, but that from an immeasurable
distance he still may behold, and be consoled
by your bliss!"</p>

<p>"Here or hereafter," cried Spiridion, "if I forget
you, may Heaven forsake me!"&mdash;and bending down
his head, he wept aloud.</p>

<p>After some time he rose up, and wiping away his

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

tears: "I have," said he, "signed an engagement
to endure throughout eternity:&mdash;now, in your turn,
make me a promise to hold good only for a short
space of time."</p>

<p>"Any promise you please," I answered.</p>

<p>"What a temptation that!" rejoined my friend.&mdash;"But
I shall not abuse your confidence. I shall
not ask what you cannot perform. It was only a
trifling favour which I wanted for the mutual mitigation
of pain. Take this watch," he added, giving
me the one he wore; "and count just twenty minutes
ere you stir from this spot."&mdash;Saying which,
he took up his parcel, and walked to the door. I
tried to remonstrate and to stop him; but, gently
pushing me aside: "you have promised," he cried,
and instantly disappeared.</p>

<p>I ran after my friend as far as my pledged honour
would permit&mdash;to the threshold of my room, and
there called him back with loud and repeated cries:
but in vain! Spell-bound by my promise, I stood
motionless on the utmost verge of my apartment,
with ears stretched out to catch each fleeting sound,
and eyes riveted on the hands of my watch. At
first I perceived some commotion, some distant bustle
in the house, some running backward and forward;
but very soon all these noises sunk away in a dreary
and lasting silence. Yet were there several long
minutes wanting of the point marked on the inexorable
dial for my release. Each of these appeared

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

an entire age, composed of many lesser periods of
endless duration, and all the time I kept my eyes
straining on the figures, as if my bare look could
quicken by its motion the impulse of the hands. At
last they approached the goal, glided over the last
second, and attained the long wished-for term!&mdash;I
now dart forward like an arrow: I run, I leap, I
fly; first, through the house, from room to room;
next&mdash;on finding all deserted within&mdash;out into the
street, and lastly to the quay.</p>

<p>There I perceive nothing but an indifferent and
gaping crowd, which my eyes in vain interrogate,
and which gives me no satisfactory answer. Wherever
I look, no Spiridion appears!</p>

<p>Fearfully I at last cast my eye on the wave; and,
after an anxious search among the shipping in the
road, spy, already far away, a small ca&iuml;ck, which,
with stress of sails and oars, seems steering towards
Tchesm&eacute;. A young man, I was told, for whom the
ca&iuml;ck lay waiting, had been seen to step in, with
his face wrapped in his shawl; and immediately the
boat was pushed off, and cleft the billows with such
speed, as already to appear little more than a mere
speck.</p>

<p>The young man was Spiridion,&mdash;and my first impulse,
to go after him. I called for another barge;
but while it was preparing, soberer thoughts drove
away my first design.</p>

<p>Why in fact follow a friend determined to fly

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

from me!&mdash;Was not his purpose irrevocably fixed?
Went he not back to his father and his home?
Was he not right in doing so? Did not the happiness
of his life depend upon this measure? was I
to impede his progress, or to increase his parting
pangs, and that from a mere selfish feeling? For
what now could he gain, by aught that I could say
or do?</p>

<p>Immediately I gave up the short-lived project,
and having paid for the trouble I occasioned, walked
away, and sought on the beach a more retired spot,
in which to vent my sorrows. Distracted by so
many opposite feelings that I scarce seemed to feel
at all, I threw myself on the ground, and moistened
with my tears the sand on which I lay. "All
now," cried I, "is to me at an end; my abode is
become a desert, my life a scene of solitude, my
very existence a blot in the creation!"&mdash;and hereupon
I struck my breast, until, exhausted by my
grief, I grew somewhat more quiet, and began my
song of sorrow.</p>

<p>In the midst of my melancholy ditty I remembered
that, together with his watch, Spiridion had
slipped into my hands a pocket-book, which, not
knowing what to do with, I had thrust into my
bosom. I now pulled out the toy. It might contain
some farewell token,&mdash;some last and sacred
behest.</p>

<p>A few words had indeed been written on one of

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

the leaves, but had been rubbed out again. The
only uncancelled document I could find, and to
which the case seemed intended as a vehicle, was a
loose slip of paper, an order to the bearer&mdash;but to
what amount I know not: for, without looking at
the figures, I tore the draft to pieces, and scattered
the useless fragments in the wind. No sooner
however had I done so, than I regretted my precipitation.
The sum was nothing! I never meant
to claim it; but the last signature of my friend in
my behalf,&mdash;what to me could be equally precious?
As of many other things, however, of that also I
first felt the value when too late! Already had the
surf washed away the last remnant of the paper.</p>

<p>I now pressed to my lips the empty book. "Last
remembrance," exclaimed I, "of a friend for ever
lost, be thou my sole unceasing companion. Lie ever
next my heart. Continue its &aelig;gis against all evil
passions. Preserve me henceforth, not from grief,
but from sin!"</p>

<p>This said, I started up, and left the lonely spot:
but as I returned among the bustling throng, my
sadness increased. Why did I tarry any longer in
my native land? How could I face my countrymen,
abandoned as I was by my friend? "Ah!"
cried I, "since I have him no more to guide and to
support me, let me fly from Chios, as from the place
of my shame. Let me seek refuge in Egypt, at
Algiers, in France&mdash;or wherever else men acquire

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

fame by destroying each other! There let me forget
the silenced voice of friendship, in the savage cry of
war and the shout of defiance; there pass my days
in strife, there conquer, or there die!"</p>

<p>Conformably to this resolution, I determined not
to stay for the completion of the settlement with
which had commenced my worst misfortune, but
left my full powers with a friend, or in other words,
sold my birth-right to a schemer, for an immediate
sum. The same act rid me of my troubles, and
began those of my brothers:&mdash;a circumstance which
they probably only learnt after my departure, as
in consequence of their ill-fated attempt both kept
their beds; not entirely from choice, however,&mdash;Constantine
having got a broken arm in the conflict,
and Eustathius a dislocated hip. These were
the only incidents which soothed my disappointment.</p>

<p>As for me, I took my passage to Cyprus, where
I thought I might join the Turkish fleet in its way
to Egypt; and, in the act of embarking, called down
upon my head the utmost wrath of heaven, if ever
I set foot in my native land again.</p>

<p>Spiridion, by the way of Smyrna, speedily reached
his home, and his father's longing arms. Whether
from fatigue or from mere disappointment, he fell
into a state of languor, which long threatened a
fatal termination. But time and corporeal debility
at last blunted the sting of mental suffering. Insensibly
health returned, and with health a calm

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

hilarity. The youth then resumed, never more to
abandon it, the regular mode of life which only for
my sake had been interrupted. In good time he
married a young lady of noble blood and distinguished
beauty, and became the happy father
of a lovely family.</p>

<p>Mavrocordato, as observed before, had destined
his son to run the perilous race of ambition; and,
had he never known what it was to fear the loss of
that darling son, would with difficulty have been
diverted from his vain-glorious purpose. But while
Spiridion's fate hung suspended between life and
death, his father too strongly felt the blessing of his
existence and the value of his happiness, any longer
to stake them against perilous honours, difficult to attain,
and unsubstantial when possessed. His desires
became sobered, and his views less aspiring: he
determined to prefer the certainty of his son's bliss,
to the probable misery of his grandeur; and vowed,
so Heaven but left him his child, never more to abuse
a father's authority, by goading him on to dangerous
distinctions. Mavrocordato thus forfeited, indeed,
the advantage of boasting, like the Giccas, the Callimackis
and others, that their nearest of kin had
been bowstringed on a throne;&mdash;but this misfortune
he bore with becoming resignation. As to Spiridion,
content to move in the sphere of a wealthy
merchant, he employed his daily growing riches
in diffusing around him happiness and prosperity.

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

His life resembled the course of a majestic stream,
whose deep but tranquil waters, winding their ample
way through fertile plains and flowery meads, as
they advance still receive from new rills fresh increase,
while at each step also they bestow more
profusely all the fruits of industry, and all the blessings
of plenty.</p>

<p>Far different was the similitude borne by my roving
existence. Seeking my fortune in strife, not in
harmony; making havock, not culture, the means
of my support; and engaged, not in the steady
pursuit of a regular profession, but in a wild wandering
flight from one career to another; sometimes
prosperous, and oftener unfortunate; now
in unavailing plenty, and now again in pinching
want, I at best resembled the blustering mountain
torrent, which, only acquiring might and substance
during the war of the elements, as soon as their
contest ends, again subsides in a mean rill; in
times of serenity shows no trace of its passage, save
in the havock of darker days brought to light; and
so far from diffusing in its fulness more benefits
than in its penury, only effects greater mischief as it
receives ampler supplies. While still near its source
in the upper regions of the globe, this ill-favoured
offspring of the clouds&mdash;hurried over fell and precipice&mdash;only
presents a succession of fierce struggles,
furious falls and impracticable shallows; when further
advanced in its impetuous career, and rushing

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

with tremendous roar into the fertile plain below,
it seems indeed determined to seek a full recompense
for all former restraints;&mdash;it disregards all
rights, destroys all property, and levelling fence
and boundary, annihilates crops, habitations, and
life: but, throughout the whole of its wild uncertain
progress, from where it first bubbles up near the
sky, to where it finally plunges into the vast abyss
of the deep, it equally remains a curse to the regions
it pervades!</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> paroxysm of fever which seized me at Chios
had, in the hurry of the strange and multifarious
events to which it gave rise, been entirely forgotten.
I was therefore surprised when, on board the ship,
a second more violent attack came on; and was still
more mortified when it appeared that, so far from
being allowed to drop the acquaintance, I had
thenceforth to consider the unwelcome intruder as
my regular guest. Its visits were repeated with
most irksome punctuality, every third day, during
the whole of the passage; and this passage seemed
to have no end.</p>

<p>Oh! how long appeared those sleepless nights,
in which I felt no change of motion in the ship, but
what was caused by its rolling from side to side, or
pitching from end to end: in which every object
suspended round my narrow berth&mdash;my clothes, my
lamp, my person, and the very shadow they cast on
the wainscot&mdash;never ceased exhibiting the same
monotonous see-saw motion, which found its equally
monotonous response in the periodical creaking of
the hulk, straining of the mast, swaying of the yards,
and flapping of the sails and tackle. How slowly
approached those mornings which were neither

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

announced by the crowing of the cock, nor hailed
by the twittering of the swallow; and whose dead
and universal silence was only broken by our own
harsh discord, added to that of the howling winds
and roaring waves! How often I anxiously looked
out at my narrow loop-hole, to see whether the stars
had yet lost their quivering radiance, and whether
the horizon yet reddened with the approaching
dawn! My mind suffered with my body; and,
during those tedious hours, the depression of disease
made me survey with deep contrition the errors of
days past, and form sincere resolutions for my future
life. They lasted with unremitting continuance&mdash;until
health and strength returned.</p>

<p>This happened at Cyprus. That island which
gives agues to so many, cured my tertian completely;
or perhaps only transferred it to some other luckless
wight, most opportunely in the way to catch the
disorder, on its getting tired of its former incumbent.
I was however only just convalescent, and had scarce
left my bed, when, from the heights above Larneca,
Hassan's armament was descried five or six leagues
out at sea, in full sail for Egypt. That fleet which
I had so long expected now cleft the wave almost
under my eyes, without its proximity enabling me
to join the nearest vessel of the squadron.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had another string to my bow:&mdash;but
ere I proceed to tell by which way I returned
to the land of the mamlukes, I must premise a few

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

words concerning what happened there after my
departure.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, I think, that in Aly-Bey's
time an alliance had been proposed between
Petersburg and Cairo. This project the Autocratrix
of all the Russias failed not to resume, as soon
as she saw Ibrahim and Mourad in firm possession
of the supreme authority. Her wish was to obtain
from the Beys the port of Alexandria; an object of
the greatest importance to her future maritime operations
against the Turks. In return, she offered to
afford these turbulent leaders every assistance in
shaking off the yoke of the Sultan; and the Russian
Consul-general at Alexandria, Thonus by name, was
entrusted with the negotiation. He had the facility
of corresponding with the rulers of Cairo through the
medium of a personage, once a Russian subject, but
then a renegade, a mamluke, and a Bey, under
the appellation of Khassim. On the other hand
he found indissolubly united against him the Consuls
of the other European powers in Egypt, who,
whether friendly to the Porte or not, were all alike
hostile to the plan of giving up to the Russians so
important a harbour as Alexandria. Thonus undertook
to defeat their opposition by the simple expedient
of removing their persons. A petty quarrel
had arisen between Mourad and the commercial
diplomatists, respecting some trifling repairs to the
Latin hospice at Alexandria. This slight spark of

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

misunderstanding the crafty Livonian contrived to
fan into so furious a blaze, that the Consuls no
longer thought themselves safe on land, and determined
to take refuge at sea. Their intention was
to sail in a body to Constantinople; and this design,
sedulously fostered by Thonus&mdash;who suffered not
the fears of his friends to relax&mdash;would soon have
been fulfilled to that gentleman's utmost wish, had
not Ibrahim, alarmed at the consequences of the
dispute, sent a messenger to efface by his concessions
the outrages of his colleague. Already were the
Consuls on board, and in the act of weighing anchor,
when, stopped by this trusty agent, the exulting
Thonus had the mortification to see them return on
shore, and resume their situations.</p>

<p>Ibrahim's conciliatory measures, however, came
too late to prevent the interference of the Porte.
On the first blush of the business, the Consuls, apprehensive
of violence on the part of the Beys, had
despatched an express to Constantinople, to lay their
complaints before the Sultan; and Abd-ool-Hameed
had determined to resent the insult offered by the
rulers of Egypt to the strangers under his special
protection, in an exemplary manner. Had it suited
the convenience of the Porte to remain at peace with
its vassals, the representatives of all the potentates
of Europe, flogged round Mourad's hall, would
have obtained no other redress than an exhortation

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

to mutual forgiveness of injuries; but the Divan
wished to humble the rebellious Beys, and it therefore
expressed the utmost readiness to resent their
behaviour to the high offended personages. In vain
did these worthy individuals themselves, as soon as
they no longer entertained any apprehension for the
safety of their persons, try to undo what they had
done, and to prevent a rupture injurious to their
interests. In vain did they write to assure the
ministers that they had been premature in their
fright, and had forgiven their enemies, like true
Christians as they were:&mdash;Hassan Capitan-Pasha,
who was a Turk, and moreover had never yet found,
in his varied expeditions, an opportunity of exploring
the fertile plains of Egypt, expected too plentiful
a harvest, if not of laurels, at least of piastres
from this business, to let the quarrel be hushed up;
and, under Abd-ool-Hameed, the wishes of this
favourite were law. The Divan, therefore, in answer
to the pacific protestations of the consuls, only observed
that they were much too lenient, that the
offence could not be overlooked, and that they must
have satisfaction whether they chose or not; and
hereupon proclaimed the Beys outlaws; and ordered
an armament to be fitted out against them.</p>

<p>A show of negotiation had, however, been kept up,
and had to a certain degree succeeded in lulling
asleep the apprehensions of the mamlukes, when, on

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

the sixth of July 1786, the squadron which I had
beheld with longing eyes from the coast of Cyprus
appeared before Alexandria. It consisted of six
ships of the line, four frigates, some gun-boats, and
forty or fifty kirlangitsches, and other small craft
capable of going up the river to Cairo. These
vessels carried six hundred chosen Arnaoots from
the interior of Epirus, as brave as well armed, and
about five thousand raw recruits from every corner
of the Archipelago, possessed of neither arms,
courage nor discipline. To this small force the
Grand-Admiral added at Alexandria about three
thousand Maugarbees, or Barbaresques, very lightly
equipped. Of cavalry, the species of troops most
wanted against the mamlukes, Hassan's armament
was entirely destitute; but the Asiatic Pashas of
Oorfa, of Haleb, of Trabloos, and others, had been
ordered to bring with all expedition from their respective
governments more horse than were wanted,
to Belbe&iuml;s, near the Syrian confines of Egypt, there
to wait the Grand- Admiral's further orders.</p>

<p>These orders were indeed despatched the day that
the commander in chief reached Rosetta: but their
execution experienced some difficulty, inasmuch as
the Pasha of Oorfa was not yet arrived at the
place of rendezvous, and as all the others had, immediately
after Hassan's departure from Constantinople,
been entirely countermanded. The ministers

<!-- vol 2 page 236 -->

were in daily expectation of a war in the north,
and felt unwilling to waste all their resources in the
south.</p>

<p>Hassan, thus disappointed, resolved to compensate
for want of numbers by celerity of movements,
and began to ascend the Nile on the last day of July.
The land troops marched along the banks of the
river, while the flotilla of gun-boats advanced by
their side on the stream.</p>

<p>When the intelligence of the Capitan-Pasha's
operations reached Cairo, the greatest unanimity
took place among the Beys as to their sense of danger,
but the greatest diversity of opinions as to the
mode of repelling it. Ibrahim was for submission,
Mourad for resistance; and no medium being hit
upon between these two extremes, the former retired
into the Sa&iuml;d to avoid the imputation of rebellion,
while the latter marched into Lower Egypt to
oppose force by force.</p>

<p>The fourth day of August witnessed the meeting
of the two armies near Mentoobes. Mourad with
his well-mounted mamlukes, all mail without, and
all ardour within, felt secure of an easy victory over
the Grand- Admiral's ill equipped foot soldiers. He
had neither taken into his account the artillery by
which they were flanked on the stream, nor the
swamps he must wade through, to attack them on
its banks. Received, on his first onset, with a tremendous

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

discharge of cannon from the boats, his
troops were immediately thrown into confusion.
Even the safety of flight was denied them. Sinking,
with the weight of their accoutrements, up to
their horses' bellies into the rice grounds that formed
the field of battle, they became motionless, and were
slaughtered at pleasure by Hassan's naked infantry,
which might have walked on the wind. The few
mamlukes that escaped, immediately fell back upon
Cairo; but, finding the gates of the citadel shut
against them by the Sultan's Visier, they only traversed
the city, and joined Ibrahim in Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>Hassan entered without further opposition the
defenceless capital, and received the homage of the
country. He took up his abode in Ibrahim's palace
at Kasr-el-a&iuml;ni, and conferred on the long-exiled
Isma&iuml;l, arrived from the Sa&iuml;d to meet him, his long
vacated office of Schaich-el-belled. Djeddawee's
more dubious loyalty was less splendidly rewarded;
and Yeyen-Visier, the obsequious tool of every
party in power, was dismissed from his place: it
was reserved for the expected conductor of the
Asiatic troops.</p>

<p>This personage, Abdi by name, had been Pasha
of Haleb. Turned out of that city by its jenissaries&mdash;jealous
of his Koordish body-guard<sup id="r235"><a href="#n235">235</a></sup>&mdash;he
had just been consoled for his loss by the government
of Oorfa, when he received orders to march

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

with all the force he could collect from Diarbekeer
to Egypt. As nothing had been said about provisions,
he resolved to trust for his supplies to the
plunder of the districts through which he had to
pass; and, as he only had to traverse Syria from
end to end, in its greatest length, he only contrived
to spend, for want of subsistence, the whole summer
on his march.</p>

<p>Nothing could have happened more conveniently
for a man who, like me, wished to go from Cyprus
to Egypt. It afforded the readiest means of making
up for the loss of my passage on board the fleet
on my right, by joining the army advancing on
my left. A boat conveyed me from Larneca to
Trabloos; and thence forward I found the track
of Abdi's troops too distinctly marked by their
devastations to miss the way. I could however
only overtake the Pasha near Nabloos in Palestine,
where I reached him in the best possible disposition
for glory; that is to say&mdash;not valuing life a straw.
Had I been inclined to fastidiousness, I might have
found some fault with the appearance of my competitors
for warlike fame. They pursued its career
unincumbered by superfluities. The best equipped
among the Pasha's troops were his own body-guard
of Koordish horse, who under the denomination of
dellis<sup id="r236"><a href="#n236">236</a></sup> still exercised their old trade of banditti,
and plundered every friend on their march to the

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

enemy. To this body of about eight hundred men
was added another of about six hundred Spahees, in
very indifferent condition. The infantry was composed
of about five hundred Maugarbees, who
looked as if they could be led to victory by nothing
but famine. In fact, this ravenous horde only
resembled a swarm of locusts, who suddenly appear
in a region as if driven by an evil wind, fall on
whatever spot offers the most abundant harvest,
devour all its crops, and, when they find nothing
further to consume, rise again, only to lay waste the
fields next in succession. As long as there remained
in a place a single article to take away or to devour,
the Pasha thought not of stirring. The complete
denudation of all around him became the signal
for departure; but the tents were again pitched in
whatever nearest district admitted of the same proceeding.
The march was lengthened only when
such deserts intervened as offered neither provision
nor plunder. Every where, before the approaching
army, the inhabitants abandoned their villages,
carrying with them all that was moveable to the
mountains; so that every new region we came to
looked as if we had been there already, and left us
no means of marking our route but by the destruction
of the fixtures; and, from the elongated shape of
Syria, and the direction of the march, no district
escaped the devastating scourge.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

<p>Besides the general claim which my former rank
in Egypt gave me to the attention of a commander
in the pay of the Porte, I carried particular letters
to Abdi from the governor of Larneca. Accordingly,
I was promised the reversion of whatever
eligible appointment might become vacant, and,
meanwhile, stepped into the place of a captain of
dellis, most fortunately killed the very morning of
my arrival, by some peasants, in an ambush.</p>

<p>On calling over the muster-roll of my corps, I
found not a single bairak<sup id="r237"><a href="#n237">237</a></sup> possessed of half its
complement of men. Each was a grand skeleton
composed of lesser skeletons; and never did troops,
at the opening of a campaign, more strikingly resemble
soldiers returning from the wars. This remark,
however, I kept to myself. As a new comer,
I took it for granted that my predecessor knew what
he was about (except indeed when he got killed;)
and resolved not to begin by breaking through
established customs. Quietly therefore pocketing
the surplus pay, and selling the supernumerary
rations, I gained the love and esteem of all my
fellow-officers. We agreed that Hassan would not
give us more fighting than was necessary, and it
would be wrong to tempt him to imprudences by
too martial an appearance. The only thing I took
care of was to be well mounted myself. But the
horses and accoutrements which I purchased having

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

drained me of most of my remaining cash, I was
obliged to draw for my other expenses on the
present holder of my kiasheflik,&mdash;whoever that
might be.</p>

<p>At Gaza we made our scanty provisions for the
great desert. Very ample ones were left in it for
the vultures. Belbe&iuml;s saw us arrive at last, not in
May indeed, but in September; and from that
place of general rendezvous, where not a soul met
us, we marched on to Cairo.</p>

<p>It was here that an edifying scene of mutual
astonishment took place, in Hassan, at the smallness
of our force, and in us, at the absolute nothingness
of his. In fact, we had never had many more
troops, while he had disbanded half the men which
he brought, to pocket their pay.</p>

<p>Nothing could equal the change of scene which
Cairo presented from what I had known it before,
I had left it a mamluke city; I found it a Turkish
camp. Every object indicated a change of masters
and of regulations. Turkish detachments patrolled
the streets, Turkish piquets occupied the places;
and those porticoes of the grandees' palaces which
formerly witnessed the mamlukes driving away
with their naboods the famished Egyptians, now
saw the Osmanlees treat the mamlukes with scarce
more respect. My friend Aly-tchawoosh, whom
I had the pleasure of finding with the Capitan-Pasha&mdash;but
somewhat impaired in flesh, in spirits,

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

in brilliancy, and in boastfulness&mdash;took me to the
house where I was billeted. "What?" cried I,
on seeing it; "am I to lodge with my old acquaintance
Sidi-Emin, who used to rail so loudly against
usury, and, when a friend wanted money, would
oblige him by buying his old slippers at fifty sequins
down, so he only consented, in return, to buy
Emin's new ones at five hundred, payable in three
months!&mdash;I shall be glad to shake hands with the
worthy man." "Ah!" cried Aly, "you will only
shake hands with his ghost. But that you may
make sure of. It stalks all night about its old
mansion."</p>

<p>And good reason it had for being disturbed. The
reader may remember the dreadful famine which
I left hanging over Egypt. Emin, on this occasion,
was one of the provident. During the years
of plenty he had laid by for those of want. But,
like the ant, he laboured for himself, and cared
not to share his savings with the idle. Though
his granaries could scarcely hold all his corn, he
saw unmoved the thousands of wretches who every
day perished with hunger under their very walls.
When the bodies of the sufferers choked up the
entrances of his store-houses, he still refused to unbar
their surly gates, until grain had reached the
exorbitant price fixed by his avarice. This it at
last attained;&mdash;and now, exulting at the thoughts
of the millions he should make in a few hours,

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

Emin took his keys, and opened his vaults. But
O horror, O dismay! Instead of the mountains of
golden wheat which he had accumulated, he only
beheld heaps of nauseous rottenness. An avenging
worm had penetrated into the abodes fortified
against famished man! A grub had fattened on the
food withheld from the starving wretch! While the
clamour of despair resounded without, a loathsome
insect had in silence achieved within the work of
justice. It had wrought Emin's punishment in
darkness, while his crimes shone in the light of
heaven. The miser's wealth was destroyed, the
monster's hopes were all blasted! At the dire spectacle
he uttered not a word. He only for a few
minutes contemplated the infected mass with the
fixed eye of despair; then fell,&mdash;fell flat on his face
upon the putrid heap. God had smitten him!
On raising his prostrate body, life had fled. Like
his corn, his frame was become a mass of corruption!</p>

<p>I had the pleasure to find Mavroyeni's former
place of drogueman of the fleet occupied by his
nephew Stephan. This youth's character presented
a singularity among Greeks in public situations,
wondered at by all, and disapproved of by most:&mdash;he
was a perfectly honest man. His enemies
rejoiced at it, though his friends still kept hoping
that he was not too old to mend. Meanwhile the
acquaintance, begun between us in the Morea,
ripened at Cairo into a real mutual regard. I say

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

mutual&mdash;for though Stephan did not always think
well of my conduct, he valued my sincerity.</p>

<p>The strongest proof of attachment, however,
which I received in Egypt, was from my quondam
mamlukes, whom I had ceded to Isma&iuml;l at Es-souan,
and now found established with the reinstated
Schaich-el-belled in the capital. At the time of
my flight they seemed perfectly satisfied with the
transfer; and indeed, had they now thought it
incumbent upon them to leave the Schaich-el-belled
and to return to their old patron, they must have
been great losers by the change. But so excessive
became, on seeing me again, their generous wrath
at thinking I had renounced their services, that
they could not even bear to remember that they
once had belonged to me.</p>

<p>As to the Capitan-Pasha himself, his memory
was more retentive. He not only recollected having
seen me in the Morea; he even remembered the
proposal he made me after the affair of Tripolizza.
When again presented to him: "you would have
acted more wisely," said he, "to have embraced
the true faith for the sake of a patron, than for the
love of a mistress; and perhaps you might have
found the service of the Sultan more profitable than
that of the Beys. You have lost much time, and
gained few friends. But you are young still, and
what is more, you are brave: if you would not let
me lay the foundation of your fortune, I still

<!-- vol 2 page 245 -->

may raise the fabric by a few additional stories."
And so saying, he recommended me to his kehaya;
who grinned a ghastly smile of obedience and of
spite.</p>

<p>The government of Egypt being completely
organised by the installation of Abdi Pasha in the
office of Visier, and all the forces having arrived
that could be looked for, Hassan at last began to
busy himself about the long talked of expedition to
Upper Egypt, in pursuit of the rebels. Resolved
himself not to stir from his commodious quarters,
he gave the supreme command to his kehaya. The
troops destined for the expedition were to rendezvous
at Atter-el-nebbi, a place on the Nile, half a
league above Cairo. As before, the land force was
to follow the banks of the river, and to be supported
by the flotilla. Hassan's favour enabled me to
exchange my ragged Koords for a fine body of
Arnaoots; and in honour of my new soldiers I
furbished up my old Epirote pedigree, and my
presumptive descent from Achilles and from Alexander.
The former indeed they knew little about,
but the latter all seemed acquainted with; and only
maintained, in opposition to my doctrine, that he had
fought the Doge of Venice&mdash;which, in fact, he had.<sup id="r238"><a href="#n238">238</a></sup>
Including the militia of the country, supplied by the
citadel of Cairo, our force might amount to six
thousand men; and I could not help thinking that
Hassan rather over-rated our chance of success,

<!-- vol 2 page 246 -->

when at parting he recommended to us, in a speech
full of pathos, to bring back the days when the
Schaich-el-belled held the stirrup to the Aga of the
jenissaries, and when, in return, the Pasha of the
Porte hung up the Beys under the gate of the castle;&mdash;a
wish at which Isma&iuml;l, now surnamed kbir, or
the great, Aly-Bey-defterdar, Mohammed-Bey-mabdool,
Rodoan Bey the bold, and several other
Beys present, I thought, winced a little.</p>

<p>As usual, our army depended for its subsistence
on the plunder of the provinces through which we
had to pass. This circumstance would alone have
retarded our coming up with Mourad; but what
still more increased the difficulty of closing with this
chief, was his own good management. He had profited
by his discomfiture in the Delta. Instead of
advancing to give us battle, he this time, on the contrary,
kept constantly retreating before us; only
now and then just letting his rear appear in sight, to
keep up the ardour of the pursuit. We discovered
his drift&mdash;somewhat late however&mdash;when at Sioot
we found the waters too low to permit the further
progress of our flotilla, and thus were obliged to
proceed, deprived of the support of our floating
battery. With a diminished strength we only
reached the rebels at Djirdg&eacute;, where they had all
the advantage of the ground. Their position was
admirable. Backed by the walls and garrison of the
city, they had in front a long declivity of hard even

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

ground, where their excellent horses and impenetrable
coats of mail gave them as great an advantage, as
they had caused them a disadvantage in the swamps
of the Delta. They rushed upon us like a torrent,
and it soon became evident on which side the scale
would turn. Our rout began with the Asiatics. The
brave Arnaoots alone kept for a time the victory in
suspense. Unable, however, entirely to dismiss all
anxiety for the character of my former troops, the
dellis, I set some Epirotes at their heels, and thus
got them wedged in between two fires. This concern
for the credit of others cost me dear. A pistol-shot
struck my hip, which certainly came not from
the enemy. It brought me not the less to the ground;
and I must have died from loss of blood, or have
been trampled under foot, had not by good fortune
one of my trusty Albanians thought me dead already.
He judged it a pity that my handsome armour should
become the spoil of rebels, and approached to strip
me; when, to his great dismay, he found me still
alive. For a second or two he seemed to hesitate
whether he should not realize his surmise; but my
good stars prevailed. Shrugging up his shoulders,
as if to say, "it was not his fault," he took me in
his arms, carried me off the field, bound up my
wounds, and left me in the care of two of his comrades,
themselves disabled from continuing to support a
more active part in the engagement.</p>

<p>Meantime our commander, seeing the rout become

<!-- vol 2 page 248 -->

general, sounded the retreat. Fortunately
the enemy had determined only to act on the
defensive, in order not to cut off all opening to a
reconciliation. Thanks to Mourad's moderation,
we experienced no annoyance in our flight except
from the fellahs, whose crops we had destroyed in
our progress. At Sioot we rejoined our flotilla;
and thence returned to Cairo in a plight, which
even those among the mamlukes that had been reinstated
by Hassan could view without breaking
their hearts. The assistance of a rival is seldom
forgiven.</p>

<p>After a certain period Mourad's Arab allies, tired
of the protracted war, as usual withdrew from the
contest; and Mourad, deprived of half his strength,
no longer appeared averse to a negotiation. Of
this disposition Hassan availed himself to draw him
down to Djizeh, when he again sent his kehaya in
pursuit of the Bey. Cured of my wound, I joined
the expedition, and on the eighth of January 1787,
we crossed the Nile. The flotilla was on this occasion
out of the question&mdash;the river being at its
lowest, and the commander of the gun-boats dismissed,
for an offence which Hassan seldom forgave
in his officers; namely, robbing without his participation.</p>

<p>At the news of our approach, Mourad again fell
back; but we came up with him at Sioot, where he
was forced to halt, to face about, and to receive us.

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

His position was exactly the reverse of that which
he had held at Djirdg&eacute;. Instead of occupying the
top of a long declivity, of which we filled the bottom,
his army was drawn out at the bottom of an extended
slope, of which we occupied the summit; and instead
of having immediately in his rear a high wall
to cover his movements, he only had a deep ditch
to cut off his retreat. The consequence was, that
when we fell upon him as he had before done upon
us, with all the impetus of a downhill charge, we
almost immediately drove his troops backward into
the fosse, where, tumbling head over heels in the
mud, they left us no trouble but that of despatching
them at our leisure.</p>

<p>Of my old patron, who sided with the rebels,
I hitherto have made no mention. The edge of
the ravine, down whose slope the mamlukes were
sliding with different degrees of speed, gave me
the first glimpse of his venerable figure. He was
curveting mid-way the long descent, surrounded
by his retinue. The sight roused all my dormant
feelings of relationship, and others not less warm;
and I became most irresistibly anxious to join
my father-in-law, to lock him in my arms, nay,
to keep entire possession of his valuable person.
Calling to my best men, I showed them the Bey,
and proposed a bold push for so important a prize.
They fired at the thoughts, and off we set! I
was within ten yards of his person, and already

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

in imagination hugging him most fervently, when
some of his guards, perceiving our drift, gave
the alarm. Immediately his whole house closed
in upon him, and our purpose miscarried. I retired
not, however, empty handed. We had penetrated
so far into the mamluke knot, that I
was enabled to seize by the arm and to carry off,
what at the time was nearest Suleiman's heart,
his tootoondjee.<sup id="r239"><a href="#n239">239</a></sup> This young fellow I consigned
to some of my servants in the rear, and having
seen him safe in their custody, again returned to
business.</p>

<p>The chase of a young mamluke, whose showy
accoutrements caught my eye, had inadvertently
drawn me out to some distance from my men,
when another mamluke of more advanced age and
greater powers&mdash;till then concealed behind a small
eminence&mdash;suddenly darted forward between us.
The contest now lay with the new comer, and his
agility already rendered the issue somewhat doubtful.
But when a third mamluke of colossal size&mdash;a
kiashef of my ancient patron's&mdash;found means by
a dexterous circuit to join his comrade, my situation
seemed indeed become desperate. It was plain that
a scheme had been concerted to entrap me;&mdash;and,
unable single-handed to contend with two such formidable
antagonists, whom others were still approaching,
I gave myself up for lost, and only resolved
to sell my life as dear as possible.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

<p>To my inexpressible surprise, just as I rushed
forward&mdash;to certain death as I thought&mdash;the new
comer made a signal for a truce, which his comrade
immediately obeying, I failed not to do the same.
I stopped short like my antagonists, still however
remaining on my guard, and watching every motion
of the two mamlukes, in order to make my escape,
should an opportunity offer. The kiashef perceived
my apprehensions. "Fear not," he cried: "your
life is indeed in our hands; but we seek not your
death; we want only your prisoner. Restore Suleiman's
tootoondjee, and in return take this handjar
studded with diamonds, this order on the Bey's
harem at Cairo for two thousand sequins, and this
signet of our patron's to corroborate his draft."</p>

<p>All this was vastly better than to be butchered at
Sioot: I accepted the offer. Meantime some of my
Arnaoots, who had perceived my danger, were coming
up. I cried to them, as soon as within hearing, to
fetch back the prisoner. One went on the errand,
and the others waited at my signal. The tootoondjee
was delivered over, and the ransom placed
in my hands. With this rich spoil, the thing which
I feared most was to return to my own men. Fortunately
they were full-handed themselves, and I
rejoined our troops safe and sound&mdash;just in time
to see the remnant of the enemy's force, which had
escaped the ditch, in full flight towards the Sa&iuml;d.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

<p>Our men were so exhausted, that we spent the
night where we had won the day. The next morning,
ere we marched, I walked over the field of
battle. Beholding on all sides sturdy limbs locked
in death, which but the day before had turned
my blows with all the energies of life; lips closed
in eternal silence, which had stunned me with
their clamour; and eyeballs fixed in sightless glare,
which, when met by mine, had sent forth flashes of
lightning:&mdash;unable to avoid treading upon the
mangled bodies of some who often had attempted
to crush me with their very look, and now could
not keep away the already busy vultures&mdash;I felt a
strange delight! I contemplated with a bitter satisfaction
that unavoidable lot of all mankind, that
doom of mortality remitted to none, that precariousness
of life shared alike by king and beggar,
thanks to which, if I could not be sure of a single
instant before me, no more was the proudest of
my antagonists certain of not being the next moment
a clod of clay, a mass of corruption, a feast
for worms; thanks to which, if any rival obtained
over me a temporary advantage, it was, however
important, a trifle, an atom, a nothing, in the contemplation
of the common fate awaiting all that
breathe, and awaiting all too soon; and thanks to
which, finally, if I could not reach the very top of
fortune's wheel, or for the present carry my head

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

quite as high as some of my more successful opponents,
I knew that theirs must ultimately lie as low,
and be as little regarded as mine!</p>

<p>"Poor speechless ghastly object!" cried I, lifting
up by the ears one whose taunting language
had but the day before still tortured my own;
"thou art now not only below me&mdash;below the
meanest of my slaves; thou art worse in estate
than the live dog that licks my hand, or the very
worm that hies to feast on thyself; he harbours joy,
thou feelest not even my abuse and my scorn!"</p>

<p>Though we did not absolutely stay in the agreeable
spot which occasioned these reflections, we
seemed loth for a time to move beyond its influence.
Want of money to pay his troops prevented our
commander from proceeding in good earnest, in
pursuit of the rebels, until the month of May. We
then made a sudden advance; but as soon as we
came in sight of Mourad's men, they crossed the
river, and retreated into Nubia. Arrived at the
Cataracts, heat, want, and disease stopped our further
progress. We admired the falls, wheeled about,
and marched back to Cairo.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this time Hassan had, through penalties, confiscations,
and other such lucrative processes, reaped
all the real fruits he expected from his expedition.
He knew the utter impossibility of exterminating a
set of men who always kept open a retreat where
they were secure from pursuit; and he now made
the approaching rupture between the Porte and
Russia a pretence for conveying his armament back
to Constantinople. On the twenty-fourth of July,
1787, therefore, he signed a treaty with the rebel
Beys, by which he left them in full possession of
the country from Barbieh to the frontiers of Nubia.
All below these limits was to be prohibited ground.
For the observance of this treaty his opponents consented
to give as hostages four of their party&mdash;my
old friend Ayoob-Bey, Osman-Bey-tamboordgi,
and two other Beys of recent creation, Abderahman
and Husse&iuml;n. These important mamlukes had
leave, however, to remain at Cairo, under the eyes
of the Visier.</p>

<p>The quartetto soon arrived, and I failed not to
call upon Ayoob. He had strongly reprobated at

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

the time Suleiman's conduct in giving me up, and
assured me he wondered not to see a man of my
mettle, after such treatment, return to Egypt in so
different a character. I was glad in my turn to
find an opportunity of doing a chief, who formerly
had distinguished me in a most flattering manner,
a very signal piece of service. Some expressions,
dropped by the Capitan-Pasha, had made me surmise
that foul play was intended to the hostage
Beys. I need not say by what means I verified
my suspicion; but I forthwith went and apprized
Ayoob of his danger. His gratitude for this friendly
act led him to offer me a handsome present, which
I declined.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hassan had got every thing in readiness
for his departure. He confirmed Abdi-Pasha
in his place of Visier, and Isma&iuml;l Bey in his rank
as Schaich-el-belled. On his kehaya, whose name
likewise was Isma&iuml;l, he conferred the situation of
his wekil, or agent at Cairo. After these, and other
appointments, he assembled in the citadel a solemn
Divan; gave, in a set speech, a pompous detail of
the incalculable benefits he had bestowed on Egypt;
and terminated the sitting by inviting the four
hostage Beys, against the faith of treaties, to follow
him to Constantinople. Osman, Abderahman, and
Hussein, taken by surprise, were obliged to accept
his proffered hospitality. Ayoob, put upon his
guard by me, had taken his precautions, and prepared
his chief mamlukes. The summons had

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

scarce dropped from Hassan's lips, ere he rushed
out, and, assisted by his suite, sought refuge in
Ibrahim's harem. Hassan durst not, in defiance of
his own solemn promise, drag the most respected
among the beys in disgrace from so revered a sanctuary.
He was left at Cairo in the enjoyment at
least of his outward honours.</p>

<p>Those which Hassan offered to my choice were,
to remain in the citadel of Cairo, commander of the
local Arnaoots, or to go back to Constantinople,
and obtain promotion in the expected war. Admiring
neither the Visier, the Schaich-el-belled, nor
the wekil, and wishing much to try Valachia and
to rejoin Mavroyeni, I accepted the latter. The
ransom of Suleiman's tootoondjee, duly paid on
presenting his order; the well lined belt of a mamluke
whom I had disrobed at Sioot, and the liquidation
of certain old claims at Cairo, which I employed
those ready accountants my Albanians to
settle, had gone a good way towards repairing my
shattered finances. The last evening of my stay at
Cairo added another figure to the balance of my
capital. As I passed through a narrow lane, an
ill-looking fellow suddenly stopped me, and drew
out a dagger. I started back: but instead of the
point he turned to me the hilt, left the handjar in
my hands, and disappeared. The weapon was
covered with emeralds, and of considerable value.
I had seen it before, on grand occasions, sparkle in
Ayoob's girdle.&mdash;Hassan never saw it in mine.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 257 -->

<p>Nothing remarkable occurred on the journey
down the Nile. On the 21st of October we weighed
anchor from Alexandria. Our voyage was prosperous,
our reception at Constantinople indifferent.
The mob of the capital, it seems, had promised
itself the agreeable spectacle of the heads of the
Egyptian Beys stuck on the battlements of the
Bab-humayoon, and cared little to see us only bring
back our own. To ourselves, however, this was a
source of some satisfaction; and the more, as we
brought, besides, wherewithal to fortify our minds
against idle clamour.</p>

<p>Even after Spiridion and I had parted for ever,
my friend had not dismissed all solicitude in my
behalf. Fearing lest the obscurity which hung over
Achmet's death might not always succeed in preventing
its baneful influence over my fate, in case
of my return to Stambool, he had, during my campaign
in Egypt, negotiated with the family of the
deceased a legal renunciation of its vindictive rights.
At first indeed his proposal greatly shocked the
mourning parents. "What! sell the life of a relation,
of a son, for money!&mdash;No, never!"&mdash;Were the
earth to swallow them up on the spot, they must,
they would have blood for blood!&mdash;At any rate,
they could only compound with the executioner's
axe on the culprit's neck! By degrees, however,
they came round to more reasonable sentiments.
The event was nearly forgotten, the loss small, the

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

chance of discovering the offender still less, and the
sum offered considerable. With many ifs, and buts,
they at last signed so formal an act of forgiveness,
that I might, if I liked, have added to my other
titles that of slayer of Kara Achmet.</p>

<p>I needed not this new proof of kindness, to feel
ill at ease till I had embraced my friend. Fearful
however of taking him by surprise, perhaps at an
unseasonable moment, I sent to inquire whether my
visit would be acceptable. The precaution proved
a wise one. Just then was pending the negotiation
with the lady, who soon after bestowed upon Spiridion
her fair and faithful hand. Her parents only
objected his former intimacy with a notorious profligate
and a renegado. Had I shown myself at that
juncture, and taken advantage of Spiridion's friendship
to appear in his company, the match would
have been broken off. It was even requisite, I understood,
for the advancement of the business, that
the coolness grown between us should be openly
expressed. A hint of this circumstance having been
given me, I acted accordingly, and complained aloud
and in bitter terms of Spiridion's leaving me at
Chios; but privately I sent him, as a token of
friendship, a fine Arabian, accompanied by a few
lines of affection and of thanks. Unavowed proceedings
always turn out ill, however well meant!
Whether the messenger thought the horse would
betray the giver, or whether the horse ran away with

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

the messenger, neither they nor the letter reached
their destination; and, long after, I heard that
Spiridion had felt hurt at my seeming neglect.</p>

<p>Returning one day from witnessing&mdash;with infinite
satisfaction&mdash;to what degree the Franks, who accuse
the Greeks of meanness, can excel them in that useful
quality; how they can humble themselves, even
in the persons of the representatives of their sovereigns,
before the paltriest of the Sultan's officers;
and how at their public audiences these pliant envoys
of European powers will put up with any indignity
from the lowest Turkish rabble, for the sake
of maintaining an intercourse with a nation which
returns their advances with contempt,&mdash;I happened
to meet a face no longer young, which put me in
mind of an old vow, not the less sacred from the
lowly station of its object. It was that made to the
little grocer's wife, who in the days of my first distress
had come to my relief with conserve of roses.
In her own later career&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;bitters had
succeeded sweets. The new French style of cookery,
and the white sauces introduced with the revolutionary
principles among the Greeks of fashion,
had exploded the spice and comfits, staple ingredients
of the darker complexioned dishes, the delight
of their forefathers. The grocer consequently
was become a bankrupt, had died of grief in the
midst of his unsold dainties, and had left his consort
to struggle with misfortunes, which required a

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

species of consolation more solid and less sentimental
than that which I once administered to
a mourning widow in Egypt. I should not have
mentioned the visit which I paid for this purpose,
and the real pleasure I derived from the relief I was
able to afford, but that my friends, justly solicitous
about my unsullied fame, might remark that I had
at an early period of my history recorded a solemn
engagement, and nowhere had mentioned its fulfilment.</p>

<p>Let us return to matters of more importance.
Though from the first instant of his elevation,
Youssoof-Visier had been preparing underhand the
rupture with Russia, the war broke out without any
formal declaration. On the 18th of August, 1787,
the Russian ambassador found himself unexpectedly
complimented with a lodging at the Sultan's expense
in the Seven Towers,<sup id="r240"><a href="#n240">240</a></sup> and the Turkish troops stationed
at Ockzakow made an attack upon the fortress
of Kinburn, when the garrison thought itself in
profound peace. The fullest success of these petty
man&oelig;uvres could not have made amends for the
imputation of bad faith which they fixed upon the
Turks; their failure only added disgrace to discomfiture.
They gave the Emperor of Austria a
plausible excuse for joining the Russians, and for
declaring war against the Porte, on the 9th February,
1788. This event seemed to mark Valachia
for the seat of the ensuing campaign. It increased

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

my wish to take a share in its hazards; and I obtained
from Hassan-Pasha letters both for Youssoof
and for Mavroyeni. Encamped at Daood-Pasha,
the supreme Visier had already hoisted the standard
of the Prophet, and was collecting round the sacred
staff the grand army of the faithful, for the defence
of the empire. I intended to visit the Commander
in chief on my way, but aware of my moderate
dimensions, and expecting to make a greater figure
on the smaller theatre of Valachia, I purposed to
tarry only with Mavroyeni.</p>

<p>Neither personage, however, was to be favoured
with my company the very instant my credentials
were signed: such unnecessary diligence would have
bespoken an anxiety in their behalf somewhat too
flattering. With my letters in my pocket, I gave
three days more to the dissipation of the capital;
and, satisfied with having, through dint of unexampled
diligence, compassed as much pleasure as
so short a period would allow, proceeded without
further delay on the less perilous road to open and
avowed warfare. My equipage was light. It consisted
of what articles my own horse could carry in
addition to my person; for, unable to afford a long
string of attendants, I trusted more for safety to a
perfectly unobtrusive appearance, than to a small
and insufficient retinue.</p>

<p>Though I had seen camps before, that of the

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

Visier-Azem, with all its want of order, struck me
as very magnificent. The central object, the tent
of the commander&mdash;with its avenues of pillars and
standards, its gilding and its draperies&mdash;looked a
most imposing mass: but its tenant disappointed me.
I had formerly known Youssoof as Hassan's kehaya.
He was then quoted for the erect majesty of his
mien, and for the jetty lustre of his ample beard.
The personage to whom I was introduced at Daood-Pasha,
on the contrary, had the grey hairs of age
and the stoop of infirmity. "Heavens!" thought I,
"can this be the same man whom I formerly admired?
can seven years so pull down the sturdiest
human frame? would they make so woful a ruin of
this body of mine?"&mdash;And it was a relief to my mind
when I heard that Youssoof, in order to increase the
gravity of his appearance, used arts for the purpose
of looking old and infirm, similar to those which
others employ for that of appearing young and
active.</p>

<p>With the other attributes of age, Youssoof
seemed to have acquired its garrulity. I thought
there never would have been an end to his inquiries
after Hassan-Pasha. The Grand-Admiral's health,
his looks, his spirits, were each separately made the
theme of long and repeated expressions of solicitude:
and at each favourable reply, Youssoof blessed
Allah for the good news with such studied emphasis,

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

that I judged the Visier's affection for his
ancient patron, and the Capitan-Pasha's regard for
his overgrown favourite, to have sunk nearly to the
same level. Base coin is always showy!</p>

<p>As soon as Youssoof had added his contribution
to my letters for Mavroyeni, I proceeded on my
journey. The supreme Visier himself was soon to
break up his first station, and to halt successively at
divers other marked places, in order to give the
Za&iuml;ms and Timariotes of all the different provinces
of Roumili an opportunity of reinforcing his army:
and I was unwilling, by unnecessary delay, to encounter
on the road more than I could help of
the small detachments of true believers, expected
soon to obey from all quarters the invitation of
Mohammed's vicar!<sup id="r241"><a href="#n241">241</a></sup></p>

<p>From Daood-Pasha I met nothing in a questionable
shape until I reached Erekli. There appearances
became more terrific. On going out at
the gate of that city after dusk, and turning the
corner of the spacious burying-ground which extends
close under its walls, my horse suddenly stopped,
and in defiance of whip and stirrup, stood
staring at the tombs, trembling like a leaf. "So!"
thought I, "the Gouls are abroad; the spirits of
the dead hold their revels; the living are unwelcome
here!" And in fact, I soon perceived, by the light
of the moon, a number of gigantic shadows glide

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

along the marble gravestones. The spectres that
cast them seemed to be dancing hand in hand
round the cemetery; sometimes separating, then
again forming clusters, then totally disappearing
under ground. Presently sounds too arose from
the earth: confused murmurs pervaded the place;
and at last a whole swarm of ghastly figures sprung
up close to my horse,&mdash;no longer indeed unsubstantial
phantoms, but seeming, from their emaciated
form and pallid hue, the very corpses of the dead
arisen from their coffins. Immediately they encircled
me with hideous yell.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, was the frightful ring completed,
than my apprehensions of the deceased vanished
in my fears of the living; and I no longer
thought myself in the company of spectres, but in
that of banditti. Accordingly, clapping both stirrups
to my horse, I was going to break through the
threatening circle, when I perceived that none of
the party were armed, or at least had any weapon
more formidable than a stick, or a pair of crutches;
that there were as many women and children in the
ranks as men; and that more than two thirds of
the troop were halt, blind, or paralytic.</p>

<p>There is, gentle reader, a district in the Morea,
whose inhabitants are, to a man, beggars by profession.
Every year, as soon as they have sown their
fields, these industrious members of society abandon

<!-- vol 2 page 265 -->

their villages till harvest time, and sally forth, on
a mendicant circuit, through the different provinces
of Roumili. The elders and chiefs of the community
plan the route, divide the provinces, and allot to
each detachment its ground. They shorten or prolong
their sojourn in the different places, according
as the mine of charity is rich, and has been more or
less explored. Through wastes where little is to
be gleaned, large troops travel in close order; but,
on approaching fruitful districts, the swarms again
divide and spread. According to his peculiar talent,
each individual undertakes the heart-rending tale of
mental woe, or the disgusting display of bodily suffering.
"His wife and children died of hunger by
the road side, after having been burnt out of house
and home;"&mdash;or, "he has an incurable leprosy in
every joint;"&mdash;or, "he is actually giving up the
ghost for want of a morsel of food!" Old traders,
grown rich by their indigence, sell out to young
beginners; and the children of the society remain
in common, so that each female may in turns be
provided with a pair of fatherless twins, to be duly
pinched to tears, and made to roar their lungs out,
whenever compassionate people are in sight. Unceasing
warfare is kept up with interlopers from
other quarters, who trespass on the domain of this
regularly organised band. Among its members a
dislocated limb, or a disgusting disease, are esteemed
peculiar blessings; an hereditary complaint is a sort

<!-- vol 2 page 266 -->

of an estate, and if conspicuous, and such as to resist
the officious remedies of the charitable, confers
rank, and may be called a badge of nobility. But
even those who have the misfortune to labour under
the most incurable state of health and vigour are
dexterous, if not radically to correct this perverseness
of nature, at least to remove its unpromising
appearance. They excel in the manufacture of
counterfeit wounds and mock diseases; and the
convulsions of a demoniac are graceful movements
to their spontaneous fits.</p>

<p>The troop with which I had the luck to fall in
had destined Erekli for the next day's scene of
action. Its worthy members were taking among the
tombs a comfortable night's rest, previous to the
morning's labours. Already had most of the party
sunk into soft slumbers on the pillows of the fresh
laid graves, when the tramp of my horse, resounding
among the hollow vaults, and reverberated by
the sculptured slabs, roused, and made them start
up and surround me, as has been seen. Their
clamour was only the eleemosynary ditty, which,
from long habit, they kept mumbling even in their
sleep.</p>

<p>Moved with compassion at the sight of so much
suffering, I determined at once to remove all these
accumulated ills, and, for this purpose, began to lay
lustily about me with my good long ox-hide whip.
It would have gladdened a feeling heart to see what

<!-- vol 2 page 267 -->

a salutary and immediate effect followed this application.
At the very first flourish, the lame found the
use of their legs, the blind recovered their sight, and
the deaf and dumb a Stentorian voice. A poor decrepit
creature, doubled with age and infirmity&mdash;straightening
as if by magic&mdash;became all at once as
nimble as a stag: a man, shaped like a dromedary,
slipped his hunch without missing it; and a woman,
eighteen months at least gone with child, stumbling
over a gravestone, brought to light a truss of
straw!</p>

<p>The fright of my friends, however, was not of
long duration. By degrees they began to fancy,
that, though I was armed and on horseback, and
they were unarmed and on foot, yet in the dark,
and among heaps of gravestones, thirty or forty
had a chance against one. In this notion they again
rallied, and soon sticks and stones whizzed about
my ears as thick as hail. I now found that I had
to deal with a set of ungrateful rogues, who, so far
from thanking me for the miraculous cure which I
had performed, only requited good with evil. It
therefore seemed time to leave them to their fate,
and to scamper off; by which means I soon got out
of sight, and a very little while after, out of hearing
of the volleys of abuse, which accompanied the repeated
showers of stones.</p>

<p>The crossing of the Balkan&mdash;which rose in sight
soon after&mdash;would, I suppose, have been a delightful

<!-- vol 2 page 268 -->

treat to one who preferred the remains of a former
worn out world to the good things of the present
renovated globe, and a petrified oyster or cabbage
to fare of easier digestion. For my part, who felt
more anxious to know the end of things than their
origin, I was very glad when I found mount Hemus
fairly left behind me, and still more so, when before
me I beheld winding in ample sweeps the wide waters
of the Danube. My raptures still increased on setting
foot, after crossing the turbid stream, in the plains
of Valachia.</p>

<p>In order to profit as much as possible by the
benefits of Christendom, and to evince the estimation
in which I still held its institutions, I purposed
marking my entrance into its domain, by sleeping the
first night at a monastery. I had heard of one on
the road, where the caloyers lived well, and could
spare a way-faring man a few crumbs from their
table, and a corner in their dormitory. On my
arrival I found my design forestalled. The convent
had been invaded, only an hour before, by a set of
Frank travellers, who carried a licence from the
provincial government to inconvenience at their
pleasure every place on the road.</p>

<p>I say invaded: for between masters, servants,
interpreters, couriers, mikmandars<sup id="r242"><a href="#n242">242</a></sup> and jenissaries,
there were no less, I think, than twenty or thirty individuals;
and for many of the least important among
these gentry singly, the place appeared much too

<!-- vol 2 page 269 -->

small. The very monks had been turned out of
their cells to make room for the strangers.</p>

<p>At first I took for granted that so mighty a removal
of human bodies from the place of their birth
must have an adequate end; and that the head of
the party could be no less than the ambassador of
some great Christian potentate, come to transact
affairs of the utmost importance with the Porte;
and resigned myself in consequence to lay my own
diminished head where I could: but, on discreetly
seeking to have my surmises confirmed by a sort of
courier, half Swiss half Italian, who, in a gibberish
between both, was giving directions to the Greek
steward of the convent, who understood neither, I
could only discover that the padrone was a young
gentleman of great fortune, tired of having every
thing at home in the most comfortable style for
nothing but the trouble of issuing his commands,
and who therefore wandered about the world, to
enjoy the variety of now and then going to bed without
his supper, or getting up without having gone
to bed. Constantinople was to be his first halting-place
on the journey; but whether from thence he
was to go by land to China, or by sea to Peru, was
not yet decided.</p>

<p>I now began to think it somewhat hard that in
the Sultan's own dominions, one of his own liege
subjects, travelling on real business, and who had

<!-- vol 2 page 270 -->

lived long enough not to like going to bed on an
empty stomach, or to think sleeping in the fields a
desirable variety, should be thus kept on the <i>pav&eacute;</i>
by strangers who only came to burthen us with their
ennui: and, accordingly, desired my informer to go
and remonstrate in my name with his master, respecting
the unreasonable monopoly he was exercising;&mdash;fully
determined, should the negotiation
prove inefficient, to resort to more energetic measures
for obtaining redress. I knew that, to whatever
extremities I might proceed, the Greeks would remain
neutral; and I feared not the Franks. All I
apprehended was, that the servant might not deliver
my message in terms sufficiently forcible; and I
therefore soon followed him myself&mdash;highly incensed
at the supposed indignity I was suffering,&mdash;and
bolted into his excellency's dingy chamber, just as
the courier had concluded his speech.</p>

<p>To find all complacency, where one expects a determined
resistance, and is prepared only for using
proportionate force, occasions a shock in the brain
similar to that experienced by the body on sinking
into a down pillow, where movements had been
measured for meeting with a seat of impenetrable
stone; and this sort of shock I experienced, when
received by a young man of the most prepossessing
appearance, only intent upon knowing how he could
most effectually accommodate myself and all my

<!-- vol 2 page 271 -->

suite; and ending by inviting me to partake of his
own indifferent supper, which&mdash;he added&mdash;his companion
had just stepped down to hasten.</p>

<p>Thus courteously addressed, my answer was made
to correspond; and nothing ensued but a conflict of
civilities. It was only interrupted by my going out
again to look after my said suite&mdash;namely, my horse;
ere I gave myself up for the remainder of the
evening to the pleasure of conversing with so
charming and well-bred an host.</p>

<p>His invitation to the strange traveller, meanwhile,
had gone abroad among his own retinue; and,
before I was able to return from my excursion, it
was my good fortune to overhear the impression it
produced on his companion, still engaged in bustling
below stairs. This somewhat less hospitable personage
was pleased loudly to wonder what pleasure
Mr. T&mdash; could find in courting every adventurer,
Turk or Christian, with whom chance brought him
in contact on the road; and grievously moaned over
the selfish vanity which made a man of his sense unfeelingly
put his friends out of their way, merely to
have his politeness admired by utter strangers.</p>

<p>The remark fortunately affected not my appetite.
When the smoking evidences of the amiable companion's
industry appeared on the table, I paid
them not the less every compliment in my power;
and was only the more intent upon diverting their
author from the nefarious purpose of being himself
the first again to destroy the various fruits of his

<!-- vol 2 page 272 -->

labour, by forcing upon him a thousand little attentions,
for which, in his heart, he would have wished
to box my ears. Even this proceeding lengthened
the meal but little. I soon perceived that my host,&mdash;overcome
with the fatigue of the journey&mdash;though
striving to the utmost to entertain his guest, was scarce
in a condition to receive from that guest an adequate
return; and therefore speedily proposed a separation,&mdash;in
which proposal I was most warmly seconded
by his companion, who, sated at last, now sagaciously
observed that, as they were to rise betimes,
they had better go to their rest.</p>

<p>As far as his own share was concerned, it is but
doing the gentleman last named justice to state
that he spared nothing to promote this laudable
object. He kept to himself a mattress which might
have accommodated three more of his fellow-travellers,
and left these&mdash;not <i>friends</i>, I suppose&mdash;unceremoniously
enough, to lie on the bare tiles:
but in spite of this precaution, the nimble tenants
of the place, whose supper was only just beginning,
kept <i>il signor compagno</i> awake. This misfortune
caused him to groan so loudly and so incessantly
all night, that no one else within hearing was
permitted to enjoy the repose which had forsaken
this important personage. I heartily regretted his
fine feelings, and wished he had had some of the
selfishness of his patron.</p>

<p>The moment the Frank party was off, the
caloyers were released from the forced confinement

<!-- vol 2 page 273 -->

in which all, except the superior, had been
held during their stay. I thought this black
gentleman looked at me distrustfully, for having
displayed Frankish freedoms under the Moslem
turban, and feared he might make some report
at Bucharest to my disadvantage. The impression
was to be done away. Taking him therefore
aside, I honestly confessed that I was not only a
Greek&mdash;which my speech confirmed&mdash;but a disguised
emissary from Russia, come to sound the
disposition of the Greek papases in favour of Ekatharina!<sup id="r243"><a href="#n243">243</a></sup>
Hereupon his heart opened: he expressed
his admiration of the Empress; particularly
commended her laudable perseverance in the
privations of widowhood; and earnestly intreated
me to inform her by the first opportunity what a
stanch friend she had in father Kyrillos; dwelling
much all the while upon the means of corresponding
with the well affected to that sovereign, throughout
Valachia, afforded by his convent,&mdash;a hint by
no means lost upon me, when afterwards I had
troops to quarter, and contributions to levy in that
province.</p>

<p>Continuing my journey, absorbed in reflections
which were greatly favoured by my slow progress
through endless swamps, I scarce perceived a personage
who came from whither I was going, till he
pulled up his steed to honour me with a more
minute survey. I returned him the compliment,

<!-- vol 2 page 274 -->

though his equipage little deserved such an attention;
and "Selim!" on his part, and "Condilly!"
on mine, were roared out at the same instant.</p>

<p>This signor Condilly, originally a Roman catholic,
had first married a sister of Mavroyeni's, and
consequently a Greek. On her demise he showed
his grief by embracing the Greek creed himself,
and marrying a Roman catholic. Her he left to
go into a monastery; and the convent he fled from
to take a third wife, younger than the two former.
He had treated his sovereigns as he had done his
consorts. When Venetian consul at the Can&eacute;a,
he sold the interests of the republic to the Turks;
and when employed for the Turks at Zante, he
betrayed them to the Venetians. I had known him
at Constantinople, where he gave himself as much
airs as if he carried Jove's thunder in his sleeve,
and entertained his friends with stories so long and
tiresome, that they would have made the very moon
split her face with yawning. On Mavroyeni's appointment
to the principality of Valachia, he sent
this worthy brother-in-law on before him to Bucharest
as his ca&iuml;makam; and when he came himself,
he appointed Condilly his cupbearer: nor had I
heard, when we met, of any later change.</p>

<p>"Whither bound, Georgacki," cried I;&mdash;"for
the capital or for the army?"</p>

<p>"For whatever place," was his reply, "I may
be invited to. You see me at large again!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 275 -->

<p>"That misfortune," rejoined I, "you seem to
be used to; but how happened this last speedy
dismissal?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" exclaimed Condilly, with a
shrug of the shoulders: "Not I, at least.&mdash;When
a man has his familiar sprite, with whom alone he
takes counsel, we poor mortals must be contented
to remain in ignorance. People do what they
please, when they act by inspiration. You must
have heard of the wealthy Vakareskolo, the Cr&oelig;sus
of boyars,<sup id="r244"><a href="#n244">244</a></sup>&mdash;he who thought himself so secure from
being fleeced, by never appearing at court, and
declining all dangerous distinctions. Well!&mdash;has
not Mavroyeni, by means of his invisible counsellor,
at last hunted him out, and sent to him to say
that the humble should be exalted; and that his
very disinterestedness made it necessary, for the
good of the country, that he should assume some
high and responsible office?"</p>

<p>"The Bey found not the same reason, I presume,
for securing the permanence of my worthy
informant's services?" was my reply.</p>

<p>"His household Demon," rejoined Condilly,
"lately put it into his head that his Greek name
was a base corruption; that he was descended from
the ancient Venetian family of Morosini: and its
Latin translation, Maurocenus, is now the name by
which he insists on being addressed. My tongue
once made an unlucky slip; I called him by the

<!-- vol 2 page 276 -->

name of his forefathers;&mdash;and for this offence he
condemned me, his kinsman, his counsellor, and his
cupbearer&mdash;who tasted every drop of his wine&mdash;to
bread and water in the salt-mines! Had I remained
there long, I must have become pickled alive, and
so have died a vampire, even without excommunication,
and have sucked his blood, as he does that of
others. For that reason only, I suppose, he let
me out at last, on condition of leaving Valachia.
But, O how I shall talk, as soon as I am past the
frontier!"</p>

<p>To me it seemed that signor Condilly waited not
till that period to execute his threat. Loth, however,
to lose time in conversation, where I was sure
not to hear a word of truth: "Hark ye, Georgacki,"
cried I, "you, who are going, may be
right to talk, but I, who am coming, would do
wrong to listen. You have been long enough in
the world to know that the atmosphere of one out
of favour is infectious, and cannot take it amiss if
you are done by as you would do by others. So
adieu; and fare ye well!"</p>

<p>At these words I pushed on. The cup-bearer
called after me, to say that for all the caution with
which I seemed to act, he would take upon himself
to bespeak the horses for my own return. I did
not stop to retort, but made what speed I could,
and the same evening reached Bucharest.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the first moment of the rupture with
Austria, Mavroyeni, expecting Valachia to become
the theatre of the war, had sent his useless princess
and her still more useless train back to Constantinople&mdash;a
wise measure, I thought, where <i>real</i> clouds
were gathering! In order to defray the expenses
requisite for the defence of the principality, he had
levied enormous contributions, not only on the laity,
but on the clergy, who, as ministers of peace, could
not conceive what they had to do with the war, and
thought their task fulfilled when they had prayed
for the safety of the country. He had moreover
banished to Turkey, or put in durance on the spot,
such of the Boyars and others&mdash;no matter what
their rank&mdash;whom he suspected of a secret understanding
with Austria. Among the passes or ravines
which form the only communication athwart
the formidable barrier of mountains that separate
Transilvania from the land of the Roumooms,<sup id="r245"><a href="#n245">245</a></sup> he
had distributed seven or eight thousand se&iuml;men, or
provincial troops. Through his care, Bucharest, a
city of immense extent, lying in an almost dead flat,
for whose safety nature had done nothing, and art

<!-- vol 2 page 278 -->

could do but little, bade as formidable a defence to
an enemy as its situation permitted. Each khan
within its circuit was become a battery, and each
convent a fortress. The very Archi-episcopal
palace, and the cathedral, situated on the only
commanding eminence, were, to the inexpressible
horror of the Valachians, transformed into a citadel.
Soldiers quartered where priests used to say mass,
cannon-balls heaped up where stood the cross, and
muskets and sabres piled where had been raised the
host, completed the dismay of the natives.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of all this bustle of warlike
preparations that I entered Bucharest. At its
gates nothing was seen but groups of weeping
families going out, and detachments of turbulent
soldiers marching in; and wherever I stopped within
its precincts, no other discourse met my ear but
that of banishments, confiscations, fines, imprisonments,
recruitings, fortifications, and plans of attack
and of defence. "Good!" said I to myself; "this
martial discord is music to my ears! It promises
plenty of what I most want: dear delightful confusion!
Born to live in troubled waters, again I
breathe, again I feel in my element:"&mdash;and every
officer of state whose favour seemed expiring, every
grandee of the court whose fall was announced, I
only considered as kindly making room for me.
My feelings somewhat resembled those of the sagacious
birds called vultures, who, the moment the

<!-- vol 2 page 279 -->

battle begins to rage, flap their wings, exult, and
already in imagination revel in their promised
feast!</p>

<p>When, however&mdash;the first tumult of the sense
allayed&mdash;I sat down quietly in my lodging, to
consider how I should best proceed, my reflections
assumed a soberer hue, and my expectations
gradually fell to a less exalted pitch. "I am now,"
thought I, "in a place where I possess not a friend,
nor even an acquaintance; where all must consider
me as an intruder, against whom it is their business
to unite,&mdash;and, in that place, at the mercy of a
single man, and that man, Mavroyeni!&mdash;Mavroyeni,
even in his first dependent state often uncontrollable
and ruled by caprice rather than by cool
reason, and who now, after so long thirsting in a
state of servility for the despotic sway he has at last
obtained, every hour drinks unto intoxication of the
honeyed cup of power. It is true, I bear within my
own breast the qualities which his situation renders
most valuable, and I carry in my pocket the recommendations
which his interest obliges him most to
respect. The commands in my favour of the two
rulers of the state&mdash;by sea and by land&mdash;would,
with any other rayah in his place, leave me no further
trouble than that of announcing my person and
my wishes: and I moreover know Mavroyeni sufficiently
lenient in religious matters, not to regard my
apostacy as a great bar to my promotion, even in his

<!-- vol 2 page 280 -->

Greek principality:&mdash;but," added I, in order to restrain
the too sanguine hopes founded on these considerations,
"may he not retain an unfavourable
impression of my youthful pranks, and my insolent
mode of quitting his service? May he not with still
more probability feel hurt at my long estrangement
from his person, my long apparent disdain of his
protection, my long obstinacy in seeking my fortune
any where upon earth rather than under the shelter
of his raven wing?"&mdash;So often had his wayward
temper only turned the more restive for being more
sharply reined, that, in order to show his independence,
it was likely he might make the very weight
of my recommendations a motive for treating me
with greater coolness.</p>

<p>I therefore&mdash;spite of my expectations&mdash;prepared
my mind for the possibility of an indifferent reception,
and resolved only to advance in so cautious a
manner, as not to stand much committed should I
meet with a rebuff.</p>

<p>In this spirit,&mdash;so far from dressing for my first
audience of Mavroyeni as I had done for my first
interview with Suleiman;&mdash;so far from informing
every passenger as I went along, by the importance
of my looks, that I was going to court; from announcing
in an authoritative tone, on my arrival at
the palace, that I carried letters from the Grand
Visier, the Lord High Admiral, and the Drogueman
of the navy,&mdash;I rather ran into the opposite extreme,

<!-- vol 2 page 281 -->

and, by way of pitching my tone at the outset in
such a key as I might be sure not to have to lower
afterwards, went in so modest a dress, crept into the
audience chamber in so quiet a manner, and, having
delivered my message in a scarce audible voice,
stood so demurely with my hands in my sleeves at
the lower end of the room, that I was scarce noticed
by a troop of gentlemen of far higher apparent pretensions,
who held their more conspicuous station in
the middle of the apartment, and bore such a prodigious
air of self importance, that their very yawnings
(which were both frequent and loud) had in
them a something grand and imposing; while their
conversation&mdash;chiefly intended, it should seem, for
the benefit of distant hearers&mdash;ran entirely upon the
last joke of the Ban of Crayova, the last remark
of the Cameraz, and the last witticism of the
Spatar!</p>

<p>I had heard that in some place or other the humble
were to be exalted: but this certainly was not
in Mavroyeni's ante-room. Its familiars seemed of
a sort not disposed easily to give a stranger credit
for higher claims than he chose to divulge, but, on
the contrary, to indulge a man, desirous of remaining
in the back ground, to the utmost of his wishes in this
to them strange propensity. It is true, they vouchsafed
now and then to honour me with their attention,
so far as to eye me from head to foot,&mdash;but it was
with any thing but a look of invitation to join their

<!-- vol 2 page 282 -->

noble group. This silent scrutiny was even carried
to such a length that at last my patience forsook me,
and I began, in my turn, to stare at the starers with
such steadiness, as gradually to disconcert all their
petulance, and to make them fall from their haughty
self-sufficient look into an appearance of downright
constraint&mdash;till at last one of the set, determined to
beat me out of the field, detached himself from the
cluster, came over to where I stood with a sort of
mock civility, and asked me in a simpering tone,
whether the company had the honour of my approbation?</p>

<p>I was going to answer "No," without circumlocution&mdash;when
suddenly the door of the inner room
opened, and the party fell back to range themselves
round the room in a respectful circle, in the middle
of which the gentleman usher advanced, to select
whom he should first introduce to his Highness.</p>

<p>Each was striving to obtain that distinction, by
straining to protrude the upper part of his body
a few inches before that of his neighbour;&mdash;for as
to me, I did not at that critical moment come into
consideration at all, and would have been entirely
forgotten, had I not informed the usher of my presence,
by holding over the heads of those that
pressed before me certain talismanic papers, at the
sight of which the officer pushed the crowd aside to
let me pass. I now handed to him my credentials,
to be taken to the prince; and, as I delivered my

<!-- vol 2 page 283 -->

letters, amused myself with naming the writers one
by one.</p>

<p>Being, on the strength of so respectable an introduction,
immediately let in, I left my ante-room
friends nearly as composed as if a thunderbolt had
just exploded among them. One half looked pale
as ashes, the other red as crimson; and every one
seemed intent only upon how he should repair his
imprudence, on the re-appearance of the great man
in disguise.</p>

<p>Though my call was speedy, my reception was
not the more promising. Mavroyeni, at first,
deigned not even to greet me with that look of
surprise with which I had laid my account, but
went on with the various occupations in which I
found him engaged, as if unaware of my presence;
leaving me full leisure, in the mean time, to mark
the havock made by ambition more than by age in
his originally hard and homely features. In fact,
the ruling passion seemed to have increased to such
a degree the obliquity which the natural dimness of
his right eye had produced in the motions of the
other, as to have rendered his a perfectly <i>sinister</i>
look, in every sense of the word. He always eyed
one askance! Those to whom he stood opposite,
his eye glanced beside, and, to fix his interlocutor,
he turned his face away from him. It is true that
the undermost features of that same face made
amends in some measure for those above. His

<!-- vol 2 page 284 -->

jet black beard and mustachios, of which he took
great care, encompassed lips whose smile was as
pleasing as the frown of his dark brow was terrific;
and these lips in their turn disclosed, when he spoke,
two rows of teeth as white as drifted snow, which no
man could be more ready to show on all occasions.</p>

<p>For some time after my entrance, however, they
were only uncased in the process of dictating a letter
of three pages to the Re&iuml;s-effendee: and not until
he had finished this and all his other business&mdash;paring
his nails included&mdash;with the utmost composure,
did he seem to perceive that I stood before
him, tired of watching his left eye, and of commencing
bows all stifled in the birth. At last, when
he had fairly exhausted his own occupations and my
patience, he cast a look my way, and appeared to
see me; but it was only to ask in a gruff and snappish
manner&mdash;while pointing to my poor letters
flung unopened on the sofa&mdash;"Whether it was I
who had brought that load of paper?"</p>

<p>I bowed again, and said it was, but only as the
person entrusted with its conveyance. "For well I
know," added I, "that with your Highness neither
interest avails, nor even talent, when presumptuously
relying on its own merit, and unfriended by the sunshine
of your spontaneous favour, heaven-directed
towards its possessor!"</p>

<p>This compliment to the Bey's independence
smoothed the bristles round his heart. His features

<!-- vol 2 page 285 -->

immediately relaxed; and I thought I could
clearly discern through what they retained of outward
rigidity, an inward smile of approbation. At
last his satisfaction even broke out in words. "Right,"
he cried, "my will alone is my law! If you were
the angel Gabriel, descended from the ninth heaven,
you must hit my fancy ere you obtain my favour&mdash;at
least here in Valachia. But,"&mdash;added he, wholly
unbending, "you know I always liked you, in
spite of your pranks; nay, perhaps even the better
for them. You were clever as a lad, and I trust
years have given you discretion, without blunting
your spirit. Tell me,&mdash;for I know you have been
a Kiashef in Egypt,&mdash;how you got that rank; and
how you contrived to lose it?"</p>

<p>Thus invited, I gave the Bey a sketch of my
principal adventures,&mdash;not indeed drawn with the
entire unreserve of these memoirs; but in which,
without startling Mavroyeni's belief by an improbable
account of my excessive wisdom or virtue, I
yet only touched upon my follies and vices with the
tender hand of a friend, whose blame is less severe
than the praise of an enemy. The last occurrence
which I mentioned was the first of my entrance into
the Bey's dominions, the meeting with Condilly.</p>

<p>"He was going to Turkey," said I.&mdash;"Not so,"
answered Mavroyeni; "he was speeding to Vienna:
he only made a circuit to deceive me. It was not
worth the while. I ever knew him do more harm

<!-- vol 2 page 286 -->

to his friends than to his enemies; and so I ordered
that every pass might be opened to him. With you
I mean to do the reverse."</p>

<p>I assured the Bey I should remain a willing prisoner;
and finding that nothing more was wanting
of me for the present, made my bow and retired.</p>

<p>Meantime my seemingly interminable audience
had fully confirmed the idea of my importance among
the inmates of the ante-room. The mystery which
hung over my character only served, like the vapours
which envelope a mountain, to magnify my seeming
grandeur; and when I stole back among my friends
in sheep-skin, I found that during my absence
they had had high words about me,&mdash;each reproaching
the rest for his own incivility. No
sooner did they perceive my return, than they all
dropped some incidental remark, intended to smooth
the way to a more direct address. The gentleman
who had the first turned a deaf ear to my salutation,
had lost his hearing from a cold; the one who
had laughed at me most openly, had been able to
think of nothing but a domestic misfortune which
quite distracted his senses; and as to the one who
attacked me in articulate speech, he always made it
a point, when he saw a stranger of quality anxious
to remain incognito, of doing something or other to
favour the scheme.</p>

<p>Having thus each dropped his little propitiatory
sentence, but without the smallest intention&mdash;poor

<!-- vol 2 page 287 -->

innocent souls!&mdash;of its being overheard, they now
all with the utmost surprise perceived me standing
before them, immediately bowed in the most gracious
manner, and, all speaking together, ventured
in the most obsequious terms to express . . . . . .
but what?&mdash;is the thing I am unable to tell; as,
without stopping to hear it, I left the cringing
circle to divide among them, according to the respective
claims of each member, a single supercilious
glance cast upon the whole troop collectively, and
then, turning on my heel, very quietly walked off.</p>

<p>The next day I received from Mavroyeni a
summons to a pleasure-garden, formed by him
outside the city. "A good omen this," thought I.&mdash;"His
villa is the place where he deposits his
Beyship at the entrance gate;" and truly, among
his tulips and ranunculuses, his temper seemed,
chameleon-like, to reflect a somewhat gayer hue.
It was almost <i>couleur de rose</i>, and not perhaps the
less resembling the queen of flowers, because it had
a lurking thorn. Through Mavroyeni's transient
gaiety of manner and conversation might still be
discerned the stationary weight which oppressed
his heart, as through the fleeting waters of the
stream are seen the rocks that lie motionless on its
gravel bed. The whole drift of the Prince's apparently
unpremeditated discourse tended to find
out indirectly how he was spoken of by the world
at large. "Nothing," he observed, "was so entertaining

<!-- vol 2 page 288 -->

as to hear what people say of one: and
nobody had such opportunities of knowing as a
stranger who mixed in every set, and whom no
party yet mistrusted. Often an indifferent new
comer heard sentiments drop by chance from the
lip, which the person most deeply interested could
not wring from the heart."</p>

<p>"Sir," answered I with great gravity, "Suleiman
the Just,<sup id="r246"><a href="#n246">246</a></sup> of glorious memory, when his subjects
disapproved of his measures, used to cut off not
only the tongues of the railers, but also the ears of
the listeners."</p>

<p>"Sensible Suleiman!" exclaimed the Bey, sighing:
"but I, who am not the supreme ruler of the
empire, may make it my amusement to hear the
various opinions on the merits of my administration."</p>

<p>"What can your highness expect to hear,"
answered I,&mdash;somewhat doubtful of the intensity of
that pleasure, where every one of those opinions
uniformly ended in abuse,&mdash;"but that all who
make your actions the theme of their discourse, vie
in expressions of equal veneration?"</p>

<p>"Which of my virtues are dwelt upon most at
length;" resumed Mavroyeni;&mdash;"my clemency,
or my contempt for money?"</p>

<p>This was a home question: it sounded like wishing
to take flattery by storm; though thus abruptly assailed
from the most vulnerable quarter, she could
scarce avoid inflicting wounds, even with the utmost

<!-- vol 2 page 289 -->

wish to caress. I looked at Mavroyeni to find out
whether, perchance, he only intended the query a
trap to catch the flatterer.&mdash;His countenance gave
me no clue; his features were immoveable.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I therefore, "every one knows the
natural humanity of your disposition; every one
is persuaded that, if in your conduct you depart
in the least from the dictates of clemency, your
tender soul regrets what your trying situation commands."</p>

<p>"I see," rejoined Mavroyeni with a shrug of impatience,
"I can extract nothing from you. Now
at least let me show you I can spare your information.
Let me tell you myself what people say.
They call me&mdash;&mdash;a monster of rapaciousness and
cruelty."</p>

<p>I looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the Bey, raising his voice;
"they call me as covetous as hell, and as merciless
as Satan: and though you try to look astonished,
you know it full well. But what you may not
perhaps know quite so fully, is, that for being what
I am I deserve public thanks."</p>

<p>Here my surprise became real, and I therefore
concealed it.</p>

<p>"Two things," rejoined Mavroyeni, "I assume,
which you will scarcely deny."</p>

<p>I was going to say: "certainly not;" but I
stopped myself in time.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 290 -->

<p>"The first," he continued, "is, that this province
must be defended; and the second, that no
man in the empire is fit to defend it but myself."</p>

<p>I bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Now," added the prince, "how am I to fortify
my province against invasion, without money; and
how, without money, am I to keep myself in my
province? Without the sums necessary to raise
soldiers and batteries, the Austrians march into
Bucharest next month; and without the sums requisite
to fee the Capitan-Pasha, the Visier and the
Sultan, I am turned out of my principality next
year. Let then my avarice light on the heads of
my employers! With them, my generosity would
be my only crime."</p>

<p>"Again;&mdash;as to cruelty," resumed he&mdash;having
paused awhile to breathe. "For what purpose, do
you think, has the Porte made, in my favour, the
hitherto unexampled exception to its rules of joining
the rank of a Turkish Seraskier<sup id="r247"><a href="#n247">247</a></sup> to the prerogatives
of a Greek Hospodar? For what purpose
has the Porte allowed me to command in the field
several thousands of Moslem soldiers? but for that
of enabling me to avert the extraordinary perils that
hang over this province, by extraordinary vigour!
If I then find that from all the various peculiarities
in my situation, as a native of the Isles, as a stranger
to the leaders of the Fanar, and as the Christian
subject of a Mohammedan master, I have every

<!-- vol 2 page 291 -->

body against me, as well within the very heart of
my principality as beyond its boundaries; if I see
the Greek who hates me as an intruder, the Valachian
who prays for the success of the Austrians,
and the Mussulman who looks down upon me as a
yaoor and a rayah, all unite in wishing for my
subversion; if I have to defend myself against the
jealousy of the first, the treachery of the second,
and the fanaticism of the last; if I know that the
least lenity, considered as weakness, will only encourage
the audacity of my enemies, and hasten
my ruin; and if I also know that with me must
perish my trust,&mdash;is it not my duty to my sovereign
and my province, to steady by an extraordinary
pressure the jarring elements ready to fall asunder;
and must I not, neglecting the petty forms of the
law to do the speedier justice, wherever I can,
pinion the suspected, paralyse the traitor, and cut
off the criminal?"</p>

<p>Here Mavroyeni again stopped to draw breath,
and to see what effect his oratory produced; and
having established to his satisfaction the entire propriety
of picking pockets, and chopping off heads,
without waiting to ask the owner's leave, he passed
from his affairs to mine.</p>

<p>"You have much employed my thoughts," said
he, "since your arrival. Unfortunately, by the
capitulation of these provinces, it is as difficult for
a Mohammedan to obtain promotion in Valachia, as

<!-- vol 2 page 292 -->

it is elsewhere in Turkey for a Greek. Few are the
offices to which Turks may be appointed; and yet
I should like to give you something good in itself,
and something too that might not remove you too
far from my person. To combine these conditions
is a purpose which I have turned every way in my
mind. In short, convinced that, with your talent,
it only depends on your will to succeed in any line,
I make you my Divan-effendee.<sup id="r248"><a href="#n248">248</a></sup> It is only exchanging
the sword for the pen."</p>

<p>A mere trifle, thought I:&mdash;the same turn of the
wrist will do to cut a flourish on a sheet of paper
and on the face of an enemy; and it would only be
fancying myself in the field, marshalling a parcel
of soldiers, when I sat in my closet symmetrising
a set of words; and that for the same purpose too&mdash;namely,
of defending ourselves, and of attacking
our enemies. The ministers of the Porte would be
delighted with their new correspondent, and my
epistles could not fail to be preserved as models of
a diplomatic style, for the use of future ages!</p>

<p>Too well, however, I knew the Bey's fondness for
extraordinary measures to express my surprise at the
proposal. "Sir," said I, bowing respectfully, "your
highness has performed so many other wonders, that
I consider the additional miracle of making me all
at once a sober steady secretary, squatted all day
long upon his heels, squaring lines and rounding
periods, as only to depend upon your will: and as

<!-- vol 2 page 293 -->

my forte in the Turkish language has hitherto been
confined to the vulgar dialect, I mean this very minute
to go and study the court phraseology, in order
that the grandees of the capital may have no fault to
find with our provincial despatches."</p>

<p>These suggestions made the Bey reflect a little.
As I prepared to take my leave: "Stop," cried he;
"on second thoughts I may do better in making
you my Besh-lee Aga. You will have the command
of my troop of jenissaries; you will see the
orders of the Sultan carried to the different districts;
you will provide escorts for the great officers
of the Porte; and all that, I know, you will manage
to perfection. It is true, you will also have
to preside in a sort of court of justice, and to decide
in all differences between Mohammedans and Rayahs,
according to the Mussulman code. But what
of that! Where God gives an employment, he gives
the requisite capacity. My Postelnic makes an excellent
secretary of state,&mdash;indeed, all the better
perhaps,&mdash;for not knowing how to sign his name.
I find no fault with my Vestiaris, in his place of
treasurer, though he never learnt the rule of three:
and as to my Spatar, is he a worse minister of police,
I pray, for possessing practical knowledge of
how windows are broken at night, and riots made in
the streets? You will do like all the rest: provide
yourself with a clerk who gets less pay, and knows
more of the business, than his principal; and in

<!-- vol 2 page 294 -->

every doubtful case of law, always presume the
Mohammedan to be in the right; and give verdict
in his favour."</p>

<p>I bowed as before. In truth, I liked the place of
Besh-lee Aga as little as that of Divan-effendee:
but I trusted to the Bey's own mutability of temper
for again changing his plan. I knew the only certain
way to make him persist in a design was to remonstrate.
I therefore silently retired.</p>

<p>The next day I was again summoned. The wind
meantime had, as I expected, shifted to another
quarter. "Skanavi"&mdash;cried the prince, as soon as
he saw me&mdash;"thinks you will make but an indifferent
judge after all. He is sure, he says, you
will never look grave enough in the hall, nor consent
to let your mustachios turn down instead of
up. I myself cannot conceive what made you so
anxious for the employment. Take my word for
it, the command of my arnaoots will suit you much
better."</p>

<p>This happened to be so exactly what I thought
myself, that I now felt fain to argue the point, in
order to have the nail more securely clenched; but,
as the mere act of revolving the expediency of this
measure in my mind gave me an appearance of hesitating,
it answered all the purpose. "No words!"
exclaimed the Bey. "I know what suits you much
better than you can pretend to do yourself. Here
is your commission made out already. Take it; go

<!-- vol 2 page 295 -->

home, and thank God and the bog-fever which has
left so fine a vacancy for you to step into. Your
promotion will cause a few heart-burnings,&mdash;but I
soon depend upon a good dose of leaden pills to
cure them."</p>

<p>I now threw myself at the Bey's feet to thank
him for his favours, and went to assume the insignia,
and to perform the duties of my new station.
Acquaintance was soon made with the officers of
my corps; and obedience enforced somewhat later
among the privates. Many had been haidoots or
banditti before they became soldiers, and seemed
likely to end as they had begun; but, though they
at first looked at me rather askance, we in time
came&mdash;and without needing the court phraseology&mdash;to
a proper understanding.</p>

<p>Of one who like me expected to be but little
stationary, no great establishment was required.
Leaving to prince Brankovano to lie in state alive
in gilt keoschks, amidst troops of female slaves, I
contented myself with a firwood hut for my habitation,
and a few gypsies for my domestics. It is the
fashion to abuse that chattering, lying, thieving,
nimble race, who, invoking Mohammed among the
Turks, and the Holy Virgin among the Christians,
make shift in Valachia to extract gold with equal
dexterity from the filth of its cities, and from the
pure crystal of its mountain streams, and, if they
were all to drive their waggons elsewhere, would

<!-- vol 2 page 296 -->

leave the province without singers, dancers, fiddlers,
fortune-tellers, tinkers, blacksmiths, or grooms. For
my part, I did not dislike their attendance. Too
much despised to be honest, but too timid to commit
atrocious crimes, I found them lively, entertaining,
and sure to succeed in whatever requires
more address than courage, and more dexterity than
labour.</p>

<p>The disorganisation of the Othoman empire often
obliges the sovereign to enforce by stratagem that
absolute right over the lives of his immediate servants,
which the constitution admits; and thence
the government of the Turks frequently presents
a strange contrast of apparent perfidy with real
good faith. Its scrupulous observance of treaties
is proverbial; and has been most powerfully exemplified
in the Greek provinces of Valachia and
Moldavia. When they surrendered to the Turkish
arms they stipulated the preservation of their Greek
worship and rulers; nor has the letter of the capitulation
ever been violated. The governors may have
been changed from the nobles of the country to
the merchants of the Fanar; from men entitled to
the situation by their descent, to individuals only
invested with the office in consideration of their
wealth; but to this day in both provinces the
steeple soars above the minaret, and the worshippers
of Christ take precedence of the followers of Mohammed:
I mean in as far as the internal organisation

<!-- vol 2 page 297 -->

is concerned; for, with regard to external
allegiance, the Greek Hospodar holds his power of
his sovereign by the same tenure as the Turkish
Pasha. A despot in his province, he still remains
the slave of the Padi-shah; and his head may at
any time be included among those with which the
Sultan sometimes adorns the outer gate of the seraglio,&mdash;a
circumstance which, with some, might
be considered as a small drawback upon the felicity
of possessing a court, modelled in all its departments
upon that of the Greek Emperors.</p>

<p>With each new Bey a whole new flight of officers
of state and courtiers comes from Constantinople.
They are generally the relations of their sovereign,
unto the twentieth degree. Mavroyeni, however,&mdash;averring
that these family leeches, the nearer their
consanguinity, the harder they sucked,&mdash;had fewer
hanging about him than any of his predecessors.
My arrival therefore formed a desirable addition to
the intimate circle. Scarce a day passed that I was
not sent for by the prince, to contribute my share
to his entertainment. He distrusted the Greeks
and he feared the Turks. I was an amphibious
animal, which he considered as equally destitute of
the fins of the one and the fangs of the other.
"Selim," he used to say, "will neither bite me,
nor slip through my fingers."</p>

<p>This degree of favour, however, was not without
its inconveniences. Nothing could exceed the variableness

<!-- vol 2 page 298 -->

of the prince's temper. Sometimes all
calm and sunshine, it was at others more stormy
and boisterous than the Black Sea in March. Its
changes chiefly depended on the news from Constantinople.
Whenever a messenger arrived from
the Porte, I used to keep out of the way, until the
object of his mission had transpired. One day I
found the Bey as desponding as if the Fates had
come in person to warn him. "See," cried he in a
tone of despair, "what I have got here!"&mdash;I expected
to behold nothing less than a hattee-shereef purporting
his recall. It was only a Vienna gazette;
and the whole misfortune consisted in an article
dated from Bucharest, in which, it must be owned,
he was somewhat roughly handled. "This ribaldry,"
exclaimed Mavroyeni, "composed in a garret on
the Danube, for the entertainment of a day, will be
preserved by the scribblers of Germany in their
monthly, quarterly, and annual journals; will be,
by the writers of the rest of Europe, chronicled as
an authentic document, and will finally receive
endless durability in carefully written histories,
intended to go down to the latest posterity, as
accurate pictures of the present times. Strangers
will defame my character to all future ages, and
not one of my countrymen will waste a drop of ink
in my vindication. Ah! why was I cast among so
vile a race! why was I born in such a miserable
epoch! I had some generosity, some honest pride,

<!-- vol 2 page 299 -->

some noble sentiments in my composition; and it
was only when I found modesty confounded with
incapacity, and humility considered as meanness;
when I saw virtue excite more distrust than vice,
and successful vice usurp the praise of virtue, that
I cast off qualities which could only prove stumbling-blocks
in my way, and that, like the rest, I became
insidious, vindictive, and faithless:&mdash;but on others
fall the weight of my sins; on others the responsibility
of my good dispositions depraved!"</p>

<p>It may be inferred from this speech, that one of
Mavroyeni's great weaknesses was a desire to make
a figure in history; and many were the things
which he did with no other view but that of their
being recorded. Many also were those which on
that account he enjoyed, though, abstractedly, they
had nothing else very enjoyable in them. When
an earthquake happened, or an inundation, or a fire
which laid waste half the capital, he would rub his
hands and cry out with evident marks of glee;
"Materials for the annals of my reign! Posterity
will say&mdash;this happened in the days of prince
Maurocenus;"&mdash;and in order that posterity might
say this, he would himself, I believe, like Nero,
have set fire to his capital. This thirst for posthumous
notoriety gave all his actions a sort of
theatrical turn, which appeared quite an anomaly
in a Hospodar of Valachia, and made him do things
which in Christendom would have been cried up

<!-- vol 2 page 300 -->

to the skies, and here made him pass for insane.
Nothing frightened him so much as an anonymous
threat of being turned into ridicule, or mentioned
in a slighting manner in some Frank publication:
and I know of two or three heads that were left on
their shoulders, not in consideration of what the
owners might feel, but of what the journalists might
write. Sometimes he thought of imitating prince
Kondemir, and composing the history of his time
himself, in order to make sure of appearing in it as
he wished; but for this he had not leisure yet, and
put it off till after the war. At other times he
talked of dubbing me his historiographer; but then
I was not serious enough, and might make my
readers laugh. At other times he had thoughts of
sending for some French savant; but their heads
seemed all turned by the revolution in their country,
and they might raise the cry of liberty in Turkey.
Meanwhile he never failed to distinguish by his
attentions whomsoever he thought likely to give
him celebrity in verse or prose. Bucharest would
have become a nest of writers of odes and sonnets,
had not sometimes the Bey's fancy been difficult to
hit. For, occasionally, amidst the most lavish praise,
a single word would provoke his wrath; and that
word the author would be sent to correct in the
salt-mines. This place was a great damper to
poetic ardour, and nipped many a bright effusion
in the bud. Nothing, however, under ground or

<!-- vol 2 page 301 -->

above, could daunt the courage of a little hunchback
poet, who conceived himself destined to restore
in modern Greece the pure Hellenic taste. This wry-necked
son of Apollo was admitted to present to the
Bey an ode, composed in his honour on the Pindaric
plan. In conformity to his model he had
despatched the prince's praise in half a dozen words,
and had then passed over to the Lisbon earthquake,
and the fall of Babylon, which served to eke out
the remainder of his performance with as many
rumbling sentences as he wanted. This, however,
suited not exactly Mavroyeni's less classical ideas;
and the poet, finding he did not make the impression
he expected, begged of the Bey to expunge
what he disliked; whereupon the Bey tore all away,
save his name; observing, that that alone would
say more than any rhymer could express.</p>

<p>The author united in his single person all the
irascibility of a poet and a hunchback. He said
nothing; but he sold his habitation, disposed of
his moveables, and retired to the Austrian states.
As soon as safe out of Mavroyeni's reach, he wrote
the prince a letter, to state that he had intended to
make him the hero of an epic poem;&mdash;but that,
since his verses were disliked, he should content
himself with only writing in prose the history of the
war, for which he had contracted with a Leipsic
bookseller; and in which nothing was to be left
out, but himself and his proceedings!</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 302 -->

<p>Meanwhile apprehensions of a very different sort
from those in which the Muses had any share
began to appal the stout heart of Mavroyeni. The
northern frontier of his principality, immediately
bordering on the Austrian states, gave him little
uneasiness. This nature had sufficiently fortified,
by a barrier of mountains, only interrupted by a
few narrow defiles scarcely less inexpugnable than
the heights on either side. The vulnerable part of
Valachia consisted in its eastern boundary, which
lay open to the neighbouring province of Moldavia,
occupied by the Russians. Almost at the outset of
the war these barbarians had entered that principality,
had taken Yassi its capital, and had made
prisoner Ipsilanti its Hospodar; and, though they
had been since driven back upon Chotim, they
threatened every day to recover the lost ground,
and to advance to where only a small rivulet, running
through a dead flat, separated the confines of
Moldavia from those of Valachia.</p>

<p>To defend this line of frontier most immediately
threatened, Mavroyeni had early fixed, for the
rendezvous of his chief forces, upon the plain of
Fockshan, which took its name from an open place
on the borders of the two principalities, belonging
half to the one and half to the other. Thither were
ordered in April, from Bucharest, the arnaoots of
which I commanded the principal division, together
with as many se&iuml;men and provincial jenissaries as

<!-- vol 2 page 303 -->

could be mustered. At the same time were marched
thither from Sophia, where the Visier had now
established his head quarters, several divisions of
infantry and cavalry from the grand army,&mdash;the
stipendiary jenissaries under the command of their
Sangeaks, or generals by promotion, and the feudal
spahees under that of their Agas by descent. When
all were arrived, the collective force at Fockshan
might amount to twelve or thirteen thousand men.
Of these various troops, however, none were to be
depended upon save the Albanians, brave by nature,
and only deficient in tactics and in discipline.
Most of the jenissaries, or infantry, came from
Anadoly.<sup id="r249"><a href="#n249">249</a></sup> They were men engaged in the professions
of peace, forcibly torn from their wives and
families, and who only marched on foot when they
could not afford a horse. The spahees, or horse
soldiers, on the contrary, often only holding their
zeeameth or timar<sup id="r250"><a href="#n250">250</a></sup> from some grandee as the wages
of domestic service, or sent as substitutes by the real
fieffee, a woman or a child, scarce knew for the
most part how to sit on horseback, and would have
looked better on foot. Obliged to furnish their
own equipment and to find their own provisions,
they were only occupied in calculating the length
of their journey and the hour of their return; only
stayed while the pillage of friends or foes afforded
them a subsistence, and, as soon as this mode of

<!-- vol 2 page 304 -->

supply failed, considered themselves free to depart,
and without asking leave, hurried back to their
homes. The provisions supplied by government,
and contracted for by the commanders, were, as
usual, partly from neglect, and partly from fraud,
at once so insufficient and so bad, that it was difficult
to say which was calculated to produce the
speediest mortality, their abundance, or their failure.
Destitute of all regular magazines, the troops must
have been, if not poisoned, at least famished, but
for the immense train of volunteer tellals, or retailers,
who always follow a Turkish camp, impede
the progress of the army, and obstruct its retreat.
When the pay of the soldiers runs short, these
accommodating gentry take in exchange for the
necessaries with which they supply them, their arms,
their accoutrements, and their horses. Thence, on
a sudden emergency, half the Turkish infantry appear
disarmed, and half the cavalry dismounted.</p>

<p>These disorders Mavroyeni saw, but could not
cure. A part only of the forces at Fockshan were
furnished from his principality, and he durst not
remind the remainder, by unwelcome innovations,
that the man who had been raised over the heads
of so many Turks and Moslemen was a yaoor and
a Greek. When, however, on joining the camp, his
own eyes were struck with the unwieldy and disjointed
force brought together, he felt dismayed

<!-- vol 2 page 305 -->

and trembled for the issue. One day, going round
with me to ascertain the observance of some new
regulations, which he found wholly neglected, he
could not help bursting out.&mdash;"You know, Selim,"
cried he, "that I am not a coward; I have sometimes
given proof of bravery, even while prudence
might still have seemed the virtue best suited to
my station; and if at this juncture nothing but
valour was required to insure victory, I should feel
little fear of a defeat: but to what can one look
forward with such a motley assemblage; and on
what quality, pre-eminent on our side, can one
found the least hope of advantage in the conflict?"
"On that," answered I, trying to cheer the prince,
"which the hireling member of those admirably
drilled corps of Christendom&mdash;fighting for a cause
he understands not, and for interests to which he is
a stranger&mdash;wholly wants; on that which alone, in
the undisciplined gatherings of the Turks, often
compensates for every absence of order, tactics, and
subordination; on that which has often made the
bands, led on by its powerful stimulus, defeat
double their numbers&mdash;on fanaticism! on the enthusiastic
intrepidity with which the Moslim soldier
contemns, nay courts in battle a death, which he
regards as the sure passport to eternal bliss!"</p>

<p>Somewhat revived by this speech: "It is singular,"
replied Mavroyeni smiling, "that a Greek
should be the person most desirous not to see

<!-- vol 2 page 306 -->

Turkish fanaticism abate; most anxious not to let
the fair-headed hordes from the north afresh plant
the cross on the banks of the Bosphorus:&mdash;but so
my strange fate ordains; and this blessing I can
only pray heaven in its goodness to grant!"</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> such a length of time had the Supreme Visier
remained stationary at Sophia, that Constantinople
began loudly to murmur at his inactivity. In order
to restore the capital to good humour, Youssoof resolved
to sacrifice a part of his army. The Bannat
of Temeswar was the theatre chosen for this farce&mdash;or
rather, tragedy. The attention of the few
Austrian forces left in that province was, however,
first to be diverted. For that purpose the commander
in chief directed Mavroyeni to attack successively
all the passes between Valachia and Transilvania,
and sent him a reinforcement of about four
thousand fresh troops, half foot and half cavalry.
With these, and what other troops he could afford
to draw from the camp at Fockshan, the Bey successively
tried his strength, in conformity with his
instructions, against the passes of Terzburg, of
Vulcan, and of Rothenturm; but the expeditions
against these formidable defiles all ended alike in
failures, and Mavroyeni now wished to give up the
destructive and hopeless attempt. The Visier was
not so easily to be satisfied. Having crossed the
Danube at Widdin, and skirted with his army the

<!-- vol 2 page 308 -->

western borders of Valachia, he renewed his orders
to the prince to make a more vigorous assault on
the still untried passes in the vicinity of Cronstadt&mdash;a
rich and commercial town, whither the fugitive
Boyars had sent all their treasures for safety. The
Bey hereupon formed at Valeni a fresh force, consisting
of about three thousand spahees, already
broken in to the business by the attack of the former
passes, and of about two thousand five hundred
arnaoots and jenissaries, drawn fresh from the camp
at Fockshan, and consequently new in this species
of warfare. Some German deserters from the different
passes, well acquainted with their intricacies
and defence, were to serve as guides; and the pass
of Bozan was the first to be attacked.</p>

<p>To me had been confided the conduct of the expedition:
mine was to be the glory or the disgrace
of the result; and accordingly I determined that
nothing should be wanting which skill or vigilance
(I do not mention courage) could effect to ensure
complete success.</p>

<p>On the ninth of August I sent on from Valeni
six hundred spahees, who the same day reached the
vicinity of the Austrians, and threw themselves into
an abandoned intrenchment opposite their lines.
On the tenth I led on the principal division, composed
of eight hundred arnaoots and twelve hundred
more spahees. We halted within three leagues of our
advanced guard, and were joined a few hours later

<!-- vol 2 page 309 -->

by the remainder of the cavalry, and by all the infantry.
Early on the eleventh our whole collective
force arrived under the heights of Poru-Ilke, the
first object of contention.</p>

<p>To secure this commanding eminence was a point
both essential and difficult: but, gently sloping towards
the Austrian lines, it could not fail of being,
on the slightest suspicion of such a design, immediately
occupied by a troop of horse stationed in
observation on their right flank. For the purpose
of deceiving this corps I made our spahees and
jenissaries advance leisurely under the hill, as if with
the intention only to wind round its base; and
while their lengthened column engaged the attention
of the Austrians, our arnaoots attempted the most
practicable part of the ascent, on the reverse of the
eminence, and succeeded to drag our artillery up to
its top; only halting within a few yards of the brow
and of the enemy's line of sight. This man&oelig;uvre
thus happily achieved, I gave the signal for all the
troops still advancing in the hollow, to wheel to the
right, and to scramble up the hill; and the moment
the Austrian cavalry set forward in hopes to gain
its summit the first, every inch of its level appeared,
as if by magic, covered with our arnaoots,
who, sending forth loud shouts of defiance, straightway
opened their fire.</p>

<p>At this unexpected sight the Austrians, already
in full gallop, again suddenly stopped; for a moment

<!-- vol 2 page 310 -->

looked in unutterable consternation alternately at
our Albanians above, whom they dared not approach,
and at our spahees below, who already baffled their
pursuit; and at last again wheeled about, and, in
utter despair, resumed their original position.</p>

<p>It was a fine thing to behold the troops, first
marching silently in the hollow defile, all at once,
under the cheers of their comrades perched on the
impending hill, rush at full speed up its steep and
rugged sides, cut their way through copse and briar,
scale heights that seemed inaccessible, leap like goats
from crag to crag, stumble, fall, rise again, help
or push each other on&mdash;the foremost serving as
stepping-stones to those behind, who, in their turn,
hauled up the clusters over whose backs they had
vaulted&mdash;and this amidst the thunder of the enemy's
incessant fire, which our troops tried to drown in
their wild and stunning shouts.</p>

<p>At last, with incredible labour, my left division
overcame every obstacle, reached the summit of the
hill, and there joined and shook hands with their
comrades on the right, already in full possession of
the height.</p>

<p>In this eligible position, commanding the Austrian
lines in front, and screened in the rear by a
curtain of close woven brushwood, which left the
enemy equally unable to guess our numbers, and to
effect our dislodgement, we spent the night. While
darkness lasted the atmosphere was clear, and the

<!-- vol 2 page 311 -->

stars twinkled like diamonds in the firmament; but
with the sun rose so dense a fog, that it seemed to
spread an impenetrable veil before every object, and
things became less visible in the morning than they
had been during the night. Determined to avail
myself of the impalpable screen which surrounded
us, I sent our foremost spahees&mdash;still watching as
well as watched from their intrenchment&mdash;to charge
the Austrian horse, again immoveably fixed on the
flank of the hostile lines.</p>

<p>Attacked on a side on which they thought themselves
secure, and prevented by the fog from discerning
the number of their assailants, these heroes
were seized with sudden panic, took to flight at the
first fire, and yielded up to my spahees their advantageous
position.</p>

<p>Meantime I led the main body of my troops
down the hill. The right side of its declivity was
screened by the continuation of the copse through
which my arnaoots had penetrated, the left side by
that of the precipice which my jenissaries had
scaled, and in front hung the mist, which equally
prevented our seeing, or being seen, at ten yards
distance.</p>

<p>A pretended Austrian deserter had engaged to
point out to us the most practicable mode of turning
the enemy's intrenchments. The fellow was
riding by my side, but something suspicious in his
manner induced me closely to watch his motions.
Suddenly I saw him waver, pull up his horse, pretend

<!-- vol 2 page 312 -->

to turn aside for some frivolous purpose, and,
thinking the moment was his, dart forward, rush by
me, and run away at full speed.</p>

<p>Our approach, our numbers, and our disposition
would, thanks to his agility, have been announced
to the enemy just at the critical moment. I immediately
pursued my fugitive, and fired both my
pistols at him: but the fog prevented my taking
aim, or even seeing where the traitor went. He
soon vanished out of sight.</p>

<p>Little however did his deceit avail him. I scarce
had proceeded fifty yards, ere I heard a heavy
plunge down the precipice, from the bottom of
which, as I advanced, arose dismal groans. They
told me the fate of the double deserter. The fog
had only saved him from being shot, to make him
break his neck.</p>

<p>In pursuing the scoundrel, however, I had got
on some way in front of my men, and, on doubling
a projecting crag, I all at once found myself in, the
midst of a cluster of Austrian hussars. Come forth
from their lines for the purpose of reconnoitring,
they had been attracted towards us by the firing
of my pistols&mdash;the only warlike sound which had
broken the silence of our march; but had prudently
stopped behind this screen of jutting rocks.</p>

<p>At this rencontre I gave myself up for lost.
Still I determined to make some little attempt at an
escape, ere I surrendered at discretion. "Friends,"
I therefore cried, to the troop, in Italian, "so you

<!-- vol 2 page 313 -->

heard my signal!&mdash;Assist a flying Christian, rid me
of my turban, and let me have a hat."</p>

<p>At this address all cheered me with loud huzzas.
Every cap was waved in air;&mdash;but while by that
means every arm was engaged, I seized my time.
Already the tramp of our horse shook the ground.
Suddenly I wheeled about, and quick as lightning
galloped back to my column. A volley of musketry,
it is true, followed, to slacken my speed; but the
balls only whizzed about my ears: none hit my person;
and the hussars, not liking to fight in a fog,
immediately sheered off.</p>

<p>We had scarcely advanced a hundred yards
further, when the mist all at once cleared up, the
hidden landscape became visible, and, within a
pistol shot of our column, rose in full sight before
us the whole extent of the Austrian lines. A
tremendous fire from every battery immediately
saluted me. I only answered the compliment by
giving the signal for the assault; and while the
body of spahees who had dislodged the enemy's
cavalry fell upon their lines in flank, we stormed
them in front.</p>

<p>Our arnaoots scrambled, with the help of their
sabres, up the steep sides of the batteries, and our
jenissaries extracted with their teeth the matches
from the guns. The palisades were broken down,
and the chevaux-de-frize filled up with the slain:&mdash;for
many were the brave that fell between the first assault
and the forcing of the lines. At last the enemy's

<!-- vol 2 page 314 -->

fire began to slacken, and their numbers diminished.
A breach was made, and from all sides our troops
poured in like a resistless torrent. But, though we
beheld heaps of killed, we found nothing alive.
The Austrians had fled with such precipitation, as
not even to spike the guns which they could not
carry off.</p>

<p>On advancing to the custom-house and other
buildings which lay behind the now mastered fortifications,
they too appeared abandoned. From the
high ground which these edifices occupied, the Austrians
might distinctly be discerned, already at a
considerable distance, trying to gain the narrow part
of the defile which separated us from the frontier
town of Cronstadt.</p>

<p>Harassed as we were, I still wished the pursuit
to suffer no interruption. We therefore continued
to press close upon the heels of the fugitives. It is
true that in the ravine which we were entering,
three hundred men in close order might with ease
have arrested a whole army; but, seized with a panic
which grew as they advanced, every man among the
Austrians was flying singly. One troop indeed of
about thirty had kept together, and tried for a moment
to check our progress. It only succeeded to
increase the bloodshed, and was soon entirely cut to
pieces.</p>

<p>Presently, on turning some projecting ground, we
beheld at a distance the outlet of the defile; and at
the now almost undoubted certainty of pushing on to

<!-- vol 2 page 315 -->

Cronstadt without interruption, a general shout of
joy arose among our men.</p>

<p>The only thing in the prospect which we did not
much like was a fancied appearance of some of the
enemy, till now in full retreat, slackening their pace
soon after, to halt and face about. At first indeed
we doubted the accuracy of our optics, but presently
we no longer could help yielding to the evidence
of our senses.</p>

<p>On the first intelligence which had reached Cronstadt
of the danger that had threatened the pass of
Bozan, three thousand men,&mdash;nearly all the place
contained,&mdash;had been despatched to strengthen this
important outpost. Early on its march the first
division of these troops met the foremost of the fugitives,
and learning from them that the lines had
been evacuated, pressed on, in hopes to stop our
progress ere we had cleared the defile. All their
comrades whom they fell in with, were forced to
turn back with them: only they were placed in the
rear of the new comers, in order that our exhausted
strength might have chiefly to contend with their
own still undiminished vigour.</p>

<p>Little indeed were we in a condition to resist a
charge of fresh cavalry, when, from the distant
eminence on whose brow these new troops first
rose in sight, they bore down upon us with all the
advantage of a continued declivity. Still I resolved
to make a stand, thinking the corps a small one; but

<!-- vol 2 page 316 -->

when, just as we had engaged with this first division,
a second, till then concealed in a hollow, appeared
on the hill, I felt the game was up, and
not a moment must be lost in making good our
retreat.</p>

<p>On the first symptoms of the enemy's rallying, I
had judged my harassed men in need of some extraordinary
support. With this view I infused into
them copious draughts of courage in a liquid shape.
It did its office; speedily reached the heart, and
mounted to the brain. A small party became so inflamed
by its inspiration with the wish to gain heaven
the nearest way, that, not content to be quietly killed
on the spot, they even climbed up a ledge of rocks
overhanging the road, whence they contrived, by
means of trees, stones, &amp;c. hurled down the precipice,
to retard the progress of the Austrians, while
the rest of our troops effected in tolerable order their
retrograde motion; so that, after setting on fire the
contumace,<sup id="r251"><a href="#n251">251</a></sup> and abandoning the dearly purchased
intrenchments, we were enabled, with little additional
loss, to regain the Valachian territory.</p>

<p>Seeing that the impending night prevented the
enemy from pursuing us on our own ground, we
now slackened our pace, and in a more leisurely
manner proceeded back to Valeni.</p>

<p>One thing affected my troops very sensibly: it
was the losing in the retreat most of the prisoners
which they had made in the pursuit. The stoutest

<!-- vol 2 page 317 -->

and most active had found means to recover their
liberty in the first confusion of our flight: the wounded
and the disabled alone had remained in our
hands; but these only impeded our march. Half
of them, however, had the discretion soon to die of
their own accord by the way; and those that seemed
perversely determined to live on, for no other purpose
but to give us trouble, found their proceeding
of little advantage to themselves. They were mostly
submitted to the operation of having their upper
extremities severed from the remainder of their
bodies, in order that the latter might encumber their
captors no longer, and the former only be saved for
the sake of the reward. I tried, indeed, to keep a few
of the best looking heads fast on their shoulders;
but it was a business in which my men felt extremely
jealous of my interference. "They liked," they
said, "to settle it their own way."</p>

<p>We were marching on pell-mell in the dark, when,
arrived at a somewhat uneven pass, we found a
saddle horse tied to a tree. My arnaoots recognised
the animal as the steed of one of their comrades,
who had gone on before with a Hungarian officer
badly wounded, whom he wished to preserve&mdash;not
so much from excess of humanity, as for the sake of
his ransom. A few yards farther on, we stumbled
upon a man lying in the road. Him I first supposed
to be the Hungarian, who, unable to keep body and
soul together on so rough a journey, had given up

<!-- vol 2 page 318 -->

the ghost, and had been left in that place, as unworthy
of further conveyance. On examining more
closely, it proved to our utter astonishment to be the
arnaoot himself, quite dead, and with a deep gash in
his side. As to the officer, no trace of him appeared.</p>

<p>The only idea which naturally suggested itself to
my mind was that some of my Albanians had themselves
despatched their companion, for the sake of
his envied prize; but this surmise I did not think
it expedient to publish. The party around me all
were, or pretended to be convinced, that Kara Mustapha
must have been murdered by his own prisoner;
and I was forced at last to grant that nothing seemed
so likely to put a fellow of Kara Mustapha's size
and strength off his guard, as a man half dead,
bound hands and feet, and flung like a clothes-bag
across his horse's shoulders.&mdash;"Nay, so proud,"
added I, "does the culprit seem to have been of his
achievement, that he has not even taken the murdered
man's horse to assist him in his flight, but has
walked away on foot, leaving the animal secured, on
purpose to tell the tale of his prowess!"</p>

<p>My arnaoots paid little attention to this remark;
but hearing something stir among the bushes, all ran
to the spot, and found the Hungarian, whom they
had supposed far away, lying behind a tuft of trees,
with his clothes half torn off; and, what seemed
more surprising, they found not my suspicions but
their own confirmed!&mdash;the officer himself, when

<!-- vol 2 page 319 -->

accused of having killed his captor, scorning to deny
the charge, and looking with a sort of complacency
at the ensanguined blade of the knife with which he
had done the deed, and which he still held firmly
grasped in his hand.</p>

<p>"Wretch," now cried I, indignantly, in Italian,
"what could induce you to murder the preserver of
your life?"</p>

<p>"Its cold-blooded destroyer, rather call him,"
answered the officer, in a voice almost extinct.&mdash;"Finding
that I encumbered his horse, and could
not go on foot, the miscreant wanted to strip and
then to kill me. A cutlass still lay concealed along
my thigh. My hands being untied to take off my
jacket, I drew out the knife unperceived, and, while
the ruffian leaned over me to unclasp my belt, buried
the trusty blade in his heart; then raised myself,
and tried to mount his horse. The task exceeded
my strength: feeling I could not accomplish it, I
crept to these bushes, to die among them unperceived.
Alas I even this, I find, is denied me."</p>

<p>Fast as the officer's life seemed fleeting away, yet
were the arnaoots, in their thirst to revenge one of
their own body, still going to hasten its departure,
when I interposed, and, clasping their intended
victim in my arms, tried to avert their sullen rage.
During his narration, I had imagined I recognised
in the dying man's disfigured countenance that of
an old acquaintance&mdash;I may say, a sort of benefactor.

<!-- vol 2 page 320 -->

I remembered in the days of my <i>ciceroneship</i>
at Pera a young gentleman from Hermanstadt,
attached to the imperial mission, who had shown me
much kindness. He was then, from his extraordinary
beauty, called the Hungarian Apollo; and
indeed was one of the finest youths I had ever beheld;
nor less brave than handsome, or less amiable
than brave. As a faithful biographer of other
people's lives as well as my own, I am indeed forced
to acknowledge that, where a fine eye shot forth
its keenest darts, the heart of my Hungarian was a
little too vulnerable; that too many of the premature
fruits which happened to ripen on the Bosphorus
were laid at his door; that the infant son of
an ambassadress of the highest rank&mdash;a child beautiful
as an angel&mdash;bore to the son of Herman much
too great a resemblance; and that he was even supposed
to have behaved in a way far from respectful
to the venerable Pasha of Erzerum, one day that,
suddenly seized at Boyookder&eacute;<sup id="r252"><a href="#n252">252</a></sup> in the midst of all
the diplomatic beaux and belles, by a troop of
bostandjees&mdash;blindfolded, whipped into a close araba,
and whirled no one knew whither&mdash;he was in fact
conveyed to the summer palace of this worthy
Pasha's truant spouse; a lady of the imperial blood,
and less tender of her distant husband's feelings
than she ought to have been:&mdash;but, in many
of these instances, Miazinsky, as it were, only
yielded to positive violence; was often the first to

<!-- vol 2 page 321 -->

deplore his personal attractions; went no further
than was necessary to prevent a parcel of angels
from exposing themselves in public; and, far from
confining his charitable exertions to young and
handsome females, showed such general benevolence,
that scarce an act of humanity of any description
came to light at Pera, which might not be
brought home to the blushing Hungarian:&mdash;though,
from equal solicitude to conceal his kind-hearted
exertions of the latter as of the former species, his
stolen marches often obtained the full praise of gallantry,
when, in fact, they only deserved credit for
vulgar goodness.</p>

<p>While, however, the youth's discretion continued
unimpeached,&mdash;insomuch as even to offend the
vanity rather than excite the apprehensions of certain
of his fair friends,&mdash;his courage seemed on one
occasion entirely to forsake him. It was at a gay
supper with various foreigners. Another <i>jeune de
langue</i><sup id="r253"><a href="#n253">253</a></sup>&mdash;envious of his more favourable reception
in a quarter where both had been candidates for
sweet smiles&mdash;insulted him very grievously, and
even went so far as to add to opprobrious language,
contemptuous and threatening gestures. Every
person looked aghast, expecting to see weapons of
death drawn across the very supper table, and the
yet untouched dainties deluged in blood: but to
the amazement of all beholders, the Hungarian,

<!-- vol 2 page 322 -->

though reddening up to the eyes, continued otherwise
unmoved, and made no signs of demanding
satisfaction. I alone, who happened to be leaning
over the back of a chair next to his own, knew
what to think: for when a neighbour asked him in
a whisper, how he could put up with such behaviour,
I heard him answer in a suppressed tone,
"Why disturb the short pleasure of so many cheerful
guests? first let us finish this good supper, and
then cut each others throats!"</p>

<p>And so in fact it was arranged. Never did Miazinsky's
antagonist digest the good cheer of that
night. Ere the dawn arose, Miazinsky most religiously
killed him, begged&mdash;ere he expired&mdash;his
pardon for so doing; and then threw himself at his
ambassador's feet, to relate to him the necessity he
had been under of removing his colleague. The
Baron advised the youth <i>not</i> to wait for his answer,&mdash;a
hint which he took: but as he was a favourite
with all the family, the daughters included, and
had the concurring testimony of the whole supper
table to his unimpeachable behaviour, the single
life which he had taken was excused in favour of the
many he had saved or bestowed; and his pardon
was, through dint of great interest, at last obtained.
Still was he obliged to relinquish the diplomatic
career for which he seemed little qualified; but, having
shown greater aptitude for the military profession,

<!-- vol 2 page 323 -->

he failed not, in consequence of his high character
and good conduct, as soon as the affair blew over,
to obtain rapid promotion in the army.</p>

<p>Not only all these circumstances, but the person
to whom they related, were still most distinctly
impressed upon my memory. I still saw the youth
at Pera, as he entered the Internuncio's drawing-room&mdash;his
fine athletic figure set off to the
greatest advantage by his close Hungarian dress&mdash;striking
every person present with the grace and
elegance of his appearance, and causing every fan
to flutter, and every female feature to glow. I even
remembered that, little as I was apt to envy others
for their looks, I had once run to a large mirror, in
order to compare notes with the dazzling stranger;
and, though the poor creature now lying naked at
my feet, encrusted with clotted blood and dust,&mdash;his
eyes half closed, and his pallid features all indented
with scars,&mdash;differed most wofully in many
respects from the brilliant image imprinted in my
mind, yet did I discern in a few others such strong
marks of identity, that I could only satisfy myself
by asking at once, whether I beheld the count Miazinsky,
formerly in the Austrian mission at Pera.</p>

<p>At these words the dying officer again opened his
languid eyes, and looking at me earnestly, as if in his
turn to find out who could thus recognize him in
his present miserable condition, faintly answered,

<!-- vol 2 page 324 -->

"I am he indeed: but you, who ask the question,
may I know who you are?"</p>

<p>"One," I replied, "whom, in the number of
those you were eager to serve, you may not recollect;
but one who cannot forget you, and would
wish to do for your comfort what little this dreary
place may leave in his power."</p>

<p>Then turning to my arnaoots, who grinned with
impatience at the constraint imposed upon their
fury: "The Prophet," I exclaimed, "has given
the faithful the choice of making their enemies
captives, or of killing them on the spot; but he
allows not his followers to begin with the one, and
to end with the other. To this officer his poor
remnant of life had been granted. It could not be
retaken from him. In defending it against his
aggressor, he has only made use of his undoubted
right. He had therefore reconquered his freedom,
when again I seized upon his person.&mdash;He now is
mine alone; and whoever shall at present dare to
attempt his life, robs me of my property, and shall
have me to account with for the deed!"</p>

<p>The assertion was true, and the tone caused its
truth to be respected. Proceeding to do for the
officer what little the untoward circumstances of the
hour and place permitted, I made him swallow a
few drops of the wine we had found in the house of
contumace. On its wetting his lips, he seemed for

<!-- vol 2 page 325 -->

an instant to revive, and exclaimed: "Alas! it is
my own Menesh you are giving me; that to which
I used to treat my most valued comrades. I may
now drink it myself. Never more shall I behold a
friend to make welcome to this cordial!"&mdash;and in
truth, the transient spark of seeming amendment
which enlivened the stranger's countenance was
only a last gleam of the expiring lamp.</p>

<p>I wished to have tarried with him on the spot till
daylight, or to have had him conveyed on in a litter
to where we meant to halt; but the proposal to
carry an infidel on Islamite shoulders, even though
I offered to take my turn with the rest, was received
by my proud Moslemen with such haughtiness, that
I durst not insist. All I could do for the poor
Hungarian was to have him laid across a baggage-mule,
and to walk by his side; trying with one
hand to steady his body, while with the other I
supported his head.</p>

<p>In this position I saw him, as we marched on,
by degrees grow fainter and fainter. At last, on
some inward anxiety appearing to agitate his mind,
I again stopped; and&mdash;in order that he might be
relieved of what made his fleeting soul depart in
such sadness&mdash;conjured him to confide to me his
utmost thoughts and wishes.</p>

<p>"Then would you," said he at last, after some
hesitation, and collecting all his remaining strength
to speak more intelligibly,&mdash;"would you do a dying

<!-- vol 2 page 326 -->

man one last great favour, which God and your
own heart alone can repay?"</p>

<p>"Any thing in my power;" I eagerly answered.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" replied he.&mdash;"Observe; my
mother's address there is not time to give you.
But knowing me, you will easily discover it. Send,
oh! send her&mdash;with a son's last duty, love, and
gratitude&mdash;the account of my death, and a lock of
my hair; and beg of her to divide that last token&mdash;too
well she knows where, and with whom!"</p>

<p>This request I pledged myself punctually to
perform: then tried to administer the only consolation
in my power&mdash;that of sympathy. Pressing
the youth in my arms: "I feel," exclaimed I,
"how hard it is to quit life in a strange land, far
away from the endearments of parents and of
friends."</p>

<p>"Of these," answered the Hungarian, "I might
have been deprived even dying nearer home; and
it then would have been with greater bitterness.
Here, at least, I can fancy all I miss,&mdash;and the idea
soothes my soul during the few yet remaining
minutes, after which it no longer will signify where
Miazinsky ceased to be!"</p>

<p>Tears started from my eyes: they fell on the
officer's wan cheek. A slight pressure of his hand
told me he felt their value, and thanked the giver
for them. Soon however his breath almost became
imperceptible. At last a sort of convulsive tremor

<!-- vol 2 page 327 -->

ran through all his limbs, and again vanished. I
examined his countenance. The moon, which had
just risen in her full splendor, cast a bright gleam
over his features. I saw him again open his eyes,
and fix them upon me with an expression of gratitude,
which his palsied lips could no longer confirm.
He however seized the hand I held clasped round
his waist, made a sort of feeble effort to bring it
to his mouth, once more uttered a faint sigh,
stretched out his limbs, and died.&mdash;Eternal bliss
attend his departed spirit!</p>

<p>His poor remains I wished to have preserved
entire, in order to honour their funeral with decent
rites; but on that subject my arnaoots were intractable.
Forced, therefore, to content myself with
the ample braids of the youth's raven hair, which
I claimed for the purpose he had specified, I let my
Albanians dispose as they chose of the remainder
of his person.</p>

<p>After marching almost the whole night without
interruption, we stopped just before daybreak to
take a little rest. Having thus somewhat refreshed
ourselves, we again proceeded, and towards the
evening re-entered Valeni;&mdash;little thanked for laurels
which, though we certainly reaped, we could
not carry home; and only loaded with a few heads,
which I would have felt little sure of not being
those of my own slain arnaoots, bagged by their

<!-- vol 2 page 328 -->

greedy companions, were it not that Moslem warriors
prudently shave their polls. Should my reader
feel disposed to quarrel with my very minute account
of this expedition, let him remember that I
write principally for my own amusement; and to
me, what event of the war could be so interesting as
the affair of Bozan, of which I was the hero?</p>

<p>At Valeni, we soon received intelligence that not
only that defile, but all the other passes into Transilvania
were fortified in such a way as to preclude
all further chance of retrieving our disappointment.
The scheme of forcing them was therefore given up,
and soon I received orders to march all the troops
back to Fockshan, where from all quarters fresh
clouds seemed to be gathering.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Russians under Romanzow had early in the
season retaken Yassi. The Austrians under Coburg
had advanced to Adjood. So far from heeding a
Bimbashee<sup id="r254"><a href="#n254">254</a></sup> with about eighteen hundred men,
whom Mavroyeni sent about the middle of October
to dislodge from that place their out-posts, they still
pushed on, and at last took possession of the town
of Fockshan. Valachia now seemed in the utmost
danger: the approaching winter alone suspended
its fate. The combined armies, considering the
entire occupation of Moldavia as progress sufficient
for that year, went into quarters. Yassi became
the resting-place of the Russians; Coburg stayed at
Romano; while we remained, not entirely at ease,
in our camp near Fockshan.</p>

<p>On the other side of Valachia things wore not a
more favourable aspect. Youssoof Visier had, by
his irruption in the Bannat of Temeswar, successively
elated the empire to the highest pitch of joy,
and plunged it into the deepest affliction. So sudden
had been the reduction of the province, and so
great the terror spread by the Visier's success, that

<!-- vol 2 page 330 -->

Buda, nay the Austrian capital itself, already fancied
the Turks at its gates:&mdash;but a mightier hand than
that of man marked Mehadieh as the utmost point
of Youssoof's progress. Under the walls of that
fortress the pestilential influence of a low marshy
country, doubly envenomed by a season unusually
wet, carried off his men in such numbers, that, in
order to preserve a few, he was obliged abruptly to
abandon his conquests. With the same speed with
which he had led into the Bannat a numerous and
exulting army, he led out of it a handful of troops
enfeebled by disease; and was compelled, at the
close of the year, to conclude with the Austrians for
the three first months of that ensuing, a mortifying
armistice.</p>

<p>The confidence of the Turks in their naval commander
had experienced an equally complete revulsion.
When, early in the spring of 1788, Hassan Capitan-Pasha,
with eighteen ships of the line,
twenty frigates, and gun-boats innumerable, sailed
up the Euxine to seek the Russian squadron near
Kinburn, the whole empire augured from his valour
and his force the most brilliant success. But when,
as month succeeded month, defeat followed defeat;&mdash;when
first Hassan's gun-boats were destroyed by
Nassau in the Liman; when, next, his fleet was
repulsed with considerable loss by Paul Jones at
Gluboka; and when, lastly, his entire armament
was annihilated by these two commanders united off

<!-- vol 2 page 331 -->

Kinbum,&mdash;terror and dismay gradually filled each
Moslem heart, all clothed themselves in sackcloth
and ashes, and all saw the hand of Providence
raised against the breakers of the peace.</p>

<p>What then became the consternation of the faithful,
when, on the seventeenth of December, Potemkin
took the important fortress of Ockzakow! The
shock produced by this event baffles all powers of
description,&mdash;and, after a year marked by the imminent
danger of Valachia, the loss of Moldavia,
the destruction of the Turkish army, the annihilation
of the Othoman fleet, an inglorious armistice
concluded with Austria, and a bulwark of the empire
lost to the Russians, calamities seemed destined
not to cease until the race of Othman should have
been driven out of Europe. The populace of Constantinople,
whose discontent at these distant defeats
was still inflamed by the detachments from
the Visier's army, which daily under their own
eyes repassed the Bosphorus in the most shattered
condition, now with as loud a clamour demanded
Youssoof's head, as before they had demanded his
appointment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, renouncing all further schemes of
offensive warfare, the Visier determined to concentrate
his forces as much as possible for the defence
of the empire itself. He sent Mavroyeni five thousand
additional men, which, distributed between
Ardgis, Rimnik, Brankovano, Valeni, and Kimpina,

<!-- vol 2 page 332 -->

seemed to render secure the frontier of the principality;
and himself, during the suspension of hostilities,
marched into Bessarabia.</p>

<p>Already was he lifting his hand, to strike from
this new point a blow in Moldavia, which promised
us not only a return of security but a renewal of
success, when an event took place which damped
all our hopes and paralysed all our strength.</p>

<p>This was the demise&mdash;unannounced by any previous
warning&mdash;of the Sultan Abd-ool-Hameed, and
the accession of his nephew Selim. Without the
smallest preparation for so great a change, this
young prince suddenly passed, on the 7th of April,
1789, from the confinement of the harem, to the
throne of the Turkish despots.</p>

<p>Like all other rulers in the ardour of youth,
Selim the third was eager to undo all that his predecessor
had done; and scarce had his beard attained
a fortnight's growth,<sup id="r255"><a href="#n255">255</a></sup> when the two chief
favourites of his uncle, Youssoof and Hassan, were
suddenly removed from their exalted situations.
Some difference, however, marked the manner. Hassan's
age, his long services, and his former successes,
still inspired for the veteran hero a sort of habitual
veneration, which the new monarch durst not wholly
disregard. His disgrace was disguised under the
semblance of a new favour. While the Capitana
Bey,<sup id="r256"><a href="#n256">256</a></sup> Geretlu Husse&iuml;n, stepped into his place of
High Admiral, he rose to that of Beglier-bey of

<!-- vol 2 page 333 -->

Roumili: but, not only was he removed from what
seemed his proper element; he was commanded to
march as Seraskier of the army of Bessarabia, and
to recover the lost fortress of Ockzakow. Youssoof,
less rooted in the affections of the nation,
received a more unqualified dismissal. From the
rank of supreme Visier he was degraded to that
of Pasha of Widdin; Mobile, the more to envenom
the sting, the governor of that city, his inveterate
enemy, was raised in his place to the supreme
Visirate. This new commander in chief bore the
sirname of Djenaz&eacute;, or the dead, from the state
which his extreme ill health made him seem fast
approaching.</p>

<p>As to Mavroyeni, he experienced not any immediate
change in his situation. While danger was
rife and energy required, he could not be spared;
but the fall of his patron let loose all the forked
tongues of envy, and a store of accusations was laid
in, to be preferred against him at the first favourable
opportunity. In fact, there was not a crime or an
error which his enemies did not lay to his charge.
He had mismanaged matters of which ministers
never gave him the direction, embezzled sums
which the treasury never sent, and cut off heads,
not even for a moment absent from the shoulders
of their legitimate owners. Indeed, if truth lies
between the two extremes, he might be proved to
have been a perfect character, from labouring at

<!-- vol 2 page 334 -->

the same time under the most opposite and incompatible
charges; for he was at once rapacious
and profuse, timid and foolhardy, precipitate and
dilatory, too lenient and too severe, a bigot and
an infidel. But if therefore it seemed not so easy
to determine in what precisely consisted his guilt,
it was not the less evident that the punishment
was inevitable, and would be inflicted as soon as
the sentence, already pronounced <i>in petto</i>, could
safely be executed. Of this circumstance Mavroyeni
himself appeared fully sensible: and as in
every Greek who departed from Bucharest he beheld
an informer going to give fresh evidence
against him, so, in every Turk who arrived in
the place, he saw only a messenger of his disgrace.</p>

<p>Thus situated; knowing that, the instant his
principality was lost, he too must fall; and yet
hopeless of assistance from the new Visier,&mdash;rather
anxious for his discomfiture than eager for his success,
he exhausted all his private treasure in raising
at his own expense a fresh body of troops, and,
with what more men and ammunition he was able
to withdraw from the force at Fockshan, marched
to Rimnik, there to organise an attack to be made
the same day on all the passes into Transilvania:
hoping that, distracted by the multiplicity of points
to defend, the enemy might in some one or other
prove vulnerable. He himself undertook to conduct

<!-- vol 2 page 335 -->

the expedition against the pass of Temesch:
but whether the Austrians were informed of his
approach or only suspected his design, they met it
by so vigorous a sally from their lines, that, before
he could issue the final orders for a general attack,
he was repulsed and forced back with considerable
loss upon Gloyest. The scheme thus defeated ere
time had been given it to ripen, Mavroyeni recalled
his troops from the Hungarian confines, and returned
much dispirited to Rimnik, which henceforth
he made his head-quarters.</p>

<p>At the very outset of the affair of Temesch I had
been wounded in the thigh, by a ball not sufficiently
spent to save the bone from a tedious and painful
exfoliation. Thus disabled for some time from
serving, I left Rimnik, and returned to Bucharest,
whither the Bey's own surgeon&mdash;the only carver of
human limbs in the principality who knew a shin
bone from a drum-stick&mdash;was sent once or twice to
forward my cure.</p>

<p>In what way, soon after the minor events here
described, Coburg and the Austrians, twice threatened
by the Turks with annihilation, were twice
saved by the unexampled diligence and bravery of
Suwarrow, are events preserved from oblivion in the
imperishable annals of general history, and which
therefore I need not detail. Such at Rimnik was
the rout of the Turks, notwithstanding Djenaz&eacute; the
commander&mdash;too ill to sit on horseback&mdash;held up the

<!-- vol 2 page 336 -->

koran from his carriage, and ordered the cannon to
be fired on his own retreating troops, that the whole
Othoman camp fell into the hands of the enemy,
while the very course of the Danube became obstructed
by the number of waggons and corpses,
drowned in the Visier's flight across its ensanguined
tide.</p>

<p>For a considerable time before this decisive event,
Bucharest had been in that hopeless state&mdash;not devoid
perhaps of its peculiar luxury&mdash;in which people,
reckless of a future they may never witness, yield
without further restraint to every wildest suggestion
of the present moment, and, induced by the contemplation
of inevitable ruin, rush with premeditated
thoughtlessness into all the bold merriment of despair.
Men and women who never before had dared
to throw off the trammels of public opinion, and had
measured every movement, studied every gesture,
and settled every look, until it was become impossible
any longer to tell how nature had first moulded their
pliant metal, now resumed their original air, and
carriage, and tone; and now for the first time cast
away the irksome shackles of society, to display the
genuine bent of their character. No longer listening
to prudential considerations, which no longer could
repay the sacrifices they cost, the irascible now yielded
to their temper, the coarse to their brutality, the
malignant to their spite, the covetous to their love of
rapine, nay even the prudes to their longing for

<!-- vol 2 page 337 -->

open and unrestrained gallantry. I remember in
particular one lady, who, besieged by a numerous
troop of admirers, seemed, at the first opening of
the campaign, to defy every form of blockade or of
storm; but whose virtue exactly kept pace with the
events of the war. At every check our forces met
with, her severity relaxed: each battle lost removed
some former scruple; and the bulletins from the
army were the billet-doux in which her lovers might
read their chance of success. Unapproachable while
Youssoof's irruption in the Bannat was the theme
of every conversation; cold as ice during the attack
upon the Transilvanian passes, she began to
relent after the affair of Temesch: after the battle
of Fockshan she bade her lovers hope; and the
defeat of Rimnik became the signal for her unconditional
surrender&mdash;"She had not the presumption,"
she said, "to think, that, on the loss of a
province, the overthrow of her poor virtue could be
of any consequence!"</p>

<p>Equally modest were, on the score of their character,
most of Mavroyeni's courtiers: they deemed
their reputation full as little worth preserving as
the lady. The most straight forward conduct in
that respect was that of the Bey's own nephews, his
Grammaticus and his Cameraz. These two youths
agreed in conceiving that on their employments leaving
them, they might fairly leave their employer.
The only difference was in their mode of conducting

<!-- vol 2 page 338 -->

the process. When affairs began to look unpromising
the Grammaticus begged to resign his office; the Cameraz,
on the contrary, swore that he would never
ask to quit his benefactor. Nor did he:&mdash;for he
went without leave. If however some public personages
deserted the capital before the Prince thought
of moving, others, by way of compensation, stayed
very quietly when he went away. I mistake: as he
went out at one gate of the city to retire to Turkey,
his Boyars went out at the other, to meet and to
welcome the Austrians, who immediately after the
battle of Rimnik marched to his capital.</p>

<p>For my part, though I do not desire to boast of
my fidelity, and might have pleaded for staying,
the bad grace with which&mdash;owing to my still festering
wound&mdash;I must limp in the Bey's suite, I stupidly
followed my patron. My great fear was that
of seeing him miserably dejected, on quitting a
sovereignty which he had laboured so hard to
obtain: but in this I was agreeably disappointed.
After the depression produced by his successive
defeats, the bustle and excitement of the journey
rather caused in his spirits a sort of exhilaration.&mdash;"Who
ever ascended a throne," cried he, as we
went out at the gates, "to sit at his ease? Who,
that feared for his head, ever accepted a Sultan's
favours?&mdash;Come death when it may, I have lived
to be a Prince!"</p>

<p>This temper lasted till we reached the Danube.

<!-- vol 2 page 339 -->

Arrived in sight of that noble stream, which a few
years before he had crossed in the first bloom of his
grandeur, and which now again he was to cross in
the decline of his fortunes, stripped of all his dearly
purchased honours, a fugitive and a presumptive
criminal, Mavroyeni&mdash;prince as he had lived to be&mdash;paused,
cast back a wistful look, and, unable to tear
himself away at once from the object of his life's
long cherished schemes, refused to proceed further,
until informed that Coburg had actually entered his
capital. Bad news never lacks wings: he soon heard
how the victors had been hailed by the nobles of the
country; then bade his principality adieu for ever,
and stepped into the boat.</p>

<p>Out of evil sometimes comes good. Djenaz&eacute;,
with the battle of Rimnik, also lost the Visirate:
but, being called the dead already, Selim probably
thought it not worth while to take his life. Having,
however, in consequence of his lieutenant's reverses
and those of his other commanders, conceived a
surfeit of the war, the Sultan now conferred the
high office vacated on Hassan, our old Capitan-Pasha,
whose pacific dispositions suited his sovereign's
change of sentiments. Immediately on his
appointment the new visier proceeded to the head-quarters
at Schumlah, whither, with reviving hopes
and spirits, now likewise went Mavroyeni, to meet
his ancient master.</p>

<p>It would have delighted a stoic to see these two

<!-- vol 2 page 340 -->

old personages, who so well understood each other,
greet, and wag their beards together. Such, it is
said, was their emotion on first embracing, as absolutely
to force from their features of brass a few
iron tears. None however remain to confirm the
assertion. In fact, the Prince and the Pasha were
all in all to each other. To Hassan the assistance
of Mavroyeni seemed the pledge of diplomatic
success; while to Mavroyeni the support of Hassan
seemed positively as essential as physical existence.
But short, alas, was the joy! Hassan, like Moses,
had been destined to view from afar only the object
of all his wishes, the end of all his toils&mdash;the
long sought, and at last remotely glimmering peace.
Fate had ordained that he should not witness its
consummation. After a whole winter spent in
arduous and tiresome negotiations, an armistice was
only just agreed upon, when, on the twentieth of
March 1790 Ghazi Hassan, after a few hours illness,
ended as others do his long and brilliant career.
His enemies were accused of having shortened his
life;&mdash;but he was ninety when he died.</p>

<p>Of Hassan nothing now remains save his memory.
This however will endure in all its splendor
while the Turkish empire lasts. The single cloud<sup id="r257"><a href="#n257">257</a></sup>
which dims the setting sun cannot produce forgetfulness
of the many hours during which it shed its
undiminished radiance! As a youth, I witnessed
Hassan's expedition to the Morea. More matured,

<!-- vol 2 page 341 -->

I followed him in that to Egypt. His history,
his achievements exerted over my destinies that
remote but unceasing influence which the luminary
of the world exerts alike over all the living things
of the earth, whether he directly gladdens them
with his aspect, or whether, lighting up other
regions, he be hidden from their view. As I beheld
the meridian glory, so I beheld the last refulgence
of his dazzling career; and not only while
Hassan lived did my fate remain indirectly linked
to his fortunes, but even at his death did the
mournful chill which pervaded the empire extend
its benumbing influence to my remote and narrow
orbit. Of the brightness which he poured forth in
his zenith, a few beams had been reflected upon my
humble person, and the long shadow he left at his
decline, involved my fate likewise in its wide extending
darkness.</p>

<p>His demise again raised the hopes and views of
the party inclined for the war. A simple Aga of
Rustchook was appointed his successor, merely
because, many years before, this turbulent Moslemin
had contrived to raise a quarrel with prince
Repnin, when that nobleman passed through his
town as messenger of peace. Private animosity
was considered the pledge of military skill. I need
scarcely add, that in proportion as Hassan had been
a friend to Mavroyeni, Hassan's successor thought
himself bound to be his rancorous enemy: but

<!-- vol 2 page 342 -->

Mavroyeni had a secret enemy, not in the least distrusted
by him, far more dangerous than all that
stood confessed,&mdash;and this was himself.</p>

<p>The ever present foe in question&mdash;whose councils
uniformly prevailed over those of all his friends,&mdash;had
contrived by degrees wholly to estrange him
from his nephew Stephan, the then drogueman of
the fleet: and not without reason; inasmuch as
the said Stephanos&mdash;one of those anomalous beings,
who prefer the lower niches of office where unassuming
industry plods on unmolested, to its higher
pinnacles where ambition sits rocking in the lap of
danger&mdash;in order the better to watch the course
and to counteract the consequences of the intrigues
carried on against his uncle, had with unheard-of
obstinacy himself wholly abstained from intriguing;
and neither exhausted his strength in idle clamour,
nor exasperated his enemies by useless invective.</p>

<p>A behaviour so different from his own could not
but appear suspicious to that sagacious uncle:&mdash;he
determined that it should not avail his too moderate
nephew; and the man who never above nor ever
below the duties of his office, had seen Ghazi Hassan
succeeded in the command of the navy by Hassan of
Crete, and Hassan of Crete by Hussein the Georgian;
and had still under the minion of the Sultan as under
the idol of the people, preserved unimpaired and
unimpeached his fidelity towards his principals as
well as his devotion to his kindred, was by his

<!-- vol 2 page 343 -->

infatuated relation, in consideration of all his good
qualities, and in return for all his great services,
devoted to feel the last effects of his now almost
powerless animosity. What little wealth and influence
Mavroyeni still possessed, was destined by
him to purchase his nephew's disgrace&mdash;and, if
necessary, his death.</p>

<p>Frightened at this resolution, the execution of
which must render inevitable the ruin of the
prince and of all his adherents, I went to him, and
without much circumlocution set forth all the consequences
of his rash design. But, soured by disappointment,
Mavroyeni was become incapable of
dispassionate reasoning. He resembled one who,
while ascending a precipice and only looking upwards,
has proceeded on with a collected mind and
a firm and steady pace, but who, when again descending
he sees the whole abyss before him, grows
giddy, and from the very apprehension of danger,
plunges headlong into destruction. Offended at
my boldness, but unable to refute my arguments,
he only involved me in the ill-founded mistrust
which his faithful agent had incurred, and answered
my remonstrances with abuse. "You are all villains
alike;" cried he, foaming with rage.&mdash;"All engaged
in the same plot; all leagued against my life; all
watching open-mouthed for my expected spoil!"</p>

<p>My breath was not wasted in useless refutations

<!-- vol 2 page 344 -->

of so unmerited a reproach. I only stated that if
the prince persisted in obliging his enemies, by
removing the last prop of his house, his friends
must provide for their own safety;&mdash;and left him
to profit by the warning.</p>

<p>But to no purpose!&mdash;for he persisted in demanding
the dismissal of his nephew; and as the favour
he solicited was precisely of that description which
his bitterest enemies were the most anxious to see
realised, he soon obtained his wish. Stephan, his
relation and his friend, was dismissed, and, in order
that the change might be more sensibly felt, Handgerly,
who had pursued him with the most inveterate
hatred, was appointed in his nephew's place.</p>

<p>I would now have been fully justified in retiring
immediately; but two motives still operated to prolong
my stay:&mdash;some silly remains of attachment for
an old though unjust patron, and some reluctance
to resign my commission, just as the cure of my
wounds allowed me to resume my duty.</p>

<p>It is true my services seemed little likely to be
wanted any longer. The pacific influence which for
an instant was seen to hover over the Turkish councils
had winged its way northward, and had settled
permanently on those of Austria. Joseph the second,
the author of the war&mdash;who, through his ill judged
mode of enforcing designs salutary in themselves,
had driven to open rebellion all his dominions from

<!-- vol 2 page 345 -->

the Danube to the Scheld&mdash;Joseph the second was
no more! After quenching the flame he had raised,
by cancelling at one stroke on his death-bed all the
toilsome reforms of his whole life, he had resigned
his breath under the pressure of every public calamity
and private distress, which could embitter
the last moments of a man replete at once with
pride and feeling; and Leopold, his brother and
his successor, reluctantly transferred from the peaceful
banks of the Arno to all the storms that raged
round the Imperial throne, had already infused
among the Austrian troops a spirit so different,
that, during the whole of the summer, they contented
themselves with quietly looking at the Turks
across the Danube; when, unluckily, the Pasha of
Widdin&mdash;the ever restless Youssoof&mdash;mistook this
desire of tranquillity for a proof of weakness, and
determined with his own forces and those of Mavroyeni,
to dislodge the enemy from his neighbourhood.
He summoned the Bey to join him with his
remaining troops; and the Bey came at his call.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of August Youssoof ordered
Mavroyeni's division to pass the river; intending&mdash;as
soon as this detachment should be sufficiently
intrenched near the village of Kalafath, by which
it was covered&mdash;to follow with the remainder of his
army, higher up the stream; so as to place the enemy
between two fires. But the uncourteous enemy
suffered not this scheme to ripen, and advancing unperceived

<!-- vol 2 page 346 -->

in the night, attacked us on the twenty-sixth
of the month, at dawn of day, with very
superior numbers. It is true that, by availing myself
of some high ground which we commanded to
turn the flank of the Austrians and to fall upon
their rear, I made them believe for a moment that
our plan had succeeded, and that Youssoof himself
was giving them chase: but this diversion came too
late, and was too trifling to save us. Already were
the Austrians in full possession of our lines.</p>

<p>Amid the scene of carnage which ensued, dare I
introduce the fate of a flesh-pot, which, humble as
seems the object, yet, by the vicissitudes it experienced,
forms a remarkable episode in the general
picture? Time out of mind this capacious utensil
had been the solace, the rallying point, the support
of a most respectable oda<sup id="r258"><a href="#n258">258</a></sup> of jenissaries. The
members of this division were trailing away the
ample vessel with all the celerity which its unaccommodating
shape and unwieldy size permitted, when,
as it majestically retreated in all its unbending sturdiness
before the advancing enemy, surrounded by
its whole troop of ministers and satellites, from the
Astshee-bashee or head-cook of the orta down to
the lowest regimental scullery-boy, it happened to
be spied by a knot of Austrian hussars. With them
to see was to covet. Immediately they determined
to effect its conquest; while the regiment which
boasted its property showed equal determination to

<!-- vol 2 page 347 -->

defend to the last drop of its blood, what so often
had sustained the life and renovated the vigour of
its members. The conflict therefore was long and
sanguinary. At one time the Austrians seemed
victors, at another the Turks again recovered the
highly prized utensil; and not until the unresisting
victim of the fierce contest, now hauled one way,
now pulled the other, had witnessed the fall of all
its Moslem defenders, did it pass from the hands of
the faithful into those of the infidels; but with a face
as round, and sleek, and brazen as ever; unmindful
of the streams of blood spilt in its behalf, and little
seeming to care itself who filled its ample belly, or
kindled the accustomed fire under its enormous base.</p>

<p>Ye who value words more than things, look not
with contempt upon this scene of what may pass
in your minds for misapplied heroism! Learn that
the very fundamental organisation of the jenissaries
renders the vessel, in which are cooked their daily
rations, the rallying point of each regiment&mdash;the
token whose loss casts a lasting dishonour upon
those to whom it belonged: and that, provided the
common soldier has a something of which he connects
the defence with his individual fame, it signifies
little whether it be a copper vessel, or a piece of
painted silk; an eagle or a flesh-pot.</p>

<p>My division had suffered the least in our defeat.
I therefore led it back round the village to protect
the re-embarking of the other troops; but could not

<!-- vol 2 page 348 -->

prevent a scene of indescribable confusion. Hundreds
of wretches, unable to reach the craft collected
on the river, plunged headlong into the stream, and
there found the death they had escaped in the intrenchments.
The number of the drowned exceeded
that of the slain. Several boats full of soldiers were
sunk on the passage; a cannon-ball went right
through the barge which conveyed the prince; and,
had it struck the frail skiff half a second sooner,
must have ended his fate in the Danube: but
Mavroyeni was not born to be drowned!</p>

<p>Having with a handful of arnaoots remained the
very last on the hostile side of the river, I expected
to be completely cut off for want of conveyance,
and to have drunk the sherbet of martyrdom, little
as it was to my taste&mdash;when at some distance I perceived
a raft moored among some rushes, which thus
far had escaped all observation. I pointed it out to
three or four of my best men, and with them jumped
on board and pushed it off. Paddling towards the
Turkish shore we soon became a conspicuous mark,
and were treated accordingly. Luckily the current
quickly carried us a good way down the stream,
and, though many balls whizzed over our heads,
none entered very deep into our bodies. The worst
remembrances they left me to carry back to Turkey
were a couple of flesh wounds. Even these, it is
true, I could willingly have dispensed with, in spite
of the delicious odour which the koran asserts to

<!-- vol 2 page 349 -->

exhale from wounds produced by infidel weapons;
and particularly, as the Turks show themselves too
resigned to the will of Providence, to bring in the
suite of their armies men so hostile to the awards of
fate as surgeons.</p>

<p>Youssoof had set his heart on his long planned
<i>coup de main</i>. The failure of our preparatory movements
did not prevent him from attempting it two
days after; and the only use he made of our defeat
was to excuse his own. The whole blame of Youssoof's
discomfiture fell upon Mavroyeni, and a long
list of complaints against the prince reached the
Porte from the frontier, just as Handgerly had been
raking up in the capital the old story of the seraff
Petracki, and representing Mavroyeni as possessed
of all the treasure lost to the Sultan by the execution
of his cashier. Blows so dire, struck in such rapid
succession, seemed to render the prince's ruin inevitable.
Each effort he had made to recover his lost
ground had only caused him to fall another step;
and it appeared as if fate had been intent only to
lead him from one misfortune to another so gradually,
as, without breaking his proud spirit at
once, to bend it by little and little completely to the
ground.</p>

<p>Unequivocal signs of the utmost depression of
mind showed themselves more and more every day,
amidst all his unsuccessful attempts to keep up his
lofty manner. The supernatural informer with

<!-- vol 2 page 350 -->

whom in more prosperous days he used to threaten
others, he had himself begun to believe in, nay, to
dread: for, from a good genius the familiar spirit
seemed by degrees to have grown into an avenging
demon, who pursued his own employer by day and
by night. Fixing his haggard eyes on vacancy the
prince would sometimes, as in a fit of raving, address
the invisible fiend, beg a truce to his fancied
persecutions, or enter into a regular defence of the
conduct he had held in his government: and once,
in the middle of a numerous circle, as he was giving
way to the transient somnolency which of late frequently
overpowered his senses and afforded a short
respite from the goadings of his mind, I experienced
the unspeakable horror of seeing him&mdash;after some
time moving his lips like one engaged in secret converse&mdash;at
last start up convulsively from his seat,
wildly open his eyes, and exclaim in a voice of
thunder: "Hellish spirit, you lie! It is not I
who did it:&mdash;it is not I who burnt the empty barn,
feigned to have been full of corn: nor I who
charged pay for the deserters, never estranged
from their sovereign: nor I who buried in a bean
field the military chest, captured in my despatches
by a troop of hulans: nor I who poisoned the
cup . . . . ."</p>

<p>Here my outstretched hand, falling on my patron's
lips, at last succeeded to stop the frightful current
of his words. I dragged him forcibly out of the

<!-- vol 2 page 351 -->

room; and might perhaps have succeeded by degrees
to quiet him, but for his ghostly director,
who unfortunately determined this once to assert
his office, and recommended to the prince to say his
prayers. The moment was ill chosen: "Cursed
priest," cried the Bey, "how can my words hope
to rise, when you see the vampire wings, that flap to
beat them down again!"</p>

<p>The day after this scene I was sent for to the
prince's closet: he seemed then quite composed.
"Selim," said he, "my hour of fate approaches.
It would be foolish to suppose that I could much
longer avert the evil day. I therefore wish you to
tell me with your accustomed candour which you
think most for my glory: to take the business into
my own hands, and by a death that may seem the
result of my own choice, to balk my persecutors of
their expected triumph; or, with a calmness and
fortitude perhaps more difficult than a precipitate
suicide, to await the executioner?"</p>

<p>"Sir," answered I gravely, "we all know that
a king, a general, a statesman may, without the
smallest scruple, sacrifice to a mistaken piece of
policy, a foolish pique or a silly point of honour, as
many unwilling victims as the magnitude of the object
shall require. In the like manner we are told
that even a private gentleman may part with a
fraction of his own body&mdash;an arm, a leg, or both,&mdash;provided
it be to secure greater durability to the

<!-- vol 2 page 352 -->

parts preserved. We are even assured by grave
divines, that both potentates and private individuals
may make themselves defunct on earth to every
social duty, by becoming monks or anchorets&mdash;and
be highly praised for the deed: but, however troublesome
a man's existence may be to himself and to
others; however greatly his voluntary removal might
oblige all the world; however much his death would
be a private and a public benefit, none dare dispose
of their sum total of life, or remove their entire being
from a worse to a better world. This act, which
might do the performer much good, and could injure
no one else, is of all crimes the most heinous."</p>

<p>"Pshaw," cried Mavroyeni, "I did not call you
in for the purpose of retailing to me the commonplace
cant either of Christians or of Mohammedans,&mdash;which
latter perhaps would have added that, as
the hour of death is written on our foreheads, we
are not able to hasten it, if so inclined. I sent to
consult you, as a man who, encumbered with the
prejudices of neither creed, would honestly tell me
which of the two steps left for me to choose between
was likely to figure most handsomely in history.
Ancient heroes have been praised for dying without
the least necessity; modern worthies for resigning
themselves to live without the smallest hopes: and
I cannot make up my mind to which will look best
in the eyes of the world!"</p>

<p>"To live, beyond all doubt!" cried I.&mdash;"The

<!-- vol 2 page 353 -->

living every where figure better than the dead!
Besides, it is the fashion of the country, which no
one should despise. People will only suspect some
low born rascal or some low bred disease of having
envied you the honour of the Sultan's bowstring;
and the witnesses of your heroism may only be
hanged as the authors of your death!"</p>

<p>Mavroyeni still preserved a lurking love for life.
Not only he resigned himself to the remnant left
him; but, in order to render that remnant more
secure, he even determined to remove it out of
Youssoof's reach.</p>

<p>Again was I going to trudge after my patron.
He had indeed forfeited all claims upon the loyalty
of his adherents, by his wanton perverseness in increasing
their dangers; but still it went against my
feelings to leave him in his fallen state. So far,
however, from appearing thankful for this devotion,
he now, to my utter astonishment, began to consider
it as an importunity: "He had seen me," he said,
"much distinguished by Youssoof: he knew I was
the Pasha's spy; and the last and only service I still
could render a once kind and indulgent master&mdash;to
whom I still owed some obedience,&mdash;was to withdraw
for ever from his presence!"</p>

<p>The wished-for opportunity of distinguishing myself
once more, and of earning among men an honourable
name, ere I left the prince and the army

<!-- vol 2 page 354 -->

for ever, I had found at Kalafath. When therefore
I found the reproaches for not departing according
to my promise daily repeated, I resolved at last
to go. Watching a moment of comparative serenity
in Mavroyeni's temper, I entered his chamber, kissed
his hand, and begged his commands for the capital.</p>

<p>At these words he turned pale; and looked as
much aghast as if there never had been any question
of my leaving him.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "did you not yourself, only yesterday,
upbraid me for staying?"</p>

<p>"Ah," cried he, "could you then take at his
word, one maddened by the misfortunes heaped
upon him!" Then, rising from his seat, and wildly
pacing the room:&mdash;"My affairs must be desperate
indeed," continued he, "since it is come to this!"&mdash;but
again sitting down, as if ashamed of betraying
so much weakness, "No!" exclaimed he in a calmer
tone, "the Sultan knows all that I have done for
the empire; he cannot desire my annihilation!"</p>

<p>I tried to confirm the Bey in this more soothing
idea, and fancied he had recovered some tranquillity,
when again he broke out with more violence than
before. "It is useless," he cried, "any longer to
conceal from you my state. A dreadful gloom oppresses
my soul. Spectres of all descriptions unceasingly
hover around my steps: they assume every
most frightful shape. At this very moment one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;a

<!-- vol 2 page 355 -->

whole host, whisper in my ear every
dire and dreadful presage!"</p>

<p>"And is there among them no angel of light,"
cried I, "to tell your highness that by speeding to
the capital, I may perhaps retrieve your fortunes?
You know, sir, my ancient intimacy with young
Mavrocordato; his influence with his father; the
relationship of that father with Handgerly; the
connexion of the latter with the Souzzos;&mdash;as well
as the riches, the ambition, the sway of Mavrocordato
the elder. Long has he aspired at the principality;
and some compromise might be made by
which his interest and his fortune should be employed
to secure your life, on condition of your
ceding to him, on the return of peace, all your still
subsisting claims upon Valachia."</p>

<p>This expedient was but a straw: the falling prince
caught at it greedily; and now pressed me himself to
go, in order to put the scheme into execution. After
sending for me but the week before, in order to discuss
the propriety of seeking death by his own hands,
he now conjured me to do all I could to save his life.</p>

<p>Yet, when I came to bid him farewell, he hardly
would permit me to depart. Laying on my hand
his cold and clammy palm, "Selim, Selim!" cried
he, as if oppressed with anguish, "you who have
known me from your youth; who have ever found
me indulgent and kind, save when you rejected my
kindness; over whom I ever kept a watchful eye,

<!-- vol 2 page 356 -->

even when you thought I had justly abandoned
you; henceforth make me the only return in your
power: allow not those things to be imputed to my
weakness, which were only the result of my necessities.
When my conduct in my principality is canvassed,
recall to mind my means. What I have
done, say with what I did it; and, when the rest of
the world shall unite to condemn me, remember your
ancient patron, and dare to defend his memory."</p>

<p>I felt moved, and was on the point of giving up
the journey. But what good could my stay produce?
I therefore gently disembarrassed my hand from the
Bey's almost convulsive grasp, and said, "I was sure
I still should see him triumph over all his enemies."</p>

<p>"It shall be," replied he, a little calmer, "as
Heaven ordains. To myself my warning spirit
whispers&mdash;my days draw to their close. Go thou
and prosper!"</p>

<p>I went;&mdash;but prospered not!</p>

<p>Mavroyeni, though he immediately quitted the
vicinity of Widdin, removed not to a great distance.
His first station was Arvanito-chori, a mean village:
but constantly shifting his quarters from one place
to another, as if to elude pursuit, he still kept
hovering over the borders of his principality&mdash;like
the moth which with wings already singed still flies
around the candle; but at every circle narrows
more and more its orbit, until it pitches on the spot
marked for its final fate.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 357 -->

<p>To Mavroyeni this spot was Bella. There it was
that suddenly appeared before the Bey, no longer a
mere airy phantom, but the capidjee of flesh and
blood, commissioned to confer upon him the palm of
martyrdom.<sup id="r259"><a href="#n259">259</a></sup> Mavroyeni had kept in reserve, when
all other means should fail, an expedient on which
he placed implicit reliance. "My firm conviction"&mdash;said
he to the Sultan's messenger&mdash;"has always
been that a good Christian must be a bad subject.
For how can he show zeal for his sovereign and his
country, whose religion enjoins entire detachment
from this nether world? I therefore have long inwardly
bowed to the truth of Islamism; and now
only wish publicly to embrace its holy law, and to
be numbered among the faithful."</p>

<p>Upon this the prince took from his bosom a small
koran, which he carried on purpose, kissed it devoutly,
and desired to make his profession of faith.
Such a request even a capidjee durst not deny him:
he was suffered to perform at his full leisure his
orisons, his genuflections, and his ablutions; and not
until all was concluded did the capidjee express his
satisfaction at being now enabled to send to heaven
so sincere a believer.</p>

<p>What could be done? No enthusiastic mob here
pressed around to take under its protection a young
and pitied neophyte. Before the hoary sinner stood
no one but his cold-blooded executioner, intent only
upon the performance of his office. Seeing all further

<!-- vol 2 page 358 -->

subterfuge therefore useless, Mavroyeni at last armed
himself with becoming resolution, and determined
quietly to submit to his fate. Yet could he not, as
he knelt down, help exclaiming: "I deserved other
thanks, at least from my sovereign! May he, in his
wide extended realms, find a Greek more faithful!"
He said no more, uncovered his neck, suffered the
fatal bowstring to be fastened round his throat&mdash;and
fell a corpse.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> my destinies never enabled me to shine forth
like the rarer suns of the creation, with any inherent
splendor of my own; if my vagrant disposition never
allowed me even to reflect with steadiness the borrowed
lustre of a regular satellite; if at all times I
rather resembled in my desultory rambles the erratic
comet, either so near some nobler orb as to be lost in
its blaze, or so remote from every star in the firmament
as to be abandoned to its own native obscurity,
still had I thus far in my career shone at
intervals with some little radiance derived from the
reflection of loftier names: but this resource now
ceases; this passport to public notice henceforth
is denied me. Hassan and Mavroyeni already are
no more; and if Youssoof, by concluding the war
which he kindled, still claims a page in history's
weightier volume, he no longer comes within the
compass of this desultory sketch. Nor will other
luminaries arise to succeed these setting stars.
Whatever instruments of great changes or workers
of great mischief may still appear, will move in an

<!-- vol 2 page 360 -->

orbit so distant from my reader's view, as scarcely
to preserve in his eyes any impressive size. Henceforth
I shall constantly have to thrust my own insignificant
person foremost on the stage; and to
draw from my own lowly though sad vicissitudes
alone, all my means of interesting or attaching my
readers.</p>

<p>Nor is the want of great names, in whose brighter
radiance to walk, the only growing disadvantage of
these pages. The humbler person on whom henceforth
exclusively devolves the task of occupying the
reader's attention, must even be resigned to lose, as
the work advances, the faint halo which might thus
far have appertained to his own person. He no
longer can expect to retain that power of exciting
the interest, or of obtaining the favour or the forgiveness
of the world, which might have been hoped
for at the commencement of this confession. In its
earlier chapters the discourse was concerning a raw
stripling,&mdash;a youth hurried away by the restlessness
of his incipient being: and the immaturity of adolescence,
as it enhances the merit of what is good,
so it engages to view with indulgence what is reprehensible.
Of the faults of a boy the greater number
are ascribed to his newness in the world, to his not
yet being initiated in its manifold mysteries, to his
not yet distrusting its older and warier tenants.
The graces of youth secure the forgiveness of more
advanced age: but that happy era, that period of

<!-- vol 2 page 361 -->

delightful dreams once gone by, no more mercy must
be looked for. Every action is considered as the result
of a character formed, of a deliberate will:&mdash;it
is scanned with minuteness, and it is judged with
severity. If it betray the smallest error, not only
the deed is condemned, but the author is pursued
by man's implacable hatred. "Of one so confirmed
in evil an example is all that can be made;" exclaims
an unsympathising world: and where the
Anastasius of sixteen might have obtained a full and
unqualified pardon for his transgressions, the Anastasius
of twenty-eight must expect to meet with all
the rigour of unmitigated justice.</p>

<p>If therefore my pen only laboured for others,
here is the place where it should find repose: but I
write for myself&mdash;and I proceed! The very incidents
which, more confined to my own individual
self may have less merit in the eyes of strangers,
are those which my mind oftener recalls, and dwells
upon with most complacency.</p>

<p>"The more haste, the less speed," says the
proverb; and the proverb speaks true. So anxious
was I, on leaving Widdin, to get to Stambool, that
my hurry forced me to stop short in the middle of my
race. Still weak on setting out, and unprovided with
Mohammed's angel wings to screen me from the
scorching sun, I was overcome by heat and fatigue
early on the journey, and fell ill at Boorgas. What
I hated more than Jews do pork or gunpowder,&mdash;attendants

<!-- vol 2 page 362 -->

and gallipots,&mdash;now again beset me.
Wholly defenceless, I was assailed by half a dozen
physicians and nurses at once. They took forcible
possession of my apartment, and waged over my
body as fierce a contest as ever Greeks and Trojans
maintained over that of Patroclus. In truth, this
was lucky; for my safety only lay in numbers. The
sons of &AElig;sculapius and the daughters of Hygeia
neutralized each others schemes; and I escaped, like
a small district wedged in between greater powers,
which owes its preservation to their unceasing rivalship.
The first tranquil slumber which I had enjoyed
since my malady, was broken by the stray
blows that fell from the hands of the two trusty
persons hired to watch by my bed, as they were
engaged across my pillow in a scuffle for my purse.
Each tried to gloss over his own conduct, by accusing
the other of having come to murder me.</p>

<p>Fresh from witnessing events of some importance,
it was during my convalescence that I first bethought
myself of relieving its tedium by writing my memoirs.
"They must"&mdash;thought I&mdash;"if consonant
to truth, speak too ill of their author, not to be
sure of finding readers;" and that idea encouraged
me to begin the execution of the arduous design.
I am not even certain whether&mdash;though wishing
never to deviate from the most scrupulous veracity&mdash;I
have not sometimes, out of respect for the
public taste, made myself somewhat worse than the

<!-- vol 2 page 363 -->

world gave me credit for being. If any of my
readers should entertain a suspicion of that sort,
I leave it to his own discretion to adopt or to reject
it:&mdash;I shall quarrel with him for neither.</p>

<p>When sufficiently recovered, I proceeded to the
capital and visited the Fanar; but no longer, as I
had intended, to make interest for Mavroyeni. His
cares in this world were over ere I quitted Boorgas;
and I had no other object but to afford my friends
and well-wishers an opportunity of realizing the
warm professions lavished upon me at my departure
for Valachia. It would be unfair to say they were
wholly denied or forgotten. One person, whom I
reminded of his promises, observed that he had
pledged himself in much stronger terms than those
which I quoted:&mdash;but to whom? To one going to
join Mavroyeni in the plenitude of his power.
"Now, prove yourself at this present speaking to
be that man," he added, "and you shall find me
stanch to my word." I applauded the frankness
of this answer. There was a delicacy in not wishing
to wheedle me by empty words out of an esteem,
which there was a firm determination not to deserve
by friendly actions.</p>

<p>The filth of the Fanar now displayed to me all its
lustre:&mdash;it was like the contents of a sewer, when
through a chink in the vault the sun darts its beams
full upon their unsightly stream; and much did the
nauseous spectacle increase my veneration for the

<!-- vol 2 page 364 -->

wisdom of the Turks! "Sensible, sagacious, profound
people," thought I, "how much your judgment
is to be admired, in simplifying as you do all
your dealings with the Greeks! Powerful as you
may fancy your grasp, still, if after catching those
serpents you only allowed them to writhe in your
hands, they would infallibly slip through your fingers,
dart back into their native slime, and elude your
sharpest search. Were you to employ with that
deceitful race the slow and circumspect mode of
judicial proceeding to which the squeamishness of
Christendom attaches such importance, your indolence,
your credulity&mdash;your <i>bonhomie</i>, if I may call
it so&mdash;would never get the better of their artifice
and subterfuges: you would never be able to follow
and to lay hold of them in their endless turnings and
windings; and, with the moral certainty of being imposed
upon by every individual of that wily nation,
you must submit contentedly to be cheated out of
every para of your property, and every inch of
your estates. But, wise and judicious people! far
more securely do you go to work. In your fiscal
administration you scorn those innumerable offices,
and checks, and verifications which in each empire
in Christendom, for every ten individuals directly
engaged in collecting the revenue, employ twenty
others to watch those ten, and thus consume half the
income of the state in the collecting of the other half.
In the same way in your judicial proceedings you

<!-- vol 2 page 365 -->

waive those endless forms, and ministers, and tribunals;
those interminable interrogatories, and scrutinies,
and confrontations, which in each state in
Europe busy half the population about the rights and
misdemeanours of the other half, let nine offenders
out of ten escape, and often inflict on the tenth only
a tardy and inadequate punishment. Sometimes,
indeed, through your peremptory mode of proceeding
you mistake the innocent for the guilty:&mdash;but
what of that!&mdash;You are always sure at least of attaining
the greatest aim of all penal justice, that of
striking the mind with a salutary terror!</p>

<p>"Nor should <i>You</i>, in this my humble panegyric,
lack your proper share of praise, wise and noble
Sultan, holy vicar of the prophet, Imperial Manslayer!<sup id="r260"><a href="#n260">260</a></sup>
entitled every day to cut off lawfully fourteen
heads, without assigning any reason for their
fall:&mdash;you, who, by making an implicit obedience to
your will the express condition of every public employment
throughout your vast empire, have secured
yourself against losing the smallest part of
your prerogative, through any delay, however great,
in its exercise. Regarding each officer of the state
only in the light of one of the smaller and more
numerous reservoirs, distributed on more distant
points of your domain to receive at first hand the
produce of dews, and drip, and rills, ere the collective
mass be poured into the single greater central basin
of your all absorbing treasury, you give yourself

<!-- vol 2 page 366 -->

no trouble to check the dishonesty, or to prevent
the peculations of your agents. You rather for
a while connive at, and favour, and lend your own
authority to his exactions, which will enable you,
when afterwards you squeeze him out, to combine
greater gain with a more signal show of justice. In
permitting a temporary defalcation from your treasury,
you consider yourselves as only lending out
your capital at higher interest. Nine long years,
while your work is done for you gratuitously, you
feign to sleep, and the tenth you awake from your
deceitful trance; like the roused lion you look
round where grazes the fattest prey, stretch your
ample claw, crush your devoted victim, and make
every drop of his blood, so long withheld from your
appetite, at last flow into the capacious bowels of your
insatiable hazn&eacute;!"</p>

<p>But the more I admired the system as a mere
indifferent spectator, the less I felt inclined to
illustrate its principles by my own example. Having
already with such infinite toil and danger&mdash;at the
cost of my repose and my health&mdash;devoted so great
a portion of that life that fleets away so fast, to
climbing the rugged and slippery path of distinction,
in order every time I thought I had attained a certain
height, only again to slide back to the point
from whence I first started with equal rapidity, I
determined no longer to sacrifice to the same thankless
task what still might remain mine of health and of

<!-- vol 2 page 367 -->

vigour. Instead of the vain sound of titles and the
unsubstantial advantages of rank, I determined to
seek the more lasting and more tangible prerogatives
of a well filled purse, and, by the laudable appetite
for solid gold, to drive out of my mind the depraved
thirst for mere unsubstantial fame. "The
way to honours," cried I in my new species of enthusiasm,
"is a steep and narrow path where few
can ascend abreast, and those that follow only try
to push down and to pass by the foremost. It is a
path which can only be pursued by arduous and
abrupt leaps; while at every higher step the risk
of stumbling and being dashed to pieces increases
in a tenfold ratio. It is a path where distances ever
deceive, and what from below appeared the highest
summit, when attained, only is found the base of
still loftier crags, bearing fruits still more empty
and bitter to the taste! But the way to wealth,"
exclaimed I, "is a wide acclivity, accessible to all
without danger or fatigue: it is a road along which
you may to a nicety calculate the progress made,
and the chance of further advancement; where
success depends not on the caprice and favour of
patrons, but on the exertions of the wayfarer himself;
where, as his way proceeds, he rests on a wider
and more solid foundation, finds greater helps still
to rise on, and yet needs them less; it is a road, in
fine, along which such fruits only are gathered, as

<!-- vol 2 page 368 -->

purchase or comprehend all the tangible blessings
which man values here below!"</p>

<p>In this new view of things, I soon laid down my
plan of future conduct. While in Valachia Mavroyeni
made his harvest, I had been gleaning in his
suite. Formerly, in my soberest moods, I would
have hastened to get rid at least of half my ready
cash, and contented myself with leaving the other
half slowly to beget a puny progeny. But this
suited not my present temper. Each of my thousands
was in time to grow to a million; and with
millions in question, the difference of one half seemed
too great an object to trifle with.</p>

<p>Now therefore behold Selim&mdash;the gay, the extravagant,
the dissipated Selim&mdash;all at once transformed
into a plodding financier; as much on the
watch to turn a para as formerly he had been
on the alert for every means to spend his purses;
carefully calculating the interest of each incoming
piastre, and deeply groaning after each outgoing
aspre: no longer only seeking to dispose of his
capital in the way which should give the least trouble,
but racking his brains to place his funds in the mode
best fitted to secure that grand desideratum&mdash;that
sort of philosopher's stone&mdash;perfect security, combined
with exorbitant interest: no longer inquiring,
when introduced to a stranger, whether he was a
pleasant companion, but whether he passed for a man

<!-- vol 2 page 369 -->

of substance, orderly in his affairs and punctual in
his payments: lamenting the insecurity of investments,
the badness of the times, and the high price of
provisions; voting servants a pest; looking with pity
on the extravagant youths of the age, who preferred
gold lace on their backs to gold pieces in their
girdle; lending them money at fifty per cent out of
pure charity; wondering how any body could seek
in his attire and equipage the short lived merits of
novelty and fashion, rather than the lasting recommendations
of costing little and wearing well, and&mdash;strange
to tell&mdash;as proud of a cautious demure look,
a smug jacket without binding, and a single half-starved
waiting-boy, as ever he had been of a giddy
hare-brained manner, clothes stiff with embroidery,
and insolent pampered servants, more supercilious
than their master.</p>

<p>In a cool, sedate, reflective person, so entire a
change of tastes and of behaviour, I suppose, could
not have taken place so suddenly. It could only
have been the work of time, and would have displayed
a graduated progress. But I possessed not
that even temperature of mind which steers clear of
extremes: I never could do any thing in moderation.
However different might become the object
of pursuit, the ardour of the chase with me still
remained the same; and the greater the impetus
with which I had rushed on in any direction, the
stronger, when I met with a check, became the

<!-- vol 2 page 370 -->

recoil in the opposite direction. My soul fired at the
recent instances I had witnessed in Mavrocordato
and others, of immense fortunes made in trade; and,
already in love with wealth on its own account, I
doubly reverenced it in view of the power obtainable
through its influence: for ambition would never leave
me entirely quiet, but, when it was turned out of
doors, stole in at the window, and added its persuasions
to the other motives which had determined me
before to become a first-rate merchant. So fast
galloped my imagination, that already I saw myself
standing with one leg in Cashmere, and with the other
in St. Domingo; with the right hand loading hemp
at St. Petersburg, and with the left gold and negroes
on the Guinea coast; and covering with my vessels
at once the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, the
Euxine and the South Sea.&mdash;I had genius; I could,
if I chose, force perseverance; and the only trifles
wanted were capital, credit, and correspondents.</p>

<p>Providence had just kept in store for me the only
person, ready to hold all these desiderata at my disposal
on the shortest notice. I found every thing
needful in an old Moslemin, grown enormously rich
through nothing but his undeviating perseverance
to do all that, by common calculation, ought to have
reduced him to beggary. In the true spirit of predestination,
Welid maintained that no mode of conduct
begot ill-luck so infallibly as caution. "It
manifested mistrust," he said, "in the ways of Providence;

<!-- vol 2 page 371 -->

and one single pious ejaculation at the outset
of an enterprise was worth all the calculations of
worldly wisdom." Indeed Welid might quote his
whole life in proof of this doctrine.</p>

<p>But&mdash;to go no further back in the recapitulation
than the instances of the last twelvemonth:&mdash;the
Porte had sent away for riotous behaviour the Sclavonians
who do the garden work about Constantinople,
just at that period of the spring when the
setting fruits require constant irrigation. All Welid's
neighbours strained every nerve to supply the deficiency,
while Welid alone saw the pining of his
oranges, his citrons and his pumpkins with perfect
apathy, and only exclaimed, "God is great!"&mdash;What
was the consequence? The sky, usually of
brass in that season, all at once opened its sluices,
and made Welid's <i>agrumi</i>, on the very brink of
annihilation, yield a double crop.</p>

<p>Again: the unusual rains, in the hottest month
of the year, had produced a dreadful plague. Most
of Welid's friends took some precautions against the
infection, while Welid alone seemed by preference to
go where the malady was rifest, and only repeated,
"God is great!"&mdash;What ensued? Not a finger of
Welid's ached all the time; but he became heir to
every one of his relations who had evinced more
prudence.</p>

<p>And again: the dampness of the summer was
followed by an autumn so dry, that every night

<!-- vol 2 page 372 -->

saw Constantinople disturbed by some dreadful conflagration.
Several of Welid's acquaintance therefore
watched their premises, while Welid heard the
cry of yan-guen-var<sup id="r261"><a href="#n261">261</a></sup> in his very yard, without saying
any thing but "God is great!"&mdash;How did the
business end? Welid's house indeed was burnt to
the ground: but the falling walls discovered a deposit
of gold and jewels sufficient to build a score of
palaces.</p>

<p>What therefore could be more natural than for
Welid to infer that the more imprudences he committed,
the less he could fail to prosper? Nor did
he lack examples of the mischiefs arising from a
more wary conduct, for&mdash;not to mention his own
brother, who, with a sincere and heartfelt wish for
wealth, had, from the mere apprehension of making
a bad hit, never made a good one; nor his nephew,
who, grudging a servant's wages, had in his loneliness
been murdered by a band of robbers; nor his
cousin, who, to save his old vessel a scouring, had
sold his gold for brass,&mdash;what but Emin's resorting
to medicine in a malady from which he might have
recovered, had made him take a deadly poison?
What but Talib's fear of a pursuing foe had caused
him to fall into a torrent, and be drowned? And
what but Nasser's inventing a most ingenious trap
for thieves, had kept him confined by the leg in his
own fetters, until he died of hunger amidst all his
dearly purchased treasure?</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 373 -->

<p>The vast fortune which Welid had by his imprudence
acquired, I advised him to employ in some
grand speculation, and to make me his partner in
the concern. Others might not have thought me
the fittest person for a commercial associate, but I
repeated Allah-kierim<sup id="r262"><a href="#n262">262</a></sup> until Welid committed all
his affairs to my management. We went, he, his
son, and myself, to Smyrna; there freighted a vessel
with cotton, and resolved to carry our merchandize
to Marseilles, where we could not fail to find a good
market. As I contributed but little toward the
purchase, my portion was to be but small in the
profits: this however remained a tacit clause between
us, too well understood to be expressed. No
regular account, no legal vouchers, no written memorandum
whatever was drawn up of our respective
shares. Welid was not a man to trouble himself
about such formalities. "Each knew his own," he
said, "and that was enough."</p>

<p>In one respect, however, he showed an invincible
obstinacy. He had taken it into his head that it
would be manifesting his trust in Providence, to
hire the first vessel he should meet with. This
happened to be precisely the oldest and craziest
concern in the harbour; a thing on the eve of being
broken up, as unfit for service. The circumstance,
however, so far from deterring, only confirmed
Welid in his purpose. He thought it a most fortunate
opportunity of signalizing his reliance on

<!-- vol 2 page 374 -->

heaven, and no entreaty or remonstrance could
make him desist from freighting this miserable
wreck, in preference to a dozen stout vessels disengaged.
He would not even insure. It was
flying in the face of Providence, and almost as bad
as atheism or blasphemy; so that, unable to persuade
my partner, I had insurance made in my own
name on the whole cargo.</p>

<p>We now set sail. Hardly had we got into the
latitude of Chios, when Welid's son&mdash;as hale a boy
to all appearance as ever was seen&mdash;suddenly fell
ill, and died. Our crew, chiefly Proven&ccedil;als, doubted
not his being a victim to the plague, which had
begun to spread in Smyrna; and became almost
petrified with terror. Welid himself, though he
had appeared fond of his child while alive, shed not
a tear on his death, bore his loss with his inherent
apathy, and only as usual exclaimed, "God is
great!" I felt so angry with him for his insensibility,
that I longed to see him go to the shades
after his boy.</p>

<p>There was nothing to hinder me from realising
that wish myself. The sailors only wondered that so
infirm an old man as Welid,&mdash;after having sat open-mouthed,
as it were, to inhale the contagion which
had felled a robust youth,&mdash;should still continue
to breathe: and my putting an end to a thing so out
of all rule as my partner's escaping what seemed
his inevitable fate, might only be deemed a just

<!-- vol 2 page 375 -->

return for his having exposed my life&mdash;with a
dozen others probably more deserving&mdash;in a rotten
vessel. Indeed, it was a proceeding which, in my
situation, few of my former acquaintances would
have considered as more than a fair retaliation,
or would have hesitated to accomplish forthwith;
even though it must have entailed upon them all
the encumbrance of remaining sole possessors of
the joint cargo. Yet, unaccountable as it may
seem, and scarcely justifiable in the eyes of many,
I did nothing to get rid of old Welid; but suffered
him to live on unmolested. It is true that scarcely
had his son breathed his last, than there arose
a storm, of which the very first blast shivered
our bark to splinters. It sent twelve fine young
sailors and their captain to the bottom, but kindly
spared Welid and me; and, as the cargo was now
lost at all events, I determined to atone for whatever
evil thoughts might, without my leave, have
risen in my breast, by doing my utmost to save my
partner. I lugged him after me on a floating hen-coop;
and, as it had not required an out of the
way rough sea to make an end of our crazy skiff,
this vehicle supported its load, until the wind
and current carried us ashore on the neighbouring
coast of Samos.</p>

<p>Welid, who had at most only suffered himself to
be saved, like one of his bales of cotton or bags of
corn, without making a positive resistance, experienced

<!-- vol 2 page 376 -->

on this rather trying occasion so little
extraordinary wear and tear of body or mind, that,
weak and old as he was, he still brought ashore
strength enough to cry out with great satisfaction
on the loss of his cargo, as he had done on that of
his child: "God is great!" While I, on whom
had fallen all the weight of exertion, could scarce
articulate from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Our shipwreck close to the land in broad daylight
had collected round us a number of fishermen,
all impressed with becoming gratitude towards
Providence, not so much for having spared our
lives as for having destroyed our vessel on their
shore. Too late however to push our persons back
into the waves from which we had just emerged,
they exerted themselves the other way; and helped
us on, lest we should witness their proceedings in
regard to the wreck. The little money we had in
our pockets was employed in getting ourselves conveyed,
as soon as the storm subsided, to Koosha-dasi
on the mainland of Anadoly; but this short
voyage completely exhausted our finances, and on
our arrival we had not a para left.</p>

<p>Nor were we, for the present, in want of a para.
The Turk, where bigotry interferes not with his
better feelings, is as charitable as he is confiding.
He neither attributes good fortune entirely to man's
own sagacity, nor ill-luck solely to his imprudence;
and neither is apt to listen with suspicion to the tale

<!-- vol 2 page 377 -->

of the indigent, nor to cast blame on the conduct
of the unfortunate. Looking upon adversity as
proceeding from the same high source from whence
flows prosperity&mdash;feeling as little degraded by the
pressure of God's hand upon him, as elated by its
support&mdash;he confers charity without pride, as he
asks it without meanness. We therefore, who came
as supplicants in need of every thing, found every
thing we needed. Every inhabitant vied with the
rest in supplying our necessities and providing for
our comforts. Hence Welid, who wanted repose,
resolved to avail himself for a few days of the
hospitality so handsomely tendered; while I only
requested a horse and a guide, to take me on to
Smyrna. The two animals were soon found, and I
set off.</p>

<p>Our halting-place, the first night, was a mean-looking
hamlet, situated in a narrow defile. The
next day, after leaning a little more to the right than
appeared our due course, we arrived early in the
afternoon at a place of some note in the plain. As
we were to stop till the next morning, I established
myself in a coffee-house, while Dimitracki the guide
went to look after my horse. Scarce had I lighted
my pipe and begun to sip my coffee, when a tchawoosh,
followed by two or three peasants, walked
in, and summoned me before the Soo-bashee.<sup id="r263"><a href="#n263">263</a></sup></p>

<p>Where bullying seems to be the thing intended,
the best way is to bully the first. Many a man continues

<!-- vol 2 page 378 -->

troublesome only because he has begun to be
so, and knows not how to leave off. "I have no
business with your Soo-bashee," said I therefore to
the messenger&mdash;"If he wants me, here I sit"&mdash;and
immediately I squared myself a little more than
I had done before. Accordingly the tchawoosh
went away, and the Soo-bashee came, followed by
a posse of blackguards of all colours and sizes. My
own guide Dimitracki, the greatest of all, brought
up the rear, and stood peeping between the elbows
of those before him.</p>

<p>I gave the magistrate a nod between civil and
familiar. He gave me nothing in return, but,
gravely squatting himself down at the other end of
the ragged sofa, bade my guide draw near. Dimitracki
advanced, hanging his head, and afraid to
meet my eyes. "So this man," cried the Soo-bashee,
addressing him, but eying me, "you say is
a Russian spy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more certain," answered my
guide, clearing his windpipe, and trying to look
resolute. "Let him but speak, and you will soon
know the Greek by his accent. He is the very
man who betrayed Ockzakow to the Russians.
There was Stavros, and Mavros, and Kokinos, and
Proto, and Psaro, and Georgio, and Marcacki, and
Michaelacki, and Manolacki, and I don't know how
many more of us, who witnessed the whole proceeding.
I know him as I do my father."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 379 -->

<p>A wag here observing that the example chosen
disproved the assertion, Dimitracki grew angry,
corroborated his statement by the most violent oaths,
and called upon another Greek of the name of Petracki
to vouch for his veracity.</p>

<p>Petracki of course confirmed all that Dimitracki
had asserted: he even went further. "Indeed,
your worship," cried he, "there is no end to this
man's iniquities. For, besides betraying both Ockzakow
and Bender, it is he&mdash;and I have it from the
best authority&mdash;who assisted the enemy in intercepting,
near Hissar, your worship's own boat-load
of corn."</p>

<p>The affair of Ockzakow and Bender the Soo-bashee
might perhaps have overlooked, as not within
his province; but the corn was too much. Almost
choked with passion: "Ah! wretch," cried he;
"I could stab you with my own hands. But I
respect the law: I shall therefore only send you,
bound hands and feet, to Tireh; where the Mootsellim,
who is my friend, will be sure to see you
hanged."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried a parcel of fanatical Osmanlees,
"we have stones enough for him here!"</p>

<p>I pledged myself to prove my innocence at
Smyrna; but I scarce was listened to. "Any
traitor," observed the party, "was sure of protection
in that nest of infidelity, among the Frank
consuls;" and the Soo-bashee himself began to be

<!-- vol 2 page 380 -->

abused for not seeing me disposed of on the spot.
Either frightened or pretending to be so, he called
heaven to witness that he had no share in what
might happen; and then bade me be handed over
to the mob, whom he told to act as they thought
proper.</p>

<p>So they seemed fully resolved to do; for all were
drawing their cutlasses. A flourish was all I had left
for it. Spiridion's pocket-book still kept its place
in my bosom. Solemnly pulling it out: "By the
dread seal of our sovereign, inclosed in this case,"
exclaimed I emphatically, "I command you, slaves,
to disperse. Tremble to impede my progress! For
each hair of my head a life shall answer."</p>

<p>At this lofty speech, uttered in an appropriate
tone, the audience looked aghast, the rioters slunk
away, and the Aga begged to provide me with a
suitable escort. "I want none," I replied; "an
invisible guardian watches over my safety. The
wretch who brought me here shall alone go onward
with me."</p>

<p>That was exactly what Dimitracki felt least inclined
to do. His little scheme had been to purloin
my steed, and, in order to obviate any opposition on
my part, he had hit upon the expedient of swearing
away my life. He now became so frightened that
he fell upon his knees, and confessed all his untruths.
"He had told them out of sheer loyalty,
and, in reality, I ought to feel much obliged to him;

<!-- vol 2 page 381 -->

but all he asked for was to go with me no farther."
I protested I could not give up his company, and
had him closely watched, while I condescendingly
accepted a lodging for the night under the Aga's
roof.</p>

<p>At sunrise I again set off, ordering Dimitracki
to take the lead. I destined him a remembrance
that should benefit other travellers: but I soon
found it was easier to lodge a musket-ball in his
side than to bestow a milder correction on his back.
The fellow looked as strong as Hercules, and,
though pacing on before me in gloomy silence, with
his head stuck in his stomach and his eyes cast on
the ground, he seemed so constantly on the alert,
that it was quite impossible to take him by surprise.
Even when we halted to take a little rest,
he no longer lay down as formerly behind the
bushes, but squatted himself with his back against
a tree and his face turned to me, so that I could
not stir a step unperceived; and, though he pretended
to sleep, it was only with one eye. Every
time I approached him, he jumped upon his legs,
to ask me what I wanted.</p>

<p>At last we came to a pass in the mountains which
looked propitious to my scheme. Here, having
succeeded through dint of management to knock
the fellow down and to confine his hands and feet,
I gave him the destined drubbing with unsparing
liberality; which done, I fastened him to a tree,

<!-- vol 2 page 382 -->

there to ruminate at his leisure upon the wholesome
lesson. Ismir's gulf was in sight, and I could spare
a guide.</p>

<p>My first care on arriving was to recover the insurance
on the shipwrecked cargo. After some delay,
occasioned by legal inquiries, affidavits, &amp;c. I
got indemnified for every bale of cotton put on
board. Welid, who in the mean time had also reappeared,
declined to share in the recovery as he
had refused to join in the insurance. It was only by
stratagem I could make him accept a small part of
the produce. No way cured however by his loss, of
his blind confidence in his destiny, he continued to
commit fresh imprudences, until from the condition
of a wealthy merchant he became reduced to that of
a poor basket-maker; but whenever we met, he still
would lay aside his osier twigs to point to heaven,
and to cry out, "God is great!"</p>

<p>While following up the recovery of my insurance,
I fell in with a curious personage,&mdash;a Turk who had
sought the protection of the French consulate at
Smyrna. Descended from a Sultana, Isaac-Bey had
in his boyhood been selected as playmate to the present
Sultan. Soon, however, his fickle disposition
made him quit the seclusion of the seraglio for the
command of a galley. His jovial humour and his
freedom from Turkish prejudices caused him to be
much courted in the different sea-ports by the Frank
merchants; and their conversation inspired him with

<!-- vol 2 page 383 -->

a wish to behold Christendom. All at once Isaac-Bey
disappeared from his station, and the next news
of the truant came from Naples. Some said his
escape had the sanction of his master, desirous
through his old confidant to explore the arts of
Europe, and to learn what infidel improvements
might be transplanted with success to the Turkish
dominions; nor was Isaac-Bey at any pains to contradict
the report. Statesmen, therefore, courted
in him the favourite of his future sovereign, as the
fair did the favourite of nature. The genteel Turk
became the fashion in Christendom, and every body
wanted to see a Frenchified Moslemin, who eat an
<i>omelette au lard</i>, drank champaign, and wore a
miniature of his Circassian mistress.</p>

<p>It was entertaining enough to hear Isaac give an
account of his journey. "Unaccustomed," said he,
"as I was, to the shocking sight of men and women
mixing in public, or posture-making exhibited otherwise
than for hire, how did I stare when, on my arrival
in Christendom, I was taken to a ball at the
house of a Bey. I thought little of the dancing:&mdash;none
of the females knew how to shake their hips;
but their faces I liked, spite of their plastered heads.
I went up to the one that led off, and watching
my opportunity, slipped a purse into her hand. I
thought she would have boxed my ears, and every
body turned up their eyes in astonishment,&mdash;the
lady being the principal wife to the first Visier. In

<!-- vol 2 page 384 -->

my own mind the impropriety rested with herself:
but the adventure made me cautious how I spoke.
Before the unsuccessful overture, I had secretly
destined three or four of the damsels present an
apartment in my harem on the channel; unfortunately
one was the daughter of the Re&iuml;s-effendee,
the other the wife of the Cazi-Asker,<sup id="r264"><a href="#n264">264</a></sup> and the third
the Spanish ambassadress: so that all I durst offer
them was a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>"At Rome I went to see the grand Mufti of the
Christians, who bears the same title with our Greek
papases. He appeared a very modest, well behaved,
quiet gentleman. His suite made more fuss about
him than he did about himself. They dressed and
undressed him a dozen times in the middle of the
church, changed his caps, fed him, kneeled to him,
and sang to him. As I stood a good way from the
table, which was richly decked out with gold cups
and candlesticks, I took the leading performers in
this show, with their sleek faces, their laced petticoats,
and their long trains, for the pontiff's wives;&mdash;they
were only his Cardinals. In fact, he is not
allowed to marry, though&mdash;like our Sultan&mdash;he has
his troop of medjboobs.<sup id="r265"><a href="#n265">265</a></sup> These however he keeps,
not to guard his harem, but to sing in his chapel;
and so dismally do they squall with their shrill pipes,
that it is called a <i>miserere</i>. Finding Rome a very
ruinous place, I was glad to leave it.</p>

<p>"From Italy," continued the Bey, "where I

<!-- vol 2 page 385 -->

saw nothing but priests and <i>cavalier-serventes</i>, I
went to France, where I was pestered by <i>petit-ma&icirc;tres</i>
and philosophers: but they so often exchanged
characters, that I never could tell which
was which. Strangely was my poor Turkish brain
puzzled on discovering the favourite pastime of a
nation, reckoned the merriest in the world. It consisted
in a thing called tragedies, whose only purpose
is to make you cry your eyes out. Should
the performance raise a single smile, the author is
undone. Much however as I was bidden to weep,
I could not help roaring out with laughter, when I
saw an old princess in a hoop three yards wide die
for love of a young prince with his cheeks painted
all over: but my bad taste excited great contempt.
One day they took me to a representation of Turks;&mdash;as
if I had not seen real ones enough. Luckily
I did not find them out; as I must otherwise have
knocked down a fellow in a feathered nightcap, for
daring to travestie our holy Prophet. The place
called the Opera, with its fine show of dancing-girls,
pleased me the most of any. The first time
indeed of my going there, on seeing a superb
palace crumble to pieces, I thought there was an
earthquake, and ran out as fast as possible, expecting
the whole house to come down about my
ears: but by degrees I got used to those accidents,
and, though I could never think all the jaw before
the scenes otherwise than very tiresome, I often

<!-- vol 2 page 386 -->

thought the show behind them exceedingly pleasant.</p>

<p>"The French are all prodigious talkers; but
those who never ceased were a sect called economists.
They were for making the country produce nothing
but what might be put into the stomach: forgetting
that men have eyes as well as palates, and that if the
former find nothing to feed upon, the latter will consume
double quantities&mdash;were it only to kill time;
and thus turn economy into waste. This I ventured
to observe: but they shrugged up their shoulders,
and said I was a Turk!</p>

<p>"Being so near England, I had a mind to visit
London. My French friends&mdash;I mean of the female
sex&mdash;strongly opposed the idea. 'It would ruin all
my newly acquired French good-breeding. Besides,'
added Madame de Mirian, 'those islanders are so
proud of the ditch which shuts them out from the
world, that life is scarce long enough to thaw the
icy coldness of their first reception. They will indeed
tell you, as they did me, that if your lungs can but
stand their smoke a dozen years, you may be admitted
to the honour of stirring their fire,&mdash;that is
to say,&mdash;of finding yourself at home in their chimney
corner; but, in the mean time, if you dress like
themselves, you will be left to your own meditations,
and if you vary from them only in the width
of your shoe-straps, you will be stifled with impertinent
curiosity: to say nothing of their churlishness

<!-- vol 2 page 387 -->

in not admitting strangers otherwise than by sea&mdash;and
prohibiting all French articles!'</p>

<p>"These last instances of ill breeding persuaded
me: and, as I had a little French article which I did
not like to leave, I stayed at Paris till the accession of
my imperial master made me return home, and console
myself for the pleasures I quitted by the honours
which awaited me.</p>

<p>"The first which I received was an order for my
exile at Lemnos: but this was not the last. My
enemies accused me of having, in my rambles, not
only ridiculed the laws of the Prophet, but committed
the dignity of the Sultan. So great a crime
required an adequate punishment. Sitting mournfully
in the boat in which I fancied myself going to
the place of my banishment, my eye caught the
looking-glass at the prow, and, in that too faithful
mirror, the reflection of my conductor seated behind
me, just as he was showing the boatmen how in half
an hour my head would be bouncing at my feet.
Judge of my situation. A French tragedy was
nothing to it. At Paris I had got quite out of the
habit of such transactions.</p>

<p>"Arrived at the Dardanelles, I was stowed in the
dungeon of the castle, while my guardians loaded
the great gun that was to announce to the world my
happy exit, by the inestimable honour of the Padishah's
own commands. Just at that moment,
Se&iuml;d-Aly, returned from blockading the Russians

<!-- vol 2 page 388 -->

in the Black-Sea, was passing with his squadron full
sail through the straits. He failed not to claim the
ancient privilege of the fleet to liberate a prisoner in
the castle. But what was his delight to find himself
by that means&mdash;spite of every opposition&mdash;the preserver
of his old friend. My sudden translation from
a dark underground dungeon filled with fierce executioners,
to a brilliant state cabin skimming the
waves, in which each face showed a friend, had such
an effect on my senses, that at first I thought the
whole business a dream, and kept feeling myself all
over&mdash;and especially my neck&mdash;before I could believe
it to be a reality.</p>

<p>"Se&iuml;d was giving chase to the pirate Lambro.
Ere he proceeded, he deposited me in this place,
under the safeguard of the French flag. I have
been here some time, but now no longer regret my
disgrace, since it procures me the inestimable felicity
of your acquaintance."</p>

<p>At this extravagant compliment I burst out
laughing,&mdash;told Isaac-Bey I was glad to see how
much he had profited by his travels, and made him
laugh too. We however became friends in earnest;
and while I remained at Smyrna, scarce a day passed
without our drinking together&mdash;hidden behind the
tri-coloured flag newly hoisted&mdash;a glass of muscadel
to the health of the little French article, saved from
the English custom-house.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>HAD my fancy for trade continued in full force,
Smyrna was the place in which to gratify that taste
to the utmost of my faculties. In that trucking,
trafficking city people's ideas run upon nothing but
merchandise: their discourse only varies between
the exchanges and the markets: their heads are full
of figs and raisins, and their whole hearts wrapped
up in cotton and broad cloths: they suppose man
created for nothing but to buy and sell; and whoever
makes not these occupations the sole business
of his life, seems to them to neglect the end of his
existence. I verily believe that they marry for no
other purpose but to keep up the race of merchants
and bankers.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

<p>But that unbounded indulgence in the luxuries
of commerce was rather calculated to give a man of
my variable appetite a surfeit of its sweets. Full
two months had now elapsed since I first launched
into the commercial line,&mdash;a circumstance sufficient
in itself to diminish my enthusiasm for its charms;
and in the course of those two months a single fortunate
speculation had rendered me independent of
its drudgery. I therefore slackened in my ardor,
began to lose the good opinion of the Smyrniotes,
and, reciprocating their abated regard, resolved
again to return to Stambool; there to become, if
possible, a Pasha for my money. The plan indeed
might not be quite consistent with my recent
solemn renunciation of all ambitious schemes, when
yet fresh from seeing their dismal end in Valachia;
but&mdash;when was I consistent; or when was not the
wish to rise, the ruling passion of my soul?</p>

<p>My last mercantile transaction at Smyrna consisted
in buying of Isaac-Bey a pair of pistols, made
for use in England, and rendered ornamental in
Turkey. They were destined for Hadjee Bollad-Ogloo,
chief of the mighty house of Kara-Osman,
lords paramount of a great part of Anadoly. I had
long purposed visiting this venerable old Aga, (for
notwithstanding his real power, his nominal rank
rose no higher) at Magnesia his residence; and
now, in my way to the capital, put the often abandoned
scheme in execution.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

<p>When presented to the chief, in his thriving residence;
"Accept these arms," said I, "as the
homage of a grateful traveller, who has found them
useless amid the security which you have established
in your wide domain."</p>

<p>Hadjee-Bollad received my offering, not with the
contemptuous indifference of a Constantinopolitan
upstart, afraid lest the smallest symptom of admiration
should be construed into an acknowledgment
of inferiority; but with the courteousness of one,
whose ancestors for many generations back had stood
high in the public estimation, as well as himself. He
praised the beauty of the present, and appeared
anxious to make an immediate trial of its excellence.
"Age," said he, "has somewhat impaired my
strength; but between this sort of weapon and my
hand there has subsisted so long an acquaintance,
that they often still seem to understand each other,
almost without my participation."</p>

<p>He then, from his very seat, took aim across the
wooden trellis of the window at a magpie, chattering
on the top of a cypress tree in the court. To
this bird had been given the name of Tchapan-Ogloo.
It was that of another great territorial proprietor
in Anadoly, the rival of the house of Kara-Osman
in wealth, in power, and in extent of domain.
He fired, exclaiming, "Fall, Tchapan-Ogloo!" and
brought down the bird.</p>

<p>"I do not know," continued he, in great glee at

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

this achievement, "whether you think your present
thrown away, but I am quite sure that the one here
suing for your acceptance, cannot be better bestowed."
This was a handsome horse, richly caparisoned,
which Hadjee-Bollad desired me to keep,
"in remembrance," he said, "of the patriarch of
Magnesia."</p>

<p>Impatient to justify his compliment, I vaulted
into the saddle, wrested a spear out of the hands of
an attendant, and at full gallop hurled it deep into
the trunk of the tree on which had sat the magpie.</p>

<p>"Well done!" cried the Aga. "Your race, I perceive,
has resembled my own: with this difference,
that you are just starting in the career, and that I
am near its end. You may tell them so at Stambool:
but lest their joy at hearing it be too extravagant,
tell them too that the old stock leaves a few
offsets&mdash;like yourself!"</p>

<p>I had intended to continue my journey the same
evening: but, without pressing me to stay, the lord
of Magnesia seemed to have contemplated my going
away again so soon, as a thing so totally impossible,
that I felt not resolution sufficient to take leave. I
had not even an opportunity of representing the prolongation
of my visit as a deviation from my original
plan. To the Aga's hospitable disposition it would
have appeared like owning a nefarious design.</p>

<p>Seeing me in admiration of the activity and bustle
which prevailed throughout his residence;&mdash;of the

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

piles of cotton, the strings of camels, the goods
loading and unloading, and the guides coming and
going on every side: "this," said the Aga, "is
only our peace establishment; but we are equally
well equipped for war. At a day's notice we can
bring into the field twenty thousand sturdy horsemen
as well mounted as armed, for the defence of
the empire&mdash;or for our own!"</p>

<p>"And with so much wealth," cried I, "and so
much power, you have been able to avoid thus long
the Sultan's dangerous honours?"</p>

<p>"It has cost us a little," hastily rejoined Hadjee.
"We have paid greater sums to keep our heads out
of the noose, than others do to thrust their necks
into it: but simple Agas we came into the world,
and simple Agas we are determined, God granting,
to go out of it. Independence, and the right of
leaving our vast domain, inherited from a long line
of ancestors, to a long line of descendants, would be
ill exchanged for the empty name of Visier, with
servitude as the certain, and confiscation of the paternal
estate, as the probable result."<sup id="r266"><a href="#n266">266</a></sup></p>

<p>At this moment a steward advanced to inform
Hadjee, that a troop of Albanians, fled from the
oppression of some Roumiliote Pasha, were just
come to crave his protection, and to beg some employment&mdash;or
some waste land.</p>

<p>"Tell them," replied the Aga, "they shall have
both." Then turning to me: "in granting such

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

requests," he added, "the giver is the gainer." I
praised him for his liberality.</p>

<p>"Praise me for my sense," answered he, "in
having discovered that my income bears more fruit
in my tenants' hands than in my own coffers. You
complimented me on the security of my roads. It
was obtained, not by watching my subjects, but by
giving them work. When people toil in mind and
in body to improve their own property, they have
not leisure to covet that of others."</p>

<p>For three days my ears feasted on Hadjee's
wisdom, and my palate on his good fare: the dawn
of the fourth ushered in the preparations for my
departure. "I suppose," said my kind host, "that
you only quit my residence for that of the younger
branches of my family, at Bergamo<sup id="r267"><a href="#n267">267</a></sup> and at Yaya-keui."
Without pledging myself to perform this
more extensive circuit, I begged permission on my
return from Stambool again to visit the chief himself.
"Then do not tarry long," answered Hadjee:
"I myself have a journey to perform, in which, old
as I am, I may safely engage to outrun you, spite
of all your activity." On this we took leave. I
mounted my new horse, and departed.</p>

<p>But, though my person sped onward, my mind,
as if wholly detached from its case of flesh and
blood, continued stationary with Hadjee. It seemed
riveted to the happy spot where the old Aga
exercised his mild dominion; and all the way

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

to Constantinople, my thoughts still dwelt at Magnesia.
There was in its to me novel scene&mdash;in
that tranquil enjoyment of life's present sweets,
first truly witnessed under Hadjee's friendly roof&mdash;an
inexpressible charm. It left insipid, it almost
converted into positive pain in the comparison, the
pitiful half-tasted pleasures, snatched from fleeting
time by the wretched victim to ambitious schemes:&mdash;schemes
of which the labour is certain, the accomplishment
doubtful, and the very success productive
only of fruits too often insipid or bitter.</p>

<p>It was true, indeed, that many possessed not the
means thus to saunter at leisure, like Hadjee-Aga,
along paths strewed with roses. The greater number
of mortals must first clear their way through tracts
bristling with thorns and briars:&mdash;they must toil to
support life, ere they could afford leisure for its enjoyment.
I myself had experienced that condition:
I myself had been obliged to labour hard for a competency;
nay, had found all my hard labour of no
avail to obtain it; and only an event wholly unlooked-for
amid all my schemes, had at last given
me that independence, so long pursued in vain.</p>

<p>But I finally possessed it: and I might now purchase
every luxury of life, calculated to content the
man exempt from ambition's maddening thirst:&mdash;I
might now command every species of tangible gratification,
save only that which consists in the power

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

of diffusing very extensive misery. Pleasant dwellings,
a plenteous board, a handsome retinue of servants,
a well assorted harem, and whatever else was
of a nature directly to delight the sense, were things
now within my easy reach; and the only circumstance
still wanting to set them off to the greatest
advantage, was the power of inflicting a certain
quantity of starvation and torture, wherever the too
bright sunshine of the picture might require the relief
of deeper shadows;&mdash;the right to maintain a
certain number of humbler instruments and witnesses
of my pleasures, who should tremble at my
frown, and turn pale when I spoke.</p>

<p>But, for the sake only of a few such additional
relishes, was it worth my while again to risk the
fortune already acquired, and to sacrifice the comforts
already brought within my compass, when a
thousand were at present the additional chances
against my success in new schemes of aggrandisement;
and a thousand more the hazards against
the possession of the object sought, answering my
expectations?</p>

<p>How often had I, in my various wanderings, from
the mountain's highest apex espied some distant
valley, which, thus indistinctly perceived, seemed to
promise as soon as entered an end to all fatigue,
and to my wearisome journey a concluding stage
over a velvet turf;&mdash;but which, on a nearer approach,

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

proved a sink of swamps and quagmires, a
thousand times more irksome and vexatious than the
steep and rugged path encountered at my outset!</p>

<p>Even thus it fared with every object of human
pursuit. When considered from that distance which
only left its leading features discernible, each alike
promised a series only of unalloyed enjoyments;
and each&mdash;when its lesser details rose in sight, only
showed itself the harbour of a thousand petty
troubles, nameless inconveniences, and hourly cares
and restraints, waiting to devour inch by inch the
felicity of that possession which, viewed in the gross,
seemed so attractive.</p>

<p>"Away then," cried I, "for ever away all further
chase after these visions, as lying as they are
gaudy,&mdash;after these fire-flies of the mind, which only
flit over swamps, and, when caught, leave a sting!
Who would wish for their unsubstantial glare,
while rich fruits, ripe for gathering, grow by his
way side?"&mdash;and hereupon, lest I should dearly
purchase disappointment, I determined for ever to
renounce distant schemes, of whatever sort or description
they might be:&mdash;for, fool as I still was,
I forgot that there may be great pleasure in the
pursuit even of an object found worthless when
attained; and that he manages his means of happiness
but poorly, who, while his existence affords
room both for realities and dreams,&mdash;while in

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

fact dreams are wanted to fill up the unavoidable
chasms intervening between the few pleasing realities,&mdash;renounces
all those airy but delightful
phantoms of the imagination&mdash;last to exhaust or to
cloy.</p>

<p>Indeed I made a mistake more woful still than
that of only renouncing whatever depended for its
final attainment on future contingencies. Contemplating
Hadjee-Aga, my new model, only in a small
part of his conduct, and not considering that the
charm which surrounded his tranquillity, derived,
like that of the immoveable sun, from the extensive
diffusion of its beneficial influence, I contracted my
plan of present enjoyment until it became wholly
selfish and sensual. Wholly intent upon those
pleasures which flourish only in youth, and health,
and freedom, I overlooked the other better portion
of those allotted to man, which do not fade even in
age, in infirmity, and in durance.</p>

<p>The merit of the new design I had conceived;
the wisdom of thus founding the whole fabric of my
earthly happiness on gratifications wholly tangible,
still continued the ruling theme of my self-applauding
thoughts, when I began to discover Scutari, the
principal outpost of the capital on the Asiatic shore;
and in the neighbourhood of that city&mdash;harshly
edging the horizon&mdash;the black streak of cypresses
that mark its immense cemeteries,<sup id="r268"><a href="#n268">268</a></sup> the last resting-place

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

of those who, dying in Constantinople, fear
that their bones may some day be disturbed, if laid
in the unhallowed ground of Europe.</p>

<p>A dense and motionless cloud of stagnant vapours
ever shrouds these dreary realms. From
afar a chilling sensation informs the traveller that
he approaches their dark and dismal precincts; and
as he enters them an icy blast, rising from their inmost
bosom, rushes forth to meet his breath, suddenly
strikes his chest, and seems to oppose his
progress. His very horse snuffs up the deadly
effluvia with signs of manifest terror, and, exhaling
a cold and clammy sweat, advances reluctantly over
a hollow ground, which shakes as he treads it, and
loudly re-echoes his slow and fearful step. So long
and so busily has time been at work to fill this
chosen spot,&mdash;so repeatedly has Constantinople
poured into this ultimate receptacle almost its whole
contents, that the capital of the living, spite of its
immense population, scarce counts a single breathing
inhabitant for every ten silent inmates of this city
of the dead. Already do its fields of blooming
sepulchres stretch far away on every side, across
the brow of the hills and the bend of the valleys:
already are the avenues which cross each other at
every step in this domain of death so lengthened,
that the weary stranger, from whatever point he
comes, still finds before him many a dreary mile
of road between marshalled tombs and mournful

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

cypresses, ere he reaches his journey's seemingly
receding end; and yet, every year does this common
patrimony of all the heirs to decay still exhibit
a rapidly increasing size, a fresh and wider line of
boundary, and a new belt of young plantations,
growing up between new flower-beds of graves.<sup id="r269"><a href="#n269">269</a></sup></p>

<p>As I hurried on through this awful repository,
the pale far-stretching monumental ranges rose in
sight, and again receded rapidly from my view in
such unceasing succession, that at last I fancied
some spell possessed my soul, some fascination kept
locked my senses; and I therefore still increased
my speed, as if only on quitting these melancholy
abodes I could hope to shake off my waking delusion.
Nor was it until, near the verge of the
funereal forest through which I had been pacing
for a full hour, a brighter light again gleamed
athwart the ghost-like trees, that I stopped to look
round, and to take a more leisurely survey of the
ground which I had traversed.</p>

<p>"There," said I to myself, "lie, scarce one foot
beneath the surface of a swelling soil, ready to burst
at every point with its festering contents, more than
half the generations whom death has continued
to mow down for near four centuries in the vast
capital of Islamism. There lie, side by side, on the
same level, in cells the size of their bodies, and only
distinguished by a marble turban somewhat longer
or deeper&mdash;somewhat rounder or squarer,&mdash;personages

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

in life far as heaven and earth asunder, in
birth, in station, in gifts of nature, and in long
laboured acquirements. There lie, sunk alike in
their last sleep,&mdash;alike food for the worm that lives
on death&mdash;the conqueror who filled the universe
with his name, and the peasant scarce known in his
own hamlet; Sultan Mahmoud, and Sultan Mahmoud's
perhaps more deserving horse;<sup id="r270"><a href="#n270">270</a></sup> elders
bending under the weight of years, and infants of a
single hour; men with intellects of angels, and men
with understandings inferior to those of brutes;
the beauty of Georgia, and the black of Sennaar;
Visiers, beggars, heroes and women. There perhaps
mingle their insensible dust the corrupt judge
and the innocent he condemned, the murdered man
and his murderer, the adulteress and her injured
husband, the master and his meanest slave. There
vile insects consume the hand of the artist, the brain
of the philosopher, the eye which sparkled with
celestial fire, and the lip from which flowed irresistible
eloquence. All the soil pressed by me for
the last two hours was once animated like myself;
all the mould which now clings to my feet, once
formed limbs and features similar to my own. Like
myself, all this black unseemly dust once thought,
and willed, and moved!&mdash;And I, creature of clay
like those here cast around; I, who travel through
life as I do on this road, with the remains of past
generations strewed along my trembling path; I

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

who, whether my journey last a few hours more or
less, must still, like those here deposited, shortly
rejoin the silent tenants of some cluster of tombs,
be stretched out by the side of some already sleeping
corpse, and while time continues its course,
have all my hopes and fears&mdash;all my faculties and
prospects&mdash;laid at rest on a couch of clammy earth:
shall I leave the rose to blush along my path unheeded,
the purple grape to wither unculled over
my head? and in the idle pursuit of some dream of
distant grandeur that may delude me while I live,
spurn, till death mock my speed, all the present delights
which invite my embrace?&mdash;Far from my
thoughts be such folly! Whatever tempts let me
take: whatever bears the name of enjoyment, henceforth,
let me, while I can, make my own!"</p>

<p>It was thus that scenes, which at other times and
with a mind differently predisposed, might have
frightened away every scheme of enjoyment in
which the sense had a share, now only made me
hug my wholly sensual plan with greater paternal
fondness.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Constantinople I proceeded immediately
to execute my sage intentions. So constantly
did I keep the fear of death before my eyes,
that I never procrastinated the smallest of the
pleasures of life; nor suffered the least unseasonable
reflection to break in upon my wiser employment
of my hours. I wanted no attendant to remind

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

me daily that I was mortal; but, wholly unadmonished,
lived each day as if it was to be my last.</p>

<p>While skudding full sail down the stream of
pleasure, a sudden side puff of the most extravagant
ambition which had ever yet arisen in my foolish head,
blew across the current whose impulse I passively
obeyed, and drove me for a time wholly from my
course. It was occasioned by a report, true or false,
spread at Pera, of the state of complete anarchy
into which had fallen the autocratical boudoir of all
the Russias, by the dismissal, or discomfiture, or
death of some reigning favourite. Two or three
youngsters, it was added, gifted only with overweening
presumption, had attempted to succeed the
fallen hero, but had died of mere fright previous to
their installation. In this situation of affairs it
struck me that I might have a chance, and only
needed to be seen, in order to charm, and win the
prize.</p>

<p>The adventure seemed worth while trying every
way. In the first place, a Greek of talent was
always sure of promotion in the Russian service.
It is true I had been in that of the Turks: but
<i>that</i> circumstance only rendered my posture the
more promising. Friends after all were friends;
whilst enemies must be won over. It is true, moreover,
that there was a great disparity between the
lady's age and that of her self-destined admirer:
but I knew that, if I could get over the objection,

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

she would; and in order not to let it arrest me,
determined only to see in every furrow of her face
the fold of a well-filled purse, and in every spot or
freckle on her fair skin the insignia of some brilliant
order. Once, therefore, a smart tight laced colonel
in the Br&eacute;obra&iuml;ski body guard, who doubted the
rest? Who would want resolution, if required to
remove an emperor, or to console an empress? Not
Anastasius for certain! "Chill of age nor of
climate," cried I, "shall stop me; I shall grasp at
all, become another Potemkin, rule an empire, have
a court, alternate between arranging f&ecirc;tes and planning
campaigns; pay my card-money in diamonds,
make mosaic-work of provinces, plant orange and
citron groves on hanging terraces of icicles, and,
when tired of illuminations on the Neva, set on fire
the Bosphorus&mdash;and transport the seat of empire
from the vicinity of the White Sea, to the shores of
the Black Sea!"</p>

<p>I had already put myself into regular training;
and for the purpose of accustoming my eye to the
familiar contemplation of the great Ekatharina's
charms, had actually, Mohammedan as I was,
bought a plaster bust of her majesty, in more respects
than one, as I was told, greatly resembling
the original; when a little Greek baggage of Pera
stepped in between, and audaciously seized upon
the destined minister of the mighty autocratrix of
all the Russias.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

<p>The place where I sat by preference, while combining
my plan, was my bay window; and this bay
window happened to face a gazebo, where sat in
the same way, when musing on her projects, a fair
Greek widow, who, it seems, was not reserving herself
for any northern potentate whatsoever. Somehow
the fascinating Katello contrived&mdash;without the
least intention&mdash;to show me through the trellis-work
of her Shah-nishin,<sup id="r271"><a href="#n271">271</a></sup> almost every item of her
various attractions (and she possessed a good many)
in regular succession.</p>

<p>First was beheld&mdash;by mere chance&mdash;a bright
eye, very dark, full of fire, and not at all the worse
for wear, notwithstanding all the service it had seen.
It incautiously showed itself while in the innocent
act of watching the state of the weather, and the
aspect of the clouds. Next peeped out&mdash;lest I
should think there was but one&mdash;its companion;
very much resembling the other in most particulars,
and which went forth into the street very much
upon the same guileless errand. In adjusting these
said eyes to the small openings left for them by the
laths, came in view somewhat lower than themselves,
the tip of a little nose very prettily turned.
Presently some acquaintance of the lady's, situated
on my side of the street&mdash;but whom I never could
descry&mdash;gave cause for certain signs in dumb show,
chiefly performed by a pair of pouting lips of the
true vermilion hue; and these signs were accompanied

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

by certain looks, whose lightning glanced so
close by me as actually almost to singe off the end
of my left mustachio, which indeed was fined off to
an immeasurable point. Nor did the reluctant display
of distant attractions end here. Ever and
anon the settling of the perverse blinds required
the ministry of a certain number of rosy fingers,
most gracefully tapered; but these ill trained attendants
set about their task with such provoking
awkwardness, that for the most part two round
white arms were obliged in their turn to venture out
as auxiliaries, for the purpose of reinstating what
the hands had undone. In fine, one day, more
than usual efforts to put to rights an entangled
window-curtain caused such dreadful confusion,
that, through the double care of adjusting the
drapery overhead without deranging that underneath,
neither object was attained, and at last the
upholstery of the room came down upon that of its
fair tenant. Civility now no longer permitted me
to remain an inactive spectator of my neighbour's
embarrassments. I ran down to my door, and
up to the opposite window, and tried to extricate
the adorable widow from her manifold difficulties.
Until that instant I had only obtained sight of her
person in detached samples; and what I now saw in
the piece did not belie the expectations raised. It
seemed to defy criticism throughout. I, who could
worship the cloven foot itself, <i>bien chauss&eacute;</i>, was

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

fascinated with the one I beheld, and, like another
Mark Anthony, gave up for love the empire of the
world!</p>

<p>In order that the union might begin with speed,
and yet be of a nature to terminate with decency,
we agreed upon one of those short-hand marriages
called by the Turks cabeen:&mdash;but, for the purpose
of avoiding the obloquy to which nuptials of that
sort are liable, notwithstanding their legality, ours
were to be kept a secret; and, assuredly, if safety
lies in numbers, no secret could be safer, for all the
world was told of it:&mdash;yet did the wary widow furthermore
insist, in order the better to cloak my
good reception in private, upon my abusing her
roundly in public;&mdash;a clause, from which the natural
gallantry of my disposition recoiled at first as
from an atrocious crime.</p>

<p>But by degrees I gave into the scheme more
readily. In fact&mdash;from what change in my optics
I know not&mdash;I began after a time to think that
some fault might be found here and there, without
doing great violence to truth. Some of the deceitful
Katello's beauties seemed, in my eyes at least,
much diminished, and others wholly vanished; I
might almost say, wiped away. Her eyebrows had
lost their evenness, and her lips their colour: her
very eyes, I could have sworn, had shrunk in their
sockets; and though her mouth was become proportionably
larger, this scarce made amends for the

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

other abridgments. What I had before viewed as
a beauty spot, I now saw as a huge mole; and a
certain easy languor in her gait had grown into a
positive lameness. The lady pretended to be little
better pleased with the bargain herself;&mdash;nay, when
I boasted of my zeal in following her instructions,
and, in particular, of the unfavourable description
I had given of her ankles, so far from retracting her
complaints and resuming her good humour, she
fell into a most outrageous passion, and cried, "It
was her conduct, not her person, she had bidden
me abuse!"</p>

<p>I promised to do so yet, paid the forfeit money,
and resumed my liberty. Enough had now been
achieved in my opinion, in the way of marriage, for
the acquittal even of my Mohammedan conscience;
to the peace of which I deemed four wives by no
means necessary, either simultaneously or even successively,
whatever may be thought on the subject
in Christendom,&mdash;nay, whatever might be asserted
even by the more strict and rigorous among my
Islamite friends themselves, who ceased not to din
in my ears that celibacy was a continual transgression
of the law, and that every man as well as
woman of a religious turn of mind made it a point
of duty to live constantly married, in some way or
other. Neither the charms of a young Halebeen<sup id="r272"><a href="#n272">272</a></sup>
of sixteen, described to me by my female scouts as
already weighing eighty okkas, nor even those of a

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

young lady from Adrianople, a year or two older
indeed, but weighing full half a kantar, could therefore
conquer my obstinate resolution.</p>

<p>But I soon found that so entire an abandonment
of the duties of matrimony was indulging overmuch
in the delights of ease and quiet&mdash;was overshooting
the purposed mark; that, hard as may be the toil of
too severe a task, equally heavy was the burthen
of complete idleness&mdash;equally irksome the lot of
lacking all employment&mdash;equally oppressive the labour
of having constantly to seek some new amusement;
or, rather, of being constantly obliged to
supply by some imaginary wants the absence of
real substantial necessities. None of my contrivances
for this purpose struck at the root of the
evil; and often, in the midst of the most boundless
mirth and revelry, I caught myself regretting
those times of toil and danger, when I used to have
a meal one day, and to go without the next; to lie
down under a hedge one night, and on that ensuing
to remain like a stork upon my legs; and, always
on the alert, alternately to smoke a pipe and to
despatch an enemy.</p>

<p>In the midst of this irksome ease, a letter came
from Smyrna which gave a new impulse to my
thoughts and wishes. It was written by a distant
relation settled at Trieste, who, having employed
his whole life in accumulating a considerable fortune,
was now beginning to consider how to prevent

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

its waste after his death. Grown old and infirm,
he wished for some younger branch of the
family stock, willing to bear him company during
the remainder of his days, on condition of becoming
his heir on his decease. Cassis Pharaoon, formerly
collector of the customs at Cairo, but lately fled
with all his treasure to the Emperor's dominions,
had mentioned me as likely to acquit myself well in
both offices; and my cousin, called to Smyrna on
business, felt anxious to see me and to sound my
disposition. His invitation held out such flattering
hopes that I could not resist it, but again set out
for the place of figs and raisins, determined to
outdo them in sweetness in my intercourse with my
well-intentioned relation.</p>

<p>Before I could reach Broossa the night had come
on. Its obscurity just allowed me to perceive,
creeping among the tombs, a something which bore
a suspicious look, and at first left me doubtful
whether I should honour it with my notice or continue
my way. Curiosity at last got the better of
discretion. I followed the vision; bidding it, whether
man or devil, to stop and to answer. But as I
advanced it silently retreated, and with so much
speed that I must have lost the scent but for a
gravestone over which the phantom stumbled. It
now, to my great amazement, divided in two. One
part remained motionless where it had fallen, the
other kept running on; and both, as it proved.

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

with equal reason for their different behaviour,&mdash;the
stationary half being nothing but a sackful of dead
men's bones, the moving one the living thief who
was conveying them away. Again I cried to this
personage to stop, if he wished not to be shot; and
he now faced about, but fell upon his knees, and,
in the shape of a caloyer, related his story to move
me to compassion. Sub-deacon to one of the monasteries
on the Agios Oros, he was, he said, with
his archimandrite on an eleemosynary tour. At
the last place of halting the worthy pair had found
their stock of holy ware run so low as to require
replenishing. The nearest burying-ground offered
the readiest means; and the contents of the bag
were nothing more than a few straggling thigh
bones of Turks, picked up in the said repository,
to compose a fresh assortment of Christian relics.</p>

<p>On hearing this account, "wretch," cried I, "or
rather, true jackall, come to despoil our graves!
What should prevent me from making a relic of
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Only the circumstance," humbly replied the
caloyer, "that it would not be worth the while,
at least, in the way of punishment. My halcyon
days are over. The line of route marked out for
us draws to a close; and in less than a fortnight we
must perforce return to our convent, to fast, and
pray, and see nothing in a human form worth looking
on, for the remainder of our miserable lives!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

<p>"Then to kill you would be a mercy," said I,
and let the fellow go,&mdash;glad myself to reach a not
distant khan, where I soon retired to rest. Unfortunately
the caloyer's bag of bones, thus irregularly
canonised, had reminded me of a favourite topic of
Eugenius, namely, the gradual change that takes
place in the component elements of each organic
body, and the successive appropriation that may
thence happen of the same identical particles to different
bodies:&mdash;and the idea of what must be the
consequence of this ordination haunting me as I
went to sleep, I dreamt that I saw a parcel of souls
exceedingly distressed at the sound of the last summons,
one half from finding themselves each pulled
different ways by bodies of different ages, which
they had during their lives successively tenanted;
and the other half, from finding no bodies at all
left for their reception;&mdash;the materials of those
which they had inhabited having since been purloined
by later generations. So great an effect had
the embarrassment of these poor souls upon me, that
I rose in the utmost perturbation, and, stumbling
over some camel-drivers asleep in the passage, I
mistook them for unoccupied carcasses, of which
I was going to dispose in favour of the hapless
destitutes, when a powerful resistance at once roused
and rendered me sensible of my error. My humane
endeavours had this good effect, however,
that in an instant the whole khan was on foot, and

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

I enabled thereby to set off at as early an hour
as my anxiety to reach Smyrna had made me wish
overnight.</p>

<p>Alas! on my arrival in that city, I found I needed
not have made so much diligence. My loving
cousin Delvinioti had returned to Trieste even before
I set off from Stambool, and without so much
as leaving a note or message to account for the
abrupt proceeding. This was rather mortifying,
and made me look very foolish. I stormed, and
raved, and blustered: I considered whether I should
not go after my perfidious relation, and call him out
in single combat; but at last, recollecting that the
disclosure of one slight provokes others, I determined
to look highly pleased; swore I only returned
to Smyrna for the benefit of the climate,
and, to make good my assertion, resolved to stay
the winter, and to spend all my money, in order
that I might seem very happy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> most heirs to humanity thirty seems to be the
age at which those wilder passions, produced more
by the heat of the blood than by the perversion
of the reason, having exhaled their greatest fire,
though they may still warm, no longer torture the
frame: and that age I had now attained;&mdash;and I
might now, according to the usual course of things,
consider myself safe from all danger of being hurried
headlong, by the madness of uncontrollable desires,
into an abyss of misery and regret.</p>

<p>But if the different species of noxious principles,
physical and moral, too liberally mixed up in our
natures, are by most constitutions thrown off at a
single crisis, which, mortal when too severe, renders
life more secure where it has ended favourably,
they find others incapable, either from their weakness
or from the strength of the virus, to expel it
entirely on the first conflict, however great be the
effort and complete appear the victory. In these,
when all the poison is considered as exhaled and
all the danger as past, there will&mdash;at the very moment
when every long agonized heart of friend or
parent hails the deceitful vision of an infallible recovery&mdash;take

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

place a relapse:&mdash;and this relapse
ends in death!</p>

<p>Thus it happened with me. At that very period
when, having for the first time magnanimously
withstood some very powerful temptations, I deemed
myself safe thenceforward from those fiercer tyrants
of the heart which lie chiefly in ambush for their
victim on the threshold of manhood; when I began
foolishly to exult in my firmness:&mdash;as if I had only
by this forbearance been collecting more copious
materials for a more destructive conflagration,&mdash;a
flame arose in my breast, which shook my whole
being&mdash;body and soul&mdash;unto its very basis, and
left the remainder of my worthless life a scene of
ruin, remorse, and desolation!</p>

<p>Yet did the events commence in gaiety, which
ended thus fatally.</p>

<p>In the course of my former mercantile transactions
at Smyrna, I had made in that city a few sober
acquaintances, whom I used occasionally to visit.
The men with whom I habitually lived were a more
jovial set;&mdash;amphibious beings, found in all seaports,
who consider the land only as a place of
passage, regard the sea as their proper element,
and feel equally at home wherever its waves waft
their restless existence: who, like the pebbles on
the beach, lose through dint of constant friction all
their original distinctness of shape in one uniform
similarity of rude, indiscriminate polish, and, with

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

a very complete assortment of the vices of every
different region which they in turns frequent, seem
to belong to no one race, or country, or religion in
particular.</p>

<p>In order peremptorily to exclude from their
society all such individuals as might retain the
smallest tendency to fall into the antiquated errors
of a sober and sedate deportment, these giddy sons
of joy had once upon a day devoted one entire forenoon
to business, and had drawn up a long list of
regulations, which every candidate was held to subscribe
ere he could obtain the high honour of admission.
As to me, so anxious was I to pay the
noble fraternity every compliment in my power,
that I put my name to the conditions blindfold.</p>

<p>On perusing them afterwards, however, I found
but little which every spirited young fellow does
not think himself, even in the absence of a positive
engagement, equally bound in mere honour to
comply with: for who&mdash;to use the language of the
place in which this noble association had sprung up&mdash;would
become a principal in a connubial firm, and
take a female partner at his own risk and peril, that
could, by trading on another man's bottom, add to
his other pleasures the inexpressible delight of making
perhaps his most intimate friend a bankrupt both in
honour and in happiness? what youth of true refinement
could brook in the object of his worship a
conduct so indelicate as that of selling her person, in

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

a mercantile way, for a definite jointure, while she
might mark the difference of her feelings from those
of the mere venal syren, by disregarding every dictate
of interest or of prudence? where is the man
of spirit who would be content with exerting purchased
rights in an open, straight forward, legal
manner, as long as he was enabled to add to his
raptures all the zest of difficulties, and dangers, and
mystery, and mischief? and what hero in gallantry
would prize his mistress's devotion, unless it had
been put to the test by breaking through every
restraint of fear, shame, and pride?&mdash;And these
were the whole of the conditions imposed by the
rules of the society: but so tender-hearted were its
members, that, while feeling the propriety of the
restrictions which confined their choice, they nevertheless
pitied most sincerely the number of poor
females irresistibly smitten with their charms, to
whom they were prevented from extending the
solace of their attentions.</p>

<p>Absolutely stunned by their jactitations, and
obliged to assume the same tone in order to avoid contempt,
I was, for the mere support of my character,
in the act of engaging to find favour in a given
time with whatever beauty might be considered as
the most inaccessible in Smyrna, when, in the very
midst of the circle collected to witness my boastings,
I received the following note:</p>

<p>"You are a man of enterprise; you part with

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

your money freely; you complain, I am told, of
too much facility: but is not the game you pursue
ignoble? You visit the house of Chrysopulo, and
yet you overlook its fairest gem, Euphrosyne!"</p>

<p>I made no doubt that this note had been indited
by some of the party present,&mdash;perhaps by the
whole set, in council assembled. It seemed a sort
of public defiance, a gauntlet thrown by all, which I
must take up, or lose my reputation for gallantry.
I therefore read the epistle aloud, and pledged myself
on the spot to gain the prize selected, or to forfeit
the place which I held in the society. Every
head shook in doubt of my success, or rather every
lip curled up in derision of my presumption. Flushed
with wine I felt my foolish pride alarmed, and
offered to stake large and unequal sums all round
the circle, on what I imagined to be a certain conquest.
They were eagerly accepted: I found myself
engaged ere I scarcely knew to what; and
when I looked round, I had the satisfaction to see
all my friends chuckle inwardly, as if already in
possession of my money.</p>

<p>The subject of the fatal wager was a young lady
related to a wealthy Greek merchant, with whose
wife she lived as a companion. Euphrosyne passed
for a great beauty, and had recently been betrothed,
it was said, to the son of another Greek merchant,
proverbial for his riches. Money, therefore, which
on all other occasions I had found an useful weapon

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

of attack, was in this instance turned against me,
and converted into a powerful means of defence.</p>

<p>I used indeed&mdash;as stated in the insidious note&mdash;sometimes
to call upon the family, of which the
fair Euphrosyne formed so great an ornament. Its
experienced chief had assisted me in some of my
mercantile purchases: but these meetings on mere
business were never allowed to be illumined by the
radiance of Euphrosyne's beauties. The destined
husband himself could scarce ever get sight of his
intended spouse. Whenever even his licensed
footsteps were heard near the threshold, the older
females of the family used to conjure the nymph
away, or at least to form round her person a fence
so impenetrable, as to set at defiance her swain's
hottest fire of sighs and glances. What wonder,
therefore, that a stranger and a Mohammedan,
whose visits were necessarily rare, and whose appearance
put to flight every member of the gynec&aelig;um
unprotected by the &aelig;gis of age or ugliness,
should never have beheld this paragon of perfection,
or known aught of her charms but from common
report?</p>

<p>This circumstance, however, no longer had power
to influence my conduct. Such was the dilemma
into which my thoughtlessness had betrayed me,
that, even were Euphrosyne to offer to my eyes no
charms whatsoever, I still must obtain her, or submit
to ruin,&mdash;ruin of a reputation in truth sufficiently

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

despicable, and ruin of a fortune which I
wanted the courage to despise.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, therefore, I rather wished not
to behold my destined victim&mdash;for so I must call
her&mdash;sooner than was absolutely necessary for the
furtherance of my nefarious purpose; lest a countenance,
resembling, it was said, that of an angel
both in innocence and loveliness, should disarm my
villainy of the coolness requisite to crown its attempts.
All that I wanted in the first instance was
to gain some intelligence among such inferior inhabitants
of the fortress menaced, as, not yet exalted
to the angelic state, might favour from within whatever
operations from without against the citadel
might be deemed most expedient.</p>

<p>On this subject I had begun to meditate very
earnestly, the moment the long protracted revels of
our meeting place permitted me to go home and rest
my weary limbs; and on this same subject, I still
continued meditating with equal intensity, as, after
a late and lazy rising, I trailed my torpid limbs to
the door the next morning, in order to inhale with
fresh air, fresh ideas and fresh spirits.</p>

<p>Alas! Cupid, fond of mischief, saw that which
was hatching in my breast. In the midst of my
uncertainty he sent tripping by my threshold, as if
going on her morning's errands, one of the female
attendants of the very family selected by our society
to writhe under the pangs of unmerited dishonour;

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

and one of no less consequence than Euphrosyne's
own waiting woman; the very person whom, in my
unprincipled eagerness, I could have implored my
accommodating stars to throw in my way. The
waiting woman's face&mdash;I do not know why&mdash;seemed
familiar to me, and equally familiar to her appeared
to be my own features; for, on catching my eye
she curtsied so graciously, as almost to assure me
by her mere manner, of an unlimited devotion to
my most unbounded wishes.</p>

<p>It would have been positively churlish toward
the smiling nymph, as well as neglectful of my own
interest, to let so fair an opportunity slip through
my fingers. After some requisite ceremonial on
my part and a decent demur on hers, I induced
the diligent Sophia to enter my abode; and there
. . . . . . ., but of what consequence is it that I
should detail by what arguments she was won over
to my purpose? Suffice it to state that on disclosing
my situation and wishes, so poorly acted
was the horror with which such proposals are always
at the first outset received, as almost to make me
conceive, from the facility of the domestic, a prejudice
against the fair fame of the mistress herself.
A well filled purse given on the spot as an earnest,
and a considerable sum of money pledged as a final
recompense, sufficed very soon to obtain a promise
of unrestricted co-operation in all my designs. It
was only on being particularly thanked for so ready

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

a compliance with my entreaties, that the waiting
woman, with a becoming modesty, strove to lessen
its merit. "Had Euphrosyne been suspected of
harbouring the smallest spark of affection for her
future consort,"&mdash;the lady observed&mdash;"not all the
treasures in the universe would have obtained from
her so much as a mere patient listening to my
scheme: but the contrary being notorious, she in
fact favoured my suit as much from anxiety for her
mistress's happiness, as from compassion for my
sufferings." I only praised her considerate motives
the more on this welcome information. It rendered
my design at once less heinous in the conception,
and less difficult to execute. To erase old
impressions ere new ones are substituted is an
arduous task, and of doubtful success; but on a
blank sheet of paper, what penman even of the
most ordinary abilities flourishes not away as he
pleases?</p>

<p>Fully as Sophia understood my purpose to be
independent of any very decided feelings of love
harboured in my own breast, she nevertheless could
not help observing how much it might be forwarded
by some such sort of sentiment raised in
Euphrosyne's tender bosom: and, after sagaciously
adding that nothing was so essential to falling in love
with people as seeing them, she proposed to submit
me for the approval of her mistress, in a walk with
a large party of friends, planned for the next day

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

in the fields outside the city. "It is absolutely necessary,"
cried she, "that you should be there as
if by accident. Take no notice of us, but only
give us an opportunity of noticing you. Mine
shall be the care to make a transient glimpse produce
a long remembrance. A turn or two will
suffice for that purpose;&mdash;then, away again, on
your life!&mdash;and curb your impatience till the next
morning disclose to you&mdash;as it will&mdash;what conversation
may have taken place between me and my
young lady at bed-time."</p>

<p>The hint was not lost upon one so eager as Anastasius
to embrace whatever could gratify his vanity.
With more than usual attention therefore to my
toilet, I began the next day. I attired myself, not
richly&mdash;for on some occasions I felt jealous of my
own dress, and fearful lest my finery should eclipse
my person&mdash;but as becomingly as possible. No
insignificant gewgaws were permitted to conceal
the athletic structure of my frame, and the graceful
knitting of my limbs. A mere tuft of jesmine, white
as my own teeth, was made to relieve the brown
polish of my skin, and the jetty black of my beard;
and art and nature were, throughout my whole appearance,
blended in such just proportions, as every
where to adorn and to relieve each other.</p>

<p>Thus attired for conquest, I sallied forth on a
solitary ramble, and sought the verdant meadows
with as much eagerness as does the fiery courser,

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

when, liberated from the gloomy stable, he rejoins
in the field with loud neighings his blithe and
prancing companions.</p>

<p>Not long had I reached the happy valley when
the youthful troop appeared, and by long peals of
laughter proclaimed its too great confidence in a
deceitful security. I first kept myself concealed at
a distance, let the giggling girls duly begin their
sports, and only, when from my ambush I saw
them fairly entrapped in a small and secluded nook
of which I commanded the entrance, did I, like
one attracted by the noise, leisurely step forward
to petrify the gay band by my sudden appearance.
Every gambol immediately ceased; and long before
I could come up with the outermost detachment,
was every scarf and shawl at its office to
conceal its fair owner. The change from the
brightest sunshine to a sky all clouded over is less
rapid even in the month of March. I therefore
walked only once round the party, more to be seen
than to see, and having cast a single keen though
furtive look on its leader, or rather, on the ample
veils which completely dimmed her lustre, I immediately
retired with the air of one who begs pardon
for an unintentional intrusion, which he dares not
exult in, but cannot regret.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that through all Euphrosyne's
jealous fences of silk, and wool, and cotton&mdash;rendered
doubly impenetrable by every addition of

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

fringe, and trimmings, and tassels&mdash;not one single
feature of her face had been revealed to my searching
eye. Even of her figure not much could be
discerned: but what of that? Such is the force of
imagination, that I felt as if I had been permitted
to dwell to my heart's utmost wish on all I came
to see. I went away completely smitten with Euphrosyne's
air, and grace, and playful manner.
What I had not been permitted to behold I moulded
after my own taste; and all the rest of the day, and
all the ensuing night, I kept my fancy busied with
the beautiful image chiefly of my own creation.</p>

<p>Early the next morning walked in my friend
Sophia. Her practice was to waste no precious
time in idle forms. I eagerly inquired what symptoms
my appearance had produced in Chrysopulo's
fair charge. "Draw your own conclusions," said
the faithful servant, "I shall simply relate facts.</p>

<p>"As soon as at bed-time with Euphrosyne's
bodice her nimble tongue was let loose, and the
nightly hour arrived for reviewing the occurrences
of the day, you came on the <i>tapis;</i>&mdash;for
on either side it would have seemed suspicious
not to notice so remarkable an incident as that
which interrupted the gambols of the morning.
'You know the person, by whom we were thus
surprised,' said I, significantly.</p>

<p>" 'No,' replied Euphrosyne; and wondered that
I should be able to remove her ignorance.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

<p>" 'That is no fault of mine,' I rejoined, 'when
our good or evil stars have made the intruder a
friend of your cousin's, and a visitor at our house.
Had I however conceived the possibility of our
meeting so dangerous a youth in so secluded a spot,
we should have directed our walk elsewhere. They
say it is impossible to behold this Moslemin, and
to refrain from loving him.'</p>

<p>" 'Nonsense!' cried Euphrosyne, with a forced
laugh and an involuntary sigh.</p>

<p>" 'Nonsense it probably is,'&mdash;resumed I, in a
careless manner&mdash;'though I might, if I pleased,
add what certainly deserves not that name.'</p>

<p>" 'How?' cried Chrysopulo's cousin precipitately;&mdash;but 
immediately again checking herself, 'No,'
added she, 'do not tell me: it is no business of
mine!'</p>

<p>" 'Indeed I would not tell you, even though
you should entreat me,' was my reply, 'unless you
made me a solemn promise that I never should
have cause to regret my too ready frankness.'</p>

<p>"Euphrosyne now began to apprehend that the
silence she had exacted might look like want of
confidence in her own steadiness. 'I make the
promise you require,' said she, 'but merely lest
you should fancy I fear any danger from your indiscretion.'</p>

<p>"I then told the blushing girl that you had seen
her, and suffered for her all the pangs of the most

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

ardent love. Emboldened by the silence with which
this disclosure was received, I even went so far as
to enlarge on your merits; but soon I found that
agitation alone stopped the trembling maiden's
breath. My comment gave her time to recover.
Having however suffered me to begin the encomium
unimpeded, she allowed me to conclude my speech
unchecked, in order that her not cutting it short
from the first might seem done with design. It
was only when I no longer knew what to say, and
hemmed as for an answer, that I was asked with
an affected composure, to what all this was to lead?</p>

<p>"I felt disconcerted, and Euphrosyne, after
waiting a few seconds, desired I might not trouble
myself to seek a reply: 'she must,' she said, 'inform
her relations of my improper conversation.'
I could only make her desist from this intention by
recalling her promise."</p>

<p>This detail of Sophia's, however, sufficed to convince
me (perhaps without just foundation) that the
shaft which I had aimed at Euphrosyne's heart
had not recoiled wholly unfelt,&mdash;that it had made
some slight impression;&mdash;and I was going to propose
further measures founded on this supposition,
when a tremendous noise at the door of my lodging
announced the riotous entrance of all my bosom
friends. I had only time to thrust my accomplice
into my back room, and went out to meet the jolly
party. So loud were the inquiries from all quarters

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

respecting the progress of my love affair, that,
terrified lest Sophia should hear them, and feel deterred
from her perilous purpose, I tried to entice
the troop away by running down stairs the first.
The whole procession immediately followed; to my
great relief again sallied forth, with myself, into the
street; and proposed a morning lounge on the quay,
in which&mdash;disposed or not&mdash;I was forced to join:
it however gave Sophia an opportunity of slipping
away unperceived.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the morning I could
think of nothing but Euphrosyne. From not feeling
any desire to behold my charmer's features, I
now was unable, from what I already had seen and
heard, to rest until I had obtained of her beauties a
full and unrestrained view. The day happened to
be a Greek festival. In the evening, by calling at
Chrysopulo's and entering unannounced, I was sure
to find the whole family collected.&mdash;I determined
to risk the adventure.</p>

<p>The peals of merriment which resounded through
the house, both guided my footsteps and drowned
the noise of my approach. I entered unperceived
into the very place of entertainment. Euphrosyne,
seated in her costliest attire at the further end of
the hall, had just begun to recount&mdash;half in speech,
half in still more expressive pantomime&mdash;a playful
story. Every eye and ear, riveted on her performance,
was turned away from the door, and I had

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

already advanced a considerable way into the room
before my visit was perceived. When indeed my
presence became noticed, such was the sensation
it created, that a kite could scarce have made a
greater on alighting among the timid tenants of the
poultry yard. All the females set up a warning
shout, rushed forward, threw a veil over Euphrosyne's
still unconscious face, and formed round
her person an impenetrable fence. The merry tale
with which the thoughtless girl was entertaining the
company immediately ceased; the magician whom
she was in the act of killing with her bodkin remained
alive to do his mischief, and, in the confusion
which pervaded the assembly, her own form&mdash;as
if conjured away by witchcraft&mdash;rapidly vanished
from my searching sight.</p>

<p>But it was too late: I had seen, and I had heard!
One single glance of her languishing black eyes
had, from underneath her silken eyelashes, met my
own inquiring look; while, at the same time, one
last expiring note of her soft melodious voice had,
from her ambrosial lip, dropped upon my outstretched
ear; and if the former had sunk like
liquid fire into my heart's inmost core, the other
continued to vibrate, like the last dying note of the
lyre, on my maddened brain.</p>

<p>All the powers of language were of course called
in requisition to express the inexpressible pleasure
derived by the Greek party from my unexpected

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

visit. While the only object of my intrusion was
most studiously kept out of sight, I was with the
most indefatigable industry made welcome to every
thing else in the house that could be named or
thought of: was introduced to every individual I
did not care to know, and was offered every dainty
I did not wish to taste.</p>

<p>A statue could not have shown less sense of
these unbounded civilities.&mdash;Fascinated, and fixed
in that same spot which had so lately felt the pressure
of Euphrosyne's lovely form, I had not the
power to speak, nor even to take leave and retire,
till fairly wished by every person present, where
indeed of my own accord I was going fast enough.</p>

<p>Having with faltering step reached my house, I
there yielded myself up body and soul to my new
phrensy. Only after musing over the dying embers
of my mangal<sup id="r273"><a href="#n273">273</a></sup> until my lamp burnt dim did I seek
my lonely couch. I then undressed and went to
bed; but went not to repose. Instead of blood,
unquenchable flames seemed to flow through my
veins; and, racked in every joint by the rage of a
passion become more hopeless in proportion as it
was become more ardent, I tossed about all night,
trying to grasp my fair one's unsubstantial image.
At last, exhausted by the fruitless efforts to give
body and colour to the delusive phantom, all power
of thought forsook me, and I sunk into a state, not
of sleep, but of half conscious half insensible torpor.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

<p>I rose with the lark, though not as blithe; and
counted the slowly passing hours until Sophia was
to come. I panted for the appearance of my confidante,
no longer as before merely to consult her,
but to talk of, to expatiate upon, to rave about
Euphrosyne!</p>

<p>In vain I waited and waited; and at every footstep
in the street, and at every rap at the door, and
at every noise on the stairs, flew out to meet my
wingless Iris. The faithless messenger came not at
the time appointed; she came not after; she came
not at all! Nor did note or message come in her
stead, to account for her ill-timed non-appearance.</p>

<p>I would have gone, if I durst, to the house
blessed by my angel's residence. I did all I could:
I walked all day long in sight of its entrance; I
watched all that went in, and all that went out. I
kept myself in readiness, the moment Sophia appeared,
to pounce like a hawk upon the dilatory
suivante; but no Sophia appeared in any shape!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, every possible mode of ingratiating
myself with the heavenly Euphrosyne passed through
my, alas! less heavenly mind. According as the
maiden might be more or less sensible of the charms
of gold, or accessible to the lures of vanity, or
charitable or devout, the mere glitter of St. Mark's
dazzling images,<sup id="r274"><a href="#n274">274</a></sup> or the glory of beholding the
haughty Selim at her feet, or the pride of making
him promise a thorough reformation, or the hope of

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

saving his falling soul from perdition, might be tried,
I thought, as bribes to win her affections: but, which
of these motives for listening to my suit would find
the easiest admission into my charmer's heart, and
what were the virtues or the faults in her disposition
which might be rendered most propitious to
my views, remained to me a secret; for, while the
sun continued to light up this hemisphere (and in
wonder at my behaviour the bright orb of day certainly
more than once forgot to move) my traitress
of a waiting-woman darkened not my door with her
slender shadow.</p>

<p>At dusk, however, and just as I was returning
home entirely hopeless, the well known form brushed
by me. I followed it to a retired spot, where precipitately
turning round as if afraid to waste time:
"What have you done!" exclaimed the agitated
suivante; "Why would you show yourself in the
only place from which you should have stayed away?"</p>

<p>"Only," answered I, "to see the lady whom I
was making love to."</p>

<p>"And so," rejoined Sophia, "to lose her for
ever, as you now inevitably must: for your abrupt
visit last night has had the effect of producing all
that you could have wished to prevent. The period
of the nuptials, uncertain before, is now fixed for
to-morrow."</p>

<p>A short struggle in my breast kept my answer
during a few seconds suspended on my lips:&mdash;at last,

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

with one concluding but victorious effort: "Sophia,"
replied I, "my resolution is fixed! While I knew
not Euphrosyne, while I yet felt no preference for
that angel of heaven, come on purpose to gladden
this paltry earth, I could regard her destruction as
my sport; but I have beheld the lovely girl, and
have fallen into my own thrice cursed snare. Her
innocent looks have melted the hardness of my heart.
I no longer can bear to blast like the simoom the
fair and lovely floweret. I am now ready to perform
any sacrifice for the permanent possession of its
sweets:&mdash;for a possession that may make me happy,
without inflicting ruin on the object of my flame. I
shall attach her to my fate through the holy ties of
wedlock. It is but paying a few sums which I deserve
to lose, and feeding afterwards&mdash;as I shall
have to do&mdash;upon love alone!"</p>

<p>Sophia here set up a hellish laugh. As soon as
the burst was over: "and so you think," cried she,
"that all is to be settled to your liking by this magnanimous
resolve,&mdash;that you have nothing more to
do but to announce your pleasure, and take away
your bride! Allow me to undeceive you. Euphrosyne's
relations are rich, they are proud, and they are
bigoted. Under no circumstances whatever would
they suffer a kinswoman of theirs to marry a mohammedan.
No&mdash;not if the Sultan himself were come
in person to demand her. Then judge whether
you have a chance; and that, with the faith of the

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

whole family pledged to a wealthy young Greek,
and ready to tie the nuptial knot! Believe me, if
you should ever wish Hymen ultimately to crown
your flame, you must begin by rendering your success
independent of that squeamish deity."</p>

<p>"Sophia," resumed I, "once more let me repeat
to you that my resolution is fixed. Adoring
Euphrosyne as I do, nothing shall induce me to
rob her existence of its bloom, her life of its lasting
pride. For once I shall subdue my lawless passions;
I shall pay the forfeit of my idle boastings.
If, after making sacrifices to her virtue and her
peace so weighty as those of all fortune's valued
gifts, and all love's unfettered raptures, she accepts
me for her husband, well and good! Luxuries she
will not find, but affection in abundance. If, on
the contrary, she reject me: patience! For once
in my life I shall have done what was right, at
the expense of my vanity, my fortune, and my
happiness."</p>

<p>Sophia at these words turned pale. She seemed
to labour with a fearful secret; but seeing me determined:
"Man," cried she at last, "listen to woman,
but let not woman deceive you any longer. Fear
not to despoil what has ceased to exist. I have
hitherto felt loth to disclose the dark mystery, but
rather than that I should suffer you to become the
sport of an arrogant family and the subject of a
solemn mockery, I shall reveal to you all&mdash;all that

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

remains hitherto a secret from a prying world.
Learn therefore that you no longer are in time to
make on too tender a heart the first unlawful impression!
Hot kisses have already pressed her lips,
for whose embrace you resign yourself to an unavailing
martyrdom. The plant still flourishes green
and gay; but other hands have culled the blossom."</p>

<p>Here Sophia put her mouth to my ear. I felt
as if a snake crept into its folds, and deeply sunk
within my heart the venom of her frightful story.
"As, however," added my confidante, after her tale
had curdled my best blood at its very source,&mdash;"the
unlucky occurrence has hitherto been kept concealed,
they tremble with impatience to conclude
so desirable a match, ere it be suspected by the
party concerned."</p>

<p>"And this," exclaimed I, "is the conclusion of
all my love; and innocence and purity then exist
not on earth! Even where one would wish to
worship them as things sacred&mdash;things to be gazed
upon, not approached&mdash;they elude one's keenest
search; and woman's licentiousness outstrips the
thoughts of man! Oh that a bud so fair, so young,
should already contain the foul worm of corruption
in its bosom! that another should already have
rioted unrestrained in what with such painful struggles
Anastasius himself was going to give up wholly

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

from virtuous motives!" And in my wrath I resolved
no longer to sacrifice both pleasure and fortune
to the shadow of an undeserved reputation.
I resolved to resume the before abandoned scheme,
no longer from love but from sheer resentment: at
the same time binding Sophia by all that was most
awful never to divulge the odious secret; lest by its
publication I should be prevented from reaping my
golden harvest, as I had already been outstripped
in gathering a wreath far dearer and more valued.</p>

<p>When however&mdash;the first ebullition over&mdash;I reconsidered
the matter, the thought struck me that
Sophia had only disclosed her mistress's secret
shame from a fiendlike greediness, and in order not
to lose the promised reward; and carrying this reflection
somewhat further, I now conceived it possible
that a motive which seemed to reign with such unrestraint
in this unworthy servant's breast, might
have made her invent what she pretended to divulge.
Hereupon all my waverings returned, and at last&mdash;determined
to prefer the chance of erring to that of
incurring endless guilt&mdash;I reverted to my prior resolution
of giving up the pursuit: nay, from fear
of fresh relapses, when I saw my informer preparing
to call with a sanctified air the whole host
of heaven as witnesses to her veracity, I stopped
both my ears, and bravely ran away. The moment
my astonished informer found her endeavours unavailing

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

to persuade, or even, to bring me back, her
oaths, methought, changed to curses; but these&mdash;uttered
when already I was in full flight&mdash;died away
on the distant breeze.</p>

<p>Half pleased half angry with myself for my forbearance,
I walked about the town, shunning my
friends to whom I had nothing to impart but what
must gladden them at my expense, and seriously
considering whether, both for the sake of their
morals and my purse, I should not by a sudden
evolution quit them and Smyrna for ever, when,
in the midst of my meditations, a messenger&mdash;of
those that ply about the streets in search of commissions&mdash;struck
me on the breast with a small
bunch of flowers.</p>

<p>Skilled in the meaning of these mute heralds of
love, I snatched the nosegay out of the rude hands
by which it seemed profaned; but when I came to
consider its arrangement, I found that all I had to
learn had not been left to the vague language of
the pink and gillyflower: their fragrant leaves concealed
a note, and this note contained a lock of hair
and a ring.</p>

<p>Eagerly I perused the billet. It began with reproaches.
They were, however, of a nature to be
endured: "not less painful to a lady was the task
of making the last advances than the first; and,
were not the very morrow to bring the fatal hour,
when what had not been might never more be, no

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

consideration would have induced the writer to trust
her feelings to paper, or to inform me that a passage
separated from the chamber of the married couple
the maiden's closet; that this closet looked out upon
a garden; and that this garden was only divided
from the street by a low wall. Sometimes,"&mdash;added
a wary postscript&mdash;"careless servants would
leave shutters unbolted: but always a sober family
went to rest before twelve!"</p>

<p>Euphrosyne's handwriting I was a stranger to:
and this note probably had only been penned by
deputy; though couched in better terms than those
generally used by servants: but, in how far the
professions of the maid had the sanction of the
mistress, it was easy to try, and by an unerring
test; and the difference between two thousand sequins
to pay, or that sum to receive, made it well
worth the while. Nor was there any time to be lost.
The very next day&mdash;as the note itself suggested&mdash;would
be too late for the experiment. Should I
find the passage barred, it was but returning as I
went. Why however suspect Sophia of risking a
falsehood, which, as such, could not command success,
must soon be discovered, and must end in her
disgrace? For as to the idea of her scheming a plot
to betray me to Chrysopulo, though it had entered
my brain, I held it not worthy of a moment's
thought. I therefore determined to obey the welcome
summons.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

<p>Ten minutes before the hour appointed my pistols
were loaded, and my person lightened of all useless
incumbrance. Wrapped up in my capote I sallied
forth, found all things disposed according to promise,
easily scaled the wall, had only to push open
the blinds, and leaped into the chamber of love,
where, half covered only by a light Barbary ha&iuml;ck,<sup id="r275"><a href="#n275">275</a></sup>
Euphrosyne lay, apparently unconscious of aught
but the dreams that might engage her youthful
fancy. So sweet indeed seemed her slumbers, that,
but for irresistible evidence to the contrary, they
might have been mistaken for those of innocence,
and once more made me hesitate for a moment ere I
threw off my cloak, deposited my pistols, and extinguished
the lamp.</p>

<p>If at first the real or pretended sleep of my mistress
somewhat surprised me, if that surprise grew
greater at its long continuance; what was my astonishment
when Euphrosyne at last only awoke to
start from my embrace, and to utter loud screams,
which the pressure of my hand was hardly able to
stifle.</p>

<p>Her outcry had been heard ere it could be stopped.
Chrysopulo himself had already quitted his
consort's balmy side, and, with the carbine which
he always kept loaded, had run to whence proceeded
the sound. With one effort he burst open the door
of the closet.</p>

<p>Already I was standing near its threshold bolt

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

upright, with my capote on and my pistol pointed.
In the dark the merchant mistook me for a robber:
he fired his piece, and missed.</p>

<p>I now put mine to his breast. "All I wish,"
cried I, "is to make you listen. If you value your
cousin's honour, favour my escape, and pretend that
you were dreaming,&mdash;as indeed you should have
been."</p>

<p>Chrysopulo, thus enlightened, now trembled with
rage. His eyes glistened amid surrounding darkness
like those of a maddened tiger. Yet, uncertain
how to act, he remained motionless where he stood,
while Euphrosyne, mute with shame and despair,
was only heard striving to suppress her bitter sobs.
Meanwhile the report of the musket had roused
the whole family. Chrysopulo's wife was crying
"murder" in her bed, the servants starting up from
their first sleep, and the people that passed by in the
street knocking at the door until every beam shook
in the house. Each instant the noise increased and
the uproar came nearer. Another minute, and the
immediate scene of action must witness a general
irruption.</p>

<p>Chrysopulo now became sensible of the wisdom of
my suggestion. Rousing himself from his trance
and pointing to the window, "Away, away!" he
cried; but cried too late. Already a number of
voices sent forth a confused murmur from the identical
spot in the garden on which I must have

<!-- vol 3 page 53 -->

alighted. Chrysopulo looked whether I might slip
under his cousin's couch:&mdash;it was too low; or whether
upon her wardrobe:&mdash;it was too high.</p>

<p>Aghast, we now stared at each other, until in his
perplexity the trembling banker&mdash;for want of a
better expedient&mdash;pushed me down in a corner of
the room, and there,&mdash;tearing from off Euphrosyne's
own couch its light covering, turned it into
a cloak to my person and my guilt.</p>

<p>Just at this moment rushed in the whole posse.
A thousand questions succeeded each other without
intermission, and, all circumstances considered, the
story which Chrysopulo told in answer was sufficiently
plausible. Euphrosyne's terror and confusion,
with the other apparent objects of the scene,
might without any great stretch of probability be
attributed to her cousin's mistake; and the whole
terminated to the satisfaction or rather dissatisfaction
of the curious, who, fully expecting a long list
of dreadful murders, were seemingly somewhat
wroth at being put off with a bad dream, and went
away wishing the rich Chrysopulo worse suppers,
or a better digestion.</p>

<p>Meantime, seeing so many people rush by her
door, Chrysopulo's wife herself had mustered up
courage to follow the crowd. Being the last to come,
she was the last to depart; or rather, she had a mind
not to go away at all, and insisted on staying, in
order to tranquillize her fair cousin's agitation. She

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

mistrusted her husband's dream, and wanted to sift
his conduct to the bottom: wherefore the alarmed
Chrysopulo, unable to confide in her discretion, at
once resolved to conquer her resistance by force.
He took her by the arm, dragged her out of the
room, and, lest she should return to listen, locked
her up in her own chamber.</p>

<p>If, fearless myself, I had only reluctantly acted
the coward for the sake of others, and had more
than once felt tempted, while the mob remained assembled,
to start up, to show myself, and to carry
away as a trophy of my victory the instrument of
my concealment, I now, when the coast was clear
and the way open for my own retreat, felt equally
desirous of staying, and that, with views somewhat
similar to those of Chrysopulo's wife,&mdash;namely, to
obtain an explanation of a few circumstances not
quite intelligible even to the framer of the plot:
but for an inquiry of this sort neither the time nor
place were fitted; and fresh noises at the door made
me run without further delay to the still open window.
I thence leaped into the garden, overset or
trampled down every flower and vegetable in my
way, and, after climbing the wall, got safe into the
street, and back to my lonely lodging. There I
lay down and began to reflect on the inconstancy
of women, who, after sending flattering invitations,
scream out as at a rudeness on finding them accepted,&mdash;till
at last all my bewildered thoughts were

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

hushed in sleep. The next morning, on awaking
in my own bed, with every object around me as
orderly and tranquil as the day before, it seemed
as if during the whole of the eventful night I had
never quitted my solitary pillow!</p>

<p>The first circumstance which afforded me distinct
evidence of having trespassed on premises not my
own, was Chrysopulo suddenly standing before me,
as, still undressed, I lay on my couch revolving in
my mind all my strange adventures. Determined
to brave what could not be denied, I thanked him
for the honour of his early inquiries and begged
he would be seated. He took little notice of these
insolent civilities, but immediately coming to the
point, "You have offered to a hitherto unsullied
house," said he, "the cruellest of injuries. How
far you have succeeded I neither know nor can
bear to inquire. Should your baseness have been
disappointed, the fault is not yours: yet, much
as I am bound to abhor you, I must stoop to a
request."</p>

<p>"Speak," said I; "a petition so agreeably introduced
can scarcely meet with a refusal."</p>

<p>"Your crime," answered Chrysopulo, "is thus
far only known to ourselves, and to whatever vile
abettor of your wickedness may reside under our
roof. Even Euphrosyne's intended husband presumes
not to cast upon his future consort the smallest
shadow of blame, or wishes to defer the long

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

concerted nuptials. Humbly therefore let me entreat,
that out of compassion for the object&mdash;the
unfortunate object of your lawless violence&mdash;you
will not carry your cruelty any further, or be so
devoid of mercy as to boast of your base attempts.
Divulge not the foul stain which you destined our
house! Thus may we still hold up our heads
among our envious countrymen; and the unhappy
Euphrosyne still preserve both her husband and
her honour."</p>

<p>Moved by an entreaty so earnest and so discreet,
I wholly forgot that the crime of which I stood accused
had only been undertaken for the very purpose
of being boasted of; felt all at once as anxious
as Chrysopulo to prevent its further consequences,
and made every promise required by the merchant
to quiet his fears. Greatly relieved by my assurances,
he almost thanked me for my goodness,
and was going to repay it by an unlimited credit on
his house, but, having fortunately restrained just in
time this excess of gratitude, returned home with a
mind more composed and at ease.</p>

<p>But as soon as he was gone it recurred to my
thoughts, that the engagement I had taken must
defeat the whole object of my achievement, and
must silence all those claims on my companions for
which I had thus laboured;&mdash;nay, that unless I published
my victory, I must not only renounce what I
had won, but pay what I had not lost;&mdash;that I must

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

part with my whole earthly fortune,&mdash;<i>that</i> in actual
possession as well as <i>that</i> in expectancy; and part
with both for a fair one, who, even prior to the
commencement of my homage, had no longer kept
in store any remnant of virtue, through the sacrifice
of which to console me for the riches thus renounced
on her account. Consistent with the terms of my
precipitate promise, I could not even divulge my
success, after the object of my silence had been fully
attained.</p>

<p>Deeply regretting my imprudence and loudly
cursing my good nature, I paced up and down my
room half dressed, and expecting every moment
to see Sophia come and claim her vile, her now
bootless reward; until tired at last of waiting, and
attributing her delay to the bustle of the day, I
proceeded to achieve my often interrupted toilet.
Once indeed a slight temptation came across me to
honour the wedding with my presence,&mdash;to blast it
with my breath!&mdash;but I still had some grace left,
and contented myself with awaiting at home in the
utmost anxiety, the news of the nuptials being happily
completed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> scarcely given the last twist to my turban,
when a distant clamour in the street drew me to the
window, and made me espy a veiled female, whose
uncertain gait and faltering steps had attracted the
notice of a troop of foolish boys, and made them
follow her with loud hootings. It was impossible
not to set down in my mind one so carefully wrapped
up and so fearful of being recognised, as the partner
of my guilt, coming to demand the wages of her
iniquity; and all that baffled my utmost power of
conjecture was the change from Sophia's wonted
boldness of demeanour, to the apparent timidity and
helplessness palpably manifested by my approaching
visitor. I could only attribute the phenomenon to
Sophia's dismissal from Chrysopulo's family, branded
with the marks of public disgrace; on which account
I immediately sallied forth to offer her a safe-conduct
to my abode. My surprise still increased,
when, tendering my ally the protection of my arm, I
first saw her hesitate, then shuddering withdraw her
hand already clasped in mine, and at last only suffer
herself to be dragged into my habitation, after
the terror produced by the insults of the gathering
mob had as it were entirely deprived her of consciousness;
but my astonishment only rose to its

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

highest pitch, when, tearing off the cumbrous veils,
in order to give the fainting maiden some air, I
beheld, instead of the daring Sophia, the gentle,
the reserved Euphrosyne herself, who scarcely on
recovering her senses had time to cast her eyes
around her, ere, again sinking down to the ground,
she struck her face against the floor, and began
wringing her hands with every symptom of the
bitterest anguish.</p>

<p>The cause of her having quitted her home I was
at a loss to conjecture, but the effect it had of bringing
her to mine I hailed at first as a highly fortunate
circumstance. Thus would my triumph be
blazoned forth without my word being broken.
When however I witnessed the excess of my fair
one's grief, contrasted as it was with my own joy, I
too felt moved, tried to assuage her sorrow by every
expression of pity and concern, and, as soon as she
seemed able to speak, ventured to inquire what had
caused her coming forth thus unattended and forlorn,
at the very time when I supposed all Smyrna
collected to witness her brilliant nuptials?</p>

<p>"My nuptials," echoed she with a smile of bitterness,&mdash;now
first suffering her voice to strike my ear,&mdash;"when
my dishonour is the universal theme!</p>

<p>"The universal theme!" repeated I,&mdash;truly dismayed
in my turn. "Then may heaven's direst
curse alight upon her who has divulged it!"</p>

<p>"That was myself," replied Euphrosyne, "and
your curse has struck home!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

<p>I remained mute with surprise.</p>

<p>"Could I," rejoined my mistress, "to dishonour
add deceit? Could I bring a dower of infamy to the
man so noble, so generous, that even after my frightful
tale he spurned me not away from him;&mdash;to the
man who deigned in pity to affirm, that my avowal
of my involuntary shame rendered me worthier in
his eyes, and gave him a stronger assurance of my
fidelity, than if I had come to his arms as spotless
in body as in mind?"</p>

<p>"And who," added I, "after this sublime speech,
ended by rejecting you."</p>

<p>"Ah no!" cried Euphrosyne, "it was I who
rejected him: it was I who refused to carry reproach
into the house of a stranger, and who for that
crime was threatened by my own friends with being
cast off, and thrown upon the wide world, helpless
and unprotected!&mdash;But," added she, covering her
face with her hands, and sobbing more bitterly than
before, "I suffered not the threat to grow into a
reality; I waited not to be turned out of doors. I
resolved at once upon the only step which was left
me; I asked permission to go to our church, in order
that in my fervent prayers heaven might inspire me
how to act, and, when alone and in the street, tried
to find out your abode, and to seek refuge where
alone I had claims."</p>

<p>"What then!" exclaimed I, "from your very
threshold you had determined&mdash;whatever happened&mdash;to
cross mine? and it was not the shouts of the

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

mob only . . . . . . . ? I fancied that I felt you shrinking
from my touch, when, in compassion, I seized
hold of your hand."</p>

<p>"And could I execute the resolve which I have
owned, and not shudder at the thoughts of its
baleful consequences?"</p>

<p>These now began to present themselves to my
own mind also, in long and fearful array. At first,
indeed, the surprise on beholding Euphrosyne thus
unexpectedly, the consciousness of my own iniquities,
the exultation at seeing its triumph sealed
without the smallest violation of my promise, and
the sympathy excited by my mistress's evident sufferings,
together with a thousand other mixed and
indescribable sensations, had induced a momentary
forgetfulness of all those reports against Euphrosyne's
character which had encouraged me to prosecute
my plan, had made that plan receive its fulfilment,
and had in their turn been confirmed by
my very success. But on hearing not only of an
act so uncalled for as Euphrosyne's spontaneous
disclosure of her shame, so wanton as her refusal
of her still urging suitor, and so strange as her
deliberately leaving her husband for her despoiler,
the truth&mdash;dimmed for a moment&mdash;seemed again
to burst upon me, and with increased evidence. I
now conceived that even my crime might only
be the pretence, rather than the real reason of
Euphrosyne's renouncing an advantageous match.

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

Her former dishonour again rising to my mind,
lent even her present conduct the colouring of artifice;
and if I thought it hard upon me that an assignation
proposed by my mistress herself&mdash;and that
assignation too, proposed by her as not only the
first but also the last for which I could hope&mdash;should
end in her inflicting upon me the burthen of her
permanent support, I thought it harder still to be
thus heavily visited in consequence of the sins of
others. That shelter, therefore, which I had gladly
granted Euphrosyne, while it only seemed accidental
and transient, I now began to grudge her when it
appeared purposely sought as the beginning only
of a sojourn which was to have no end; and the
burthen of this permanent society was what I determined
to ward off to the utmost of my power.</p>

<p>To give my real reasons for so doing was impossible.
On reviewing every past circumstance, I
felt that from the first wording of the assignation
to the close of the interview the successive incidents
had been so conducted as to leave me, with every
presumptive evidence, not one positive proof of
Euphrosyne's having given her consent to my stolen
pleasures. No argument against my compliance with
her wishes, founded upon her complying too readily
with mine&mdash;however valid in itself&mdash;I therefore
knew would be admitted: and, as to the report of
her prior guilt with others,&mdash;even my own vanity
shrunk from suffering an imputation so odious to

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

lessen the merit of my victory, or the value of my
prize: besides, I read in the streaming eyes piteously
fixed on mine, pangs too acute still to increase them
by a reproach, which must inflict equal agony whether
just or unfounded. Appearing therefore to speak
more from tenderness for her whom I addressed
than for myself, "Euphrosyne," said I, "it was
unwise, methinks, to divulge what but for your
own spontaneous avowal might have remained an
inscrutable secret; it was a thousand times more
unwise still, when you found that by an unexampled
privilege this deterred not your suitor,
yourself to refuse him; but it seems to me the very
height of folly willingly to court every form of disgrace,
where, as it appears, you still may enjoy every
species of distinction. You cannot justify your
conduct in casting without necessity such a stain
upon your family. Hasten then to repair the mischief
while you still are in time; return home immediately,
as if you had only offered up an hurried
prayer in church, and obviate by your ready acceptance
of the worthy Argyropoli all the impending consequences
of your thoughtless and precipitate step."</p>

<p>Alas! I addressed one who, wholly bewildered
by her own feelings, heeded not, perhaps heard not
my words. Euphrosyne, fixing upon me an eye at
once vacant and supplicating, continued to preserve
an unbroken, and, as I thought, stubborn silence,
until at last I deemed it necessary to use terms more

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

decisive and peremptory. Taking two or three
hasty strides across the room, as if still to increase
the ferment of my already heated blood: "Euphrosyne,"
cried I, "it is impossible you can stay with
me. I myself am a wanderer on the face of the
globe,&mdash;to-day here, to-morrow perhaps flying to
the earth's furthest extremity. Your remaining
under my uncertain roof can only end in total ruin
to us both. I must insist upon your quitting my
abode, ere your own be no longer accessible to your
tardy repentance."</p>

<p>"Ah no!" now cried Euphrosyne, convulsively
clasping my knees: "be not so barbarous! Shut not
your own door against her, against whom you have
barred every once friendly door. Do not deny her
whom you have dishonoured the only asylum she
has left. If I cannot be your wife, let me be your
slave, your drudge. No service, however mean, shall
I recoil from when you command. At least before
you I shall not have to blush. In your eyes I shall
not be what I must seem in those of others: I shall
not from you incur the contempt, which I must expect
from my former companions; and my diligence
to execute the lowest offices you may require will
earn for me, not wholly as a bare alms at your hands,
that support which, however scanty, I can elsewhere
only receive as an unmerited indulgence. Since I
did a few days please your eye, I may still please it
a few days longer:&mdash;perhaps a few days longer

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

therefore I may still wish to live; and when that
last blessing, your love, is gone by,&mdash;when my cheek,
faded with grief, has lost the last attraction that
could arrest your favour, then speak, then tell me
so, that, burthening you no longer, I may retire&mdash;and
die!"</p>

<p>Spite of the tears of sincere sympathy with which
I answered this speech, the conviction that all might
still be by diligence hushed up, was going to make
me urge more strenuously than before Euphrosyne's
immediate return,&mdash;when a new incident took
place, which wholly changed my inclinations and
my feelings.</p>

<p>This was no less than a sudden and forcible
invasion of my lodgings by the maiden's relations.
It had soon been discovered by them, that, instead
of going to church, she had come to my abode;
and her friends had thereupon walked forth in a
body to claim the stray lamb, and to carry it back
to the fold. Chrysopulo himself indeed was not
of the party: it only consisted of half a dozen of
his first and second cousins;&mdash;but this posse broke
in upon me unceremoniously enough, just as I was
urging my mistress by every motive in heaven and
upon earth, not to delay her departure another
minute, and immediately proceeded to effect by
force, what I was only trying to obtain by persuasion.</p>

<p>My readers already know how little I liked the

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

interference of strangers in my concerns, and how
apt I was to act in opposition to their wishes and
counsels, from no other motive but to assert my independence
or to show my daring: they will not
therefore be much surprised to hear that this unlooked-for
incident caused a sudden and entire
revolution in my sentiments, and that, from wishing
Euphrosyne to go, while she expressed a wish to
stay, I now would have detained her by force, even
if she had wished to go. Taking hold, therefore, of
the maiden by one arm, while Chrysopulo's friends
were pulling her away by the other, I swore that
nothing short of death should make me give up a
persecuted angel, which had thought fit to seek my
protection; and as Euphrosyne herself, when appealed
to, seemed to sanction my proceedings, by
drawing her veil over her blushing features, her
friends were at last induced, by the persuasive
gestures which accompanied my words, to give up
all further attempts at violent measures.</p>

<p>In truth, they rejoiced in their vile hearts at having
it to say, that an insurmountable resistance had
baffled all their efforts. Euphrosyne had early been
left an orphan: her nearest of kin were all dead;
and, though the more distant relations to whose lot
it fell to protect her, would have upheld their fair
cousin most sedulously in the world, while they had
any chance of deriving an additional lustre from
her establishment, they were willing enough to drop

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

the connexion, as soon as her situation was likely to
reflect discredit on their name. However loud and
boisterous therefore might be the wish they expressed
of restoring the fugitive to her family, there lurked
not the less satisfaction at the bottom when they
found her resolved not to go: and while they pretended
to feel exceedingly hurt at Euphrosyne's refusal,
they took her at her word with the utmost
alacrity, or rather, suffered her mere silence to stand
for a denial. Devoutly lifting up their eyes to heaven,
and drawing discordant groans from their flinty bosoms,
they turned away from one whom they saw so
irreclaimably abandoned, and hurried out of the
house, lest she should change her mind ere they were
out of hearing. When however they found themselves
safe, as they thought, in the street, they stopped
to announce for the benefit of all who passed by their
determination to renounce so unworthy a namesake.
Thenceforth they were to regard the nameless profligate
as among the departed, and, happen what
might, never more to inquire after her fate; and to
their credit be it spoken, they adhered in that instance
most religiously to their humane and pious vow.</p>

<p>My undisturbed possession of Chrysopulo's fair
cousin therefore was now a matter settled; and the
lofty, the admired Euphrosyne, who that very
morning might still have beheld all Smyrna at her
feet, saw herself before mid-day installed in the

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

lodging of a roving adventurer, as his avowed and
public mistress!</p>

<p>Of her maid Sophia the lovely girl could give no
account. While Chrysopulo continued in hopes
of seeing the affair hushed up, he abstained from
rousing the anger of this fiend, by expressing his
suspicions: but the moment Euphrosyne herself
had made public her adventure, Sophia, no longer
feeling safe in the family, had disappeared: nor had
she since been heard of;&mdash;but her louring fate was
the least of my cares.</p>

<p>The foremost at present was the payment of the
sums I had won. The addition to my establishment
permitted me not to be unmindful of my interests.
As soon therefore as I had said and performed
whatever seemed most calculated to dispel Euphrosyne's
settled gloom, I immediately walked to the
meeting place of our society, and found its members
in council assembled.</p>

<p>My first salutation was a demand upon each:
but, to my unutterable dismay, the first answer was
a loud and universal burst of laughter at my presumption.
As soon as this peal of merriment had
subsided a little, I was told that I might think myself
well off in having nothing to pay instead of to
receive; and, on demanding a further explanation,
I learnt that the infernal Sophia had been beforehand
with me, and, the instant she left the house of

<!-- vol 3 page 69 -->

Chrysopulo, had gone round to all my companions,
in the first place indeed to inform them of my success
with Euphrosyne, but, in the next, to comfort
them with the assurance that neither my vanity nor
my fortune could derive any advantage from my
triumph, as it had only been the consequence of my
fair one's prior frailties,&mdash;of those frailties which
my confidant had solemnly sworn to me never to
divulge. Every person present therefore immediately
called out "a drawn wager!" and I was
deemed disqualified from claiming a single para!</p>

<p>What could I do with a bad cause, and a parcel
of fellows each to the full as sturdy as myself? Only
this: to renounce with a good grace what I clearly
saw I should never obtain, and to join in the laugh
at my own impudence; "of which," I observed, "it
was worth while at any rate to try the effect."</p>

<p>But tolerably as I had contrived to preserve my
good humour with my strapping companions, the
case became different when, returning to Euphrosyne,
I met Sophia coming at full speed, to receive
from those who had just mocked me the reward of
her treachery.</p>

<p>Great as was the disappointment experienced in
my purse, it seemed nothing to the wound inflicted
on my pride. The fate of a lovely female had been
connected with mine by links even more indissoluble
than those of matrimony, since a divorce could
not restore her to her home,&mdash;and this partner of

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

my life had been branded with infamy;&mdash;and by
her in whom she had most confided!&mdash;The insulting
epithets still rung in my ear, which had been
showered on my mistress through the spite of the
infernal Sophia.</p>

<p>So conscious indeed was this wicked girl of her
iniquity, that, far from seeming to harbour any
thoughts of enforcing her still unsettled claims on
her first employer, the moment I appeared in her
sight she tried to make her escape,&mdash;but it was too
late!</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried I, "thus then you have performed
your promise. Now behold in what way I
perform mine!" And hereupon I seized her by the
wrist, and retorting upon her, in the midst of the
gaping crowd, every disgraceful epithet which her
malignancy had drawn down upon Euphrosyne. I
terrified the vile woman unto fainting, and then left
her to recover in the filth of Smyrna's foulest kennel!
Thanks to this cool immersion she tarried not to
revive; but no sooner did the fury think herself
safe from my wrath, than, setting up a hellish laugh,
"Wipe clean your Euphrosyne," cried she, "ere
you bespatter others with the dirt which you have
gained!" and then walked off with threatening
gesture,&mdash;alternately wishing me joy of my prize,
and auguring me the reward of my guilt. Heated
as I was with passion, her curses made my blood
run cold, and in return I would have chilled for

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

ever the noisome tide in her own viper veins&mdash;but
with a home thrust of my dagger, had I not been
prevented that time, by the mob, from crushing the
reptile!</p>

<p>But its venomed bite left a print in my heart
which no power could efface! To fail in all my
schemes both of profit and of pride; to be burthened
with the whole weight of my mistress's existence,
while bereft of all esteem for her character;
to feel myself the victim of her deceit or the sport of
her caprice, when her real tenderness had already
been prostituted;&mdash;and more than that, to find the
shame which I had hoped to bury in the inmost
recesses of my own bosom, divulged to all the world;
to be pointed at with derision by those very companions
over whom I had made sure to triumph&mdash;were
tortures beyond my strength to bear; or at
least, to bear alone; and the embers of affection for
my new inmate, still glowing in my breast when I
last left my home, seemed all extinguished ere I again
crossed my threshold. If however I only returned
to my abode with the determination of making my
guest a partaker in all the sufferings drawn down by
her last insane act upon myself, it was also with the
full intent to keep the cause of my behaviour locked
for ever within my own swelling heart! Why indeed
dwell without necessity upon the painful thoughts
of an infamy, of which I was unable to bring the
proof, and despaired of extorting the confession!</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

<p>Under her former playfulness of manner Euphrosyne
had always concealed great decision of
character. She had shrunk from going home to a
husband or from staying with friends, whose reproach
she must fear, or whose forbearance endure.
Me alone she had considered as accountable for
whatever home and felicity my offence had deprived
her of elsewhere; and to me she had come for refuge,
as to the only person who still owed her protection:
but she had come oppressed with the sense of
her dishonour; she had come with such deep anguish
at the heart, that, had the fruitfulness of her
imagination still broke forth amid her glowing shame
into the smallest bud of sprightliness or fancy, she
would have thought it a duty to crush the tender
blossoms, as weeds whose rank luxuriance ill became
her fallen state. Nothing but the most unremitting
tenderness on my part could in some degree have
revived her drooping spirits.</p>

<p>But when, after my excursion and the act of
justice on Sophia in which it ended, I reappeared
before the still trembling Euphrosyne, she saw too
soon that that cordial of the heart must not be expected.
One look she cast upon my countenance,
as I sat down in silence, sufficed to inform her of my
total change of sentiments;&mdash;and the responsive look
by which it was met, tore for ever from her breast the
last seeds of hope and confidence. Like the wounded
snail she shrunk within herself, and thenceforth,

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

cloaked in unceasing sadness, never more expanded
to the sunshine of joy. With her buoyancy of spirits
she seemed even to lose all her quickness of intellect,
nay all her readiness of speech: so that, not
only fearing to embark with her in serious conversation,
but even finding no response in her mind to
lighter topics, I at last began to nauseate her seeming
torpor and dulness, and to roam abroad even
more frequently than before a partner of my fate
remained at home, to count the tedious hours of
my absence; while she&mdash;poor miserable creature&mdash;dreading
the sneers of an unfeeling world, passed
her time under my roof in dismal and heart-breaking
solitude.</p>

<p>Had the most patient endurance of the most intemperate
sallies been able to soothe my disappointment
and to soften my hardness, Euphrosyne's angelic
sweetness must at last have conquered: but
in my jaundiced eye her resignation only tended to
strengthen the conviction of her shame: and I saw
in her forbearance nothing but the consequence of
her debasement, and the consciousness of her guilt.
"Did her heart," thought I, "bear witness to a
purity on which my audacity dared first to cast a
blemish, she could not remain thus tame, thus spiritless,
under such an aggravation of my wrongs; and
either she would be the first to quit my merciless
roof, or at least she would not so fearfully avoid
giving me even the most unfounded pretence for

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

denying her its shelter.&mdash;She must merit her sufferings,
to bear them so meekly!"</p>

<p>Hence, even when moved to real pity by gentleness
so enduring, I seldom relented in my apparent
sternness. In order to conquer or at least to conceal
sentiments which I considered as effects only of
weakness, I even forced myself on these occasions
to increased severity. Unable to go the length of
parting from a friendless outcast, even though&mdash;conformable
to her own terms&mdash;the continuance of
my love was to have given the measure of her stay,
I almost banished myself entirely from my own
home, and plunged more headlong than ever into
extravagance and dissipation. Unto this period I
had quaffed my wine, to enjoy its flavour: I now
drank, to drive away my senses. Unto this period
I had gamed to beguile an idle hour: I now played
to produce in my spirits a brief intoxication. I
stayed out while I was able to renew my stake, and
only returned home when utterly exhausted by my
losses. Nay, when Euphrosyne, after sitting up
alone all night, saw me return&mdash;pale and feverish&mdash;
in the broad glare of the next morning, it was often
only to be pursued by all the spleen collected during
my nocturnal excesses. Yet she tarried on: for to
me she had sacrificed her all; and though in me
she found nothing but a thorn, yet to that thorn she
clung, as to that on which alone now hung her whole
existence!</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 75 -->

<p>Euphrosyne was wont to keep in readiness for
me a hot cup of coffee, when I came in from my
nightly revels. After gambling it served as a restorative;
but after drinking it was the only thing
capable of allaying the sort of temporary madness,
with which wine always affected my irritable brain.
One morning, when alternate losses at dice and libations
to Bacchus had sent me home half frantic,
instead of finding my mistress as usual all alacrity
to minister the reviving draft, to chafe my throbbing
temples, and to perform what other soothing
offices her awe of me permitted, I found her lying
on the floor in a swoon. I only thought her asleep;
but, on attempting to lift her up, her features were
bruised and her face besmeared with blood. Unnerved
by excess and shaking with agitation, my
arm however was wholly unable to support even
her light weight, and I let her drop again. She
thought I did so on purpose, for, raising her head
with great effort, she fixed on my countenance her
haggard tearless eyes, and, clasping her hands together,
for the first time vented her anguish in
audible words. "I had been warned," she cried,
with half stifled emotion.</p>

<p>"How?" said I.</p>

<p>"That morning," answered she, "when unexpectedly
you appeared among us in the meadow, you
were scarcely out of sight when the cause of your
coming was discussed. We agreed&mdash;foolish girls

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

as we were&mdash;that chance alone had not brought you
to that place, and drew lots to find out where lurked
the secret attraction. I got the prize, if prize it
could be called! A friend some years older than
myself observing my emotion, 'Euphrosyne,' she
whispered, 'if you care not for that stranger, frolic
with him as you like; but, if ever he should gain
your affections, O! avoid him like a pestilence.
From the moment that he knows himself the master
of your heart, he will treat it as wayward children do
their toys; he will not rest until he has broken it.'</p>

<p>"This was but the first warning, and only given
by a human voice," continued my mistress: "A
higher admonition came straight from heaven! You
know the marble image found in our field, which
now adorns our garden. Once, they say, it was
flesh and blood,&mdash;a hapless maiden like myself;
but alas, less susceptible, and therefore turned into
stone. On the night of your outrage, as I rose from
my prayer&mdash;from the prayer which at that time I
neither neglected, nor felt afraid to utter&mdash;a deep
hollow moan issued from its snowy bosom! Another
and a louder shriek was heard when I spoke to
Argyropoli; and one still more dismal than the
former rent the air, when I left my kinsman's roof
to fly to your arms!"</p>

<p>"And warned even by an insensible stone," I
cried, "you would not see the precipice?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Euphrosyne, "reproach me

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

with any thing but my love. It was that which, in
spite of every circumstance that should have opened
my eyes, still kept me blind."</p>

<p>"Your love," cried I, "neither merits my reproach,
nor yet calls for my praise. It depends not
on ourselves to withhold our affections, as it depends
not on us to renovate a worn-out passion."</p>

<p>"Is it then true," cried Euphrosyne, "that you
love me no more?"</p>

<p>"Has not that question been answered already?"
said I, peevishly: "but you will not understand,
unless all is spoken!"</p>

<p>At these words Euphrosyne put her hands to her
ears, as if fearing to hear her formal dismission;
and immediately ran to shut herself in her adjoining
chamber. I left the wayward girl to the solitude
she sought, and, unable to obtain any refreshment
at home, immediately went out again. Exhausted
with watching, sleep overcame me in the coffee-house
where I had sought my breakfast, and, as
soon as I felt somewhat recruited by its welcome
intrusion, a detachment of our party carried me
away by force, to make me woo afresh fickle fortune
at the gaming-table. Within the irresistible influence
of its magic circle I stayed, and played, and
drank, and slept&mdash;and played, and drank, and slept
again&mdash;till, reeling out in the dark to go home, I
fell from the steps, sprained my ankle, cut my face,
and lay for a time senseless on the pavement. Carried

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

in again as soon as discovered in this plight, it
became my fate to be tied by the leg in the very
gambling room, where the hazardous shake of the
elbow had already kept me spell-bound so long.</p>

<p>I was so far an economist of time, as always to
devote that of forced confinement to the irksome
business of reflection; and I had a great deal of that
sort of occupation accumulating on my hands, to
employ my present leisure. The unconcern of my
pretended friends on seeing me suffer, very soon
made me draw unfavourable comparisons of their
sentiments with those of Euphrosyne. Granting
that she had been too susceptible before she knew
me, how patient, how penitent, how devoted had
she shown herself ever since! Yet how cruel the
return I had made, and how deep the last wound I
had inflicted!</p>

<p>The thought grew so irksome, that, not daring to
send for my mistress among a set of scoffers, and yet
impatient to make her amends, I crept, as soon as
the dawn again arose, off my couch, stole away, and
limped home.</p>

<p>When I knocked at my door, no one answered
from within. Louder I therefore knocked and
louder; but with no better success. At last my
heart sunk within me, and my knees began to totter.
Euphrosyne never stirred out:&mdash;could she&mdash;&mdash;?
I dreaded to know the truth, and yet I was
near going mad with the delay. She might be ill,

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

and unable to come down, though not yet beyond
the reach of succour, or the comfort of kindness!
It was possible she heard me, and had not strength
to answer or to let me in. Timely assistance still
perhaps might save her: even tardy tenderness,
though shown too late to arrest her fleeting soul,
might still at least allay the bitterness of its departure.
A word, a look of sympathy might solace
her last moments, and waft her spirit on lighter wings
to heaven!</p>

<p>Frantic with impatience, I endeavoured to break
open the sullen door, but could only curse its perverse
steadiness in doing its duty. In despair at
the delay, I was going for an axe to hew it from its
hinges, when an old deaf neighbour, who began to
suspect she heard a noise, came down half dressed to
lend her assistance. She employed nearly as much
time before she let herself out, as I had lost in trying
to get in. At last, however, her feeble efforts were
crowned with success. Forth she came, and put on
her spectacles to scrutinise my person. A deliberate
survey having satisfied her respecting my identity,
she thrust her withered arm deep in her ample
pocket, and drew out fifty things which neither of
us wanted, before she ended by producing the key
of my lodging, which she put into my hands with a
low courtesy, as having been left in her care by the
lady who had taken her departure.</p>

<p>"Thank God!&mdash;I have not killed her!" was my

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

first exclamation. "That weight at least is off my
burthened mind!" and as soon as I had sufficiently
recovered my breath, I inquired of the old woman
the time and circumstances of Euphrosyne's disappearance:&mdash;what
conveyance had taken her away;
in what direction she went; and above all, what
message she had left?</p>

<p>These were useless queries, and the frequent repetition
of them for the purpose of being understood,
a fruitless expenditure of breath. It took
me half an hour to make my neighbour hear me:
and when I succeeded at last, so near was she to
dotage, that I could make nothing of her answers.
On my asking as the least perplexing question, how
long the key had been in the old goody's possession,
she could only say, "ever since it had been given
her."</p>

<p>Despairing of more explicit intelligence outside
my threshold, I went in, and in three strides reached
the top of the stairs, and my own empty room.
From that I ran into the next, equally empty and
desolate; looked upon every table and shelf, under
every seat and cushion, in every box and drawer,
and behind every chest and wardrobe. My hopes
were to find some letter, some note, some scrap of
paper, written, if not in kindness, at least in anger,
to inform me which way my poor girl had fled: but
I looked in vain; there was nothing!</p>

<p>I possessed no clue whatever to a probable solution

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

of my doubts; I could form no opinion on the
strange event; I sat down in mute amazement, trying
to think, and yet finding no point on which to
fix my thoughts. At last, as my eyes continued to
wander in total vacancy round the room, they fell
upon some writing which assuredly had not been
intended to court my sight; for it run along the
skirting of the wainscot, and could only have been
written by Euphrosyne, with her pencil, as she lay
on the ground. I stooped down to read, and only
found some broken sentences, probably traced by
my mistress when she left me the last time to seek
refuge in solitude. The sense seemed addressed to
herself more than to her destroyer, and the words
were mostly effaced:&mdash;thus ran the few legible lines.</p>

<p>"At last he has spoken plainly!&mdash;I shall go&mdash;no
matter where!&mdash;Let him rejoice. On boasting
of his triumphs over unsuspecting innocence, he
may now add&mdash;'I have ruined Euphrosyne!'&mdash;and
be proud to think a greater fall from purity to
corruption, from honour to infamy, and from happiness
to misery, was never achieved by human
hands!" Then followed a string of half obliterated
words, among which all I could make out was an
invocation to the Almighty, not to withhold from
me its blessings, nor to visit on Selim poor Euphrosyne's
wrongs! A thousand daggers seemed,
on reading this sentence, to pierce my heart at
once.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

<p>Every thing remained as I had left it, except
Euphrosyne alone! She had taken nothing with
her; for she had nothing to take:&mdash;the last articles
of her apparel, worth any money, had been sold to
supply her necessities, or rather my extravagance.</p>

<p>A film now all at once dropped from before my
eyes, and my former behaviour presented itself to
me in a totally new light. Though I might still
believe,&mdash;and indeed now most anxiously wished
to believe, for the relief of my goaded conscience,&mdash;that
Euphrosyne had not at all times been equally
watchful of that perfect purity she boasted; that in
some unguarded moment the inexperience of early
youth had suffered her virtue to contract a slight
speck; that the tale so boldly told by her waiting-woman
was not wholly without foundation: yet,
on contemplating her conduct on that eventful day
when she might for ever have wrapped every former
stain in the ample impenetrability of the nuptial
veil, but, with a magnanimous disdain of all meanness
or subterfuge, resigned herself to poverty, persecution,
and disgrace, for the sake of rigid righteousness,
I could not doubt that already at that period
at least the mental corruption, the taint of the
soul (if ever it had existed), had been in the eye
of Supreme mercy washed away by repentance, and
had left the whole crime of plunging a noble creature
into inextricable ruin chargeable to my account
alone!</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 83 -->

<p>And supposing that even the tale of Euphrosyne's
early frailty itself,&mdash;that only sheet anchor of
my conscience amid a sea of distracting doubts&mdash;should
after all turn out a mere fabrication, as
seemed from Sophia's unprincipled conduct a thing
not impossible: supposing the whole first chapter of
Euphrosyne's short history should have been nothing
but a scene of artless innocence; nay, supposing
that the thoughtless girl should really have
been ignorant even of the assignation whence arose
all her sorrows; supposing that when she first came
in agony to my abode, only to avoid a public expulsion
from her own, she should have had nothing
with which to reproach her own heart, but some
latent sparks of love for her despoiler; supposing I
thus had only plunged into everlasting perdition a
being, throughout the whole of her once happy
career as unexceptionable in conduct as she had
been enviable in circumstances; and that, for no
purpose but to end her race of undeserved sufferings
by turning her out of doors, and forcing her
upon the wide world without a friend, a relation, or
a home,&mdash;and at a time too when her situation demanded
more than ordinary tenderness!&mdash;&mdash;The
thought was too dreadful even for me to bear: it
racked me to the soul; and what rendered my remorse
doubly pungent, love itself, that love which
I had thought long annihilated, seemed to re-enter
at the rents torn in my heart by pity. A thousand

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

excellencies in my mistress, before unheeded, now
flashed upon my mind. From the embers of a more
sensual flame, extinguished almost as soon as raised,
now burst forth a brighter intellectual blaze never
before experienced; as from a body in dissolution
arise flames of pure ethereal fire.</p>

<p>Sorrow, self-reproach, and uncertainty seemed for
a while to deprive me of all power of exertion; but
the moment a ray of hope roused me from motionless
dismay into fresh activity, I ran frantic all over
Smyrna in search of my lost mistress. I abruptly
stopped in the street every person, high or low,
male or female, whom I thought likely to have
witnessed her escape; I forcibly invaded every
house in which I fancied she might be concealed.
No place capable of harbouring any thing in the
human shape, and which I dared investigate, did I
leave unexplored. Of the individuals assailed by
my inquiries some laughed, some took offence, some
reproached me for my inconsistency, and some supposed
me to be a maniac broke loose from his
confinement. I minded not their surprise or their
scoffing, but continued my pursuit while I had
strength. Alas! I continued it in vain. No Euphrosyne
could I find!</p>

<p>Reluctantly I now again turned me to the abhorred
Sophia, to assist me in my labour. The
wretch had not only deceived me, betrayed my
Euphrosyne, and, by divulging all she ought to

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

have concealed, involved the one in ruin and the
other in disgrace; she had even, as if on purpose
daily to enjoy the shame cast on Chrysopulo's house,
hired a lodging directly opposite his gate: but vast
failings are overlooked in those whose aid we want.
I hied me to the ex-suivante full of conciliatory
speeches: she met them with assurances of equal
contrition, and expressed so much regret for her
indiscretion, so much compassion for Euphrosyne,
and so much sympathy with me, that, in view of the
readiness she showed to second my search, all was
or appeared to be forgiven. We shook hands; I
made fresh promises, and Sophia entered upon fresh
services.</p>

<p>My resolution this time was formed, and will be
allowed to have been unexceptionable. The instant
fortune crowned our united labours, Euphrosyne
was to receive the meed of her long and patient
sufferings, or at least, the offer of every reparation
which I could make for my manifold offences. Not
only I meant immediately to proclaim her my
honoured, my wedded, my inseparable wife; but,
what to some might seem more difficult or more
problematical, I intended to become myself the best
and most faithful of husbands.</p>

<p>Fate allowed me full time to study the requisites
of that new character. Our twofold search did not
turn out more successful than had done before my
single-handed endeavours:&mdash;by no means, however.

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

for want of activity in Sophia. Like Satan her
master, she seemed endowed with the gift of ubiquity.
Not a day passed that she did not come to
me with a long account of the places she had visited,
and of those she meant to visit; of the hopes she
had been disappointed of in one quarter, and of the
expectations she entertained in another; of her
glimpses here, and of her surmises there. So often
did she drag me after her through every street and
lane of Smyrna, that my friends pretended to think
that she had herself stepped into Euphrosyne's
place, and, when the city had been ransacked
through to the last garret and cellar, we extended
our search to every village and hamlet, within ten
or fifteen miles round.</p>

<p>When at last I had explored every district within
the Mootsellimlik of Ismir, until I no longer could
think of any place unsearched, and found nothing
left to do but to sit down in contented ignorance,
or rather in calm despair, there flew in at my open
window, one evening, a small silken bag, flung by
an invisible hand and conveying a gold ring. It
was one which I had put on Euphrosyne's finger,
immediately after the memorable farewell visit of
her kind-hearted friends, and ere I called upon my
companions to claim my bets. On the slip of paper
twisted round the ring appeared the following
words. "Cease a pursuit, as vain as it is thankless;
nor seek any longer to disturb the peace of Euphrosyne,

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

now cured of a worthless passion; now at
rest from her grief in more merciful hands. The
ring you once gave her in proof of your love, reverts
to you in sign that she never more can accept
your tardy, your unavailing tenderness."</p>

<p>These words, evidently written by the same hand
which had originally pointed Euphrosyne out to me
as a desirable conquest, seemed at last fully to explain
her motives for leaving me, or at least her
conduct since her disappearance. Nothing could
be clearer, in my opinion, than that the artful
schemer who had first instigated me to seduce the
lovely girl, had availed himself of my forced absence
from home, to take her off my hands. I had been
a mere tool to some more designing member of our
nefarious brotherhood.</p>

<p>It might, however, in one sense, be called considerate
thus at last to relieve me from all further
anxiety and trouble; and nothing but the inherent
perverseness of human nature could have changed,
as it did, the cold indifference with which I had
treated my mistress while she depended wholly upon
my affection, into the warmth which her image rekindled
in my heart, the moment I supposed her
comforted by another: but this new ardour, conceived
too late, I kept to myself; and judging that other
individual now preferred to be&mdash;though unknown&mdash;frequently
in my company, I took uncommon
pains to evince by my mirth my gratitude for his

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

proceedings. Lest he should have any doubt on
this subject, not a day passed without my joining
some festive party in excursions to Boornabad, to
Sedi-keui, and other places; and by these means I
recovered at last in reality the lightness of heart
which I affected; and that to such a degree as
almost to grow frightened at my own unusual hilarity,
and to apprehend it might forebode some new impending
sorrow.</p>

<p>An excursion had often been projected, and as
often put off, to a village a few miles from Smyrna,
celebrated for the beauty of its situation. At last
the party took place. We were sitting, half a dozen
thoughtless souls, under the cool shade of a locust
tree. I had taken up a lyre, laid down by one of
my companions, and was just going to try my long
neglected skill in a Greek ballad which I used to
sing to Helena, when a peasant brought me a note
of a suspicious appearance.</p>

<p>Determined this time to know the author of this
single-handed correspondence, I began by laying
hold of its conveyer. The messenger seemed the
quintessence of stupidity: my catechising could
draw nothing from him, except that the billet had
been committed to his care three miles off by a
female hidden in her veil, come from a distance,
and who immediately again took herself off. All
that the bearer could or would say ending there, I
turned me to the epistle.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

<p>It ran thus:</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a Greek merchant whose
name was Sozimato? Once he excelled Chrysopulo
himself in riches, in ambition, and in sway; but
fortune turned fickle. Chrysopulo saw new thousands
press upon his former thousands, and Sozimato
ended a bankrupt. The match contracted
between Chrysopulo's son and Sozimato's daughter
now of course was cancelled; for between the rich
and the poor no engagement could subsist. To
sharpen the sting of the insult, the humble daughter
of the bankrupt was offered a servant's place in
Chrysopulo's family: for the upstarts exulted in
treading on the neck of the fallen! The offer of
arrogance was however accepted, and the taunts of
insolence were borne without a complaint. A disease
for which there was no cure carried off Chrysopulo's
infant son; and Euphrosyne,&mdash;a distant
relation&mdash;became the adopted daughter. She too
was rendered the victim of just revenge. A set of
lawless young men had established a society for the
purpose of ruining the peace of sober families. One
member of this noble fraternity was spoken of in
the town as more bold and unprincipled than the
rest: he was singled out to cast dishonour on
Chrysopulo's house, and to sow misery among its
members; and at last, through his instrumentality,&mdash;for
he was but a tool&mdash;that Euphrosyne, most
unjustly aspersed in her unsullied virtue, became

<!-- vol 3 page 90 -->

the kept mistress of a needy adventurer. Foul disgrace,
conjured up from all quarters, thus cast its
cloud over Chrysopulo's name.</p>

<p>"Here the work of vengeance might have ended,
had not the adventurer too dared to treat with indignity
the daughter of Sozimato. It was for this
she joined in the search after his departed mistress;
it was for this she permitted not the unfortunate
girl to be found: it was for this she prevented her
from being solaced by her lover's returning tenderness,
even when she lay totally destitute in a miserable
garret, at the last period of her long protracted
labour; and it was for this, finally, that she prepared
the infidel wretch a world of endless pangs,
by plying his hapless mistress with false accounts of
his unrelenting barbarity, unto the last day of her
hapless existence!</p>

<p>"Great, no doubt, were the difficulties in preventing
a meeting between the repentant sinner and
his innocent victim. One day he penetrated into
the very abode where she lay writhing under every
agony of body and of mind. A ragged curtain
alone kept her from his sight, and a single cry unstifled
must have thrown him in her arms! Watchfulness,
however, triumphed: the adventurer turned
back in ignorance; and his Euphrosyne saw him
no more. She was delivered, unaided by any one
but the person who had served, had sold her, and
now was labouring that she might be sainted. Yet

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

did the angel on earth try to do what she could for
her adored Selim's child. Seeing it ready to perish
for want of sustenance, she resolved to save her
infant's life by completing her own shame. Ere
however the sacrifice could be accomplished, she
expired,&mdash;expired among strangers, pronouncing
Selim's name! The more merciful hands in which
this miserable man read that his mistress was at rest,
were those of her Maker: the ring he received had
been taken from her corpse already cold; and the
sole worker of all this woe, I scarcely need add, was
the injured and now satisfied Sophia."</p>

<p>I do not know how I was able to finish the
perusal of this letter, except from a sort of stupor
which for a moment kept all my faculties, save that
of mere perception, suspended. The first word
however which one of our party uttered, broke the
fascination, set loose my entranced senses, and with
them all the demons of hell which had been gathering
all the while in my bosom. What species of
violence I committed in breaking away from the
convivial scene to pursue the detestable Sophia, is
wholly beyond my knowledge. I neither saw, nor
heard, nor thought, until I reached Smyrna.</p>

<p>Sophia knew me too well to wait my return. Ere
I received her note she had left that place for ever:
nor could I trace her flight. It was only some time
after, when, hopeless of discovering her abode, I
had committed to Heaven the care of her punishment,

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

that in the least likely of places I met the
embodied fury. She again tried to avoid me&mdash;again
commenced the race of conscious guilt; but
this time to no purpose. Her crime was one of
those, which, more atrocious than many which justice
never spares, yet mock its shackled arm. I
therefore took into my own hands a punishment
too long delayed: nor was it the more lenient from
that circumstance.</p>

<p>This unlooked-for event seemed to afford me
some refreshment. For a while I felt the thirst of
my soul assuaged, the raging fever of my blood
somewhat allayed: but the cessation of pain was
only transient. The image of Euphrosyne expiring
on a bed of wretchedness, and in the belief that I
was hailing the hour of her departure at the very
time when I would have given my own life to have
found the poor sufferer&mdash;when I only prayed to
Heaven for leave to take her back, to cherish her in
my now softened bosom, and to make her taste at
last, ere yet too late, of happiness&mdash;soon began to
haunt me incessantly; and too truly I found that
the fury Sophia had insinuated into my heart a
canker, which I was destined to carry to the grave!</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> painful chapter is concluded;&mdash;that chapter
of my history to which I looked forward with dismay,
and which I hurried over with shame and
sorrow. Frequently, during the dreary course of
the last pages, has my hand felt as if arrested, and
my pen ready to drop from my fingers: but I
wished to offer in the faithful narrative of my injustice,
the only sacrifice in my power to the memory
of my Euphrosyne; and, having performed
this severe but wholesome penance, I seem to breathe
somewhat more freely, and to proceed on the sequel
of my narrative with less reluctance. Too forcibly
however do I feel that the film which obscured my
judgment during the sad events of which I have
made a full confession, will be admitted with the
unimpassioned reader as a feeble palliation only of
my offences, and that even my bitter repentance
itself will scarcely have the power of averting so
deep an abhorrence of my fault, as must cast a
blasting influence over the whole sequel of my tale.</p>

<p>After learning the fate of my unfortunate mistress,
there still remained one other task of fearful
anxiety to be performed; namely, to ascertain that

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

of my not less pitiable child. I knew not whether
the babe had followed its mother to the grave, or
was still alive to share its father's misery: but no
Sophia any longer intervening between me and the
object of my search, it was soon successful. I discovered
the poor people under whose humble roof
my Euphrosyne had breathed her last; I found in
their arms a lovely infant depending on charity for
its support, and learnt that the smiling babe was
my own. External proof was not requisite to confirm
the assertions of its fosterfather: too brightly
shone in the cherub's eye the heaven of its mother's
looks,&mdash;that heaven in which, but for my own waywardness,
I might have lived for ever blessed! Alexis
had her radiant brow, her pouting lip, her dimpled
chin. The very rag which enveloped the poor infant
was a relic of Euphrosyne's last earthly vestment;
once, in her days of splendour, a rich tissue
of purple and gold,&mdash;now so tarnished, so stripped
of its original lustre, that it seemed to have continued
to the last the faithful emblem of her whose
graceful limbs it had encircled until they waxed
cold in death.</p>

<p>I pressed my child to my bosom, to my lips, to
my eyes. Hurt by the roughness of my face, perhaps
annoyed by the copious flowing of my tears,
the poor babe began to cry. So full of terror were
its looks, one might have fancied it had recognised
its till now unfeeling father: I therefore reluctantly

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

laid it down again, and discontinued my unwelcome
endearments: but fearful lest gratuitous care might
have less merit in the execution than in the design,
I told the poor people I should rid them of the
burthen, and take my child away. They turned
pale at the intelligence, and though rewarded to
the full extent of my scanty means, wept on resigning
my Alexis into other hands. What little sum
I was able to raise by the sale of my remaining
trinkets, I deposited for his maintenance with the
most trustworthy people whom my search could
discover; and then began to consider how I should
live myself. The Turkish law, it is true, grants
not the vindictive pleasure of shutting up for life a
disabled debtor, nor punishes the man who has
got into debt, by preventing him from ever getting
out of his creditor's books again; but still in Turkey,
as elsewhere, one may starve even out of gaol.</p>

<p>There were some who would have had me inform
my friend Spiridion of my distress: but I
could not bear to ask a favour from one to whom I
could make no return. "Far better were it,"
thought I, "to be indebted for my subsistence to
my own bravery, than to the reluctant compassion
of others. Weary of life, and anxious only to
banish reflection, I meditated joining some of those
bold members of society who, having occupied an
abandoned district, imitate the sovereigns of the
globe, and tax the traveller for trespassing on their

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

domain. Theirs was the employment&mdash;doubtless
noble in itself&mdash;of transferring to the needy the
superfluities of the affluent; and who could plead
more pinching wants than a father burthened with
the necessities of a motherless babe, and forced to
fight for subsistence or to see his infant starve? Nor
did in Turkey the profession of a bandit lack its
respectability. A high-minded man might embrace
the career of the ha&iuml;doot without blushing: while
most busily employed in reaping its benefits, he
still recognised certain principles of honour; and
when tired of its perils, he found no obstacle&mdash;if
fortunate enough never to have been caught in the
fact&mdash;to laying down his dangerous trade unmolested,
boasting of his past exploits, and seeking
some safer and less precarious employment, on
a par with such among his fellow-citizens as had,
in the capacity of magistrates or rulers, pursued
the same profession more unostentatiously. Sick
at heart and ruined in purse, I saw in a robber's
life the only remedy for both diseases. Besides,
the scheme, if well managed, might be rendered
preparatory to another which I had secretly
cherished ever since the commencement of my
embarrassments. At Bagdad was seated on the
throne of the ancient Kaliphs a Pasha more resembling
an independent sovereign than a Sultan's
representative. Himself the disposer of sundry
lesser pashaliks, his wide domain and constant

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

warfare with his manifold neighbours offered to the
soldier of fortune a fertile field for promotion. I
wished to try his service. Some of the principal
troops of banditti that grace the Turkish empire
lined the various roads to his capital; and I might,
in my way to that new theatre of my ambition,
either occasionally join their numerous marauding
parties, or, sportsman-like, take my gun, and singly
arrest the flight of some passing traveller, to solace
the tediousness or supply the necessities of my
journey.</p>

<p>Nobler game, however, was for a moment near
attracting me to more distant realms, where rulers
themselves were despoiled, and kings hunted down.
An Italian had dropped as if from the clouds at
Smyrna, who in appearance only wooed the Muses,
but in reality belonged to the sect of political propagandists,
about that time disseminated all the
world over, to preach emancipation from every
bondage, natural, civil, and religious. The disturbance
of my mind, and the distress of my situation,
could not remain long concealed from the keen-eyed
improvvisatore, and he resolved to make them
subservient to his secret purposes.</p>

<p>"Listen," he would say in a prophetic tone&mdash;whenever
he found or could make room for a set
speech: "The time is at hand when all the tottering
monuments of ignorance, credulity, and superstition,
no longer protected by the foolish awe which

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

they formerly inspired, shall strew the earth with
their wrecks! Every where the young shoots of
reason and liberty, starting from between the rents
and crevices of the worn-out fabrics of feudalism,
are becoming too vigorous any longer to be checked:
they soon will burst asunder the baseless edifices of
self-interest and prejudice, which have so long impeded
their growth. Religious inquisition, judicial
torture, monastic seclusion, tyranny, oppression,
fanaticism, and all the other relics of barbarism, are
to be driven from the globe. Annihilation awaits
the whole code of hereditary rights, exclusive privileges,
and mortifying distinctions, only derived
by men born equal, from mouldering ancestors and
musty parchments. Soon shall armorial bearings,
empty titles, and frivolous orders, cease to insult
man's understanding. Whatever appeared great
only through the mist of error; whatever was magnified
into importance only through the medium of
prejudice, shall have its deceitful size detected by
the torch of reason, and shall then be hurled back
into its pristine insignificance. Sceptred imbecility,
nodding on its crazy thrones, shall ere long be laid
prostrate in the dust; and subjects, making sovereigns
their footstools, shall assert man's primeval
equality, by mounting upon their tyrants' necks into
their tyrants' places. Already in more than one
realm does the hallowed work of regeneration advance
with rapid strides: already throughout Gallia

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

streams day and night the blood of victims: already
dungeons forced open, castles levelled with the
ground, and feudal records committed to the flames,
mark the approach of a happier era; while one
monarch shot in the midst of his court, and another
dragged to the scaffold by his own subjects, are but
the first fruits offered up at the new-raised shrine
of liberty, whose temple must some day encompass
the whole universe. You then who here pine in an
inglorious sloth, awake from your long slumber,
emancipate your oppressed spirits, and join the
noble cause. Enlist among the uprising liberators
of mankind. Leave this worn-out empire of despotism
and slavery, this den of tigers doomed to
speedy destruction; and seek on the yellow banks
of the Seine the blessed dawn of a fast spreading
revolution. Hasten to that busy capital of all nations,
where from all quarters of the globe flock the
lovers of liberty and the haters of kings, and meet
with welcome and with denizenship all who, mastered
by their liberal feelings, yearn to establish sword in
hand universal philanthropy. Your part on this
grand theatre already is marked out for you. All
that you have to do is to present yourself in the
august assembly of the great nation, as the representative
of oppressed and mourning Greece. Be
the eloquent, the pathetic organ of its ardent wish
to share in the benefits which France confers on the
world. Tell of the myriads that in the land of the

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

Cimons and the Miltiadeses lift up to her their imploring
hands. Your person is showy, your lungs
are potent, your speech untrammelled by troublesome
timidity, and, with a dress designed by the
painter David (I would advise a Grecian tunic)
and a few attitudes of uncontrollable emotion imitated
from the sublime Talma, it will be your own
fault if, in the convention, you are not hailed as the
worthy descendant of Harmodius and Aristogiton!"</p>

<p>This rhapsody made me laugh; but I thought
the subject serious. In the midst of all my grief,
it interested my vanity, and I inquired the shortest
way to Paris. We agreed that as soon as arrived
on European ground, Cirico (the poet) should in
view of his superior local knowledge act as my <i>avant
courier</i>. Unfortunately his impatience marred the
project. Desirous of giving a specimen of his
talent, he improvised himself away from Smyrna
ere I had the least intimation of his departure. In
his hurry he left his bill unpaid, and took away his
landlord's silver spoons. This inadvertency cast a
shade upon his doctrine. I bade mourning Greece
wipe away her tears without me, and, instead of
journeying in behalf of universal liberty to Paris,
resumed the plan of my predatory expedition to
Bagdad.</p>

<p>In conformity to the nature of my views, I set
out lightly provisioned but heavily armed, and the
first stage of my journey witnessed the first trial of

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

my skill. At a hamlet where travellers sometimes
stop to refresh, a caravan of Franks was waiting for
the cool of the evening to proceed in greater comfort.
Only come from Sedi-keui, and only intending
to visit Ephesus&mdash;or rather the spot once
adorned by that city&mdash;these dilettanti in ruins had
provided no guard. I proposed to two or three
loiterers whom I picked up by the way, to teach
them more prudence. Neither I nor they, we
agreed, would commit a serious robbery: but it
was only a frolic; and we swore to each other faithfully
to restore what we took, unless we thought it
very particularly worth keeping.</p>

<p>A little circuit and a quicker pace brought us
first to a defile, which very soon after and just at
dusk our travellers also entered. Their attendants
were suffered to pass on; but we could not help
interrupting a very earnest discussion in which the
more tardy masters were engaged:&mdash;it was only for
the purpose of demanding their money. This request
they readily enough complied with; and I
could not have found the smallest pretence for complaining
of their backwardness, even if the elder of
the two had forborne from bestowing with his well
filled purse the benefit of a lecture.</p>

<p>But for this latter circumstance the somewhat
singular travelling garb of the worthy gentleman
who took this opportunity of improving my morality
would eternally have kept concealed from my

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

knowledge, that I had the honour of stripping the
Baron H&mdash;&mdash;, Swedish consul-general at Smyrna,
and my own much respected acquaintance. Residing
in the summer season at Sedi-keui, he had
insisted on accompanying his young friend&mdash;an
eastern tourist&mdash;on this antiquarian excursion; and
I was the first object, not quite two thousand years
old, which had probably engaged their attention.
It was impossible to keep the money of a man
whose good fare I had more than once enjoyed;
wherefore, falling at the consul's feet: "Take back
your purse!" cried I; "it would bring me ill
fortune; and I have had enough already!"</p>

<p>At these words H&mdash;&mdash; stared on me in mute
astonishment, until, convinced that his senses did
not deceive him, he at last exclaimed with a loud
groan, "Selim Aga, for heaven's sake is it you?"</p>

<p>"It is," answered I.</p>

<p>"And what," resumed the consul, "can have
brought you to this?"</p>

<p>I blushed; and seeing my companions had
chosen to decamp during the parley, "We are
alone," said I; "let me go on with you to your
next halting-place, and there you shall hear all."</p>

<p>The proposal was accepted, and the distance
compassed in five or six hours&mdash;for my travellers
kept not in other matters pace with their tongues.
By a little brook, under the already acceptable shade
of an old plane-tree, we sat down an hour after

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

sunrise, and I told a not very exhilarating story.
At its conclusion I again intreated the consul to
take back his purse; but to this request he turned
a deaf ear. He had not much liked, he owned, to
have his viaticum forcibly taken from him; but he
now earnestly begged I might think it worthy my
acceptance.</p>

<p>"To what purpose?" exclaimed I.&mdash;"My object
was to try my hand at a highway robbery, more for
the sake of the act than the plunder. The things
which money may purchase I can no longer prize.
Life to me has lost its sweets!"</p>

<p>"Subdue your passions, young man," answered
H&mdash;&mdash;, "it is to them you owe all your misery."</p>

<p>"Alas!" was my reply, "what am I to believe?
Do not philosophers maintain that the passions are
the only road to knowledge, to power, and to virtue?
that the inert being who never has felt their influence
on his own mind knows not how to guide the
will of others, sees man as a machine whose movements
baffle his skill, constantly miscalculates the
views and conduct of his fellow creatures, and, only
attempting to move men like blocks by physical
force, must find a resistance which mocks his inadequate
impulse. Without the passion of love
would women encounter the pangs which preserve
our species? without that for ruling would man
endure the toil of maintaining public order amongst
it? Is not the passion of avarice that which brings

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

in contact, for universal benefit, the industry and the
produce of the most distant countries? and what
but the passion for fame makes man risk health,
fortune, nay life itself, for the advantages, perhaps
the amusement, of generations yet unborn? Like the
heat of the sun, that of the passions may strengthen
a few poisons, but alone it brings forth all the
sweets and healthful plants of the creation."</p>

<p>H&mdash;&mdash; shook his head. "It is feeling," said he,
"which, like the sun's genial warmth, ripens each
fairest fruit. Passions like a scorching blaze only
burn them to ashes. Would you behold the effects
of the former; look at my young friend here. Calm,
healthful, and blooming, he is the bee that sucks the
flowers of every clime, some day to bestow their
honey upon his grateful countrymen. Would you
know the consequence of the latter; look in the
brook beside you."</p>

<p>I advanced my head over the glassy pool: but
from its deep bosom up rose to meet my eye a
countenance ghastly&mdash;a cheek so wan and feverish&mdash;that
I started back with horror, I felt the reproof,
bowed assent, and said no more.</p>

<p>To his purse, which H&mdash;&mdash; positively refused to
take back, but allowed me if I liked to keep only
as a loan, his companion, rich as well as romantic,
now insisted on adding his mite. He tore a leaf
out of his pocket-book, and with the pen and ink
which he carried in a case about him, wrote a draft

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

on a banker at Haleb, to whom he was already
known. This order he made me solemnly promise
to present.</p>

<p>Greatly could I have wished to devote to the
new friends thus strangely gained the time destined
by them to the survey of Ephesus: but I feared lest
my presence might be a restraint upon the freedom
of their rambles, and, when Ayasolook rose in sight
with its towering citadel, I blessed them, kissed the
hand of the elder, embraced the younger, and went
my lonely way.</p>

<p>As nothing happened in the sequel of my journey
to answer the promises of the beginning,&mdash;as I
stopped no more travellers on the road, and received
no more purses for so doing, I shall be brief in the
account of its adventures. Alternately pushing on
by land or by sea, according as opportunities offered,
I found the one irksome and the other tedious. A
Turkish vessel conveyed me to Scanderoon. The
cabin had been hired for a wealthy merchant's harem.
Nothing so little seen, except thunder, ever made so
much noise. On the least motion of the ship, all the
women used to abuse the captain. The only instrument
capable of restoring them to order was the
husband's pipe stick: indeed it was much oftener
applied to his wives' backs than to his own lips;
and the whole of this good gentleman's active life
seemed to be divided between a puff and a blow.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

<p>The very day I landed at Scanderoon I proceeded
on to Ba&iuml;lan, there to wait in a purer air a caravan
of Armenians actually on their way. On the arrival
of the good folks I thought I beheld, instead of the
most pacific people on earth, a troop of Tartars only
breathing war and bloodshed. Each man looked
like a walking armoury, hung all round with every
species of offensive weapon. In confidence, however,
the leader of the troop desired me not to be alarmed:
"they made it a rule," they said, "never to use the
arms they carried."</p>

<p>Of this circumstance a detachment of Coordish
horsemen<sup id="r276"><a href="#n276">276</a></sup>, which we met a few leagues from our
starting-place, seemed perfectly aware. Though
not quite half our number, they no sooner saw us
approach than they drew their sabres, flung a
sheep's skin across the path, and civilly desired each
of us to drop into it, as we passed, the moderate sum
of five piastres. I took the liberty of expostulating:
but my friends were so averse to acts of violence,
and so anxious wherewithal for the honour of paying
my share of the contribution, that I could not,
either in conscience or good breeding, deny them
that pleasure. Notwithstanding that these little rencontres
might lead to a contrary conclusion, there
are guards stationed in the narrow passages of the
mountains, to protect the travellers and to awe the
banditti; but they constantly make mistakes, and

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

inform the Coords of the approaching traveller,
instead of warning the traveller of the neighbouring
Coords.</p>

<p>The fourth and last night of our journey we
stopped at Martahwan; a village of Ansariehs<sup id="r277"><a href="#n277">277</a></sup> of
pleasurable notoriety among the Halebines. The
owner of the hovel marked out for my lodging,
however, seemed ill provided; but the piteous manner
in which he apologised for the poorness of the
entertainment, by informing me that his wife was
dead, his daughter at the breast, and his mother
in her dotage, made me hasten to relieve his mind,
by stating that a mouthful of rice and a corner
to lie down in were all the comforts to which
I aspired. As to the conductor of our caravan,
whose whole life was spent in travelling backward
and forward between Haleb and Scanderoon, he
had wisely contrived that his conveniences should
not depend, like those of his ever changing charge,
on the chances of the road. Taking advantage
of the utmost latitude of the Mohammedan law,
he had not only provided himself with four wives,
but had distributed these between the four stations
of the journey so judiciously, that, though every
night on the road, he every night slept at home.</p>

<p>At Haleb I failed not to go&mdash;lest I might seem
forgetful of the kindness shown me near Ayasolook&mdash;to
the suburb of Djeda&iuml;d&eacute;, and there to present

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

the draft, given me by the young traveller for
my trouble in waylaying him. It was addressed to
an old Proven&ccedil;al merchant: a sort of humourist,
who always appeared in a rage, never agreed with
any body, contradicted himself when he found no
one else to contradict, and, if a stranger to his
whims incautiously fell into his opinion, took it as
an affront, and demanded explanation. On my
handing him the check, he alternately looked at the
bill and at me, and seemed to wonder how the two
came together. I tried to explain this to his satisfaction
by launching out into the praises of the
young traveller, and calling him quite the child of
nature; but here I found I had got on the wrong
scent. "Child of nature!" cried the Provencal,
"no more than you, or I, or pickled olives. If he
were, I should expect to be devoured by him. The
human beings that are nearest to nature eat their
enemies, make love to their mistresses by felling
them to the ground with a club, beat out their
wives' brains when they get tired of their persons,
and inter with the dead mothers their living babes.
Except such monsters as these, all our fellow
creatures are in different degrees the children of
art; the Indian and the Arab, as well as the European
and the Chinese: for with reason begins
art; and the first man who made use of the reasoning
faculty&mdash;if it were only to scoop out a drinking

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

bowl, or to point a spear&mdash;for ever took leave of
simple nature; and did very wisely!"</p>

<p>After this <i>tirade</i>, the worthy gentleman, inviting
me to be seated, informed me that finding little of
the resource of conversation at Aleppo, where the
natives were&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;<i>naturellement
b&ecirc;tes</i>, and his own countrymen <i>passablement animaux</i>,
he had addicted himself to philosophy <i>&agrave;
corps perdu:</i>&mdash;an expression perhaps not wholly
applicable, as I found him, on the contrary, to
be of the sect who never lose sight of the body for
a single instant, seek nothing but the useful, and
only estimate things according as they can be
eaten or drank. "In fact, fragrant odours, delicious
music, beautiful gardens, and such like," my
friend observed, "lose all their merit the moment
one becomes deaf, or blind, or afflicted with a cold
in the head!" He therefore&mdash;reserving all his
esteem for <i>le solide</i>,&mdash;held them in great contempt,
as totally unphilosophical; and, whenever they were
praised in his hearing, used, shrewdly to ask: "<i>&agrave;
quoi hon tout cela?</i>"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dinner being announced, he jumped
up, and cried out with exceeding glee: "<i>allons-y,
car il est tr&egrave;s philosophique de manger;</i>" a truth to
which I so fully assented that I was invited to take
my share, and for once had an opportunity of beholding
a sage truly intent upon putting his doctrine
in practice. Indeed he did this to such a

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

degree as almost to overshoot the mark, and to exceed
the limits of utility: for, though at every one
of the good dishes which a well trained attendant
successively enumerated in a loud voice, he emphatically
exclaimed; "<i>Eh mon Dieu, qu'est-ce que cela
me fait?</i>" yet being wholly absorbed in the eloquent
invective inspired by this variety of dainties against
the pernicious art of cookery, he went on practically
evincing its dangers, until I feared his philosophy
might end fatally, and was going to impart my
apprehension to his servant,&mdash;when luckily the
same idea struck this faithful domestic. He whispered
something in his master's ear: who thereupon
reddened, and turning round to me, said, "<i>Je fais
si peu attention &agrave; ce que je mange, que je suis sujet &agrave;
m'oublier, et &agrave; ne pas discontinuer jusqu'&agrave; ce qu' on
m'avertisse:</i>" in order to ensure the performance of
which necessary office, the prudent Proven&ccedil;al had
with infinite forecast granted his trusty attendant a
considerable annuity;&mdash;but upon his own more philosophic
life.</p>

<p>Dinner, dessert, coffee, and liqueurs being over, I
thanked my host for his entertainment, and took my
leave. "Ah!" exclaimed he, "why must I remain
here to look after pistachios and tobacco, while you
are going to behold the august site of ancient Babylon;
that cradle of wisdom, that fountain head of
gnosticism, which let man into all the secrets of the
Divine emanation, and into all the mysteries of the

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

universal soul! No doubt you will tread with veneration
its hallowed soil, kiss with rapture its
sacred dust, and make an ample store of its inestimable
bricks. But, no&mdash;you only go to seek the
filthy gold of a Pasha!" I laughed; owned I saw
more of the <i>utile</i> in a few sequins than in a whole
cart-load of worn out brick-bats, with inscriptions
which no living soul could understand, even though
they should have belonged to the tower of Babel;
begged the merchant's commands for that august
place, and took my departure.</p>

<p>To an unphilosophical traveller Aleppo was not
a disagreeable abode, though it had its inconveniences.
The stranger risked being torn to pieces
by the shereefs if he liked the jenissaries best,
stoned by the jenissaries if he preferred the shereefs,
and knocked down by both if he liked neither
pre-eminently. Every day the city was disturbed
by the feuds between these rival bodies. I left them
to settle their differences without my assistance,
and made my bargain with the kerwan-bashi of
a small kaffl&eacute;<sup id="r278"><a href="#n278">278</a></sup> on the eve of its departure, for
my conveyance to Bagdad. The conductor of the
caravan was to defray all expenses&mdash;tolls to Turks,
Arabs and Turkmen included, and to go, not by
the great desert, where we expected nothing but
pilfering Bedoweens, pestilential winds, and clouds of
parching dust, but by the longer and more agreeable
circuit of Moossool, described as an uninterrupted

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

succession of populous villages and cultivated
tracts.</p>

<p>On the appointed day we set out. Among the
party was an inquisitive prying marmoset, who could
not rest until he had sifted out the business and profession
of every member of the caravan. When it
came to my turn to be cross-questioned, I honestly
told him&mdash;but under a solemn promise of betraying
me to nobody&mdash;that I was a physician, disguised as
a military man to avoid the annoyance of consultations.
The secret was soon buzzed about, and immediately
the whole party paid court to no one but
the healer of human bodies. Each individual contrived
in turns some opportunity cunningly to introduce
the topics of health and disease, and in a
discreet way to consult me on all his complaints,
past, present, and future. One Arab only of the
suite was endowed with so perversely good a constitution,
as not to be able to discover in himself the
symptom of a single lurking ailment, and feelingly
lamented his ill-luck in being obliged to forego so
fine an opportunity for a cure. The first medicines
I began to distribute in my own defence were mere
balls of bread and soap; but I soon found the bowels
of the company too refractory for so gentle a prescription.
I therefore made bold to purloin some portion
of a bale of ipecacuanha, directed to the missionaries
at Bagdad, which I knew by the smell, and mixing it
with some gunpowder, found the means to move

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

and to satisfy my friends. They were particular
rather as to the vehemence than the mode in which
the medicine acted. A man in a fever slily drank
off the restorative I had prepared for one with an
abscess; and one in the colic poured into his stomach
the lotion intended for the leg of another who
had broken his shin: but these trifles affected not
my reputation. It presently grew so splendid, that
in our evening halts I no longer dared to stir out of
the khan where we stopped, for fear of being forcibly
dragged away to feel pulses. Fortunately the crossing
of the small desert, which we preferred to coasting
the banks of the Tigris, enabled me to drop my
assumed character, by interrupting for a while the
afflux of patients. I declared I was not a physician;
and immediately the complaints of my travelling
companions, which they thought radically
cured, all returned upon them with double force.</p>

<p>Making a halt between Nissabeen and Moossool,
we came in contact with a party of travellers, whose
route crossed our track, and who halted near our
own resting-place. At first our guides and the
strangers conversed together very amicably, but
presently high words arose between them, and the
quarrel at last became so loud and violent that I
expected it to end in a pitched battle. We thought
it wisest not to interfere, and contented ourselves
with listening attentively. For a long while, however,
none of us could make any thing of the dispute,

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

except that it was about some great personage,
whom, it seems, our Arabs had not mentioned with
becoming reverence. When the matter came to be
explained, this personage turned out to be the devil.
The strangers were Yezidees; a sect who maintain
that, whether Satan be at present in or out of favour
in heaven, he continues not the less to exert great
sway on earth, and therefore ought to be treated
with proper respect; and, as they think it wise to
make friends every where&mdash;not knowing where their
destiny may ultimately fix them&mdash;they judiciously
divide their worship between the powers of light and
of darkness. The party in question was on a pilgrimage
from mount Sindjar their residence, to the
tomb of Schaich Adi their patron.</p>

<p>Hearing all these circumstances, I immediately
walked over to these worthy people, and begged
most earnestly to state to them that we were all in
reality much more in his satanic majesty's interests
than we pretended; requested for my own share
particularly to have a good word spoken for me in
their prayers to him, and, after mutual civilities on
parting, very respectfully wished them at the devil.</p>

<p>This gentleman, variously treated, continued, for
several days after, to engross our whole conversation;&mdash;some
thinking it spoke well for themselves
to abuse him without moderation; others observing
that after all he owed not only his existence but his
propensities, like every created being, to the author

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

of all good; and could only act under express authority.&mdash;This
position was chiefly maintained, but
very mildly, by a fat, sleek, ruddy-faced Armenian,
who nominally resided at Yulfa,<sup id="r279"><a href="#n279">279</a></sup> but whose real
abode was any part of the road between Turkey,
Persia, and India. Already had he spent, in carrying
merchandise backward and forward between
those countries, two good thirds of man's ordinary
span of life; and still did he as little as ever meditate
a more tranquil mode of existence for the remainder
of his days. It is true that, though maallim
Moorsa's body was in constant motion, his mind
seemed stationary, and neither to advance nor to
retrograde an inch: and it was no doubt owing to
the complete repose of his intellectual part, that the
corporeal portion so well stood the fatigue which he
made it undergo. With him the sword, so far from
wearing out the scabbard, appeared of no use but
to keep that scabbard properly poised, amid the incessant
jolting of his horse or camel.</p>

<p>"Tell me, maallim Moorsa," said I one day, as
we stopped to water our beasts of burthen, "what
can tempt you, at your age and with your fortune,
to toil harder, and to allow yourself fewer indulgences
than the meanest of your own domestics;
and, far from home and friends, to spend your
days jolting on a rough-paced dromedary, and your
nights sweltering in a wretched berth? Are hunger,
thirst, burning sands, nipping blasts, tormenting

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

insects, venomous reptiles, extortionary guides, rapacious
enemies, ruinous engagements, and unexpected
losses so very indispensable to your happiness,
that you must travel hundreds and hundreds
of miles in search of these little adventitious enjoyments?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," answered the placid Armenian,
"It is habit, all powerful habit, which makes me
live as I do;&mdash;habit, more persuasive than the suggestions
of reason, and the remonstrances of friends.
When first I commenced my wandering mode of
life, I only intended to continue it during a limited
period. The repose at home which followed each
journey seemed short, the setting out afresh was
irksome: I reluctantly quitted a young and handsome
wife, a group of fond and playful children and
a set of jovial and hospitable friends, for new fatigues
and dangers; and never did I start without
saying to myself,&mdash;'well! let me only possess a
decent competency, and I shall sit down never more
to move, until packed up like my own goods, and
carried to the grave!'</p>

<p>"But mark the sequel! As years rolled on, my
wife grew old and cross, my children left me to set
up separate establishments, my convivial friends
became sedate and parsimonious, and I myself by
degrees began to lose, in my lonely journeys, my
former keen relish for society. As with my increasing
wealth my ideas of a decent competency

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

enlarged, my taste for the things it was intended to
secure diminished. Instead of feeling a greater impatience
to get home, and more pleasure in staying
under my own roof, I found precisely the reverse to
be the case. I now travel homewards more leisurely;
I am able to sleep more soundly on the
night which precedes my arrival; and the happiness
of being with my family sooner loses its zest.
My increasing torpor of mind and of body more
speedily crave that excitement which only the bustle
of the caravan can give: the desire of returning to
my business and journeys revives more quickly:
I am bent with greater force upon still achieving
one last lucrative expedition ere I sit down for ever;
and I can less bear the idea of already cooping
myself up, like the worm in the web of its own
weaving, for the whole of the time previous to my
final change."</p>

<p>"Man, man!" cried I, "struggle against this
increasing restlessness; or what good are your riches
to do yourself or others?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I have struggled!" replied the Armenian.
"It was but the very last time of my being at home
that I said to myself: 'maallim Moorsa, maallim
Moorsa, dost thou mean never to be quiet? Thy
daughters are well married, thy sons in excellent
business, thou possessest three times as much as
with thy old Rachel thou canst spend in the most
profuse living. Then wander not any longer about

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

the world, like one bereft of house and home; but,
by staying among thy friends, and giving up all further
ventures, secure thyself from the risk of losses
and sorrows,'&mdash;and thereupon I forced myself to
try to enter into all the various enjoyments of a
sedentary life. But alas! the thing would not do:
I soon found a noisome evil steal upon me, penetrate
my inmost marrow, and spoil the relish of all
my pleasure. It was not loss; it was not sorrow:
but it was far more intolerable than either;&mdash;it was
ennui! An insuperable listlessness took possession
of my being, a nausea past all enduring pursued me
incessantly. In the midst of friends, of good cheer,
and of comforts of every description, I cast a look
of envy upon every human being who set out to
encounter new fatigues and dangers. The recital of
the speculations, the purchases, the sales, the commissions
and the profits of other merchants, made
my heart bound, and my mouth water with longing.
My own existence, while unemployed in similar
transactions, appeared to me a mere blank,&mdash;or
rather, a gloomy expanse of entire darkness; and
my melancholy and pining must at last have brought
me prematurely to the grave, had not, on the urgent
entreaties of my friends, a sensible physician been
called in to consider of my case:&mdash;for my mental
uneasiness had by this time degenerated into an
actual disease of the body, which seemed to threaten
a fatal termination!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

<p>"And what could he prescribe"&mdash;cried I&mdash;"in
a case of this nature? was it rhubarb or senna;
emollients or tonics?"</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor the other; but two hundred
pieces of shawl, with the addition of as many bales
of silk as I had room for, to be bought in Cashmeer,
and to be sold at Smyrna. The very prescription
made me revive. The moment I set about taking
the remedy, I felt like a fish put back into the
water: my decaying strength returned, and my
fading cheek resumed its healthy hue."</p>

<p>"Your case," said I, shrugging up my shoulders,
"I see, is hopeless."</p>

<p>"I fear it is," answered Moorsa. "I have lived
a constant traveller, and a traveller, I suppose, I
shall die. On these roads on which I spent my
youth and manhood, I feel destined to end my
days. But I do not much repine at this ordination:
it affords me a pleasure which no other could
give. I talk not of that of seeing different manners
and customs. Those are things we Armenians care
little about. But while abroad, I fancy that all the
beings I possess at home are angels; and I never
stay at home long enough to be undeceived."</p>

<p>This account of maallim Moorsa struck me forcibly:
it sounded like a warning. If a heavy Armenian,
with a comfortable home, had found roving
habits take, through dint of constant indulgence,
such root in his constitution, as to despair of ever

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

throwing them off, how much more was a state of
incurable restlessness likely to become the confirmed
disease of one who, like me, was by nature averse
from domestication, and had not been able to wrest
from fortune the least little clod of earth, on which
to sit down, when tired of rambling, as in a spot subject
to my own rule, but, like the loose sands in the
desert, ever remained liable to be blown about from
place to place, by every slightest gust of wind. I
felt so alarmed at the danger, that I determined to
avoid it, by fixing myself on the first opportunity.
Already I possessed in my little Alexis a polar star,
to which began to point all my thoughts, all my
wishes,&mdash;a magnet, whose attraction I felt even
when steering in a contrary direction. Him I
should some day have near me, him I should educate,
him I should make the sole object of my care: but
to execute that project I must have a home; I
must have means:&mdash;and in search of that home,
and of those means, I must for the present go on
wandering as before.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the thirty-ninth day of our departure from
Aleppo, at the sixth hour of the afternoon, parched,
dusty and cross, we reached a vast suburb of mud,
traversed a long bridge of boats, and found ourselves
in the celebrated city of Bagdad. As we
slowly advanced towards our resting-place, I could
not help exclaiming at every step, "Is this the
capital of Haroon-al-raschid? this the residence of
Zobe&iuml;d&eacute;? this the favourite scene of eastern romance?
Alas! how fallen from its ancient splendor!"</p>

<p>Suleiman still governed the vast pashalik of Bagdad;
the last and highest fruit of many successive
vicissitudes and promotions. A Georgian by birth,
and by condition a mamluke, he had in 1775, on
the death of his predecessor and patron, been appointed
to the mootsellimlik of Basra. Besieged
in that city by Kherim-khan, the usurper of the
Persian monarchy, he held out fifteen months ere
he surrendered the place; was, in consequence of
the capitulation, carried a captive to Sheeras, and
after a two years' detention, had, on the death of
Kerim, the good fortune to be again restored to his
government. To this subordinate appointment the

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

Porte, in consideration of his valour and his services,
soon after added the pashalik of Bagdad, the
most extensive and powerful of the Turkish empire.</p>

<p>Long did Suleiman sustain with unexampled
dignity the weight of his manifold honours. His
warlike talents kept in awe the fierce hordes of tributary
Koords and Arabs at the two opposite extremities
of his vast province, while his justice and
moderation endeared him to the milder inhabitants
of the intervening districts. But ere I beheld his
dominions his glory had begun to fade, his resplendent
sun to set. For some time past both the body
and the mind of the mighty Suleiman seemed to
have lapsed from their former energy into a state
of imbecility and torpor. Achmet, once a groom
in Suleiman's stable, now held in his stead the reins
of empire. In the capacity of the Pasha's kehaya,
he enjoyed both the direction of his councils and
the command of his armies: but he was not content
merely to represent&mdash;he totally superseded his
master. Suleiman was forgotten in his favourite;
and while the Pasha only resembled the inert idol
concealed in the sanctuary, the kehaya was the
high-priest, who, holding the keys of the adytum,
ruled with an high hand the worshippers, and swept
away all the offerings left upon the altar.</p>

<p>My former situation and services in Turkey procured
me access to this all powerful personage. I
was received at his levee with the utmost courtesy.

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

Nothing, indeed, could be more fascinating than
Achmet's exterior. His features were fine, his
figure noble, his manners dignified yet mild, his
wit playful without pungency: he seemed to promote
unrestrained liberty of speech, even where it
attacked most directly his opinion and interests:
his own expressions often dropped as if from an unguarded
lip and a guileless heart. He spoke with
affability to all, and never ceased bewailing the
pomp his situation required. No passion ever
could be perceived to disturb the serenity of his
countenance or the placidity of his temper. He
would occasionally perform acts of great liberality;
always expressed his repugnance to harsh or cruel
measures, and, when compelled by reasons of state
to sign the death warrant even of an enemy, shed
tears of sympathy which he seemed afraid to show.</p>

<p>But most deceitful was this fair outside. If angry
passions never ruffled Achmet's countenance, or
fierce resentment never found a vent at Achmet's
lips, they only rankled the more in the recesses of
his impenetrable bosom. Humble in his manner,
his heart swelled with unbounded pride: for every
piastre he gave in gifts, his agents doubled their
exactions tenfold: his aversions, his hatreds, undiscoverable
in the presence of their object, broke out
with greater virulence in distant times and places.
The more he expatiated on the pleasure of pardoning,
the more certain it was that he meditated some

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

act of signal revenge; and, if he sighed at being
obliged to represent his master, it was because he
longed for Suleiman's death, to be master himself.</p>

<p>Achmet had for some time been waging war in
the Pasha's name with a religious sect, considered
by the Turks as new and heretical, which daily
acquired greater extension in Arabia, under the
name of Wahhabees. As I was destined soon to
come into contact with its followers, a short sketch
of its origin and progress may not be inapposite in
this place.</p>

<p>Islamism had found in the arid but extensive province
of Nedjd&mdash;the inmost kernel of the Arabian
desert&mdash;not only its first cradle, but its firmest subsequent
bulwark. While among the stationary
and close-pressed population of the surrounding
districts the doctrine of the koran had become
speedily subject to fermentation and to change, and
had by degrees ramified into numberless diversities
of belief and of practice, the more hostile to each
other in proportion as they presented less difference,
it continued among the children of Anahs&eacute;, of
Ka&iuml;bar and of Ta&iuml;&mdash;few in number, distant in
abode, thinly diffused over an immense and sterile
desert, and ever moving from one part of its surface
to another&mdash;to be transmitted from father to
son in all its primitive purity. The erratic life of
these Bedoweens allowed them little time to exhaust
their intellect in idle speculations, to perplex

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

their conscience with imaginary difficulties, and to
pervert their creed by absurd explanations: it withheld
from them the means of burthening their communities
with a cumbrous hierarchy, or to waste
their leisure on a complicated ritual; and throughout
their vast but indefinite domain, the text of the
prophet continued in every age the only rule of
the individual, the desert his only temple, and the
leader of his tribe his only imam or priest. That
constant motion to which the stream owes its limpidity,
preserved the faith of the wandering Arab
from alloy, and his practices from corruption. Precisely,
however, because the more undeviating adherence
of the roving Bedoween to the original revelation
of Mohammed had never been superseded
by later doctrines, nor had clashed with subtler and
more complicated tenets, it was never embodied by
those that professed it into a separate code, nor
stamped with a separate name, intended to distinguish
these more orthodox Mussulmen from the remainder
of the followers of Mohammed. They
therefore attracted attention and excited obloquy
the less, as their dispersion and their weakness prevented
them from attempting to extend their faith,
or to gain converts to their doctrine, but on the
contrary made them readily display a temporary
assimilation of their external practices with whatever
ramification of the Mohammedan religion they

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

were led amongst, either in the pursuit of business
or of pleasure&mdash;in the tending of their flocks, or in
the conduct of their caravans; and this the more
easily, as their own worship was divested of peculiar
forms, and their feelings towards the followers of a
different doctrine free from that hatred which only
arises from daily conflict.</p>

<p>But totally different became the case when the
primitive opinions here set forth, no longer confined
to the roving children of the sterile Nedjd,
began by degrees to insinuate themselves among
the stationary population thickly crowded in the
fertile districts of Ared;&mdash;when that creed which
had been cherished only in silence in the lonely
tent, became the topic of daily converse in towns
and in villages. It was then that the belief adopted
from the neighbouring Bedoween, marking more
forcibly by greater approximation its difference
from the tenets to which a more civilised Islamism
had by degrees degenerated, began to excite attention,
to produce enmity, and to cause among its
followers a closer union with each other, and a more
entire separation from those that remained faithful
to their paternal creed.</p>

<p>And this happened towards the close of the
seventeenth Christian century. At that period the
most eminent of the districts of Ared,&mdash;that of the
Ayani,&mdash;was ruled by a Schaich of the name of

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

Suleiman, descended from the same family of the Kore&iuml;sch&mdash;now
reduced to a few obscure individuals&mdash;whence
sprung the last of prophets. This schaich derived
his chief income from the numerous herds of
camels which he let out on hire, according to the custom
of his country, and which yielded him an immense
profit, especially at that season of the year when the
Indian Mohammedans, performing their pilgrimage
to the holy house, disembarked at Katif, and traversed
Ared in their way to Mekkah:&mdash;but, loaded with
riches, Suleiman remained long unblessed with progeny.
In his old age, however, and when he no
longer had any hope of offspring, heaven most unexpectedly
bestowed on him a son.</p>

<p>Extraordinary deviations from the regular course
of nature are always remembered to have taken
place at the birth of extraordinary personages;&mdash;and,
when the son of Suleiman rose to be the founder
of a new sect, the proselytes to his doctrine failed
not to record the phenomena which their predecessors
had witnessed. Be it known, therefore, that,
at the birth of this high-fated child, an universal
tremor convulsed the air, shook the earth, and
made every mosque that stands upon the ground
totter unto its foundations, and every minaret that
shoots up in the sky topple on its base: and while,
during several successive nights, cities, villages,
cattles and fields shone with a preternatural and

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

brilliant light, the lamps which burned in the sepulchral
chambers of Mohammed and of the other
saints of Islamism went out, as if in anticipation of
the fate that awaited them, in spite of every effort
of imams and of snuffers.</p>

<p>Abd-ool-wahhab, or the slave of the Most High,
was the name given to the infant thus peculiarly
marked as the favourite of heaven. He was sent at
an early age to study the law in the most celebrated
medress&eacute;s of Damascus, and there learnt from the
subtlest of Mohammedan doctors themselves the
best method of impugning the corruptions of their
creed. Accordingly, he no sooner returned among
his fellow citizens, ripe for a reform in their faith,
than he began publicly to preach the necessity of
an entire abandonment of the corrupt tenets and
superstitious practices, which had so long disgraced
Islamism.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Abd-ool-wahhab has been represented
as pure deism:&mdash;but nothing can be less consonant
with truth than this assertion. The son of
Suleiman not only maintained most strenuously the
divine origin of the koran; he might even be said
to have rendered it the chief object of his reform to
restore to the sacred text all its primitive importance
and weight, by rejecting every article of faith or
rule of conduct subsequently derived even from the
oral precepts of the prophet himself; by disencumbering

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

the book divinely revealed of all the commentaries
with which, in the course of time, its
pages had been burthened; and by loudly proclaiming
that, without any adventitious aid, the
words brought from heaven by the Angel Gabriel
were alone able to supply all the spiritual wants of
the faithful:&mdash;for while Abd-ool-wahhab regarded
the koran as received directly from the Most High,
he considered even Mohammed its first promulgator
as only an ordinary man, endowed with no superhuman
character, no gift of miracles, nay no peculiar
sanctity whatever, transferable to his own deeds
or sayings, as distinct from the sacred rescripts
showered leaf by leaf upon him; and, above all, he
treated the stamp of holiness affixed on other individuals&mdash;imams,
doctors, or expounders of the
law&mdash;blazoned forth in the later ages of Islamism,
together with the pilgrimages performed to peculiar
tombs, and the virtues attributed to peculiar relics,
as absolute idolatry: whence, like every other apostle
of a new doctrine, who only bows his head submissively
to older established worships, while his
own still totters in the weakness of infancy, but
raises his hands against them the moment his innovations
have acquired sufficient strength,&mdash;the first
pious performance Abd-ool-wahhab enjoined his new
disciples (as soon as enabled to achieve it) was the
destruction of the chapels of Mekkah and Medina,

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

of Imam-Aly and Imam-Husse&iuml;n; where Sunnees
and Scheyees yearly unite in devout orisons to the
ashes of pretended saints. Their dust was, like that
of the desert, to be scattered in the wind; and the
treasures which adorned their monuments were to
reward the piety of their despoilers.</p>

<p>When about the middle of the eighteenth century,
Abd-ool-wahhab&mdash;oppressed with years of renown
and sanctity&mdash;was at last gathered unto his
fathers, his son Mohammed, educated like himself
in the study of the law, and consequently also distinguished
by the title of moollah, succeeded him as
preacher of the new doctrine. Moollah Mohammed
gave himself more wholly up to its internal light,
since that from without cheered not his eyes&mdash;struck
from his birth with incurable blindness. This circumstance
indeed prevented him from leading out
his proselytes himself, in the wars for the defence
or propagation of his new creed, but moollah Mohammed's
achievements in battle could be dispensed
with: the irrefragable truth of Wahhabism had
already found a champion famed for martial exploits
in Ibn-Sehood, the supreme ruler of Ared, who resided
at Derayeh, and who became the temporal
chief of the Wahhabees, while moollah Mohammed
remained their spiritual leader.</p>

<p>From the moment that the new doctrine, adopted
by old-established princes, became enabled to add

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

the force of arms to that of arguments, it made rapid
and extensive progress. Almost immediately on its
promulgation, its more recent name had sanctioned
the tenets already professed time out of mind by
the roving tribes of the desert; and soon after its
establishment in the Ared, the stationary Schaichs
of the province of Kherdj enlisted under its banners.
It now rapidly approached the Hedjas; and the
Shereef of Mekkah, the guardian of the Kaaba, began
to tremble for his power and for his dominions.
Loudly inveighing against the apathy with which
other states saw the danger approach them, he determined
to avert it from the realms he ruled, by
promoting a powerful diversion.</p>

<p>To the eastward of the Nedjd extends the half
desert half cultivated province of Hadjar; the ancient
domain of the mighty tribe of Beni Haled.
One part of the year, Ibn-Arar its chief roves with
his tents over the boundless plain, the other part
he resides in El-Hassa the capital. This city once
recognised the authority of the Sultan; but has
since been reclaimed by its Arab founders. Turkish
fortifications, however, still surround its precincts,
and Turkish families form a principal part of its
population. Its ayals or primates bore the Wahhabees,
both in their quality as Osmanlees and as
Sunnees, a peculiar hatred. Thence the Shereef of
Mekkah found little difficulty in exciting them to

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

hostilities against the spreading heretics. Arar took
up arms and marched to Derayeh.</p>

<p>Already had internal anarchy and dissensions
begun to shake to its foundations the new doctrine.
Nothing therefore seems more probable than that,
like many older heresies, that of the Wahhabees
would have blazed an instant in the district where
it arose, and then have sunk again for ever into
irretrievable oblivion, had not the unseasonable
interference of strangers providentially preserved
it from so inglorious a fate. The danger which
threatened the Wahhabees from without, forced
them to stifle their internal feuds. They united
for common defence and safety. Sehood, before
harassed by continual murmurings and mutinies,
now found his subjects all obedience and zeal. And
after several years of warfare with Arar, instead of
the children of Beni-Haled getting nearer Derayeh,
the sons of Wahhab had sensibly approached El-Hassa.</p>

<p>As soon as Abd-ool-azeez, the son and successor
of Ibn-Sehood, felt himself secure on the side of
Hadjar, he turned his views towards Mekkah. Revenge
as well as avarice animated him against the
chief of this rich and holy city. But where all lived
upon what he came to destroy, he found but few
friends within the walls disposed to second his attempts
from without. It was only at the close of

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

the third campaign that he got sight of the fortress
of Tayif, situated on a high mountain at a small
distance from Mekkah; and before he could lay
siege to the place, the death of his spiritual partner,
moollah Mohammed&mdash;whose earthly career had extended
to near a century&mdash;forced him, by the confusion
it caused among his followers, to return to
Derayeh.</p>

<p>The Shereef of Mekkah thought this the time
for changing his defensive into an offensive war,
and pursued the Wahhabees into their own territory.
There, however, these sectaries, rapidly
facing about with their strength now refreshed,
routed his harassed army so completely, that he
was hardly able, in his flight, to reach the gates
of his capital.</p>

<p>The Porte now awoke from its trance, and began
to feel some alarm at the progress of the new
sect. The Sultan directed the Pasha of Bagdad
to provide for the defence of the holy city; and
the Pasha of Bagdad transmitted the Sultan's instructions
to his vassals, the Arab schaichs of Montefih
and of Beni-Haled. Both chiefs prepared
immediately to obey: but the schaich of Montefih
was murdered by a disguised Wahhabee, in his
own tent; and the schaich of Beni-Haled, after
an unsuccessful campaign, saw El-Hassa his capital
sacked by the victorious enemy, who took Sobier

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

by storm, made Basra tremble, and threatened
Meschid-Aly with annihilation.</p>

<p>Suleiman's kehaya at last determined to advance
in person. In 1793,&mdash;the year before my arrival
at Bagdad,&mdash;he had succeeded in making Abd-ool-azeez
evacuate his new conquests, and return, though
with immense plunder, to Derayeh. Great consternation
continued, nevertheless, to prevail at Bagdad;
for the Wahhab doctrine had now extended
its sway to almost every part of Arabia north of
Yemen, and had gained the very core of the tribe
of Montefih itself, hitherto considered as the chief
bulwark of the Othoman empire against the new
sectaries. It is true, the Turkish mob tried to hush
its fears by asking with a sneer what could be effected
by an undisciplined rabble, armed only with
matchlocks, against regular armies and fortified
places; but the shrewder part of the community
felt that no temporary check could ensure a vast
province vulnerable in every point, an empire tottering
to its base, and a militia enervated by sloth
and luxury, against a race of men with bodies of
steel, with souls of fire, whose own abode was the
inaccessible heart of the desert; whose appearance
in other quarters resembled that of the unlooked-for
hurricane; whose patience of fatigues, hardships,
and privations exceeded all idea, as their rapidity of
motion baffled all calculation; who, heeding neither

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

heat, nor hunger, nor yet thirst, performed with
a rapidity which no other troops could emulate,
marches of a length in which no other troops
could follow them; who fell in the most sudden
manner on the points most distant from those prepared
for their reception; who, on the smallest
reverse, always had their sands open behind them,
to retire to beyond the reach of pursuit; whose
obedience to their chiefs in whatever concerned the
interests of their new creed knew no bounds, while
their bravery in battle and their contempt of death
were fed by a fanaticism far exceeding the long
worn-out zeal of the Turks; and who, in all their
expeditions, were equally animated by the interests
of religion, and by the hopes of plunder. Nay, timid
men pretended that in the very midst of Bagdad,
in the broad face of day, Wahhabees had been
seen&mdash;scarcely disguised&mdash;taking note of the individuals
and marking the houses, which their
vengeance or their avarice had devoted to destruction.</p>

<p>Mean while Achmet kehaya was preparing to
employ the leisure which the temporary retreat of
these sectaries had left him, in an expedition against
the district of Kara-Djoolan, one of the fiefs of the
pashalik of Bagdad. Its Coordish inhabitants had
of their own authority appointed one of their countrymen
as governor; and this new delegate was

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

trying to obtain the Pasha's confirmation by force
of arms.</p>

<p>I offered to raise a corps of dellis for this expedition,
and was accepted. Knowing despatch to
be the soul of war, I did not stickle much in my
recruits for age or size, and when my bairak<sup id="r280"><a href="#n280">280</a></sup> was
complete, had the satisfaction of seeing it present
a most agreeable variety of ages and statures:&mdash;but
what of that? courage was not measured by
the inch, nor bravery estimated according to the
length of the beard. With my raw recruits I was
ready for the kehaya, long before this renowned
warrior was ready for me.</p>

<p>Babel's ancient confusion of tongues still seems
to prevail at Bagdad. Turks, Persians, Indians,
Jews, Egyptians, Greeks, and Arabs were constantly
vying, which, in their various dialects, should
outbawl the other. Among the motley group collected
in the market-place, the fat paunch and ruddy
face of maallim Moorsa often shone pre-eminent.
Whenever he saw me, he failed not to hail his old
travelling companion; and, one day that his mercantile
transactions left him at leisure, he introduced
the captain of dellis to some Ispahan merchants, who
had left their country on the dissensions which followed
the elevation of the eunuch Aga Mohammed.
They were scheyees, and certainly, in the eyes of
a true sunnee, a very abominable set of people;

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

for not only did they maintain Aly to be first in
rightful succession to Mohammed, and not Aboo-bekr;
but they made no scruple of carrying little
paintings of pretty faces in their books of poetry.
It was shocking to behold!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such extreme relaxation of
morals, I could not help thinking my Persians
agreeable companions enough. They were the
first men whom I had found anxious to mix with
drudgery of trade the refinements of literature.
One of them in particular, Aboo-Reza by name,
possessed a very pretty turn for poetry himself.
His imagination, it is true, was not of that soaring
order which, like the eagle, rises far above the surface
of the earth, and embraces in its rapid glance
those distant similitudes only viewed from the high
vault of the heavens. It rather resembled the playful
butterfly which, hovering near the enamelled
surface of the field, is content to sip, in gaudy attire,
the honied cup of each humble daisy half concealed
among the herbage. He was happy in the art of seizing
the <i>&agrave;-propos</i> of the moment, the flitting shadow of
the insect in its noon-day flight: and his impromptu
verses on the events of the day were, by his friends,
extolled far above the productions of Hafeez and
of Ferdoosi,&mdash;poets grown, as it was thought, somewhat
musty with age. The most felicitous fits of inspiration
used to seize him, when half a dozen of

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

us were assembled in a little back room, over a
large bowl of a certain ruby-coloured liquor, whose
fumes seem in all ages to have had the property
of exciting the poetic fervour. It was then that
his eyes began to sparkle, and his lips to pour
forth almost as many involuntary effusions, as
they admitted voluntary draughts of the inspiring
nectar.</p>

<p>One evening Aboo-Reza looked so much more
solemn than usual, that all wondered what monstrous
mouse the mountain was going to produce.
It kept us not long in suspense. Striking&mdash;for the
purpose of inforcing silence&mdash;against the sonorous
vessel round which we were seated: "Mourn,
Persia, mourn!" roared the expanding merchant:&mdash;"When
the ancient gem of the empire, the
primeval seat of the sovereign, the once proud
and populous Ispahan lost its charms in the eyes
of its master; when the rude hand of the intruder
Time was suffered to rob its golden domes of their
rich enamelled zones, and to wrap its silver lakes
in veils of nauseous slime; when its crystal fountains
only continued to play to the hooting owl,
and its shady arbours to shelter the howling fox;&mdash;when
the king of kings cast the radiance of his
favour no longer on the stately matron robed in
gold, but on the warmer concubine crowned with
roses; when gay Sheeraz, flushed with sparkling

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

wine, received him in her bosom,&mdash;then began
trouble and confusion to spread throughout the
land; then burst open on all sides the flood-gates
of purple blood!&mdash;But when the whirlwind of
frightful war again tore up the blazing throne of
the Sofis, scarcely rooted in the South, and on its
iron wings carried the canopy of state to the frozen
tracts of the North; when the gemmed carpet of
the sovereign, erst sprinkled with violets, was spread
on sheets of ice; when the benumbing shadow of
frowning Demawend obscured the very brow of the
ruler, and darkened the serenity of his once smiling
aspect,&mdash;then indeed did the genius of the chilling
blast imprint on snows that melt not the seal of
Persia's doom: then rushed forth to the destruction
of Djemshid's tottering empire, every demon of
darkness; then spread far and wide over its withered
plains the baneful offspring of the polar lightning;
then did streams of ensanguined flames, crimsoning
heaven's vault itself, reflect the earth's surface,
deluged by the reeking tide;&mdash;then,&mdash;hushed all
other sounds,&mdash;was heard among the sun's orphan
children, nought but the wail of sorrow and the
cry of despair!"<sup id="r281"><a href="#n281">281</a></sup></p>

<p>Here Aboo-Reza stopped, to enjoy our admiration
and to collect our applause: but our lips continued
locked in silent wonder, at the sublime
thought of delivering the aurora borealis of an

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

array of Russian soldiers, until real sounds of war
seemed gathering at the door. All now trembled,
all turned pale; each guest fixed inquiring looks
on his neighbour, and at last, in rushed a grim detachment
of actual tangible soldiers. They were
only those of our own Pasha, however, and came
for the mere purpose of lodging us in a place of
security, as men who had attracted the attention of
the police by their secret conventicles, and could
only be conspirators against the state. The loudness
of our poetic friend's voice, while reciting his
effusion, had made this valiant troop stop at the
door to listen; and the less its members had understood
of the drift of Aboo-Reza's rhapsody, the
more they had considered it as an undeniable proof
of our guilty purpose. Nothing, they all swore,
could be so evident as that the peak of Demawend
meant the Pasha's kehaya, and that we were the
hurricane let loose for his destruction. This danger
was averted by clapping us in prison, where we
felt rather uncomfortable, notwithstanding Aboo-Reza's
assurances that, die when we might, he had
all our epitaphs ready written in his pocket.</p>

<p>A descendant of one of the tribes of Israel
was the secret instigator of this attack upon our
liberties. Formerly chief of the customs at Basra,
the Jew Abd-allah had been removed from that
situation on some complaint of the English factory.

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

He was since become at Bagdad not only the cashier,
but the chief counsellor of the kehaya, whose financial
operations he managed entirely. Achmet would
sooner have affronted many a great man in office
than his little Jew. Abd-allah, leaving his ancient
wife, with his old employment, at Basra, had entirely
new furnished his harem at Bagdad; and it
was said that, in honour of the young bud of the
tribe of Israel with whom he adorned his new
establishment, he abstained three whole days from
usury&mdash;the sabbath however included. Little had
this proof of love availed him. The fascinating
Sarah made but an inadequate return for such
sacrifices; and while the husband passed his mornings
with the kehaya, one or other of the kehaya's
officers used to beguile the solitude of the wife.
Anxious to get some money advanced me upon my
bairak, I went several times to the seraff's. Sarah,
from her grated balcony, espied my visits to her
husband's serdar,<sup id="r282"><a href="#n282">282</a></sup> and seemed determined to console
me for his backwardness. But as well might
the fair Israelite have tried to communicate her
new flame to a heap of ashes, as to my anguished,
worn-out heart. It was proof against all her attractions
natural and acquired.</p>

<p>Among Jews and among gentiles, in scripture
and in fable, in ancient times and in modern, it has
been the invariable rule for ladies to accuse of too

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

much warmth those in whom they found too little.
Sarah departed not from the established rule. She
represented me as having manifested a slight opinion
of her virtue; and her husband was delighted to
see its severity thus confirmed. He had heard of
my nocturnal meetings with the Persian merchants.
Forthwith he denounced us to the kehaya as guilty
of treasonable practices; but, on an investigation,
those of his wife alone came to light.</p>

<p>Our liberation followed speedily. The indignity
of the imprisonment, however, rankled in my mind,
and I swore to the kehaya an irreconcilable hatred.
From different causes, many other worthy inhabitants
of Bagdad shared in this feeling; and a small
knot of us, chiefly officers of the jenissaries, never
met without very freely expressing our resentment.
One evening, in an armourer's shop where we used
frequently to assemble, we began by some chance
mimicking a Greek superstitious practice. I knotted
a handkerchief into a little puppet, christened it
Achmet, and, after loading it with invectives, invited
the party to plunge their swords into the little
kehaya. Not until he was fairly demolished did
we perceive&mdash;squatted in a dark corner of the shop&mdash;an
Arab, who had been cheapening a lot of
muskets. He seemed as little anxious to be noticed
by us, as we were pleased to discover him: but our
conversation had been in Turkish, and we gave

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

ourselves little concern about the impression which
our sallies might make on a Bedoween.</p>

<p>A few evenings after this meeting, as I passed
through a back street far away from my lodging, I
saw myself rather abruptly approached by a man
enveloped in his abbah, who had been observing
me for some time. I clapped my hand on my pistol:
but the stranger, assuring me he came in peace,
only begged a moment's audience, in some place
where no one might overhear our discourse. I made
a sign to him to walk on before me, and when we
got to an open area, bade him stop at some distance,
and disclose his mysterious business.</p>

<p>He first disclosed his person:&mdash;opening his cloak,
he asked whether I remembered him.</p>

<p>"You are," replied I, "the Arab of Montefih,
whom we met the other evening in Feristah's shop."</p>

<p>"Not of Montefih, thank God!" cried the
stranger, shaking his head; "not of that amphibious
race, half Turk, half Arab, which pretends to respect
the Bedoween, and yet pays tribute to the Pasha.
Mine is a purer blood and a less corrupt creed. I
am a son of Anahse, and a follower of Wahhab.
Only to serve my faith do I stoop to wear the garb
of my enemies: only to seek among my foes the
weapons with which to slay them do I breathe their
foul atmosphere. You perhaps think my mission
dangerous,&mdash;and so truly it may be in the sense of
the world:&mdash;but know that, nevertheless, for one

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

of us who falls in the performance of this task,
fifty are found imploring to fill his place. We
fear little on earth, whose wreath of glory is weaving
in heaven! Your hatred to the kehaya is known
to equal our utmost abhorrence of the merciless
slave. Many a time have I stood unnoticed by
your side, listening to your discourse and watching
your actions, when you dared to paint him in his
true colours. Then join, if not our belief, at least
our measures. We want not bravery, nor zeal,
but tactics and discipline. Such as bring among
us military skill may expect the highest honours.
Leisurely consult your feelings, and let me have
your answer."</p>

<p>This answer I felt ready enough to give on the
spot, provided I knew my friend commissioned to
take it. I saw little prospect of advantage in staying
at Bagdad, and I was inclined to try the Wahhabees.
All I required on the part of the Arab
was a sight of his credentials. In proof of his mission,
he took off his turban and showed me his bare
head:&mdash;it had not the lock of hair which other
Mohammedans leave as a handle by which to be
taken up to heaven. In further confirmation of his
character, he pulled out of his bosom the signet of
his leader; and as a third testimonial, he offered to
introduce me to a conventicle of Arabs and others,
friendly to his sect, who would vouch for his veracity.
This party I saw, and was satisfied. Determining

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

upon the journey, I received the seal of the
fraternity, and settled the day on which I was to be
furnished with the letters and other instruments,
which the Arab purposed to commit to my care.</p>

<p>As I went home, I met one of those Tartar messengers
of the Pasha, who, like maallim Moorsa,
spend their lives on the road, but, only carrying
words instead of wares, fly like lightning where the
merchants creep like slugs. This man, Feiz-ullah
by name, had served the Capitan-Pasha during his
short Visirate. I had done him some service on
the banks of the Danube, which he now took the
opportunity of repaying on those of the Tigris.
"My friend Mehemet and myself were on the watch
for you," cried he, as soon as he saw me. "What
you may have done, we know not, nor care to know:
but what will be done to you, if you stay, we can
pretty well guess. In a long conference between the
kehaya and the Jenissary-Aga, of which I caught a
few words, your name was so frequently mentioned,
and so angrily blended with the terms of conspiracy,
secret meetings and Wahhabees, that I slipped out
ere I got my message, in order to warn you not to
stay till it is given me. As you value your life,
leave Bagdad immediately.&mdash;Ishallah!<sup id="r283"><a href="#n283">283</a></sup> you will be
safe among the robbers of the desert."</p>

<p>On uttering these last words, my informer was
already out of sight. I ran not after him for further
particulars. A month's pay of my troop, just

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

received, was still in my pocket; and purposing
within the hour to review my noble dellis, I had
ordered my horse round to a particular spot. Nothing
remained for me to do but to hie me thither,
and vault into my saddle. Bidding a mental adieu
to my corps, which was actually waiting for me
under arms, I borrowed its pay for my travelling
expenses, clapped spurs to my steed, got out of the
city by a circuitous route, overset a long file of
barbers going in procession to the tomb of their
patron, the Prophet's barber, at Mada&iuml;n; crossed
the bridge, traversed the suburbs, and, reaching the
outer gate, took the road to Hillah.</p>

<p>Divided in two by the Euphrates, and encompassed
by delightful gardens, that city might, after
a fatiguing journey, have tempted a less hurried
traveller to repose; but I feared its constant intercourse
with Bagdad, and pushed on to Kefil, where
I stopped a few hours. Refreshed by my halt, I
left the burying-place of the prophet Ezechiel to go
to that of the nephew of Mohammed. A wide desert
separates the two sanctuaries, and few were the
thanks which I gave the pious souls, who have built
in the burning sands that lie between them fifty
houses of prayer, and not one place of rest. My
lassitude at last grew so extreme as to throw me
into utter despair: for my faithful courser&mdash;till
then wont to ride as on the wind, and scarce to leave
the print of his hoof in the heaviest sands&mdash;seemed

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

still more worn-out than myself, was scarcely able
to set one foot before the other, and ready, at every
step, to drop down from sheer fatigue. Yet I made
him toil on&mdash;much as it grieved me&mdash;lest night
should overtake us where we must both have
perished from absolute want. At last, after several
more hours of a slow and painful progress, during
which I frequently was tempted to lie down and
breathe my last on the spot, I began to discern a
luminous speck in the horizon, as if kindled all at
once by some fairy torch. It looked from the
boundless plain like a beacon descried at night on
the wide ocean. Yet was it not a blazing fire, nor
yet a twinkling star. It was the gilt cupola of the
tomb of Aly, reflecting from its burnished surface
the last rays of the sun. Its splendor, gleaming far
in the desert, and marking amidst dreary solitudes
the busy haunts of man, restored gladness to my
drooping soul. I knew I saw the spot, however
distant, which was to end my labours. Even my
horse caught the influence. He shook his mane,
snorted, and directing his wide expanded nostril
to whence seemed to blow the tidings of certain
relief, made fresh efforts to reach the wished-for
goal. I patted him on the neck in gratitude, and,
during the remainder of my journey, kept my eye
steadily riveted on the blazing dome as on my polar
star. Anxiously I watched its increase, in order to
judge of the lessening distance; but much time still

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

elapsed, and many a wearisome step was still to
be performed, and complete darkness overcast the
lonely scene around me, ere I drew sensibly near
the end of my journey. Nor did I quit the dismal
mounds of barren sands which on all sides encompassed
my scarce perceptible path, until at the very
gates of the town. When indeed, in the uncertainty
how much further I still might have to crawl, I saw
the jagged battlements and the pointed arch rise
all at once before me at the small distance of scarce
fifty yards, I gave a scream of joy; and when I
passed under the sounding vault, dark and gloomy
as it looked, I felt as if entering the portals of
paradise.</p>

<p>Arrived at the khan, my first care was directed
to the faithful companion of my toil. I myself led
my weary steed to the stall, and with one hand
stroked his panting loins in thanks for his services,
while with the other I offered him his dearly earned
repast. Alas! he would not touch his food, turned
away from his drink, and lying down on the ground,
thrust his head between his legs, cast on me his keen
full eye, and, seized with a convulsive shivering, fell
on his side, and died.</p>

<p>"Oh my noble, my beloved steed! who bore me
through so many toils, and saved me from so many
dangers; who with such gentleness combined such
fire; whose mettle my simple whisper could repress
or raise&mdash;were then your unslackening efforts for

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

the preservation of my life to cost your own! Had
I been Sultan Mahmoud, I would have raised a
monument over your body; an Alexander, I would
have built a city to your memory: Anastasius could
only give you his tears!"</p>

<p>I looked about to replace my loss. An Arab
brought me a horse, of whose high pedigree he exhibited
the most splendid testimonials. I thought
it prudent to inquire into the character of the seller
himself. He had occasionally stopped travellers on
the road, and he might, in ordinary matters, be a
little addicted to lying as well as to thieving; but
in an affair in which his honour stood so materially
committed as in the present, he was above suspicion.
Sooner would he spill the blood of his father than
falsely warrant that of his horse. All his certificates
were authenticated: I made the purchase I could
not avoid; ate my supper, and having bestowed on
the kehaya a few hearty curses, lay down and fell
asleep.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="v3ch06">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Earlier</span> in the morning than a man might have
preferred who had gone late to rest, I was awaked
by a prodigious clamour. At first I thought Meschid-Aly
on fire; then, invaded by the Wahhabees;
but, on rising, found the noise only proceeded from
a few sunnees and scheyees, assembled round the
tomb of the saint to whom the place is consecrated,
and engaged in a trial of lungs;&mdash;each sect endeavouring
in its orisons to outbawl the other. Meschid-Aly
belongs to the sunnee inhabitants, but
derives its chief support from scheyee pilgrims.
Within its precincts, therefore, neither persuasion
dares to insult the other more grievously than by
invoking with all its might its own peculiar patron;
and the sunnees cry out Omar! and the scheyees
bawl out Aly! until want of voice reduces both
alike to dumb show.</p>

<p>Among the other strange faces, attracted like my
own by the clamour, I espied some which I was
quite sure I had left at Bagdad. This discovery
made me resolve entirely to quit the jurisdiction of
Suleiman, for the scarcely less extended domain of
the powerful Arab schaich of Montefih, whose authority

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

extends far along the banks of the Phrat,
and of the Schat-el-Arab. I therefore crossed the
city, and again plunged into the desert.</p>

<p>Winding round the western extremity of the dry
basin of Nedgef, I insensibly advanced in the lonely
waste, without precisely knowing whither I was in
the first instance going, but intending by degrees
to work my way from one lesser kabile<sup id="r284"><a href="#n284">284</a></sup> or tribe
to another, until I should reach the domain of the
Wahhabees, the final object of my journey. An
old abbah covered my Turkish dress; a sack of
rice on one side, and a cruise of water on the other,
were suspended from my saddle; and thus carrying
my bed and board, and at liberty to spread my
table and couch wherever I pleased under the
canopy of heaven, I trusted for the remainder to
my pistols and to Providence, not doubting that I
should soon reach some Bedoween camp, where I
might claim hospitality and protection.</p>

<p>Meantime, beginning to feel entirely out of reach
of my enemies, I experienced a lightness of heart,
and a freedom of breathing, to which I had for
some time been a stranger. It was rapture to me
to roam at liberty through a plain without visible
boundary, as over a trackless sea, where I might
steer my course in any direction, or make for any
point I chose, unimpeded by fence or hinderance,
and only guided while the day lasted, by the
course of the sun, and when the dusk came on,

<!-- vol 3 page 152 -->

by the glittering constellations which seemed to
succeed to his glorious employment.</p>

<p>"Here," thought I, "ends the domain of civilised
man,&mdash;of that man whose greater polish of surface
only conceals greater hardness of heart, and who
only receives a smoother edge to inflict deeper
wounds. Here gilded daggers, silken bowstrings,
and honied poisons no longer dance around my
steps: here the name of a Sultan ceases to sanction
measures which his mind never conceived, and the
shadow of a Visier to smite men whom his own arm
cannot reach: here no one obeys a sovereign he
never saw, or is bound by laws he never heard of:
here man will give, and woman will deny: here no
walls are raised to keep travellers out, nor are tolls
demanded for letting them in: no one here legally
detains the property of the stranger, nor churlishly
avoids his person. Here I may consider all things
my eyes embrace as my own; and in a succession
of short easy saunters, roam free as air unto my
journey's end!"</p>

<p>At this period of my reverie, out started from
behind a little knoll a fierce looking Bedoween,
who, couching his lance against my breast, haughtily
bade me stop. This was unexpected, and disagreeably
interrupted my exultation at my newly acquired
freedom of motion. The Arab pointed to
a small group of goat-skin tents, which I had taken
for low mounds of earth, as to the place where I

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

must go, whether I chose or not, and give an account
of the views and proceedings. Seeing my
opponent thus strongly backed, I thought it as well
for the present to waive my privilege of unrestrained
liberty, and to make a friend of him ere he had leisure
to treat me as an enemy. I therefore jumped
off my horse, flung my pistols to the ground, and
calling myself his guest, laid hold of his girdle.
Disarmed by this act of submission, he changed his
threatening tone into milder language, bade me
welcome, and offered to conduct me to the schaich.
So rapid indeed was in his breast the transition from
hostile to hospitable feelings, that he insisted by the
way on his right to entertain me himself, in consequence
of his having been the first of his troop to
see me; and could only be diverted from his purpose,
by my stating that I had special business with
the chief.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the most roomy tent in the
camp, sat, on his wicker stool, surrounded by a
number of naked children squatted on the ground,
this eminent personage. Busily engaged in teaching
a favourite grandson to hurl a hollow reed,
in imitation of the heavier spear,&mdash;too unwieldy
as yet for his infant arm,&mdash;the countenance of the
sire seemed to radiate with rapturous delight at the
feats of his anxious pupil; and his coal black eye,
still sparkling with the fire of youth, shone the
brighter from its contrast with his snow-white

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

beard,&mdash;the valued mark of his advanced age. On
seeing me unexpectedly stand before him, he gave
a start of surprise; but soon recovering his sedate,
composed look, and seeming slightly to blush for
his momentary confusion, he politely returned my
salute; and when, having previously stated my wish
to pass the night in his camp, I claimed his protection
as a defenceless wanderer, my double request
was granted with courteous readiness. The schaich's
civility stopped not here: calling out to a female
occupied in the right-hand division of the tent, and
whose exterior&mdash;as she peeped from under the
carpet which concealed her employment&mdash;seemed
the least of her merits: "Zeineb," cried he, "a
stranger is come to us; make haste and bake some
bread:" to which injunction Zeineb only replied
by setting to work. "This beginning," said I to
myself, "augurs well! Bread once broken with
my host, I am safe under his roof."</p>

<p>A few minutes sufficed for the diligent housewife
to produce her handiwork in the shape of large flat
cakes, with the distinctive mark of her own industrious
palm left impressed on the surface. These,
with some sour camel's milk, and other equally primitive
dainties, were set out before me, and I fell
to. Soon seeing me sated: "now go to repose,"
said the schaich.&mdash;"When rested, I no longer shall
hesitate to ask you who you are, whence come, and
whither going!" This respite gave me pleasure.

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

I made myself a bolster of a dromedary's pillion,
and lying down, soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>On again awaking, I found the stars already
twinkling in the firmament, as I did in their sockets
the inquisitive eyes of a dozen notables of the tribe,
ranged in a circle round the schaich to hear my
story. I took my seat beside them, and expressed
my readiness to attend to their questions. The
answers remained in my own hands. What might
be the politics of the party was as yet wholly unknown
to me, and it seemed thus far equally unsafe
to own whom I fled from, or whom I wished to
join. "I am a Turkish officer," said I; "&mdash;come
from Bagdad, and journeying to El-Hassa."</p>

<p>This seemed to surprise my hearers. "Stranger,"
cried a little shrivelled old man, with a shrewd distrustful
countenance, and a harsh grating voice,
"tell us, pray, what particular motive can induce
you, thus alone as you are, to prefer the dangerous
and difficult road of the desert, to the easy way by
Basra, Sobier, Gra&iuml;n, and Katif, which in eighteen
or twenty days at most would be sure to bring you
to your destination?"</p>

<p>The observation had a something so just and
pertinent in it, as to be rather appalling. "I am
a lover of difficulties," said I, laughing. "My
soul contracts a rust in ease: a few rubs serve to
keep it bright. Besides, I wished for an opportunity

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

of paying homage to the virtues of the
Bedowees."</p>

<p>The party were too civil to tell me to my face
that they believed this whole flourish a lie; but I
read it in their looks. They said, "they hoped
my difficulties might not exceed my wishes, and
that their virtues might answer my expectations;"
whereupon&mdash;the night advancing&mdash;they took their
leaves, and went to their respective homes.</p>

<p>As soon as I remained alone with my host: "Osmanlee,"
cried he in an earnest tone, "you conceal
your true design. And yet, why should you disguise
it? By giving us your confidence, you would
secure our good offices. Believe me; it is not from
frivolous curiosity I speak: schaich Mansoor wants
not topics for idle talk. Your own welfare makes
me anxious that those just gone from this abode, if
they have no real grounds for mistrusting you,
should not be led to harbour unfounded suspicions;&mdash;above
all, that those should not thwart your views
from mere ignorance, who, if confided in, might
assist them effectually. Should, however, the avowal
of your object be distressing to your feelings, remain
silent. I urge you no further."</p>

<p>There was in the tone as well as in the matter of
this speech a something not only so earnest but so
affectionate, as half to unlock the secret cells of my
heart. "Mansoor," said I, "a soldier in Room, I

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

fought the Sultan's battles in the name of the Prophet:
I came to Bagdad's Pasha neither wholly
destitute of rank, nor quite unknown to fame; yet
I was slighted, or, if noticed at all, it was by a proud
kehaya, only to have snares laid against my life.
From these I fly; from these I seek shelter in the
depths of the desert."</p>

<p>"And of this," cried Mansoor, "you feared to
apprise me? How unjustly! If the supreme chief,
the Kbir of Montefih himself, the daring Hameed&mdash;vulnerable
as he is on the side where his peasantry
or his flocks penetrate within the pale of Turkestan,&mdash;yet
only pays Suleiman an unwilling allegiance,
can you suppose that the lesser schaichs of his
house, roaming so much deeper in the desert,
should feel desirous to espouse the resentment, just
or unjust, of every creature of the Sultan? Ah! so
far from this being the case, rest assured that, if as
a mere stranger we greet you with good will, as a
sufferer by Achmet you may command our utmost
services. The only risk you might run would be
that of our suspecting a better understanding to
exist between you and the kehaya than you avow,
and the grievance you talk of to be only a feint,
through means of which to draw out and to discover
our secret sentiments. I still remember too
well how Achmet, by calumniating me and my
neighbour Beni-Tamim to each other, was near
making the friends&mdash;the brothers of early youth&mdash;offer

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

each other in old age the cup of perdition!
But even with this example imprinted on my mind,
my heart rejects such a thought, and you shall witness
that we pay Suleiman the tribute of our herds,
not of our feelings."</p>

<p>"But why," said I&mdash;interrupting the Schaich's
harangue&mdash;"with such proofs of treachery on the
part of the Sultan's delegates, not prefer the security
of an open rupture to the dangers of a secret
enmity? Why not renounce at once all allegiance
to Suleiman?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Mansoor, "fate forbids my numbering
myself among those chiefs so entirely beyond
the Pasha's grasp, as to have nothing whatever to
fear from his resentment. My subjects live not all
yet in the portable tent; move not all yet from
place to place, free and unconstrained as the antelope.
Many of my vassals, fixed by the attraction
of a richer soil, have driven deep in the ground the
stakes on which rest their stationary huts, and,
like plants, adhere to the clod of earth which their
habitations compass. I myself, permitted for nine
months of the year to forget that Suleiman exists,
am obliged annually, during the three moons employed
in collecting the contributions on my more
distant tenants allured within his jurisdiction, to
refresh my remembrance of his being, and to pay
him my tithe of the monies I collect, and of the
homage I receive."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

<p>At the thoughts of these periodically returning
burthens of vassalage, a cloud seemed to overcast
the schaich's countenance. Its serenity, however,
soon returned, as, resuming his discourse, he added
with increased animation;&mdash;"but I too, with my
liability to incur wounds, possess my power to
sting. Not only for every injury done to my few
stationary tenants, can I retaliate tenfold on the
Pasha's wholly immoveable population: I can refuse
the escorts and the beasts of burthen, wanted
for the conveyance of his goods and the safety of
his pilgrims: I can, if his heavily armed troops
should venture into the desert, leave my battles to
be fought by thirst and by famine, by the stifling
sands and by the fearful simoom; I can commit to
the power of the elements the protection of Mansoor.&mdash;Therefore,
O stranger, since I now know
who you are, rest secure; and may soft slumbers
keep locked your already closing eyelids the remainder
of this night! To-morrow, in honour of
your coming, falls the fatted sheep."</p>

<p>There was nothing in this conversation with
Mansoor calculated to disturb the repose to which
I soon most willingly retired: accordingly, it lasted,
as little interrupted by irksome waking thoughts
as by troublesome dreams, until broad daylight.
My first care on getting up was to edify my host
by the unction of my morning prayer; my next
business to renew the evening's talk. I wanted
to bring him on the subject of the Wahhabees.

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

At first he rather hung back&mdash;apprehensive, no
doubt, of committing himself: but the respectful
terms in which I at all hazards mentioned
the new sect, induced him at last to become more
unreserved.</p>

<p>"Removed," said he, "as I am from the Ared,
and on the borders of Irak, any avowed union with
the sons of Wahhab would, in the present stage of
their progress, be of little advantage to them, and
of certain detriment to myself. It must draw upon
my head the wrath of Suleiman, without ensuring
me the support of Abd-ool-Azeez. Besides, a man
of my years wants repose during the few days God
still grants him to live,&mdash;were it only to prepare for
death; and when my earthly race shall be run, and
the domain of the Wahhabees shall have made nearer
approaches to my resting-place, it will then be for
my children to see in how far they may think it
expedient to join the standard of the new sectaries
more openly: but, though a sunnee in name, my
religious sentiments have, in reality, always claimed
kindred with those of Abd-ool-Wahhab. Bigotry
therefore raises not its insuperable barrier between
me and his followers, and when all other barriers
shall fall, and the opposite floods come near, they
must of their own accord run into each other."</p>

<p>The only thing which, after this candid confession
of Mansoor's sentiments, still prevented me
from disclosing without restraint my own designs,
was the presence of his youngest child,&mdash;a boy of

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

ten or twelve years of age, who, leaning against his
father, and alternately fixing his keen eye on whichever
of us spoke, seemed with out-stretched ears to
catch our words almost ere they fell from our lips,
and imbibed them as the thirsting plant drinks the
summer dews. "Might it not be well," whispered
I therefore to the schaich, "to send to his sports
this watchful lad, whose lips move not, but whose
mind devours all we say?"</p>

<p>"Does it?" cried Mansoor; "Ah! then by all
means let him stay:, let him attend to the converse
of men, that by so doing he may learn to become
one! Fear not his indiscretion: he has left the
women's chamber; like ourselves he has learnt to
fetter his tongue."&mdash;On such a commendation from
his parent a Greek boy would have spoken to assure
me of his silence; the young Arab only looked his
delight, in the bright glow which suffused his downy
cheek.</p>

<p>I now freely confessed to Mansoor that my destination
was Derayeh. "My acquaintance with
the plans and resources of the government of Bagdad,"
said I, "might be useful, and my wish to see
them marred, must at all events be acceptable."</p>

<p>Hereupon Mansoor ruminated a little:&mdash;at last,
"since such is your design," cried he, "I think I
may do a thing which will forward it, and be of
advantage to both. For some time past I have been

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

thinking of sending to Abd-ool-Azeez a token of
good-will. I shall avail myself of this opportunity.
The bearers of my offerings may be your guides
and escorts, and you, the bearer of my words of
amity."</p>

<p>This mission I most gladly accepted; and the
preparations were immediately begun. The difficulty
lay not in mustering the gifts:&mdash;they had
been long collected for the purpose. The most
prominent consisted of a handsome blood mare,
"able"&mdash;observed Mansoor&mdash;"though without
wings, to fly;" an abbah tissued with gold; some
rich Damascus blades, and some choice Persian
stuffs from the markets of Basra: but the spoke
in the wheel seemed to be the complimental epistle.
Mansoor's secretary was become a recording angel
in the regions above: Mansoor himself never had
shone as a penman; and, as to his vassals at present
in the camp, they were more remarkable for
wielding the reed whose point is steeped in blood,
than that whose end is dipped in ink. My whole
embassy was on the point of falling to the ground
for want of a scribe.</p>

<p>In this dilemma I bethought myself of my own
<i>savoir-faire</i>. It is true it extended not, in eastern
characters, beyond the most ordinary Nesh-khi sort.
For want however of a more skilful hand, I offered
mine, such as it was; not indeed to write in Arabic;&mdash;that

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

was out of all question,&mdash;but to indite an
epistle in Turkish.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation my services were accepted.
I was told the substance of what I was to pen, and
left to give it my own form. For this purpose I
retired to the most secluded corner of the tent, and
sat down to my work. Alas! I soon felt that neither
materials for writing, nor leisure to meditate,
could carry me through with the task which I had
so incautiously undertaken. The self-dubbed secretary
sat poring on his shining sheet of paper, like
a schoolboy at his theme, biting his nails, and not
knowing what to write. At last a bright thought
came to my relief. "Why not, where my Turkish
lore failed me, eke it out with Greek, and conceal
the scantiness of the substance under the exuberance
of the ornament?"</p>

<p>By this expedient the manuscript was at last completed,
and brought to the schaich. He looked it
over with an air of astonishment. "I do not," said
he,&mdash;twirling his turban round and round on his
head, and straining his eyes to make out a sentence,&mdash;"pretend 
to be conversant in Turkish writing;
but I have sometimes seen the penmanship of the
Divan, and certainly it never looked like this!"</p>

<p>"No more it could," I boldly answered. "People
in the north are constantly changing their fashions.
They now think it seemly in the Othoman chancery

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

to combine the Greek characters with the Persian
phraseology. But if this new mode displeases you,&mdash;give 
back the scrawl, and let me tear it."</p>

<p>"No, no," earnestly cried the old schaich, holding
my hand from executing the sentence. "The
letter has already cost us trouble enough. If it
should not be very intelligible, Allah-akbar: God
is great! my presents will explain its meaning."
So saying, he dipped his seal in ink, and impressed
it on the paper. It was then rolled up, inclosed in
a case sewed by Zeineb's own henna-tipped fingers,
and handed over to my care.</p>

<p>Meantime the fatted sheep was already smoking
in the platter. Invited to the feast, all the chiefs
of the camp flocked to the schaich's tent. An inferior
sort of self-invited guests followed. None
were refused that came; and each sating his appetite
in the order of his arrival, and then retiring
to make room for others, the tide of comers and
goers only ceased when the carcass was stripped to
the bone.</p>

<p>Now commenced the bustle of my departure. In
order to elude the hawk's eye of the roving free-booter,
I enveloped my Greek features after the
country fashion in a striped handkerchief, a gift of
the fair Zeineb. The horses were led out, and the
guides sallied forth.</p>

<p>"These trusty servants," cried Mansoor, "will

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

take you the shortest and safest road to my neighbour
the schaich (I think he said) of Shore&iuml;fath.
Coming as you do from me, he will receive you
well, and, when you leave him, will give you a fresh
escort. From camp to camp you will thus finally
reach Derayeh. Here and there, however, you will
find perilous passes. All the kabiles are not equally
friendly: some might be named with whom meeting
is fighting; and lately the combats have been so
sanguinary, that the private vengeance to be sated
on both sides leaves little hopes of a reconciliation.
Mind therefore every where to inquire, and always
to be prepared both for defence and flight. But
on this subject my friend Nasser, more advanced in
the desert than your servant, will give you more
pointed directions."&mdash;Then, taking me aside, and
charging me to inform Abd-ool-Azeez how well
disposed he was to his cause, but how ill situated
to show that disposition, except by his backwardness
in assisting Suleiman, the schaich held the stirrup
for me to mount, and bade me farewell. I set
forward just as the sun dropped behind the horizon,
and, followed by the Arabs, the led mare, and
the camels which carried the presents, slowly proceeded
on.</p>

<p>The month of March was just opening, and
the heat, save only at mid-day, still easily borne.
The verdant carpet of the desert, bruised by the
horses' hoofs, emitted at night its most aromatic

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

exhalations; and the plants and shrubs in full
bloom sent forth invisible clouds of the most powerful
perfumes. So deep appeared in the morning
the dye with which the scarlet anemone and purple
hyacinth enamelled the blushing plain unto the utmost
verge of the horizon, that the rosy tint of the
dawn only seemed their fainter reflection cast upon
the blue sky. Every where our cattle found abundant
pasture, and our own appetite feasted on milk
of an ambrosial flavour.</p>

<p>Two short days journey and a half, unclouded
by any danger or molestation, took us to Nasser's
camp. It is true that now and then, like a single
fleece in the azure sky, appeared far off in the
desert some solitary Bedoween, seeming to rove in
quest of plunder: but none came within hearing
distance, except one small party; and this, the moment
it recognised the Arabs of schaich Mansoor,
again quietly walked off, and vanished in space.</p>

<p>The same hospitality which had marked the reception
of Mansoor, shone pre-eminent in that of
Nasser. In him I even found, with less loquacity,
a more ready frankness. All within and around
him savoured stronger of the freedom of the desert.
The wife of Mansoor had only suffered herself to
be perceived: the consort of Nasser came forth,
and met our gaze undaunted. Not only she permitted
me to see her features unveiled, but she
very minutely scrutinised my own. A native of the

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

west was, I suppose, a novel sight to the lady: for
my person and my attire seemed equally to attract
her attention. Indeed her investigations became
by degrees so close, that, to my great relief, the
husband thought fit at last to interfere. I must
otherwise have been, by little and little, completely
undressed. Even after she had been compelled
reluctantly to retire, I heard the fair Farzane (or
whatever was her name) loudly complain to her
sympathizing maids, of the shackles imposed upon
her inquisitive spirit.</p>

<p>The attentions of the wife did not prevent the
husband from pressing me to stay beyond the time
I had limited; but it was done with that blended
warmth and discretion, which left me an entire
liberty to accept or to refuse. Indeed, combining
with the energy of the desert all the politeness of
the courtier, the schaich was like a rock covered
with flowers. Seeing me determined to proceed,
he gave me all the assistance in his power, and
advised me by means of a little circuit to avoid his
next neighbour, with whom he was on indifferent
terms; then, having supplied me with a double
provision of rice and dates and with an increased
escort, he wished me a prosperous journey, and
tarried at the entrance of his tent while I remained
in sight.</p>

<p>For the purpose of eluding as much as possible
all observation, I now travelled only at night. Before

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

the dawn arose, the body of the caravan used
to dive into one of those hollows which break the
surface of the Arab plain; while only one of its
members, lying down on the edge of the cavity,
stayed outside to keep watch. Thus we made way
but slowly, and only at the end of five days march
reached the encampment of schaich Amroo, chief
of a tribe bound by the strongest ties of reciprocal
services to that of Nasser. With this schaich, therefore,
I determined to tarry two whole nights; a resolution
for which I had to pay somewhat more than
the cost of my entertainment.</p>

<p>As the blood mare sent by Mansoor to Abd-ool-Azeez
had been declared on all hands perfectly
irresistible, nothing was omitted to assist human
weakness in withstanding her charms. No beauty
in a harem could be more strictly watched, both on
the road and at halting-places; where her conductor
never lay down to sleep, until he had tied round his
own waist one end of the chain of which the other
end fastened the legs of his charge: but even that
could not daunt the daring of an Arab&mdash;a stranger
in Amroo's camp, and only attracted by the report
of our arrival. Irresistibly smitten with the beauteous
mare, he had actually succeeded in severing
her fetters by means of a file, when, awakened by
some accidental noise, her keeper started up, and
caught the culprit in the fact.</p>

<p>The greater evil thus obviated, all that remained

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

to do was to prevent a lesser one still impending, by
extorting from the thief his right to shove the burthen
of the fine he had incurred on the shoulders
of some innocent bystander, whom he might succeed
to touch either with his person or his garment: and
for this purpose the bastinado was without delay
applied. Unfortunately, while every more wary
Arab kept carefully aloof during the operation, I
alone, attracted by my curiosity, and not knowing
my danger, must obtrude my person, on purpose
to meet the robber's skull-cap, thrown at me in the
midst of the infliction which he himself was suffering.
Hit by the villainous garment, I became in
honour bound to pay the wearer's ransom: but in
return for this good office I had the pleasure of
hearing him recount all his former achievements to
an admiring audience&mdash;delighted that I should so
providentially have prevented his brilliant career
from receiving a check. In short, if I had paid
dearly, I had liberated a hero. In the desert a
man's thefts are only called his gains.</p>

<p>On my next march we took such exceeding precautions
to avoid a particular horde of doubtful
character, that we walked right into the midst of it.
The encampment had moved to the very spot which
we supposed to be most safe from its intrusion, and
to arrive at which we had been tacking all the way.
A considerable sum was accordingly demanded of
us for leave to proceed. "You escort," said the

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

spokesman, "strangers whom we distrust, and you
carry goods which owe us a toll." This observation
suggested to me the idea of ascertaining the virtue
of my cipher, till then untried. "Let the chief
himself," cried I, "come forward, and state his
claims." This he presently did. Taking him by
the wrist, I whispered in his ear the Wahhab
watchword, and showed him the signet. At this
sight he looked scared, kept his eyes for some time
fixed on the awful talisman, and at last, waving his
hand, "pass on," he cried in surly disappointment,&mdash;and
immediately fell behind his grim and wondering
attendants.</p>

<p>This incident greatly enhanced my importance
among my own troop. Mansoor's Arabs now saw
very clearly that I was some great personage, respected
even in the heart of the desert; and they
paid me additional deference. It went not however
so far as to agree with me in an unqualified reprobation
of the fines levied by the Bedoween on the
passenger. "What the last schaich with whom we
fell in had attempted was certainly very wrong, but
what they themselves did was not the less perfectly
right. Because people allowed themselves the free
range of their own premises, was the door to be
thrown open unconditionally to every intruding
stranger? When the incautious traveller neglected
to make his bargain, to be sure he was mulcted;
sometimes even he was stripped to the skin: but

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

what then? were not those that undressed him the
descendants of Isma&iuml;l? Had not Isma&iuml;l been unjustly
disinherited by Ibrahim his father, and had
not the posterity of Isma&iuml;l an undoubted right to
seize upon its lawful inheritance, in whatever hands
it might have fallen?"&mdash;I attempted not to combat
this argument. All I did was inwardly to pray
that I might meet as few as possible of these disinherited
children.</p>

<p>The remainder of the journey only offered a tiresome
repetition of fatiguing marches and of tedious
halts; of wells missed in one place and found filled
up in another; of skirmishes and of flights. Our
reception in the different camps varied throughout
every intermediate degree between the most cordial
friendship, and positive fighting: and so uninterrupted
was the succession of expostulations, of
threats, and of protestations, that, ere we had
achieved half the way, my voice became almost extinct,
and I had to contend for my rights in dumb
show. Every tribe in whose vicinity we came supplied
our caravan with some new member, glad of
the opportunity to reach, under its protection, some
neighbouring district; and as those who joined us
constantly exceeded in number those that fell off,
our troop at last grew formidable enough to awe an
enemy of moderate strength. This was fortunate:
for the further we advanced, the greater became the
concupiscence excited by Mansoor's mares. Every

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

Arab on the road would gladly have given for them
wife, children, and friends.</p>

<p>Before the end of the journey we had to encounter
an enemy more formidable than any Arab tribe,
not excepting the most savage of the desert: I mean
the dread samiel. Our caravan was slowly pacing
through the boundless plain&mdash;the horses' steps
sounding more hollow than usual on the earth, and
a more awful stillness reigning in the atmosphere.
Suddenly a lurid glare overspread the eastern extremity
of the horizon, while a thick sulphureous
mist arose from the ground, which&mdash;first revolving
round and round in rapid eddies,&mdash;next mounted
up to the sky, and finally overcast with threatening
darkness the whole heavenly vault. At these terrific
symptoms our Arabs turned pale, and goaded on
our cattle with headlong hurry, in order, if possible,
still to outrun the baleful blast. But in vain!
Hoarsely murmuring, the hot stream swept the
ground with frightful speed, and, anxiously as we
quickened our pace, gained fast upon us. Perceiving
themselves encompassed on all sides by its fiery
breath, our people shrieked with terror, our very
cattle howled with instinctive anguish, and all that
had life fell flat on the ground, burying nose and
mouth deep in the shifting sands,&mdash;in hopes that
the envenomed current, gliding over the prostrate
limbs, might not approach the vitals.</p>

<p>Near half an hour did the raging hurricane keep

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

us thus riveted to the ground, without daring to
move, or to speak, or scarce to draw breath; and
soon entirely covered with a fine impalpable dust,
which not only penetrated into every fold of our
garments, but, as we afterwards found, into every
inmost recess of our boxes and luggage,&mdash;when at
last our beasts of burthen, as if awaking from a
profound trance, began to shake themselves, and,
by all again of one accord rising upon their legs,
gave the signal that the danger was past. Every
creature now stood up that was able, and thanked
Providence for his escape. Only one member of the
caravan, a foreign merchant,&mdash;too tardy perhaps in
prostrating himself before an unknown enemy,&mdash;rose
no more. On approaching, we already found
him breathless, and weltering in the black muddy
blood that gushed from his nose, mouth, and ears.
My guides lost no time in committing his corrupt
mass to the earth, ere the limbs should detach themselves
from the swelling trunk; then heaped some
stones over the spot, to protect it from the ounce
and jackall, and&mdash;these short rites and simple monument
completed&mdash;again proceeded onwards.</p>

<p>This catastrophe closed the adventures of the
desert. Soon after we began to descry before us,
like a cloud of a more benign and promising aspect,
the distant mountains of the Nedjd and the domain
of the Wahhabees; and with rapturous delight our
long procession by degrees entered verdant valleys

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

filled with date and lemon trees, intermixed with
towns and villages. After resting at Ramah, at
Makren, and in other places, equally inviting by
their situation and their produce, we at last reached
Derayeh, the capital.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner had my person, and Mansoor's presents,
been made fit to present themselves before
Abd-ool-Azeez, than I requested an audience in all
due diplomatic form. This was immediately granted.
It took place in the open air, at the gates of what I
must needs call&mdash;more from the dignity of its tenant
than its own&mdash;a palace; and the schaich received
me squatted on a rush mat. Notwithstanding his
advanced age of seventy-five, he still displayed good
features, and a handsome, though somewhat harsh
and forbidding countenance; and through all the
affected meanness of his dress, shone a lofty and
commanding air. I felt a sensation of awkwardness
at the richness of my own apparel, so much exceeding
that of the high personage whose favour I came
to seek. On this subject, however, I might have
spared myself any uneasiness. The schaich seemed
to contemplate my glitter&mdash;if noticed by him at all&mdash;with
perfect indifference; and when I presented
to him the gifts of Mansoor, he cast upon them the
careless survey of a man, who considers such things
as beneath his attention. The letter certainly puzzled

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

him: he seemed to feel as if it ought not to do
so, and he saved himself by his supercilious glance
the embarrassment of owning that he knew not what
to make of it. When at the conclusion of my harangue
I repeated to him the sentence, and showed
the signet, imparted to me by his emissary at Bagdad,
his brow unfurled, and his features relaxed
into a more affable expression. Still he remained,
after my speech was concluded, a few moments
musing and silent. At last: "Stranger," said he,
in a slow and deliberate manner; "wonder not if
an old warrior, accustomed to treachery and deceit,
should not feel immediate confidence in Mansoor's
protestations. If the light of truth has really penetrated
his heart, the Lord be thanked, especially by
himself, who must be the greatest gainer,&mdash;since the
choicest blessings of Heaven, both here and hereafter,
never fail to reward sincere conversion: but
I know the faith of Turks, and I distrust the very
Arab whose breath mingles often with theirs. Mansoor's
artful conduct may have deceived you, and it
is only on trial that I shall think myself secure
of his sincerity. The decisive hour," added he&mdash;suddenly
starting up from his seat&mdash;"is perhaps
not far off, when all who appear not on our side shall
be treated as if they had risen against us. The spears
already are pointing, and, at a distance beyond the
ken of other eyes, I already perceive the war dust

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

darken the sky. As to you, stay among us. In the
midst of my own children no treachery can reach
me; and I shall have pleasure in trying your talents."</p>

<p>I expressed my thanks; and fancying that the
schaich, during our conversation, had eyed my pistols
with peculiar complacency, resolved upon the
sacrifice of these showy weapons, to conciliate his
good will. Arabs of all ages are like children, and
always think most desirable the thing that is withheld
from them. Thence Abd-ool-Azeez showed
himself much more gratified with my pair of pistols,
than with all the rich presents of Mansoor. He immediately
directed that my expenses should be defrayed,
and, recommending his new guest to the care
of his attendants, mounted his horse and rode off,
followed by a numerous and motley suite.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he proceeded a dozen yards, when
just at the turning of the street he was met by a
young man also on horseback, arriving from the
country, and like himself attended by a considerable
retinue. The opinion which the stranger's air and
state gave me of his importance, was fully confirmed
by the reception which he met with from
the schaich of the Wahhabees. This chief&mdash;who
seemed not in general to waste his courtesies&mdash;immediately
turned back with the new comer, and when
both were dismounted, there commenced between
them a conflict of civilities, partly in speech and
partly in dumb show, which lasted several minutes.

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

Each repeated the same inquiries and the same protestations
a dozen times, and each touched a dozen
times the hand of the other. In the midst however
of this mutual assault of politeness, I still
thought I could discern in Abd-ool-Azeez's manner
a sort of conscious superiority; and the imposing reserve
which tempered his professions, formed a strong
contrast with the visible eagerness of tone and action
of the stranger. This latter, they told me, was the
schaich of a smaller kabile, connected with the chief
of the Wahhabees by the double tie of kindred and
of vassalage.</p>

<p>Presently the two personages sat down in the
court of the palace, and seemed preparing to discuss
an affair of importance. The fear of appearing
curious made me retire out of hearing&mdash;a ceremony
which seemed entirely waived by the rest of
the bystanders. The conference soon became animated.
Gesticulation, which is never spared among
the Arabs, rose higher and higher; opinions seemed
more and more to clash; and such at last became
the loudness of vociferation and the violence of
gesture, that, from expecting to see the two chiefs
devour each other with caresses, I now began to
apprehend the same result from very different preliminaries.
In the midst of my surmises, some
words which reached me where I stood, struck me
as relating to myself. I now accused my stupidity
in tarrying so long to guess the subject of the dispute.

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

The chiefs had met in perfect amity; they
had sat down to converse with the utmost good
humour; and the only subject of difference which
could have arisen must be <i>my</i> visit, <i>my</i> object, and
<i>my</i> merits. Nothing seemed so clear as that one
of the schaichs was my advocate, and the other my
enemy. At this discovery all my former discretion
forsook me, and, as the audience increased every
instant in numbers and in boisterousness, I resolved
to mix with the crowd, and to advance within hearing.
The first words which distinctly struck my
ear were&mdash;an unqualified sentence of death.</p>

<p>A thunder-bolt falling at my feet could not have
more astounded me. Had the measure been practicable
I would immediately have sought my safety
in flight. But fearful to betray my fear, and to
draw upon me the eyes of the multitude, by attempting
to force my way through their closely wedged
ranks, I was contented with making myself as small
as possible, in order to elude observation. With
a throbbing heart I continued to listen:&mdash;but my
palpitation prevented me from hearing another
word, and all I could do was to watch the looks of
the disputants. After the hawk's eye of Abd-ool-Azeez
had several times wandered round and round
the crowd as if seeking its prey, I at last saw it
pounce upon my features, and from that moment
remain steel fast. "It is all over with me now!"
thought I; and indeed an Arab to my right made

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

but too intelligible a sign to another on my left, that
no mercy must be expected. This confirmation
of my surmises had made me well nigh sink to the
ground, when a third Arab who stood before me,
shrugging up his shoulders, cried out; "his fate is
sealed;" and then with a deep sigh added: "alas!
poor Omar!"</p>

<p>Oh! how I felt relieved on hearing that death was
to be Omar's portion, not mine. My heart dilated,
my lungs expanded, and my blood again began
to flow. Ashamed of my silly apprehensions, I
stretched myself, resumed my erect posture, and
felt as if I rose the whole height of my head above
the surrounding multitude, on which I now cast all
round a leisurely and complacent look.</p>

<p>"Who is this Omar," said I to my neighbour,
"whose fate seems to excite such interest?"</p>

<p>"The boast of his tribe, the flower of his family,
and the pride of his parents," answered the man,&mdash;wiping
the tears from his face.</p>

<p>"And for these offences," resumed I, "doomed
to inevitable death?"</p>

<p>" 'Tis too certain," replied my informer. "His
liberality excited the envy of the ferocious Mooktar,
who, only intent upon tempting Providence by the
daily recension of his growing riches, never admitted
mortal man to partake of his goods. Wroth
that Omar, less wealthy, should yet be more respected,
he added outrage to jealousy, every where

<!-- vol 3 page 181 -->

insulted the object of his hatred, and even lifted his
lance against him; until at last Omar, in defence
of his own life, took the life of his foe. Hereupon,
lest Mooktar's powerful relations should sacrifice
justice to pride, he absconded, and his antagonist's
friends swore to revenge their slaughtered kinsman
on whatever friend of the homicide should come
within the reach of their spears. From this sanguinary
resolve they now in part desist. They
agree to accept a ransom for the lives of Omar's
kindred; but from their mercy Omar himself, of
course, remains excluded. If found, he still must
fall. Ibn-Aly, the strange schaich, himself related
to Omar, came in hopes of obtaining the youth's
inclusion in this compromise. He has just been
representing in the strongest terms to our chief&mdash;to
whom Mooktar owed vassalage&mdash;the intolerable
provocations on one side, and the long patience,
and at last, the unpremeditated retort, on the other:
but in vain! Even Abd-ool-Azeez cannot compel
Mooktar's friends to renounce the price of blood&mdash;the
right they have on Omar's life. Behold
them all ranged in a row behind our schaich,
hissing like scotched snakes: see the looks of rage
they dart on Omar's kinsmen ranged on the opposite
side behind their own chief Aly. Does it
not seem as if each troop were only waiting for the
signal to fall on the other like beasts of prey, mad
with the thirst for blood?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

<p>This account of my neighbour's was confirmed
by the words which Abd-ool-Azeez now uttered.
"Omar," said he, "has incurred capital punishment,
and, while he remains concealed, the sentence
cannot be mitigated. If he have any thing to allege
in his defence, let him come forward; let him
plead his own cause; let him submit, should he fail
in proving his innocence, to the wrath his crime
deserves.&mdash;In fine, let him seek the grant of his forfeited
life in the generosity of his adversaries, and
not in the impotence of their resentment."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied with a bitter smile the
strange schaich; "Omar is to be, by a false hope
of pardon, drawn out of his concealment, in order
that his enemies, spurning his defence, may at their
leisure riot in his destruction."</p>

<p>Abd-ool-Azeez gave the stranger a daunting look,
but coolly proceeded. "I doubt not," rejoined he,
"that the kinsmen of the deceased would pledge
themselves for the safety of the murderer, not only
while the pleading lasted, but until he were again
conducted beyond the pale of this district. What
say they?" exclaimed he, looking all round&mdash;as if
to invite the party concerned to confirm his supposition.</p>

<p>"We would, we would;" answered several voices
from among the cluster of Mooktar's relations; and
this was the first symptom, on their part, of a return
to feelings less implacable. But what became

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

the universal astonishment when, upon the
strength of these vague exclamations, a young man
of the most prepossessing appearance, after struggling
to break away from the followers of Aly, at
last was seen to spring forward, and to proclaim
himself the actually present Omar! Submitting
only to concealment in compliance with his friends'
desires, this noble-minded youth had impatiently
brooked the crouching attitude of fear and disguise.
He thought the circumstances of his case needed
only be known, to make his most implacable antagonists
own the guiltlessness of his conduct; and
the confused and tumultuous assent of some of
Mooktar's kinsmen to the proposal thrown out by
the supreme schaich, he had considered a challenge,
which his character no longer allowed him to disregard.
But Omar wholly trusted to the dictates of
justice: he had left out of his reckoning the suggestions
of passion. When the brothers of the deceased,&mdash;those
who most reluctantly had yielded
even to the partial compromise in favour of the innocent
friends of the guilty Omar,&mdash;saw darkening
the ground on which they stood, and defying their
anger while within reach of their poniards, the youth
himself whom they had so long and so fruitlessly
sought, they could not contain their fury. Drawing
the already sharpened dagger out of his bosom, the
eldest of the party sprung forward like a tiger upon

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

his unsuspecting prey, and plunged the shining
steel deep into Omar's side, ere the attendants of
the schaich had leisure to watch, or presence of
mind to arrest his heavy arm:&mdash;the blood spouted
from the wound upon its very author!</p>

<p>At this sight the prince sprang up; and, rending
his vestment: "Friends of Mooktar," he cried,
"what have you done? Under my own eyes, in
my very court, thus to break the faith just pledged,
to perjure yourselves, to set me at nought, and to
disgrace our whole tribe!&mdash;O Arab, Arab! Time,
while it lasts, never can wipe out this foul stain!"&mdash;and
he beat his naked breast.</p>

<p>"Our assent," answered, deeply blushing, the
almost breathless offender, "only rested on the
solemn assurance that none of the murderer's friends
knew what spot on earth was defiled by his presence:
you see, he mocked our wrath from the very midst
of their troop."</p>

<p>"And what of that!" resumed the schaich. "To
me you had committed the task of procuring you
justice; and all know whether I fulfilled my trust.
Speak, foes of Omar, as well as his friends, if I
showed any undue partiality. But you have infringed
your promise; you have trodden upon your
engagement; and if Omar dies, murder has been
requited by equal murder. Your own blood will
have to atone for the blood which you spilt."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

<p>These words were heard by Omar. Weak as
he was, and expecting his wound to prove mortal,
yet could he not brook to rest the fairness of his
own character merely on the foul deed of his adversaries.
He insisted on making the defence
which before had been granted him, and proving
his entire innocence. The schaich gave the requisite
permission, and, in order that his almost extinct
voice might be heard, immediately imposed on all
around him the strictest silence.</p>

<p>Supported by two of his nearest relations, Omar
now advanced, and in words few and faint, but
most clear and impressive, stated the manifold insults
he had received, and the daily forbearance he
had shown, until provocations baffling all human
patience had extorted the chastisement, which even
then had not been intended to end in Mooktar's
death. Few were those among Omar's hearers who,
when he concluded his speech, pronounced him not
in their hearts far more than merely acquitted:&mdash;worthy
of applause, of reward, of every honour.</p>

<p>But among those was not the supreme schaich.
Whether prompted by extreme love of justice, or
by a latent bias toward his own tribe: "Omar,"
exclaimed he, to the dismay of all;&mdash;"you have
chosen to rest your safety on the merits of your
case, and have compelled me to sit in judgment on
one whom I could have wished to save. I own you
deserving of pity, but I cannot pronounce you entitled

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

to pardon. That word may not pass my
lips."</p>

<p>Then, turning to the kinsmen of Mooktar:
"Friends of the slain," continued he, "I am going
to deliver into your hands that which, though in
part too hastily anticipated, yet in its whole is your
due. I am going to give you full possession of your
victim. If, not satisfied with having drawn blood
for blood, you must have the entire certainty of
taking life for life, achieve your work of vengeance;
plunge deeper your daggers into the heart of Omar;
and secure yourselves against any remaining possibility
of his surviving his wound, and boasting of
his deed."</p>

<p>At these cruel words, Omar, exhausted with
agitation and with loss of blood, fell senseless on the
pavement; his friends uttered mournful groans,
and the leader of his enemies having whetted his
knife on the steps of the palace, stooped to perform
the last act of revenge, by plunging his poniard to
the heart of the already speechless youth:&mdash;when
Abd-ool-Azeez, yet holding back his hand, in a
louder voice continued:</p>

<p>"Having thus," said he, "performed my duty
both as arbitrator and as judge; let me however
add this one thing more, that the act I am forced to
permit must perpetuate between two distinguished
families the rancour just kindled, and doom their
enmity only to end in the destruction of the tribes to

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

which they belong. I therefore denounce, as ruler
of these realms, as minister of the Most High, and
as apostle of the only pure faith, on whoever shall
draw down upon his country an evil of such magnitude,
my eternal malediction. Cursed be the hand
that shall advance to extinguish the embers, of an
already fleeting life; cursed the lip that shall from
an already agonised enemy withhold a free and unqualified
forgiveness!"</p>

<p>"Yes; cursed be that hand, and cursed be those
lips!" now re-echoed in unison from all the beholders&mdash;save
one, who himself however, as if already
struck by the anathema, and no longer daring to
oppose the universal impulse, now with a ghastly
look and quivering lip faintly uttered: "take my
pardon;" then overwhelmed with disappointment
and rage, fell back among his troop,&mdash;and disappeared.</p>

<p>Shouts of joy now arose from every quarter. Of
the dead Mooktar all further thoughts were dismissed,
and the still breathing Omar alone continued
the object of general solicitude. Abd-ool-Azeez
assigned him a small abode near the palace;
and thither the youth was carried on the shoulders
of his friends, but with little hopes of saving his life.
In honour of the reconciliation between the two
families the supreme chief ordered a sumptuous
feast. While the banquet was preparing he presented
me to his kinsman. "This stranger," said he, "is

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

come to bend the knee with us to the Most High
in the rightful worship. He abandons the luxuries
of the Turks for the frugal life of the Wahhabees,
and brings with him the sciences taught in cities,
that they may fructify in our camps." Then, turning
to me:&mdash;"the Othomans," added he, "boast
of having once conquered these regions. Their
armies crossed them indeed&mdash;but as the arrow
cleaves the air, without leaving a trace. The Wahhabees
soon shall march through the land of the
Turks: but they shall go as the plough goes through
the ground,&mdash;cutting up all it meets in its way, and
leaving behind it an indelible track. In vain, to
conceal his wrinkles, old Suleiman paints his careworn
face: at the bare sound of our name the paleness
of fear overcasts all his features, and proclaims
the true feelings of his bosom through the lying
crimson that glows on his cheek!"</p>

<p>The repast being ready, the various groups of
guests sat down round the loaded platters, according
to their rank. Mine, being that of a foreign
ambassador, procured me the honour of a place
near the schaichs. Scarce had I, according to the
country fashion, thrust my fingers in the dish,
when an Arab, so enveloped in his ha&iuml;ck that his
figure was not more cognizable than his face, walked
into the room, with great solemnity approached the
place where I sat, put the hem of my garment to
his lips, and his lips to my ear, and in a whisper interrupted

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

by loud and frequent sobs, invited me to
leave my dinner, and to go where he should precede
me. He most obstinately indeed refused to explain
who he was, and for what purpose he desired my
company, but there appeared something so earnest
and impressive in his manner, that I could not say
nay; and though my neighbours pressed me to stay,
and loudly inveighed against the unmannerly Arab
who called a new comer away from the feast at its
very beginning, I followed my mysterious herald,
and bade him lead the way.</p>

<p>Contenting himself with thanking me for yielding
to his entreaty, by a silent but earnest pressure of
the hand, he conducted me to a hovel at the bottom
of a narrow lane. There, gently opening the door
of a back room, into which he preceded me on tiptoe,
he ushered me amongst a large assembly of
persons of both sexes, so intent upon the object
around which they were collected, that he was
obliged to push them aside in order to show me
where lay, on a species of litter, wan, pale, and
seeming at the last gasp, the wounded Omar.</p>

<p>The party, assembled round this poor youth,
were his parents and relations, who, when Ibn-Aly
his cousin set out for Derayeh to negotiate his
safety, had not been able to prevent him&mdash;impatient
as he felt under the imputation of cowardice&mdash;from
following, mixed among his kinsman's suite; and
had therefore in their turn also followed, in order

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

if possible to check his impetuosity, or at least to
support his valour:&mdash;a circumstance which enabled
them, after the imprudence he committed, immediately
to come forward to his assistance, and to
afford him all the care his situation required.
Though his wound seemed not to have reached
the vital parts, yet had Mooktar's dagger gone
deep in his breast, and a high fever and extreme
debility rendered his state to all appearances so
critical, that his friends felt the utmost apprehension
for his life. Hearing that a stranger had
arrived at Derayeh, skilled in the knowledge of the
west, they determined to request his advice; and it
was the father&mdash;the afflicted Beder himself&mdash;who
came for me to the palace. The fear of marring
the hilarity of the feast by the sadness of his looks
had made him conceal his face, and the dread of
incurring the reproaches of the host for taking
away his guest had induced him to keep closed his
lips. Even now that, out of hearing of the mirthful
board and arrived with me near the bed of sickness,
he attempted to speak, he could only point in
silence to his son, lying almost insensible on his
couch&mdash;and moved his lips in vain to request my
assistance. No sound came, and the tears which
mechanically trickled down his cheeks belied the look
of composure forced upon his struggling features. As
to his wife and daughters, they attempted not even
to suppress their emotion. Casting away all Mussulman

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

reserve, they convulsively grasped my hand,
covered it with kisses, and bathed it in tears.
"Cure, ah cure our loved Omar!" they cried
with heart-rending moans; "for we know that it is
in your power."</p>

<p>This supposition was rather appalling; and the
first thing I did was to disclaim every pretension to
infallibility.</p>

<p>After that protest, which, however seriously uttered,
met with but little credence, I walked up to
the patient, and, surrounded by an immoveable and
breathless circle, endeavoured to ascertain Omar's
condition. The chief medicine which on due investigation
his case seemed to require, was bodily
rest and mental composure.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I therefore to the father, whose breath
seemed suspended while I spoke, but whose eyes devoured
my words, "the character in which I come to
this country is that of envoy of schaich Mansoor,
not of disciple of Ibn-Senna. What little skill in
medicine I may possess was acquired as an object
of curiosity, not as a means of profit. The gratuitousness
of my assistance entitles me to stipulate
before hand for the most implicit obedience to all
my prescriptions."</p>

<p>"Order us to wrest from Aly's tomb his plumed
turban," hereupon cried the father. "Command
us to crawl on our bare knees to the Kaaba," exclaimed
the mother. "Bid us renounce all the

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

honours of the married state," spoke, in faltering
accents, the daughters.</p>

<p>"All these," I observed, "would be very difficult
achievements, but of very little efficacy as a cure.
A much easier proceeding might be of infinitely
more advantage: namely, for the relations not to
keep the patient in a constant fever by their alarms
and their surmises; but to retire, to stay without the
room, and not to re-enter it, except with my permission."</p>

<p>This prescription, however, was in itself much
too easily obeyed, to have a chance of being enforced
without the utmost difficulty. Nothing but the absolute
certainty of losing their son, with which
they were threatened, unless it were adhered to,
could make the good people clear the chamber, and
commit their dearest treasure to my sole unwatched
care.</p>

<p>Left alone with my patient, I in a careless way
mixed up a draught, and with an air of important
solemnity composed a charm; pledged myself only
for the efficacy of the amulet, but took care to see the
potion drunk off to the last drop. The confidence
in the spell, the composing nature of the medicine,
and the quiet of the room, procured the youth a
refreshing sleep, and when he awoke, he found his
fever abated and his strength recruited. I now
dressed his wound, gave him some liquid food, and,
calling in his friends, showed them the improvement

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

in his looks. But so loud were their exclamations
of joy, and so boisterous the blessings they bestowed
on my ancestors for three generations back, that I
soon turned them all out again. My part of Cerberus
was unremittingly supported, until long intervals
of tranquillity, and visits of an instant only,
had removed all danger. When, owing to his good
constitution, the youth became visibly convalescent,
I stepped modestly forward to receive the thanks
due to nature, for preserving the hopes of a powerful
house;&mdash;and these were not withheld. Had I
saved Omar only through dint of the most consummate
skill and the most unwearied toil, the expressions
of gratitude could not have been more
ardent or more sincere.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Abd-ool-Azeez</span> had provided me at Derayeh
with a lodging such as became a guest of my distinction.
In fair weather it let in no rain, and in
foul it stopped not the water from running out. My
meals, which came ready dressed from the schaich's
own kitchen, had at least one great merit; that of
affording little excitement to intemperance. Now
and then there arrived in single state, before or after
my dinner, a plate of sweetmeats or a bowl of hoshab,
as a more pointed mark of attention,&mdash;on
which occasions I failed not to be in all the requisite
ecstacies. The strictness of the Wahhabee tenets
forbade my being entertained with bands of singers
and dancers; but one might have fancied that I
was expected myself to perform for the amusement
of the curious, from the number that attended my
levee every morning, ere I went out to pay my own
court to the prince, or to visit my patient. With
the schaich I used to talk of Suleiman, of his force,
his policy, the intrigues of those who usurped his
authority, and the cabals of those who coveted his
succession. With Omar I used to handle a topic
to me still more interesting: my own dear self. I

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

related to him every extraordinary object I had
seen, and every strange adventure I had experienced.</p>

<p>No one could help loving the young Bedoween.
Combining gentleness with spirit, and modesty with
noble pride, his mind displayed in the midst of the
desert, the cultivation of the college and the graces
of a court. While lying on his bed of sickness he
would make me hour after hour continue my narrations,
though they often drew a deep sigh from his
bosom; and, when my breath was exhausted, he
would in his turn take up the discourse, and relate
the history of his tribe and the vicissitudes of his
family. What he loved most to expatiate upon,
was the purity of his blood and the virtues of his
parents: his eyes glistened on telling me how his
father&mdash;abhorring the frequent divorces in vogue
among the Arabs, and the sacrifice they made of
lasting affections to transient enjoyments&mdash;had never
had any wife but his mother; and how he himself
proposed to follow his sire's good example. So exalted
were his sentiments and so pleasing his conversation,
that, when I shut my eyes, I sometimes
could fancy I heard my friend Spiridion. Externals
only differed; their hearts wore the same hue.
Indeed, what all the sublime moral precepts of the
young Greek, urged expressly for my benefit, could
not effect, the simple expression of noble sentiments
which dropped unintentionally from the artless

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

Arab, in great measure brought about:&mdash;they operated
a real and important change in my own disposition,&mdash;for
my heart was now softened by sorrow,
and steadied by experience: and poets say that the
clay must be moistened by the dews from heaven,
ere it can imbibe the fragrance of the neighbouring
rose.</p>

<p>What wonder then that the constant interchange
between us, of varied information on my part, and
of valuable principles on that of my patient, should
by degrees have cemented between us a sincere and
tender friendship. It acquired such intensity that,
after the period had been fixed for Omar's return
to El-Gaddeh, the place of his residence, he found
means to linger at Derayeh some time longer on
the score of debility, in order to put off the evil
day of our separation; and when he no longer could
urge any new excuse for staying, he made it his last
solemn request, on taking leave of the great schaich,
that I might be permitted to accompany him to his
home, and to stay under his roof. This favour the
prince was prevailed upon, after some demur, to
grant; but only for a limited period, and on the
express condition that I should hold myself in readiness
to return to Derayeh the moment I was
summoned.</p>

<p>At El-Gaddeh and in Beder's abode, I need not
say that I felt more at ease than I had done at
Derayeh, fed from the prince's own kitchen. My

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

kind hosts treated me to every diversion which the
country afforded. Sometimes we went out hunting,
at others we witnessed sports of agility and strength;
and on the days we passed at home, Omar used to
collect all the poets and story tellers of the country,
to pay me compliments more grateful than merited.
According to the accounts of these veracious gentlemen,
I might trace my descent at my pleasure either
from the Genii or the Peris; and as to my achievements,&mdash;the
thousands which Antar slew every
morning before breakfast, without a hair on his
head being hurt, were child's play in comparison.
Omar's relations and friends behaved to me as if all
these fictions were fact: his father seemed to rejoice
in our growing attachment, and Ibn-Aly himself,
the head of the family as well as of the tribe, paid
me every most flattering attention. Strange to tell,
but true; the place where in the course of my
chequered life I experienced most of that glowing
kindness which springs from the heart, was that
where I sat down the greatest stranger, and which,
in point of geographical situation, lay furthest removed
from the land of my birth.</p>

<p>I yet only reckoned the length of my stay at
El-Gaddeh by single days, when one evening, returning
with Omar from a camp pitched on the
skirts of the desert, the youth suddenly stopped
to contemplate the setting sun. After some time
watching its decline with a pensive air; "Selim,"

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

said he,&mdash;pointing to that part of the horizon
where its broad disk was rapidly gliding behind the
earthly globe,&mdash;"your heart, I fear, still lingers
there. Do what we may, some day we shall see
you take up your staff, and bend back your steps to
the regions of the west."</p>

<p>"Omar," answered I, "<i>there</i> certainly arose the
first affections of my youth; in those regions were
knit the strongest ties that bind my soul. It seems
as if there alone my autumn could enjoy its second
spring."&mdash;And though this speech might seem only
framed for the occasion, and intended to enhance
the merit of my stay, it had begun to be the language
of truth. When I thought of my no longer existing
Euphrosyne; of my still&mdash;as I hoped&mdash;breathing
Alexis, and of my ever faithful friend Spiridion,
tears of tenderness started in my eye, and the longing
to return to the soil which had been blessed by
their shadow, made my heart swell in reality with
ill suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>"Ah!" rejoined Omar, "why cannot we offer
you, among us, ties strong as those that draw you
away! I wished my Selim to marry one of my
sisters, in order that our blood might be mixed;
that you might strike root in our soil. O that my
parents, who so dote upon the preserver of their
son, would for once sacrifice the pride of their race
to the promptings of their gratitude and the dictates
of their love!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

<p>"Sir," replied I, somewhat nettled, "supposing
your parents wished for the alliance, know you that
I can accept it? I told you before that I once was
married: I told you that I had had for my wife the
daughter of a Bey of Egypt: I have since sworn
never to plight my vows again. Inform your
parents of this engagement, in order that they may
be troubled on my account neither with scruples
nor with fears. To free them from all restraint
and to rid them of all uneasiness, I shall soon return
to Derayeh. Indeed I am to blame&mdash;in my
situation&mdash;thus to stay away from the great schaich,
to whom my employers sent me."</p>

<p>"Forgive the unintentional offence," resumed
Omar, covering his eyes with his hand: "I could
mean no reflection on your birth. The genuine
Arab thinks the purity of his pedigree sullied even
by mixture with the Tartar blood of the Sultans,&mdash;who
probably would with equal care shun the taint
of the Arab race. These are man's follies in every
quarter of the globe!"</p>

<p>An effort now was made to turn the conversation
to other topics;&mdash;but with little success. Constrained
while it lasted, it soon languished, and
finally died away. Omar, so far from appearing
relieved by the indifference which I expressed to
the prejudices of his friends, would rather have
seen me anxious to overcome their objections. He
regretted my lukewarm desire for a permanent

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

connexion with his house; and from the day of this
excursion a despondency came over him, which,
having its source in the mind, baffled every power
of medicine.</p>

<p>Finding I could afford my friend little solace by
my stay, and was wasting my time at El-Gaddeh,
I seriously prepared to make good my words, and
return to Derayeh. The hour was already fixed
for my departure, when Ibn-Aly sent to speak with
me.</p>

<p>"Selim," said he, as soon as we were alone,
"you have now associated with us long enough to
know our customs and our disposition. See whether
you could like for ever to turn away from the
west, and to sit down among our tribes, so you were
made a sharer in all their prerogatives,&mdash;so you
were given a wife from that house in which you
already have gained so many friends. I must not
conceal from you that my kinsmen have brought
their minds to this proposal only after a considerable
struggle. Rarely we marry out of our district,
more rarely still out of our country: but such is
the love we bear Omar, and such the fear which his
languor inspires us with of losing him, that for his
sake we not only permit, we ardently desire an
union, which may fix you for ever in the land of
the Wahhabees. Nor need you fear that objections,
wholly unconnected with your person, when once
removed, will leave roots from which to spring up

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

afresh. Once adopted as the son of my friends,
you may to the end of your days rely upon their
support and affection."</p>

<p>Had an alliance with the children of Wahhab
never been proposed to me, I should probably have
regarded it as a thing from which my mind must,
in its present state, have utterly recoiled. I had
originally sought the Wahhabees only in order to
fly from Suleiman, and I had since only prolonged
my stay with them, because I could nowhere else expect
so hospitable a reception: but, though resigned
to live a while in Arabia, it was not among Arabs
that I wished to die. Unfortunately, after people so
proud as these lords of the desert had overcome
their own overweening scruples, it became expedient
for me to conquer my more reasonable reluctance
and to accept the connexion, or to quit the abode of
those by whom it was tendered. I could not tarry
where I had refused what was offered with so great
an effort, and was considered as so signal an honour.
I therefore resolved to sacrifice my feelings to my
situation; but, still apprehensive of diminishing my
importance by too ready an acceptance of an offer
unwillingly made, I appeared yet a while to hang
back, and again alleged my vow to Ibn-Aly, as I had
done before to Omar. <i>That</i> circumstance however
was not admitted to have any weight but what my
own inclination gave it. No oath, taken during my
state of darkness, could remain binding after my
eyes were opened to the true light; and, on Ibn-Aly

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

assuring me very solemnly that the Wahhabee
was only held to perform what the Wahhabee had
promised, I yielded at last to so powerful an argument.
The sanction of the grand schaich however
was deemed necessary, before a marriage so greatly
out of the common rule could be concluded: it was
asked, and, after some little hesitation, obtained.</p>

<p>Among sisters all equally straight, of whose faces
I had scarce had a glimpse during their brother's
danger at Derayeh, and whose voices I had seldom
heard since their return to El-Gaddeh, I harboured
no preference, and therefore submitted implicitly to
the choice of my friends: it fell upon the eldest,
who still remained unmarried;&mdash;a maiden no longer
reckoned quite in her prime, as she had attained
the mature age of fifteen. The reason of her continuing
so unusual a time a barren plant in so prolific
a soil, was not however the want either of inclination
to take a husband, or of charms to attract
one. It arose from the untimely death of two
young men, both of distinguished rank, to whom
she had been successively betrothed. The one fell
in battle, the other was cut off by a fever; and
perhaps the idea of some fatality attached to her
name had since kept off other suitors. I felt no
superstition on that score, and was as well pleased
with the fair one chosen for me as I would have
been with any other female of the family. No
sooner had the union obtained Abd-ool-Azeez's consent,
than, for fear I suppose lest the new suitor

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

should again slip through the noose, the wedding
day was fixed at a very early period.</p>

<p>All my remaining cash was employed in fitting
out my future spouse with necklaces and bracelets,
ear, nose, wrist, finger, ankle and toe rings,&mdash;which,
though a Wahhabee, I found that, as a woman, my
bride could endure. The presents which in my turn
I received from her parents and friends, were of a
more useful description: a fine horse completely
equipped with mace, lance, and carbine; a commodious
goat skin tent, with its apartment to the right
and left; a Persian carpet; a handsome sofa case,
and a variety of household articles. My friend
Omar, anxious to see me in every respect on a
par with the proudest of his house, supplied whatever
others might omit. I except pipes and chaplets:
Wahhabees neither smoke nor count their
beads.</p>

<p>The very last items of the <i>menage</i> of which I was
permitted to make an inventory, were, as usual, the
charms of my bride. When, however, after running
with every demonstration of terror and dismay
from house to house&mdash;as is deemed an indispensable
act of decorum on these occasions&mdash;she at last suffered
herself to be caught by her more nimble
companions, and was brought by force to her expectant
bridegroom, I could not help thinking that
others, more worth pursuing, had come more
readily; and found nothing to drive from my mind
the deep sunk image of my Euphrosyne. The

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

circumstance produced a relief to my feelings rather
than a disappointment to my taste. Had A&iuml;sch&eacute;
been so superlatively handsome as to fan into a
fresh blaze the embers of my heart, I should have
felt as if committing an infidelity to the memory of
her whom I could now only honour by unavailing
regrets. Not that the sister of Omar must positively
be called plain. The sun indeed might have
found little to spoil in her complexion, had it been
allowed freely to shine upon her person: but with
teeth as white as ivory and eyes and hair as black
as jet, she had a countenance which, like Omar's,
beamed with sweetness, and the Arabs all declared
that her limbs resembled the branches of the date
tree waving in the north-east wind, which only
meant, that she moved very gracefully. Her features,
besides, were regular, and the least touch of
those cosmetics, so plentifully used by our artful
Chiotes, would have enabled her in a civilised
country to pass for a positive beauty, or at least for
a very captivating brunette,&mdash;had she not most
perversely destroyed her chance for ever, by having
every prominent part of her face, neck and arms,
indelibly sprigged over in marks of gunpowder,
after the most approved pattern.</p>

<p>Her mind, like her person, resembled that of her
brother. With every amiable quality, it retained
all that diffidence of its own worth, which those
are the oftenest unincumbered with, who ought to
feel it the most. In its overflowings of love and of

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

confidence, I learnt what even Omar had carefully
kept from my knowledge; namely that, while employed
at Derayeh in curing the wound of the brother,
I had unconsciously transfixed with Cupid's
darts the tender heart of the sister. Her secret
passion had, perhaps, contributed as much as the
professed friendship of Omar, to determine the
parents in favour of the union. The solicitude of
these worthy people in behalf of their children remained
not unrewarded;&mdash;the son and the daughter,
each obtaining the long sought object of their
wishes, each seemed to acquire new health and new
spirits.</p>

<p>But if the bud, which had pined for want of the
refreshing dews from heaven, now revived, it revived
only to become the sport of storms and whirlwinds:
for, where ardent love is sought and given, calm
esteem soon is construed into absolute aversion,&mdash;and
that crime tarried not to be laid to my charge.
At first indeed A&iuml;sch&eacute; sought the cause only in
herself. "Alas!" cried she, "how should a poor
Bedoween girl be able to fix those affections, on
which have been lavished all the fascinations of the
women of the cities! Nature has not given me their
charms, nor education their art. I have only my
poor simple love with which to retain love; and
they say that the more of its ardours are bestowed,
the fewer are obtained in return:"&mdash;but by degrees
my restless spouse began to render an imaginary

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

fickleness in her poor husband responsible for her
disappointments. In a country where the heart resembles
a volcano whose eruptions never cease, the
fire in my bosom could not be supposed so entirely
to slumber, and superior attractions abroad were
regarded as the cause of my insufficient warmth at
home.</p>

<p>No protestations I made could remove this idea:
no behaviour natural or assumed could quiet these
tenderly cherished fears. My actions, my gestures,
my very looks&mdash;ever watched, ever weighed, and
ever found wanting&mdash;were ever considered as confirming
my treason. The most opposite conduct
incurred the same sinister interpretations, A&iuml;sch&eacute;
was always ready to believe without proof what she
dreaded without reason. Her ingenuity had no
employment but to establish my imaginary crimes,
and to build upon them her real unhappiness. Did
her unfounded jealousies complete the depression of
my spirits, "she saw how matters stood: her person
no longer possessed the smallest power to please;
her love could not afford me the least solace; her
very company was become to me a burthen!" Did,
on the contrary, in spite of her unceasing anxiety,
a momentary glimpse of cheerfulness unfurrow my
brow, "she wondered at the sudden change; she
tried to find out what success abroad could extend
its influence to my very home!" The most insidious
scrutiny was my constant welcome; and, after succeeding

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

to perplex me completely by questions, the
answers to which,&mdash;however differently framed&mdash;ever
led to the same predetermined conclusions,
A&iuml;sch&eacute; was always sure to found upon the very embarrassment
caused by her unjust surmises, their
undeniable confirmation,&mdash;until at last I no longer
knew how to act or to look, ever had in her presence
an air of constraint, concealed from her my most
innocent actions as if disgraceful or culpable, and,
thanks to her own unremitting labour, with a clear
conscience always wore a face of guilt.</p>

<p>The brother, with whom I spent every hour of
my absence from the sister, at last succeeded by his
representations to remove in a certain degree my
consort's suspicions of my unimpeachable fidelity.
Who would not have thought every point of repose
and comfort carried by this change? Not at all!
Tender minds must have their grievances:&mdash;they
are to them food and raiment. It was a worse
symptom that nothing could attach me: it showed a
total disgust of the country; it increased the danger
of losing me altogether. From only fearing I might
withdraw from her arms, A&iuml;sch&eacute; now began to
tremble lest some day I should entirely abandon her
home, her country and her friends. The moment
she saw me at all thoughtful, she was sure I meditated
nothing less than to make my escape, and to
return to the land of my fathers. It was useless to
deny the charge: the stronger the protestations I
made, the closer A&iuml;sch&eacute; seemed to cling to her

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

chimera. "Speak not; utter not a syllable; give
me no assurance," she would cry in her agitation:
"I know you Osmanlees abhor truth. If you
pledge not your word, if you waste not your faith
in empty vows, you may perhaps continue to love
me, to stay with me, to press me to your bosom a
little while longer; but if you make a promise, if
you take an oath, I am undone at once. The promise,
only made to be broken, the oath, only taken
for the sake of the perjury, will goad you on the
faster to my destruction; and you will have no rest
till I am become a deserted, forsaken, widowed
wretch!" And hereupon she would sometimes clasp
her hands round my neck, imploring that before I
abandoned her I would plunge my dagger to her
heart, lest she should survive my loss. At other
times she would throw herself on the ground, and
with loud wailings tear her hair and beat her breast,
as if my desertion had already come to pass.</p>

<p>Earlier in life I should only have felt the impatience
produced by these unfounded apprehensions.
I now also considered the principle whence they
arose, and forgave the effect in view of the cause.
By degrees gratitude for that cause even grew into
sincere affection; and, could I for a moment have
forgotten Euphrosyne, it might have ended in a
return of still more ardent feelings; but love&mdash;such
as woman delights in&mdash;was no longer to be felt by
Anastasius for the living!</p>

<p>Stern war itself had lost in my eyes much of its

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

wonted charms;&mdash;and very fortunately, as matters
stood. Somewhat more singed than usual by its
ardour in returning their last addresses, the Wahhabees,
though not sufficiently scorched to stay
quietly at home, yet felt not disposed this season to
seek its chances at an inconvenient distance. While
some of the yet unsubdued kabiles of Montefih and
Beni-Haled were making nearer approaches than
they had done of late years to the domain of
Abd-ool-Azeez, that portion of the schaich's own
subjects whose chief residence was in towns and
villages showed greater dilatoriness than usual in
leading their flocks into the desert for pasture. It
was even doubted a while whether Ibn-Sehood,
Abd-ool-Azeez's eldest son&mdash;to whom his father
had for some years past, on account of his own great
age, intrusted the conduct of his warlike expeditions&mdash;would
go into camp at all; and there seemed at
one moment no chance whatever of my beholding
the stopping of the least caravan, or the plundering
of the smallest sanctuary, in honour of God;&mdash;when
all at once the whole nation, men, women, and
children, sallied forth from their stationary habitations,
to pitch their tents in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Each tribe had its separate camp, at the distance
of a league or two from its nearest neighbours. In
each camp the tent of the chief occupied the central
spot: round him the members of his own family
formed the innermost circle: and round these again

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

his remoter vassals and subjects ranged themselves
in circles still concentric but of wider circumference,
whose relative distance marked their respective ranks
and possessions.</p>

<p>Ibn-Sehood's encampment of course was the most
considerable. To that, as to head-quarters, was sent
from all the smaller and remoter camps constant intelligence
of every interesting occurrence in their
immediate vicinity. <i>There</i> also the schaichs of the
minor divisions met, to hold council with the commander
on the general plan of the campaign, and to
receive his instructions respecting its conduct. Ibn-Sehood's
camp was the capital for action, as Derayeh
was that for repose.</p>

<p>The assemblage of tents among which stood my
own, professedly bore a warlike form, and had a
warlike destination; yet it must be owned that slight
were the shades of difference between the Bedoween's
most martial array, and their most peaceful
establishment. Even in times of the profoundest
peace the Arab of the desert lives in camps, constantly
moving from place to place, and ready alike
for attack and for defence; and during the periods
of the most active warfare the combatants still only
advance and retreat surrounded by their families,
and as solicitous to feed their flocks as to fight their
enemies. On ordinary occasions each subordinate
schaich, at the head of his immediate subjects, halts,
moves on, attacks or flies as his individual fancy or

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

judgment prompts him; dreams not of acting in
concert with his brother schaichs, and evinces no
sort of attention to the movements of the chief ruler.
It is only when the commander of the whole nation
purposes some definite expedition or coup-de-main
of great importance and short duration, that all the
lesser schaichs and their vassals close in round his
standard. Nor do they then even consider themselves
as engaged to assist him longer than suits
their own convenience. As soon as they become
tired of the service, or find the plunder short of
their expectations,&mdash;without asking leave of the
commander, or waiting the end of the campaign&mdash;they
quietly secede, and return to their own peculiar
district. The voice of fanaticism, the interests of
religion may at times excite to the most daring and
perilous enterprises; but they fail to enforce a patient
and persevering discipline; and nothing do
the Wahhab tribes so much resemble in their mode
of warfare as those swarms of devouring locusts, offspring
of the same country, who appear in hostile
form when least expected; according as the wind
sets one way or another fall on this field or on that;
and, when all is devoured, again rise, fly elsewhere,&mdash;and
nowhere leave the marks of a permanent
possession.</p>

<p>Some of the Wahhab divisions more to the westward
had, very soon after encamping, the happiness
to be engaged in skirmishes with the children of

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

Beni-Haled. Our camp was left in a state of inactivity
somewhat longer. Once or twice, indeed,
we received intelligence from our scouts of hostile
detachments hovering at a distance. Ibn-Aly immediately
gave the signal for the alert, and sallied
forth with all that were able to bear arms; but the
first time we could not even, spite of all our diligence,
get sight of the retreating enemy. In our
second sally, indeed, we descried him, and in such
superior force, that we had our tents taken down
and our harems packed up in baskets, in order to be
ready for retreat if necessary; but on this occasion
as on the former, the foe fell back at our approach,
and disappeared in the desert, without giving us
any other trouble than that of again unpacking our
families and unfolding our tents. My regrets were
not outrageous. The age of my disinterested passion
for blows was past; and I saw a chance of little
else, where Arab met Arab.</p>

<p>Nothing thus materially accelerating or retarding
the swiftness of our march, except the greater or
less abundance of provender for our horses and pasture
for our sheep, we advanced till within three or
four conacks<sup id="r285"><a href="#n285">285</a></sup> of El-hassa. Unfortunately the facility
of our progress had lulled us into a fatal security.
Every evening the whole camp used at an
early hour to yield to the sweets of repose, trusting
almost entirely for safety to the vigilance of the
watch dogs that guarded its approaches. One night

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

a most tremendous barking of our four-footed sentinels
spread on a sudden a general alarm. Those
among us who were already sunk in sleep started
up, and those who were still watchful ran to their
weapons. Busy with some preparations for the
next day's march, I had continued moving about,
and already had incurred reproaches for my restlessness,
when this appalling concert drove away for
the moment all thoughts save of combat. I took a
hasty farewell of A&iuml;sch&eacute;, ran to untie my horse's
legs,<sup id="r286"><a href="#n286">286</a></sup> vaulted into my saddle, and rode in the direction
whence the growing noise proceeded. The
whole camp was already stirring: every one issued
forth in the greatest confusion from his tent, to inquire
of the other what had happened;&mdash;but this
no one could tell. Presently a distant clash of lances
gave to our apprehensions a more definite form and
a greater intensity. A hostile detachment, observed
several times on the preceding day, had contrived,
under favour of the night, to approach us in such
complete silence, as to leave every one of our biped
videttes unaware of its proximity, until our more
watchful four-footed outposts raised their warning
howl. Not knowing the number of our assailants,
darkness with its magnifying powers reported it to
be so great, that retreat was judged the only means
of escaping discomfiture. Even this however could
not be effected except under cover of a partial resistance,

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

and, as soon as Ibn-Aly had collected a
sufficient number of men, he went out in quest of the
enemy. I joined him on his way, as likewise did my
friend Omar. Never was disorder equal to that
which our camp now presented. The group of
watch dogs alarmed the first, had, by their howlings,
gradually set barking all the remainder of our canine
divisions unto the most remote; whence, with the
certainty of being attacked on some point, we knew
not in the least where to direct our defence, ran like
blind people to the sound, and left the guidance of
our motions entirely to chance. Sometimes thinking
ourselves in contact with the enemy when farthest
from the point of his attack, and at others fancying
our assailants a mile off when in the midst of their
troop, our offensive and our defensive operations
were equally ill-timed: half the night we fought
with empty space, and the other half pursued our
own comrades. The watch dogs themselves, bewildered
by the engagement, and no longer distinguishing
in the fray between friends and foes, fell
on both alike, and not only by their incessant yells
so increased the horrors of the fight, but by their
savage fury so augmented the bloodshed, that we
were obliged to kill several of our old guardians,
now unwittingly become our destroyers. As however
every instant brought from the interior of the
camp fresh supplies to the scene of action, we contrived

<!-- vol 3 page 215 -->

to make a stout defence, without sensibly
losing ground.</p>

<p>Mean time the portion of the tribe not engaged
in its protection was no less busily employed in its
removal. Some were taking down the tents, others
putting up the utensils and baggage, others again
loading the beasts of burthen; while here and there
a party stole out, and, unseen by the hostile troop,
drove the cattle into the part of the desert most out
of reach of danger. Thus, in less than two hours,
the whole camp was broken up, and on the move.
The combatants on our side hereupon began to
slacken their exertions, and to keep up a more
retreating skirmish. This was the easier as the
enemy himself, finding an unlooked for resistance,
seemed more anxious to secure the booty made
than to incur fresh blows in the pursuit of further
prizes, and testified a great desire to slink quietly
away, ere the dawn should discover his weakness,
and bring succour from other camps to reinforce
our strength. Thus, while we fell back in one
direction, our assailants did the same in the other;
and several times we were greatly tempted to
wheel about, and to attempt the recovery of our
captured equipages: but the fear of a surprise overcame
this desire. Continuing our retrograde movement
unslackened while darkness lasted, we compassed
a distance of near six leagues from the place
of combat, before the incipient dawn threw any

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

light upon our condition. The first rays of the
sun showed the whole plain, as far as the eye could
reach, covered with camels and other beasts of
burthen, pacing singly or in small groups, loaded
with tents, luggage, women and children, and intermixed
with droves of oxen and flocks of sheep&mdash;every
moment endeavouring to stop and graze,
unconscious of danger. The horsemen, who thus
far had kept together in tolerably close order, now
fell asunder like a bundle of sticks untied, and
eagerly set off, each for some different point of the
compass; so that presently nothing was seen in
every direction but warriors, crossing each other at
full speed like shooting stars: each seeking, among
the widely dispersed apparatus of the camp, his own
family, furniture, and equipages.</p>

<p>For my part, I soon had the satisfaction of descrying
my A&iuml;sch&eacute; in the midst of her retinue, or
rather towering over it on a dromedary tall as a
house, and, bating the uneasiness she had felt on
my account, in perfect health as well as safety. On
seeing me, after much anxious search, suddenly reappear
alive and unhurt, her joy was indescribable:
she gave a scream of delight; and at the same moment
her whole suite welcomed me with shouts of
pleasure.</p>

<p>It is dreadful at all times to lose what we love:
but far more dreadful is the shock, when, after a
period of intense alarm, the loss takes place just as

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

all danger seems to be gone by, and nothing apparently
remains but to exult in a renewed term of
safety and of bliss,&mdash;when the fresh blow of sorrow
is struck just as the heart begins anew to dilate with
all the fullest exuberance of frantic joy; and above
all, when that blow arises, not from the evil dreaded,
but precisely from its being overcome.</p>

<p>Such was my fate. Forgetting her exalted situation
or unable to check her impatience, A&iuml;sch&eacute;
tried, unassisted, to meet my embrace. In the hurry
of the break up, her camel had been loosely girt.
The sudden pressure made the pillion turn; she
fell to the ground, received a hurt which her condition
rendered mortal, and in a few hours expired
in my arms.</p>

<p>Assuredly at no time had my love for the living
A&iuml;sch&eacute; equalled my adoration of Euphrosyne, conceived
since I lost her. But without being a headlong
passion, my regard for my Bedoween wife was
a sincere attachment. It rested on esteem and on
gratitude, on endearing recollections and on fond
and flattering hopes; and I had begun to feel the
full value even of a love, for which I could only
make a less ardent return. All was dashed to the
ground in an instant, and long I dwelt on the first
of my sorrows inflicted by Providence alone, and
free from all mixture of self-reproach.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="v3ch09">

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first anguish of my feelings had scarcely
begun to subside, when the schaichs of the different
Wahhab tribes received a summons to lead out
their followers, and to meet Ibn-Sehood near a particular
well in the desert, whence they were to start
on a distant expedition. The name of the enemy,
or the point of attack, we were, according to the
custom of the Wahhab commanders, only to learn
on proceeding from the place of rendezvous. Ample
room was left meanwhile for conjecture, and every
instant fresh surmises were again abandoned for
others of still later birth. Some expected a coup-de-main
on Mekka, others an attempt upon Imam-Aly.
From all quarters the schaichs of every rank
hastened with their vassals to the spot appointed,
some on dromedaries swifter than the wind, others
on steeds not less fleet; one half armed with pistols
and match-locks, the other accoutred only with
sabres and lances, and none encumbered with more
provision than two skins could hold&mdash;the one filled
with flour, and the other with water. When
collected, we might muster about fifteen thousand

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

men; though our enemies, deceived by the rapidity
of our motions and the distant points on which we
often appeared almost at the same instant, gave
us credit for far superior numbers. No army
could be better appointed both for offensive and
defensive warfare, or could combine more active
courage with more passive hardihood. Every where
the wariest caution accompanied the most undaunted
fanaticism, and whatever the supreme schaich of
the nation might command for the advancement
of the faith, his followers expressed themselves determined
to achieve, or to die. In short, we
seemed to hold in our hands the fate of the Turkish
empire.</p>

<p>But here let me for a moment interrupt my narration:
warned by aches which had relented for a
while only to return with double fury, let me inquire
for what purpose my memoirs were begun,
and in what guise I must pursue them, to insure
its attainment. The interruption will not be long,
and the story proceed the more rapidly afterwards.</p>

<p>Unprincipled as my conduct must too often have
appeared, I might perhaps propitiate my reader,
at this advanced stage of my confession, by representing
it as a sort of voluntary penance, intended
to atone for my manifold offences. That I regret
them is most true; that I wish I could wipe them
away&mdash;were it with tears of blood&mdash;I conceal not:&mdash;but

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

far be from Anastasius even the show of believing,
that where bitter tears and better deeds have not
purified the sinner in the fulness of life, an idle disclosure
of his errors, only extorted by fear on the
brink of eternity, could still intercept his downfall,
and closing in his face the yawning furnaces of hell,
waft him triumphant to the portals of heaven:&mdash;and,
as to the very different design of daring the opinion
of the world, of defying its vengeance, and of making
my misdeeds a subject of contemptuous boasting:&mdash;on
the eve of escaping from all human pursuit in
the protecting arms of death; fast approaching that
cell where the shafts of man's resentment no longer
can hurt my insensible remains, it would too soon
for my credit be recognized as the vain vaunting
only of secure cowardice.</p>

<p>Anastasius has not, in thrusting his foolish life
upon the world, been actuated by motives either so
distant as the first, or so daring as the others.</p>

<p>In a strange country, uncheered by a single voice
not wholly new to my ears, and on a bed of sickness&mdash;only
to be exchanged for the cold pillow of
death, but retaining in a body worn out by suffering
a mind still restless, still struggling with its
fetters, how can I beguile the heavily creeping
hours, how obtain a moment's forgetfulness of my
prostration, how divert my thoughts from that
future which no longer can be mine, but by directing
all the remaining strength of my faculties to

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

the contemplation of that past of which I had my
share. Thus only, though the sun of my days is
set to rise no more, and though the voice of my
friends can reach me no longer&mdash;though the gay
are far off, and the good are gone by&mdash;may I still, in
the twilight which precedes my last sleep, conjure
up round my couch both the dead and the distant,
and in my silence and solitude converse with the
world.</p>

<p>This indeed must, throughout every page of these
memoirs, have been recognised as the only aim of
their writer: for every where my views have been
directed to my external condition rather than to
my internal emotions. Every where I have sought
the amusement of describing scenes beheld, rather
than the occupation of analysing sentiments experienced;
every where I have exhibited myself rather
as an unconcerned spectator in the world's motley
drama, than as an actor very deeply concerned in
the plot; every where I have tried to force myself
to gaiety, even with a heart filled with anguish. Intent
only on finding for each new passing day its
fresh chapter, I have strung together characters as
I met them, and incidents as they revolved before
my too often aching eyes; and lest my employment
should fail me ere I became reckless of my occupation,
I have sought rather to spin out my materials
in a good long prosing journal, than to compress
them in a round and compact tale.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

<p>And in this way I would have gone on to the end
of my narration, had not during its course a new
object sprung up, a new interest arisen, a new wish
invaded my unresisting mind.</p>

<p>But so it has happened: for that passion which,
once admitted in the human breast, never again
entirely quits its hold; that passion which, when
the more volatile desires of youth and vigor yield to
age and infirmity, only founds on their ruins its
more exclusive empire; that passion which enables
the decaying elder to survive his own existence
by living on the past and the future, when the
present eludes his feeble grasp; that passion which,
daunted by nothing but obscurity and silence, represents
the oblivion of the world as the direst of
calamities, and prefers the fellest persecution to
peaceful insignificance; that passion, by men called
vanity, but the best gift of the gods, could not see
me thus carefully collecting the materials of my
life, without prompting me to combine them into
a monument fitted to last after my death, and to
inform after ages, that I too, like millions of others,
had strutted my short hour on the stage of this
globe: and, lest a circumstance so momentous to
the world should be left unrecorded or should only
be partially told, I now feel a wish to bring to its
regular conclusion, what before I had hoped not to
have time to finish: I now should regret being torn
away from my narrative, before I had carried it down

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

to that decisive day, which saw me placed in a situation
no longer liable to changes worth recording:&mdash;for,
though I too well know that in my present
situation I can only have for my readers those
strangers of the west, who, from their distant corner
of the globe watch the inhabitants of its more genial
zones, as children do a worm, to wonder at its motions,
and to thank God that they are formed of
other mould, yet even a small niche in their remembrance
seems so much preferable to entire oblivion,
that, lest I might not otherwise have appeared to
possess monstrosities sufficient to find favour in
their eyes, I have perhaps even exaggerated my
infirmities and kept back my better qualities, as of
no value except to the owner.</p>

<p>Every succeeding hour, however, now begins to
warn me in a more audible voice, that, unless my pen
makes greater speed, my illness&mdash;gaining ground
too fast upon it&mdash;must defeat this new object, and
bring my life to a conclusion ere my tale is achieved.
To be able still to attain the goal, I must henceforth
loiter less on the road: I must make shorter
halts in those insulated spots neither connected with
what precedes nor with what follows; and, since my
sojourn among the Wahhabees proved to be of that
description, except in as far as, by breaking through
my old habits and suggesting new thoughts, it enabled
me to return to civilised regions with a mind

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

more matured and feelings greatly chastened, I
shall despatch the account of its remainder as concisely
as possible.</p>

<p>Suffice it therefore to say, with regard to the
great schemes meditated by my hosts, that, whatever
might be their purport, I beheld not their
execution. Suleiman's crafty kehaya, informed of
my stay among the Wahhabees, and afraid of my
influence over their councils, hastened to effect the
greatest injury his enmity could do me,&mdash;that of
making me appear his friend. So ingeniously was
a letter from the miscreant fraught with whatever
might give me the appearance of betraying my
employers, and so dexterously was it made to fall
into their hands, that Abd-ool-Azeez could not
refrain from summoning me before him, to vindicate
my innocence or to suffer for my crime. My
punishment was to consist in utter expulsion from
the tribe whose countenance I had forfeited. Former
hospitality forbade severer penalties.</p>

<p>Had my A&iuml;sch&eacute;&mdash;permitted to preserve her innocent
existence&mdash;promised to cheer with tender
cares the evening of my restless life, even simple
banishment from her abode might have seemed an
infliction sufficiently severe. Reconciled by habit
to the manners of the Wahhabees, I could gladly
have ended my days where, only seeking refuge
from an enemy, I had most unexpectedly found

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

a friend, a family, and a home. One object had
indeed by degrees so strongly entwined itself with
all my future schemes, as to have become an indispensable
condition of my felicity in whatever
abode I might choose; and this was my darling
child, my Alexis: but him I had purposed soon to
send for; and then&mdash;forgetting and forgotten in the
land of my birth&mdash;I might without repining resign
my breath among strangers, and leave my worthless
bones to whiten in the desert.</p>

<p>But far differently now stood the case. A&iuml;sch&eacute;
was no more, my ties upon Wahhab's children cut
asunder, and I again become the lone mortal whom
a single Arab stopped on his first entering the
desert. Since the loss of that which had endeared
to me its sands, the secret wish again to press the
hallowed soil which bore my Alexis had revived
with such intensity, that all other schemes lost their
relish in my eyes. To return to the only being in this
world whom I could call my own, to bestow upon
him that paternal care which he thus far had never
known, to cherish him in my long estranged bosom,
and to render him the sole and permanent solace of
my remaining days, was henceforth the only happiness
after which I thirsted; and, under the influence
of this all-subduing feeling, I almost hailed
Achmet's fraud as a fortunate event&mdash;as a circumstance
which, by causing me to be banished from
the desert for injuries intended the Wahhabees ere

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

I had experienced their kindness, might spare me
the pain of appearing, in contempt of all gratitude,
to leave them from choice, after their best gifts had
again brightened my existence.</p>

<p>When therefore the charge of treachery was preferred
against me; when the kehaya's letter was
read, and when my expected defence kept every
breath suspended, every eye intently fixed, and
every neck on the stretch, I only answered the accusation
with sullen and haughty silence: but, if
that very strangeness of my behaviour made Abd-ool-Azeez
doubt my guilt and Omar loudly assert
my innocence, it left the one without power to absolve,
and the other without an excuse for detaining
me. They suffered the wayward stranger to depart
from among them; and I disdainfully went on my
way, taking with me only&mdash;a few endearing recollections
excepted&mdash;the little I had brought. My
course lying westward, I bent my steps at once
towards the setting sun, and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">[In this place the manuscript leaves us to regret the loss of
a few pages, which have been either cancelled by the author
himself, or torn out by strange hands after his death. The
interruption however seems to be of little consequence; the
text, where it recommences, shows Anastasius moving on a
new but not very distant stage, and describing only a different
Arab tribe from that among which,&mdash;as he himself says,&mdash;he
found, and again lost, a friend, a wife, and a home.]</p>

<p>It is&mdash;he resumes&mdash;the most numerous and powerful

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

of the tribes which reside in the interior of the
Hedjas. Its principal schaich can singly bring into
the field an army of upwards of three thousand
horse, well armed and well equipped: nearly twenty
inferior schaichs acknowledge him as their supreme
lord; and the great schaich of the tribe of Anahs&eacute;,
who resides at Ke&iuml;bar in the Nedjd, never fails, in
any expedition worthy of their joint powers, to
assist him with a numerous division of his choicest
troops.</p>

<p>By means of this union of strength the Arabs
of the Harb mock the Sultan unreproved, whenever
he tries anew to revive his obsolete claims as their
sovereign; and, for the permission to lead the pilgrims
through its trackless sands on their journey to
Mekkah, they exact from his representative the Pasha
of Damascus a yearly fine, which this Visier fails not
to charge in his turn to the account of the Porte.</p>

<p>Djezzar, who in the year 1794 still reigned at
Damascus as well as at Acre, persuaded himself that
a double escort would enable him to cross the
Hedjas without paying this impost; and when the
schaichs of the desert presented themselves on his
passage to claim the customary toll, they only received
an insulting refusal. Unprepared for compulsory
measures, they were obliged for the moment
to abide the indignity, but early the next season the
schaichs of the Harb and of Anahs&eacute; quitted their
abodes of Ke&iuml;bar and of Khaff, in order to watch

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

from their camps the opportunity for joint and just
revenge.</p>

<p>The annual march of the Hadj is so regular, the
different stations where it halts are so exactly determined,
the day and hour of its passing through
every district on its route vary so little, that whatever
Bedoween may have any suits to settle with
any of its divisions, need only consult their own
convenience as to the time and place. They may
stop the caravan according to their pleasure either
in its coming or its return, and, of the far stretching
string of pilgrims, they may select for their respondents
just whatever part they think most likely to afford
them both easy and ample satisfaction.</p>

<p>On the present occasion the caravan was suffered
in its outward march to reach Mekkah unmolested,
in order that, on its return, a presumptuous security
might render it an easier prey. The vicinage of
Khedieh, a town two days journey distant from
Medineh, was fixed upon as the spot most favourable
for the meditated surprise; and, as the pilgrims
always make a three days halt at Medineh, in order
to pay their devotions at the Prophet's tomb, the
day on which they were to arrive in that city was
that of our departure from our different stations to
meet near the walls of Khedieh.</p>

<p>The Emir's own division was the foremost to arrive
at the place of rendezvous. It took post behind
a small hill, whose summit afforded every

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

convenience for watching the approaching Hadj,
and whose reverse was equally well adapted for
concealing our own force. Emissaries were immediately
despatched to reconnoitre, and to report at
what distance the pilgrims might still be.</p>

<p>Mean time the Emir went about giving his last
instructions to his troops. "Remember!" said he;
"we only wish to obtain our dues from an unjust
visier; not to injure a set of unoffending hadjees.
Therefore, attack property&mdash;but spare lives. Direct
your chief efforts where you see the most merchandise,
and the fewest soldiers. Useless shedding of
blood should be avoided. If we kill the Osmanlees,
who will hereafter want our camels?"</p>

<p>This excellent advice seemed for once fated to be
thrown away. The scouts sent out had not advanced
far before they returned utterly dismayed,
and already from a distance making signs of bad
news. As soon as within hearing: "All is lost,"
they cried. "The miscreant Djezzar, pushing on
from Medineh the very day of his arrival, is already
gone by. Perhaps from some eminence the rear of
his force may still appear in sight!"</p>

<p>At these provoking words the Emir immediately
galloped off at full speed to a commanding height,
about half a mile off, to ascertain whether he had
indeed been twice deceived by the wily Bosniaque.
Most of us followed. Arrived within a few yards

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

of the summit, we dismounted, and, crouching
down, advanced among the bushes.</p>

<p>In an instant all conjecture was at an end. Along
the furthermost outskirts of the boundless plain
still remained clearly discernible the long dark line
of pilgrims, winding their weary way through the
white sands, like a black and slender millipede,
whose anterior extremity already has entered some
crevice, while the thousand legs of the body and
tail follow apace. Ere however the other still
wanting detachments had joined our force, it would
have been foolhardiness to pursue the enemy, and
after all were collected, it would be too late to overtake
his flying troops. So adieu our brilliant hopes!
A bird's eye view of the fleeting caravan was the
reward of our mighty preparations.</p>

<p>At this sight a deep gloom overspread the Emir's
countenance. He struck his spear with fury into
the ground, convulsively grasped the long braids of
his black hair, and, after musing awhile&mdash;his eyes
all the time fiercely rolling in his head&mdash;"let us
return," he cried, "to our homes; and after having
sounded the trump of war through the desert, hush,
if we can, the irksome echo!"</p>

<p>Down the hill he now again rushed, and after
him all his followers, heaping every variety of malediction
upon that vile Djezzar, who, against all rule
and precedent, had hurried on where no Pasha had

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

ever hurried on before,&mdash;and that too, for no purpose
but to give us the slip.</p>

<p>Just as we got to the bottom of the hill, came
scrambling up to meet us the last of our scouts.
We cared so little for a fresh confirmation of our
disappointment, that, ere the man had time to unclose
his lips, we desired him not to take the trouble
of delivering his message, and this the more, as he
seemed to carry a face of joy which we thought
exceedingly ill timed, and for which the Emir gave
him a sharp and proper rebuke. Long therefore
did he struggle, and many fruitless attempts did he
make, before he could convey to our understandings
that he really brought good news;&mdash;and this
was its purport.</p>

<p>The Pasha of Damascus, goaded by his evil conscience,
had indeed escaped our vengeful clutches;
but the Bey of Egypt still remained at Medineh,
and was to escort back part of the way, in addition
to his Cairo caravan, a great portion of that of
Syria, which, wholly unprepared for Djezzar's diligence,
had been left in the care of the trusty El-Ashkar.
The number of pilgrims would thus remain
nearly the same as before, and that of troops alone
be diminished: but this reduction, though it might
leave the Emir fewer laurels to gather, he could
contemplate with becoming philosophy. Out therefore
he poured his whole weight of anxiety in one
single long protracted sigh of relief and of joy;

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

and scarce was it brought to a conclusion, when all
the different divisions of our allies, still wanting,
arrived in sight at once. We now spent the night
in delightful expectations, and the next morning
stationed ourselves in ambush behind a range of
low hills, a few hundred yards from the track of the
looked-for caravan.</p>

<p>According to immemorial custom, the Magarbees
or men from the west&mdash;in other words the Barbaresques&mdash;in
going form the rear, and in returning
the van of the Cairo hadj. Loaded with arms, and
light of baggage, they were deemed unworthy of
the honour of our notice. So far from attempting
to stop these honest gentlemen, apt to deal in no
weighty article save blows, we on the contrary
wished Heaven might speed them on their way.
Even the lofty Osman himself, who came next with
his kehayas, his body guard, and his remaining
troops, we permitted to pass unmolested&mdash;though
I longed to break one more lance with some of my
old Cairo cronies: but when the great fat merchants,
who kept aloof even from their own escort&mdash;full
as much dreaded by them as any Arabs&mdash;in
their turn were seen to approach, panting with
heat, and in a cluster formed for the very purpose
that we might seize it at one grasp, the eyes of our
men glistened with joy, and my fingers began to
itch like those of a physician at sight of his fee. In
the interval between the passing on of the worthless

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

rabble which preceded, and the approach of these
men of substance, we sprang forward, and, posting
ourselves in the middle of the way, cut off the rear
completely from the body of the caravan, and called
to our friends to stop, and be rifled.</p>

<p>At the shouts of terror occasioned by this little
compliment, it is said that the great Ashkar himself
disdained not to turn round his head, in order to
inquire the cause: of which being duly informed,
he valiantly clapped his stirrups to his horse, and
set off at full speed;&mdash;all his veterans gallantly followed
the example of their chief.</p>

<p>Thus abandoned by their defenders, the pilgrims
only sought to save their persons, and left their
property to its fate. In less than five minutes the
whole field of battle was strewed with camels, horses,
and mules, laden with every sort of goods. We had
nothing to do but to gather the manna showered
around by Providence. Every man seized upon
what was nearest to him, and when two or three
happened to pull at the same parcel, they drew their
sabres and divided the bundle.</p>

<p>Where predatory expeditions like the present
were considered as praiseworthy, not only in the
leaders of tribes but in their humblest followers;
where each successful robbery only conferred fresh
distinction on its authors; where every wayfaring
man resigned himself beforehand to the chance of
being despoiled, and the sufferer regretted his loss

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

without blaming his assailant, I carried not my
scruples of honesty so far as alone to deny myself a
share in the common privilege: but it was my folly
on this occasion to be fastidious in its exercise. I
would not strip a poor pedlar, or a hadjee in humble
trim. All the ordinary pickings I haughtily passed
by, and abandoned to the greedier Arabs. Indeed
I did worse. To my eternal shame be it spoken, I
assisted two or three wretches in making their
escape, after helping them to lift up their bundles.
At the same time I felt no very insurmountable
objection to some single rich equipage falling in my
way, rather than in that of a parcel of vagabonds,
who would not know its value or feel obliged to its
owner. Unfortunately I proceeded on so far in
my desultory ramble&mdash;disdaining every unimportant
prize which I met&mdash;that at last I met nothing more,
got clean out of the track of the plunder, and fell
in with no further booty either great or small.</p>

<p>I now began to repent me of my squeamishness.
Small prizes after all were better than blanks; and
it happened not unfrequently that a pilgrim's tattered
garments concealed a perfectly whole purse.
This reflection would have urged me to retrace my
steps, but that I was sure of no longer finding even
what I had left untouched. While my time had
been spent in idle promenading, there was little
doubt that the field must have been gleaned by my
more industrious companions unto the last ear.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

<p>Precisely, however, when I thought all chance of
doing any good entirely gone by, fortune was pleased
to reward my forbearance. In an interstice between
two small hillocks which suddenly opened upon my
view, appeared at the head of a string of camels
heavily laden, a well mounted merchant, only intent
upon rejoining the hindmost troop of the Bey's
soldiers, just diving into a hollow before him.</p>

<p>I cried to the diligent hadjee to stop, and to
deliver up his property,&mdash;and thus addressed, he
thought fit to look round; but seeing me quite
alone, he only answered: "I was welcome to whatever
I could take,"&mdash;and spurred on his horse the
faster. He judged rightly enough that, unsupported
as I was, I could scarce be deemed a match for six
or eight sturdy and well armed fellows, who, while
he spoke, sprung forth from behind his huge camels,
and grinning from ear to ear at their master's ready
wit, showed me on a line with their white teeth the
black muzzles of their guns. This sight somewhat
cooled the ardor of my pursuit: from a full gallop
I fell into a canter, and from that into a trot, until
at last I pulled up entirely, and, puzzled how to act,
stood awhile stock still, not liking to advance, and
not less averse to retiring empty-handed.</p>

<p>Fortunately at that moment came up from the
eastward a troop of ten or twelve Arabs, belonging
to a small and distant tribe, usually buried in the
deepest sands of the desert. These gentlemen had

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

not originally participated in our plan of attacking
the Hadj, but hearing of the scheme by accident,
had advanced beyond their usual beat, on the mere
chance of what they might pick up. Most readily
they consented&mdash;on seeing my dilemma&mdash;to lend
me their assistance; while the merchant's escort,
perceiving this reinforcement, at once passed from
a show of the utmost resolution to that of the most
dastardly fear. In their confusion, these brave
guardians of the property committed to their care
fired from behind their four-footed battery one single
volley,&mdash;just to exasperate their pursuers,&mdash;and
then scampered off with all their might, leaving me
in undisturbed possession of the goods and chattels
which&mdash;as has been seen&mdash;their master had before
most formally made over to me, in the presence of
reputable witnesses.</p>

<p>Luckily I had to divide the richest prize of the
caravan with the most ignorant Arabs of the desert.
My associates in this excellent affair only valued
goods according to their bulk and weight. The
refuse articles, the outside envelopes&mdash;coarse cottons,
clumsy shaloons, stuffs like packing cloth,
and trinkets like horse trappings&mdash;were what they
chiefly coveted. The shawls fine as cobwebs, the
muslins thin as gossamer, the silks like summer
clouds, they held in utter contempt. A bag of
pearls from the Ormus bank, of the size of full-grown
filberts, they tasted; but finding them hard

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

and insipid, they flung the good-for-nothing pulse
away, and left it for me to cram into my girdle.
In like manner, when,&mdash;searching about for the
pearls which had dropped out&mdash;I picked up a little
casket which lay by itself on the ground and seemed
to have been lost only from a special anxiety to save
it, my tasteful friends, who saw nothing in an assortment
of rubies and diamonds&mdash;none in truth much
larger than myrtleberries&mdash;but a parcel of glass
beads fit only for children, let me keep them in
exchange for a huge bale of calicoes. In consequence
of these two lucky hits, I became so generous
in the division of the remainder of the spoil,
that, grave as the party seemed by nature, they
could not help smiling at my folly; and I have
no doubt that some facetiousness on the subject
would have come out in due time, but for the fear
which haunted the interlopers of being observed,
and made to give the Emir an account of their
capture. This rather serious consideration now
rendered them anxious to be gone, and with good
wishes to me and significant glances at each other,
they sped away.</p>

<p>I myself was not sorry to find a secluded nook,
safe from intrusion, in which to take the first inventory
of my new riches. When I opened them
out, and viewed in its full blaze the treasure I
possessed, I fell upon my knees, and devoutly
thanked Providence for having made the merchant

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

to whom I owed it a wag, and for inspiring him
with a witticism, which, without being particularly
good in itself, was nevertheless a most happy one
for his despoiler, whom it enabled to keep the property
acquired, with a safe conscience. This act
of devout gratitude performed, I neatly inserted my
baubles between the folds of my belt and the plaits
of my turban, and, thus safe from the danger of
exciting envy, went back to our party, trailing after
me&mdash;with great apparent exertion&mdash;an enormous
bundle of very ordinary goods, fully resigned to the
raillery which I met with from the Arabs, for bringing
home, among so much valuable plunder, so
contemptible a capture.</p>

<p>My present opulence would alone have sufficed
to renew my yearnings after more polished regions,
had I felt none before. Undoubtedly poverty was
easiest to be borne among the poor: but with a
pocket full of pearls and diamonds, who could live
upon dry locusts? especially when possessing in the
west, as I did, a little treasure far more precious
than diamonds or than pearls, which the gems I
had gained would enable me to adorn like the little
jewel of my heart. The longing to return to
Smyrna, already powerfully felt among the Wahhabees,
now increased in Nadder's camp to such a
degree, that the soil of the desert seemed to burn
under my feet. An impression began to haunt me
that, unless I quitted it immediately, some insurmountable

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

obstacle would inevitably keep me spell-bound
in its sands for the remainder of my life.</p>

<p>My companions, however, were not people to
entrust with these feelings. They dealt not much
in sentimentality, but had a notion of keeping in
the desert things earned in the desert. With a
proper respect for this prejudice, I equipped myself
as if only going to visit a neighbouring camp, and
set out at a slow pace, in a careless and indolent
manner: but, like a school-boy who designs to
play truant, I quickened by degrees my step, got
into an easy trot, from that into a canter, and
finally,&mdash;as soon as I had turned the last corner
from which I thought I could be watched,&mdash;clapped
my stirrups to my horse, and darted through
the plain.</p>

<p>I had scarce performed three leagues, when, a
little way before me, appeared a personage whose
accoutrement belonged not to the desert, and whose
answer to my call in fact proved him to be a hadjee,
separated from his companions by the discomfiture
of the morning. I spurred on to join the stranger,
as he did with all his might to avoid me. At last,
finding his pursuer gain ground fast upon him, he
looked back, and without stopping or taking the
least aim, fired at me both his pistols. Neither of
them fortunately bore within thirty yards of the
mark: but I took the will for the deed, and ran at
the uncourteous pilgrim with my spear couched. He

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

escaped the shock by his alacrity in ducking. Not
choosing to waste my powder, or to alarm the desert,
I hereupon drew my dagger. My hadjee now assumed
a most piteous and supplicating posture.
"Crush not," he cried, "the insect that crawls in
the dust. It was fright alone that made me fire. I
never show the least symptom of bravery except
when terrified out of my senses!"&mdash;The defence
made me laugh: "Take your life," said I, "but
give up your money." "Alas!" replied the hadjee,
"what money would you have me possess,&mdash;I, who
am contracted for; and visit the holy places as
proxy only for a rich man, who takes care not to
pay me, until he receives at my own hands the
vouchers for my performance of the pilgrimage?"
The excuse was ingenious: but my friend proved to
have a purse of gold notwithstanding, and I doubted
a while whether I should not take the money which,
by his own account he did not want, and the pistols
which he knew not how to use: but the ample fortune
which I had just acquired enabled me to disdain
the paltry prize. So I wished the <i>insect</i> well through
the deep sands&mdash;and resumed my former pace.</p>

<p>Unwilling to travel close on the heels of a caravan,
which I had helped to lighten of its burthen,
I determined to lean rather more to the left, and
to steer towards Acre, in preference to Damascus.
Long therefore was the journey, and many were
the perils, and much was I beholden to the swiftness

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

of my horse, even though I only travelled in
the night-time. Sometimes I had a guide, but
mostly the stars alone directed my course. Equally
tired of listening to the one and looking at the
other, I built innumerable castles in the air, and
formed endless schemes for my future conduct: but,
first and foremost&mdash;laugh not, reader,&mdash;was that
of becoming inflexibly honest!</p>

<p>When arrived within half a day's journey of Acre,
I considered in what shape I might best meet the
gaze of cities. Constant alarms and fatigues had
so altered my appearance, that it was impossible to
know me. My eyes were sunk in their sockets,
and my bones starting through the skin. By contriving
on the road to run my lance through my
foot, I had produced a wound, and this wound was
become so envenomed an ulcer, that it made a halt
an indispensable condition to the cure. At the same
time, in the residence of Djezzar, whose displeasure
I had once before incurred by cropping a friar's
beard, and had now deserved afresh by curtailing a
pilgrim's equipage, some disguise seemed advisable.
The character of a Bedoween agreeing ill with my
long features and unguttural accent, I determined
upon the less difficult part of a Turkish santon.<sup id="r287"><a href="#n287">287</a></sup>
Its sacred garb would enable me at once to avoid
the inconveniences of poverty, and the suspicion of
wealth. The transformation was speedily effected.

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

I pushed on again, and soon reached Acre,&mdash;just
two years from the day on which I left Bagdad.</p>

<p>The first face I met in the city appeared short of
its nose;&mdash;I had witnessed that deficiency elsewhere.
The next was minus an eye;&mdash;that too is sometimes
seen in other countries:&mdash;but the third had no ears,
the fourth no lips; and there seemed to be walking
about as many people possessed of one hand only
as of two. At last, meeting a man whom I was not
afraid to question on this local singularity, in as
much as&mdash;by some singular piece of good luck apparently&mdash;he
still retained the possession of his full
set of limbs and features, I civilly accosted him,
expressed my joy at seeing his eyes, ears, nose,
mouth, &amp;c, all complete; and finally begged to ask
how it happened that this occurrence was so rare at
Acre?</p>

<p>"You are a stranger, it seems," answered the
man, "and have not yet been taught the mark of
our master:&mdash;it is by these peculiarities our shepherd
knows his flock. Every sinner here receives
it;&mdash;but, remember, some saints are not exempted.</p>

<p>I thanked my informer for his friendly caution,
and, little enamoured of Djezzar's ugly mark, gave,
in the abode which I reluctantly sought, as little
eclat to my sanctity as possible. Unambitious of
extending my fame, I only made the few pious
grimaces, and performed the few miraculous cures,

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

which I could not possibly avoid in support of
my character. My healing powers, however&mdash;like
those of most sainted personages&mdash;proved very
little convertible to my own use. Amidst all the
bedevilled whom I exorcised, and all the epileptics
whom I <i>unfitted</i>, my own wound healed very slowly.
In the mean time my host&mdash;a man of some intelligence&mdash;gave
me a short history of Djezzar, which
I shall insert here, not so much for the edification
of the world, as only to get rid, during a few pages,
of that eternal <i>I</i> which haunts all the rest of my
narrative.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="v3ch10">

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bosnia</span> brought forth the monster, since surnamed
el-Djezzar or the Butcher. Born a Christian,
and bred a carpenter, young Dimitri first signalised
himself by slaying his brother with his axe. This
feat compelled him to fly from his country: but as
gratitude is the characteristic of noble minds, and
as one of the implements of Dimitri's trade had
been the instrument of his fratricide, he remembered
in after times the instrument which had
opened his way to greatness, and to his other titles
added that of Aboo-balta, or father of the axe.
The place in which he first sought refuge was that
sink of every vice and asylum of every miscreant,
the capital. On the road he had subsisted by
begging, on his arrival he sold himself as a slave.
His flaxen hair and fair complexion suited the
Cairo market. Aly-bey became his purchaser.
Converted to Islamism, and called by the name of
Achmet, our hero soon acquired great proficiency
in magic;<sup id="r288"><a href="#n288">288</a></sup>&mdash;and under the guidance of Egypt's ambitious
ruler, this art remained not in Achmet's
hands an idle pursuit: it afforded him the means
of conjuring away with more adroitness such as
had either disobliged, or had obliged the Bey too

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

much. Many heavy debts of gratitude were thus
cancelled, in a way which left the conferers no
possibility of complaining. For these services Aly-bey
first created Achmet a kiashef, and next, governor
of the Baha&iuml;r&eacute;. It was in this province that
one single year's exploits were sufficient to acquire
for him the title of Djezzar: but his patron, conceiving
some suspicions of his fidelity, ended not
the less that year by destining for the Butcher
himself that reward which, through his means, he
had conferred on so many others. Informed of
his danger, Achmet now a second time fled for his
life. He found an hospitable reception at the
court of Osman, Pasha of Damascus. This Visier
was waging war at the time against the Arab
Daher, by inheritance prince of the small territory
of Saphad, and, by conquest, ruler of the larger
district of Acre&mdash;dismembered from the pashalik
of Se&iuml;de. He sent Djezzar against the successful
enemy, at the head of a troop of his own countrymen&mdash;of
Bosniaques: but spite of their valour and
achievements, the Butcher could not prevent Daher
from at last rendering Se&iuml;de itself an appendage to
Acre, as Acre had formerly been to Se&iuml;de.</p>

<p>A singular race, inserted between the sea on one
side and Mount Lebanon on the other, owns allegiance
to the government of Se&iuml;de. Its name is
Deroozi, its capital Dair-el-Khammar or the city
of the Moon, and its religion a remnant of the

<!-- vol 3 page 246 -->

theology of the ancient Magi. In their schools the
initiated, as I am told, were taught that all things
sensible and intellectual emanated from a single
first Essence; that the souls of particular individuals&mdash;brute
or human&mdash;were only so many different
lesser portions detached from this primal
Essence, through an act of its own volition; that,
deprived, on their first separation, of their former
consciousness, these lesser divisions of the great
Whole were only awakened to different partial
degrees of self-knowledge, through means of the
different species of bodily envelopes which it pleased
the supreme Essence, their parent, successively to
weave around them; that the apparent removal
and transmigration of these distinct souls only arose
from the formation and decay of the various bodies
by which they were in turns occupied; and that,
as all things sensible and intellectual first emanated
from a single primordial Essence, so all things were
ultimately again, after a vast circle of vicissitudes
and developments&mdash;each rising in perfection beyond
every former one,&mdash;to be reabsorbed into
that primary Essence, and made partakers of its
Omniscience, and power, and glory. It must however
be owned, that, if the knowing ones among
the other sects prevailing in Syria pretend to trace
in the belief of the Deroozi the wrecks of this
high and ancient doctrine, the vulgar herd of the
Mahommedans and Christians of that province,

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

loth to burthen their intellects with such subtleties,
cut the matter short by asserting the creed of the
Deroozi to be the exact reverse of that of every
other nation; and averring that whatever the righteous
abominate, these pagans hold in reverence,
and whatever the righteous regard as sacred, they
treat as execrable;&mdash;and strange to tell, the Deroozi
themselves, who might be expected to know best of
any people the truth, and to possess, though no one
else should, the secret of their own doctrine, live
in utter and contented ignorance on the subject.
Among this singular nation not only religious practices,
but religious creed,&mdash;not only rites, worship,
offerings, fasts, and prayers, but doctrine and faith&mdash;remain 
the exclusive privilege of a peculiar caste,
named Akkhals or Sanctified; in whose society
none can be admitted that have not previously
given up all worldly concerns; and completely renounced
the interests, the occupations, and the
converse of the seculars. It is these who exclusively
take upon themselves the faith, and hold
themselves responsible for the salvation of the whole
community; and, while they are so jealous of their
knowledge that they suffer no secular even of their
own nation to be initiated in their dogmas, they
are so intolerant in their dogmas themselves, that
they admit no individual of any other race to the
salvation exclusively reserved for their own nation.
In vain would a stranger wish to subscribe to their

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

doctrine, or desire to be received into their community.
The gates of eternal bliss remain not the less
shut against him for ever. He might during the
whole of his life profess the religion of the Deroozi
with unremitting zeal; still must he at his death,
like the infidel he was born, be precluded from
their higher heaven; and only go to whatever less
enviable place of retribution is reserved for the remainder
of his unenlightened race.</p>

<p>As to the seculars, called by the priests djahels or
simples, they are all, from the prince down to the
peasant, held alike exempt from the performance
of religious practices, and from the profession of
religious tenets. The Emir or sovereign of the
nation is not more than the meanest of his subjects,
admitted by the akkhals to the mysteries of their
belief, or to the secrets of their worship; but, having
no rites or doctrine of their own, the Deroozi
laymen are the more ready to adopt in respect to
externals, the worship of whatever more powerful
nation it is their policy to court:&mdash;whence their
town and villages are filled with mosques, which
the inhabitants never enter&mdash;except when visited
by a Turk.</p>

<p>Among the Deroozi as among the Arabs, every
subject is a citizen, and every lay-citizen a soldier.
Military exercises are reckoned by this warlike
nation the highest of pleasures, and contempt of
death the first of virtues. Each district of their

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

country obeys the commands, or rather enjoys the
protection of an hereditary schaich, who with the
utmost simplicity of manners usually combines the
loftiest pride of birth, and, while he excludes no
one from his table, deems very few worthy of his
alliance. Among these families that of Schebab
enjoys the privilege of supplying the general ruler
of the nation, who, chosen by his brother chiefs,
takes the title of Emir, and resides at Dair-el-Khammar.
His authority is limited, and on every
affair of consequence he consults the other chiefs.</p>

<p>To the north of the land of the Deroozi lies the
country of the Mawarnee or Maronites, called Kesrowan,
and divided, like the former, into lesser
districts governed by hereditary schaichs. This
province pays allegiance to the Emir of the Deroozi,
who holds it of the Pasha of Trabloos, as he
does his own district of the Pasha of Se&iuml;de. The
character and mode of living of the Maronites only
differ from those of the Deroozi in a very few particulars,
such as must naturally arise from the
Christian religion they profess, and the communication
they have with the sea, through the port of
Bayroot. The inhabitants of the Kesrowan display
greater industry, and possess more skill in business
than their neighbours the Deroozi; and thence the
Deroozi schaichs generally choose Maronites as
stewards to their estates, and preceptors to their
children: the difference of creed forming a less

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

weighty objection, where the tutor is only called
upon to abstain from inculcating in his pupil any
religious belief whatsoever.</p>

<p>Emir Melhem, one of the Deroozi rulers of
whom his subjects spoke with the most veneration,
was among the few men who wish to leave an interval
between the pride of sovereignty and the
nothingness of the grave. He abdicated his worldly
power, left the society of the djahels, and among
the akkhals commenced preparing his soul for its
higher flight, about four years previous to its release
from its earthly shackles. His brother Mansoor
was, by the schaichs of Dair-el-Khammar,
named regent of the Deroozi until his son Youssoof
should come of age; but Youssoof saw himself,
through the interest of Sad-el-Koori his guardian&mdash;a
Maronite of the noble family of the Aw&acirc;kri,&mdash;immediately
recognized as ruler of the Kesrowan.
Of this honour the young prince appeared fully
worthy.&mdash;In the course of a single campaign he
conquered and re-annexed to his province the district
of Djeba&iuml;l, long dismembered from it by a
horde of scheyee Moslemen, called Mootaweelis,
living on the reverse of Mount Lebanon in the fertile
plain of Baalbe&iuml;t.</p>

<p>Military renown thus adding its support to his
hereditary rights, Youssoof claimed early the sovereignty
of the Deroozi, with such means of enforcing
his pretensions as Mansoor, his uncle, thought it

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

prudent not to disregard. Clothing necessity in
the garb of virtue, this chief professed only to have
held the supreme authority in trust for his nephew,
and in 1770 solemnly placed on Youssoof's finger
the seal of the reigning sovereign.</p>

<p>This event took place while Daher, prince of
Acre, was pursuing his conquests in Syria. Not
satisfied with taking Se&iuml;de, he at last laid siege to
Bayroot, the seaport of the Kesrowan, to which
Djezzar had retreated before him. The Butcher
succeeded in driving back the Arab: but instead
of restoring Bayroot to Youssoof its rightful prince,
for whom he had undertaken to defend the place,
he now declared he only held it in trust for the
Sultan; and with Youssoof's treasures, deposited
in it for safety, bought the investiture for himself
When, soon after, Hassan Capitan-Pasha drove
Daher out of Acre and Se&iuml;de, he was prevailed
upon to confer the whole of these pashaliks on
Djezzar, in recompense for his loyalty.</p>

<p>Following the example of his Arab predecessor,
Djezzar made Acre his residence in preference to
Se&iuml;de. The place was capable of an easier defence,
both on the sea and the land side. Nor did he
only give it strength: he also added beauty. The
splendid relics of Tyre and C&aelig;sarea were employed
to adorn its new erections; and soon arose within
Acre's turreted walls, a palace, a mosque, and a
bath, whose architecture, achieved as if by magic,
seemed worthy of the Devas.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 252 -->

<p>But joy was banished from these gorgeous edifices.
Djezzar's rapacity suffered it to enter neither the
hovels of the little nor the conacks of the great. By
converting every source of wealth into an article of
monopoly, he kept his subjects poor, while he measured
out his taxes as if he suffered them to grow
rich; and, when his cupidity by its excess defeated
its own purpose, it was in acts of refined cruelty
that he sought his consolation. Every rising sun
saw the torture applied; every day that passed was
marked by fresh executions. The tyrant's glittering
galleries re-echoed only with moans, his polished
pavements were moistened with tears, and his
marble terraces seemed adorned with crystal rills,
only in order that their pure waters might wash
away the streams of blood, with which they were
daily crimsoned. The wailings of the tortured
mixed themselves with the murmur of the fountains;
and from behind the porphyry and jasper
pannels of Djezzar's wide extending porticoes, were
heard the groans of wretches, expiring immured
within their unrelenting walls.</p>

<p>According to the immemorial custom of all eastern
despots, their treasure and their wives are kept
in the same enclosure, under the same ponderous
bolts. The sacredness of the gynec&aelig;um is rendered
subservient to the security of the hazn&eacute;. In Djezzar's
extended palace and citadel, however, a greater
excess of distrust had chosen a still more mysterious
spot for Plutus's sanctuary: the most internal recesses

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

of the Butcher's harem only formed the
outermost entrance of the receptacle, where lay concealed
his gold. Strength without and secrecy
within guarded this holy of holies. High ramparts,
deep fosses, and bulwarks bristling with cannon
surrounded the sacred cells, and dark subterraneous
passages only led to them by the most intricate
windings. Of these Djezzar alone possessed both
the design and the key:&mdash;never had their hapless
artificers been permitted to return to the daylight
which they quitted to build them; and their knowledge
and their bodies still reposed within their
fatal works. While none of the officers of the
palace dared to follow Djezzar into his harem, none
of the tenants of the harem itself were suffered to
cast after him the slightest look of inquiry, when,
like a threatening meteor, he rushed by his women,
darted through their numerous chambers, and vanished
at last in the mysterious labyrinth that led
to his treasure.</p>

<p>Djezzar was a barbarous husband as well as a
merciless master. His mamlukes, therefore, succeeded
in opening a correspondence with his wives,
for the purpose of procuring his death and dividing
his spoil. No one knows what foe to humanity
betrayed the well concerted plot: all saw too soon
that Djezzar knew his danger. Infuriate he rushed
into his harem, and for a while stabbed indiscriminately
all he met in his way. But soon he regretted

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

the too easy death vouchsafed to the first victims of
his rage, and caused the remainder to envy, by the
tortures he made them endure, the milder fate of
their predecessors. His own hands&mdash;it is said&mdash;submitted
to the rack those charms in which he had
rioted by preference, and the greatness of the raptures
he had tasted became the measure of the
pangs he inflicted.<sup id="r289"><a href="#n289">289</a></sup></p>

<p>Even the seclusion and the thick walls of the
women's chambers could not stifle the cries of so
many suffering wretches. The mamlukes heard,
and guessed their own impending fate. Immediately
they rose, stormed the batteries which surrounded
the sanctuary, and mastering their crested
summits, pointed its own cannon against the fortress,
and against the relentless tyrant, wading in
blood within its precincts.</p>

<p>Unable to make his escape without falling into
the hands of his enemies, Djezzar now plunged into
the deepest recesses of his treasury. There he shut
himself in with his hoards; and there, alone, and
without the smallest chance of any other mortal following
to assist or to defend him,&mdash;to bring him
intelligence or to take his orders,&mdash;he remained
stretched on his heaps of gold, in expectation of
every instant being discovered, and dragged out at
once to light and to death.</p>

<p>An hour was thus spent&mdash;by the mamlukes in
incessant firing, and by Djezzar in indescribable

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

anguish. That period elapsed, the fire of the assailants
began to slacken, and to leave longer pauses;
until by degrees the report of musketry entirely
ceased, and even the roar of cannon only was heard
at distant periods. At last all din of arms subsided
in a dead and awful silence. Djezzar no longer
doubted that the harem was forced, and the mamlukes
only employed in seeking the hidden entrance
of his last retreat. Every instant their approaching
footsteps seemed to vibrate nearer on his ear;&mdash;and
thus he spent another hour in still greater
agony than the first.</p>

<p>The continued tranquillity, however, now began
to cast upon his mind a gleam of hope. With
watchful ear and cautious tread he crept forth;&mdash;but
first only a few paces beyond the inmost vault:
by degrees a little further into the winding galleries;&mdash;and
at last unto the very verge of the forbidden
precincts. There, having again listened awhile at
the grated door, without being able to perceive any
sound, he ventured to open the ponderous jaws of
the iron gate, and finally, with breath suspended
and faltering steps, he again issued forth into the
realms of light.</p>

<p>Here, the various chambers of the harem were
the first he re-entered: but in them he only beheld&mdash;still
exposed to all the garish glare of day&mdash;the
mangled carcasses he had left. All was silent; and,
but for the pale corpses lying about, all was solitary.

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

No living being&mdash;neither foe nor domestic&mdash;presented
itself on the Butcher's way in these
his well-stocked shambles, until, bursting forth from
their inclosure, he all at once beheld, marshalled
in two long rows at its entrance and hailing him
with loud acclamations, his faithful Bosniaques.
This chosen band was the tyrant's bulwark against
the just wrath of his remaining subjects. Having
fallen on the mamlukes and forced them to retire,
its chiefs were waiting for their master's appearance,
to acquaint him with his safety, and the flight of
the rebels:&mdash;the greatest part of these ill-fated men
were afterwards slain in a pitched battle near Se&iuml;de.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Osman, Pasha of Damascus, had
died, and Mehemed, Osman's eldest son and successor,
had been poisoned by Derwish his younger
brother. Djezzar&mdash;possessed of more troops and
more money than Derwish&mdash;now bullied the Sultan,
and bribed the ministers into giving him the
investiture of that important government. Still,
however, only considering Damascus as a precarious
possession, and Acre as a sort of patrimony, the
Butcher continued to make the place of his creation
that of his habitual residence. His accession of
power only enabled him to pursue more steadily a
plan&mdash;long commenced upon&mdash;of weakening the
Deroozi into gradual and complete subjection. The
allegiance which the Emir owed him as Pasha of
Se&iuml;de, he made a pretence for interfering in all

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

the affairs of the country; and whatever schaichs
of Youssoof's family formed a cabal against their
chief, were always sure of support from Djezzar.
Long however did Youssoof, in spite of this insidious
conduct, forbear from open hostilities against
the lord to whom he owed allegiance; but at last he
found the only means to avoid ruin was to embrace
rebellion. He rose up in arms against Djezzar,
gave him battle, was defeated, and with the remnant
of his army fled into the fastnesses of the
Kesrowan, which had always preserved unimpaired
their loyalty to Melhem's son.</p>

<p>Djezzar offered the prince a free pardon, on condition
of suing for it at Acre. Youssoof left his
two sons Sad-el-din and Selim under the care of
his trusty Maronites, and with his old preceptor
Sad-el-koori, who still continued his adviser, went
to the Butcher's court. He was admitted, was
caressed at first, was soon found fault with, was
lured into a fresh semblance of mutiny, and with
his faithful tutor was condemned to death. In vain
the whole Kesrowan interceded for a beloved prince
and for a respected countryman. Djezzar never
forgave; and the prince and the tutor were led out
to meet their doom.</p>

<p>It is reported that on their way to the place of
execution, Youssoof, seeing all his fair prospects
end in a gibbet, could not refrain from reproaching
his aged counseller with having made him the

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

victim of his own ambitious views. "But for you,"
he exclaimed, "I might have died of old age!"
"Your father," answered the firmer Sad-el-koori,
"charged me to make you live a sovereign. I
may have erred in the means, but I too pay the
penalty. I asked nothing from you when in power;
I followed you when ruined; I accompany you in
death. What more could I do?"</p>

<p>The prince burst into tears; embraced, and
begged his tutor's pardon. They were hung side
by side from the part of Acre's wall which faces
Mount Lebanon;&mdash;and Youssoof's last dying look
fell on the blue mountains of his distant dominion.</p>

<p>During his persecution of Youssoof, Djezzar had
annexed to the pashalik of Acre the district of Saphad
by the assassination of Daher's sons, the
valley of Baalbe&iuml;t by the destruction of the Mootawelis,
and the territories of Tabarieh and C&aelig;sarea
by the expulsion of the Arabs of Sakr. One place
alone, in the very heart of Djezzar's new acquisitions,&mdash;the
poor and small district of Nabloos,&mdash;derided
all his efforts. Aboo-Djerrar its schaich&mdash;nestled
aloft in his inexpugnable castle of Sannoor&mdash;preserved
his independence amid his subdued
neighbours; and it is said that his sturdy resistance
gave Djezzar more pain than all his other successes
could afford him pleasure.</p>

<p>Djezzar had however now attained that degree
of power and independence, which induced the

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

Porte to send him alternately avowed favours and
concealed daggers. The former were all duly acknowledged,
and, by some unlucky chance, the
latter never reached their destination. Their bearers
disappeared, and, as usual, were no more inquired
after. At last a new device was struck out. According
to one of those ancient customs held more
sacred in Turkey than positive laws, the Pasha of
Trabloos, who on the pilgrims' return from Mekkah
brings them at a fixed place a supply of fresh
provisions, only enjoys the honours of the two horse-tails,
in order that his lesser rank may not clash with
the pre-eminence of the Emir-Hadj. The year
1794 beheld the first exception to this rule. Geretly
Husse&iuml;n, ex-Capitan Pasha and governor of Trabloos,
went to meet the caravan, preceded by three
tails. The circumstance looked suspicious. Djezzar
saw in Geretly a personage qualified to step into his
place. He determined to be beforehand with his
entertainer, and sent him a jar, properly sealed, of
the holy water from the well Zemzem. Geretly
drank&mdash;and died.</p>

<p>It was for the fifth time that Djezzar, in his quality
of Pasha of Damascus, conducted the holy caravan
to Mekkah, when, as related, he chose to defraud
of their dues the children of Anahs&eacute;. I have already
shown how they resented the injury, and how
the offending leader escaped the avenging blow, and
let it fall upon the innocent hadjees. Djezzar arrived

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

safe and sound at Damascus about the time I
reached Acre; but he made so short a stay in the
place, that, ere any one yet thought him near, he
entered his own sea-girt capital.</p>

<p>A bomb, bursting in the middle of its assembled
population, could not have spread at Acre a greater
dismay than did Djezzar's unexpected arrival. Immediately
every eye became fixed, every tongue tied,
and every limb motionless and paralysed, as if by the
force of a fascination. No one durst speak, or look,
or even listen: for the fate of all Djezzar's enemies,
taken one after the other from among the living,
made the vulgar believe in the supernatural powers
he affected; while the wise dreaded what supplied
the place of magic,&mdash;spies who informed him of
every thing, and agents who stopped at nothing.</p>

<p>For my own part, I no sooner heard in the evening
that the Butcher had come in at one gate, than
I prepared, a cripple as I still was, to take my departure
the next morning at the other. But even
this proved too great a delay. Just as I was slipping
my last parcel of diamonds into my belt, in
stepped a messenger of the Pasha, to summon me
before his master. I ran for my santon's cloak,
"Spare yourself that trouble," said the fellow;
"we know you well enough: wary eyes watched
your proceedings when at Khedieh you murdered
the wealthy Djiaffer, and plundered his rich equipage!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

<p>The most heinous part of this accusation certainly
laboured under the defect of falsehood. Still it
came too near the truth to leave me any hopes of
escaping through the chasm between the fact and
fiction; especially with Djezzar for my arbitrator.
The point therefore was, not to constitute him as
judge of the matter. With this view: "Your
name, pray?" said I to the messenger.&mdash;"What
can it signify?" cried he in answer.&mdash;"I ask it
as a favour;" replied I.&mdash;"Well then: Mustapha
Sakal;" surlily rejoined the messenger.</p>

<p>"Mustapha Sakal!" I now exclaimed; "you are
the very man I have been seeking. Know that,
before I approached the poor dear dying Djiaffer,&mdash;who
never was killed in his life&mdash;in order to
afford him in his misfortune what assistance I could
render, he said to me in an unintelligible voice:
'Generous stranger, you look so honest that I must
trust you with my last request. Seek among the
servants of the Emir Hadj for a youth of rare
merit, named Mustapha, for whom I always entertained,
unknown to himself, a particular regard;
and give him in my name this valuable jewel.' I
cannot doubt, O Mustapha Sakal! but you are the
person. So take the gem. But as the Emir Hadj
is unreasonable enough to constitute himself universal
legatee to all who die under his special protection,
assist me to make my escape, lest in my
dreams I should blab out your good luck."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

<p>The tchawoosh entered into the spirit of my tale,
even beyond my intention. "It can only be," said
he&mdash;taking the jewel without any ceremony&mdash;"from
the total failure of his memory that the worthy
Djiaffer asserted my ignorance of his regard for my
person, since, besides the bauble you gave me, he
promised me at his demise a hundred sequins, which
no doubt you will pay me with equal readiness."
"Truly;" answered I&mdash;fearful there might be no
end to the codicils&mdash;"he never mentioned the
sequins; nor have I them to give."</p>

<p>The tchawoosh hereupon grew insolent. "Look
in your belt," he cried, "and you will find them;"
at the same time laying his broad fist upon me,
and beginning to use violence. The question now
seemed whether it might not be expedient to do by
Mustapha, what I had <i>not</i> done by Djiaffer; and
while debating the thing in my mind, I at all
events grasped the dagger concealed under my
saint's cloak,&mdash;when all at once a loud noise was
heard at the door. It boded Mustapha as little
good as myself. Fearing that a second messenger
might come to supersede him in his office, he turned
as pale as ashes, and with a haggard look and
wild gesture: "Off"," he cried; "off to the mountains
this instant!" I waited not a second bidding.
Rushing by some person in the passage whom I
stopped not to look at, I was out of Acre in a trice,
and in less than an hour out of sight of its loftiest

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

towers;&mdash;having left my horse behind me as my
hostage.</p>

<p>All the remainder of the day was spent in making
the most of my way. Toward dusk I lay down
among some bushes, slept a few hours, and, while
the stars yet twinkled in the firmament, rose again,
and performed several leagues, ere the sun opened
to my right the purple gates of the morning. I
made such speed that its setting saw me clear of
Djezzar's dread dominions;&mdash;for, in recompense of
his last frolic, the Porte had just taken from him
the pashalik of Damascus, toward which I was
travelling.</p>

<p>The next day, two leagues only from its capital,
while pacing pretty smartly and quite wrapt up in
thought, I felt myself suddenly slapped on the back
by an arm of lead. Djezzar and his myrmidons
still haunted my imagination; and without looking
round, I set off at full speed, till a cry of "comrade,
whither scampering so fast?" made me stop
and face the enemy. He was not the most terrific
in the world; and only appeared in the shape of a
derwish with his sugarloaf cap, who laughed at my
panic most outrageously.</p>

<p>I laughed in my turn, and in this merry mood
we approached. "As one of the godly like myself,"
cried the derwish, "I was going to offer you hospitality
in our convent at Damascus." I readily accepted

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

an invitation which would prevent my being
seen in public, and we proceeded on together.</p>

<p>Entering a small village on the road, my companion
made a sudden stop. "Hark ye, comrade,"
said he; "a bright thought this minute strikes me.
We are so near our journey's end, that, without
a little management, we must stumble upon home
before we are aware of it. Let us therefore make
the most of what little time remains ours; particularly
as the sun is hot, and we have not, like the
prophet, a canopy of angels to shelter us from its
rays."</p>

<p>Upon this he lugged me, without waiting my
answer, into the house of a Syriac Christian, where
it seems he was well known. After saluting the
party within, he boldly called for an okka of the
best wine. I must have looked surprised, for he
added, "It is to rub my limbs with, and bad stuff
gives the cramp." The wine was brought, and set
before us in a little back room, safe from unwelcome
intrusion.</p>

<p>As soon as seated; "I have little faith," observed
our derwish, "in external applications: therefore,
O my soul!" added he in an emphatic tone, "bend
all your thoughts upon heaven, lest you share in
the defilement which, much against my will, I am
going to inflict upon my body." And hereupon,
carefully stroking up his whiskers, in order that

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

they too should avoid partaking in the sin of his
lips, he applied the vessel to his mouth, and most
devoutly began his internal ablution. For some
minutes he continued in this employment, with uplifted
eyes and an appearance of entire abstraction;
till at last I began to think that he and the jug
would part no more. This however finally happened,
but with a long protracted sigh; after which
he handed the half empty vessel to me. The santon
therefore easily finished what the derwish had begun;
and setting down the jar, I took up my staff
to march out.</p>

<p>This movement was still premature. Making the
most of time had, with my derwish, a more extensive
signification than I apprehended. "Not so fast,
brother," said he: "this place affords other gifts of
Providence beside the juice of the grape, which
man should not in his presumption contemn;" and
forthwith he went and whispered significantly to our
host, who upon the hint stepped out.</p>

<p>Faithful to his rule of making the most of time,
our derwish meanwhile fell mumbling his evening
orisons, in order that matters of business might all
be despatched ere our landlord returned; but this
diligence proved fruitless. The personage came
back empty-handed, throwing the fault on the vast
demands of the last caravan of pilgrims. The holy
satyr therefore had no further motive for delay, and
we proceeded on our way.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

<p>I could not help expressing some wonder, as we
went along, at his very open indulgence in profane
pleasures, marked as he was by his religious habit:
but the observation seemed only to excite his raillery.
"How you mistake my drift!" answered he,
with a pious sigh. "If I mix with sinners, it is
but to mend them; and how could this be done, if
I were to scare them by a premature severity of
manners?"</p>

<p>My companion's whole system of ethics seemed of
a piece with this small specimen. "It is your half
sinners only," he cried soon after, "who risk most
to find the gates of Paradise shut against them.
Carry the thing to its proper length, and the danger
subsides:&mdash;you then are sure of salvation."</p>

<p>This doctrine sounding new in my ears, I begged
an explanation. "Why!" exclaimed he, "is it not
the acting against one's conscience that alone constitutes
what is wrong, and leads to damnation?"&mdash;I
agreed.</p>

<p>"Then," replied he, "if you only sin on, until
habit has silenced that troublesome monitor, and
prevents your thinking any more about its qualms,
is it not as clear as daylight that you revert to a
state of perfect innocence?"</p>

<p>All I had to do was to regret that so incontrovertible
a truth should be so little understood: only
I took care&mdash;as my companion might possibly have
attained the degree of perfection he described&mdash;to

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

keep him in my eye during the remainder of the
journey; nor was I sorry to arrive at the convent,
where he introduced me in form to his brethren.</p>

<p>Whatever met my eyes in the monastery seemed
at first sight to breathe the very essence of holiness.
None of the derwishes walked otherwise than with
downcast eyes. Their domestics kept time in their
work with pious ejaculations; and the very cats of
the convent looked as if, like Mohammed's tabby,
they were constantly meditating on the perfections
of the koran. A word whispered by my travelling
companion in the ears of the superior speedily produced
an entire change of scene, and procured
me ocular demonstration of what small boundaries
divide saint and sinner. The minor gaieties of the
evening ended in a grand burlesque on the pious
ecstasies with which the order edified the public.</p>

<p>The sort of gravity which I could not help preserving
among scenes of grossness no longer to my
taste, was noticed, and appeared to give umbrage.
One of the derwishes taking me aside: "What
ails you, brother?" said he: "I thought we had
been sticks of the same bundle; but I know not
what to make of you. As we let ourselves out, you
draw in. Have we mistaken our man?"</p>

<p>I felt the danger of encouraging this idea. "By
no means;" answered I, rousing myself to look
sprightly. "My foot just now pains me a little. But

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

for that circumstance you would be astonished at
my mirth:" and immediately I poured out a volley
of bad jokes to prove my assertion. Still did I
most joyfully hail the dawn, which saw me safe out
of the tekkieh,<sup id="r290"><a href="#n290">290</a></sup> and again on the road. As I paced
along, I smiled to think I should have lived to feel
myself in danger, from being too demure.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> kaffl&eacute;<sup id="r291"><a href="#n291">291</a></sup> of Moslemen happened to be,
like myself, bound for Hems. I joined it, and in
my quality of santon acted as imam<sup id="r292"><a href="#n292">292</a></sup> to the party.
It was I who settled the whole business of the common
worship, took the lead in the prayers of my
companions, and chid those who appeared inattentive
in their devotions.</p>

<p>The city of Hems tempted me to take a few days
rest. Caravans from the most distant parts of the
empire, by making that place their thoroughfare,
give it an appearance of uncommon bustle. In the
bazar my santon's habit and practices collected
round me such a crowd, that the mootsellim thought
fit to inquire into my vocation. Little disposed
to answer his questions, I pushed him aside, and
darting forward&mdash;as if I saw something strange
which no one else beheld&mdash;prostrated myself two
or three times, and began to hold discourse with
vacant space. It was evident to all present that I
had visions; and the mootsellim began to be looked
upon by the mob with an eye of wrath, for wishing
to interrupt my converse with the world of spirits.
He therefore prudently ceased to interpose his word,

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

lest his voice should be silenced altogether, and
slunk away, muttering a few curses on all the saints
and santons that infested his district.</p>

<p>With the mootsellim had come the moollah of the
place. This latter looked significantly during the
interrogatory, but abstained from speaking. I felt
obliged to him for his discretion; and as soon as I
was rid of the importunities of the governor, went
and sat by the divine. "The fearful," said I to
him, in a gracious manner, "build aloof on the inaccessible
rock, but the secure mix with their brethren
in the valley." My meaning was understood,
and the moollah, to show that he felt his place to
be among the secure, began to let himself out.&mdash;"How
I envy you!" he exclaimed with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>I pointed to his costly fur, and to my ragged
cloak. "No matter!" rejoined he,&mdash;"sackcloth is
a bait for consideration full as much as silks: but
by being offered to the mob only, has procured you
more readily what you sought."</p>

<p>This speech made me wish to raise my character
in the moollah's estimation. I gave him a few traits
of my history, and he grew disposed in my favour.
His mind was stored with much information, and
hence it thirsted for more; while few of those he
lived with had a single idea to add to his stock.
The tenets and the views of the Wahhabees interested
him particularly. I employed the greatest
portion of my stay at Hems in giving him a description

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

of these sectaries. In return he favoured me
with a sketch of his own life.</p>

<p>"My father's humble roof," he said, "accidentally
afforded shelter from a storm to a magistrate
of high degree. On going away, the cazi-asker,<sup id="r293"><a href="#n293">293</a></sup>
in order to save a present, gave his host a
counsel. It was to send me to school, and to rely
on his patronage. Till then my worthy parent had
never boasted but of manufacturing good pipe-heads;
he now fancied himself destined to fabricate
a head of the law. His fortune was spent in placing
me in a medress&eacute;,<sup id="r294"><a href="#n294">294</a></sup> and my health ruined to do
credit to the situation. My examination took place
the same day with that of a dunce, descended from
so long a line of distinguished dunces, that he received
his degrees with unbounded applause for
having answered right a single question, while I
was near losing mine for answering a single interrogation
wrong. I was however qualified for promotion:
but, to render it the more acceptable, my
generous patron kept it back as long as possible;
or rather did nothing for me till his son wanted a
tutor. He then proposed the place to my necessities,
and soon they saw me the reluctant khodgea<sup id="r295"><a href="#n295">295</a></sup>
to the young bey-moollah;&mdash;for the child had been
aggregated to the college of muderrees<sup id="r296"><a href="#n296">296</a></sup> before he
knew his letters. It certainly was unnecessary for
him to learn them after. Yet somehow my stupidity
was several years in finding out the exceeding bad

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

compliment I paid the father, by requiring diligence
of the son. The mistake became evident, when, in
recompense for devoting to the service of an incorrigible
blockhead the best years of my life, I was
made cadee of a miserable country town. Since that
first step the promotion has proceeded at the slowest
rate our rules would admit of; and, too old now for
new advancement here below, I only look for further
promotion, where I wish my cazi-asker no
worse punishment than himself becoming a preceptor,&mdash;were
it an angel's family."</p>

<p>"Long may the sun still revolve," said I to the
moollah, as he finished his story, "ere you witness
the accomplishment of your wish! Long may your
wisdom still shine on the thousands of Hems!"</p>

<p>With these I tarried two days only, and then
pursued my way northward, through a smiling well
watered plain&mdash;thinking as I went along how dissatisfied
the wealthy and the great always were
with their lot. "Not so," added I mentally,
"the poor and the lowly;"&mdash;and to confirm myself
in my assumption, I stopped to congratulate a
passing peasant on the beauty and richness of his
country.</p>

<p>"Reserve your congratulations," answered the
clown surlily, "for the Mahwali Arabs: we sow, but
they reap. El-Korfan, their Emir, lays upon us
what contributions he pleases. The monopoly of
camels for all the caravans that cross Syria has

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

made him so rich and powerful, that he fears neither
governor of Haleb, nor Pasha of Damascus:
and why should he; who can at his pleasure bring
into the field his ten thousand well appointed
horse!"&mdash;Having growled out this speech, my informer
went on.</p>

<p>I had scarcely travelled two leagues farther, when
my good fortune made me stumble upon this formidable
schaich himself, just at that moment encamped
in the middle of the road. He too was out of humour
as well as the peasant. Numbers of his camels
had perished in the desert. But his frowns made
not the pilau in his tent look the less inviting.
"Let the Pasha of Damascus dread his ill temper,"
thought I; "his ten thousand horse dare not hurt
a hair of a houseless santon's head;"&mdash;and resolutely
I walked in, made my salam, and sat down
to the seasonable repast. Having refreshed myself,
I thanked the prince for his good cheer, and wishing
him and his remaining camels good health,
marched on to Hamah.</p>

<p>At Haleb, where I stopped next to purchase a
new steed, I inquired for the French <i>philosophe</i>,&mdash;the
worshipper of <i>l'utile</i>. Alas! the very annuity
granted to the director of his health on his own
precious life, had been the unfortunate cause of his
death. A becca-fico, swallowed too greedily bone
and all&mdash;lest the watchful servant should interpose
his veto&mdash;had in an evil hour stuck in the philosopher's

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

gullet, and choked him before the removal of
his first course.</p>

<p>Descending into the plain which leads to Antakieh,<sup id="r297"><a href="#n297">297</a></sup>
some Turkmen invited me to their camp. As
they were come all the way from Diarbeck their
country, to dispose of their cattle in the Syrian markets,
I thought I could not be far from the mark in
saluting them as shepherds. But I mistook the
thing completely: they were noblemen. The head
of the troop was regularly addressed by his followers
as Aga; and, on introducing me to the lady his
wife, who was churning her milk, surrounded by
the younger ladies his daughters, as actively employed,
the one in kneading a barley-cake, the other
in working a sheep's wool carpet, and the third in
darning her own camel's hair trowsers, he took an
opportunity of informing me, in his bad Turkish
dialect, of the antiquity of his race and the pure
nobility of his blood;&mdash;"a boast which he would
not have thought it necessary to make, but that
lately so many Christian peasants, fled from the
oppression of their Pashas, had assumed the name
of Turkmen, and brought it into disrepute, by
taking their revenge of their tyrannic governors on
the innocent traveller." I professed myself highly
delighted with the intelligence, and, after most respectfully
eating some cream cheese, and drinking
some buttermilk in the same respectful manner,
bade the exalted circle adieu, and went on. Every

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

step I performed increased my impatience to cast off
my rags,&mdash;but the time was not yet come.</p>

<p>At Antakieh I made a party with three merchants,
a jenissary, and some domestics, to go together to
Scanderoon; there to embark for Smyrna, the final
limit of my pilgrimage. The man of war was of
course to be our defender. I had nothing to do
but to pray, in my quality as santon, for Mahmood's
success,&mdash;and what could seem less doubtful than
that it must be most entire in whatever he undertook?
It did one's heart good only to hear from
his own lips&mdash;ere the journey was well begun&mdash;the
whole list of feats of bravery performed by his valiant
hand. When indeed, a little farther on the
road, a discussion arose with a few wandering Coords
who evinced some inclination to fleece us, our protector's
generous disposition got a little the better
of his martial ardour:&mdash;"Was it worth while squabbling,"
he asked, "about a few piastres, especially
with wretches whom, if it came to fighting, we could
not help annihilating?"&mdash;but though, on this occasion,
he deplored nothing so much as the valuable
time we lost in these debates, yet, when a mile farther
on our way a countryman informed us of a
more considerable detachment of the same tribe,
stationed in a defile between us and our intended
resting-place, he was most strenuous for stopping
altogether, and lying down where we were,&mdash;only
for the sake of coolness! However, seeing the merchants

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

determined to push on in spite of his raptures
with the place, he took me aside, and,&mdash;sagaciously
observing that in charging the enemy too vigorously,
his belt, in which he had all his money, might burst,&mdash;begged
of me in a whisper, as one protected by
my holiness, to take charge of his purse. Unfortunately,
in attempting to slip it unperceived into my
hand, the excessive courage which vibrated in his
own caused the bag to drop, and with such prodigious
clatter as to attract every eye. Mahmood
looked ready to faint: but I&mdash;very leisurely picking
up the purse,&mdash;immediately cried out: "The
deuce, I think, is in these leaden images,<sup id="r298"><a href="#n298">298</a></sup> which the
Damascus derwishes have given me for their Smyrna
brethren:&mdash;people will fancy I am made up of
gold!"&mdash;a speech which amused the merchants, who
thought the money mine, but positively enraptured
Mahmood, who thus escaped its being known as his.</p>

<p>I do not know what it was that&mdash;almost immediately
after this transaction&mdash;got wrong about my
saddle, and made me lag behind a little; but I do
remember that, when I called to my companions to
wait for me, the merchants thought it a clever joke
to spur on their horses, and to leave the good santon,
with his great bag of money, alone on the road. I
did not think it a very bad joke myself, and&mdash;determining
to leave those that left me,&mdash;while they
turned to the left, I turned to the right. I even
had the malice, when a little afterwards I caught a

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

distant glimpse of their procession&mdash;with Mahmood
closing the rear&mdash;just as they were entering the obnoxious
defile mentioned above, to fire a pistol; at
the report of which the whole troop set off as if possessed,
fancying all the Coords of Coordestan at its
heels,&mdash;and very soon entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Night coming on apace, I naturally missed my
way, and the next morning found I had considerably
overshot Scanderoon, which could now be distinctly
descried from the mountains. It would have been
madness to turn back&mdash;with Mahmood's purse in
my pocket, as well as without. So I went on, refreshed
myself at the nearest village, and there,
having made inquiries respecting the road, resolved
to give up all immediate thoughts of Smyrna, and
to strike into the courier's track to Constantinople,
from which I was not far distant. The capital, after
all, must be the place for converting my jewels into
gold. That weighty matter once accomplished, I
should take up my Alexis at Smyrna, in my way to
Christendom, where I intended finally to settle, and
to commence my new profession of an honest man.</p>

<p>I might have been travelling about five leagues
in my new direction, and had just got into the track
of the Tartar messengers, when, in fact, a personage
of that description passed by me with the customary
salute of peace. This I duly returned. Upon
which,&mdash;the sound of my voice striking the courier
as familiar to him&mdash;he looked round to survey me.

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

"Heavens!" cried he presently, "is it the lord
Selim I see in this strange attire?" "It is, Feiz-ullah,"
answered I,&mdash;who by this time had likewise
recognised my friend. He was no other than the
honest fellow who, at Bagdad, had cautioned me
against staying in that city, to wait the kehaya's
pleasure as to my head, and whom, in utter defiance
of all gratitude, I now wished at the devil for his
quicksightedness. "You see," continued I, "what
it is to have a timorous conscience. I felt so oppressed
with the weight of my sins&mdash;particularly
that of having lived so long among the Wahhabees&mdash;that
I begged of all the saints in paradise to assist
me in wiping out the stain. None heeded my prayer,
save Hadjee-Becktash,<sup id="r299"><a href="#n299">299</a></sup> who one night visited me in
my sleep, and bade me take his habit. As you may
perceive, it has extracted almost every impurity out
of my heart, and I shall soon come forth as spotless
as the new-born babe. Meanwhile, tell me what is
the news from Bagdad."</p>

<p>"Great," cried Feiz-ullah; "great indeed!&mdash;I
do not ask whether you remember your friend the
kehaya. Suleiman had toiled so many years to
give this faulty diamond a sort of false lustre, that
he felt loth to throw away his labour, and to own
his choice a bad one. Determined to leave a monument
of his might, he was too old to begin a new creation.
All the insinuations against Achmet therefore
were treated as the effects of sheer envy, until a day

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

when there came to hand a something passing hints;&mdash;a
packet from the Re&iuml;s-effendee, inclosing a letter
to the Porte in the kehaya's own hand writing. It
represented Suleiman as wholly superannuated;
and the child of his favour only modestly proposed
to set him aside, and to step into his place. On the
receipt of this document, a divan was immediately
convened of all the individuals hostile to the kehaya,
and the business laid before them. Suleiman wished
only to dismiss his old favourite; but being with
much difficulty rendered sensible of the danger of
this lenity, he at last reluctantly signed the kehaya's
doom. Scarce was the order issued, when Achmet
himself appeared. He suspected some plot against
his authority, and came to daunt his enemies. Suleiman
gave him the wonted reception, while the
kehaya, casting a look of rage round the astonished
circle, only seemed to count the new victims he
intended immolating to his safety. No time was
to be lost. Aly-khasnadar boldly rushes forward,
and strikes the first blow:&mdash;all the rest follow.
Dropping down on his knees, Achmet now raises
towards the Pasha his supplicating hands: but
the Pasha had thrown his shawl over his face, in
order not to see the impending execution, and in
an instant the favourite was despatched. His mangled
body, thrown out on the steps of the divan,
remained exposed till sunset to the greedy eyes of
the populace, and his head,"&mdash;added the Tartar,
pointing to a little bundle tied behind him,&mdash;"I

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

have here. As it has been carefully pickled, I entertain
no doubt of carrying it in very good condition
to our gracious sultan."</p>

<p>Feiz-ullah here stopping, I gave a deep sigh, not
so much in sorrow for what had happened, as from
regret that it had not happened sooner. It however
brought me some real advantage, in addition
to the pleasure afforded by the fall of an enemy.
Feiz-ullah, as a public messenger, every where found
horses ready at his command. It was more than
santons did. He proposed to me to go in his company;
and for the sake of sharing his privilege, I
determined to keep up with his pace.</p>

<p>The Tartar rate of travelling leaves little leisure
for a journal. The curiosities of the different cities
I was scarce allowed time to investigate; but I had
the best of every thing on the road. As to my companion,
he would not&mdash;even after the daintiest meal
in the world&mdash;forego the douceur he expected for
what he used to call the wear and tear of his teeth.
Once indeed his demand was resisted, in a malkyan&eacute;
of the Sultana Valid&eacute;, whose waywode swore
he would not part with a single aspre of his mistress's
slipper money, for all the booted Tartars in the
universe. Feiz-ullah had nothing to do but to
curse the sovereign's mother for an old toothless
jade as she was, without bowels of compassion.
Except on this single occasion, the Tartar's whip,
which never quitted his hand, was more powerful
than a sceptre;&mdash;it was an enchanter's wand: for,

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

if kings themselves lose their right where there is
nothing, this little instrument never failed to produce
something;&mdash;fat fowls, for instance, where a
hen had never cackled; sheep in good case, where
there was not a blade of grass; and nice fruit, where
not a vegetable could be made to grow. Alternately
applied with the same spirit to man and beast, its
persuasive powers made the most jaded horse go
on, and the most reluctant host supply an ample
meal.</p>

<p>At Isnik I took leave of my companion, and&mdash;with
all due respect for Hadjee-Becktash&mdash;of his
shabby uniform. As we travelled along I had gradually
collected all the articles of apparel necessary
for my transformation. Here, a rich stuff for a
turban; there, a handsome vest and cloak; farther
on, fine French cloth trowsers; elsewhere, papooshes
bright as burnished brass. With my parcel
under my arm I entered a house of entertainment,
engaged a snug back chamber, shut myself up,
slipped off at a single shake all my uncouth rags;
with impious hands shaved close my shaggy hair;<sup id="r300"><a href="#n300">300</a></sup>
nay, without giving them the smallest warning, disturbed
all the angels in my very beard,<sup id="r301"><a href="#n301">301</a></sup> and
maimed the lord knows how many tiny sprites,
deemed its tenants for life; made a bonfire of my
santon's cloak and staff; submitted my person to
all sorts of ablution, and, thus purified by fire and
water&mdash;after standing some time gazing in a state of

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

nature on the various articles of new apparel, methodically
laid out around me,&mdash;proceeded leisurely
to put on one by one the items of my new garb.</p>

<p>Stepping out of my cell after this refreshing process,
so completely metamorphosed as not to be recognised
even by the people in the shop, I truly felt
like the insect, which only casts off the unsightly
slough of the butterfly to come forth when older, a
gayer, gaudier, nay younger butterfly. The species
of ease and delight derived from my transformation,
positively baffles all my powers of description. My
chest seemed to dilate, my breathing to acquire a
freedom before unknown, and my limbs and gait to
have gained a fresh vigour and buoyancy. Though
now advanced to the wrong side of thirty, and
already beginning before to think myself grown old
and faded, I seemed to have dipped afresh in the
fountain of youth. Like the revolving year, after
passing through the decay of autumn and winter, I
had recovered anew all the smiling attributes of
spring.</p>

<p>The new companion with whom I engaged in
the coffee-house was suited to my new character,&mdash;a
young Algerine captain of a man of war, come
from Constantinople on business, and glad to have
me as a fellow traveller to return with to the capital.
We talked all the way; I, like all men already
somewhat advanced in life, praising times past;
while my companion would only laud in the present

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

tense. "Hold your tongue," cried he, "about
your great Hassan. Our little Husse&iuml;n" (Kootchook
was the new grand Admiral's by-name) "is worth
a dozen of him. We make more improvements in
the navy in a day now, than you used to do in a
twelvemonth. Husse&iuml;n sets about every thing at
once, has every new invention before it comes out,
never loses time in examining, and regularly new
models the arsenal from end to end every year. It
almost confuses one to see the builders he has collected
from every country: France, Sweden, and
whence not!&mdash;each speaking a different language;
each following a different method, and each pointing
out the faults of what all the others do. He
would sooner build in the Chinese fashion than
copy any one who went before him; and his designs,
when executed, will prove the finest in the
world! Every dock-yard in the empire,&mdash;Mytilene,
Rhodes, Boodroon, the Dardanelles, Sinope and
Galatsch&mdash;is vying with the rest which shall knock
up a ship of the line with the greatest speed; and
the capital prepares to launch a three-decker so
prodigious, that none of our seas will have room
enough to work her." I laughed at the eulogium;
wished my friend the command of this wonder, and
stepped into the boat which landed me at Constantinople.</p>

<p>My first care was to inquire after the merchant
who, at Khediuh, had so obligingly made me welcome

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

to his travelling equipage, for the mere trouble
of taking it. At Damascus I had understood him
to be gone to the capital: in the capital I found
that he had commenced the longer journey to
heaven. For not only he was departed this world,
but, in order to ensure a good reception in the next,
he had piously bequeathed all his property to an
hospital of cats and dogs, to the utter exclusion of
his nearer biped relations, expressly disinherited, and
in fact well able, as I heard, to spare his bequests. My
finances being by nature somewhat less brilliant than
those of the personages in question, I determined,
upon this information, fairly to keep what I before
thought I had acquired fairly, and on Djiaffer's own
express terms; assured that I did not even do his
four-footed legatees&mdash;only named by a disposition
subsequent to our meeting&mdash;an injury of which they
could reasonably complain. There were donanmas<sup id="r302"><a href="#n302">302</a></sup>
going forward in the capital; and the Porte, very
busy purchasing at all hands diamonds for presents,
afforded me an opportunity of selling part of mine
to a very great advantage, and still to reserve the
stones of the first water for what I deemed the
better markets of Vienna and Petersburg. Meantime,
informed that some of Djiaffer's cousins, less
fortunate than the remainder, had fallen into want,
I took upon myself to correct in their behalf their
kinsman's omissions, and by paying them, like a
good Moslemin, the tithe of my profit, restored

<!-- vol 3 page 285 -->

them to ease and comfort. After this I felt quite
at peace with my conscience for retaining what
certainly no other man breathing had any legal
claims upon;&mdash;nor even, in truth, the cats themselves.</p>

<p>On each occasion of my passing through Constantinople,
since my separation from Spiridion at
Chios, something or other had occurred to prevent
our meeting:&mdash;either my own fear of intruding; or
the apprehensions of my friend's other more officious
friends; or the subsequent absence of that friend from
the capital. I now made a fresh attempt to embrace
the companion of my youth&mdash;more regretted as I
grew older; and called upon the father, but could
not see the son. To the indescribable horror of all
his friends and relations, he was actually gone on a
voyage to the Venetian islands and to the other
parts of Christendom; and that, from motives of
mere curiosity, and without any views of advantage,
save instruction!&mdash;The best chance I had of finding
him was at Paris or in London.</p>

<p>Mavrocordato had a confidential friend;&mdash;a man
of weight and respectability, who, throughout all my
different vicissitudes, had constantly shown me a more
steady and uninterrupted interest than even Mavrocordato
himself, and while he never, it must be confessed,
had risen quite so high in his admiration of
my worth as the latter, never either fell quite so low
in his estimation of my qualities as signor Mavrocordato
had since chosen to do. I had particularly

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

noticed Costandino Caridi for one circumstance
in his conduct, in which he stood single among
his countrymen: namely, that, though far from
wealthy himself, he used to keep most aloof from
me, whenever I seemed to have the greatest command
of cash;&mdash;giving as his reason for this singularity,
that I never became bearable until I was
half starved. This old friend now met me with a
totally new face; for though he knew me to possess
the amplest means, he yet paid me a degree of attention
which I had never before been able to extort
from him, even when my situation was most
forlorn. In fact, he seemed so very determined to
obtain complete possession of my mind by every
species of address and flattery, that at last I grew
distrustful of him whom I had never distrusted
before, and conceived that, through daily society
with men of a selfish and intriguing disposition, his
own character had at last suffered an entire change.
One day, indeed, I could not help telling him so
in direct terms. Sick of his obsequiousness, and
quite out of patience with his compliments, I ironically
begged of him not to waste his breath in flattering
one who himself felt so impressed with his unparalleled
perfection, as to consider all attempts at
praise as inadequate, and to loathe every other
compliment paid to him to his face, except that
addressed to his good sense, in sound and well-timed
abuse.</p>

<p>At this speech signor Caridi, instead of looking

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

somewhat confused as I expected, began to laugh
most immoderately; and forcibly taking me by the
hand: "Bravo!" he cried; "this is at last as I
wished it. I now have hopes, and shall report
accordingly. My commission need no longer be
deferred."</p>

<p>"Your commission?" I echoed.</p>

<p>"You remember," resumed Costandino, "the
kinsman of Trieste, who so cruelly left you in the
lurch at Smyrna?"</p>

<p>"I do," was my reply&mdash;"and as an egregious
rogue."</p>

<p>"That is precisely," answered Caridi, "the thing
he understood <i>you</i> to be; and the attribute which
made him transfer his views from the son of his
relative Sotiri, to another youth&mdash;an entire stranger
to his blood, but who had been a clerk in his counting-house,
and seemed to bear himself as a lad of
unexceptionable morals. Unfortunately, poor Elevtheri
was not as sound in constitution as in principles;
and when your cousin, adopting him as his
son, thought it necessary to coax him into being his
intended heir, the hapless youth had to undergo
such excessive petting, and care, and exclusion from
those fresh gales which he used formerly to inhale
unrestrained, that the first draught of air he encountered
after this change of system became a
gale of death to him. Delvinioti, now again adrift,
wrote to me to make fresh inquiries after his

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

worthy cousin Anastasius, in order that, should
age, or disappointment, or other desirable circumstances
have produced wholesome fruits in his bosom,
new proposals might be made to him, on the old
conditions. The letter which I received to this
purpose is dated six months back; and I confess
my hopes of ever seeing you again were so
slender, that I was going to answer it as relating
to a desperate business&mdash;when suddenly you reappeared.
Since that period I have neglected no opportunity
of watching your conduct, and trying
your temper: and you yourself must do me the
justice to own that I have laid every trap in your
way which my imagination could suggest. I therefore
now begin to think mere time has done enough,
to warrant my expecting from motives so powerful
as a respectable situation and a rich inheritance, all
that still remains to be achieved; and I hesitate no
longer to stamp your improvement with the mark of
your cousin's splendid offer."</p>

<p>"Or rather," cried I, "to submit my prudence to
some fresh and arduous trial&mdash;in order to ascertain
whether I am weak enough to be deceived a second
time by the same wily relation, and can be made to
perform another journey longer than the first, only to
look at the conclusion like a more egregious fool."</p>

<p>"Right!" exclaimed Caridi, "you are fully warranted
to form such a surmise; and therefore, as a
security against its being realized, I see nothing for

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

you to do, but to take this letter of credit to defray
your expenses. It includes, as you see, every place
on your way up the Adriatic, and ends with Trieste.
Thus, should you and your cousin after all not suit
each other, you will have been franked during a
pleasant voyage, and treated with a peep at Christendom,
which at any rate I understand you meant
to visit."</p>

<p>I had indeed occasionally thrown out some idea
of the kind, as a thing which might be of advantage
to my child's education; but, when directly called
upon to decide whether I chose to sit down for life
in distant realms, to whose habits and manners I
was a perfect stranger, I recoiled from the thought,
and for a while kept turning a deaf ear to Caridi's
remonstrances. At last he set in so strong a light
the expediency, in my situation, of retiring to Franguestan,
both for the purpose of securing my fortune
to my son, and for that of providing that precious
child with the best instruction, that I suffered
myself to be persuaded, and resolved, after taking
up my Alexis at Smyrna, gradually to work my
way out of the precincts of Islamism, and into those
where soars the cross. I deposited the letter of
credit in my pocket-book, converted my cash into
bills on the best houses, and prepared for my journey.
Unfortunately an illness which awaited me the very
moment I had leisure to attend to my health, and a
stab which, when convalescent, I received one night

<!-- vol 3 page 290 -->

in a mistake, detained me about eight months longer,
ere I was able finally to set out.</p>

<p>All things being ready at last for my departure
from Stambool, I ascended the hill crowned by
Noor-Osmany, and seeking the loftiest galleries of
this superb building, took a last parting view of the
proud capital which I had made the first scene of
my youthful revels, which, during the fairest portion
of my life I had considered as my home, and
which I was now probably going to quit for ever.
For the last time my eye, moistened with tears,
wandered over the dimpled hills, glided along the
winding waters, and dived into the deep and delicious
dells in which branch out its jagged shores.
Reverting from these smiling outlets of its sea-beat
suburbs to its busy centre, I surveyed in slow succession
every chaplet of swelling cupolas, every
grove of slender minarets, and every avenue of glittering
porticoes, whose pinnacles dart their golden
shafts from between sombre cypress groves into
the azure sky. I dwelt on them as on things I was
never to behold more; and not until the evening
had deepened the veil cast over the varied scene
from a bright orange to purple, and from purple to
the sable hue of the night, did I tear myself away
from the beloved spot. I then bade the city of
Constantine farewell for ever, descended the high-crested
hill, stepped into the heaving boat, turned
my back upon the shore, and sunk my regrets in

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

the sparkling wave, across which the moon had
already flung a trembling bar of silvery light,&mdash;pointing
my way, as it were, to other regions yet
unknown.</p>

<p>During the whole of my voyage to Smyrna, one
only thought kept possession of my soul. It was
the rapture which awaited me on landing, in pressing
to my bosom my darling child. Four years
and a half had now elapsed since his joyless birth:&mdash;he
must be grown full of grace, loveliness, and
artless prattle; heir to all the charms of his mother,
and ready to return all the endearments of his
father: and such became, on stepping on shore, my
impatience to behold the fond object of these daily
dreams, that it scarcely left me patience to go with
composure through the tedious forms and functions,
from which none are exempt who transfer their persons
and goods from the watery element to a firmer
footing on land.</p>

<p>When indeed, after traversing the busier parts
of the city around the quay, I arrived at that remote
and lonely suburb, where all my affections would at
last be crowned, and which, but for my melancholy
search after my lost Euphrosyne, I might never
have visited, or at least, have remembered:&mdash;when
I passed by the obscure hovel which I entered while
my lovely victim was praying on her death-bed for
a last farewell from her frantic destroyer; which I

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

left without seeing her; and where she resigned her
spotless soul to heaven,&mdash;fresh clouds of despair
seemed for a moment to overcast the sunshine of my
hopes; and the solace of the son was forgotten in the
woes of the mother: or rather, I felt that after losing
the parent as I did, I deserved not to find the child:&mdash;but
this gloom again subsided when I beheld the
abode where I had left my Alexis.</p>

<p>It was only on its threshold that my delightful
vision at last vanished entirely. There I first heard,
and from strangers, not only that the merchant
entrusted with the small pittance for my child's
support had become a bankrupt, and had disappeared,&mdash;but
that even the woman, in whose care I
had left my darling babe, had absconded. Nobody
could give me the least information respecting
herself or her charge; nor&mdash;what seemed the
strangest part of the story&mdash;did distress or failure of
the promised supplies appear to have been her motive;
for so far from leaving to any succour the
smallest chance of reaching its destination, she had
evidently taken pains to baffle all inquiry respecting
the place of her concealment. Had Sophia still enjoyed
the breath of life, I should&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; But she
was gone to her doom! Yet might her evil spirit
still haunt the scene of her infernal wickedness.</p>

<p>Once, on my homeward journey from the eternal
desert&mdash;oppressed with heat, and in vain soliciting

<!-- vol 3 page 293 -->

my cruise for a last drop of water to wet my parched
lips&mdash;I had, when on the point of fainting with exhaustion,
beheld in a valley before me the semblance
of a limpid lake, ready to slake my raging thirst and
to lave my wearied limbs; had collected my last
strength to reach its winding banks, and, when
near the delusive spot, had found the lying vision
exchanged for no other reality but sands more dry
and burning than the sands already traversed: but
what was this disappointment of the sense,&mdash;even
with life at stake&mdash;compared with that which struck
my inmost soul at this dreadful moment!&mdash;for the
anguish of the actual shock was still exceeded
by the gloom of my forebodings; since it seemed
that no other motive could have made the person
I sought take pains to evade my inquiry, but
having made away with, or abandoned my child.
Probably it had long ceased to exist; long probably
had my Alexis followed his hapless mother to the
grave; and, while I was conjuring up in my busy
fancy every brightest image of his beauty and his
sprightliness, his lifeless form was already changed
to dust: or, if he still was permitted to breathe in
common with the meanest of insects, on this vile
inhospitable earth, it could only be to experience
sufferings worse than death;&mdash;every pang of illness,
of desertion, and of want. The least untoward fate I
dared imagine for the relic of my adored Euphrosyne

<!-- vol 3 page 294 -->

was that of begging his bread like a wretched
orphan from door to door. Even his father might
have met him without knowing whom he met;&mdash;might
have bestowed on his own babe the scanty
boon of common and churlish charity!</p>

<p>Impressed with this idea, I examined with anxious
solicitude every child on which fell my searching
eye: stopped to inquire into its parentage and
birthplace; and suffered no little creature under
five or six years of age to escape, until it had passed
through the regular ordeal of my interminable
questions: but no child I beheld resembled my
Alexis; none made my heart bound on meeting its
first glance. "Ah!" was now my constant cry:
"why had I ever lost sight even for an instant of
that heart's only remaining treasure?&mdash;Why had
I roamed far from the humble abode in which
centered all my joys? Would it not have been
better a thousand times to possess my child, without
bread to eat, than all the riches of the universe
without my darling child?"</p>

<p>At last a faint ray of hope broke in, and threw
a gleam of light upon my dark despondency. It
dimly showed my mind a track to pursue, though
it marked not its issue. Indeed so vague, so faint,
so flitting remained the forms which it here and
there pointed out, that I feared to trust to them as
to realities. A Smyrniote lady, who had witnessed

<!-- vol 3 page 295 -->

my distress, and had even assisted me in my inquiries,
sent to inform me of a circumstance which
she had heard by accident. The wife of a foreign
consul at Alexandria, on a visit the year before
with a friend at Smyrna, was said on her return to
Egypt to have taken with her, in the capacity of
waiting-woman, a person intrusted by a stranger
with a child of such singular beauty, that the consuless,
unblessed with a family of her own, rather
considered the unprotected babe as a prize than as
an encumbrance. Further particulars to identify
the child could not be collected at Smyrna, and
rather than engage in a tedious and ineffectual correspondence
with Alexandria, I resolved immediately
to embark for that well known place.</p>

<p>Walking impatiently backward and forward on
the quay, while the boat was getting ready, I spied
a large circle of townspeople gathered round a
jenissary, employed in telling a tale of wonder. It
was no other than the recital of the innumerable
Coords killed by the valiant Mahmood, in defending
a certain purse which I was prevailed upon to
pocket on the road to Scanderoon, and which I still
happened to have in my possession;&mdash;nor need I
add, that Mahmood himself was the relater of
his own achievements. At this instance of shameless
bragging I could not resist slipping behind
the dauntless hem, and whispering in his ear:
"Coward, you lie; here is the object of your

<!-- vol 3 page 296 -->

vauntings, undiminished; and claim it if you dare!"&mdash;upon
which, throwing the purse down before its
rightful owner, I folded my arms in each other,
and waited some little time to see what step he
would take:&mdash;but he only stood still, speechless and
pale as a ghost, looking alternately at the money
and at me, until, giving up all hopes of his uttering
a syllable, I flung the purse to a beggar, and
stepped into the boat.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Behold</span> me now for the third and last time on
my passage to Egypt; a country which, after having
been visited successively by famine, plague, and the
Capitan-Pasha, had, to crown its misfortunes, been
left at last divided between Isma&iuml;l, Schaich-el-belled
at Cairo, and Ibrahim and Mourad, masters of the
Sa&iuml;d:&mdash;an arrangement which increased the expenses
of the chief in the same proportion in which
it diminished his income; since it fixed on his very
boundary an enemy, against whom it was necessary
always to keep his province prepared. Fortunately
Isma&iuml;l's abilities were equal to his task. By his
firmness he awed the open hostility of the party in
Upper Egypt, and by his vigilance he defeated the
treachery in his own councils: he made the heavier
burthens which he was forced to impose seem lighter
by causing them to bear more equally on all classes:
he applied himself with equal skill to curing wounds
inflicted, and to obviate impending evils; and,
finally, he carried from the mountains of Lybia to
the city of Cairo a line of walls, which frowned defiance
on the undisciplined troops of the Beys in
the Sa&iuml;d.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 298 -->

<p>After these labours, Isma&iuml;l seemed, in 1790, to
have nothing further left to do but to sit down,
and to enjoy the fruits of his arduous toil, when
that scourge of the east, the plague, imperfectly
subdued, broke out afresh with a virulence far
exceeding its former fury. From the close-wedged
hovels of the poor it soon reached&mdash;more ravenous
in proportion as it found richer food&mdash;to the spacious
palaces of the great, and spread dismay and
death among the haughty mamlukes, as it had
done among the humble natives. At last it penetrated
into the abode of the Schaich-el-belled himself,
and struck its venomed dart at the chief, while
in the very act of concerting measures to stem its
devastations. In the midst of all his glory Isma&iuml;l
fell a prey to the contagion,&mdash;and a few hours saw
him dragged from the pinnacle of power to the
brink of the grave.</p>

<p>But the disease which conquered his body could
boast no victory over his mighty soul. To the
last his mind continued intent upon the welfare of
Egypt. Finding his end draw near, he cast his
eyes around, to seek among his followers a fit successor,&mdash;one
able to support, at his fall, the fabric
raised by his genius. Summoning all his friends
for the last time into his presence, he offered the
reversion of his dignity successively to Hassan-bey
Djeddawee, to Aly-bey Defterdar, and to all his

<!-- vol 3 page 299 -->

other veterans, whose abilities or power seemed
equal to the task.</p>

<p>But no one dared to face it. Deprived, by the
same scourge under which their chief was sinking,
of their most faithful adherents, these ambitious
leaders, who at other times would have steeped
their swords in blood for Isma&iuml;l's rich succession,
now wholly unnerved, were compelled one by one
to decline the tempting honours, when, spread out
before their eyes, these coveted grandeurs only
waited their acceptance. The supreme rank therefore
devolved on the very last of those to whom
the offer was made,&mdash;on Isma&iuml;l's own creature
Osman, surnamed Toobbal; a youth as crooked in
mind as he was distorted in body: but who alone
with alacrity accepted what all the others with deep
regret refused.</p>

<p>Wishing to give a last instance of his power, or
rather, to render manifest to all men breathing the
last act of his authority, Isma&iuml;l commanded the
proclamation of Toobbal to take place while he
himself still had life. From his death-bed he heard
his successor announced; and gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>Toobbal had accepted the dignity of Schaich-el-belled,
which he was conscious he could not maintain,
only to sell it to the Beys in the Sa&iuml;d. He
sent them speedy advice of the death of Isma&iuml;l, and
of the utter debility of his party. On this welcome
intelligence they immediately descended along the

<!-- vol 3 page 300 -->

western bank of the Nile; but, startled by the unlooked
for and new fortifications which they found
at Dgiz&eacute;, they retraced their steps backward, until
they could collect sufficient craft to cross the river;
and, on the reverse of the chain of Arabic mountains
again redescended with such rapidity, that scarce
had the Beys of Cairo received intelligence of their
retreat from before Dgiz&eacute;, when they rushed from
behind the Mokhadem, and summoned the capital to
surrender.</p>

<p>At this appalling intelligence, the Beys marched
out with what force they could muster, headed by
the traitor Toobbal. He seized the first opportunity
of passing over to the enemy, and led his new friends
triumphant into the capital, while his former party
fled to the Sa&iuml;d. There the remnant of Aly-bey's
creations and of Hassan Pasha's tools reluctantly
fixed its quarters, and there its now oldest relic,
Djeddawee&mdash;suffered to resume his ancient government
of Es-souan&mdash;has since been left undisturbed
to reflect on his singular fate:&mdash;a fate ever intent
upon rendering the bravest of a fearless race, celebrated
only through his flights. Toobbal, who immediately
abdicated his recent honours in favour of
his new competitors, soon attained the oblivion he
deserved; while the country to the south of Cairo
was allotted to Ibrahim, and the regions lying northward
of the capital fell to the share of Mourad.</p>

<p>The person who gave me this account was a

<!-- vol 3 page 301 -->

middle-aged Greek of singular appearance, whom I
met on my way at Cos. Fresh arrived from the
country whither I was bound, he had excited my
curiosity by his consequential manner. On some
slight offence given him in one of the coffee-houses
under the gigantic plane-tree in the market-place:&mdash;"Is
this a treatment," he cried, trembling with
rage, "for a Capitan-Pasha?"&mdash;at which words I
started, and, after considering the personage for
some time with increased wonder:&mdash;"Capitan-Pasha!
To whom, I beseech?" was the question
which I could not help proposing.</p>

<p>"To Mourad-bey, to be sure," was the unexpected
answer.</p>

<p>"In order to maintain a Lord High Admiral,"&mdash;I
ventured to observe,&mdash;"one should have at least
the shadow of a navy."</p>

<p>"And who has its showiest substance," rejoined
my informer, "if Mourad has not? His fleet rides
at anchor under his very windows at Dgiz&eacute;; is the
best appointed within an hundred miles of the sea;
and, when the Nile has attained its full height, sails
up as high as Boolak, and down as low as Fostat.
At other times indeed it remains properly moored
along the quay of the palace, for fear of running
aground in the river."</p>

<p>"Equal to its own merits, no doubt, were the
naval achievements which raised you to the honour
of commanding this formidable squadron?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 302 -->

<p>"As you may suppose.&mdash;When Osman-bey
Tamboordjee grew tired of the banishment which
Hassan procured him to Stambool, I, Nicola-Hadjee
of Tchesm&eacute;, was the man who conveyed him to
Derneh, whence he easily regained his home. This
signal service recommended me to his party, and
made Mourad give me the command of his naval
force, as soon as he learned my transcendent abilities.
Unfortunately I was tenacious of the privileges
attached to my high office, and one day battered
a kiashef's windows for protecting a runaway
sailor. This spirited act brought me into disgrace,
and, like other great people, I now travel for a
change of air."</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure," replied I, "to find that
the rage for novelties is not confined to Constantinople."
I however condoled with the ex-Capitan
Pasha on his dismissal, and, having filled a bag
with the fine bergamots of the island miscalled
Stanchio, reimbarked for my destination.</p>

<p>On the coast of Syria the re&iuml;s took on board,
much against my advice, two Latin friars,&mdash;the one
an Italian from the convent of Jerusalem, and the
other a Spaniard from the hospice at Ramleh.</p>

<p>If they had been Greeks they could not have
quarrelled more unceasingly. Under the delusion
that no one understood their idiom, they were
constantly refreshing each other's memory with all
the little peccadilloes of their respective establishments.

<!-- vol 3 page 303 -->

"The convent of Jerusalem had suffered
the schismatics to invade all the sanctuaries; the
hospice at Ramleh had bribed the Arabs to plunder
the pilgrims: the monks of the former place set
their blood on fire with drams; those of the latter
with pimento and quarrels."</p>

<p>That&mdash;whatever might be the cause&mdash;the humours
of these representatives of their respective
communities were actually in a state of high fermentation,
no one could deny. More than once I
expected an explosion, such as should end fatally
for both. Luckily breath only&mdash;not blood&mdash;was
wasted; and we had the satisfaction to land both
fra. Diego and fra. Giacomo, sound in body, though
very sore in mind, on the quay of Alexandria.</p>

<p>My feet had not yet pressed the long looked-for
shore, when I began to inquire for the consular
mansion in which centered all my hopes. With
trembling steps and throbbing heart I hied me to
its threshold. A vague report, an idle story might
have deceived me: I might have gone away from
the child I came to seek; and, when near the door,
I was on the point of turning back, in order yet a
while to defer the inquiry, and to gather more fortitude
for an answer, which must bring with it either
inexpressible happiness or bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>Apprehensive lest the sight of a stranger in the
Turkish garb might alarm the family, I first gave
a gentle knock. No one answered:&mdash;I then repeated

<!-- vol 3 page 304 -->

the summons. A domestic at last appeared,
"Both his master and mistress were out," he said;
"and it was uncertain when they would return."</p>

<p>"Had they a child with them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There was a child in the house."</p>

<p>"Found at Smyrna,&mdash;and belonging to a
stranger?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! brought up in the family by its own
mother."</p>

<p>This seemed to dash all my hopes to the ground!
However, "might I see the little boy?" I again
asked.</p>

<p>He too had been taken out to walk.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"It was impossible to tell."</p>

<p>Perplexed, I now left word I would call again,
and withdrew from the door in deep despondency.
Yet, when I reflected that the servants might be
strangers to the concerns of their masters, and these
latter not desirous to own their little favourite a
foundling, I did not entirely despair. I paced up
and down the road in sight of the mansion, to watch
the coming home of the boy.</p>

<p>Nor was I long without descrying at a distance a
child approaching, whose dress belonged not to the
country. A female held it by the hand; but from
<i>her</i> my very first glance recoiled as from a total
stranger&mdash;one who bore not the least resemblance
to the nurse of my Alexis.</p>

<p>"It cannot be he!" sighed I to myself;&mdash;and yet,

<!-- vol 3 page 305 -->

so playfully did the little fellow trip along, so erect
was his gait, and so noble his mien,&mdash;with so lively
and inquisitive a manner did he stop to survey each
new object on his way,&mdash;that I envied his too happy
parents, and could immediately have given up all
paternal claims elsewhere, for a good title in the
treasure before me. "Ah!" thought I, "had this
angel been my own!"&mdash;But as he drew nearer, as
by degrees I discerned more of his countenance and
features, as I became enabled more distinctly to
trace the outline of his radiant front, of his dimpled
downy cheek, and of his coral lip,&mdash;as above all
he himself, with a look at once arch and innocent,
fixed upon me his full bright eye&mdash;that eye which
disclosed the whole heaven of his heart,&mdash;O God!
O God! all Euphrosyne at once burst upon my
sense; entire conviction in an instant filled my
mind. I felt it must be,&mdash;it <i>was</i> my own Alexis:
I beheld my own babe!</p>

<p>Unable to repress my emotion, I darted forward,
and was going to seize upon my treasure,&mdash;when the
woman, who already from a distance had noticed
my eager look, and had made a circuit to avoid my
approach, snatched up the child, and, alarmed at
my frantic manner, ran screaming to the house.</p>

<p>Fearful of increasing her fright, I purposely
slackened my pace, and gave her time to gain admittance,
ere I followed her lovely charge to the
door: but in spite of this forbearance, I found not

<!-- vol 3 page 306 -->

the less its bolts shot against me. No entreaty,
however earnest, could obtain their unsheathing.
"Strangers" was the plea, "never were admitted
when the consul was abroad." I was not even
allowed&mdash;hard as I begged for the trifling boon&mdash;another
view of my Alexis from without. "What
business could I have with the child? An evil
eye, or an evil intent, must with reason be apprehended:"
and lest I should by my urgency confirm
the growing distrust, I at last retired. But I had
beheld my boy; and the tumult in my breast, though
extreme, was a tumult of bliss!</p>

<p>As soon as, by my calculation, the consular pair
must be come home, I called again. After a little
parleying within, of which I could not guess the
drift, I was told I might see the lady.</p>

<p>This promised well.&mdash;"For the wife to be appointed
my interlocutor"&mdash;thought I,&mdash;"she must
know my business, and have made up her mind to
acquiesce in my right." I was ushered into a back
chamber, where however so many attendants crowded
in close after me, that it looked as if they either intended
or expected some violence.</p>

<p>Presently walked into the room a stately matron,
who, disdaining to be seated, and of course keeping
me standing, asked with a sort of lofty civility in
what she could oblige her unknown visitor; but,
when informed, affected the utmost amazement at
my demand. "She was wholly ignorant of the

<!-- vol 3 page 307 -->

circumstances alluded to,&mdash;had no stranger's offspring
under her roof. The little boy I met was
the son of her own servant:&mdash;the mother, marrying
again, had left him in her care; and she had no
knowledge of any other child. As to the Smyrna
transaction, on which I founded my claim, it must be
the invention of some idle person, or the report of
some enemy." In a word, my Alexis was refused me,
and the humblest supplication could not even obtain
for a trembling father the permission to give his child
one single embrace. It was feared I might cast
some spell upon the boy. "In fact"&mdash;it was observed&mdash;"I
might have done so already:" and presently
the lady, affecting apprehensions for her own precious
safety, hastily withdrew, while her servants
peremptorily urged me not to protract my intrusion.</p>

<p>Even I, at the moment, saw no advantage in
staying; for, whether the consuless believed her
own story or not, it was plain that she had framed
it with deliberation, and meant to support it with
boldness. Any remonstrance on my part could
therefore only redouble her caution, and perhaps
give me the appearance of temerity,&mdash;nay, be construed
into an act of violence. It was wiser that I
should appear to submit, till I had acquired a
little more local information of the personages and
circumstances, and had armed myself with such
proof, not only of my right to a child I had lost,
but of its identity with the child I had found,

<!-- vol 3 page 308 -->

as could not be resisted, either with justice, with
reason, or with safety. Meantime I retired for the
present,&mdash;but full of dismay, doubt, and disappointment.</p>

<p>Invited by a stone that lay on the road-side, I
sat down&mdash;to ruminate upon what had occurred.
"After all,"&mdash;was the first reflection which passed
through my mind&mdash;"may not my excessive wish to
find my child have deceived me? May I not have
cause to distrust my own imagination, rather than the
veracity of others? So vague were the reports which
had brought me to Alexandria, so perfectly did my
fears always balance my hopes, so little could I at
any time have been justified in laying the least stress
on my expectations, that, with an indifferent person
addressed as I had been, the account of the consuless
would have found implicit credence: and only
because I was not sufficiently unconcerned in the
business impartially to weigh the evidence on both
sides; because I could only bear to dwell upon such
circumstances as seemed to favour my own hopes;
because the child I had met presented a resemblance&mdash;anxiously
sought in whatever infant I beheld&mdash;to
the bright image impressed upon my mind, did I
persevere thus to consider myself certain of what
others would have long begun to doubt&mdash;or rather&mdash;would
have ceased to believe.</p>

<p>"But was that resemblance itself, on which I thus
boldly built my conviction, so great as it appeared

<!-- vol 3 page 309 -->

to my unbounded eagerness?&mdash;Beauty alone surely
could not make it so. However heavenly a child of
Euphrosyne ought to be, it still was not the only
child on this globe, entitled to bear the countenance
of a cherub!&mdash;and, as to any other more definite
conditions of similitude, they could hardly yet be
said to exist in a very striking degree, in the still
vague and uncertain lineaments of childhood; particularly
where their very symmetry was such as to
prevent any decisive identifying peculiarity. However,
supposing even the likeness to have been as
great as it was possible to conceive; how often is such
resemblance found to be the mere effect of chance!</p>

<p>"Should then"&mdash;continued I&mdash;"this single circumstance
be allowed to outweigh the solemn assertions
of people, holding a respectable rank in society,
and a conspicuous situation in the place; of people
not seemingly interested to disgrace themselves by a
tale of fraud, and, though taken wholly by surprise,
yet agreeing perfectly in their account with that
which their servants had given before them?&mdash;especially
when the female I found about the child,
instead of being the nurse whom I left with my
babe, and whom an idle report had placed about
the consuless as her own attendant, was a totally
different person."</p>

<p>Here my reason, having urged all it could think
of to check my imagination, ceased its remonstrances:
but spite of its arguments, my feelings
would not be convinced. When with the report

<!-- vol 3 page 310 -->

spread at Smyrna, and with the consuless's own
acknowledgment that a woman no longer in the
family was mother to the child, I combined an indescribable
something in the look and manner of
all concerned, which bespoke them to be acting parts
rehearsed before; and above all,&mdash;when I reflected
upon those internal yearnings which, first and only
felt, among all the children I had seen, in favour of
this angel now so near me, could only be considered
as the cry of the blood, I still persisted in my former
belief, and resolved to set on foot, as soon as I had
secured a shelter for my own person, the most minute
and circumstantial perquisitions.</p>

<p>My inquiries were chiefly carried on among the
neighbours and tradesmen who, from their situation
and concerns, must be best acquainted with the
consul's family and domestics&mdash;and this was the
result:&mdash;</p>

<p>Neither the child nor its pretended mother had
been known in Egypt previous to the lady's return
from Smyrna. The person who called herself, but
who had never obtained credit for being the real
parent of the beauteous infant, had very soon after
her arrival again quitted the consular mansion, to
marry and to follow to his native island a taooshan;
and the little stranger, left behind, had continued
not the less to experience in the consular family
such truly parental tenderness, as to render evil
tongues first busy with the name of the consul, and
at last with the fair fame of the consuless herself.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 311 -->

<p>Mine was a conclusion which affected the honour
or virtue of either party in a very different point of
view. When, in addition to the circumstances here
mentioned, I moreover reflected upon the description
of the pretended mother, and found how accurately
it tallied with that of the woman entrusted with
my Alexis at Smyrna, I became confirmed in my
original belief, and no longer retained the smallest
doubt of two things: firstly, that the child was my
own, and secondly, that the consul and his wife
had fully intended that I never should recover it.
Determined in some way to obtain a treasure which
nature had denied them, they had stooped to steal
the offspring of another; and, having already set at
defiance both the tongues of slander and the voice
of truth, it could not be doubted but that they were
fully resolved to go any lengths in support of their
imposition and their theft.</p>

<p>Nor did theirs appear a scheme of great danger
or of great difficulty. The testimony of a respectable
family, fixed at Alexandria in a public situation,
must intrinsically offer so much more weight than
the bare assertion of a stranger,&mdash;of a roving individual,
on whom the very mode of his appearance
cast the air of an adventurer, that, so far from the
consul having to fear any blame for not admitting
my unsupported claim, the only conduct for which
he must incur unavoidable censure would be the
weakness of giving too easy credence to my statement,
and committing to my suspicious care, upon

<!-- vol 3 page 312 -->

my bare word, the fate of a lovely unprotected
babe. Until I could back my pretensions by the
most irrefragable proofs, the consul must be justified
to every indifferent beholder in treating my
claims, my complaints, and my threats, as those
of an impostor, only come with extortionary or
vindictive views.</p>

<p>Yet how was I to obtain those proofs, the want
of which must leave me patiently resigned to my
wrongs, and quiet spectator of my Alexis remaining
the undisputed property of strangers? My right to
my own progeny had always appeared to me so
notorious and so incontestable&mdash;I so fully expected
to find its depositaries only sighing for a release
from their trust, and alarmed at my protracted
silence; I had so little idea that there existed on the
face of the globe a being disposed to rear at his
expense a child, the deserted offspring of an unknown
stranger; and I so much less conceived
the possibility of there being an individual anxious
to claim my poor foundling as his own legitimate
progeny, that not only I had never thought of
bringing the legal vouchers for my paternity to
Egypt, but had not even had its proofs duly established
in the place where it commenced. How
difficult therefore must it be, after so much time
elapsed, to obtain on that subject any sufficient or
satisfactory evidence! Euphrosyne, when she became
a mother, was a deserted female; she died a lonely
outcast; and Alexis, left from the moment he saw

<!-- vol 3 page 313 -->

the light of day in the obscurity of entire abandonment,
had passed the first period of his wretched
existence unclaimed by a father, unowned by a relation,
and in such entire concealment from all who
could feel the least interest in substantiating his
parentage, that I myself, the first time I beheld
him, had to recur to testimonials on which no one
else durst have founded a similar conviction, ere I
pressed him to my bosom as my own flesh and
blood. Even after that meeting, I had never come
forward in the world as his parent:&mdash;on the contrary;&mdash;without
on any occasion ostensibly affording
him the care becoming that sacred character, I had
only one instant&mdash;and as it were by stealth&mdash;beheld
my babe, from that moment again to leave it wholly
uninquired after, and to roam to the regions most
distant from its abode. Two individuals indeed
possessed my secret,&mdash;were apprised of my sentiments;&mdash;the
nurse, entrusted with the person of my
child, and the merchant, depositary of the poor pittance
left for its education: but the man was become
a bankrupt, the woman had betrayed her
trust. The one could nowhere be found to give
evidence in my behalf; and the other was no
doubt amply paid to back the untrue tale of my
adversaries.</p>

<p>All these circumstances, however, only rendered
my task more difficult, without in the least altering
the line of conduct I was bound to pursue. Ere
unavailing remonstrances could be safely changed

<!-- vol 3 page 314 -->

into more peremptory measures, I must try to collect
what judicial proofs&mdash;scanty though they might
be&mdash;Providence had still left within my reach.</p>

<p>In order to proceed on this arduous business
with all the advantages of local knowledge and all
the diligence of a direct interest, I first thought of
going back to Smyrna myself,&mdash;thence, if necessary,
to proceed on to Scyra, and to bribe the nurse
in the cause of truth more richly than she had been
in that of falsehood: but considerations which I
durst not disregard prevented me from pursuing
this plan. Common report represented the consul
and his family as intending early in spring to return
to Europe. In that case my child would again
be removed, and that, to realms wholly beyond my
confined sphere of action;&mdash;and, whether the journey
really was in agitation or not, to absent myself
from Alexandria, or even in that place to lose sight
a single instant of my boy, seemed to me highly
dangerous, lest, availing themselves of the opportunity,
his unjust detainers should drag him to
some spot where they might baffle all my attempts
to discover his abode, or at least deride all my
efforts to enforce my sacred right.</p>

<p>I therefore determined not to stir from the spot,
and to employ the best and most intelligent of my
remaining friends at Smyrna, to act for me in that
city and in the Archipelago. Informing the trusty
agent of all the particulars of my case, I begged he
would collect all the testimonials attainable in my

<!-- vol 3 page 315 -->

favour. The letter was sent by a messenger, who
promised to use the greatest possible speed; and,
till the answer should come, I prayed to God to
grant me patience.</p>

<p>The paltry lodging where meanwhile I fixed my
residence obliquely faced the consular mansion.
No important occurrence within its wall, productive
of external symptoms, could well escape my observation;
and, while I hired three or four lynx-eyed
emissaries to prowl about and to report on every
event at the outposts, I myself remained immoveably
stationed in my own quarters, of which the
lofty terrace commanded all the accessible parts of
the enemy's corps-de-logis. Determined not to
stir from my observatory while my Alexis remained
within side the opposite walls, I continued day
after day in the same unalterable posture, concealed
behind the lattice-work of my window, waiting an
answer to my letter, and watching the abode of my
child.</p>

<p>Sometimes indeed the tediousness of my situation
was relieved by the inexpressible pleasure of seeing
the sweet cherub himself, when taken out to enjoy
his little exercise before the door; and beyond all
conception was the rapture with which my eager
eye pursued my darling infant, in the various little
gambols and frolics, suggested by his delight at his
short and rare emancipation from an irksome confinement:
for even to him an excursion was now

<!-- vol 3 page 316 -->

become a rare occurrence. It seems that the dread
of the secret designs constantly haunted my adversaries,
and never, after my visit, as before, did they
suffer my child to be taken to any distance, or even
out of sight of the threshold, on which moreover&mdash;besides
the woman who attended him&mdash;always stood
in waiting three or four male domestics, with eyes
riveted on the boy, during the whole of the time he
remained out.</p>

<p>All this however proved how highly he was
prized, with what tenderness he was treated, and
how much his infantine happiness must be consulted
by those who detained him from his father;
and amidst all my impatience I still blessed God,
and sometimes almost my opponents themselves&mdash;miserable
as they made me&mdash;for their love of my
child.</p>

<p>For fear of unnecessarily exciting a premature
alarm, which must still increase the distrust of the
consular family, and diminish the liberty of my
boy, I took care never to show myself out of doors
in the daytime; and only at night, and when all
else in Alexandria made repose its only business,
ventured out to seek the little air and exercise
which my health indispensably required.</p>

<p>The detached cluster of habitations of which
mine was the humblest, stood nearly midway between
the busy haunts of the modern town and the
deserted site of the ancient city; and it was among

<!-- vol 3 page 317 -->

the gloomy ruins of the latter that I by preference
went at dusk to take my lonely walk. The few
straggling pillars&mdash;some nodding on their bases,
and others deprived of their capitals&mdash;which, though
dismal trunks at best, still stood erect among the
prostrate ruins around, as the lonely memorials of
countless myriads gone by, presented to my imagination
a fate so like my own, that I often thought
I read in the looks of these impassible monuments
the soothing sympathy withheld from me by man.</p>

<p>One evening, after a few hasty turns round that
wide deserted area, which once contained the finest
library, the most celebrated school, and the most
turbulent population of antiquity, I sat down to
rest myself in the dreariest part of the dreary solitude,
on the margin of a yawning catacomb, whose
sloping gallery seemed to search the inmost bowels
of the earth. Suddenly, in the midst of my melancholy
musings, sprang up from the dark recesses
of the subterraneous vault, almost underneath my
feet, a phantom of preternatural appearance, which,
after taking two or three strides, stopped to look
round; but no sooner caught the first glimpse of
my person, than it again darted forward, and disappeared
among the mounds of crumbling stone.
Except two large glaring eyes, I had been able to
distinguish no one feature, intervening between the
monstrous turban and enormous beard, which encircled

<!-- vol 3 page 318 -->

the face of this strange figure. Its height
seemed to exceed the ordinary stature of man.
Wrapped up in an ample robe which trailed on the
ground, it glided along rather than walked; and I
thought that if it belonged to the world above
ground, and not to that of the Goules from which it
came last, it could scarcely be regarded as any thing
but a lineal descendant of Pharaoh's own body
sorcerers.</p>

<p>To whatever class of beings the apparition might
belong, this seemed equally certain, that it felt little
wish to be better known:&mdash;but it was precisely that
very circumstance which made me resolve to pursue
it and find out its real nature; heedless of dangers
which caution might not be able to see, or courage
to overcome. The motion of my shadow, cast forward
by the moon, officiously announcing my intention,
caused the mysterious personage&mdash;who seemed
to have stopped behind some wall or pier to reconnoitre
his observer&mdash;again to rush forward from his
ambush, and to go on. It is true he lengthened his
steps in such a way only as to avoid the appearance
of positively running away from my pursuit: but
his knowledge of the intricacies and windings of the
place gave him nevertheless so great an advantage,
that in spite of my superior agility I hardly gained
ground upon him, except when expressly allowed to
overshoot the mark, by his sliding behind some

<!-- vol 3 page 319 -->

friendly wall or hillock, whence he no sooner saw
me on a wrong scent, than away he again dived in
an opposite direction.</p>

<p>Thus did the chase last full half an hour, when,
to my utter astonishment, I found myself again
brought back, by an immense circuit, to the mouth
of the very cave from whose dark entrails the phantom
first had darted forth, and into whose unfathomable abyss it would now again irrecoverably
have plunged, but for the very contrivance most
pointedly intended to avoid detection:&mdash;I mean that
of a garment ample beyond all reasonable dimensions.
At the very entrance of the vault it caught a
projecting stone, and, in defiance of all the pulling
and tearing of its wearer, would not be disentangled,
but brought the mysterious fugitive to a dead stop.</p>

<p>I now grasped him tight round the waist, forced
up his head which he was trying to hold down,
and by the light of the moon beheld&mdash;with wonder
beheld, spite of his enormous turban&mdash;the Italian
improvvisatore who at Smyrna, after promising me
promotion in the empire of reason, had cruelly left
me to languish in that of despotism. "Heavens,"
cried I, "Cirico, is it you?"</p>

<p>"It is," answered the detected poet, after he had
stood awhile considering whether he should say yes
or no: "and would you had been in Erebus, ere
you found me out!"</p>

<p>"And what business, may I ask, can a man,

<!-- vol 3 page 320 -->

accustomed to preach Jacobinism along the highways,
have to dress like a bearded Magus, and
take up his abode under ground in the catacombs
of Egypt?"</p>

<p>"Do you promise secrecy?" said Cirico&mdash;looking
at me earnestly.</p>

<p>"While I live," cried I;&mdash;"provided, for once,
you choose to abstain from fiction."</p>

<p>"Then, listen," replied the son of Apollo, "and
be content with plain prose;"&mdash;upon which, offering
me a seat beside him on the prostrate obelisk to
which we now had advanced, he began as follows.</p>

<p>"You remember my sudden disappearance from
Smyrna. Prompted however to my departure,
rather by an abstract wish to leave that city than
by a distinct preference for any other particular
place, I had myself rowed to the first vessel in the
harbour ready to set sail, and, when under weigh,
asked whither I was going? To Alexandria was
the answer,&mdash;and it pleased me. I remembered
hearing a certain ambassador at Constantinople describe
his consul in Egypt as a man entirely absorbed,
not in trade or politics, but in magnetism;
and it was on the never-sufficiently-to-be-eulogised
virtues of that admirable fluid that I built my little
scheme. The chain of evidence as to my identity,
between the sea-ports of the Levant more to the
westward, and Alexandria, was easily broken by
my landing at Damiat, assuming the garb of the

<!-- vol 3 page 321 -->

country, and only appearing at Alexandria some
months after my departure from Smyrna, so completely
smoke-dried, and with such a beard, and
such a benish, that, but for pulling off my turban
as you did, you yourself would never have found
me out. I therefore burst upon this new world like
one of those torrents which, from an unknown source
in the snowy Alps, rush all at once into the vale
below. It must however be confessed, that, when first
introduced to my intended patient in the character
of an Italian nobleman on his way to the Pyramids,
the colossal figure of the uncouth Scythian, his
shaksheer hanging about his heels, his turban awry
on his head, and still more than all that, his face
resembling that of an old leopard, with a pair
of whiskers diverging from under his broad flat
nose like the bristles of a clothes-brush, so disconcerted
me, as at first to put my whole story completely
out of my head: nor was the little tale I had
prepared of much use when recalled to my remembrance;
for I soon found by the consul's account
that he himself was filled with so vast a supply of the
magnetic virtue, as only to want a person equally
void of intellect and full of faith, for the purpose
of being made the passive recipient of his all-penetrating
influence. Nothing therefore was required
of me in this affair, but to seem a chef-d'&oelig;uvre of
natural dulness,&mdash;a vacuum that should contain no
single thought of its own, to clash with the brilliant

<!-- vol 3 page 322 -->

coruscations of which I was to become the unconscious
vehicle."</p>

<p>"And could an improvvisatore of the first water,"
cried I&mdash;interrupting Cirico&mdash;"submit thus to conceal
his talents; to hide his light under a bushel; to
stem the tide of his poetic <i>estro</i>, by which I have
been more than once nearly overwhelmed?"</p>

<p>"Friend!" resumed Cirico, "no difficulties could
for an instant arrest a genius like mine. A plan
immediately presented itself to my mind, which
might combine in any given proportion the imbecility
required by drowsy magnetism, and the unremitting
worship vowed by me to the Muses.&mdash;The consul's
offers were accepted; I left the pyramids to their
fate, and stayed to be magnetised.</p>

<p>"But!&mdash;when thrown into the customary coma;
in what shape do you think that the emanations
of the consul's intellect, with which his dumpy
claws had been cramming me until the perspiration
had drenched his grisly whiskers, flowed from my
poetic lips? Can a bell&mdash;whatever substance may
strike it&mdash;emit any sound but that of metal? Can
a harp&mdash;touched by whom it may&mdash;be mistaken
for a drum? Then let who might magnetise Giacinto
Cirico, I still could only spout Italian operas.
Availing myself of the leisure which my apparent
idiocy gave me, to spend the whole day in perfecting
compositions intended some time or other to eclipse
those of Metastasio himself, I recited these high-wrought

<!-- vol 3 page 323 -->

productions of my own Muse, on the magnetic
evenings, as the spontaneous explosions of the
consul's prompting genius: and, though this gentleman
felt a little startled at first at the strange form
his emanations assumed, and wondered he should
have inspired me&mdash;of all things under heaven&mdash;with
the <i>scenas</i> of a pastoral; he soon discovered in my
recitativos and arias a mystic sense; while I soon
derived from them a solid support:&mdash;for I affected
to feel much exhausted by the operation, and took
special care that the sittings should not be gratuitous.</p>

<p>"Even this, however, could hardly make me
amends for the mortification which I constantly
experienced, since the consul felt so fearful lest the
world might not give his magnetic virtue the credit
of my effusions, that to my own face he used to
expatiate with every new comer on my intellectual
nothingness, until, to avoid this daily disgust, as
well as the danger of being detected while at my
work, I took the habit of retiring during the greater
part of the day to these ruins, where I write undisturbed,
and whence I only issue forth in the cool
of the evening, at the magnetic hour. I was just
going to my task, when, by squatting yourself down
over the mouth of my cavern, you kept me entrapped,
till, fearing to be late, I made a bold push, which
ended in my discovery. But you are too honourable

<!-- vol 3 page 324 -->

to betray one who reposes in you such unbounded
confidence."</p>

<p>The poet here stopped, and left me to ruminate.
After a few moments of equal silence on both sides,
"Cirico," said I, "tell me one thing. I have a <i>pet</i>
consul as well as yourself. I know the two sages
frequently visit. Is signor R&mdash;&mdash; likewise bitten?"</p>

<p>"He is;" replied the improvvisatore.</p>

<p>"Then Heaven relents!" cried I,&mdash;and once
more felt hope revive; told Cirico my story, and,
having concluded it,&mdash;"now," added I, "you must
do me a favour. In your comas you must impress
my consul&mdash;whether in song or in recitativo, no
matter!&mdash;with the heinousness of keeping other
people's children, and the inconvenience which may
arise from such proceedings; and if by so doing
you get mine restored to his rightful owner, depend
upon my eternal gratitude and services." Cirico
promised to compose an interlude on purpose; and
departed to join his expectant circle:&mdash;so did I to
return to my lonely lodging.</p>

<p>And more lonely, more sad still was it fated to
become: for presently even the transient gleams
of happiness reflected upon its walls from the opposite
mansion&mdash;the occasional glimpses I had of my
child&mdash;were destined to cease; and this through
my own fault too!</p>

<p>It happened the day after the interview with the

<!-- vol 3 page 325 -->

poet. As usual my eyes were riveted upon the door
of the consular mansion: as usual it began at a certain
hour to vibrate, described with provoking slowness
a small segment of a circle, and, thus cautiously
half opened, at last let out as if by stealth my Alexis
and his nurse, to take a little air within its immediate
reach: but while the woman settles her new tucker,
the little angel&mdash;moved by a sudden impulse&mdash;slily
slips through her negligent fingers, and, feeling
himself at liberty, darts forward like an arrow, and
in play runs and hides behind my projecting wall.
From my own window my eye, plunging right
upon him, beheld his sweet face peeping out to
enjoy his nurse's search; and down I rushed to embrace
my heart's darling:&mdash;but already it was too
late! Already had the cherub, unwilling to distress
his favourite, run back to her arms; and when I
came out, he seemed, by the warmth of his caresses,
to be craving her pardon.</p>

<p>Could a father witness such endearments, and
abstain from claiming his share! Great as was the
imprudence of the act, I ran after my child, and
in its nurse's own resisting arms imprinted on its
lovely face a thousand hurried kisses.</p>

<p>From the moment my person had appeared in
sight, the woman had set up such a yell of frantic
imprecations as soon brought out into the road all
the other too remiss attendants. Immediately they
strove to tear the child away from me,&mdash;and, fearful

<!-- vol 3 page 326 -->

lest the tender babe should suffer in the struggle, I
relinquished my hold; but, going home, I pressed,
as I went along, my lips on each print of its dear
little feet.</p>

<p>From that hour the sight of my darling boy was
vouchsafed me no longer. One, two, three whole
subsequent days&mdash;spent in the most anxious expectation
and watching&mdash;were slowly brought to their
conclusion, without my being able to perceive the
least glimpse even of the most inferior of the guardians
to whose care my child seemed especially committed:
and while in the daytime I was thus disappointed of
my former solace, I could as little at night obtain
sight of Cirico. As if actuated by some new impulse,
he had ceased frequenting his former haunts;
he answered not even my unceasing notes of inquiry;
and at last it struck me that the traitor, aware how
much I had to say to his disadvantage, so far from
labouring in my cause, might rather be trying to
render it desperate, and to secure to himself a fresh
support in other quarters, by contributing to my
ruin. From his unaccountable silence as well as
disappearance, I concluded that not only he had imparted
to my adversaries all my designs, but had
assisted them in eluding my vigilance, and conveying
my Alexis away. At this idea, which every thing
that met my observation only tended to confirm, I
no longer felt able to set bounds to my paternal anguish;
ran out on the road, into the street, and on

<!-- vol 3 page 327 -->

the quay; and wherever I went, denounced the detainers
of my child, loaded them with imprecations,
and urged the populace to pull down their nefarious
abode. Of this sally too I had to pay the penalty.</p>

<p>Mourad, whom my very first feats in Egypt had
been secretly hostile to,&mdash;Mourad, whom I had
since fought openly under Hassan's banners,&mdash;
Mourad, whose blood my hand had drawn and
whose face it had disfigured, now ruled the Bahair&eacute;,
and consequently was master at Alexandria.
How ill I must stand in the favour of this implacable
Bey could not fail to be found out to my detriment,
by those interested in baffling my exertions and
marring my project. They represented me as a
spy of the Porte upon the rulers of Egypt, and
gave to the real object of my journey the colour of
a mere pretence. Accordingly, a few days only
after I had seen my Alexis for the last time, I received
a formal injunction from the governor of the
place, in the name of the authorities of Cairo, to
quit the land of the mamlukes within twenty-four
hours, under pain of certain forfeiture of life.</p>

<p>At this blow I almost lost my senses. "They
triumph then," I cried, "my inhuman oppressors!
They part me for ever from the only object capable
of throwing a charm over my remaining days! Then
why seek to preserve an odious existence: why not
take away my child by force, or perish in the attempt!
And hereupon I determined, unless my Alexis was

<!-- vol 3 page 328 -->

restored to me immediately, to deal death around,
and to end with myself,&mdash;and, drawing my handjar,
sallied forth into the street to execute my purpose.</p>

<p>At the very first turn I met a messenger, sent
by Cirico, in search of my lodging. He slipped
into my hands a pencil note, only containing these
short words, "To the catacombs without delay!"</p>

<p>Without delay I went. I had always, it is true,
believed Cirico to be a rogue; but not an ill natured
rogue. Though he would most gladly have
seen all the crowned heads of Europe ranged like
ripe pumpkins in a fruit-stall, I was convinced that he
would rather of the two help to keep that of a private
friend upon its own shoulders. Already had he
been waiting some time, when I reached the place
appointed.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried he in a solemn tone, seeing me
move my lips to speak, "waste not uselessly your
breath: it may be wanted hereafter. Magnetism,&mdash;that
mystery which reveals all other mysteries&mdash;has
informed me of all that you are panting to relate.
I might have predicted it; but why announce
evils which we cannot prevent!"</p>

<p>"Is this all you have to say?" I exclaimed, disappointed.</p>

<p>"Not all;" answered Cirico. "Your consul has
by my magnetic speeches been made to feel compunction
for his unjust proceedings: he is certain
now your brat will bring him ill luck."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 329 -->

<p>"Then why does he not restore the angel to its
parent?"</p>

<p>"Because he is prevented by superior fears."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of the thing to him most awful,&mdash;of his termagant
wife; whose attraction I always found to be
of the negative sort. After my magnetic sleep I
took R&mdash;&mdash; into a corner, and spoke to him broad
awake. He then ventured to acknowledge his
dread of his rib; and owned he would give the world
to see justice done you, provided he had no hand in
the doing. In short, you have his leave to recover
your child in whatever way you please,&mdash;by stratagem
or by force."</p>

<p>"Little thanks to any man for that privilege!"
cried I;&mdash;"such a sort of leave I might have taken
without asking it."</p>

<p>"R&mdash;&mdash; means," rejoined the poet, "that if you
should devise a clever method of smuggling the
urchin out of his mansion, or even of entering it by
storm;&mdash;if no measure less daring will do,&mdash;he
will not stand in the breach to repel you, nor yet
struggle very hard to wrest the prize out of your
hands."</p>

<p>"But if I fail, I must take all the consequences."</p>

<p>"Just so. He will then enforce in its utmost
rigour the decree of the Beys, in order to clear himself
to his loving wife from all suspicion of a return
to honesty."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 330 -->

<p>I paused a while.&mdash;At last,&mdash;looking significantly&mdash;"Cirico,"
I cried, "fires are frequent evils in
these realms. Tell the consul&mdash;the instant he
smells the least smoke&mdash;to turn without fail his
whole gynec&aelig;um into the street." And thus having
given a hint of my scheme, we discussed the best
mode of execution; which being settled,&mdash;not without
a good deal of argumentation,&mdash;we parted for
the present: but soon to meet again in a different

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beginning</span> with the purpose in which my plan
was to end, I first went to the harbour, to see what
vessels were ready for sailing. Besides a felucca,
brimful of fresh-made hadjees, going to be dropped
at the different Barbary ports, I only found a small
polacre laden with grain for Ancona, already in the
roads, and only waiting the evening land-breeze to
set sail. In consideration of the liberal price to be
paid for the passage, the captain agreed to weigh
anchor the instant I should come on board.</p>

<p>Thus provided on one element, I began to
consider how to manage the opposite element on
which my scheme depended: but I own I saw much
greater difficulty in making an useful ally of fire
than of water; and it puzzled me not a little how
to raise a flame round the consular mansion, and
yet, not to pass for an incendiary. The gynec&aelig;um,
besides, which I was most anxious to smoke, lay at
the back of the house, and stood protected from
external approach by a formidable blank wall. To
kindle combustibles under its well screened windows,
in such a way as to occasion a great fright
with little real mischief, might have baffled the skill
of an abler engineer. My expedient was to tack

<!-- vol 3 page 332 -->

bundles of wool, straw, and other inflammable stuff,
by means of wires, to long slender poles.</p>

<p>The hour being arrived which was wont to witness
the first concord of consular slumbers, our
hostile operations commenced. Part of my myrmidons
hid their apparatus and persons near the
quarter which I meant to alarm, and there waited
my signal, while the remainder, with myself, lay
perdu behind a low shed facing the entrance door.
The shrill whistle which was to set in motion my
machinery was soon sounded, and presently we saw
rising in slow majesty, from behind the battlements
of the beleaguered building, a thick column of
smoke, which not only over-canopied the spreading
roof, but circulated in a wavy stream round the various
apartments. Loud cries of "fire" hailed
its appearance from without: the alarm was given
to those within by knocking at all the apertures;
and, in a few minutes, it was evident that every
soul in the mansion was on foot.</p>

<p>Yet did not a creature venture out. The door
on which my eyes were riveted remained as immoveably
fast as before, and, while the neighbours
began to flock from all quarters to the spot, the
inert inmates of the house seemed to make no
attempt to escape.</p>

<p>My mind now again misgave me, and suspicions
of every sort rushed into my imagination. Perhaps
after all Cirico had played me false: perhaps the

<!-- vol 3 page 333 -->

consul had found his courage or his cowardice fail
him: perhaps my enemies were actually watching
to surprise me in the commission of a seemingly
heinous crime. Meanwhile minute after minute
was elapsing; the night watch of the Franks would
soon go its rounds; nay my combustibles, almost
burnt out, threatened to put a speedy end to the
siege, even independent of a sally or a rescue,&mdash;when
no other fate could befall Alexis' miserable
father but being driven out of baneful Egypt, and
breed to bid his child&mdash;his darling child&mdash;an everlasting
farewell.</p>

<p>In this situation I had already begun to consider
whether it might not be better to take myself off
at once, than to await the issue of my desperate
scheme; when at last the house door&mdash;suddenly
bursting open with a tremendous crash&mdash;poured
forth into the street, in one single rapid stream, a
far longer string of females than I had fancied the
whole mansion could contain.</p>

<p>The consuless herself led the van, enveloped in
a loose wrapper. Immediately after came my
Alexis, still flushed with rosy sleep and in the arms
of his nurse. A set of pale and ghastly attendants,
screaming to excite interest, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost:&mdash;while my trusty attendants
darted across the way, to break the line of
the procession and to insulate the nurse, I sprung
forward to snatch away the child;&mdash;but already had

<!-- vol 3 page 334 -->

my figure caught the eye of his ever watchful
guardian. She gave her usual warning whoop,
and instinctively all the other women echoed the
yell. The concert brought around us all the bystanders
who had gradually collected, and who,
seeing a tall fellow lay hold of an infant and carry
it off, stopped not to inquire his right, but immediately
set up after me a loud cry and a general pursuit.</p>

<p>For rendering it ineffectual I relied on my agility,
assisted by the deep shadows of the night: but the
pursuing troop was too near, and at every step I
advanced, its numbers were increased by all those
who, running to the fire, met us on the way, and
turned back to join the chase. The only thing
I could do was to draw my yatagan, and, while
with one arm I shielded my babe from the incessant
shower of stones, with the other to brandish
my weapon, and to beat off the pelting mob.
Sometimes, in order to prevent being closed in
upon, I was obliged to face about and to make a
few passes, calculated to teach those who came too
near their proper distance: but in so doing a sharp
pebble hit my lovely infant's face, and made the
blood gush in streams from his cheek. At this
sight I grew desperate; my strength seemed to
increase tenfold; and at every stroke of my sabre
some miscreant was maimed, or bit the dust.</p>

<p>What power could resist a father fighting for
his child! Terror gradually seized all the nearest

<!-- vol 3 page 335 -->

rabble: the rest slackened their pace; and a certain
space intervened between the pursuers and their
intended prey. I was about a dozen yards ahead
of the foremost, when the lantern, agreed upon
as the signal of the boat, began to glimmer on the
shore. I now mustered all my remaining strength,
and, with only such few windings as were necessary
to throw the blood-hounds off the scent, made for
the beacon. Many, tired of the chase, had already
given in; and a small portion only of the pack still
kept yelping at a distance.</p>

<p>I therefore thought myself safe;&mdash;when all at
once between me and the goal flashed, like forked
lightning, two uplifted sabres, whose wearers had
in my windings got before me, and were now waiting
to cut off my retreat.</p>

<p>What was to be done?&mdash;An instant I stopped
and hesitated: but, with a dozen rascals at my
heels, and only two in front, I had no choice, and
rushed forward. At the critical moment I suddenly
waved my hand, and, as if addressing some friends
stationed near, cried out "to fire." The expectant
pair on this started back, and looked round, while
I, seizing my opportunity, darted by them like a
thunderbolt. They soon however rallied again, and
one actually had his hand on my shoulder, and
was at last going to stop my career, when, wheeling
half round, I released my person at the expense of
his fingers. The low reef now lay before me, under

<!-- vol 3 page 336 -->

which was moored the boat, and, having scrambled
on the platform, I was going to leap in, when, just
at the moment of taking my spring, a loose stone
made me slip, and I plunged into the waves between
the rock and the barge. My child escaped all injury.
Caught by Cirico, who stood on the projecting
ledge waiting my arrival, he was handed safe
to the sailors; but his father had less luck. The
zeal of the boatmen to disentangle me, causing them
all to press upon the side of the boat under which
I lay wedged, made their collective weight almost
crush me to death, and I was only extricated with
a couple of ribs broken, my chest miserably bruised,
and my loins pierced through by the sharpness of
the rocks.</p>

<p>Having fainted the instant I was dragged into
the boat, I continued in that state until conveyed
on board the ship. There, various applications
at last brought me to life again, when I found
that we were under weigh, and already far out at
sea. Still could my first sensations scarcely be
called very pleasant. With consciousness had come
pain: my inward bruises now tortured me, and occasioned
copious expectorations of blood. As soon,
however, as I recovered my speech, I inquired after
my child, and he was pointed out to me lying in
a little crib, and just lapsed&mdash;after a world of woe&mdash;into
a profound and tranquil sleep. When first
put on board, the blood mixed with dust which entirely

<!-- vol 3 page 337 -->

covered his face, had rendered him a frightful
spectacle: but on the unsightly crust being washed
off, there only remained a small bruise under his
eye of little importance. His chief distresses had
been those of his susceptible mind. Torn in the
middle of the night from an elegant mansion, a retinue
of tender females, and an affectionate nurse,
and that, to be the object of a sanguinary contest,
to receive a smarting wound, and to be carried on
board a miserable vessel, where nothing met his eye
but strange and hard-featured sailors, whose very
offices of kindness looked more like acts of violence,
no wonder that the sensitive child should at first
have shrunk with terror from the novel and appalling
scene;&mdash;and it was only when exhausted with
fruitless entreaties and crying, that he fell into the
quiet slumber in which, on recovering my senses, I
found his mind and body deeply sunk.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my sufferings and my weakness,
when, after so many difficulties and dangers, I
thus saw the object of all my hopes and fears at last
safe in my possession, I could not be restrained from
giving full scope to my raptures, crawled to the
crib entrusted with my treasure, and there&mdash;afraid
to disturb its soft slumbers&mdash;knelt and gazed upon
it in an ecstacy of joy. Scarcely could I believe so
much loveliness to be my own possession, and in
my transport&mdash;as I was afterwards told&mdash;I laughed

<!-- vol 3 page 338 -->

and cried in turns, until the whole crew thought me
positively crazed. By degrees however I became
somewhat more composed; but, as the ferment of
my joy abated, my pains put in their claims afresh,
till at last&mdash;unable any longer to bear an upright
posture&mdash;I lay down by my babe, awaiting the moment
when breaking from his sleep, he should leave
me at liberty to press him to my bosom.</p>

<p>Far different from mine, however, were on first
awaking my boy's own emotions. The moment he
unclosed his eyes, a look of terror overcast his sweet
countenance. He stared fearfully around, seemed
awhile wholly lost in amazement at things so new
and strange, and then, recollecting the change he
had experienced, burst into a flood of tears, and
loudly called his paramana. In vain I addressed
him in the most soothing language,&mdash;saying I was
his father, and my care for my child should exceed
all other care. His only answer was to intreat I
would restore him to the friends from whom I had
stolen him; and on my stating the impossibility of
granting his petition, he loaded me with all the
innocent invectives which his gentle heart could
suggest. No peace offering of which I could think
was accepted, whether addressed to the eye or the
palate: all my gifts were spurned,&mdash;and only a fast,
protracted long beyond the usual period, could for
an instant make hunger impose silence on grief.

<!-- vol 3 page 339 -->

Reluctantly my Alexis then consented to take some
food at my hands;&mdash;and this was the first paternal
office I ministered to my child.</p>

<p>For several days I myself continued to want the
nursing I bestowed. Only while I lay motionless on
my back did the pain in my loins become bearable.
The smallest exertion renewed all my agonies, and
called forth fresh streams of blood from my chest.
Insensibly, however, the symptoms of an internal injury
became less alarming; the broken ribs seemed
to knit again, and the external bruises healed apace:
but I remained languid, incapable of enduring the
least fatigue, totally bereft of appetite, and seldom
visited by refreshing slumbers.</p>

<p>Those of my child were my only cordial. Determined
not to be disheartened by his first repulses,
which only showed the steadiness of his infant mind,
I continued my endearments with unwearied perseverance,
until at last I gained his good-will and
his confidence. Many, it is true, were the days ere
my unceasing solicitude could drive from his memory
the constant thoughts of his regretted home;
and even after he seemed in general reconciled to
the change, he would still at particular hours, and
sometimes in the very midst of his mirth and
laughter, display a sudden revulsion of features,
and break into fresh and poignant paroxysms of
grief; but in the yet soft and pliant organs of his
infant brain, the impression of things and persons

<!-- vol 3 page 340 -->

wholly gone by was gradually effaced, and the later
objects which replaced these, stamped on his yet
tender sensory their fresher and more recent forms
with at least equal force: he accustomed himself
to his situation, and recovered his serenity. His
anxious mind became susceptible of a new species
of uneasiness,&mdash;that of losing sight of me; and at
last, won over entirely by my love, he transferred to
his father all the warm affections of his susceptible
heart.</p>

<p>He even gave me more than he had given yet:
for to the singularly early development of his reason
and moral feeling his former guardians had not yet
begun their appeal, and, by addressing the first
these new expanding faculties, I obtained over him
a stronger hold, while I paid him a more flattering
homage, than he had yet experienced. Mine had
been the first consolatory speeches:&mdash;it was he now
who studied to soothe my sufferings by his care;
who unceasingly watched my countenance; amused
me with his prattle when I felt in spirits, and lay
down in silence by my side, when I looked dejected
and sorrowful. How therefore&mdash;in the absence of
all other feelings, and on the cessation of every
other tie&mdash;I began to dote on this sole new object
of all my thoughts and projects, no words can express.
Hour after hour I hung over his cherub
face, contemplating as in a mirror that of his lovely
and unhappy mother: and many a time, when his

<!-- vol 3 page 341 -->

heavenly smile beamed upon me, when his little
arms hung round my neck, and when his lips imprinted
soft kisses on my cheek, I thought&mdash;"Anastasius,
Anastasius, what hast thou done to deserve
such a blessing? Tremble lest it should prove an
honied cup, offered to thy lips by an avenging Providence,
only for an instant to be tasted,&mdash;then
dashed to the ground!"</p>

<p>Our voyage was prosperous enough, until we got
into the latitude of Cerigo. There a perverse tramontana
seemed to lie in wait with no other object
than to shut against us the narrow entrance of the
Adriatic. If now and then the wind did come
about for a moment, we no sooner began to make
a little way than, as if on purpose to mock us, it
immediately again shifted back to its old quarter.
It afforded a Malthese privateer every convenience
for making us bring to; and the ship's papers
being deemed somewhat suspicious, and the cargo
Turkish property outright, the vessel was compelled
to change its course to Maltha, there to undergo
legal investigation. That island wanted corn, and
the captain himself seemed to have no objection to
a shorter voyage and a better market. Useless,
under such circumstances, would have been the
opposition of a passenger. What is he by the side
of the cargo&mdash;by that of a single bale of goods?
and I comforted myself with the thought that I
should sooner be on land, and more speedily obtain
medical advice.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 342 -->

<p>A lazaretto is a sort of purgatory, intervening
between the regions of infidelity and the realms of
true belief; and quarantine may be termed an
ordeal through which all must pass, who, coming
from the one, seek admittance into the other. Arrived
in my place of temporary confinement at
Maltha, I employed the period required to prove
my freedom from one species of disease, in taking
remedies for another, less violent&mdash;but, alas! more
tenacious. The inward soreness continued unabated,
spite of all the emollients and drugs, liberally
supplied from the medicine chest of a traveller
who had been penned up, on his return from a
voyage to the Levant, about the same time with
myself.</p>

<p>Designing, I suppose, to write a book, signor
Lauri (that was the gentleman's name) seemed as
anxious to settle his estimate of the nations which
he had just quitted, as I felt desirous of forming
an opinion of those whose precincts I was on the
point of entering:&mdash;whence our conversation turned
chiefly upon the difference between the natives of
the East and those of the West. The predestinarian
principles of the former found in my friend a
doughty opponent: "What"&mdash;used he to exclaim,
sagaciously knitting his brow&mdash;"can be at once
more absurd in theory, and more prejudicial in
practice&mdash;more destructive of all prudence, and
more inimical to all exertion&mdash;than to maintain that
whatever be the nature of intervening occurrences,

<!-- vol 3 page 343 -->

certain peculiar leading events widely distant from
each other&mdash;such as the choice of a wife, the birth
of a child, the accession to an estate, the hour of
death, and our state in the life hereafter&mdash;must still
take the same course? It is totally denying all
connexion between cause and effect."</p>

<p>"You are right," I answered.&mdash;"That connexion
appears to preserve, from the very first
origin of things unto their last perceptible developement,
a continuity so entire, so unbroken,
that, instead of this partial, disjointed, incomplete
predestination, only existing by halves, only ruling
a few detached incidents of our lives, only presenting
insulated phenomena, arising from no previous
cause and producing no subsequent effects, we can
admit nothing short of an universal preordination,
embracing alike every minutest occurrence and
every most important event of our existence."</p>

<p>Here my friend's disturbance increased: he asked
me what was to become, with such an universal preordination,
of our free-agency, our free-will?</p>

<p>"Whatever can or may;" was my answer.
"Even he who should think himself possessed of
free-agency in its utmost fulness, from his hand
being ever left to execute uncontrolled every wildest
wish of his mind, (and how few there are that
labour under so dire a misfortune!) is still not a
free-agent in the smallest degree, since the will
from which his actions proceed is not free."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 344 -->

<p>"The will itself not free!"&mdash;cried Lauri, quite
aghast;&mdash;"and that, even where, instead of being
the immediate result of some headlong over-ruling
passion, it should be the slow and deliberate offspring
of the longest suspense, and the most mature
consideration?"</p>

<p>"Not even then," I resumed. "The first desire
of modifying the will according to such mature
consideration, of submitting it to such protracted
suspense, (conditions witnessed but seldom!) can
only have arisen from such a mass of knowledge unintentionally
acquired, and such a concurrence of
impressions unintentionally experienced, as must
render the later results more obviously than ever
the effect only of circumstances wholly incompatible
with the inherent freedom of that will."</p>

<p>"Then let us at least," cried Lauri in complete
despair, "&mdash;thus tied hands and feet&mdash;derive from
our indestructible fetters another species of comfort:
let us no longer struggle to obtain what we may
wish for; but lie still, and suffer ourselves to be
quietly swept down the stream of our uncontrollable
destiny. Our efforts to mend it must be all in vain."</p>

<p>"And are you then so blind," replied I rather
bluntly, "as not to perceive that whatever faculty
of commanding future events we lose by a partial
and disjointed predestination&mdash;according to which, as
certain occurrences happen without previous regular
causes, others must remain unproductive of regular

<!-- vol 3 page 345 -->

consequences&mdash;is more than restored to us by a
preordination so universal, that nothing can arise
except from an uninterrupted series of prior modifications;
that, consequently, when we employ the
means uniformly appropriated by Providence to
peculiar ends, we have no failure to fear except
from the opposition of other modifications, as yet
unknown perhaps, but equally subjected by that
Providence to definite rules; and finally, that,
though our will and our knowledge must ever
proceed from some of the prior phenomena of that
preordination, that very knowledge and will may
themselves in their turn produce some of its later
yet undeveloped ramifications? Name a single instance
of the power in man to command, to calculate,
to foresee future events, founded on his experience
of past occurrences, which can originate in
any thing but the necessary preordained connexion
between them."</p>

<p>"Still,"&mdash;muttered Lauri,&mdash;"whatever left our
will invariably depending on our knowledge, and
our knowledge on extraneous circumstances, must
annihilate our claim to eternal rewards, and our
liability to everlasting punishments."</p>

<p>"Why then," was my reply, "let us give up
altogether those sufferings without end, which, of
use neither to deter nor to correct, seem after all
little reconcileable with the justice or the goodness
of a Creator, who, having made his creatures

<!-- vol 3 page 346 -->

fallible, would hardly, at any period of time, shut
the gates of mercy for ever against the repentant
sinner. Indeed, it may be questioned, in my
opinion, whether even a penal retribution limited
in its duration is&mdash;logically speaking&mdash;consistent
with the relation between a creature in a retrospective
view entirely passive, and his omnipotent
Creator; or admissible otherwise than between man
and man."</p>

<p>"Take away the legality of punishments,"&mdash;cried
Lauri with a victorious smile,&mdash;"and you
take away the existence of deserts!"</p>

<p>"To insist on the smallest deserts with respect to
his Maker," I answered, "seems to me in man the
height of presumption. Man had no right to be born:
he owes his existence, his very virtues to the bounty
of his Creator, and to that bounty I am content to
owe all my happiness, here and hereafter, even if
I were to be raised to the perfections of an angel:&mdash;and
as to punishments, or, in other words, sufferings
not arising immediately from the nature of
the deeds, or from the desire of producing amendment
in the author&mdash;I myself, wretched creature,
prone to passion, and often inflamed by an irresistible
thirst for vengeance as I am, could I inflict
chastisement on my own sweet babe, and for
faults for which I scarce can blame him, otherwise
than in order to render him ultimately both better
and happier!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 347 -->

<p>"Adieu, then," resumed Lauri piteously, "if
not to all motives for exertion, at least to all exertions
in the cause of virtue! Your preordination,
and the utter absence of accountability it implies,
cannot fail to afford to those that desire it a free
licence for every vice!"</p>

<p>"A licence so injurious, so deprecable," I observed,
"could only derive from a doctrine&mdash;if
such there be&mdash;which should destroy the natural,
the inherent, the eternal connexion between good
deeds and happiness; and should admit a chance
of obtaining bliss eternal, without renouncing evil.</p>

<p>"But mine,"&mdash;added I,&mdash;"is not such a doctrine.
However much preordination may seem to
cancel man's accountability, and to take from his
sufferings the character of direct punishment, it is
not the less true (and too well I feel it!) that,
according to that very preordination, misery is on
this side of the grave or on the other the unavoidable
consequence of evil, and real permanent
happiness only attainable through corresponding
goodness;&mdash;and is so the more, from the very
strictness of that preordination."</p>

<p>"But what boots," Lauri asked, "even a preordination
thus directed, without that free-agency,
that free-will, which alone can enable us to turn
its laws to our advantage?"</p>

<p>"As soon," was my answer, "as the knowledge
of an indispensable connexion between virtue and

<!-- vol 3 page 348 -->

happiness reaches our hearts, our will must, from
its very want of freedom, its very subservience to
our knowledge, become unavoidably abhorrent from
evil; and until a knowledge of such a connexion is
attained, the utmost freedom of will could still not
induce a preference for good. Whoever therefore has&mdash;no
matter how&mdash;himself attained that knowledge,
will rather endeavour to lead others, through its
diffusion and empire over their will, irresistibly to
good, than risk tempting them, by insisting on the
freedom of their volition, to try its independence in
resisting virtue's voice;&mdash;and since I have (not
without paying dearly for it) at last obtained a
glimpse of this valuable knowledge, with you, my
Alexis!" added I, embracing my child, "let me
begin the pleasing task of rendering it fruitful!"</p>

<p>For the sake of this darling child, I gave up a
project, to the performance of which I had long pertinaciously
clung:&mdash;it was that of making a solemn
and public abjuration of Islamism. This scheme,
it is true, had already been forcibly combated by
Caridi, the chief promoter of my voyage to Trieste.
"Why," used he to say, "make your return to the
faith of your fathers, which in reality can only be
an act of the mind, a spectacle for the multitude?
It is a thing more likely to scandalise than to edify;
to remind people that the church suffered an infidelity,
than that it has recovered a stray sheep:"&mdash;but,
though my reason gave assent to the remark,

<!-- vol 3 page 349 -->

my heart still recoiled from the counsel. I always
seemed to be composed of two wholly distinct persons:
the one argumentative, sophistical; the other
entirely under the influence of my imagination:
and these different beings never became sufficiently
amalgamated into one single uninterrupted identity.
Now, of these two persons the latter was the one which
exerted most sway on this occasion. I felt as if
wanting all the outward show of penitence, all the
external demonstration of sorrow, effectually to atone
for my errors and to hush my remorse. To lie in
the dead of the night, on the cold pavement of the
church, before the cross of our Saviour or the shrine
of my patron saint; to wash the steps of the sanctuary
with my tears, or to make its walls re-echo with my
moanings, seemed to be that which could alone restore
to my mind its composure, and to my heart its
tranquillity:&mdash;but my Alexis had attained that age
at which the spectacle of my penance must convey
to him the suspicion of my shame&mdash;the knowledge
of my guilt;&mdash;and what tender parent can give up
the esteem of his child! Nay, even if the acknowledgments
of my transgressions were not to lower me in
his estimation, the memory of my debasement might
lower his own value in the eyes of the world.
Whatever conditions, therefore, my more scrupulous
cousin might exact from me at a later period, on
my arrival at Trieste, I determined for the present
only to slide back into the bosom of the church

<!-- vol 3 page 350 -->

unperceived, and to avail myself of the high walls
and deep solitude of my prison, to resume in silence
the solemn rites of my ancestors, and the old, often
regretted, and truly Christian name of Anastasius,
given me by my parents.</p>

<p>Determined to shake off as much as possible all
that marked the native of the East, and to adopt all
that might assist me to assimilate with the children
of the West, I proceeded from the inward to the
outward man; but, though my person was no longer,
as erst, the sole idol of my heart, I yet continued
sufficiently impressed with the advantage of good
looks, to feel a very different sensation on quitting
the Osmanlee attire from that which I had experienced
on doffing the santon's rags. It seemed to
me a sort of degradation to exchange the rich and
graceful garb of the East, which either shows the
limbs as nature moulded them, or makes amends
for their concealment by ample and majestic drapery,
for a dress which confines without covering,
disfigures without protecting, gives the gravest man
the air of a mountebank, and, from the uncouth
shape of the shreds sowed together to compose it,
only looks like the invention of penury for the use
of beggars;&mdash;and when I came to mutilating my
very person, to cutting into the quick of my growth;&mdash;when,
without being able to give my face a
feminine softness, I was only going to deprive it of
the signs of manhood; to sever from my lips my

<!-- vol 3 page 351 -->

long cherished mustachios, I own it required all the
philosophical reflections which I could muster up
on the nothingness of a few hairs, to persuade me
to lay the fearful steel to their roots.</p>

<p>But what was the difficulty of changing the outward
trappings of the body, to that of dismissing
the habits rooted in the inmost recesses of the mind?
what was that of adopting the dress which the tailor
could model, to that of assuming manners which
must be the result of the nicest observation, and the
longest practice? In the East each different age,
and nation, and rank, and profession, however
closely intermixed with the others, still retains its
peculiar garb and formulas, its stated place and
boundaries, as distinctly marked as they are immutably
fixed. In the East centuries succeed centuries,
new generations tread on the remains of generations
gone before them, and empires themselves are
founded and are destroyed, without the limits that
circumscribe the different races of men and orders
of society being confounded or transgressed. In the
East nothing in point of forms, of address, and of
manners is indefinite, or arbitrary, or mutable, or
left to the impulse of the moment or the taste of the
individual. In the East, therefore, it is easy to learn
by rote the unchangeable exigencies of society; and
every individual, whatever situation he may obtain&mdash;whether
from a slave he become a master, from
a civilian a soldier, or from a subject a sovereign&mdash;immediately

<!-- vol 3 page 352 -->

knows how to fit himself to his new
place, and how to act his new part, void of embarrassment,
or awkwardness, or even vulgarity.</p>

<p>Far different appeared the system of the West!
There, on the contrary, whatever the eye could
view or the mind comprehend&mdash;from the most fundamental
organization of states to the most superficial
gloss of social intercourse&mdash;seemed unfixed,
discretional, subject to constant revolution, and, like
the coat of the cameleon, borrowing a different hue
from every passing cloud. There each different
sex, age, nation, rank, and profession, instead of the
strongly marked eastern distinctness of outlines,
on all sides only showed blending shades, evanescent
forms, prominences rubbed away, and features
confounded&mdash;tones, looks, and language,
varied only by gradations so imperceptible, by
shades so delicate, that a long study alone could
disclose the theory, and long habit alone teach the
performance of their ultimate refinements. There
the prejudices of the individual, constantly at variance
with the laws of the land, and the duties imposed
by religion, uniformly clashing with the latitude
required by custom, were each to be in turns
distinguished and yet blended, obeyed and yet disregarded,
without the act appearing an effort, or
the effect producing a discordance; nay, there
the mind, always kept on the stretch, was not even
allowed to unbend in repose after business was ended;

<!-- vol 3 page 353 -->

but must still, in the hours of leisure&mdash;not hours of
relaxation&mdash;encounter the new toil of constantly
supplying matter for discourse, suited at once to the
peculiar character of the speaker, and to those of
the diversified listeners.</p>

<p>Yet did it now become my task&mdash;alone, untutored
and uncounselled&mdash;to embody with my original
substance, ideas and habits, these intangible
new forms and these indefinable new shades, which
many of the natives themselves but awkwardly
wear,&mdash;and that at an age too when the cast of my
own character was stiffened into irremediable permanence
by the cold hand of time&mdash;on pain of exciting
the sneers of the cold, fastidious, unsympathizing
spectators of the new stage which I was
going, uncheered and unsupported, to tread.&mdash;Arduous
was the undertaking; small the hope of
success!</p>

<p>In fact, whether from the loss of health and the
prostration of spirits, under which I had laboured
ever since the last fatal pressure of my feet on the
shores of the East, or whether from the more appalling
form assumed by the new objects before me
as I advanced further westward, I every day began
to contemplate with increasing awe the idea of encountering
a new world with which I had nothing
in common. Every day that new world presented
itself to my imagination more as a gloomy desert, to
me without interest, without friends, and without

<!-- vol 3 page 354 -->

happiness. The people of Europe seemed heartless,
the virtues of the Franks frigid, the very crimes
of the West dull and prosaic; and I was like a
plant which, reared in all the warmth of a hothouse,
is going all at once to be launched into all the inclemency
of an atmosphere, ripe with chilling blasts
and nipping frosts.</p>

<p>Far therefore from waiting with impatience for
the period which was to dismiss me from the narrow
cell of my quarantine into the unlimited space of
this new scene, I could not help looking forward to
the awful moment with trepidation. As long as I
remained within the pale of the establishment devoted
to purification from my eastern stains, I felt
as if only standing on the extremest verge of my
native realms; as if not yet entirely removed from all
contact with the parental soil, and not yet entirely
beyond the influence of the paternal atmosphere; as
if still able to fall back at will upon the fostering
bosom on which I had been reared, and to regain
by a timely retreat all my native rights and privileges:&mdash;but
the threshold of the Lazaretto once
crossed; the barred doors of the quarantine yard
once closed behind me, it seemed as if a barrier
deep as the centre of the earth, high as the heavenly
vault, was to rise between the scenes of my youth
and the remainder of my dreary existence; as if
nothing that had been could preserve the least connexion
with what was still to be.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 355 -->

<p>When therefore the hour of my liberation struck;
when I was bidden to walk forth,&mdash;ready to take
my flight, and, like the bird driven from its downy
nest, to plunge into boundless space&mdash;I shrunk
back, and for a few moments still doubted whether
I should not after all forego my rash design, and,
instead of walking forth among strangers, rather
stay, and seek the first vessel in which I might
return to the genial shores of the East.</p>

<p>But one great, one mighty thought superseded
all others, and determined me to proceed. It was
not for myself I went,&mdash;it was for my child: it was
to perfect his education, to secure his future welfare,
to render him in all respects a man different
from his father. This idea gave resolution to my
wavering mind. I saw my luggage removed, took
my Alexis by the hand, and hastily walked out.</p>

<p>Yet when&mdash;arrived in the midst of the space that
separates the precincts of the lazaretto from the
remainder of the Malthese territory&mdash;I heard the
fatal gates, only opened to let me out, again close
with hollow clang, the awful sound went through
my inmost marrow; my heart seemed to sink within
me, and, turning round, for the last time to contemplate
the porch whence I had reluctantly gone
forth, I could not help once more bidding all I left
farewell. "Glorious sun of the East!" cried I with
faltering tongue, "balmy breath of the Levant!
warm affections of my beloved Greece,&mdash;adieu for

<!-- vol 3 page 356 -->

ever! The season of flowers is gone by: that of
storms and whirlwinds howls before me. Among
the frosts of the North I must seek my future fortunes:
a cradle of ice must rock my future hopes.
For the bleak wastes and black firs of Gothic climes
I am going to exchange the myrtle groves of Grecian
valleys; and, perhaps, on the further borders of
the chilly Neva, it may be my fate to cherish the
last remembrance of Ionia and of Chios!"</p>

<p>Thus saying, I took my cherub in my arms,
pressed him against my panting bosom, inclined my
face against his downy cheek&mdash;and went on.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious</span> to gain the place of my destination, I
hired a speronara to convey me to Sicily. As I
passed under the galleys in Valetta harbour, and
contemplated the batteries bristling on its shore:
"See," said to me one of my boatmen, "those engines
of war, employed to diffuse a religion of peace,
by men who take the vows of priests, and lead the
lives of soldiers. One would suppose man short-lived
and perishable enough by nature, to have no
need of so many contrivances of art still to abridge
his brief existence, and <i>that</i>, not piecemeal, but
wholesale: but so it is notwithstanding; and you
who come from Turkey, may perhaps smile to find
in Christendom the trade of inflicting death a favourite
livelihood!"</p>

<p>Etna fumed as I passed by: Charybdis shook,
and Scylla growled: yet did I land unimpeded at
Messina, and there soon re-embarked straight for
Naples.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this capital built upon a volcano
seemed to me completely gone out of their
senses. From the lowest lazzarone up to their fishing,
fowling, lazzaroni king, they were all rejoicing

<!-- vol 3 page 358 -->

in a peace just concluded with revolutionary France,
as madly as if war could thenceforth be no more. I
carried letters from Maltha to two personages of the
<i>nobilt&agrave;</i>, a gentleman and a lady; and had the extreme
satisfaction of finding myself recommended
by singular good luck to the two people in all
Naples who bore to each other the most inveterate
enmity. M. de Silva was a wit; and, in order to
ensure my success in society, took particular pains
to warn me against the least attempt at consistency
in my behaviour. "Like our bodies," he observed,
"our minds,&mdash;and consequently our opinions and
our feelings,&mdash;must necessarily change every day;
and he who, for the sake of that chimera consistency,
is determined ever to adhere to what in some
luckless moment he uttered, must sooner or later
renounce all pretensions to truth."&mdash;To Silva's
honour be it spoken; the doctrine which he
preached he likewise practised.</p>

<p>Me. de B&mdash;, being no wit, contended on the contrary
the more strenuously for that consistency,
which Silva regarded as the mark of a servile
spirit. It had not prevented her&mdash;it is true&mdash;from
changing her lovers very frequently: but that she
accounted for. Finding her speak philosophically
of her own proceedings, I begged of her one day to
explain to me how, with so much freedom of manner,
she had contrived to incur so little censure?
"By leaving my reputation," answered she, "as all

<!-- vol 3 page 359 -->

good christians should, entirely to Providence;
showing others the indulgence I wanted for myself;
and not imagining that I could whitewash my own
conduct, by blackening that of others." This was
not wit, assuredly, nor even a happy choice of metaphor;
but, to my mind, a sound, well-wearing sentiment.</p>

<p>Wishing to cultivate both my friends with equal
freedom, I took it into my head to patch up a peace
between them. This treaty presented greater difficulties
than had done that with France: for while Silva
maintained that many things might be better, and
was even supposed secretly to work at their improvement,
Me. de B&mdash; was for leaving every thing&mdash;her
complexion excepted&mdash;as she found it. "Were
we to live for ever on this globe," she used to say,
"there would be ample time for every experiment,
political as well as other:&mdash;but as matters stand, how
are those to be indemnified, who lose their lives in
the process before the end is obtained? What can
posterity do for them, that they should be happy to
die for posterity."</p>

<p>Upon the principle of not doing too much for
posterity, Me. de B&mdash; persevered in her <i>eloignement</i>
from Silva; who, in revenge, undertook to estrange
me from her parties; and for this purpose proposed
to take me to a dinner of certain literary friends,&mdash;"with
whom," he added, "it was absolutely necessary
that I should be acquainted."</p>

<p>I always bowed to necessity, which on this occasion,

<!-- vol 3 page 360 -->

however, seemed synonymous with impossibility:
for what chance had a stranger of slipping
in a word, or of obtaining an answer, with men
who had all rehearsed their parts beforehand?
Accordingly I hardly opened my lips; but Silva,
who fancied he had shone, returned home in raptures
with his day. "Had you sufficient quickness,"
cried he,&mdash;"barbarian as you are&mdash;to observe the
incessant circulation of the most ethereal wit? How
at first a few light sparks began to flash at random
from different points of the electric circle; each in
turns eliciting fresh scintillations from the opposite
quarter, until at last the whole table fired up into
one single uninterrupted blaze of the most brilliant
eloquence, repartee, and bon mot. What preparation,
what vigilance, what readiness such conversation
requires! What triumphs and what mortifications it
causes!&mdash;Depend upon it, the repose of half the
party has been disturbed for a fortnight, by the
good things the other half said this evening."</p>

<p>"Charming effects," cried I, "of a convivial
meeting!"</p>

<p>"And yet," resumed Silva, "you have not seen
the genius of the party: he likes to make himself in
request. To-morrow we go and rouse him in his
own den!"</p>

<p>A part of this den consisted of a handsome library,
into which visitors were shown, while the genius
of the place prepared for his impromptu effusions.
The levee had already begun. Three or four personages

<!-- vol 3 page 361 -->

occupied the farthest recess of the room.
One was humming a bravura air, as he walked backwards
and forwards, another accompanying it with
the steps and attitudes of a <i>pas seul</i>, a third poring
upon a huge folio of prints, and the fourth, the
moment we walked in, turned from us so abruptly
to admire a festooned bell-rope, that I never saw his
face.</p>

<p>My own attention was wholly engaged by the
books. Those I had seen at Pera seemed to me a
school-boy's bundle compared with this abyss of
knowledge. Besides the shelves against the wall,
absolutely bending under the weight of authors
already marshalled in regular battle array against
every denomination of ignorance,&mdash;some heavy
armed, others as light troops, others again as voltigeurs
belonging to no division in particular, but
hovering in turns over the outskirts of each, the very
floor was covered with piles of still unsorted science,
lying strewed about in a confused heap. I was
amazed at the sight. "How many square feet of
reading," cried I, "are here collected in one single
apartment! How many ideas, good, bad, indifferent,
true, erroneous and contradictory are jumbled together&mdash;some
lying, some standing, some on end,
and some, I apprehend, head over heels:&mdash;and will
my poor Alexis have to cram all this lumber into
his youthful brain, ere he can pass among Franks
for a man of understanding!"</p>

<p>"If he did," replied Silva, "I am afraid he

<!-- vol 3 page 362 -->

would scarcely have a spare corner left for his own
ideas: but the thing is wholly out of the question.
Formerly no dust equalled that of books for blinding
people's eyes; modern wits wipe it clean away:&mdash;they
write indeed, but only from inspiration. Even
philosophers have ceased to prize knowledge the
more for being at second-hand. Men of talent now
buy libraries only to shrug up their shoulders and
say 'they never read!' "</p>

<p>A clatter of doors, and a shuffle of slippers, now
announced the approach of the genius. He appeared
with locks dishevelled, and a wild stare&mdash;intended
for a look of inspiration; ran up to us in an
ecstacy; embraced Silva, then me; then asked who
I was; then congratulated himself upon beholding
a Greek, and me upon beholding him; then dragged
us by main force into what he called his sanctum;
then told us the quartetto we had left in his anteroom
consisted of a poet, a scene-painter, a musical
composer, and a ballet-master, all waiting his directions
for the new forthcoming opera; then complained
of the endless labours which his taste entailed
upon him; then showed us the list of the virtuosi
and virtuose he patronised; then ran out as if bitten
by the tarantula, to fix in writing a sudden thought;
then came in again making a thousand apologies;
then informed us that Horace had no energy and
Virgil no pathos; then recited an ode, three sonnets,
and half the first canto of an epic poem of his own
composing; then stopped to receive our applause,

<!-- vol 3 page 363 -->

and to contemplate his person in the looking-glass;
then took a few lozenges to ease his chest; then
asked me whether I did not infinitely prefer the
misty sublime&mdash;that of Ossian&mdash;to that of Homer;
then threw out a witticism or two, which he laughed
at most heartily, and we also out of complaisance;
then entreated to see me every day&mdash;except six of
the week, and the forenoon of the seventh, on which
he was engaged; then made an appointment with us
at the masked ball at San Carlo, and then dismissed
us, to return to the sons of Apollo whom he had left
in his library.</p>

<p>Forced to join the party to the masquerade, I
found but little pleasure in this to me novel entertainment.
At first indeed the sight dazzled, but it
soon tired, and at last annoyed me. I could not
get rid of a soothsayer, who had singled me out as
the object of his pursuit. Succeeding at last to take
hold of my arm, and putting his mouth to my ear:
"You think this form a borrowed one," he whispered,&mdash;"undeceive
yourself. People put on masks
to exhibit their characters undisguised. I see in
reality all that is hidden from others."</p>

<p>"Then who is it you are speaking to?" was my
first question.</p>

<p>"A stranger:" the answer.</p>

<p>"Doubtless! but from what country?"</p>

<p>"One to which you have sworn not to return."</p>

<p>"My name?"</p>

<p>"A Christian badge cast away among the Turks."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 364 -->

<p>"You have seen me unmasked."</p>

<p>"For that I must have seen you undressed:&mdash;your
present ordinary garb is itself but a mask assumed
very recently; and I know that which lies
deeper than even your inmost garment."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"An ass's skin!"</p>

<p>Here I began to wax wroth. "How so! are you
ashamed of a friend's last remembrance? Do your
Spiridion's tablets begin to lie heavy on your bosom?"&mdash;was
the query occasioned by my anger.</p>

<p>At these words my surprise increased. The
sacred memento was indeed composed of the substance
which bears the vulgar name<sup id="r303"><a href="#n303">303</a></sup> by which it was
specified: but to no mortal in Christendom had I
yet imparted its existence:&mdash;"Who can you be?"
cried I, more eagerly than before.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> I came not here to tell: but to-morrow
night at the same hour meet me here again; and
when you see me retire, dare to follow me."</p>

<p>I promised, and came:&mdash;we withdrew together;
and, after going the length of three or four streets,
the wizard entered a mean-looking house, where I
was ushered by him into a room dimly lighted, up
four pair of stairs.</p>

<p>Here my entertainer unmasked, and to my surprise
showed features of which I had not the smallest
remembrance. Still it was something to see a real
face of any sort in so suspicious a place.</p>

<p>"Now tell me"&mdash;said I . . . .</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 365 -->

<p>"Questions," interrupted the stranger, "are
here only answered by the dead: evoke whom you
please."</p>

<p>In faltering accents I named Euphrosyne. The
wizard shook his head. Then Helena:&mdash;he frowned.&mdash;Anagnosti
then! "What demon," he now cried,
"makes you enumerate all those whom you have
injured?"</p>

<p>"You cannot raise spirits," answered I sneeringly.</p>

<p>"Ere you judge, name some being you have
served," replied the wizard:&mdash;"Cirico for instance."</p>

<p>"Cirico is alive."</p>

<p>"He is dead: last night, at Alexandria, he fell
into a coma, and never woke again."</p>

<p>"Then be it Cirico:"&mdash;and Cirico appeared.
The poet so evidently showed as much of flesh
and blood as had ever entered into his spare composition,
that I ran to embrace him: but I grasped
only unsubstantial air! Startled at the circumstance,
I stepped back:&mdash;again the spectre advanced, and
probably by this time I looked a little scared; for
on the phantom opening its mouth to begin a solemn
speech, it fixed its eyes upon me, and burst out into
a loud peal of laughter.</p>

<p>"Where ghosts laugh," cried I, "there needs
must be a joke:" and I again sprang forward.
Again the figure vanished; but, now no longer

<!-- vol 3 page 366 -->

dismayed, I rushed on, overset every thing in my
way, and groped about until I hauled forth from
behind a table the real Cirico, whose image only I
had thus far seen, reflected by some optical contrivance.</p>

<p>"And so I catch you again," I cried; "and at
your old tricks too!"</p>

<p>"You do," was the poet's reply, "but no longer
unwillingly: however,&mdash;as this is but an uncomfortable
place,&mdash;we shall leave my Ga&euml;tano to settle
matters here, and adjourn to a coffee-house, where I
will tell you all."</p>

<p>Seated in the <i>bottega</i>, over our <i>rinfreschi:</i> "when
you quitted Egypt,"&mdash;began the improvvisatore,&mdash;"I
had just killed the last princess of my tragedy,
and secured the last sequin of my patron. It therefore
became expedient to return to Italy,&mdash;were it only
to claim that diamond on your finger there, which
you promised me for my services, but, in your fainting
fit on the beach at Alexandria, forgot to bestow.
A plausible pretence for leaving the Consul was
the least of my difficulties. I asserted that the
operas which I had spouted were mine: he claimed
them as his: we quarrelled, and we parted. I soon
found a passage straight for this place, and in this
place a patron in that transcendent genius under
whose roof . . . . ."</p>

<p>"I yesterday"&mdash;cried I, finishing the sentence&mdash;"met

<!-- vol 3 page 367 -->

you, afraid of being recognised, and in company
with a dancer, a fiddler, and a scene-shifter.
But take your promised stone, and . . . . ."</p>

<p>"Receive in return an unpromised billet-doux,"&mdash;resumed
Cirico, handing me a letter, of which the very
form and superscription bespoke a female writer.</p>

<p>"What," exclaimed I; "Apollo turned Mercury!"&mdash;But
my suspicions for once did the poet
injustice. The letter was dated from Alexandria,
and the signature, that of the consuless, my defeated
adversary.</p>

<p>"You know,"&mdash;she wrote, after some insignificant
preamble,&mdash;"how at Smyrna I found in a miserable
hovel an infant unblessed by a parent's care. Both
nurse and child were pining for want; both revived
under my roof: but soon the affections of the servant
wandered from her charge to a young taooshan,
while mine centred more every day in the lovely boy.
Seeing him hourly grow in all that is excellent, I
became so wrapped up in the feelings and duties of a
mother as to forget that there still existed a father&mdash;when
in an evil hour you appeared!</p>

<p>"Parental rights over the offspring of unwedded
love are unacknowledged in law, and by you could
not even be maintained in equity. Your child must
have perished but for the care of strangers: and,
after strangers alone had cultivated its young mind,
as well as supplied all its wants,&mdash;had alone rescued it

<!-- vol 3 page 368 -->

from ignorance and from vice, as well as from misery
and death,&mdash;it belonged not to you to reap what you
had not sowed. To have yielded up into your unhallowed
hands the angel, whose keen sensibilities I
had pledged myself, by the very pains bestowed upon
their cultivation, never to expose to the risk of being
wounded; to have tamely suffered that angel to pass,&mdash;as
it was likely to do under your guidance&mdash;not
only from consequence to contempt, and from care
to neglect, but from purity to corruption, and from
happiness to misery, I must have been bereft of
common humanity: and, had you possessed the
feelings of a father, you yourself must have wished
the tried and tender guardian of your offspring to
have ever remained, as she was become, its mother.</p>

<p>"You did not: you recovered your boy, and
rendered me anew childless. Yet such is the love
I still bear your Alexis, that for his sake I even
humble myself before you, and stoop to prefer a
prayer to him whom otherwise I must have cursed;&mdash;and
it is this: that you will duly weigh in your
mind the situation and prospects of which your
rashness has robbed your child, by wresting him
from my arms; and that you will thence deduce
how heavy is become in his behalf your own responsibility,
and how much it behoves you to do,
in order to make him amends for all he has lost.
Perform this with pious intentness; be as tender

<!-- vol 3 page 369 -->

a father in your more mature age, as you have been
a thoughtless one in the giddiness of youth; and
you may still at her last hour obtain the blessings
of the once happy</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Athenais</span>."</p>

<p>This letter leaving me little in a mood to enjoy
Cirico's humour, I went home immediately, and
over the very pillow of my child, already hushed in
sweet repose, vowed rigidly to perform its contents.
Many years before, I had received a similar appeal
to my parental feelings, in behalf of another ill-starred
offspring by another hapless mother, like Euphrosyne
deserted and dead. The two epistles seemed
intended for companions. "If I live," thought I,
"they shall be hung up in my chamber, be ever
under my eyes,&mdash;and, by deserving the blessings
promised in the one, I may perhaps still avert the
curses threatened in the other!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile I determined to hasten to my destination:
for so far from the pharmacop&oelig;ia of Italy
re-establishing my Greek constitution, I had fresh
and frequent returns of aggravated illness, and felt
anxious at least to leave my boy an orphan only
among such as were able to supply a father's care.
On mentioning to Silva my intention of quitting
Naples: "Good!" said he, "I too want to change
its air, in order to absent myself from a lady who
has made love to me so long, that she now persuades
herself it was I who made love to her, and resents

<!-- vol 3 page 370 -->

her own mistake as my infidelity. We will travel
together."</p>

<p>And so we did. For the first time in my life I
journeyed in a square box on wheels: the two
masters sitting face to face with their two servants;
while my little Alexis, the most delighted and
amusing of the party, placed in the middle, looked
like a gem surrounded by its inferior accompaniments.</p>

<p>As I approached the ancient mistress of the world,
the eternal city, the destroyer of Greece, my heart
beat high. But, alas! if he who names Rome
names energy, names strength, he who beholds
what remains of so much greatness, beholds nothing
but imbecility and impotence:&mdash;he beholds the prostrate
carcass of a giant, and foul corruption devouring
its remains. Sheep graze round the altar where
captive monarchs were slaughtered in honour of
Jove the great and the good, and silence reigns
in that arena where eighty thousand tongues at
once applauded the wretch, expiring in real torture
to represent some ancient fable. The very monuments
of a more recent date only arise, like fresher
weeds, out of the ashes of former decay:&mdash;they
are only the fungus, starting forth from the creviced
base of some nobler pile, and which, by
feeding on that fabric's costly substance, achieves
its destruction.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 371 -->

<p>Silva seemed to enjoy my disappointment; satire
was his profession. "These people," said he,
"cannot prevent the sun of their fine climate from
shining at its stated hours; but they make their
streets impervious to its cheering light:&mdash;a deep
gloom meets the eye wherever towers man's abode.
They cannot prohibit the rich vegetation of their
fertile soil from diffusing its fragrance; but they
collect every villainous odour to subdue nature's
sweets:&mdash;even amid their very orange groves loss
of scent would be a gain! They cannot cancel the
spring's ancient privilege of enamelling with flowers
the swelling hill and dimpled valley; but they
tarry in their fetid town till the magic has vanished,
and autumn embrowns both the garden and the
grove:&mdash;no one thinks of country rambles till summer
is gone by. They cannot stop the crystal rills,
while bubbling up in the mountain; but they suffer
the captive stream to ooze out of the aqueduct, and
to infuse pestilence into the marshy plain. They can
not dive into the inmost recesses of the human brain,
there to nip in its very first germs every brightest
faculty; but, conducting the developments of the
human reason as the Chinese do those of their peach
and plum trees, they encompass each tender shoot
of the intellect with so many minute fetters, religious,
political and social, that dwarfs are produced
where giants were intended. Their manuscripts

<!-- vol 3 page 372 -->

are not suffered to be inspected; their pictures
are left to rot; their very city has been
allowed to slip from its seven hills into the sink
between. They clip their trees into men, and
their men into singers. In their vaunted last
Judgment heaven appears far more dismal than
hell. Their law deems infamous not the thief, but
the magistrate&mdash;the bargello. Their tribunals sell
justice to the highest bidder; their churches screen
the criminal; and the huge temple on which we
now stand" (for from St. Peter's proud dome went
forth this bitter diatribe)&mdash;"built at the expense of
the whole Roman world, on a foundation which
stands awry, and with a cupola which yawns with
rents,&mdash;contains absolutions for every sin, as well as
confessionals appropriated to every language. The
seclusion of the convent is the school of the sovereign;
the renouncement of the world the preliminary
to ruling the state, and the decrepitude of old
age the chief recommendation in the candidate for
the supreme power. Vigor to hold the reins of
empire is a motive for exclusion from the pontifical
throne: those who aspire to govern, must renounce
connubial bliss; and all chance of a lawful lineage
must be foregone, ere those honours are attainable,
which man elsewhere seeks chiefly for the sake of
his offspring. Hence nephews step into the place
of sons; and the very policy of the statesman becomes

<!-- vol 3 page 373 -->

doubly crooked, from the oblique direction
given to his affections. The word virtue indeed exists
in the language, but is applied to skill in singing;
and as to valour, the former signification of the same
word, it is a quality which during so many ages has
been let out for hire, first in the gross by the condottiere,
and next more in detail by the professed
bravo, that those disclaim it who value their character,
and cowardice, under the name of caution, forms
not only the privilege of the priest, but the pride
of the cavalier. Visit a friend in the daytime, and
he surveys you through a grated hole in his entrance
door, ere he dares to let you in: venture out at
night, and from a distance you are bidden to avert
your eyes, lest one murder witnessed should necessitate
a second. The very head of the church,
when in the holy of the holies, dares not take the
consecrated wine except through a gilded reed,
lest his lips should suck in poison; and in the heart
of his capital the pontiff of Rome keeps in his
pay, for the safety of his person, the rude mountaineer
of Swisserland, as your Turkish pasha does
the barbarian from Epirus and from Coordestan.
Thank God! however, this mass of imbecility and
vice hies fast to its fate: for if by a late submission
which the Romans call a treaty, the rotten grant
of St. Peter's rich domain is yet saved a while from
utter ruin, its seals are all torn off, and its ornaments

<!-- vol 3 page 374 -->

effaced.<sup id="r304"><a href="#n304">304</a></sup> Nature herself conspires with man
in the work of just destruction. In that sky so
transparent lurks a permanent poison, which, formerly
only creeping like the adder along the hollow
valley, now soars like the eagle above the steepest
hill, and invades the last abodes once safe from its
intrusion. Thus shall soon the world's ancient
mistress again return to nought; and as the herdsman
erst wandered in solitude where Rome in later
days arose, so shall the herdsman again wander in
solitude where Rome has ceased to be."</p>

<p>Silva here ending his effusion, we again began to
descend the thousand and one steps which we had,
to my great fatigue, ascended. In the midst of our
downward progress my companion abruptly stopped
short, as if struck with a sudden thought. "So
near the abode of your ancient Gods," he cried,
"they might feel offended if we did not pay them
a farewell visit, previous to their forced departure
for the banks of the Seine. This is their
second grand removal since the days of Praxiteles.&mdash;Let
us go to the Vatican, and see them packing
up."</p>

<p>Already tired, and somewhat peevish with increasing
weakness: "Am I not sick enough"&mdash;cried
I,&mdash;"of real man, that I must run after his image
in stone and brass?" but Silva overruled my ineffectual
resistance. When indeed I beheld what

<!-- vol 3 page 375 -->

were called the Apollo, the Mercury, the Jupiter,
the Venus, and the other gods and goddesses of
my forefathers, I cannot deny that I felt pleasure.
"And can these fair forms"&mdash;thought I to myself&mdash;"have
been the production of demons and of witchcraft?
Can it be Satan that smiles on those lovely
lips? If so, ah! who could withstand his wiles?"&mdash;and
with one deep sigh my heart absolved all
paganism. I almost wished to have lived in those
ages and amid that worship whose wrecks still
looked so attractive; and I repined at the gloom
of a religion whose temples, adorned like charnel-houses,
display even in the freshness of the finest
marbles, the features of death and the forms of corruption.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we reached our lodging when Silva
was called upon by a friend, who advised him to
leave Rome immediately, lest he should be entombed
alive in the mausoleum which emperor Adrian only
destined for his repose after death.</p>

<p>"What have I done," cried Silva, astonished,
"to be thus treated to the honours of a state criminal?&mdash;Assassination,
blasphemy, profanation
would have been overlooked in this indulgent
place: but can I have said that the Pope starved
his subjects to enrich his nephew Braschi, or that
the nephew sold the state to buy the Pontine
marshes?&mdash;can I have maintained that prince

<!-- vol 3 page 376 -->

Borghese's gems were modern, or princess Lanti's
charms antique?&mdash;In fine, can I have admired Pasquino's
wit, or abused Pius's leg?"</p>

<p>"You once returned a bow from the arch-fiend
Cagliostro," answered the friend;&mdash;"and asserted
that free-masonry and treason were not always synonymous."</p>

<p>"If so," exclaimed Silva, "let us depart this
instant! From real offences I might, at Rome at
least, have escaped. With imaginary crimes there
is no contending."</p>

<p>Accordingly we set off the same evening, in the
very teeth of the still white and threatening Apennines.
I left a hundred plans unexecuted and performances
unfinished, connected with my Alexis;
but I thought myself bound in honour not to stay
after Silva. On contemplating from the last hill
which allowed a view of Rome, as if painted with
a delicate pencil on the bar of gold left by the setting
sun, that long range of purple domes so
beautiful in its appearance, and yet destined to
so speedy a decline, I felt, amid my own accelerating
steps towards dissolution, some comfort in
the thought that, like the lowliest individuals, the
proudest empires of the present day were hastening
to a certain and proximate end.</p>

<p>The ascent of the mountains seemed to last an
eternity. At Narni we found every horse in the

<!-- vol 3 page 377 -->

place engaged for Arezzo; at Terni the same; and
the same at Spoleto. Nor was it otherwise at
Foligno. I began to complain, but excited little
sympathy. "When saints perform miracles," was
the answer, "sinners should stay at home." A person
inclined to cavil might have replied that three
drunken cobblers reeling in a wine-vault could
see the madonna roll her eyes about any where as
well as at Arezzo:&mdash;but the prodigy was become a
mine of wealth to its before distressed church, and
I held my tongue. "Truth," as Silva observed,
"is a bad travelling companion."</p>

<p>After passing through several cities which looked
like the deserted habitations of the Titans, in which
had crept a race of pigmies, we arrived at Loretto,
where, pulled one way by a guardian of the
holy house, anxious that I should wipe away my
old sins, and the other by a fair vender of crucifixes,
desirous that I should commence a new score,
I was only saved from leaving my cloak in the
hands of the syren, by a pilgrim who had stolen it
before.</p>

<p>At Ancona Silva pressed me to go on with him
to Venice. "The sun of St. Mark indeed is set,"
he cried:&mdash;"its proud aristocrats were so long
considering to whom they should sell themselves,
that the bargain was struck at last without their
participation: but, though Austria has finally swallowed

<!-- vol 3 page 378 -->

up the fat and torpid oyster of the lagunas,
the empty shell still glitters, and is worth beholding."</p>

<p>"Silva,"&mdash;was my answer, "were I still the man
I was, I might perhaps (whether right or wrong)
wish to become something more than a mere spectator
of European changes. At a moment when all
the old monarchies of the west are ploughing up to
receive the new seeds of a more promising system,
I might myself like to assist in somewhere planting
that tree without roots, of which the fruits are yet
worth gathering: but you need only look at me to
see that the gods no longer permit my health the
exertion, or my spirits the hazard. Here,"
added I,&mdash;laying my hand on the curly head of
my child,&mdash;"is the sole remaining object of all my
solicitude. Him I wish to place in a safe harbour.
Do you then jolt on to Venice. As to me, I must
be carried, as it shall please the winds and waves,
to Trieste."</p>

<p>And ill it pleased these capricious, these democratic
powers, to smooth my journey in the small
felucca in which I embarked on the morrow of my
boy's fifth birth-day. Scarce had we been six
hours at sea when there arose from the north-west
a most tremendous storm. We closed our hatches,
took in as much sail as possible, and prepared to
meet the hurricane. Every instant it increased,
and the sea soon running mountain high, thenceforward

<!-- vol 3 page 379 -->

kept our starboard completely under water.
At last the vessel sprung a leak, and the hold filled
so fast, that nothing was thought of any longer but
working at the pumps. Even I, as soon as I had
seen my poor child lashed to his crib, fell to work
with the rest&mdash;though small was my strength, and
trifling my assistance.</p>

<p>Contrary to every suggestion of common sense,
the re&iuml;s resolved to run in between the nearest islets
on the coast of Dalmatia. It was in vain to represent
the danger of striking against some hidden
reef, or stranding upon a lee-shore; and we only
wondered which of the two would be our fate,
when providentially the storm abated as suddenly
as it had arisen, and enabled us with our ship full
of water, and our rigging all in tatters, to put into
a little creek on the island of Melada. Here we
found a Ragusan vessel, driven in by the same
storm, but with a miserably foul bill of health,&mdash;insomuch
that the crews unguardedly mixing, we
learnt to our great dismay that we must make up
our minds, on our arrival at Trieste, to a fresh
quarantine.</p>

<p>I now recollected that just at midnight, and when
the storm was at its height, a tremendous flash of
lightning had during an instant shown me the
frightful spectre ship, ever hurried, as they told me,
with growing speed round the globe, and announcing

<!-- vol 3 page 380 -->

destruction to the crews which beheld it. The
vision appeared as if advancing full sail to run our
vessel down; then vanished as by magic, and left no
trace behind. Immediately the storm was hushed,
the wind dropped, and all the danger of a shipwreck
ceased. The plague seemed therefore the foe by
which&mdash;I concluded&mdash;we were to fall:&mdash;but on
inquiry, none save myself had seen the phantom.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 381 -->

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the damage was repaired, we again
hurried on board, and put to sea. All now looked
most propitious. Nothing could exceed the serenity
of the weather: we scudded right before the wind,&mdash;become
a gentle but steady breeze; and, though
my health had not greatly benefited by my late
severe labour, yet the sea air seemed a balm, sent
to soften the ailments produced by the sea water.
My aches were less acute, and my spirits more buoyant
than they had been for some time past, and, as
I lay on the deck basking in the April sun, with the
purple dolphins sporting round the ship, and my
own little cherub playing by my side, more visions
of delight danced in my imagination than there
sparkled liquid diamonds upon the azure wave.
With that yet untasted repose which I should now
soon enjoy, my inward sores, I thought, might still
slowly heal; or, if I was doomed never more to
recover my former vigour, what then? It was neither
in the pal&aelig;stra nor on the race-ground that I
proposed to shine. I should only be the fitter for
that tranquil life, henceforth the only object of my
tempered wishes. My cousin's letter had promised

<!-- vol 3 page 382 -->

me a brilliant lot, and&mdash;what was better&mdash;my own
pockets insured me a decent competence. The refinements
of an European education should add
every external elegance to my boy's innate excellence,
and, having myself moderately enjoyed the
good things of this world, while striving to deserve
the better promised in the next, I should, ere my
friends became tired of my dotage, resign my last
breath in the arms of my child.</p>

<p>The blue sky seemed to smile upon my cheerful
thoughts, and the green wave to murmur approbation
of my plan. Almighty God! what was there
in it so heinous, to deserve that an inexorable fate
should cast it to the winds?</p>

<p>In the midst of my dream of happiness, my eye
fell upon the darling object which could alone render
that dream a reality. Insensibly my child's
prattle had diminished,&mdash;the cheerful sound of his
voice had subsided in an unusual silence. I thought
he looked pale: his eyes seemed heavy, and his
lips felt parched. The rose, that very morning
still so fresh, so erect on its stalk, at mid-day hung
its head, discoloured, wan, and fading:&mdash;but so
frequently had the billows, during the pitiless storm,
drenched my boy's little crib, that I could not wonder
he too should have felt the effects of their protracted
fury, at least in the shape of a severe cold. I put
him to bed, and tried to hush him to sleep. Soon
however his face grew flushed, and his pulse became

<!-- vol 3 page 383 -->

feverish. I failed alike in my endeavours to procure
him repose, and to afford him amusement:&mdash;but,
though playthings were repulsed, and tales no
longer attended to, still could he not bear me an
instant out of his sight; nor would he take any
thing except at my hands. Even when&mdash;as too
soon it did&mdash;his reason began to wander, his filial
affection seemed only to cling the more firmly to
his heart. It had grown into an adoration of his
equally doting father; and the mere consciousness
of my presence seemed to relieve his uneasiness.</p>

<p>Had not joy, just before, possessed me so entirely,
alarm would not so soon have mastered my
whole being: but I had throughout life found
every transport of happiness, much exceeding the
ordinary measure, followed by some unforeseen
calamity; and my exultation had just risen to so
unusual a pitch, that at once my dismay became
proportionably deep. A sense of dreadful apprehension
soon completely chilled my blood: I felt
convinced that I had only been carried to so high
a pinnacle of joy, in order to be hurled with greater
ruin into an abyss of woe. Such became my
anxiety to reach Trieste, and to obtain the best
medical assistance, that, even while the ship continued
to cleave the waves like an arrow, I fancied
it lay like a log upon the main. How then did my
pangs increase when, as if in resentment of my unjust

<!-- vol 3 page 384 -->

complaints, the breeze, dying away, really left
our keel motionless on the waters! My anguish
baffled all expression.</p>

<p>In truth I do not know how I preserved my
senses, except from the need in which I stood of
their aid:&mdash;for while we lay cursed with absolute
immobility, and the sun ever found us on rising in
the same place where it had left us at setting, my
child&mdash;my darling child&mdash;was every instant growing
worse, and sinking apace under the pressure of
illness. To the deep and flushing glow of a complexion,
far exceeding in its ominous brilliancy even
health's rosiest hue, had succeeded a settled, unchanging,
deadly paleness. His eye, whose round
full orb was wont, when I appeared, to beam with
filial love, now sunk, dim, and wandering, for the
most part remained half closed; and when&mdash;roused
by my address&mdash;my angel child strove to raise
his languid look, and to meet my fearful glance,
it was to show all the mild radiance of his countenance
extinguished. In the more violent bursts
indeed of his unceasing delirium, his wasting features
sometimes acquired a fresh but sad expression.
He would then start up, and with his feeble
hands clasped together, and big tears rolling down
his faded cheeks, beg in heart-breaking terms to be
restored to his home: but mostly he seemed absorbed
in inward musings, and&mdash;no longer taking

<!-- vol 3 page 385 -->

note of the passing hour&mdash;he frequently, during the
endless day, moved his pallid lips in low but earnest
speech,&mdash;as if repeating to himself the prayer which
his sweet voice used to pour forth, at bed-time and
at rising; and the fervent imploration of Heaven's
blessing, added to it by his father, in behalf of his
mother. If&mdash;wretched to see him thus, and doubly
agonised to think myself the cause&mdash;I burst out into
tears which I strove to hide, his perception of outward
objects seemed all at once for a moment to
return. He asked me whether I was hurt, and
would lament that, young and feeble as he was, he
could not yet nurse me as he wished;&mdash;but promised
me better care when he should grow stronger.</p>

<p>In this way hour after hour and day after day
rolled on, without any progress in our voyage;
while all I had left to do was to sit doubled over my
child's couch, watching all his wants, and studying
all his looks,&mdash;trying, but in vain, to discover some
amendment. "O for those days!"&mdash;I now thought,&mdash;"when
a calm at sea appeared an intolerable evil,
only because it stopped some tide of folly, or delayed
some scheme of vice!"</p>

<p>At last, one afternoon, when, totally exhausted
with want of sleep, I sat down by my child in all
the composure of torpid despair, the sailors rushed
in one and all:&mdash;for even they had felt my agony,
and doted on my boy. They came to cheer me

<!-- vol 3 page 386 -->

with better tidings. A breeze had just sprung up!
The waves had again begun to ripple, and the lazy
keel to stir. As minute pressed on minute, the
motion of the ship became swifter; and presently&mdash;as
if nothing had been wanting but a first impulse,&mdash;we
again dashed through the waves with all our
former speed.</p>

<p>Every hour now brought us visibly nearer the
inmost recess of the deep Adriatic, and the end of
our journey. Pola seemed to glide by like a vision:
presently we passed Fiume: we saw Capo d'Istria but
a few minutes;&mdash;at last we descried Trieste itself!
Another half hour, and every separate house became
visible; and not long after we ran full sail into the
harbour. The sails were taken in, the anchor was
dropped, and a boat instantly came alongside.</p>

<p>All the necessary preparations had been made for
immediately conveying my patient on shore. Wrapped
up in a shawl, he was lifted out of his crib, laid
on a pillow, and lowered into the boat, where I held
him in my lap, protected to the best of my power
from the roughness of the blast and the dashing of
the spray, until we reached the quay.</p>

<p>In my distress I had totally forgotten the taint
contracted at Melada, and had purposed, the instant
we stepped on shore, to carry my child straight
to a physician. New anguish pierced my soul,
when two bayonets crossed upon my breast forced

<!-- vol 3 page 387 -->

me, in spite of my alternate supplication and rage,
to remain on the jettee, there to wait his coming,
and his previous scrutiny of all our healthy crew.
All I could obtain as a special favour was a messenger
to hurry his approach, while, panting for
his arrival, I sat down with my Alexis in my arms
under a low shed which kept off a pelting shower.
I scarce know how long this situation lasted. My
mind was so wrapped up in the danger of my boy,
as to remain wholly unconscious of the bustle
around, except when the removal of some cask or
barrel forced me to shift my station. Yet, while
wholly deaf to the unceasing din of the place, I
could discern the faintest rumour that seemed to
announce the approaching physician. O how I
cursed his unfeeling delay: how I would have paved
his way with gold, to have hastened his coming!&mdash;and
yet a something whispered continually in my
ear, that the utmost speed of man could no longer
avail.</p>

<p>Ah! that at least, confirmed in this sad persuasion,
I might have tasted the heart-rending pleasure
of bestowing upon my departing child the last
earthly endearments!&mdash;but, tranquil, composed, and
softly slumbering as he looked, I feared to disturb
a repose, on which I founded my only remaining
hopes. All at once, in the midst of my despair, I
saw a sort of smile light up my darling's features,

<!-- vol 3 page 388 -->

and, hard as I strove to guard against all vain illusions,
I could not at this sight stop a ray of gladness
from gliding unchecked into my trembling
heart. Short however was the joy: soon vanished
the deceitful symptom! On a closer view it only
appeared to have been a slight convulsion which
had hurried over my child's now tranquil countenance,
as will sometimes dart over the smooth mirror
of a dormant lake the image of a bird in the air.
It looked like the response of a departing angel,
to those already on high that hailed his speedy
coming. The soul of my Alexis was fast preparing
for its flight.</p>

<p>Lest he might feel ill at ease in my lap, I laid
him down upon my cloak, and kneeled by his side
to watch the growing change in his features. The
present now was all to me: the future I knew I no
longer should reck. Feeling my breath close to his
cheek, he half opened his eye, looked as if after a
long absence again suddenly recognising his father,
and&mdash;putting out his little mouth&mdash;seemed to crave
one last token of love. The temptation was too
powerful: I gently pressed my lip upon that of my
babe, and gathered from it the proffered kiss.
Life's last faint spark was just going forth, and I
caught it on the threshold. Scarce had I drawn
back my face, when all respiration ceased. His
eye-strings broke, his features fell, and his limbs

<!-- vol 3 page 389 -->

stiffened for ever. All was over: Alexis was no
more&mdash;Euphrosyne avenged,&mdash;and Anastasius the
wretch he had long deserved to be!</p>

<p>I shed no tears; I moaned not; I made myself
not a spectacle for the gaping multitude: but,
ordered to the lazaretto, I threw my cloak over
what had been my heart's best treasure, and, with
the sacred burthen in my arms, silently proceeded
to where I was shown my temporary prison. There,
in the lonely cell allotted for my more favoured confinement,
I found leisure to make myself acquainted
with my grief, and to contemplate in its altered, its
new condition, that countenance, that form and those
features, once all the company I coveted upon this
globe, and now leaving me in solitude, though
placed by my side.</p>

<p>At the outset of my voyage from the East, when,
on recovering my scattered senses, the first object
which met my eyes was my adored child,&mdash;when,
after infinite toil and misgivings, I saw my Alexis
at last safe in my possession,&mdash;I had, in all the ecstacy
of unutterable joy, fallen on my knees beside the
sweet babe wrapt in soft slumbers before me; and
had almost worshipped him as the pledge of my
indestructible felicity. Now, at the close of the
same voyage, and arrived at the place of my long
looked-for destination, but with my hopes entirely
blasted, my happiness destroyed, and the being in
which centered my existence no more, I knelt a

<!-- vol 3 page 390 -->

second time, in an agony of grief beyond all
utterance, beside that same beloved boy, again
lying before me, but&mdash;a breathless corpse! At first
indeed I gazed as if insensible of the awful change.
My mind was so confused, so bewildered, that&mdash;perhaps
from excess of grief&mdash;I seemed not to feel
at all, and could only upbraid myself for my strange
insensibility. My imagination refused to conceive
that lovely frame, so lately still the seat of the
warmest affection and the tenderest piety, as nothing
now but a clod of icy clay, unconscious of my anguish,
insensible to my embrace. Steadfastly as I
contemplated my wretchedness, it was so great that
neither eye nor intellect could compass its extent;&mdash;and
for a while I thought I must be labouring
under some dreadful dream, whose illusion would
vanish, and whose end would be my waking.</p>

<p>But when from the object immediately before
me I carried my eye to more distant points, to
wider circles of time and space;&mdash;when I reflected
that on my child alone I had built all my remaining
prospects of earthly comfort and joy; that for my
child alone I had left home, friends, and country,
to encounter strange regions, climes, and people;
that to my child's converse alone I looked for all
the solace of what few days were still vouchsafed
me, as well as to his piety for the few flowers that
at my death might deck my bier; that in his beloved
arms I had hoped to breathe my last; nay, that

<!-- vol 3 page 391 -->

a thousand times, in the idle fancies of my entranced
brain, I had flattered myself with leaving him such
a blessing to the world, as by the virtues of the son
to atone for the sins of the father, and to cause the
sire himself to be blessed in his offspring; and when,
from these excursions of my distracted mind, I
reverted to what was left me of these fond and
foolish visions,&mdash;then it was that my grief at last
forced its way through the stupor by which it
seemed compressed, and that the flood-gates of my
tears, long locked, at last burst open. Then did my
increased agony find vent, and no longer wear the
semblance of a stone-like apathy.</p>

<p>It was not my child whose change demanded
pity. He had indeed, by my ill-fated fondness,
been torn from a scene of every bliss which could
surround his tender years. From a nursery of comforts
he had been taken by force on a journey of
privations and perils, and his series of youthful sufferings
had ended in a painful illness, and a premature
death:&mdash;but what of that? Heaven, it has
long been acknowledged, marks its special favourites
by an early removal from this abode of sorrow.
My child's short cares were over, and his irksome
career closed at its very outset. He had quitted
a world of bitterness and corruption, ere yet his
susceptible heart had felt its cruel thorns, or his
pure mind had been sullied by its foulness. Called
away while, in the gay spring of his existence, tears

<!-- vol 3 page 392 -->

only soft as April showers had yet bedewed his
rosy cheeks, he had been wafted on high, still
robed in all the brightness of his native innocence;
and, ere his guileless mind could yet have lost aught
of its holiness, he had joined his brother angels in
the realms of bliss eternal. There&mdash;while his father
was still struggling on the stormy sea of life,&mdash;he,
already safe from ill, dwelt in endless glory in the
bosom of his Maker.</p>

<p>But I&mdash;I alone&mdash;remained oppressed by a weight
of woe unutterable! Partly by chance and partly
from my own fault, every relation, every friend, every
common acquaintance with which I had commenced
life&mdash;estranged by degrees through my own wayward
conduct&mdash;had left me a being wholly insulated,
precisely at that age when, weaned from a
deceitful world, man begins to want comfort at
home. Frightened at my increasing loneliness, I
had in my turn looked out for a something on
which to bestow those affections, doomed to run to
waste just as they began to rise. Long I sought;
often fancied I held, and often again either cast
away or lost the prize. At last Heaven seemed to
pity my loneliness, and to favour my search&mdash;to
smile upon a feeling so blameless. After much
anxiety and sore disappointment, I found the wished-for
solace,&mdash;and found it in my own child, long
severed from my arms.</p>

<p>Him I beheld where I could least have expected

<!-- vol 3 page 393 -->

it: him, after much fear and doubt, I regained;
and him I thenceforth destined to become my only
stay,&mdash;the support and the joy of my remaining
life. That, with regard to this last and dearest
treasure of my soul I had, for once, acted up to my
fair intentions and fulfilled all my duties, my heart
bore me witness. From the moment my Alexis
was mine in reality as in thought, he became the
sole object of my unceasing solicitude, the sole
theme of my constant contemplation. Casting off
all other cares, spurning far away from me all
other vain pursuits; no longer caring for aught of
which he was not the sole end and motive, nor engaging
in aught which promoted not his benefit, I
devoted to him all the strength of my body, and all
the powers of my mind: I watched over his development
by day and by night.</p>

<p>Heaven seemed for a while determined to reward
with its utmost liberality so irreproachable a sentiment.
Almost from the first hour of my possessing
him I reaped every day some fresh fruit of
my care, and received earnests every day of far
richer fruits still ripening. My Alexis possessed
exquisite faculties; and the slightest culture sufficed
to elicit them. At first indeed he had looked upon
me as an enemy; as one who had torn him forcibly
from his friends: but at last,&mdash;and when convinced
by my tenderness of the excess of my affection,&mdash;he
had realised all my long trembling hopes; had fulfilled

<!-- vol 3 page 394 -->

in every way all my most ardent wishes; had
begun to return my undivided fondness with all the
fervour of his own affectionate disposition. No
child ever doted on a mother as he did on his
father:&mdash;and, if our love even becomes riveted to
an object by the mere unrequited care and pains
bestowed upon it, how unbounded became, with
the return which I experienced, my adoration of my
angel child, need or can I describe! He alone was
the joy of my eyes, and the pride of my vain glorious
heart; and, as I walked forth with him in public;
as I saw every stranger gazing on his lovely countenance,
smiling at his playful prattle, and almost
spell-bound by the charm that seemed to hover round
his person, parental exultation swelled that foolish
heart within me, and made my eyes overflow with
rapturous delight. I seemed only to move along,
for the purpose of enjoying a constant triumph.</p>

<p>Nay,&mdash;that parental fondness which, bearing in
all its parts on one single point, and in that single
point finding the firmest support, must under any
circumstances have acquired an unexampled intensity,
had still had its growth accelerated beyond
the ordinary measure, by the peculiarities of my
anomalous condition.</p>

<p>That very same instant which had, on Egypt's
barren shore, brought my labours for the possession
of my child to a happy conclusion, was also that
which witnessed the beginning of my incessantly

<!-- vol 3 page 395 -->

continued journey, toward the distant point which
was to be my final goal, and where I hoped to sit
down at last in peaceful enjoyment of the treasure
I had won. From the momentous period which
had seen my Alexis first pressed to my still panting
bosom, every later successive day&mdash;nay, almost
every successive hour&mdash;had beheld me wafted to
some new point under the heavens, to some new
latitude on the earth, wholly distinct and different
from the preceding ones. No region, no city, no
abode had, since my departure from Alexandria,
afforded me a permanent sojourn, or fixed me long
enough to excite in my breast the smallest local attachment,
the least fondness of which I had not
brought the seeds in my own bosom:&mdash;or, should
even in any place some slight interest have arisen,
not unlawful in itself, and which might in a more
stationary condition have been allowed to take some
hold of my heart, have covered with some fair exotic
the spots left bare by the native attachments eradicated,
and have in some degree divided my affections
with my soul's chief treasure,&mdash;bereft, from
the ever changing scene through which I hurried,
of all leisure for its cultivation, I had sedulously
crushed its first shoots, as those of an intruding
and troublesome stranger.</p>

<p>But the more my state of incessant locomotion
had thus made all else pass by unregarded, or unable
to leave any permanent impression, the more

<!-- vol 3 page 396 -->

had it caused my own child, my only never failing
companion, to entwine himself with double force
round every fibre of the paternal heart:&mdash;for, at the
same time that that constant impulse forward which
both sire and son obeyed had suffered no other
object to enter into the smallest competition with
my boy for my genuine affections, it had occasioned
an uninterrupted closeness in my daily intercourse
with him, had demanded on my part a minuteness of
parental offices with respect to his little person, had
given me a habit of unremittingly hearing his sweet
voice, nay had, amid all this seeming sameness of
sentiments and impressions, thrown a variety in
the places, the modes, and the circumstances of
our relative existence and endearments, infinitely
exceeding what any different and stationary condition,
even with my Alexis&mdash;and no one else but
that dear child&mdash;clinging to my side unceasingly,
could have ever afforded. The short, the happy
period of my life, marked by the recovery of my
Euphrosyne's last bequest, had offered the treasure,
not merely&mdash;as does in most cases so short a possession&mdash;in
one place, one occupation, one shape:
it had offered my Alexis, while constantly placed
in view, yet constantly in a different form, and
action, and mode of being: it had offered him successively
in Egypt, at Maltha, in Sicily, at Naples,
at Rome, at Ancona, and in every place either of
repose or thoroughfare, intervening between these

<!-- vol 3 page 397 -->

distant points: it had offered him in capitals and
on the road, at rest and in action; now gliding in
a light skiff on the waves, now whirled on smoking
wheels over hill and dale; now wondering at the
sights of cities, now enjoying rural pastimes and
scenery; now in the simple garb of the infant traveller,
now gorgeously attired to attract the public gaze;
now all alertness, and rousing by his arch and playful
caresses even his listless father, now himself oppressed
with the fatigues of the journey and asleep
in my arms: and thus I had gone on from place to
place, collecting and compressing in a small space
a variety of pictures of his infantine person, pursuits
and adventures&mdash;all lovely and yet all different&mdash;far
beyond what the longest period of years could
have accumulated in the slow changes of a stationary
existence; and which, carefully treasured up in
my memory, and always present to my imagination,
had furnished by their multitude materials for
an affection and a worship, far exceeding what even
tender parents, but distracted by a variety of ties,
can find to divide among their numerous offspring:&mdash;and,
at the eve of accomplishing my labours and
reaching my destination, this all absorbing adoration
of a child in appearance not less exuberant
in bodily health than moral excellence, was already
ushering me into a scene of lawful and rapturous
felicity only expected to end with my own
life, when all at once a Providence&mdash;mindful of my

<!-- vol 3 page 398 -->

sins when I had forgotten them&mdash;had even reversed
the course of nature to cut short that existence
on which my own depended, to destroy at one
blow my new and hard earned happiness, and to
leave me, from one possessed of all his heart desired,
a forlorn wretch in a strange country and
among a stranger race;&mdash;with not one object to
cling to on this side an obscure and lonely grave.</p>

<p>Yet with such dismal thoughts rending my mind,
and the more dreary object laid out before my eyes,
did the benumbing powers of affliction itself&mdash;of an
affliction perfect in all its parts; of an affliction no
longer leaving room for hope or fear, no longer
affording an excitement or permitting a struggle&mdash;
at last procure me a short respite from its sting.
Yielding to the torpor which by degrees came over
my senses, I fell into a profound sleep; and the
trance lasted unbroken until the dawn of the following
day: but the moment of waking was dreadful
beyond all former moments. I had dreamed
of my child; I had, in the lying vision, seen him
convalescent: my heart's treasure had again seemed
to revive, and to thank me for a care no longer
wanted, when&mdash;awaking with a burst of joy, and
turning round&mdash;I saw . . . . O God of heavens!</p>

<p>I now gave way afresh to my despair; with frantic
violence hugged to my bosom the cold corpse of
my boy, and swore no earthly power should tear it
from my arms,&mdash;until by degrees the mild entreaties

<!-- vol 3 page 399 -->

of my fellow prisoners made my grief assume a less
insensate form.</p>

<p>After frequent relapses I prepared to perform to
my child's sad remains the last duties of a man, a
Christian, and a father. In the gloomy precincts of
the lazaretto I saw the narrow cell hollowed out,
which henceforth was to hold all I cared for on earth.
Then, kissing for the last time those faded eyes
which never more were to beam upon me, and those
livid lips which no longer felt the pressure of mine,
I suffered the dreary winding-sheet of death to
shroud from my further view my angel's altered
features; and carried him weeping to his last home:
but when the moment came&mdash;after the priest had
concluded his office&mdash;to lower into the foul jaws of
the grave, and to resign to corruption that lovely
body&mdash;that last relic of my short lived felicity, I
scarce felt courage for the dismal task: I clung to
what I was going to lose, until fresh violence became
necessary; and when over the idol of my boastful
heart I again beheld the ground made like all
other ground: "Now come," cried I, "whenever
it list, my own final hour! I shall hail it as the
healer of sorrows; as the friend who springs forward
to receive suffering man, when all other
friends depart."</p>

<p>Sad indeed was the void which I found from
those days, when I could not go out even for a few
minutes, without paying the tribute of a farewell

<!-- vol 3 page 400 -->

embrace, and could never come home without finding
a sweet welcome awaiting me on the very
threshold: when every look of sorrow I betrayed
was met by filial sympathy, and every glance of
satisfaction I gave filled my child's heart with gladness.
Ah! while I drank daily draughts of these
unutterable raptures, the very confinement of a
lazaretto had been a scene of joy: now that they
were to be no more, the liberation from my prison
only promised fresh grief.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the period of enlargement came:&mdash;for
the quarantine had only been incurred by an
untoward accident; and in a very few days I received
a formal notice that its term had expired.
Once more I went to the hallowed spot where lay
buried all my hopes, and once more bedewed its
turf with bitter tears:&mdash;then, retiring with slow
and lingering steps, I left the sad enclosure, and
launched forth again into the haunts of men.</p>

<p>But I re-entered them without joy, as I did without
anxiety. Things gone by no longer gave a
value to things to come. The golden link which
had so gloriously conjoined the past and the future
had been riven&mdash;been snapped asunder. The Anastasius
of the morrow was no longer the Anastasius
of the eve. The wide new world which I was
going to tread, was a world devoid of interest;
and the vast new prospects unfolding to my view,
were prospects without life, animation, or sunshine.

<!-- vol 3 page 401 -->

Struck by heaven's vengeful lightning, my soul saw
nothing in the dark surrounding waste to cheer its
death-like sadness, and shrunk from every slightest
exertion as from an Herculean labour. On every
stone I met in my way, I could have laid me down
to die.</p>

<p>My only consolation consisted in the multiplicity
of my sufferings, and in the sage speculations of the
medical professors whom I consulted on my health
merely to get rid of the gratuitous prescriptions
of the multitude: for though the members of
the faculty seemed to think it likely that the effects
of the storm at Melada, the anxious watching
during my child's illness, and more than all, the
grief for his loss, might have very much aggravated
the symptoms of the original complaint, yet
they agreed unanimously that, even without these
additional circumstances, the internal injury received
on the beach at Alexandria&mdash;whether in the
lungs, or the liver, or the spleen, no matter,&mdash;must
still alike have ended in my not very distant demise:
and, what cruel regret, what dire forebodings
must have disturbed my death-bed, had I
been obliged to leave my Alexis in a strange land
a helpless unprotected orphan, exposed not only to
all the violence of the rapacious but all the wiles
of the profligate, and perhaps, in the weakness of
unsuspecting childhood, not only stripped of his
property, but despoiled&mdash;for ever despoiled&mdash;of his

<!-- vol 3 page 402 -->

more precious innocence, were what I even now
shuddered to think of. The dread of such consequences
must have rendered the last hour of my
life the most painful of my existence. Instead of
that, my child's short account on earth was closed
for ever, ere the least alloy of evil could dim his
spotless purity:&mdash;his bliss eternal was sealed beyond
repeal. Of his endless happiness no doubt could be
harboured any longer. Self, worthless self was all I
henceforth had to think of; and the pangs of that
self alone to lessen&mdash;if I could.</p>

<p>And even of these too well deserved sufferings
the sting was greatly blunted&mdash;the edge was removed&mdash;by
the consciousness that their period was
limited. My loneliness upon earth could not be
of long duration; my punishment here below must
soon draw to a close: nay, the very torments that
might, in the severity of eternal justice, await me
hereafter, would be soothed by knowing that my
child shared not in them, but, while his father paid
the penalty of his manifold offences, enjoyed in other
realms the reward of his piety:&mdash;and I sometimes
even presumed to think that perhaps, after so dire an
affliction, so severe a trial as that which concluded
my earthly career, some portion even of my own
heavy debt might be remitted,&mdash;when the last
moment of my stay here below, which the parting
from my still earth-bound child must have rendered
the most irksome of my life, would, by reuniting

<!-- vol 3 page 403 -->

me for ever to my angel above, become the
most blessed of my unwished-for existence.</p>

<p>Meantime,&mdash;a stranger in the place to which my
destiny had brought me, and not ranking among
those privileged children of the globe, licensed to
indulge to the utmost of their wish in every luxury,
even unto that of grief&mdash;I felt I must bestir myself,
under pain of being, like a bruised reed, crushed
and flung on the dunghill. What was life after all,
but an <i>aria di bravura</i> such as I had heard at
Naples;&mdash;often performed with an anguished heart,
but which, when once undertaken, we must achieve
in the best way we can! Accordingly I resolved, if
dead to pleasure, at least to rouse myself to business,
and, hushing in my heart those gnawing sorrows
which no one around me could share in or
alleviate, again prepared to look, to speak, and to
act, in public, like other men.</p>

<p>My first exertion was to inquire after the kindly
intentioned kinsman, whose invitation had brought
me to Trieste, but whose existence I had for a time
wholly forgotten. On waking from my trance and
remembering my relation, I rather wondered that he
should thus, in my distress, have kept aloof. Alas!
he too had, since I last heard from him, paid the
debt of nature, and disabled me from paying that of
gratitude. I say of gratitude;&mdash;for, though his
will had been left in the main as it stood before my
journey, it had been amplified by a handsome legacy

<!-- vol 3 page 404 -->

in my favour, to soften my disappointment, in case
I should be found to have complied with his summons.
The bequest put me at once in possession
of a considerable sum of ready money, when I would
have wanted spirits to convert into cash my now
loathed jewels.</p>

<p>Trieste, which I had before intended to make
my permanent residence, was become since my misfortune
the place least fitted for my abode. Not
only the living multitudes of a commercial city
had not leisure to sympathise with my situation,
but the very inanimate objects it presented were
of the sort most discordant with my present frame
of mind. Those rocks which, left in their native
ruggedness, would have harmonised with my gloomy
feelings, here were only beheld shaped in bustling
quays and busy wharfs: those forests which, abandoned
to silence and solitude, might have favoured
my melancholy musings, here were only to be
viewed transformed into noisy hulks and naked
masts. Gold was the only substance worshipped
on this altar of Mammon in its pure primitive
shape; but gold was precisely the only production
of nature which I would rather have seen, by a
later transformation, converted into whatever could
have afforded my mind some abstraction from its
sorrows. I therefore thought that, if I returned
at all among my fellow creatures, it should only be
where I found them collected in such myriads, as

<!-- vol 3 page 405 -->

to recover amidst their overflowing crowds all the
privileges of solitude. Upon this principle Vienna
became destined in my mind for my ultimate abode.&mdash;There
I might try to acquire the miserable happiness
which was to depend upon forgetting.</p>

<p>While I stayed at Trieste, however, people would
insist upon diverting me. It was a difficult undertaking,
with my mind full of sorrow, and an abscess
forming in my side. Once only, finding myself
somewhat easier than usual, I abruptly left my
couch, and indulged my curiosity by creeping to a
party.</p>

<p>I own that, when launched into its vortex, and
beholding a number of figures towards whom I felt
no attraction either of kindred, country, or even
common interests, amusements or language, whirl
around me in idle hurry, nay, sometimes stop in
the midst of their inane bustle to look at myself, to
point me out to each other, and to see how my
adventures sat upon me;&mdash;reflecting moreover how
soon even this mere spectacle must to me cease
altogether,&mdash;I felt a sort of pleasure. But it was
the pleasure of one who wanders in the delusion of
a morning dream through imaginary meads and
gardens, among phantoms flitting about him in
their twilight revels; and who feels all the while
that they only wait, to glide off and disappear, for
that approaching dawn which must break his sleep,

<!-- vol 3 page 406 -->

and cause his final waking among scenes and beings
of a different nature.</p>

<p>Loth to leave the place where slept my Alexis;
loth to quit the last shore to which my child had
been wafted,&mdash;finding my only solace in listening
day after day on the quay facing the lazaretto,
to the surf beating against its piers in slow and
solemn pulses,&mdash;I do not know how long I might
still have remained at Trieste, taking no account
of time, but, while ever intending to go, ever putting
off my journey, had not the fear of travelling
late in the season made me resolve, before the
summer should wholly pass by, to secure my winter
quarters.</p>

<p>Not long therefore after the memorable treaty
of Campo Formio, which filled Trieste with joy
by annihilating Venice, a brilliant autumn eve saw
brought to their conclusion the short preparations
for my departure the next morning.</p>

<p>My bills paid, my passports signed, my post
horses ordered&mdash;having nothing further to think
of or to settle in the place I was leaving,&mdash;I went
to take my last turn on my favourite quay.</p>

<p>The sun was just dropping behind the purple
expanse of the Adriatic, and I, indulging my
favourite dream, that perhaps the glorious luminary
which not only through its constant emanations
supports the inferior surrounding planets, but by

<!-- vol 3 page 407 -->

its central situation is itself exempted from all the
vicissitudes they suffer, might be the first halting-place
of the blessed that depart from other orbs,
and in its bright bosom might harbour my own
Alexis,&mdash;when I was diverted from this object of
vague and distant contemplation by one less remote,&mdash;namely
two persons, apparently just released
from quarantine, who were advancing towards the
city, and consequently towards me. They wore
the Greek dress, and, common as the sight was at
Trieste, it yet engaged my attention as one which
would become rare on my impending removal.
Of the two strangers the shortest particularly attracted
my notice. As he approached, a crowd of
confused images rushed upon my mind. I almost
fancied I saw . . .! but the thing seemed improbable;&mdash;and
yet, at every successive step which
brought him nearer, the impression, so far from
lessening, acquired greater strength,&mdash;until at last
I grew quite convinced of its truth. The person I
gazed upon must be&mdash;it was Spiridion! Spite of
his darker complexion and his more manly form,
I no longer could doubt I beheld the fond friend of
former days. As to himself,&mdash;intent upon the
surrounding scenery&mdash;he would have passed me by
unheeded, but for my stopping directly in his way,
in order to take one more silent survey of his person,
ere I ventured to hail my long estranged companion.</p>

<p>Thus pointedly approached, he looked at me in

<!-- vol 3 page 408 -->

his turn, first indeed with an expression only of
surprise at such a scrutiny from one in the Frank
attire; but, by degrees, with a more fixed stare&mdash;as
if he thought himself under a delusion which he
wanted to shake off. He gazed alternately on my
features, which proclaimed an old friend, and on
my dress, which bespoke an entire stranger.</p>

<p>Human patience could hold out no longer:
"Am I then so changed," cried I, "that even my
Spiridion cannot recognise his&mdash;I would have said,
once beloved&mdash;Anastasius?"</p>

<p>My voice was still the same. At its once familiar
sounds the son of Mavrocordato seemed seized
with a sudden thrilling, and again stepped back:
but this time in wonder&mdash;in amazement.</p>

<p>"And is it then really," cried he at last, "Anastasius
I behold?"</p>

<p>Nothing but diffidence, the tardy offspring of
misfortune, had prevented me, the moment I recognised
my friend, from clasping him in my
arms. Could I have suspected that without the
same cause on his part, he would have evinced a
similar hesitation to press me to his bosom, no
temptation would have induced me to make myself
known. I would have let him pass by unstayed;
and never&mdash;no! never would I again, with my
consent, have thrown myself in his way. His
cold reception chilled me to the heart and paralysed
my tongue. Spiridion saw me appalled,
and Spiridion&mdash;I thought&mdash;enjoyed the sight!&mdash;for,

<!-- vol 3 page 409 -->

without one single word to relieve my embarrassment,
he waited in solemn silence my tardy and
faltering speech. His looks seemed to say: "each
his turn: yours came first."&mdash;And yet, no cold or
calculating motive could have found access to his
breast,&mdash;to that breast pure and generous as the
sun. But he had witnessed all my errors, and he
knew not my repentance.</p>

<p>For this, however, I made not at the time the
allowance which was due:&mdash;"Spiridion," cried I,
as soon as I felt able to speak; "your searching
eye need not tell me what I already know too well.
I no longer am he who looked defiance at all on
earth; and at Heaven itself. Sickness and sorrow
have bent me to the ground;"&mdash;and, overcome by
my recollections, I burst into tears.</p>

<p>A slight blush now tinged Spiridion's cheek.
In a faltering voice he attempted an excuse&mdash;probably
as little understood by himself as it was by
me; and, labouring to repress a rising emotion,
told me where he meant to lodge, and begged I
would call upon him.</p>

<p>Thus constrained in his very apologies, he only,
in trying to withdraw the dagger thrust into my
bosom, gave me fresh pangs. I inclined my head
to thank him, but raised it with a glance of conscious
independence, and, leaving to the friend of
my youth, as my last legacy, a faint smile of reproof,
darted away.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 410 -->

<p>As soon as Spiridion was out of sight I turned
back, and went home. All my business at Trieste
was concluded. I determined to set off immediately.
My chaise was brought round: the horses put to
it, and my trunks fastened on.</p>

<p>Among the stones reserved from Khedieh was a
singularly beautiful ruby. Often pressed to sell the
precious gem, I had always refused to part with my
carbuncle. It had been set apart to please my own
eye&mdash;perhaps, some day, to purchase a powerful
patron. But to pleasure I was become indifferent,
and I no longer needed an earthly patron. I slipped
the sparkling stone, wrapped up in paper, between
the folds of Spiridion's own pocket-book, which till
now had never been out of my bosom, and, putting
the still valued memorial under cover, sent it to
my old companion with the following superscription:</p>

<p>"To one who for his friend once gave up all,
and whose devotion is best remembered when it
no longer can avail, Anastasius&mdash;rich in worthless
jewels, poor in all beside&mdash;sends this last token of
ancient affection, and of endless gratitude."</p>

<p>No sooner was the parcel out of my sight, than
I too departed.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="v3ch16">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was my intention to have travelled all night:
but at the second stage want of horses stopped my
progress. I therefore desired some refreshment, a
fire, and a bed. The stove was lighted, a slice of
cold meat set before me between a bottle of wine
and a flask of more potent spirits, and, in answer
to the last of my requests, the female who acted as
waiter pointed to a huge mountain of eiderdown,
in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>Having finished my supper, and hanging over
the slowly warming stove, I insensibly fell into a
review of all the various and motley vicissitudes
which had marked my portion of that changeful
dream called human life. First I went back to its
remotest periods, to those passed in the place of
my nativity; played over all the gambols of my
infancy, and all the frolics of my boyhood; viewed
in its minutest details the paternal abode, remembered
the most trivial incidents of the family circle,
and heard the peculiar sound of voice of each of its
members&mdash;their gossip, their scolding, and their
loud peals of laughter, with a distinctness and a

<!-- vol 3 page 412 -->

proximity which left the memory of the more important
events of later years comparatively vague,
dark, indistinct reminiscences. With the rekindling
of my youngest flame, and with the retracing of
my earliest flight,&mdash;that disgraceful flight which
cut me off from all connexion with the land of my
birth, and entirely divided the first stage of my life
from all its later periods,&mdash;I closed the first chapter
of my history.</p>

<p>Scarce could my heart even now refrain from
bounding, as I recalled the rapturous intoxication
of my spirits, when, in the morning of my days,&mdash;like
the young pilgrim with locks flowing in the
wind, and wallet carelessly flung across the shoulder,&mdash;I
set out upon the second stage of my journey
through life: when, simply but smartly attired, the
soft down just budding on my lips, and the infant
hopes expanding in my mind, I went forth with
erect crest and buoyant step, in quest of pleasure
and of fame; and finally, when in the Morea,
reaping an ample harvest of both, I achieved my
first prowess, and heard my first praises. Hassan's
lip had long been silenced by death; but the music
of his applause still rung in my ears.</p>

<p>Launched next into the maddening vortex of
the capital, I still smiled at the recollection of the
Jew doctor, shuddered at that of the Bagnio, and,
though quite alone, averted my eyes as from a
spectre, on remembering Anagnosti, pale, bloody,

<!-- vol 3 page 413 -->

and with my murderous dagger buried in his
breast! To fly the ghastly image I crossed the raging
main, roamed in the plains of Egypt, and, after seeing
myself successively a kiashef rioting in luxury,
and an outcast fleeing for his life, I in turns became
a humble hadjee crawling on his knees at Mekkah,
and a conceited coxcomb sporting his saucy wit at
Stambool.</p>

<p>Now rose predominant the figure of my friend
Spiridion! I mean the Spiridion all heart, all affection,
of former days,&mdash;between whom and his
namesake of yesterday the connecting link seemed
wanting. Parted, by my own fault, from my only
real friend, I again roved, successively a soldier of
fortune at Cairo, a warrior in Wallachia, and a
merchant on the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>But Ismir! But Euphrosyne!&mdash;The thought
harrowed up my soul. To pluck the gnawing
worm from my bosom, I plunged into the deepest
desert, and joined the most daring of sectaries.
At last, become a tender husband, I suffered for
my sins in my amendment, and soon consigned to
earth a fond and virtuous wife; when&mdash;spurned by
one friend as I had spurned another&mdash;I fled to
Arabs less godly but less faithless than the Wahhabees,
and, under their new banners, founded my
worldly fortune in the plains of Khedieh. Growing
a coward as I grew rich, I pursued&mdash;loaded with
rubies and clothed in rags&mdash;my solitary course

<!-- vol 3 page 414 -->

towards the setting sun, till, casting off my slough
in the concealment of the capital, I flew on the wings
of parental love to the coast of Egypt;&mdash;and at
Alexandria, sought, saw, and won my child!</p>

<p>Oh! that I could here end my last chapter: that,
to so many friends and relations, protectors and
protected, one after the other swept away from the
earth, I had not to add . . . . . . but so it was!&mdash;and
now, with all that I looked forward to of joy,
of pride, and of stay, laid prostrate for ever, I had
nothing left me, but to sink irretrievably under one
of those sorrows the more corroding, because they
are unshared, unnoticed, unimagined by the surrounding
throng;&mdash;and to waste away my small
remnant of life in tears resembling the rain drops
that fall into the sea, untold, unheeded, and without
leaving a trace.</p>

<p>Such was the feeling of sad, of entire abandonment
in which my reflections terminated, that, to
drive them away and to warm my withered hearty
I rapidly drank off several draughts of the spirits
placed beside me: after which, without undressing,
I crept under the towering feather bed, desiring I
might be called the instant the horses&mdash;expected
home in the night&mdash;were ready to take me on.</p>

<p>In bed I found sleep, but not repose. A feverish
restlessness insensibly grew as it were into a continuation
of the last adventures of my life. I fancied
myself dead, and lying in my coffin. The dim

<!-- vol 3 page 415 -->

tapers already cast on the space around the funereal
glare which was to light my stiffened body to
the darkness of the grave. Yet had I a faint perception
of what was going forward. My limbs indeed
were immoveable; but my eyes beheld, and
my ears retained the power of hearing.</p>

<p>First appeared, as in a twilight, the persons most
closely linked to my existence: my parents, Helena,
Mavroyeni, and others. Their busts&mdash;for nothing
more of them was perceptible&mdash;seemed floating in
air. Sometimes they advanced as if to take a nearer
look at my countenance, gazed some time on me in
silence, and then again retired, making room for
other ghosts waiting behind them, who in their turn
performed the same evolutions, and, after sating
their curiosity, equally vanished in space. Two
persons only of the mute assemblage remained,
after all the rest had disappeared. At first they
presented no features which I recognised, but insensibly
they assumed the resemblance, the one
of Euphrosyne, the other of a venerable priest
whom I had seen at Pera. Euphrosyne began by
contemplating me awhile like all the phantoms
that had preceded her, in total silence, and, though
seeming to smile sweet forgiveness on her unfeeling
despoiler, wore a funereal look which thrilled me to
the soul. She repeatedly beckoned to me with emphatic
gesture to join her: but each time my leaden
limbs refused to do their office. At last the old

<!-- vol 3 page 416 -->

man spoke.&mdash;"In vain," he cried, "you try to meet.
Your paths in life lay too far asunder."</p>

<p>"Ah!" now exclaimed in her turn the weeping
maiden&mdash;whose voice, till then unheard, thrilled
me to the soul:&mdash;"if he cannot come to me, I can
at least go to him!"&mdash;and with outstretched arms
she sprung forward to share n:iy baleful destiny;
but her lifeless form only fell like a millstone on
my chest. Gasping for breath, I struggled to disengage
myself from the oppressive load,&mdash;when,
suddenly, what I held in close embrace no longer
was Euphrosyne, but&mdash;the fiend Sophia!</p>

<p>Rage now swelled my breast, as fury flashed from
the eyes of my antagonist. The lion and the serpent
grappled. Each fixed his fangs in the other's quivering
flesh: each strove to pluck the heart from
the other's bleeding bosom:&mdash;until at last the baseless
ledge on which we fought in air gave way under
our feet.</p>

<p>Twined in each other's arms, down we now sank
together; and I continued falling, until I woke at
last in inexpressible horror, and found myself lying
on the floor of the room, weltering in a stream of
real blood, drawn forth from my vitals by my unconscious
exertions. The confusion of my ideas
just left me time enough to rejoice that I had only
been dreaming, ere returning perception brought
to my remembrance how much here was, in my
frightful dream, of sad reality.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 417 -->

<p>Scarce inferior to the fancied music of the spheres
themselves, sounded at that moment in my stunned
ear the hoarse note of the horn, which informed
me that the driver was seated on his horse. Ill as
I felt, I thought I could not get away too fast. The
post-master indeed had informed me of a novelty,
only witnessed since these before peaceful regions
had become the seat of war; namely, robbers prowling
in the neighbourhood. But who durst lay unhallowed
hands on the already sentenced criminal!
My death warrant, long signed, kept my life charmed
until the hour of its lawful execution; and evil
glances fall not more innocuous on spirits broken
by adversity, than would the deadliest dagger on
my heart, already turned to stone by grief.</p>

<p>Disregarding therefore every entreaty, every
sinister foreboding of the landlord and his crew,
I wrapped myself in my cloak, stepped into my
calesh, and spite of the still undiminished darkness,
again rolled on with renovated speed.</p>

<p>All that day, and all the ensuing night, I continued
travelling without interruption: for, greatly
as I wanted rest, I could nowhere bring myself to
stop. It was only in proportion as I felt my body
whirled along with greater speed, that my mind
seemed to find somewhat more repose. A mysterious
impulse, as it were, goaded me on without
ceasing.</p>

<p>The sun of the third day was already lengthening

<!-- vol 3 page 418 -->

the partial shadows that precede its disappearance,
when I entered an extended heath, to whose
beautiful and varied weeds heaven's declining luminary
lent at that instant the glowing transparency,
which announces its proximate setting. With singular
force did the gaudy scene revive all the deep-felt
impressions which objects of a similar description
had once made on my younger mind in the plains
of Ak-hissar:&mdash;or rather, it produced one of those
moments in my life, when my sensations became so
exactly the counterpart of what they had once been
at some definite prior period perhaps long gone by,
as to suggest the idea of my having, in a new point
of space, reverted to an already experienced point
of time; and of my going over afresh some former
portion of my existence, already elapsed.</p>

<p>And, in fact, may not things created perform
circles in time as they do in space? May not the
limited scope of our present perceptions be alone
the cause that prevents our embracing the vast revolutions
produced by duration, as we compass the
smaller circuits performed within the equally incomprehensible
boundaries of extension?&mdash;and may not
one of the brightest prerogatives of that more perfect
promised state when time is said to cease, consist
in that removal of its partial barriers, through
means of which we shall be permitted equally to see
the past in the future, and the future in the past?</p>

<p>Be that as it may:&mdash;no scene could, in the

<!-- vol 3 page 419 -->

splendor of its detail, exceed the one which my
mind thus irresistibly retraced. Every where a
carpet of anemones, hyacinths, and narcissuses
covered the undulating ground. The oleander,
the cistus and the rhododendron, blushing with
crimson blossoms, marked the wide margins of the
diminished torrents: glowing heaths, odoriferous
genistas, thyme, lavender, and jesmine, started from
every fissure of the marble-streaked rock; while its
projecting crags were clothed in a moss of emerald
green, through which trickled diamond drops of
never failing water. Alternate tufts of arbutus, and
mimosa, and bay, intermixed with the wild rose and
myrtle, canopied the beetling brow of the precipice;
but from the deeper bosom of the dell between,
shot up like stately pillars supporting fretted arches,
the ilex, the poplar, and the wide spreading plane.
Here and there a presumptuous creeper&mdash;wily sycophant,
raised by his very pliancy&mdash;overwhelmed
with parasitic blossoms the topmost boughs of the
tree on which it had fastened, and from its supporter's
mighty limbs again fell in gay festoons to
the ground. The air was loaded with fragrance:
birds of every hue balanced their light forms on
the bending twigs, and myriads of gilded insects
emulated in brilliancy the flowers, round whose
honied cup they vibrated their glassy wings.</p>

<p>Yet,&mdash;while other artists prize their meanest productions,

<!-- vol 3 page 420 -->

nature often seems to set so little value
upon her choicest works, that this paradise lay in a
secluded nook, far not only from the more beaten
track of the traveller, but even from the haunts of
the thinly scattered natives. No path ran through
it in any direction: its very outskirts were scarce
ever pressed by the stray foot of man, and its inmost
recesses had not perhaps for centuries been
darkened by his shadow. Every where the most
lovely plants sprung up and again faded every year,
without a single instant meeting the human eye:&mdash;but
the concealment of these wonders produced not
the least slackening in their progress: the activity of
nature was not checked or diminished by the ignorance
of man! Still did each later season see each
varied form of vegetation, reckless of human blindness,
expand at its due period, blow its full time in
all its wonted splendor, and perform every successive
function of its maturation and seeding, as it had
done each former year.</p>

<p>Had I thence only inferred how little that self
assumed lord of the creation, man, has of value in
the eyes of Providence, even on that very globe of
which he calls himself the master, and which he
considers as created for his sole use and purposes,
the induction would probably have been just, though
thus far little consoling:&mdash;but I went further. Since
it seemed incompatible with all perfect wisdom that

<!-- vol 3 page 421 -->

wonders, capable of affording exquisite delight,
should be endlessly renewed, only to be endlessly
unenjoyed&mdash;endlessly wasted, I inferred that even
our own humble globe might be visited, unknown
to us its ostensible tenants, by higher beings than
ourselves, hovering in purer forms over their primitive
haunts, and mixing unperceived with their
still mortal kindred. Who could tell that the spirit
of my own Alexis&mdash;wafted on the sun's untiring
beams from its higher abode&mdash;might not at times
flit among them; might not have sat on yon fair
tulip which I so fondly gazed upon, and which bent
its graceful head as I slowly passed by?</p>

<p>But does my mind wander already?&mdash;thus to
swerve from my narrative:&mdash;On, on, my pen!
Time runs short: I must hasten to the goal.</p>

<p>Some little perverse incidents, indeed, seemed now
and then to start up, as if on very purpose to keep
it longer in prospect. My carriage broke down at
one place; in another I myself was stunned by
a fall:&mdash;but these incidental rubs affected me no
longer. The single deep affliction which encompassed
my heart served as an impenetrable &aelig;gis
against all lesser ills. It rendered me impervious
to their superficial punctures. Never emerging
from that twilight in which there are no partial
shades, since there are no partial lights, my mind,
no longer accessible to hope, no longer felt the
pressure of disappointment.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 422 -->

<p>A little before the dawn of the fourth day, however,
there arose a somewhat singular circumstance,
which affected me sufficiently to give a new direction
to my movements. A pretty sharp ascent had
made me alight among the Carinthian hills, in order
to walk a few yards, and shake off the morning chill
by which I felt quite benumbed. The road lay
across a dark forest of firs, whose outline already
was marked by the pale light of daybreak against
the cold grey sky, but whose deep bosom still presented
unbroken all the black and mysterious indistinctness
of night. The trees in their funereal
hues seemed sable mourners, gliding in long procession
down the hills to witness my passage: the
bleak winds breathed through their waving boughs
deep and mournful sighs; and the torrent, dashed
from rock to rock, roared with hollow murmur in
the abyss below.</p>

<p>All at once I heard&mdash;or thought I heard&mdash;a dismal
moan, as from one in pain. I stopped, held
in my breath, turned my ear the way whence proceeded
the sound, and, from within a close thicket
not thirty yards distant, fancied some one addressed
me the following words: "Speed on, Anastasius;
thou hast not far to go."</p>

<p>My blood curdled in my veins: a chill of terror,
unknown before, crept over my whole frame; I felt
an inward shudder,&mdash;yet I determined to look bold.
But, though I dashed like one delirious among

<!-- vol 3 page 423 -->

the rustling bushes, I found no trace of mortal
man!</p>

<p>My first attempt was to laugh off the incident.
No one joined in my uninfectious mirth; and soon
the forced smile died away on my own lips.</p>

<p>Whether, however, the ominous words had actually
vibrated on my ears, or had only rung in my
heated brain, what did it signify? There needed
not an express message from the shades below, to
inform me that my company was waited for in other
realms; that, with a frame rent at every joint, I was
at best but a vampire, only permitted to walk among
the living, until the last awful summons should fix it
for ever among the vaster myriads already under
ground. After a long period of very little change
in my bodily state, I had felt my sufferings increase
so rapidly since the fatal dream at the first stage from
Trieste, that I could almost by the regular and distinct
progress of my declension, compute the utmost
term I might reach, and the hour at which my last
sand must run out, and make me bid this world
farewell.</p>

<p>And little&mdash;in truth&mdash;did I reck my hastened fate.
Even in my fullest vigour both of body and of mind,
I had often prayed that I might not grow old,&mdash;had
endeavoured only to crowd events so thickly within
the definite span of my existence, that its varied recollections
might make my career, however short,

<!-- vol 3 page 424 -->

appear longer on retrospect than the longest life of
dull undistinguished uniformity.&mdash;"Rather,"&mdash;had
I often exclaimed&mdash;"let me even be felled to the
ground, while an ample store of verdant boughs may
yet grace my prostrate head, than be permitted to
wither from old age on my very stalk, unable to offer
any attraction or to resent any injury, and indebted,
as for an obligation, to those who merely suffer my
presence. Let me not outlive all those from whom
I might have obtained a passing tear, only to excite
derision in those destined to outlive me!"</p>

<p>And now that health and spirits were already
drained to the last drop;&mdash;now that, cankered by
an inward worm, each bough already hung completely
faded, and not a single shoot remained
fresh and blooming, to cheer by its later spring my
own untimely autumn;&mdash;now that both what I
loved best and what I hated most had already attained
the final goal before me,&mdash;could I still wish
to live&mdash;to live alone in the universe, without a
spark of affection or even of animosity left glowing
in my bosom, to light with its fire my last lingering
steps? Could I brook to stand, like the scathed
oak in the wilderness, a conspicuous monument of
heaven's fiercest wrath?&mdash;God forbid!</p>

<p>Then, what was the use of torturing my worn out
frame, only to seek far away what I might find so
near? I could die any where.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 425 -->

<p>Immediately I formed my resolution. Two
stages back I remembered being struck by the appearance
of a fir-clothed cottage, close to a country
town, whose few inhabitants&mdash;kept up somewhat
later than usual by some festivity&mdash;had attracted my
notice by their cheerful clusters. "Might not"&mdash;
thought I&mdash;"that gold, now become so indifferent
to its weary possessor, obtain me the loan of this
coveted habitation, for the short time my body
wanted one above ground?"</p>

<p>This I determined to try: but found obstacles
to my scheme even sooner than I had expected.
My driver was of the true German breed&mdash;an automaton
who, throughout the whole length of his
stage, could only move according to the impulse
given him on setting out. The advantage of receiving
full payment for a task only half performed,
was what his brain refused to conceive: only, he
never had heard of people stopping half way on
their journey, to turn back to whence they came;
and he never should&mdash;God helping&mdash;lend his assistance
to such an innovation. The cane was
shaken in vain at this imperturbable idiot,&mdash;even
the pistol's threatening muzzle made to exert its
dumb oratory close to his ear, without the smallest
effect. The immoveable <i>schwager</i> would rather be
shot dead on the spot, than submit to become instrumental
in the nefarious deed of turning his

<!-- vol 3 page 426 -->

horses' heads, even to save the weary beasts the toil
of half a stage: so that my servant had to pull him
at last from off his brother brute, and to usurp his
lawful place, ere I could effect my retrograde movement:&mdash;nor
did I consider this as one of the least
achievements of my life.</p>

<p>Equally arduous did I, on my return to L&mdash;,
find the main business which brought me back.
The owners of the cottage&mdash;dull plodding people
like the postboy&mdash;wanted time to consider of my
singular proposal. They could not resolve on such
a measure in a hurry: and the first determination
they were able&mdash;after much hesitation&mdash;to come to,
only consisted in a promise of the habitation at a
period so remote, that I must have taken possession
of a more lasting mansion long ere it arrived.
Even when afterwards the wary couple agreed&mdash;on
the strength of my ill looks, and hollow cough&mdash;to
let me have the hovel immediately for the whole
term of my life, they still evinced some desire of
inserting as a clause in the lease, <i>when</i> I was to die.
At last, however, through dint of constantly enhancing
my offers, every difficulty yielded. I took
possession of my cot, and my tenacious landlord
went away, half grumbling at his good bargain,
half grinning at my strange whim, and wondering
at the stranger price I paid for its indulgence.</p>

<p>The last stage of my terrestrial journey thus

<!-- vol 3 page 427 -->

achieved, the last place of halting on this side the
house to be changed no more, thus occupied, I
immediately made the few arrangements necessary
for the comfort of my transient abode, and sent for
a physician from the neighbouring town, to render
my bargain as little losing as possible. On examining
my symptoms the sage shook his head, and
judiciously observed that I might linger a good
while yet, or might die very soon; but would do
well, at all events, to follow his prescriptions. His
medicine I received, and only took care not to
waste the precious compound on my incurable ailments;
notwithstanding which cautious conduct my
weakness soon increased to such a degree, that a walk
round my garden became an exertion.</p>

<p>Near me lived a young couple, whom my other
neighbours made the constant theme of their praise:&mdash;and
most disinterested it seemed; for the husband
had only gained, by serving his country as a soldier,
some severe and painful wounds, while the wife had
lost, by preferring the wounded soldier to a hale
peasant with a heavy purse, the countenance of all
her kindred. In return she had secured the smiles
of a large family of her own, and her only embarrassment
was how to give her children bread. Of love
alone there remained a most plentiful store: but
even of this ingredient it was difficult to say whether,
by rendering each consort an object of constant

<!-- vol 3 page 428 -->

anxiety to the other, it alleviated their sufferings or
increased their solicitude.</p>

<p>To get sight of these worthy people was not so
easy as it might seem. They were proud; they
liked not a stranger to witness their honourable
indigence, and they dreaded the importunate offer
of his superfluity. Even when at last&mdash;through dint
of unabating perseverance&mdash;I obtained leave to visit
them, they showed the greatest ingenuity in eluding
the drift of my visits. With respect to the state
of their finances they were downright hypocrites.
One would have supposed they wanted for nothing.
Fate however ordained me to collect from their
own mouths&mdash;without any thanks to their candour&mdash;the
most practicable mode of relieving their
necessities.</p>

<p>Once, on a Sunday evening, as the husband, at
rest from the week's labour, and with only the
weight of his own little wife hanging on his arm,
had sat listening across the fence which divided our
properties to the narrative of some of my adventures,
and had heard with equal awe and concern
how the soundest parts of my life had been full of
death spots; how pride, passion, love, and hatred&mdash;every
feeling, every lure, and every stimulus&mdash;had in
turns swayed my existence, and with such ill-poised
force, that each during its reign wholly silenced
all the rest, but soon exhausted by indulgence,

<!-- vol 3 page 429 -->

again left its rivals to take a dire revenge; how
by my own ingenuity I had contrived ever to render
useless all the gifts profusely showered upon me;
and how finally my whole life had been a struggle
with a bounteous Providence, which should do and
which undo the most,&mdash;the little woman, at the
conclusion of the story, fetched a deep sigh, and
the husband hereupon giving her a look, she observed
with a blush what a pity it was, that a tale
so eventful and so strange should remain unrecorded:&mdash;Conrad
was so good a penman!</p>

<p>At first I spurned the idea. I had indeed learnt
a little of the world, and at my cost: but of composition
I knew nothing; and though in my flights
of buoyancy and conceit I might frequently have
planned to gratify the world with my motley memoirs,&mdash;though
I had already at various periods
achieved them in part,&mdash;in my days of humiliation
and weakness I recoiled from the idea of disclosing
the flippant narrative begun, and from the arduous
task of ending the dismal tale. That very weakness,
however, which oppressed, at last persuaded
me. I was no longer able to take any exercise, and I
wanted some occupation sufficiently interesting to
prevent a still restless mind from preying upon a
feeble and failing body. Besides&mdash;I own that I
felt a faint wish not to let oblivion wholly blot out
of man's remembrance the name of Anastasius.

<!-- vol 3 page 430 -->

Nor could the scheme encounter great difficulty on
the score of the difference of idiom between me and
my destined secretary: for Conrad, a gentleman
by education as well as by birth, had moreover
acquired in his campaigns a sufficient knowledge of
the French language&mdash;our thus far ordinary medium
of communication&mdash;to write in it correctly
what I should dictate.</p>

<p>If therefore I still only caught at the proposal
slowly; if I still awhile made a show of outward
reluctance, after I had inwardly given my assent,
it was only to obtain on my own terms the assistance
proffered,&mdash;and to extort a right to estimate,
at least in some degree, my obligations to my scribe
as merchants do the services rendered by their correspondents:
a proceeding which was however at
first so haughtily rejected, that I must have despaired
of success, but for the soft whisperings of
pity in the bosom of my new friends. They saw
my frame waste away so fast, that at last they
blushed to let an unseasonable&mdash;I may say an unsympathizing&mdash;delicacy
any longer deprive my few
remaining days of their only solace; and permitted
me to name them in my will. This I eagerly did,
and then committed to their care my person and
my fame. No sooner was the bargain thus struck,
than we sat down. I dictated,&mdash;more or less at a
time, according to my strength and spirits,&mdash;Conrad

<!-- vol 3 page 431 -->

wrote: and this is the fruit. If its flavour should
be deemed to have a strange mixture of the sweet
and the bitter, let it be remembered that sorrow
has its smile, as joy has its tear.</p>

<p>Upon the whole the task has afforded me a
salutary relief from the tedium of my constrained
situation. Only when I have happened, during
the ruminations of my mind, to cast my eyes upon
my honoured scribe&mdash;who sits there smiling to be
thus himself unexpectedly brought forward, while
waiting with uplifted pen a fresh supply of sentences&mdash;and 
have chanced to catch the stolen glances of
affection exchanged between him and his amiable
helpmate, plying her needle by his side, some drops
of bitterness would mix even with this last pleasure.
"Such," thought I, "might have been my own
fate with my Euphrosyne; and such also . . . . . .,"
but already Conrad's incipient frown checks my
digressing any further.</p>

<p>Once or twice, indeed, increasing weakness has
been near putting a stop to my work, in the midst
of its progress. Each time, however, the performance
was, after a short interruption, again duly
resumed;&mdash;and Heaven has at last permitted its
completion.</p>

<p>At thirty-five I here dictate its last page and
sentence. At thirty-five I take leave of all further
earthly concerns: at thirty-five I close&mdash;nevermore

<!-- vol 3 page 432 -->

to re-open it&mdash;the crowded volume of my toilsome
life. In a few weeks, days&mdash;perhaps hours&mdash;will
for ever drop over my person, my actions, and my
errors, the dark curtain of death;&mdash;when nothing
will remain of the once vain and haughty Anastasius,
but an empty name, and a heap of noisome ashes.</p>

<p>O ye who tread their scattered remnants!&mdash;ere
you execrate that name, the theme of so much
obloquy, remember my sufferings: be merciful to
my memory,&mdash;and may Heaven's mercy rest upon
yourselves!</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here ends the author's own narrative: what
follows has been added from the account of the
gentleman he names Conrad.</p>

<p>Anastasius, having completed the last pages of
his memoirs with great effort only, fell, almost
immediately after, into an irremediable languor.
Every day that dawned now threatened&mdash;or rather
promised&mdash;to be his last: for his existence was
become so full of misery, that his end seemed
desirable. Yet could not his sufferings&mdash;intense
as they were&mdash;for a moment subdue his fortitude.
Never was he heard to utter a syllable of impatience
or complaint. Whenever his debility permitted
him to converse, the theme was his adored child.
"Were my heart opened"&mdash;said he one day&mdash;"you

<!-- vol 3 page 433 -->

would find his name inscribed in its core. In
the winning of my Alexis I lost health and strength,
but it was the losing of him which gave me the
death blow. Now that nothing more remains for
me to do but to prepare for my exit, I could have
wished&mdash;had I been a great man, enabled to indulge
all his fancies&mdash;to be earned to the spot where he
lies, there to breathe my last by his beloved side:
but such luxuries an outcast, a homeless wanderer
must not think of. Enough for me, when my hour
is at hand, to have in his gentle spirit an angel on
high, to intercede with his father in Heaven for his
expiring earthly parent."</p>

<p>The third morning after this speech, Conrad,
coming in at an early hour, found not his patient,
as usual, on his pillow. Anastasius had made shift
to creep out of bed, and was kneeling before a chair
on which rested his face. At first he seemed in a
swoon,&mdash;but, discerning the approach of his friend,
he held out his wasted hand to him, and, trying to
raise his head, faintly cried out: "Heaven takes
pity at last. Thanks, O thanks for all your goodness!"&mdash;and
immediately relapsed. After a second
interval of apparent mental absence a second fit of
momentary consciousness followed, when Conrad,
stooping, heard the poor sufferer utter, but in a
voice almost extinct: "O my Alexis, I come!"
and immediately saw his head fall forward again.
Conrad now tried to lift him into bed, in order

<!-- vol 3 page 434 -->

that he might be more at ease. There was no
occasion: Anastasius was no more.</p>

<p>His body, laid out&mdash;by those who owed to him
their restoration to comfort and affluence&mdash;in a
sort of state, was by them committed to its last
mansion with somewhat more solemnity than he
had desired. They inherited half his property:
the other half had been bequeathed to the poor of
the place; and, though stanch Roman Catholics,
its inhabitants&mdash;it is said&mdash;still bless the memory of
the young Greek.</p>
