<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>IT is not without some hesitation and misgiving,
that the editor ventures to withdraw some of the
lighter writings of the late Edmund Quincy from the
pages of half-forgotten magazines, and give them
again to the public, together with the only novel he
ever wrote. In the whirl of the present day, it can
not be expected that many will stop long enough to
read stories of so quiet and unexciting a nature; still
there may be some to whom very accurate pictures
of a way of life long passed away, and tales, all of
which have a certain foundation in fact, may not be
wholly without interest. The history of the octogenary,
Colonel Wyborne, for instance, is in the main
facts a true one; and his nocturnal visit to Boston,
after an absence of fifty years, was an actual occurrence.
Mr. Quincy was always of opinion that his
essay on "Old Houses," published in 1837, might have
suggested to Hawthorne that great magician's wonderful
"Tales of the Province House," published some
time after.</p>

<!-- v1 page iv -->

<p>The best years of Mr. Quincy's life, as many of his
contemporaries will remember, were given to the
antislavery cause; and his writings on that subject,
if published together, would make many volumes,
and might furnish a contribution not without value
to the history of that momentous struggle. The time
for such a republication is not yet come, perhaps never
will come. A few specimens only are given, at the
end of this volume, of what Mr. Quincy wrote on the
subject so near his heart. They were chiefly contributions
to an annual called the "Liberty Bell," edited
by Mrs. Chapman for the antislavery fair which was
held in Boston annually for many years.</p>

<p>I CHRISTENED you in happier days, before<br/>

These gray forebodings on my brow were seen:<br/>

You are still lovely in your new-leaved green;<br/>

The brimming river soothes his grassy shore;<br/>

The bridge is there, the rock with lichens hoar,<br/>

And the same shadows on the water lean,<br/>

Outlasting us. How many graves between<br/>

That day and this! How many shadows more<br/>

Darken my heart, their substance from these eyes<br/>

Hidden forever! So our world is made<br/>

Of life and death commingled; and the sighs<br/>

Outweigh the smiles, in equal balance laid:<br/>

What compensation? None, save that the Allwise<br/>

So schools us to love things that cannot fade.</p>

<p>Thank God, he saw you last in pomp of May,<br/>

Ere any leaf had felt the year's regret:<br/>

Your latest image in his memory set<br/>

<!-- v1 page vi -->

Was fair as when your landscape's peaceful sway<br/>

Charmed dearer eyes with his to make delay<br/>

On Hope's long prospect, as if They forget<br/>

The happy, they, the unspeakable ones, whose debt,<br/>

Like the hawk's shadow, haunts our brightest day.<br/>

Better it is that ye should look so fair,<br/>

Slopes that he loved, and ever-murmuring pines<br/>

That make a music out of silent air,<br/>

And bloom-heaped orchard-trees in prosperous lines:<br/>

In you the heart some sweeter hints divines,<br/>

And wiser, than in winter's dull despair.</p>

<p>Old friend, farewell! Your kindly door again<br/>

I enter; but the master's hand in mine<br/>

No more clasps welcome, and the temperate wine<br/>

That cheered our long night other lips must stain.<br/>

All is unchanged; but I expect in vain<br/>

The face alert, the manners free and fine,<br/>

The seventy years borne lightly as the pine<br/>

Wears its first down of snow in green disdain.<br/>

Much did he, and much well; yet most of all<br/>

I prized his skill in leisure and the ease<br/>

Of a life flowing full without a plan;<br/>

For most are idly busy; him I call<br/>

Thrice fortunate who knew himself to please,<br/>

Learned in those arts that make a gentleman.</p>

<p>Nor deem he lived unto himself alone;<br/>

His was the public spirit of his sire,<br/>

And in those eyes, soft with domestic fire,<br/>

A quenchless light of fiercer temper shone<br/>

What time about the world our shame was blown<br/>

<!-- v1 page vii -->

On every wind; his soul would not conspire<br/>

With selfish men to soothe the mob's desire,<br/>

Veiling with garlands Moloch's bloody stone;<br/>

The high-bred instincts of a better day<br/>

Ruled in his blood, when to be citizen<br/>

Rang Roman yet, and a Free People's sway<br/>

Was not the exchequer of impoverished men,<br/>

Nor statesmanship with loaded votes to play,<br/>

Nor public office a tramp's boozing ken.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>

<p>TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION OF WENSLEY.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>As the last sheets of this work were passing
through the press, my friend in Boston, who is kind
enough to read the proofs for me, was asked by
the competent authorities of the printing-office for
the preface. Now, it had never occurred to me to
write a preface; and I do not believe I should ever
have thought of it had it not been for this official
reminder. But, when I came to think the matter
over, it seemed to me quite likely that the "gentle
readers, and still gentler purchasers," (may their
name be Legion!) might possibly marvel within
themselves why I should have thought it worth my
while and theirs to confide to them the passages of
my life herein recorded. So, perhaps, as it has
been put into my head, I may as well tell just how it all
came to pass.</p>

<p>I am sure, if anybody wonders at finding himself
(or herself) the depositary of personal confidences on
my part, I am much more astonished to find myself

<!-- v1 page x -->

making them. It fell out on this wise. In the early
part of August, 1852, while the monthly bearing the
superscription of Mr. Putnam, 10 Park Place, New
York, was as yet only in supposition, a gentleman
now prominently connected with the management of
that excellent periodical chanced to be my guest for
a while. An accident which befell him while on a
pedestrian tour among the Appalachians, the particulars
of which are immaterial to my present purpose,
though sufficiently interesting in themselves, obliged
him to remain for some time under my roof. The
many who enjoy his acquaintanceship will think it
a very natural consequence of this adventure that he
should have made me a friend; while the few who
possess mine will esteem it a very odd one that he
should have made me an author. But so it was.</p>

<p>And thus it was. Confiding to me the project
of the intended magazine, he kindly invited me to contribute
something for its pages. Now, I had always
wished to leave behind me some sketch, however
imperfect, in the lack of a more skilful limner, of
my revered and beloved friend Mr. Bulkley; and here
seemed to be the occasion and the repository offered
ready to my hand. So in due time I wrote, and forwarded
to New York, the substance of what the reader
will find in the first two chapters of the book before
him; that is, if he have not already read the book on
the supposition that he had laid hold of a novel, (a

<!-- v1 page xi -->

species of literature which I have no wish, as there is
certainly no occasion, to encourage), and now turned
back to the preface last of all, as Sir Walter Scott
tells us is the way with that class of students, to find
out what the author would be at.</p>

<p>The kindness with which this outline was welcomed,
and the friendly encouragement I received to
fill it up, induced me to enlarge my canvas, and to
paint in the other figures that seemed likely to illustrate
my main design. It was throughout my purpose
to have Mr. Bulkley the central figure of the group,
and to make him the chief object of observation and
interest. I say thus much to excuse myself to those
readers who object to the appearance of egotism, which
is inseparable from the autobiographic form which
my narrative naturally assumed. I say <i>naturally</i>,
because it seems to me more simple to recount any
passages in which one took a part one's self in the
first person rather than in the third; though, to be
sure, there are illustrious examples to the contrary&mdash;as
Julius C&aelig;sar of Rome, and Major-General Heath
of Massachusetts, in their respective Commentaries.
The first of these military authors says, "C&aelig;sar
did so and so;" and the other, "This being the
opinion of our general, he did this and that." But,
as I was never suspected of being a hero, I prefer
the more plain and straightforward form of speech,
which, if it savor more of vanity (which I doubt) than

<!-- v1 page xii -->

the other, at least smacks less of affectation, which
is worse yet.</p>

<p>Thus it was that my narration grew up to its
present bulk, and extended itself through all the
numbers of a whole volume of Putnam, instead of
occupying a modest corner of one. After it had run
its race in that arena, I supposed that there was an
end of the whole thing; when, one day a while ago,
I received a letter from the eminent publishers,
Messrs. TICKNOR AND FIELDS, of Boston, proposing to
print it in book form. At first I could account for
the proposition only on the hypothesis that that
respectable firm had been seized with a sudden
paroxysm of insanity&mdash;a theory rendered the more
probable by the accounts the Boston newspapers were
then giving of the untimely raging of the dogstar in
those latitudes, driving great numbers even of the
canine race out of their wits. But finding, on inquiry,
that no commission of lunacy had as yet been issued
against those worthy gentlemen, I was prevailed upon
to yield my opinion to theirs, and to consent to their
proposal, the rather that it included inducements
which no true-born, well-brought-up, intelligent
American citizen could find it in his heart to resist.</p>

<p>This is the way by which Wensley has come into
the hands of the reader in its present shape. I can
hardly help laughing to see myself in such relations
with the public after so many years of absolute

<!-- v1 page xiii -->

retirement. But then, to be sure, it is very likely
that the critics, should they get hold of me, will make
me laugh the other side of my mouth. If my publishers
were indeed in the rabid condition above
suggested, when they proposed giving it this form
and pressure, I must hope, for their sake merely, that
they may succeed in <i>biting</i> uncounted multitudes
throughout the country. But if they should not, and
they should find that they have made a loss by the
operation, the responsibility as well as the loss will
be theirs alone. I never asked them to undertake it.
But should the public, which I acknowledge as the
tribunal of the last appeal, in passing upon my part
of the matter before them, pronounce judgment
against it, I shall bow reverently to the decree; and
all that I shall have to say in mitigation of sentence,
and extenuation of my fault, will be expressed in the
formulas of the ancient pleas of the nursery and the
school room: "I did not mean to do it; I am sorry
for it; and I will never do so again."</p>

<h2>WENSLEY:</h2>

<p>A STORY WITHOUT A MORAL.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">HOW I CAME TO GO TO WENSLEY.</p>

</div>

<p>I BELIEVE I have a natural affinity&mdash;it may be
only an elective one&mdash;for odd people. At any
rate, allowing for my limited opportunities, it has been
my hap to fall in with my share of them during the
time past of my pilgrimage. And I began betimes
too. I dare say not many of my readers ever heard
of the Rev. Mr. Adrian Bulkley of Wensley, in
Massachusetts; and yet I will make bold to assure
them that they have not had many acquaintances
better worth knowing than he; or, if they have,
their luck has been more than mine. It is a thousand
pities that he had not fallen in the way of
Charles Lamb or De Quincey. They, or Hawthorne,
would have delighted in making him immortal. But
for the lack of a sacred bard he must needs be forgotten,
like the heroes that lived before Agamemnon,

<!-- v1 page 4 -->

and be as if he had never been. Possibly his name
may yet be one of the household words of the little
inland town over which he predominated for so many
years; and perhaps the genial eccentricities of his life
and speech may still make the staple of a winter's
tale round a farmer's fireside there. But, beyond
these narrow bounds and the not much wider sphere
of his clerical exchanges, he was but little known
while he lived; and even within them his memory
must, by the natural laws of decay, be gradually
mouldering away, along with his dust in the Minister's
Tomb, out of men's minds. So that it will
not be many years before his name will survive
only in the homely annals of the parish records,
on the tablet lately erected by the Wensley Sewing
Circle to the deceased ministers of the town, and
in the triennial catalogue of Harvard College.</p>

<p>I well remember my first sight of him; and well
I may; for it was connected with a little incident in
my life such as usually makes a deep impression on
any ingenuous youth whom it befalls. Not to mince
the matter, the government of the college charged
with my education were misled by a train of untoward
circumstances to the conclusion that a residence
of some months in a rural district, remote from the
temptations incident to academic life, would be at
once beneficial to me, and of good example, by way
of warning, to the rest of the university. I need
hardly say to any one who knew me at that time, or
who enjoys that advantage now, that they were

<!-- v1 page 5 -->

entirely mistaken, and rested their conclusions upon
very erroneous premises. The facts were these:
there was at that time a sodality, or voluntary association
of youth for mutual improvement, the object
of which was to combine abstract with practical science.
Their purpose was to imitate, at a humble distance,
the example of the divine Socrates, and to call
philosophy down from heaven to minister to the necessities
of man. They delighted in nicely observing
the effects of fire, for instance, on certain animal
and vegetable substances. They curiously watched
the chemical changes resulting from the mixture of
divers liquids one with another. And they speculated
profoundly on the laws of pneumatics, whereby,
through the agency of fire at the one end and of a gentle
suction at the other, a desiccated vegetable convolution
could be returned to its original elements of
air and earth in the form of smoke and ashes&mdash;<i>pulvis
et umbra</i>, as Horace would have said touching
it, had he not died before the sight.</p>

<p>This harmless, not to say praiseworthy, fraternity
appropriately denominated themselves "the Deipnosophoi,"
or supper philosophers,&mdash;a term which very
aptly described the practical nature of their scientific
pursuits. It did sometimes happen to them, as it
hath to the ardent followers of science in all times,
that they pursued their investigations a little too far,
and that occasionally the supper was rather too much
for the philosophy. It was the gloss of the rulers of
the university, that the night which was the immediate

<!-- v1 page 6 -->

cause of my introduction to Mr. Bulkley was
one of these exceptional occasions. I neither admit
nor deny the imputation. It was affirmed on behalf
of the prosecution that songs of a lively character,
interspersed with laughter of a vociferous nature and
an occasional shout of triumph, disturbed the stillness
of the night. It did also happen that the windows
of an unpopular tutor (since a very eminent literary
and public man) were broken in a most emphatic
and unqualified manner that particular night. But
I defy the world to the proof that any of our party
had anything to do with that. But suppose both
these charges could have been substantiated, I appeal
to every impartial and well-regulated mind whether
any inference could be drawn from them to the disadvantage
of young votaries of science, who could
not refrain from seizing a favorable moment for
testing the principles of acoustics, or were unable to
resist an eminently tempting opportunity to reduce
to practice the laws governing projectiles. These liberal
views, unfortunately, did not inspire the proctors
when they gave hot chase to our party, who, resorting
to the laws regulating muscular locomotion with
great energy, all made their escape with the exception
of my unlucky self. But I, after practically
experiencing the law of the resistance of matter by
striking my foot against a stone, exemplified that of
gravitation by measuring my length on my mother
earth.</p>

<p>Of course there was no use of resistance or disguise

<!-- v1 page 7 -->

when the enemy had me at such a deadly advantage.
Wellington, Napoleon, General Taylor himself, would
have surrendered under such circumstances. I was
seized and identified, and then ordered to go to my
rooms. This was quite superfluous, as I had no intention
of going anywhere else. So I went thither, cursing
my ill luck, and having a particularly ill opinion
of supper-eating combined with philosophy. Nor did
this unfortunate conjunction rise in my estimation
when I was summoned before the college government
in full conclave the next morning to answer for the
deeds done the night before. Honest old souls! Not
one of them left! I hated some of them then, but I
think tenderly and reverently of them all now. Of
course I admitted what could not be denied, but resolutely
refused to give any information that should
implicate any one else. So I was thought to have
got off very easily when the president sent for me soon
after and read to me my credentials, (then
popularly known as my <i>walking ticket</i>), stating that
the government, in consideration of Osborne's having
assisted at a festive entertainment on such a night,
sentenced him to be suspended for nine months, to
pass the same under the charge of the Rev. Adrian
Bulkley of Wensley.</p>

<p>After a little advice, given in the kindly and
friendly tone which has given him a place in the
hearts of all his academic sons, the president dismissed
me with "a merry twinkle in his eye," as if
he did not regard me as a sinner above all others,

<!-- v1 page 8 -->

enjoining it upon me to leave town within an hour.
Having expected this, and having escaped much better
than I had feared, a chum of mine drove me to
Boston as fast as Read's best horse could carry us.
Here I reported my misfortune to my guardian,
(having been an orphan since infancy); and after receiving,
like Don Juan, "a lecture and some money,"
I took my place on the top of the stage-coach which
passed through Wensley on its way to Haverford,
and found myself, about five o'clock on a fine afternoon
in June, whirling up to the door of Grimes's
tavern, well renowned in all the region round about
for flip, the loggerhead whereof never grew cold.</p>

<p>Old Grimes&mdash;I beg his pardon, I mean Major
Grimes&mdash;squinted a welcome to me out of his one
eye, while his copper nose glowed with anticipated
hospitality as he assisted me to descend from my
elevation. But his hopes of immediate advantage
from my advent were dampened by my inquiring, as
soon as I had complied with the custom of the time,
and done my best to qualify the coachman for breaking
the necks of the travellers I left behind me, by a
stiff glass of toddy,&mdash;by my inquiring, I say, for the
house of the Rev. Mr. Bulkley.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bulkley!" repeated the Major, wiping his
toddy stick as he spoke, and laying it reverently aside
for the next occasion, sure soon to recur; "you are
a relation of his, perhaps, sir?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, that I know of," was my curt
response.</p>

<!-- v1 page 9 -->

<p>"Ah, only an acquaintance, then?" persisted the
gallant toddy mixer.</p>

<p>"Never saw him in my life," said I.</p>

<p>"Only know him by reputation?" suggested the
Major.</p>

<p>"Never heard of his existence till this morning,"
I returned, rather snappishly; "but for all that I
wish to see him, and shall be obliged to you if you
will tell me where he lives."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," drawled out mine host, cocking
his eye afresh at me with an indescribably knowing
leer, which was also indescribably provoking, "now
I understand it all. When did you leave Cambridge,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Cambridge be d&mdash;&mdash;d!" said I in my haste, (I
do not justify this summary disposition of that ancient
seat of learning, but historical accuracy compels
me to record that this was the precise formula I made
use of): "is it any business of yours, I should like to
know, where I came from? What I want of you is
to know where I'm to go."</p>

<p>"Not the least business of mine in the world,"
responded my interrogator with the most quiet equanimity,
still regarding me out of the corner of his eye
with an expression in which fun and toddy seemed
to be mixed, half and half; "but I have directed
several young gentlemen to Priest Bulkley's in my
time, though it is a good while since the last one.
I know how they look, sir: there's no mistaking 'em."
And he chuckled till I felt inclined to close up the one

<!-- v1 page 10 -->

organ he had left for making such observations on
the rising generation under difficulties. But, restraining
my wrath, I contented myself with saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should like to know what the devil you have
to do with my affairs, sir. If you can answer my
question without any more impertinence, answer it;
if not, I will try and find my way by myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir," replied the Yankee
Boniface; "I meant no offence. I know that young
gentlemen will get into scrapes, sir; though it seems
to me that the beauty of a scholar is to keep out of
the scrapes, sir. Not a bad scrape, I hope, sir?"</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" I bounced out in a towering
passion, and at the same time bounced out of the
tavern door to find my own way. But I soon heard
the inquiring Major hobbling after me; for he was
damaged in one leg as well as in his visual orb.</p>

<p>"I say, sir," he called out after me,&mdash;"I say, sir,
don't be mad with a fellow. I meant no harm. Why,
Judge Waldo, and Parson Tisdale, and General Shaw,
and half a dozen others I could tell you of, have been
sent to the old priest since I have lived here, just as
you are now, and nobody thinks any the worse of 'em
for it. Halloo, sir!" he exclaimed, seeing me only
hurry on the faster to get out of the reach of the
catalogue of my illustrious predecessors,&mdash;"halloo,
sir! You ain't going the right way! You'll bring up
at old Dr. Fitch's, in Southfield, instead of Priest
Bulkley's, the way you're going. But perhaps he'd
do just as well."</p>

<!-- v1 page 11 -->

<p>This brought me up standing; and I soon put my
course about, and returned to the tavern-door, the
Major talking all the while without stopping to draw
breath or even to spit. When at the door, summoning
all the dignity of incensed nineteen into my
face, I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I will thank you to put me in my
way without any more words."</p>

<p>"Can't be done without 'em, sir," replied my imperturbable
tormentor; "must use 'em, unless I go
along with you. Perhaps I had better."</p>

<p>"Tell me the way, if you can, and be hanged to
you!" I exclaimed in a rage. "I want none of
your company. I've had enough of it already."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," replied the placable man of
war with perfect good-humor; "you will just keep straight
on through the village till you come to the meeting-house;
and the priest's house is the third beyond it,
on your left hand, just at the head of the road."</p>

<p>"And why could you not have told me this an
hour ago?" said I, setting off at a round pace, the
Major sending his winged words after me as long as
I was within hearing, and I dare say a good while
longer.</p>

<p>"You'll find the parson at home, sir. I saw him
ride by just before you came; and if his old horse
hasn't fell to pieces, he's to home by this time. I'll
take good care of your trunk, sir. The priest'll send
black Jasp after it for you. Hope you'll give me a
call, sir. Best of wine and spirits. No such flip in

<!-- v1 page 12 -->

the country, sir, nor punch, neither. Priest Bulkley
tries to keep his scholars away from me; but it's of
no use, sir. They will come. And so will you, I
hope, sir," etc.</p>

<p>And when I turned my head to transfix the loquacious
sinner with a Parthian look of indignant contempt,
I saw him laughing with all his might as he
halted back to his dominions. I felt very much as
if I should have liked to kill him just then; but
we became very good friends before long. Perhaps there
was more danger of his killing me.</p>

<p>So I passed on through the main street of the
village, which, indeed, was no street at all, but a country
road sprinkled with farm-houses, none of which
seemed to have been built since the old French war,
with fine old elms and buttonwood-trees in front of
most of them. Near the bridge which spanned the
pretty little Quasheen, which ran through the town,
was the grocer's shop, which also contained the post-office,
from which favorite retreat and the bench in
front of it stared forth whatever loungers the village
could boast; but in sooth they were not many, and
were mostly made so by the potent spirits of which
Major Grimes had boasted himself. But in those
days a certain allowance of topers was thought as
necessary a result of the institutions of New England,
in every town, as a due proportion of militia officers
or of church-members.</p>

<p>Just over the bridge on the other side of the way,
"under a spreading chestnut-tree," stood the village

<!-- v1 page 13 -->

smithy, which was about the only other place that
showed signs of animation, with its glowing forge,
flying sparks, regular sharp strokes that made the
anvil quiver, and with the farmers waiting with their
horses and wagons for their turn of the Cyclopean
art. Still, so rare was the sight of a stranger that
for a moment even the anvil had rest, and the weary
lungs of the bellows ceased to fan, like the breath of
a mischief-maker, fires that were hot enough before
into tenfold fury, while they all took a good look at
me, and then, no doubt, discussed all the possibilities
of my personal identity and antecedents, substantially
very much as such phenomena are treated in the
bow-windows of English clubs or the smoking-rooms
of American hotels.</p>

<p>I soon came to the meeting-house, leaving which
on my left hand, I approached, much faster than I
liked, my destination. The parsonage was full in
sight of the meeting house; but though, as the Major
had informed me, there were but two houses between
them, it was a good third of a mile to it. The road
taking a bend just there, the ministers had apparently
taken it up as a good raking position, commanding
the church and the green about it, and thus serving
as a sort of outpost or tower of observation, appurtenant
to the walls of their Zion. I confess that I did
not regard the edifice before me with any violent
emotions of pleasure. To be delivered up for nine
mortal months to the tender mercies of a Calvinistic
minister of the very straitest sect (for such I had ascertained

<!-- v1 page 14 -->

him to be) seemed rather a severe retribution
for one night of supping philosophy. But it is
in vain to contend with inexorable fate. I strode on,
resolving to face mine with the best grace I could.
But, as often happens, I found the frown which I
had dreaded turn into a most attractive smile. For
this acquaintance, thus forced upon me and thus unpromising
in anticipation, proved one of the chiefest
pleasures of my youth and early manhood, and ended
in a friendship which lasted as long as his life, and
which certainly was not buried with him. But I
am now close upon him, and will introduce him to
the reader as soon as I have made his acquaintance
myself. A new chapter, however, is the least compliment
I can pay to either party.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE MINISTER AND HIS MAN.</p>

</div>

<p>THE parsonage was merely a plain, unpainted
farm-house, some hundred and fifty years old,
with its roof sloping to the ground behind, and overgrown
with moss. The grass grew green up to the broad
doorstone, which was divided from the high road by
no fence. The house was overshadowed by a magnificent
elm, which had taken root apparently before
Columbus had begun to dream of a western passage
to the India of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville.
On a rough seat which ran round this tree sat a
gentleman, who, I knew at the first glance, must be
my fate for nine months at least. As I approached
near enough to give him assurance that my visit was
meant for him, he laid aside the pipe with which he
was solacing himself and rose to receive me. He
advanced, erect and a little formal, but with an air
of one that had seen the world, for which I was not
prepared, as I knew nothing of his history. His
dress, I am bound to say, bore no marks of inordinate
care, and possibly might have been the better for
a judicious application of needle and thread in
some of its departments. But, for all that, he had
eminently the look of a gentleman of the old school.

<!-- v1 page 16 -->

The hat which he raised when I approached was, I
regret to say, one of the profane round abominations
which came in with the French revolution, and
which still deform the heads of the nineteenth century.
And it was his own white hair (for he was
then near seventy) that it covered.</p>

<p>His cocked hat, not long relinquished, yet hung
behind the study-door; and his wig, which had anticipated
his hat by some years in its flight from
before the innovating spirit of the age, still stood in
its box on the bookcase to your right as you faced
the fireplace. His knee-breeches, I rejoice to say, he
lived in to the last&mdash;and for that matter died in too.
Later in our acquaintance, when, in spite of the difference
in our ages,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"We talked with open heart and tongue,<br/>

Affectionate and true,<br/>

A pair of friends,"&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley would sometimes assume, for my edification,
these ancient symbols of clerical dignity, and,
with his gold-headed cane in his hand, step as it were
out of the middle of the last century, every inch a
minister of a time when the New England clergy
were, indeed, what M. Kossuth wished the United
States to become&mdash;"a power on earth."</p>

<p>Upon my introducing myself, and presenting the
letters introductory with which my Alma Mater had
favored me, he courteously welcomed me to Wensley,
and then, glancing at the document, looked at me,
with a comic expression out of the corner of his eye,

<!-- v1 page 17 -->

over his spectacles, which he had donned for the
nonce, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A festive entertainment, eh? That's what they
call 'em now, is it? Bad things, festive entertainments,
Mr. Osborne."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" I interpolated, "it was quite a mistake;
a very innocent affair, I assure you."</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt," responded he. "The college
government is subject to error, like all human bodies;
and it is rather remarkable that they have happened
to be mistaken in the case of every young gentleman
that they have ever sent to me. Quite a Massacre of
the Innocents, I do assure you!" and he laughed so
cordially and good naturedly that I could not help
joining him.</p>

<p>"For all that, sir," I replied, "mine was a very
harmless business, as I believe you will allow when
I tell you the particulars; if, indeed, you consent to
receive me."</p>

<p>"It is a long time," he said, "since I have afforded
a city of refuge to the ill-used sons of Mother Harvard,&mdash;if
she may not be rather entitled to be called step-mother,
an <i>injusta noverca</i>, you know, in such cases,&mdash;and
I had about made up my mind to shut up my
sanctuary for good. But may I ask if you are the son
of the late Hon. Joseph Osborne, of Boston?"</p>

<p>"I have the honor to be Mr. Osborne's son," I answered;
"though he died before my remembrance."</p>

<p>"Of course he must have," Mr. Bulkley continued;
"but you have a trick of his face that reminds me of

<!-- v1 page 18 -->

him. As the country people say in these parts, you
<i>favor</i> him decidedly."</p>

<p>"You knew my father, then, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Knew him? Why, my dear sir, he was my very
old and very good friend. He was a year before me
in college; but, for all that, we were intimates of the
closest description. Ten thousand pipes have we
smoked together;" and he sighed as his mind reverted
to those fleeting joys. "But our friendship did not
end in smoke, if it began in it," he continued, with a
melancholy kind of smile: "it lasted until he died,&mdash;too
soon for his friends and his country, though he had
served both long and well."</p>

<p>My heart warmed to the old man at hearing him
thus speak of my father, for whose memory I cherished
the strongest admiration and reverence; and I began
to feel a wish growing within me that he might accept
me as an abiding guest during my term of exile. So
I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope, then, sir, you will not refuse to receive
my father's son under your roof. It would be a great
satisfaction to me to live under the care of a friend
of his; and I will endeavor to give you as little trouble
as possible."</p>

<p>"It is not the trouble I am thinking of, Mr. Osborne,"
he replied; "but I doubt whether I can make
you comfortable in my strange bachelor way of living.
It suits me; but I am afraid that it may not suit a
young gentleman like you."</p>

<p>I was proceeding to assure him that he need give

<!-- v1 page 19 -->

himself no uneasiness on that score, when he interrupted
me with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you will stay with me to-night at least,
and to-morrow we will decide as to the rest of the
time. Here, Jasper! Jasper!" he called out, clapping
his hands as the Orientals do for lack of bells.</p>

<p>And at the word Jasper appeared, issuing from the
front-door. He was black as ebony, and his blackness
was set off by the perfect whiteness of his hair,
which had scarcely a perceptible wave in it, and by
the glitter of his teeth. He was a remarkably handsome
old man for all his complexion. His features
were more Caucasian than African as usually seen;
his nose straight, though a little thicker than the
Apollo's; and his lips not larger than those of multitudes
of men calling themselves white. He evidently
came of a comelier race, such as travellers assure us
exists in the interior of Africa, than that furnished by
the Guinea coast, the Southern Hive from which have
swarmed the involuntary emigrations of the negro
race. He stood two or three inches over six feet in
his stockings, and was not at all bent by his threescore
and ten years. He stood firm and erect, awaiting his
orders.</p>

<p>"Jasper," said Mr. Bulkley, "you remember Mr.
Osborne, who used to come here twenty years ago?"</p>

<p>"Lawyer Osborne, of Boston," answered Jasper, in
a tone of deliberate recollection, "who got off Pomp
Jaffrey from being hanged in the year three?" Mr.
Bulkley nodded. "Yes, sir, I remember him."</p>

<!-- v1 page 20 -->

<p>"This young gentleman," proceeded his master,
indicating me with the stem of his pipe, which he
had resumed, "is his son, and will spend the night
here."</p>

<p>"Proud to see you here, sir," replied Jasper, still
remaining perfectly erect, but bringing up his hand
to the military salute in the most respectful manner.</p>

<p>"Take your wheelbarrow, Jasper, after tea, and
go and fetch Mr. Osborne's trunk from Grimes's.&mdash;You
left it there, I suppose?" turning to me.</p>

<p>I assented, of course; and Jasper bent his whole
body a few degrees in token that he understood his
orders. He then faced to the right about and
marched back to the parsonage. We followed him
almost immediately, and found him rearranging the
tea-table to meet the rare emergency of company.
This was laid in the study, the room on the left as
you entered the front-door, and the only room occupied
by the minister by day, (he slept in the one opposite),
and which was drawing-room and dining-room
as well. It deserved, indeed, to be called the library;
for its walls were covered with a collection of books
which would be thought large for a private one even
at this day of larger things. They were, like their
master, of no very modern date or dress, but of sterling
and various merit&mdash;good substantial friends of
all ages and of many climes. Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
French, and Italian were there good store, and English
down to the end of the last century. There he
stopped; for, as he said, of buying as well as of making

<!-- v1 page 21 -->

books there was no end. I remember he had
never heard of Lord Byron until I introduced him
to his acquaintance. And he would not like him
then, in spite of my boyish enthusiasm for the
Harolds, Manfreds, Laras, Conrads, and other <i>aliases</i>
under which it was his lordship's pleasure to disguise
himself. But down to his own time he was thoroughly
well read, and a discriminating and entertaining
critic, though something odd in his taste as it
was then accounted oddity. I recollect he first
brought me acquainted with old Burton, and with
Ben Jonson, and the earlier dramatists.</p>

<p>Jasper soon furnished forth an ample New England
tea, to which I was quite prepared to do an
ample justice. But while I am discussing in imagination
the excellent johnny-cake and rye-and-Indian
bread, and while Jasper waits upon us with the
gravity and decorum of the butler of a duke, let me
pause, and dwell for a moment on the images of the
two men, inseparable to my mind's eye as it glances
back at those happy days. Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza, Tom Jones and Partridge, Peregrine Pickle
and Pipes, Roderick Random and Strap, Uncle Toby
and Trim are not more one and indivisible in the
general mind of English readers than are (with all
reverence be it spoken) the Rev. Mr. Adrian Bulkley,
and Jasper, his man-of-all-work, in mine.  Maid-of-all-work
he might also be denominated; for he
was both maid and man to the worthy minister,
and performed all feminine as well as virile offices

<!-- v1 page 22 -->

in the household and domain of his master. I do
not know whether Jasper's cooking and sweeping
and bed-making would have come up to the
highest ideal of the more fanatical of the sect
of the housekeepers. I am not quite sure whether
I myself should relish their results now as I did
thirty odd years ago, in the undiscriminating freshness
of nineteen. But they answered Mr. Bulkley's
purposes; and, such being the case, I shall not stir
the question of details, conceiving that they are
none of the reader's business.</p>

<p>The fairer portion of my readers would have divined
by this time, even if I had not inadvertently let
the fact slip a few paragraphs ago, that Mr. Bulkley
was a bachelor. But let them not condemn him
too summarily or too severely for this blemish in his
character; for I believe there was an excuse for it
the validity of which they should admit, though I
could never get at the precise facts, as it was a
subject to which he would bear no allusion. It
is enough to say that, according to the unbroken
tradition of Wensley, he had an early and unhappy
passion for the beautiful Miss Julia Mansfield, who
was the toast of every mess table during the siege
of Boston. It was the old story of Crabbe's Patron
over again, as far as I could gather; only that Mr.
Bulkley was not so easily killed as poor poet John.
He came into Mr. Mansfield's family as tutor to his
youngest son, Thomas, (afterwards the Colonel Mansfield
who was killed by a shell, in his tent, before

<!-- v1 page 23 -->

Badajos) soon after leaving college; and, finding
there the most lovely young woman in the province,&mdash;gay,
thoughtless, coquettish, and seventeen,&mdash;is
it any wonder that he found his fate there too?
He did not know that she was vain, coldhearted, and
selfish (perhaps he never knew it) until the mischief
was done.</p>

<p>It was done, however; and poor Bulkley had taken
leave forever of the unkind Julia and of his dream
of happiness, and was finding what consolation he
might in the pursuit of divinity (a very different
mistress) before the war broke out. At the evacuation,
Miss Julia accompanied her father (who, all
the world knows, was one of Governor Hutchinson's
mandamus councillors) into exile; and she married,
not long afterwards, Colonel Ferguson, the receiver-general
of Jamaica. It was not a well-assorted marriage,
and its history is not one that I care to
record. The lovers of Old-World scandals can mouse
out the details from the contemporary chronicles of
such matters for themselves, as I did, if they must
know them. But the old Wensley people used to
say that the minister was plunged into a deeper
dejection by the news, in the year eighty-seven, of
the duel in which her husband shot Sir James Carlton
on her account, near Spanishtown, than even at
that of her death, which arrived soon afterwards.
He seemed to feel it as a personal dishonor. It
was a cruel iconoclasm,&mdash;that shot, which broke in
pieces the idol he had privily worshipped in the

<!-- v1 page 24 -->

secret places of his heart for so many melancholy
years.</p>

<p>After Jasper had cleared away the tea-things, Mr.
Bulkley and I sat by the window and entered into a
long conversation, which I have not time to record,
though I remember a great deal of it. We began
with the college and the latest news therefrom, including,
of course, my own <i>escapade</i>, which my new
Mentor did not seem to look upon as a crime of the
blackest dye. He laughed merrily at the details I
gave him of my adventure, which I did, unconsciously,
with as much freedom as if I were talking with one
of my own contemporaries. There was that about
this gentleman which put one at perfect ease with him
on the first acquaintance; and there was nothing in his
tone or manner which asserted his claims as a superior
by virtue of age and experience. Of course, as in duty
bound, he stood by the college government as touching
the necessity of inflicting the discipline they did,
having had the misfortune to make the unlucky discovery.
But he evidently rather <i>cottoned</i> (to use a
Fanny Kembleism) to the Deipnosophoi; and would
have thought it good luck, and no great harm, if they
had all escaped with a whole skin, even if some of
them should have done it with a <i>full</i> one. The temperance
movement had not, at that time, begun to
play the mischief with the old drinking usages of
New England; and a slight convivial exuberance
occasionally was looked upon as no very heinous offence
even by the graver classes of society.</p>

<!-- v1 page 25 -->

<p>Mr. Bulkley belonged to a grave class of society,
certainly; but he was no very grave member of it
when he unbent himself from the serious business of
his profession. A merrier man "within the limit of
becoming mirth," one does not often talk withal in
one's journey through this working-day world. I
think he had the finest voice for a story (and, like
most of his cloth at that time, he abounded in them)
that I ever heard. It was as good fun as seeing
Mathews to hear him tell one. And then his laugh!
He did, indeed, "laugh the heart's laugh," before which
no blue devils, however resolute, could hold their
ground. From this latest piece of college history he
made a transition to his own times, and told many
piquant anecdotes concerning the customs of those
times and the adventures of men afterwards famous.
The hardest sort of drinking seemed to have been
quite the general rule of his day; and his stories
showed that some advances had been made in refinement,
at least, between his time and mine. The
Deipnosophoi, I am happy to say, could furnish no
parallels to some of the instances he related of the
potatory achievements of our grandfathers. I had
begun a paragraph to tell of some of them; but, on
the whole, I believe I will not "draw their frailties
from their dread abode." Let one brief specimen, by
no means one of the best or the most characteristic,
suffice.</p>

<p>"I remember poor Tom Frost," said he, "whom
you must have heard of. He turned democrat; and

<!-- v1 page 26 -->

Jefferson sent him consul to Tripoli, where he died
of the plague." I intimated that I had heard him
mentioned, and Mr. Bulkley continued, "I remember,
one Commencement Day, he fell into the company
of a set of jolly blades,&mdash;being, in general, a
very steady-going fellow,&mdash;and got most undeniably
and unequivocally drunk. It was with some difficulty
that he was put to bed; but at last he was fairly
between the sheets, and we thought he was disposed
of for the night. But we had not been gone long,
when we heard a heavy sound in his chamber, and,
hastening thither, found that he had fallen out of bed.
After replacing him, one of his friends remonstrated
pretty sharply with him for giving us this new trouble.
'Why, I'll tell you how it was, fellows,' said poor
Tom, with drunken gravity; 'it was not my fault. I
held on to the cursed bed as long as it could be done.
For, as soon as you had gone out, it began to whirl
round one way, and then it spun round the other; and
then the head of the bed was lifted up to the ceiling,
and then the foot; and then it rocked from one side
to the other like a raving-distracted cradle. And I
held on to it like a good fellow. It couldn't shake me
out, let it do its worst; but when the d&mdash;&mdash;d thing
turned upside down the devil himself could hold on
no longer, and no more could I!' " And the minister
laughed his musical laugh till all rang again.</p>

<p>"Your friend," said I, "certainly fulfilled the conditions
laid down by an English Cantab in Blackwood
lately, who says that he thinks it most unfair and

<!-- v1 page 27 -->

ungenerous to call a man drunk as long as he can
hold on by the sheets. But if he will persist in
tumbling out of bed as fast as you put him into it,
then the most candid must admit that it is no abuse
of language or of charity to pronounce him drunk."</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley laughed, and the conversation took a
new departure, and ranged far and wide over books,
and politics, and Old-World family histories, until the
late summer evening closed in about us. After it
grew dark, Jasper entered, holding one of his own
dips in his hand, with which he made a sort of military
salute to me, saying, "Your trunk is in your
chamber, sir;" and then, placing his candle on a stand
near the opposite window (for the study filled the
entire breadth of the house, having windows on the
two sides), and taking a large folio from a lower shelf,
put on his heavy iron-bound spectacles and set himself
diligently to read it. It was evident, from the
perfect simplicity with which it was done, that it was
nothing out of the common course of events; but it
took all my scanty stock of good breeding to conceal
the astonishment I felt at such a phenomenon. Had
the minister's old horse (which, like Yorick's, was
"full brother to Rozinante, as far as similitude congenial
could make him") walked in from the stable
and squatted himself on his haunches, like a Houyhnhm,
beside me, I could not have been more taken
aback. I fully assented to the general reputation
which pronounced Parson Bulkley a very odd man.</p>

<!-- v1 page 28 -->

<p>Poor Jasper read, with the help of his forefinger
and with a laborious murmur of the lips, like one
whose reading had not "come by nature," but by
hard work, after he was grown up; and I had a
suspicion that this lecture was rather for my edification
than for his own, though, when I discovered afterwards
that it was a volume of "Hakluyt's Voyages"
he was encountering, I was somewhat shaken in it.
There was a comical expression in Mr. Bulkley's eye,
too, which showed that he was not without the same
surmise. We talked on without regarding Jasper's
presence, until nine o'clock, when the minister read
a chapter in the Bible, and prayed, according to the
ancient custom of New England. After prayers, Jasper
put up his book and took himself and his dip off
to bed, making us a military salute at the door by
way of good night.</p>

<p>When he was gone, and Mr. Bulkley had lighted
the pipe, which was to wind up the labors of the day,
he said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I noticed that you were a little surprised at seeing
Jasper make himself so much at home here."</p>

<p>I made a dubious sort of a bow, hardly knowing
whether I should acknowledge such a feeling about a
matter which was clearly none of my business.</p>

<p>"It was natural enough," he continued, "that you
should have wondered at it. But Jasper and I have
slept too many years under the same tent for me to
mind having him in the same room with me when he
has done his work."</p>

<!-- v1 page 29 -->

<p>"Under the same tent, sir?" I repeated, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied; "he has never left me
since he came to my rescue at Brandywine, when I
was lying flat on the field with an ounce of lead in
me, which, for that matter, I carry about with me still.
The bayonet was raised that would have finished the
business, had not Jasper despatched the grenadier
that stood over me, and carried me off on his back to
the rear."</p>

<p>"So you served in the Revolutionary War, sir?" I
exclaimed. "Were you long in the service?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well," he answered, smiling. "I began at
Lexington and ended at Yorktown. I don't know
that any one can say more than that. You see that
old firelock," he continued, pointing to a fowling-piece
of formidable length and venerable age, which
was crossed over the fireplace with a silver-hilted
sword; "that was the gun with which I left Parson
Sanborne's study for Lexington on the morning of
the 19th of April, and the old sword is one I picked
up on the Boston road that day and wore for the next
seven years."</p>

<p>"In what capacity did you serve, sir?" I inquired,
a little bewildered by this new flood of ideas.</p>

<p>"Why, I began as chaplain," he replied. "But as
there was more need of the arm of flesh, and as there
was an especial lack of educated men for officers, I
took a commission from General Washington; and I
ended as a captain, doing the duty of brigade-major.

<!-- v1 page 30 -->

My health was not firm at that time, and I thought
a campaign would do me good; and, being once in
for it, I found it hard to break off, and so kept on to
the end."</p>

<p>"And Jasper?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jasper was born the slave of Colonel Cuyler,
of New Jersey, who emancipated him on his consenting
to enlist, and afterwards employed him as his servant,
a soldier being allowed to every officer, for that
purpose. Colonel Cuyler dying of a fever consequent
on the exposures of the campaign in the Jerseys,
Jasper remained in the ranks until he was taken
by me, at his request, as my servant. It was of some
advantage to him in the way of mounting guard and
the regular drills; though he was still on the rolls,
and required to return to active duty whenever in
the neighborhood of the enemy."</p>

<p>"And he has been with you ever since?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Ever since," he replied; "and now I think it
would be rather hard to oblige him to mope by himself
in his kitchen when he has done his day's work.
His greatest pleasure is to sit in the corner of my
fireplace in winter and watch me as I read or write.
He does not come so regularly in summer; but he
comes when he pleases, and I think I should be a
beast to deny so cheap a pleasure to my old companion
in arms and most faithful friend. At any rate, I do
not intend doing so. Indeed, in my solitude, his
presence in the long winter evenings, though not society,

<!-- v1 page 31 -->

is human companionship, and I am confident I
am the better for it."</p>

<p>I cordially expressed my concurrence of opinion
on all these points; and then Mr. Bulkley, knocking
out the last ashes of his pipe, (he never lapsed into
the later heresy of cigars), laid it in its place, and
proposed to show me the way to my chamber. This
done, he shook hands with me as he bade me good-night;
and I lay awake for some time after I had
gone to bed, ruminating over the revolution which
the last fifteen minutes had wrought in my first ideas
of the minister and his man.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE TORY AND HIS DAUGHTER.</p>

</div>

<p>"PRAYER-BELL rung yet, Charley?" said I,
gaping fearfully, the next morning, awakened
by hearing somebody putting down my shoes by my
bedside, and catching a glimpse of a black face
through my half-shut eyes. "Not the second bell,
I hope."</p>

<p>"It's me, sir; it's Jasper," said that worthy functionary,
as he moved softly towards the door; "the
young college gentlemen always ask me that the first
morning, sir. We don't ring no bell, sir; but master
breakfasts at six, and has prayers afterwards. It's
just five, now, sir."</p>

<p>And the truth streamed in upon me, with the sun
through the uncurtained windows, that I was an exile
from college; that this was Wensley, and not Cambridge;
and that the sable form which had just quietly
vanished was a revolutionary hero, and not Charley
Richmond&mdash;a cadet of an ancient family of color,
which had served for several generations the wealthier
sort of students in the capacity of what the English
Cantabs call a <i>gyp</i>, and the Oxonians a <i>scout</i>; which
Mr. Thackeray, when he rolled the two single universities

<!-- v1 page 33 -->

into one as Oxbridge, also amalgamated into a
<i>skip</i>.</p>

<p>As I had an hour before me, there was no occasion
for hurrying myself; so I lay still and revolved in my
mind the current chapter of my history. A quarter
of an hour was all that was thought necessary in
those good old days, before shower baths and hair
gloves, for anybody's toilet; so I had time enough
and to spare. Bless my soul, I must have a good
hour and a half to get myself up for the day now!
These hygienic and physiological new lights have a
great deal of other people's time to answer for. I
lay still; and, as I lay, that mysterious homesick
feeling which always comes over me (I wonder
whether it does over other people) the first time I
wake in a strange place took full possession of me.
I had left no home; my parents were both dead; I
had neither brother nor sister; I hated college, or
fancied I did, and had just as much business to be
in Wensley as anywhere else; and yet I felt the
strongest disposition to cry at finding myself there.
And if I did actually cry, men do more unmanly
things than that, and pretend they are not ashamed
of themselves, every day of their lives. Perhaps the
excitement of finding myself in a new place, quickening
the flow of my ideas, brought these facts, or the
emotions they naturally excite, with a fresh shock to
my mind; and surely they were enough to make anybody
cry.</p>

<p>But I am no metaphysician, and shall make no

<!-- v1 page 34 -->

attempt to puzzle other people by trying to explain
what I do not understand myself. But such is the
psychological fact, whether it belongs to my special
idiosyncrasy or not. I never felt the emotion more
strongly than I did, years afterwards, the first morning
I opened my eyes in London, and, casting them
out of the window of my chamber on the roof of
the Adelphi, saw the great dome of St. Paul's rising, as it
were, out of a surging sea of fog, and heard the ceaseless
rush and roar of life chafing in the channels far
beneath me. It was a moment which I had been
looking forward to for long years as the Christian
pilgrim to that of the first glimpse of the holy sepulchre,
or the Mussulman to the supreme instant that
gives him the vision of the tomb of the Prophet. I
had reached "the Mecca of <i>my</i> mind," and yet I
thought of everything rather than of it. I have
heard it said that, when a man is drowning, the
whole of his past life rushes before his dying eyes in
an instantaneous phantasmagoria. Well, it seemed
as if my plunge into the boiling ocean of London
worked the same miracle with me. The roar of its
tide was in my ears; but I heard it not. All of my
past life, especially every sad and tender image,
came streaming through my mind in a flash of
thought, and oppressed me with a bitter pang of
homesickness&mdash;Heaven knows why. So it was,
though I don't pretend to expound the philosophy
of it. But, then, as it has nothing in particular to do
with my story, it is of the less consequence.</p>

<!-- v1 page 35 -->

<p>But the bluest of devils cannot long withstand the
genial influences of early sunlight and of youth,&mdash;that
early sunlight of life, God bless it! though the
benediction is quite superfluous, for God <i>will</i> bless
it whether or no; and mine vanished before their
potent exorcism by the time I was half dressed.
And by the time my toilet was finished I felt no
more longing to hear the cracked voice of the chapel
bell, or the stamping to and fro over my head, and
the scuffling of feet backwards and forwards in the
entry and on the college stairs,&mdash;the familiar sounds
which I had yearned for when I first awoke,&mdash;and
was well content to accept in their stead the riotous
vivacity of the birds and the undertoned hum of the
insects in the trees on both sides of my chamber.
For it filled the entire breadth of the house, and it
was not very broad, for all that, and had two windows
on one side, and one on the other; the one behind
occupying a deep cut into the sloping roof, and looking
directly into the thick boughs of a lime-tree
buzzing with insect life. The walls were plastered
and white-washed; a thick beam ran lengthwise
through the ceiling; and so queer was the shape of
the room from the obliquities of the roof that it
would have puzzled a better mathematician than I
was to calculate its contents. There was a strip of
carpet by the bedside, the floor (the face of whose
scenery was of a rather <i>rolling</i> character) being otherwise
bare. A few wooden chairs and a pine table
made up the furniture. But what cared I for those

<!-- v1 page 36 -->

things? God made us men before we made ourselves
upholsterers; and I had not yet passed into the factitious
and out of the natural state.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Osborne," said Mr. Bulkley, as we sat
at breakfast, "do you like your quarters well enough
still to wish to remain in them?"</p>

<p>"I like both my quarters and my company, sir,"
I replied; "and should be very sorry should you determine
not to take me."</p>

<p>"And that would be a pity!" he said,&mdash;"would it
not be, Jasper?" Jasper inclined his assent. "In
fact," the minister went on, "Jasper has been interceding
for you; and the prime minister, you know,
does what he likes at court; and I suppose I must
let him have his way."</p>

<p>"I am greatly indebted to him for his interest,"
said I, bowing with mock gravity towards Jasper,
"and shall endeavor to show myself worthy of his
good opinion."</p>

<p>The minister smiled; but his man took it all in
perfectly good faith, and with serious grace acknowledged
my little speech with his military salute as he
stood firm and erect behind his master's chair.</p>

<p>"Jasper having given his sanction to your remaining,"
Mr. Bulkley resumed, "and you continuing to
wish it, after having a taste of our bachelor's way of
life, I suppose I may as well acknowledge to having
no particular objection to it myself: so we will consider
that as arranged, if you please." And we shook
hands across the table to close the bargain. Though

<!-- v1 page 37 -->

what he said about Jasper's consent was spoken jestingly,
yet I found afterwards that it was literally true
that he would not have received me, had Jasper disliked
the plan.</p>

<p>"As to-day is Saturday," the minister proceeded,
"we will defer our plans of study until Monday,
Saturday is my working day, and shall be your holiday.
Perhaps you would like to get a little acquainted
with the Siberia to which you have been
banished. Or you may use my study just as if I
were not here, or establish yourself in your own
chamber, as you like. We dine at twelve, and drink
tea at six; at which hours you will report yourself,
if you please."</p>

<p>After which Jasper brought the great Bible, and
we had prayers; which done, I whiled away the time
as best I could with old books and cigars, and in
sauntering round the premises in quest of amusement,
which did not seem very easy to be found, till
dinner time. After dinner, as the sun was a little
mitigated by clouds, I set forth upon a voyage of
discovery into the unknown regions round about. I
passed through the village, where my apparition again
caused a general suspension of labor, and variation of
idleness, as long as I was in sight. So I took myself
out of sight as speedily as possible, turning into the
road to your right just after you have crossed the
Quasheen, and winding along its banks. It was a
most charming walk, solitary, shady, with glimpses
of rich pastures dotted with cattle, by the water-side.

<!-- v1 page 38 -->

There was no discordant jar of machinery. The
innocent little stream had not yet been compelled by
the genius of the lamp or of the ring to help build
the palaces of our New England Aladdins; it yet
ran sparkling and dimpling to the sea, without having
to buffet with mill-wheels, and to fling itself headlong,
as it fled, over injurious dams in desperate waterfalls.
Cows stood up to the middle in its shady little bays;
ducks led out their flotilla of ducklings upon its
waters, and swallows dipped in it with none to molest,
or make them afraid. It was a delicious walk, as I
said before.</p>

<p>Here and there along the road was a farm house of
the oldest description of New England rustic architecture,
but not many of them. It seemed as if this little
town were a nook which the tide of improvement,
as we are pleased to call it, had swept round,
and left it overlooked in its haste, leaving it just as it
was a century before. Nor was this effect diminished
by a glance I got at a house, having decidedly the
look of a gentleman's seat, off at my left; for such
were always sprinkled over the face of the New
England landscape. It was a square wooden house,
having a porch in front, with seats on either side,
flaunting with honeysuckles, as I could see at that
distance, with windows in the roof, and an ornamental
balustrade running round it. The ground
sloped up to the house, and, being fine mowing land,
had as lawnish a look as land can well have in our
climate. A few aboriginal oaks stood singly here and

<!-- v1 page 39 -->

there; and there were clusters of shrubbery near the
house, but apparently kept low for the benefit of the
prospect. Beyond the house it seemed as if there
was an old-fashioned avenue of elms running down
the other side of the hill to parts unknown. I passed
about a mile and a half farther, pondering as to who
could be its inhabitants, but meeting no one of whom
I could make the inquiry.</p>

<p>But when I had gone, by my estimation, about
three miles from the village, the clouds which had at
first invited me to go out now more strongly urged
me to go back. They rolled up blacker and thicker,
and seemed almost to touch the tops of the trees,
among which the road sometimes wound. There was
evidently a thunder-shower altogether too near at
hand for my advantage: so I set my face homewards,
and made what speed I could, though with little hope
of escape. I came, however, in sight of the capital
mansion and messuage (as an auctioneer might say)
just described, before the critical moment arrived.
Still I hurried on, and soon found there were other
people in haste besides myself; for just then I heard
the sound of hoofs behind me, and an elderly gentleman
and a young lady on horseback galloped past me.
As they passed they gave a glance of surprise at me,
and presently reined up, and had evidently a brief
exchange of words; or rather the gentleman said
something to his companion, and I could see that
the tassel of her riding-cap waved an affirmative.
He then turned his horse's head towards me, and,

<!-- v1 page 40 -->

putting spurs to his sides, pulled up before me in an
instant.</p>

<p>"Young gentleman," said he, touching his hat as I
raised mine, "there is a violent shower at hand. Let
me beg you to take shelter in my house there," indicating
the capital mansion aforesaid with his riding-whip.
"Pray do not hesitate, for I feel the first drops
already. By striking across that field you will be at
the door nearly as soon as we."</p>

<p>He touched his hat again, and, wheeling round,
galloped off, and he and his companion were the next
instant hid from my sight by a turn of the road. I
was a bashful boy, and felt as awkwardly as such animals
are apt to do in an emergency like this. But
still I had a little rather not spoil my new hat; and,
moreover, the thing had a spice of adventure about
it which could not but make it relishing: so I leaped
the stone wall, and then "set down my feet, and ran,"
to such good purpose that I did actually reach the house
before the pair dashed up, just as the rain was
coming down in good earnest. As there was no time
for ceremony, I stepped up, blushing like the morn,
lifted the young lady off her horse, and set her down
safely under the porch. I had had some little practice
in this line before, having often performed this office
for&mdash;&mdash;; but on the whole it is no concern of yours
who it was for. It is enough that I had had
practice. The young lady hastily bowed her thanks,
and, after giving her habit a good shake, hurried into
the house.</p>

<!-- v1 page 41 -->

<p>The gentleman, having given over the horses to the
servant who ran up to take them, now joined me, and
courteously invited me to walk in. He was a man of
middle height, and well proportioned, though of rather
a slight figure. He was between sixty and seventy;
but as he wore powder it was not easy to tell to which
extreme of the decade he inclined. Perhaps he was
about half way between the two. He had a cultivated
and well-bred voice, as well as deportment, and his
tones were more English than American in their modulations.
And yet he did not look like an Englishman.
His face must have once been very handsome;
though time, and perhaps sorrow, had made their mark
upon it. He gave one the impression of a man that
had suffered, and through suffering had lived more
than his years. He led me into a good-sized and
well-furnished room on the right of the hall-door, and
then through a narrow, arched door, by the farther
side of the fireplace, into a larger back room, which
appeared to be his library, though his collection was
not much. Here I found a wood-fire burning, though
it was hot summer, but which, nevertheless, was exceedingly
acceptable to a damp stranger like myself.
Inviting me to be seated, and sitting down himself,
he said, pointing to the blaze,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I trust you will find this whim of mine, as I find
it is thought to be hereabouts, not a bad one to-day.
You remember, perhaps, the Spanish proverb, that
nobody ever suffers from cold, except a fool or a beggar.
And as I hope I am not quite a fool, and as I know

<!-- v1 page 42 -->

that I am not absolutely a beggar, I am resolved to
guard myself against the inclemency of your summers
as well as of your winters."</p>

<p>"My winters!" thought I to myself: "I should
suppose they were as much yours as mine, my good
sir." But I <i>said</i>, "Many people, I believe, sir, would
be glad to imitate your example, if they had but the
strength of mind."</p>

<p>He smiled and said, "Indeed, it does require some
resolution. I know I had to put forth a good deal
before I could overcome the opposition of Mrs. Warner,
my housekeeper. She would have put out all
my fires on the first of May, and not allowed me
another spark until the first of November, had I
not raised an insurrection in the house."</p>

<p>"Your victory seems to have been complete, sir,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, a perfect Waterloo, my dear sir!" he replied;
"and that, although my undutiful child was inclined
to side with the enemy. A diversion from my own
camp, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"His child!" thought I again; "then she <i>is</i> his
daughter! Well, it's much better than being his
wife." But I <i>said</i>, "I am sure, sir, I have reason
to rejoice at your courage and success. And I imagine
the young lady herself would not be disposed
to question your wisdom, any more than your generalship,
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I dare say not," he rejoined. "I wonder she has
not come down yet. I think that she likes my fire,

<!-- v1 page 43 -->

as well as myself, in her heart; for I often find her
nestling down by it in the mornings and evenings.
Jupiter! what a flash!"</p>

<p>And it was a flash, indeed, followed by an almost
simultaneous crash of long-rattling thunder. We
instinctively rose and approached the window; but
the darkness of the shower had settled down again
over the landscape almost as black as night; while
the heavy drops fell like shot on the roof, and
poured down on all sides in sheets, the spouts being
entirely unequal to the occasion.</p>

<p>"That flash struck not far off," observed my host.
"I hope it has done my trees no damage."</p>

<p>"Your hope comes too late, papa," said a voice
behind us; "for I saw one of the oaks on the lawn
struck as I came down stairs."</p>

<p>"Not the Sachem's Oak!" exclaimed papa. "I
had almost as lief have had the house struck as
that."</p>

<p>"I believe not," she returned; "but I could not
tell certainly, it is so thick and dark. I think it
was the next one to it."</p>

<p>"I will go and see," he said quickly, "if this
gentleman will excuse me." And, without waiting
to see whether I would or not, he hurried out of the
room.</p>

<p>I have had greater calamities befall me since then
than being left alone with a pretty woman. In fact,
I have long since ceased to regard it as a misfortune
at all. But at that particular juncture of my life,

<!-- v1 page 44 -->

I would a little rather that papa had remained with
us. I was getting on pretty well with him; and,
with him to back me, I think I could have encountered
this new form of danger with tolerable
presence of mind. And I must do the enemy the
justice to say that she did not seem to have any
particularly hostile designs towards me. She seated
herself near the fire, but yet sidewise to it, and with
her face turned round, looking out of the window
at the driving storm with an abstracted air, as if
she were thinking not much of that, and still less
of poor me. I don't know whether her attitude
as I have described it will appear to have been a
graceful one to my readers; but if it do not, they
may be assured it is entirely their fault or mine.
The attitude was perfect, and the more perfect because
entirely unstudied and unconscious.</p>

<p>"And so she was handsome?" you will all say.
Handsome! to be sure she was. Do you suppose
I should be writing about her at this present if she
had not been? Currer Bell may broach and preach
her damnable heresy of homely heroines, with pug
noses and carroty hair, if she please. The republic
of letters has no established church; and, if she
can build up a sect on that foundation, she may.
But I belong to the good old orthodox school.
None of your Jane Eyres or Lucy Snowes for my
money! To be sure, this is not a novel, but a veracious
history; and so I have nothing to do but to
tell the simple truth. But I might have held my

<!-- v1 page 45 -->

tongue, I suppose. There is a great deal of talk
nowadays about woman's rights, and I am told
clever things are written about them on both sides.
And then reverend gentlemen write treatises on
"the true sphere of woman," and "woman's mission,"
"the duty of woman," and so on. Now, I
am a practical philosopher, and never meddle with
abstract discussions; but my private notion of the
sphere, the mission, and the duty of woman, is, that
every woman ought to be handsome. It is a duty
she owes to society. That's my simple moral philosophy;
and, till somebody can show me a better,
I shall stand by it.</p>

<p>I think, if you could have seen my heroine,&mdash;for
the dullest reader must have discovered before this
that we have found my heroine at last,&mdash;you would
have acknowledged that she filled her sphere, fulfilled
her mission, and performed her duty; for she
was marvellously handsome. But I am not going
to give an inventory of her charms. It's of no
use; and I do not intend making a fool of myself
by making the attempt. All I shall say is, that
her hair was of a tinge very uncommon in America,
and what I suppose poetical people mean when they
talk about "golden locks" and "sunny tresses"
(not <i>red</i>; I vow and protest it was not red; the
most malicious rival could not have called it so);
while her eyes and eyelashes were as near black as
they could be without actually being so. Her complexion
was the <i>v&eacute;ritable peau de lys</i>, as smooth and

<!-- v1 page 46 -->

pure as the petal of a lily, and, though with the
expression of perfect health, generally as colorless.
But, when passion or emotion did summon the
"blushing apparitions" into her cheek, it was a
sight, indeed, that Raphael might have dreamed of.
And as to her mouth and her teeth, if nature or art
could have improved upon them, I should like to see
the handiwork.</p>

<p class="small">"Quivi due filze son di perle elette,<br/>

Che chiude e apre un bello e dolce labro."</p>

<p>And I would go a good way to see a finer arm and
hand and foot than hers. But I won't describe her.
Only I will say, that the effect of the contrast of her
dark eyes with her hair and skin was as odd as it
was fine. I have never seen more than two or three
of the kind in the course of a pretty extensive and
careful study of the subject.</p>

<p>I thought I must say something, though I dare
say she would not have missed it if I had not; and so
I ventured to suggest,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you are not afraid of thunder and lightning."</p>

<p>"What, I?" she exclaimed, starting from her revery,
and turning towards me. "Oh, no, indeed! I delight
in them."</p>

<p>Delight in thunder and lightning! I must say
I could not sympathize with my fair friend in this
taste. I have not learned to like those unpleasant
explosions yet, and had still less fancy for them then.
But the horrid idea flashed into my mind that she

<!-- v1 page 47 -->

might suspect as much. So, turning with as composed
an air as I could command to a portrait which
hung over the fireplace, but which I could see but
very indistinctly in the gloom of the day and the
room, I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A portrait of your father, I presume?"</p>

<p>"A portrait of papa!" she replied, smiling, and
shaking her head. "Oh, dear, no! Don't you recognize
it as that of his late Majesty?"</p>

<p>His late Majesty! Old Farmer George, whom
Byron had just left practising the Hundredth Psalm
when his "Vision of Judgment" ended&mdash;whose only
merit, according to the same infallible authority, was</p>

<p class="small">"That household virtue, most uncommon,<br/>

Of constancy to a bad, ugly woman."&mdash;</p>

<p>what business had he here, in the heart of his revolted
province? Who could these people be? Before
I could ponder this problem further, the master
of the house came in, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was not the Sachem's Oak, my dear, but the
old one I have been trying to persuade myself to cut
down these two years. But the lightning has taken
it into its own hands now, and has settled the question
forever. It is breaking away, however, and the
shower is passing off to the westward. I have not
heard such thunder since that storm among the Bernese
Alps."</p>

<p>The Bernese Alps! Had they been there, too? I
looked at them with new respect; for you will remember
foreign travel was not as vulgar then as it

<!-- v1 page 48 -->

has become since. It was a distinction, at that time,
to have been abroad: now, the distinction is to have
staid at home. We have become a match for the
English in our migratory habits. James Smith, I
believe it was, who said, <i>apropos</i> to their invasion of
the continent after it was first opened, that soon
there would be a sight set up of an Englishman who
had <i>not</i> been to Rome. I should think it might
be worth Mr. Barnum's while to add to his other
curiosities an American who had not overrun Europe.
But he must make haste, though, or there will not be
one left to be caught.</p>

<p>This, however, gave us something to talk about,
or rather for him to talk, and for me to listen about.
He talked like a man of sense and education; and I
should have been well content to have listened to
him, and to have looked at his daughter, for an indefinite
time. She took no part in the conversation,
except when appealed to by her father, but sat looking
abstractedly into the fire. I could not but feel
that she was not thinking about me. Indeed, I could
not flatter myself that she would ever think of me
again after I had passed out of her sight. I felt
as "young" as David Copperfield did when the
father of the eldest Miss Larkins asked him "how
his schoolfellows did."</p>

<p>But, as we talked, the storm which had "scowled
o'er the darkened landscape" passed away, and the
"radiant sun" extended his evening beam over it
with farewell sweet. I had no longer any excuse for

<!-- v1 page 49 -->

staying. My host rang the bell, and an elderly
matron, whom I suspected to be the housekeeper, of
whose leaning to the anti-Vulcanian theory I had
heard, entered, bringing wine. After partaking of
this then universal hospitality (for as yet temperance
societies were not), I took my leave with many
grateful acknowledgments. The young lady rose, and
graciously returned my parting bow, while her father
accompanied me to the door and wished me a pleasant
walk.</p>

<p>I passed on under the dripping trees vocal with
birds, and over the saturated turf which the slant
sun glorified into beatific diamonds and emeralds, and
through the clear, cool, moist air, but thinking more
of those whom I had left than of the sights and
sounds about me. Nothing had escaped them which
indicated who or what they were. They had shown
no curiosity as to my poor self, had asked no questions
as to my name, home, or business. They evidently
only regarded me in the light of a lad whom
they had saved from a ducking, and should see no
more. Who could they be? Of course I should
pluck out the heart of the mystery when I reached
the parsonage; for Mr. Bulkley must know all about
them. So I made what haste I could, and soon
found myself at the worthy minister's door.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH I LEARN WHO THEY ARE.</p>

</div>

<p>I WAS soon at the parsonage; and, as it was too
early for the minister to have relaxed from his
task of sermon-work, I walked round to the garden
at the back of the house. There I found Jasper, hoe
in hand, whistling merrily as he waged war against
the weeds, which had apparently availed themselves
of a temporary suspension of hostilities, and made a
stand against the foreign intruders upon their native
soil.</p>

<p>"Jasper," said I, "who is it that lives in the large
house on the river road, about two miles from here?"</p>

<p>"The big house with the two rows of trees behind
it?" he asked, in his turn.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said I; "there is but one that I
can mean. Who lives there?"</p>

<p>"Queer man, sir!; queer man, sir!" he replied,
shaking his head mysteriously, and resuming his work
with great gravity.</p>

<p>"Queer or not," I answered, "I suppose he has a
name, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Name!" he responded. "Name enough, sir, for
the matter of that! Bad name, too, sir."</p>

<!-- v1 page 51 -->

<p>"Well, what is it, then? It won't hurt me, will
it? Tell me: I'm not afraid of it," said I.</p>

<p>"Mr. Miles Allerton is his name, sir. They call
him Colonel Allerton. But I don't think he's any
business to be called so here."</p>

<p>"Why not? Why shouldn't he be called so, if he
be a colonel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think they ought to call such sort of
folks so," he replied: "it ain't right. It makes me
mad to hear 'em."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with him, Jasper?" I
asked, my curiosity being a good deal aroused.
"He's an honest man, I suppose, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that," he replied, with an emphatic
stroke of the hoe into the ground; "we didn't
use to think such kind of folks none too honest.
But times is changed from what they used to be."</p>

<p>"He pays his debts, don't he? He isn't a swindler,
I hope?" said I, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, yes, sir! He pays his debts well enough.
Why, he's the richest man this side Boston, they
say!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, in the devil's name, what ails him?
He isn't a Democrat, is he?" I persisted; for I had
moused out that Mr. Bulkley was a stanch Federalist
of the extremest sort, like most of his profession
in New England at that time, and that Jasper was no
whit behind him in zeal.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, no, sir!" he exclaimed with a sort of
deprecating tone, as if he had really gone too far in

<!-- v1 page 52 -->

having excited such a suspicion; "not a <i>Dimocrat!</i>
He ain't so bad as that, sir! He's only an old
Tory."</p>

<p>I laughed heartily at Jasper's distinction; for, like
Yorick, I do love a good one, in my heart. And,
after all, there is something respectable in a well-preserved,
good old prejudice, always provided that it
is old enough. An old gentleman in breeches and
hair powder is a respectable object in all eyes; while
a man in a five-year-old coat is one justly contemptible
to every well-regulated mind. There was something
very comic in this conflict of prejudices in
Jasper's mind. But, on the ethical theory of somebody,&mdash;I
forget who,&mdash;of doing the duty that lay
nearest him, he honestly hated the Democrat of the
present generation more than the Tory of the last.</p>

<p>"What amuses you so much?" said a voice behind
me. And, looking round, I saw Mr. Bulkley, who
had come out to take a turn before tea. "Has Jasper
been saying something witty?"</p>

<p>"Rather wise, sir, than witty," I replied; for I
was a fierce Federalist too. And I told the minister
what had passed between us, and the occasion.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's one of the few points of difference between
me and Jasper," said Mr. Bulkley, smiling.
"He has no charity for the Tories, and thinks it a
weakness in people that they are beginning to forget
to hate them.&mdash;But everybody has not such a memory
as you, Jasper. It doesn't last for fifty years
generally."</p>

<!-- v1 page 53 -->

<p>"I shall never get to like a Tory," replied Jasper
doggedly, "if I live fifty years more. They're
too mean."</p>

<p>"Nor a Democrat either, I suppose?" said the
minister, laughing.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, sir," answered Jasper, <i>con spirito</i>,&mdash;"not
if I live a hundred."</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley and I laughed again, and then paced
up and down, side by side, the centre walk of the
garden, which was nicely edged with box, and hard
with well-rolled gravel.</p>

<p>"So you took shelter at Colonel Allerton's," said
he, "during the thunder shower. You were in luck;
for it is not easy to get admission there. And did
you see Miss Eleanor, too?"</p>

<p>I told him all the circumstances of my adventure,
and concluded by begging him to let me know who
these mysterious people were.</p>

<p>"All I know about them," he replied, "is soon told.
You must have heard of the famous Tory, John Allerton,
so notorious in colonial history before the Revolution.
He was attorney-general, and afterwards judge
of admiralty, under the crown, in Hutchinson's time,
and went away with the Tories. Well, this gentleman
is his son, who, at the time the siege was formed, was
in college, and, not being recalled in season, was cut
off from the town and prevented from joining his
family. We kept him, together with other members
of Tory families in the same predicament,&mdash;women
and children chiefly,&mdash;in a sort of honorable captivity,

<!-- v1 page 54 -->

as hostages for the good treatment of the families of
the patriots who were detained in Boston. I was
acquainted with Judge Allerton's family, and was able
to make the young man more comfortable than he
would have been otherwise."</p>

<p>"Was there no communication between these prisoners
at large, in and out of the town, and their
families all that time?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"When a flag was sent in or out on other business,"
he replied, "open letters, to be inspected by the authorities
on either side, might be exchanged. That
was all that could be allowed. I tried to get permission
for young Allerton to go into the town when it
became tolerably certain that it must be evacuated;
but the apprehension of the mischief that the British
troops might do as they retreated prevented our parting
with any pledge of their good behavior. He was
sent to Halifax, however, in the first cartel that came
in for exchange of prisoners afterwards."</p>

<p>"And what was his history after that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I merely know its outlines," replied Mr. Bulkley.
"The British government behaved well, as you know,
to the loyalists who had suffered in its cause. Judge
Allerton received a liberal compensation (though
necessarily not a full one) for his losses, and was
appointed chief justice of Barbadoes, where he died.
This son, the only child he had, received a commission
in the army, and rose early to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
He resigned, however, many years ago, on
his marriage with Esther Arbuthnot."</p>

<!-- v1 page 55 -->

<p>"And who was she, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"She was the daughter of Peter Arbuthnot, another
famous Tory. He was registrar-general. I remember
her well, before the siege, as a pretty little girl. Her
father was made a commissary, and afterwards became
a contractor, and made a large fortune in Mr. Pitt's
first war against the French Revolution. This, I presume,
all went to his daughter, Mrs. Allerton; for his
only son died before him, in Jamaica, of the yellow-fever.
I knew him well, poor fellow; and so did
your father."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Allerton is dead, too, I suppose,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, she died, ten years or more ago, in the south
of England, where they lived after their marriage,
chiefly."</p>

<p>"And how came they in this country again?" I
inquired; "and when did they come?"</p>

<p>"They came about two years ago," he replied;
"but the why and wherefore I do not profess to
know. Mr. Hayley, his man of business in Boston,
told me that it was to look after the landed estates of
his great-uncle, Ralph Clarke, who died without heirs,
just as Madison's war began, in 1812, and which
escheated to the state. He has sent in a petition
to the General Court, and is prosecuting it; but the
estates are hardly valuable enough to account for
such an exertion, even if his chance for getting
them were better than it is like to be."</p>

<p>"But how came they here?" I asked. "What

<!-- v1 page 56 -->

particular attraction drew them to Wensley of all
places in the world?"</p>

<p>"Why, I believe I must do my modesty the violence
to say that I consider myself a main cause of
that," responded the minister. "I was in Boston,
attending the convention,<sup>1</sup> during election week, just
at the time he came to town from New York, where
he arrived from England, and happened to meet him
at dinner at General Bradstreet's. He remembered
our old acquaintanceship, which was renewed the
sooner that I was almost the only one surviving of
his former friends. He came up to visit me; and
just at that time the estate where he now lives
was for sale. Old Mr. Remington, whose father
built it early in the last century, was just dead;
and his third wife, promoted to be his widow, preferred
living in Boston, where her wisdom has
been justified," he went on laughing, "by her marrying
the other day, Dr. Hobart of the New East
Church."</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>Of Congregational ministers, held that week in Boston from time
immemorial.]</p>

<p>"And so he bought the Remington estate," suggested
I, to bring him back from this episode.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "its solitariness seemed to suit
him; and there was something about the lay of the
land and the disposition of the trees which reminded
him of Walford Hall, his house in Devonshire. I
flatter myself that my being his neighbor was no
objection in his eyes; but I am quite sure that there

<!-- v1 page 57 -->

being no other within seven miles was a still greater
inducement."</p>

<p>"It must be rather dull for the young lady,"
said I.</p>

<p>"One would think so," said he; "but she seems
perfectly well content with their way of life. She
is a charming creature, although a most loyal subject,
like her father, to his Britannic Majesty. Still, she
has won all hearts in the town by her beauty and
graciousness. Even Jasper has surrendered to her;
though he still holds out against the old Tory, her
father."</p>

<p>"And is he the only one of the Wensleyans that
holds fast to the faith that their fathers delivered to
them&mdash;of hating the Tories?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Almost the only one," he replied. "Colonel
Allerton's liberality, and kindness of heart, have
succeeded in driving away the prejudices and suspicions
with which he was at first regarded. Even
Jasper's professions of dislike I fancy to be rather a
point of honor than of feeling with him. Corporal
Berry himself, although he has limped through life
cursing the Tories, ever since he was shot through the
leg at the time of Arnold's attack on New London,
could not withstand the battery of blankets, flannels,
meat, wine, and firewood, that was kept up on his
citadel at the north part of the town, when he was
close besieged by the rheumatism last winter. He
even calls his benefactor 'colonel;' which Jasper has
not made up his mouth to do yet," he added, laughing.</p>

<!-- v1 page 58 -->

<p>"You give them a good character, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"No better than they deserve," he answered.
"I have unlimited authority to call upon him in case
of any distress in the town. And, what is better, he
and his daughter often visit in person poor people in
sickness or other trouble, to see for themselves what
they really most need. He says it is a habit they
formed at home&mdash;by which he means England, of
course. And what else do you think he is going to
do for the town, sir?"&mdash;and he rubbed his hands
gleefully at the thought,&mdash;"a clock, sir, a clock for
the meeting house! He had old Willard up here
last month, and has given him an order for one of his
best. It will set the poor old thing quite on its legs
again." And he looked affectionately at the tower,
as if he beheld in vision its future glories.</p>

<p>"Deacon Holt," he went on, "objected to it as
unscriptural, at first; but I put him down with the
dial of Ahaz, and clinched the argument by the examples
of the Old South and other sound churches of
Boston. So it is all settled now, sir, and the orthodoxy
of the clock is fully established."</p>

<p>And he laughed out one of his ringing, musical
laughs, which I still hear in my mind's ear, (why
should not the mind have an ear as well as an
eye? it certainly should be allowed the full possession
of all its senses), and then led the way
into the house to tea. As the sabbath began at
Wensley on Saturday night at sundown, ceasing at
sundown on Sunday, I retired to my chamber after

<!-- v1 page 59 -->

tea, and spent the evening in preparing an epistle
to the Deipnosophoi, describing the adventures of
which their enthusiasm for the vital principles of
their foundation had been the remote cause. This
finished, and directed to Tom Stacey, the worthy
head of the order, I went to bed with even a better
opinion of Wensley, as a place of academic retirement,
than I had the night before.</p>

<!-- v1 page 60 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">MY FIRST SUNDAY IN WENSLEY.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next morning was a truly delicious one. The
shower of the afternoon before had cleared
the air, and breathed a fresh life of verdure into the
trees and grass. White, fleecy, <i>Ruysdaelesque</i> clouds
floated in the azure depths, relieved in sharp perspective
against the blue; and their gigantic shadows
gave a fresh grace to the landscape as they glided
over meadow, stream, and tufted hill. I sat at my
window, after breakfast, and revelled in the affluence
of rural sights and sounds and smells which were
poured out around me. I had left the minister in
sole possession of his study, both that he might give,
if he chose, a finer edge and point to the spiritual
shafts he had been forging the day before, to be
aimed on this at the hearts of his flock, and also
because, though there was nothing in the least grim
about his piety, he maintained a uniformity of seriousness
in his deportment on Sundays very different
from his working-day manner, which made it more
agreeable to me to sabbatize by myself in my own
room.</p>

<p>We often hear of the sabbath stillness of a day or
place; and it seems to be generally taken for granted,

<!-- v1 page 61 -->

because Sunday is a day of rest, that it is, therefore,
a day of unusual quietness. Now, it was not so
at Wensley. On the other six days of the week
the very spirit of repose seemed to be brooding
over the town. Sitting at my back window, which
commanded a lovely bend of the Quasheen, always
brimming to the brink but never overflowing, with
rich fields sprinkled with timber sloping down green
and firm to its very margin, and, on the farther side,
with the sweetest little wooded knoll lying clasped in
its embrace,&mdash;sitting there, I say, one might imagine
one's self leagues away from any habitation or haunt
of men. No sight or sound was there that was not
intensely rural. The silence was audible, and made
only the more palpable to the mind by the chirping
of birds, the hum of insects, the quiver of the leaves,
and the rippling of the waters. And on the street
side it was only now and then that an ox-cart came
creaking lazily along the road, or a barefooted urchin
loitered whistling by as he drove the cows to pasture,
or home again. It always seemed to me as if it were
an outlying dependency of the Castle of Indolence,
just beyond the park-palings, and that one might see
its dreamy turrets rising above the woods in the
distance, if one would but take the trouble to look for
them. I dare say it was not a great way off.</p>

<p>But on Sunday it was quite another thing. Then
there were sights and sounds that gave a human interest
to the scene. As long as Mr. Bulkley lived,
there was no schism in Wensley. Methodists, Baptists,

<!-- v1 page 62 -->

and Universalists refused to disturb the quiet
of his parish while it was his. But when he slept
with his predecessors, the revolutionary spirit, which
had been controlled by the personal affection felt for
him, broke forth; and its monuments are to be seen
in three or four ugly little wooden conventicles, which
perk their pert cupolas in the face of the good old
meeting-house, like so many irreverent Quakers or
Anabaptists giving themselves airs of equality in the
presence of an ancient, substantial, steeple-crowned,
Puritan magistrate. But in my time there was no
open dissent. The meeting-house at the Centre was
the only one in the town. It was a large building,
with two galleries, and every part of it was entirely
filled every Sunday. It was a sight which has not
been seen in New England, I suppose, for twenty
years at least; if, indeed, this were not the last surviving
example of an absolutely unbroken parish.</p>

<p>After the first bell had rung, the roads leading to
the meeting-house, which was fully commanded by
my window, began to be alive with church-goers, and
to pour an increasing tide upon the green on which
the building stood. Some came on horseback, but
more in bellows-top chaises, or gigs with leathern
heads, that shut back with springs, and had a certain
resemblance to the follicular convenience from which
they derived their name. A few were conveyed in
vehicles which have been long numbered among the
extinct races, and which had come down from the
middle of the last century. Square-top chaises they

<!-- v1 page 63 -->

were denominated, or gigs with immovable leathern
heads, and little windows at the back and sides.
Some of them had a seat in front for a boy to sit upon,
and drive. But modern Wensley (or young Wensley,
as it would be called now) turned up its nose at
these venerable relics of a former generation, and (to
anachronize a little <i>slang</i>) voted them "slow;"
which, indeed, they were.</p>

<p>But the greater part of the people, young and old,
honestly trudged on foot. They came trooping along
in families, and sometimes in pairs, the latter not
unfrequently looking rather sheepish and conscious;
though I am sure I don't know why they should.
They were perfectly well-behaved young men and
women for all I could see. Arrived at the church,
the "leathern conveniences" were put in the horse-sheds
which formed a sort of outwork on three sides
of the meeting house. The women all entered the
house as they arrived, and were seen no more by me
for the time; but the men remained without, standing
about the door or dispersed in groups over the
green, discussing the weather, the crops, or the next
election. It was their weekly exchange.</p>

<p>As I watched this lively scene, the second bell began
to ring. Presently Jasper tapped at my door to
let me know that the minister was ready to proceed,
and I incontinently joined him. The moment the
door of the parsonage opened, and the minister was
seen to issue forth, the bell began to toll, and the men
about the church-door to hurry in. Mr. Bulkley,

<!-- v1 page 64 -->

leaning upon my arm, walked on erect and stately;
while Jasper, no less stately and erect, followed us, a
few paces behind, with a music-book under his arm.
As we advanced in this state, I saw a plain carriage
and pair drive up from the direction of the bridge
and stop at the meeting-house door. Of course I
knew that it must contain my hosts of the thunder-shower.
The horses were spirited and restive; and,
before the elderly coachman could descend from his
box, a white-headed old man hobbled up, and opened
the carriage-door and let down the steps. The minister
pressed my arm, and said, with rather a weekdayish
look out of the corner of his eye, in a low
tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Corporal Berry opening Colonel Allerton's carriage
door! Toryism is triumphant in Wensley, I'm
afraid;&mdash;or would be, but for Jasper."</p>

<p>A guttural ejaculation, rather emphatic than distinct,
and which, we will charitably hope, had no
element of profanity in it, was heard behind us, expressive
of the patriotic consistency of that veteran's
opinions. There was a slight symptom of incipient
rebellion in the region round about the minister's
mouth; but he resolutely quelled the insurrectionary
tendency, and arrived at the church door the very
personification of gravity.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley strode up the broad aisle with majestic
self-possession, the whole congregation remaining
standing to receive him. I, who was not accustomed
to be the target at which such volleys of eyeshot

<!-- v1 page 65 -->

were directed as were now aimed at me, followed him
with less ease and a good deal more self-consciousness.
Arrived at the pulpit-end of the aisle, he
opened the door of his pew, the front one on the left-hand
side, and, waving me into it, ascended the pulpit-stairs
as a king might mount to his ancestral
throne. As soon as he had disappeared in its vast
recesses, a noise not unlike an irregular volley of
musketry was heard over the house, being that of the
seats slamming down, which had been turned back on
their hinges, for room's sake. It was a fortunate
hearing for me; for, not being acquainted with this
fact in the natural history of the old parish churches
in the country, I should have infallibly seated myself
on the floor but for the warning sound. This
same salute was repeated every time that the congregation
resumed their seats after rising for any of the
services, and was generally executed with a fervor
commensurate, as I suppose, with the warmth of their
devotion.</p>

<p>Jasper I had missed as soon as we entered the
house; and I was pleased to discern him belaboring a
huge bass viol in the choir (for that innovation had
reached even the seclusion of Wensley) when we
stood up at singing time. I also discerned that the
Allerton pew was on the opposite side of the aisle,
answering to the minister's. But devout church-goers
need not to be told that this is one of the most unfavorable
situations for personal observations of an
edifying nature, that the economy of an ecclesiastical

<!-- v1 page 66 -->

interior affords. A place in the deacon's seat&mdash;where
Deacon Holt and Deacon Williams, the one burly and
red-faced, and the other lank, lean, and squinting in
every direction, sat with their backs to the pulpit, overlooking
the audience&mdash;would have been a much more
eligible position for enjoying some of the incidental
advantages of public worship. As it was, I could only
observe that Miss Allerton was quietly attentive to
what was going on; while her father, like an old soldier
as he was, fairly dropped asleep with a cannonade
of the heaviest sort thundering over his head, aimed
at the errors of the Church of England, of which communion
he and his daughter were the only two members
within a dozen miles. But the serene height,
away up under the sounding-board, from which he
man&oelig;uvred his ecclesiastical artillery, saved the good
parson from the mortification of seeing how his hot
shot passed over the head of the enemy.</p>

<p>Dear old man! he never held back his hand from
smiting the heretical Philistines that infested the
region round about. His were good old-fashioned polemical
sermons, well fortified with texts of Scripture,
and garnished with quotations in the original tongues,
which were none the less relished by the congregation
because they did not understand them. It
confirmed them in the faith, which was only second
to that they entertained for Holy Writ, that he was
the most learned man in the world. To be sure, there
must have been all this time an undercurrent of
heresy loosening the hold of some of his people upon

<!-- v1 page 67 -->

their old anchorage, as we know from its breaking
openly forth as soon as his restraining power was
removed, and scattering abroad the barks which had
remained peacefully in the old harbor as long as he
had command of the fleet. But, during that period,
no piratical Universalist, nor buccaneering Methodist,
ventured to hoist a flag in the calm waters of Wensley.
But he kept his batteries pounding away at
them, and at all dissentients from the strictest rule
of the ancient faith of New England, all the same as
if they were within point blank range of his guns. I
have often thought whether this persistent warfare
upon his theological enemies, and the constant statement
of their arguments, which was necessary to give
force to his refutations, might not have had something
to do in bringing about that dispersion which
followed so soon after his death.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley was, as I have said, a Calvinist of the
very straitest sect; and he was none the less earnest
a one for having become such, as the Quakers say,
"by way of convincement." He was born and bred
in the Arminian, or Latitudinarian, school of the last
century; and when that form of faith lapsed into
Unitarianism at the beginning of this, he was at first
carried by the tide into those waters. The investigation,
however, which the Unitarian controversy induced,
led him ere long to cut away from his old
moorings, and to drop his anchor where he thought it
would take a firmer hold. But, surely, never did a
more genial and affectionate spirit qualify the severe

<!-- v1 page 68 -->

necessities of religious logic. A milder and kinder
soul never looked forward to the ultimate damnation
of the vast majority of mankind, including all heathendom,
ancient and modern, and all unregenerate
infancy; for he was not a man to shrink from the
logical consequences of his premises. He pitied the
Unitarians; but he cordially despised those divines,
claiming to hold the good old Orthodox faith, who
devised ways of escape from the stern results of the
doctrines of election and reprobation, of original
sin and redemption by grace. He used to call them&mdash;&mdash;;
but, on the whole, it's no matter what he used
to call them. It was not a complimentary epithet.</p>

<p>But not only did he keep at bay during his time
all avowed adversaries of the faith that was in him,
but he kept at a distance, also, all irregular practitioners
even of the regular school. "How many years
have you preached here, sir?" I asked him one day.
"I have <i>reigned</i> here," he replied, nodding his head
cornerwise at me with an indescribable look of fun
out of his gray eyes,&mdash;"I have <i>reigned</i> here forty
years save one." And it was very much so. It was
his business to take care of the souls of his parish;
and he would have no assistance but such as he
chose to call in on his own responsibility. No strolling
revivalist, or starveling evangelist, ever ventured to
set foot on the remotest corner of his territories as
long as his sway lasted. Had he heard of such an
incursion, I will not say that he would have taken
down the firelock of Lexington, or drawn the sword

<!-- v1 page 69 -->

of Yorktown, from their honorable retirement over his
fireplace, to vindicate the integrity of his soil; but I
do think he would have charged the invader, at the
head of Jasper, gold-headed cane in hand, and driven
him over the border, an example to all such intruders
for the time to come. And the whole parish would
have stood by him.</p>

<p>For my own part, I had many a sermon launched
at my head during the time I lived with him, as I
sat defenceless under the shadow of his pulpit. For
I was (to use another Quakerism) a "birthright"
Unitarian; and he doubtless felt it to be his duty
to set in order before me the errors of my hereditary
faith. But it was all in vain. I knew nothing of
the arguments on my side of the question: indeed,
I could not well see that there was any such thing as
standing up before the battalions of texts, and squadrons
of syllogisms, with which he bore down upon
me, and rode furiously over me. But, though he could
overrun me, he could not keep possession of me. All
I knew was that my father and mother had been
Unitarians; and I regarded it as a point of honor,
binding upon me as a gentleman, not to forsake the
faith in which they had lived and died. I was by no
means clear that my Mentor was not right, and that
the doom which he so fervidly described as that of
all such misbelievers did not impend over my head.
But that made no difference. It merely gave me a
kind of exhilaration of spirits (I neither account for
the phenomenon nor defend it: I merely describe

<!-- v1 page 70 -->

the sensation), such as a suspicion of danger, or the
knowledge that he is considered as exposed to it, is
apt to inspire in a lad of spirit. And I rather think
I was quite as well fitted to die for my faith, in a
war of religion, or at the stake, as a good many heroes
and saints who have won for themselves the crown
of martyrdom. But all Mr. Bulkley's prelections for
my benefit were confined to Sunday and the pulpit.
He never labored for my conversion in private. Either
he saw that I had a good share of that virtue which
we call firmness in another when it answers our purposes,
and obstinacy when it thwarts them, and so
knew it would be of no use, or else he thought that
his Sunday labors would be more likely to act favorably
on my mind if he left them to their natural influences
during the week, without disgusting me with
his zeal by making it a perpetual annoyance. Whatever
his motive might have been, I was very happy
to compound for the result.</p>

<p>When the services were at last over (and it was
an <i>at last</i>, for Mr. Bulkley was none of your twenty-minute
men) and the benediction was pronounced,
I hastily gathered together my hat and gloves, and
was for joining in the precipitate retreat I had always
seen expected from all the churches I had ever attended
before. But I had no sooner thrown open
the pew-door, and put one foot out of it, than I saw
that all the rest of the congregation remained standing,
with their faces turned towards the broad aisle. I
drew back, and, raising my eyes, encountered those

<!-- v1 page 71 -->

of Colonel Allerton, who stood facing me. He smiled
at me, as if understanding my case (very likely it
had been his own once), and bowed, as if recalling our
interview of the day before. I returned his bow, not
a little abashed at finding myself again the centre of
all the eyes Wensley had in its head, and, abiding
the result, presently perceived that it was the custom
of the town (once universal throughout New England)
to wait and let the minister go out first. Presently
Mr. Bulkley descended the pulpit-stairs, not having
apparently hurried himself at all, and passed slowly
down the aisle, bowing royally from side to side in
acknowledgment of the rustic salutations which he
received. As soon as he approached me, he made
me a sign to follow him, and then shook hands with
Colonel Allerton, who joined him in his progress
through the capital of his dominions.</p>

<p>It was a necessary consequence of this order of
procession, that Miss Allerton and I came out face to
face into the aisle. She graciously returned my bow;
and we walked after the elders, side by side, kindling
yet more speculation in all the eyes of Wensley, eager
to spy out what I could be. As we came out into
the porch, the two gentlemen remained a little on one
side in conversation, and I proceeded to put the young
lady into the carriage which stood ready drawn up at
the door. I hoped that she had experienced no harm
from the shower yesterday afternoon; which hope, she
was able to inform me had become fruition. I then
informed her that it was an uncommonly fine day,

<!-- v1 page 72 -->

and on this point I am happy to say our views cordially
coincided. What I should have stated next, I
can hardly imagine; for the congregation were now
swarming out, and many were lingering within earshot
to discover what sweet influences this "bright
particular star" of theirs was shedding upon me; and
the consciousness of this fact did not help to concentrate
my ideas. But, fortunately, just at that
moment her father approached, and, as he stood with
one foot on the carriage-step, he offered me his hand,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Osborne, I am happy to know your father's
son. I met him often, and knew him well, at Paris,
when I was there during the peace of Amiens."</p>

<p>I bowed and blushed my acknowledgments for his
goodness.</p>

<p>"I hope," he continued, "that I shall have the
pleasure of seeing you at Woodside at some time
when you can have a less stormy reception than that
you had yesterday."</p>

<p>"I could not have a kinder one, I am sure, sir,"
I replied, "nor one that I should be more happy to
experience again, if you will allow me to pay my
respects to you and to Miss Allerton."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said he, smiling; "only
without the thunder and lightning, if you please.
We three may meet again, I hope; but not, I trust,
in thunder, lightning, and in rain. So good morning."</p>

<p>And they drove away, leaving me upon the steps.
And now, I suppose, the sagacious reader will expect

<!-- v1 page 73 -->

an account of my sensations; for of course he (or
she) takes it for granted that I fell fearfully in love
with the fair Eleanor at first sight. But they must
wait a while. I am not quite ready to go into the
confessional just yet, with his (or her) ear glued to
the grating. Perhaps I scarcely knew how I felt
myself; for I have more than once acknowledged
my inaptitude for the dissections and demonstrations
of metaphysical anatomy. And perhaps it is hardly
fair to require a man to conduct his own autopsy.
But whatever may have been my own state of mind,
one fact, mortifying as it may be, I must needs confess.
It must be admitted that the beautiful Eleanor
did not fall in love with me either at first or second
sight. Perhaps it was no proof of her taste or discernment;
but the fact cannot be denied. Her
deportment towards me was perfectly kind and well-bred;
but I could not help feeling that my image
might never again occur to her, if not recalled by my
bodily presence. Of course, such a conviction was
not flattering to my vanity (if, indeed, I or any <i>man</i>
was ever subject to such a weakness); but did it go
near breaking my heart? It is altogether too near
the end of a chapter to enter into an inquiry of this
intricacy, and so it must be adjourned to a day
future. I am none of your epic writers, who dive
at once into the middle of things, and then plunge
and splash about until they have somehow or
another brought the beginning and end together. I
am a plain narrator of a simple passage of biography,

<!-- v1 page 74 -->

and tell things just as they happened, and must be
allowed to take my own way, or I shall be sure to
make a botch of the whole thing.</p>

<p>When they were gone, Mr. Bulkley put his arm
in mine, and we walked off towards the parsonage
together. He told me, what I had surmised before,
that I was what they were talking about, he
having asked Colonel Allerton if he had not known
my father during his public life in Europe. He had
then told the Colonel who I was, and, as I surmised,
the occasion of my residence in Wensley; but he did
not say so, nor did I ask, as the day, if not the subject,
was too serious for a joke, and it would have
been too much for his human nature or mine to have
suppressed one under such favorable circumstances.
The order of our return home was the reverse of that
which had distinguished our march to the meeting-house;
for Jasper, instead of bringing up our rear,
was discerned far in our van, and, in fact, just entering
the parsonage. This apparent breach of subordination,
however, would have been pardoned by a
stricter martinet than I, on beholding the excellent
cold dinner which he had set out in the study, ready
for us on our arrival: at least it would have been, if
the martinet in supposition had been as hungry as
the worthy parson's diatribe against bishops had
made me.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">AN INVITATION AND A DINNER AT WENSLEY.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Allerton pew was empty in the afternoon.
I was not sure that it was not the morning's
onslaught upon the Anglican church that had driven
away its inhabitants, until Jasper assured me that
they never went to meeting in the afternoon. This
he resented as a slight to his master, and as one of
the many mischiefs of the Church of England, for
which the worthy Afrite had much the same mysterious
horror that many excellent people feel for the
Church of Rome, and probably with about the same
degree of knowledge. I discovered, afterwards, that
it was the belief of Wensley that there was a chapel
fitted up at Woodside, where the Colonel read the service
of the church to his daughter and her maid, Ann
Petchell, the only other member of that communion
in Wensley. This was some explanation of the phenomenon
to its curious inhabitants, and perhaps made
them easier under it, on Priest Bulkley's account, of
whose honor they were as jealous as Jasper himself.
I am bound to say, however, that a tolerably intimate
acquaintance with the house in after-times never revealed
to me any such secret place of worship; and

<!-- v1 page 76 -->

Colonel Allerton, with all his various excellences,
seemed to me as little likely to become an amateur
chaplain as any possible man when I came to know
him better.</p>

<p>These facts, or myths, I learned that evening from
the conversation of Deacon Williams and Major
Grimes, and one or two of the parish besides, who
called in to see the parson, and possibly to take a look
at me also. When the sun went down on the day
which bears his name, all the sabbatical shade of seriousness
which rested upon it passed away with him.
By this time Mr. Bulkley's spirits seemed to rebound
from the pressure of unwonted solemnity, and to be
elastic and joyous as usual. His stories were more
and better; he fought his old battles over again with
new vigor; and his jest was more frequent, and his
laugh more resonant, than ever. Sunday evening
was the time when his parishioners usually came to
call on him. Then they were mutually at each
other's service. They had nothing to do; and he
was well content to do nothing in their company
after the labors of the day.</p>

<p>He was a student of men as well as of books;
and I have never known any one better versed in the
niceties of Yankee character and dialect than he.
He could draw them out with marvellous skill, of
which the subjects were perfectly unsuspicious, and
all with no shadow of ill nature, or purpose of satire.
It was simply the study of man, in which he delighted,
and for which he must use such materials as

<!-- v1 page 77 -->

came in his way. As we sat round the wall in summer,
waging internecine war with the mosquitoes or
round the fire in cold weather, discussing all manner
of public and parish politics, with the apples and cider,
which formed the staple entertainment, there were
odd traits of character, and curiosities of expression,
enough to have made the fortunes of a score of
Yankee Hills or Haliburtons. I wonder whether
there are any such people left anywhere in New
England now. I am afraid that they have had all
their sharpnesses ground down by the mill-wheels,
and that they are all reduced to undistinguishable
particles; or that their originality has been all crushed
out of them by the locomotives that fly, screaming
like so many devils, all over the country.</p>

<p>Major Grimes, I must do him the justice to say,
had changed his mode of address towards me since
he had put me in the right way two days before. He
was perfectly respectful and deferential now that he
found that the old priest had actually received me
under his roof, and had discovered, furthermore, who
I was.</p>

<p>"You find Priest Bulkley a fine man, sir," said he,
when he had an opportunity for an aside, "don't you?"
using the epithet "fine," as almost all Americans do,
to denote mental and moral qualities, and not, as an
Englishman uniformly does, to express fine presence
and personal beauty. You may hear an Englishman
say, "He is a very fine man: what a pity that he is
such a fool!" and an American, "She is a very fine

<!-- v1 page 78 -->

woman: what a pity she should be so homely!" But
this is parenthetical.</p>

<p>"From what little I have seen of him, I judge
him to be a very fine man," I answered, coolly.</p>

<p>"You will think more and more of him, sir, the
more you see of him," replied the major. "I didn't
think he meant to take in any more young college
gentlemen; but when I heard who you were, from
Jasper, when he came after your things, I knew he
would."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I. "You knew more of my influence
over him than I did, then."</p>

<p>"Oh, but your father and he used to be so thick
together," rejoined the martial dispenser of toddy;
"they were the greatest cronies you ever saw. And
the old priest isn't a man to forget his friends, alive
or dead, I can tell you. That's why he took you, sir."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad of it, whatever brought it about,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Your father used always to put up his horses at
my place when he came to Wensley. He used to
drive a phaeton and pair; and good horses they were,
I can tell you, sir. Are you fond of horses, sir?"
he went on.</p>

<p>"I like them well enough when I have occasion
for them. I am no judge of them, and have nothing
of the fancy for them that some men have."</p>

<p>"Because, if you ever want a saddle horse, I don't
believe you can find a better in Boston than my
Turk; and for a chaise, (<i>videlicet</i>, gig), you won't

<!-- v1 page 79 -->

often sit behind a better beast than my mare, Black
Sally. Colonel Allerton wanted to buy her; but it
was of no use. I wouldn't part with her."</p>

<p>"The Colonel is a judge of horses, then, I suppose,"
said I.</p>

<p>"A judge! I believe you!" he replied, briskly.
"There isn't a man in New England that knows
horse-flesh better. Why, he keeps five himself
here; and I have heard say that he had near twenty
in England."</p>

<p>"It's no wonder, then," I said, "that he fell in
love with Black Sally. I should have thought he
would have had her at any rate."</p>

<p>"Well," returned her fortunate possessor, rather
drawlingly, "you see he wasn't willing to give me
quite as much as I thought he ought to for her. At
the same time that I offered her (reasonable, too) to
the Colonel, I told him he might have Turk for three
hundred. But he didn't want a saddle-horse just
then, he said. And I'm glad of it, for I should have
missed him training-days. He'll stand cannon, musketry,
music, anything. General Smithett would give
me five dollars a day for him any muster, if I didn't
want him myself."</p>

<p>I was just telling my military friend that I would
certainly try the quality of his stud on my first occasion,
when a quick double knock was heard at the
door, and in another moment the personage whose
name was the last word in our mouths was ushered
into the presence by Jasper. Colonel Allerton entered

<!-- v1 page 80 -->

nimbly and shook hands cordially with the
minister, and afterwards with me; and then, bowing
kindly to the other guests, all of whom rose on his
entrance, he sat down by me.</p>

<p>"The Parson gave us a capital sermon this morning,
Deacon," said he, addressing that functionary,
whose eyes seemed to be more than ever in all places
at the same time. "Rather hard upon me and my
daughter, perhaps. But it is a positive pleasure to
be flogged by some people, it is so cleverly done."</p>

<p>I thought the deacon might have said that it was
well for some other people, that, like tops, the more
they were whipped, the better they slept. But he
did not. Perhaps the dispersion of his vision over
the remoter regions of the meeting house prevented
his seeing what was so directly under his nose. What
he said was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm glad you liked it, sir."</p>

<p>"Liked it! To be sure I did," rejoined the Colonel;
"and, egad, Parson! I should be sorry to be
required to answer you. But I'm not converted, for
all that, you know. You can't suppose me such a
pitiful fellow as to be driven from my religion merely
because I can't defend it against a militant minister,
armed to the teeth, like you. No, no! You must
make another breach before you'll carry me by storm,
much less Eleanor."</p>

<p>"I shall try for it, you may be sure," said Mr.
Bulkley, smiling; "for I am sure that, if you are
hard to carry, you will be easy to hold. There'll be

<!-- v1 page 81 -->

no backsliding in your case, or Miss Eleanor's,
either."</p>

<p>"I think you're right, by Jove!" returned the
Colonel; "and, that we may keep your good opinion
the better, I think we'll not backslide from where we
stand now. But do all you can to unsettle us, pray.
You are perfectly welcome to do so, if you can, I do
assure you."</p>

<p>I felt that if he always had the invention blessed
by Sancho about him, to wrap himself in, and to
serve as</p>

<p class="small">"Feather bed 'twixt castle wall<br/>

And heavy brunt of cannon ball,"</p>

<p>he was really in no great danger from the good parson's
theological gunnery.</p>

<p>After a little more talk between them, in which no
one else joined, unless appealed to, the Deacon and
the Major, followed by the other village visitors, rose
and took their leave. As soon as they were gone
the Colonel said to the minister,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Parson, to show that I bear no malice, I
have walked down this fine night to ask you and Mr.
Osborne to come and dine with me as soon as you can.
When shall it be? To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow is rather soon," Mr. Bulkley replied,
"as Mr. Osborne and I have not yet reduced ourselves
into our order of studies. We had fixed upon
to-morrow to begin."</p>

<p>"Very well. If not to-morrow, fix a day for yourself.
Only let it be some day this week."</p>

<!-- v1 page 82 -->

<p>"Shall it be Thursday?" inquired Mr. Bulkley,
looking over to me.</p>

<p>I intimated that all days were alike to me, and
that Thursday suited me perfectly well. So the dinner
was fixed for Thursday.</p>

<p>"I wish to have you come this week," said the
Colonel, rising to depart, "because I shall have to
go to Boston next week, and may not be able to
return until the very end of it, or the beginning of
the week after. On Thursday, then, I shall expect
you."</p>

<p>And he was taking his leave, when the Parson and
I thought that we would walk with him, the night
being extremely fine, as far as the bridge. Our society
was gladly accepted; and we walked merrily
along the road, accompanied by many a story and
jest and followed by many a laugh. No doubt, as
we passed by the scattered houses of the village, people
said, "That's Priest Bulkley's voice! I should
know it among a thousand. I wonder if anybody's
been took sick. It can't be, though, or he wouldn't
laugh so."</p>

<p>At the bridge we parted&mdash;the Colonel pursuing his
way by the river road, and the Parson and I going
back over our steps.</p>

<p>"It was so like him!" said Mr. Bulkley, as soon
as we were fairly out of hearing.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" I asked. "What was
so like him?"</p>

<p>"His coming so instantly to invite you," said he.

<!-- v1 page 83 -->

"He never hangs fire&mdash;the Colonel. He always goes
off at half-cock."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I replied, "provided he hits as well as
he has to-night, it's not a bad way of going off."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," he returned; "a short aim
is generally the best. But he's a queer man, sir, as
Jasper told you&mdash;an odd compound of openness and
reserve. He seems so transparent, that you would
think you could see straight through him at a glance.
But you will find yourself mistaken. You may look
your eyes blind, without really making him out."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, sir," I asked, "that he has anything
really to conceal, or that he does not choose to
make talk of his private affairs, merely because they
are private?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell," he replied, "I can only say, that
intimate as I have been with him, and the only
person he really associates with for the greatest part
of his time, he has never let a word drop as to any of
them; not even as to his motive for coming to this
country, or the probable length of his stay. It must
be systematic to be so uniform."</p>

<p>"Is he as close as to his life in Europe?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Very nearly," he replied; "that is, as to the
more recent part of it. He talks fast enough about
old times, and very well too. However, it's none of
my business; and I suppose he is of the same opinion.
But you will find him a charming companion,
as well as Miss Eleanor; and I am glad you have got
admission to the house."</p>

<!-- v1 page 84 -->

<p>"Is she as sly as her father?" I inquired. "She
does not seem to have as much to say, at any rate,
judging by the little I saw of her."</p>

<p>"I hardly see enough of her by herself to judge,"
he answered. "And, besides, I am afraid I am
hardly the confidant she would be likely to choose
if she had anything to tell. But it would not
have been strange if her father had sometimes, by
chance, let fall to me something of his history or
plans that might not be proclaimed in Grimes's bar-room.
But no such chance has ever happened.
You know as much of them as I do; and what I
have told you I obtained from other sources than
themselves."</p>

<p>We were now at home; and I bade him good-night,
smiling a little, privily, at the good man's curiosity
(of which he did not seem at all suspicious) to know
of his neighbor's affairs; which, however, I am given
to understand, was no idiosyncrasy of his particular
constitution, nor even one confined to small rural
parishes like Wensley. There was a shade, however,
of wounded feeling in his expression, as if he
had not received quite a just return for the fulness
of confidence he was ready to pour into the bosom
of his friend, at which I had no disposition to smile.
But is there any of us that has not some Bluebeard's
chamber in his heart which he keeps close shut, even
to his nearest and dearest? I do not pretend to know
more than my neighbors; but, from what I have seen
and heard, I surmise that there are married men even,

<!-- v1 page 85 -->

who would be ready to play Bluebeard in good earnest,
if they should find that the very wives of their
bosoms had found a cranny through which to peer
into those prohibited recesses. I wonder what they
would see there. And Mr. Bulkley himself,&mdash;would
he have exposed to the eye of his dearest friend
the sacred though dishonored image of his fatal
Julia, and the troop of recollections, emotions, and
agonies, that waited upon it? I think not, even to
have the veil lifted from the most secret places of
any other life.</p>

<p>Thursday arrived, as it usually does, as nearly in
the middle of the week as possible. And, moreover,
it was a very fine day, so that Mr. Bulkley and I chose
to go to Woodside on foot, rather than disturb the
bones of Smiler, the minister's cross old horse,
from their repose in the stable. Jasper had brushed
up his master's buckles, and made him as smart as
his best coat and breeches (it would hardly be historically
correct to call them his <i>new</i> ones) could make
him; and, as he was a vigorous walker, we were soon
at the hospitable door, which stood open to welcome
us. On the threshold stood the master of the house,
ready to give us a most cordial reception and to usher
us into the presence of his daughter. She looked
handsomer than ever; and as she sat in the window
(which she had had cut down to the ground, an astonishment
to all Wensley) opening into her flower-garden,
in the light of that lovely day, she did look as
lovely as the day itself.</p>

<!-- v1 page 86 -->

<p>The dinner was excellent, such as wealthy gentlemen
of that day used to set before their guests. The
table furniture was handsome but plain, and all display
of wealth was evidently repressed. The table
linen was of the finest of damask, and the service of
Nankin china. The silver forks were the first that
had penetrated to Wensley, and were a marvel, and a
mystery to its oldest inhabitants, who had never heard
of the like. At that time this luxury, which has now
become almost a necessity, was confined, even in the
cities, to the very rich, and, indeed, not always in
daily use with them. So that it is no wonder that
their advent caused a sensation in Wensley, nor that
Jonathan Snell, the Colonel's coachman, should have
condescended one day to take a specimen in his
pocket to show to the astonished inhabitants, at their
special instance, after custom had bred familiarity
with that great man. Mr. Bulkley would never give
in to this <i>new fanglement</i>, as he called it. So he was
always supplied with a good old-fashioned three-pronged
steel fork, with which&mdash;"<i>s&aelig;vitque tridenti</i>"&mdash;he
did manful execution.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley, of course, took Miss Allerton in to
dinner&mdash;which ceremony he performed by bearing
her hand aloft, with an Old-World grace, like a septuagenarian
Sir Charles Grandison. He would have
scorned the custom, had he been cognizant of it, of
clapping a lady's hand under his arm like a brown
paper parcel from the grocer's. The Colonel and I
followed after them; and though he made no sign of

<!-- v1 page 87 -->

remarking the good man's gallantry, he could not
control a little twitching of the muscles about the
corners of the mouth. During dinner I had but
little to say to Miss Allerton beyond taking wine
with her, and assisting her in the dispensation of the
dishes at her end of the table. With two elders at
table, who talked so much and so well as her father
and Mr. Bulkley, there was little occasion or opportunity
for us to display any conversational gifts we
might possess, except that greatest one of listening
well&mdash;that "<i>grand talent pour le silence</i>" which
Talleyrand (or whoever it was) showed more wit
than sense in laughing at. What would he have
done, I should like to know, if there were not some
people willing to hold their tongues?</p>

<p>It was entertainment enough to sit and hear the
two men talk and to look at the lovely mistress of
the house. Colonel Allerton had seen all the public
and literary men of the end of the last century and
the beginning of this, and had known many of them
personally. It was something to hear a man talk
who had seen Garrick during his last season, and had
had the vision of Dr. Johnson rolling along Fleet
Street, though he had never met him face to face as
an acquaintance. He had breakfasted in company
with Gibbon, and had dined at the same table with
Sheridan; and, of all the orators and authors and
beauties of that period, he had had opportunities of
personal observation, and could make report of them
from what his own eyes had seen. Whatever secret

<!-- v1 page 88 -->

reserve he might have to his best friends, of which
Mr. Bulkley had complained, there was no sign of it
in his conversation. Nothing could be more free and
flowing than his stream of talk. It seemed as if you
had only to give it a direction, and it would waft
directly to your feet all the facts of his experience.
But he was not in the least an overpowering talker.
He did not compel you, as Carlyle says Coleridge did,
"to sit as a passive bucket, and be pumped into
whether you consent or not;" which, he goes on
to say justly, "can, in the long-run, be exhilarating to
no creature." On the contrary, he carefully drew
out Mr. Bulkley, and made him appear to his best
advantage, and was very far from neglecting me.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley, indeed, was not a man to be easily
put down. Just to others, he was just also to himself,
and it would have been a clever man that
could rob him of his fair share of what talk was
going on. But nobody who had ever heard him
talk (your oppressive talkers never hear anybody
but themselves) would ever wish that he should talk
any less. Though he had lived in retirement so long,
still his seven-years' apprenticeship to the world,
during the war, had made him a master of that craft,
and had furnished him with inexhaustible stores of
personal recollections, all connected with the most interesting
times and people. Then the very quaintness
of manner and speech which his solitary life
had bred, set off by his extensive though odd reading,
gave a rare raciness to his talk. His intimate acquaintance,

<!-- v1 page 89 -->

too, with the peculiarities of character
and dialect of the country people whom he had made
his study for so long, and his uncommon powers of
mimicry, which he would exert in safe societies,
made him, I think, the most entertaining companion
I ever met in the course of a pretty long acquaintance
with the world.</p>

<p>"The choir sung very well last Sunday, parson,"
said Colonel Allerton, with the slightest possible
glance at his daughter and me. But if there were
any irony in the tone, the Parson did not notice it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they improve," he said, "I'm sure
I take pains enough with them."</p>

<p>"Do you know," returned the Colonel, "that I was
rather disappointed, on coming here, at finding the
noses of good old Sternhold and Hopkins put out of
joint by Dr. Watts? I was in hopes of hearing once
more sung, line by line, by the whole congregation,
as of old, 'The Lord will come, and he will not;' and
then, as a distinct proposition, puzzling to my infancy,
'Keep silence, but speak out!' "</p>

<p>"If you had come only five years sooner, you
would have had your wish," replied Mr. Bulkley. "I believe
Wensley was the last town that yielded to the
innovation. I withstood it as long as I could; but
the Association<sup>1</sup> would give me no rest till I fell in
with it. But I found it hard work, I assure you."</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>In New England, from the earliest times, the Congregational
ministers within a convenient distance of each other form associations,
which meet at regular intervals.]</p>

<!-- v1 page 90 -->

<p>"What! were the people unwilling to make the
change?" exclaimed the Colonel. "I respect them
for it."</p>

<p>"Loath enough, at first," responded the Parson.
"Most of the old women actually believed that those
were the very strains which King David sang to his
harp, and looked on the change proposed as little
short of blasphemy."</p>

<p>"And how did you manage it?" asked Miss
Allerton.</p>

<p>"Why, to tell you the truth, my dear young
lady," returned the minister, "I found the young
people my best allies. The allurement of a singing-school
for the winter nights and the glories of the
singing gallery on the sabbath, were more than they
could resist: so, by playing off the vanities of the
young against the prejudices of the old, I gradually
brought all round except Deacon Holt. The Deacon
maintained the faith long after all the rest had
given in."</p>

<p>"And how did you overcome him?" inquired
the Colonel.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," pursued the parson. "I knew
that he was as self-willed as one of his own bullocks;
and so I left him until the very last of the opponents
had submitted. Then, supposing he must have
been somewhat mollified by the change of opinion
in the parish, I moved up to the attack myself. I
found the Deacon sitting at his front door one fine
sabbath evening about sundown. The delicious

<!-- v1 page 91 -->

west wind did, to be sure, bring with it an occasional
whiff from his slaughter-house hard by; but
the Deacon liked it none the worse for that. So, by
way of making my approaches regularly, I said,
'An uncommonly fine evening, Deacon.' 'Ya-as,
parson,' he replied; 'the weather is dreadful fine, as
you say. It somehow makes a fellow feel kind o'
nohow. I was just a-saying to Miss (<i>Nov-Anglice</i> for
<i>Mrs.</i>) Holt, it was such-a-most-a-beautiful <i>arternoon</i>,
if it wasn't that it's Sa-a-ba-a-day, I feel just as if
I should like to <i>sla-a-ter suthin!</i>' (slaughter something.)"</p>

<p>The Colonel and I roared at this, of which no print
can give any idea of the perfection of the Parson's
twang. Miss Allerton laughed too, but with some
exclamation of horror at the Deacon's association of
ideas.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Miss Eleanor," expostulated Mr.
Bulkley, "you should allow for an artist's enthusiasm.
<i>I</i> did; and, waiting sympathizingly until it
had exhaled, I thought that now was my time; and
so I broached the subject at once. 'Deacon,' said I,
'I am surprised to find that a man of your piety and
discretion should oppose the substitution of Watts's
for the old version;' and then proceeded to give the
reasons in favor of the one over the other. He
shook his head. 'Parson Bulkley,' said he, 'I'll
tell you what: I've two good reasons why I won't
never agree to it.'&mdash;'May I ask,' said I, 'what they
are?'&mdash;'My first objection is,' said he, 'that Watts

<!-- v1 page 92 -->

isn't an <i>expired</i> man.' 'Watts not an <i>expired</i>
man!' I exclaimed. 'My dear sir, I am astonished
to hear a man of your intelligence say such a
thing. I do assure you that there is nothing more
certain than that he is an <i>expired</i> man.' 'Be you
sartain?' the astonished Deacon asked, somewhat
shaken by my confidence. 'I am not more certain
of my own existence,' I replied; 'it is a perfectly
well-established fact.'&mdash;'Well,' said he, slowly, 'if you
be sartain sure, I s'pose I must give up that <i>pint</i>.' "</p>

<p>We all laughed merrily at this; and the Colonel
said, "And what was the other point, Parson?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I asked the Deacon," he replied;
"and the Deacon said, 'My second <i>pint</i> is,
that there's a word in it that isn't in <i>Scriptur</i>.'&mdash;'Indeed!'
said I; 'that <i>is</i> vital. Pray, what is the word?'&mdash;'PAUSE!'
said the Deacon; 'there's the word <i>pause</i>
in it; and it ain't nowhere in the Bible!' and he
looked triumphantly at me, as if he had cornered me
now.<sup>1</sup> 'My good friend,' I replied, 'I am more
astonished at this objection than at the other. <i>Pause</i>
not in the Bible! Please just reach it to me. Look
here, now (1 Sam. xvii. 37), "The Lord hath delivered
me out of the <i>paw</i> of the lion, and out of the
<i>paw</i> of the bear." The paw of the lion and the
paw of the bear, taken together, make "<i>paws</i>," don't

<!-- v1 page 93 -->

they? How can you say, then, and you so well read
in the Bible, that the word <i>paws</i> isn't in it?' "</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>The non-evangelical reader, if, unfortunately, there are any such,
may need to be informed that Dr. Watts hath divided his longer
psalms and hymns into two or more portions by the interposition of
the word "PAUSE."]</p>

<p>We all shouted with laughter at this new exegesis;
and Miss Eleanor fairly clapped her hands, saying,
"And was the Deacon silenced?"</p>

<p>"Completely," replied Mr. Bulkley. "He has
never been heard to say a word against Dr. Watts
or his psalms from that day to this. My victory was
complete. But this is the first time I ever told the
particulars, and you will see that I have put myself
in your power. It is a secret of the confessional.
But I am not afraid to trust you."</p>

<p>The cloth being removed. Colonel Allerton said,
that, out of regard to Mr. Bulkley's feelings, he
would give the President's health first; but it was
on condition that the King's should be duly honored
afterwards. As the wine was excellent, of
course the minister made no objection to this; only
when the toast was given he slyly improved it as he
drank it, thus: "The King's health&mdash;<i>and amendment!</i>"
And even these, his loyal subjects, in view of
the recent developments consequent on the Queen's
trial, could hardly say that his Majesty was absolutely
beyond the reach of such an aspiration.</p>

<p>Miss Allerton soon withdrew; and as the two gentlemen
began to talk politics earnestly, about which I
cared nothing, I overcame the opposition of my natural
bashfulness, and yielded to the influence of the more
attractive metal in the drawing room,&mdash;or parlor, as
it was called in those days,&mdash;and soon joined her.

<!-- v1 page 94 -->

She made room for me by her window, and, the excellences
and oddities of Mr. Bulkley giving us a
beginning, we soon went off into a brisk conversation.
Perhaps she found that I was not quite such a booby
boy as she might have taken it for granted I was. I
did not waste much of my time at the university, to
be sure, upon the stupid routine laid down by the
authorities; but then I was extremely well read in
many authors not contained in the college course.
The respective merits of Lord Byron and Walter
Scott, the mystery hanging over the Waverley novels,
the relative rank to be assigned to those delightful
fictions, the comparison of our opinions as to our
favorite characters, gave us plenty to say.</p>

<p>We did not always agree, by any means. For
instance, she was a warm admirer of Wordsworth;
whereas I was entirely too bigoted a devotee of the
Byronic school to allow him more than a very small
modicum of merit. I remember that I made her lift
up her hands and eyes by denying that he was the
founder of any school at all, only a duller sort of
Cowper, with Cowper's knack at landscape-painting,
but without his wit. She retorted, however, by
asserting that Byron plagiarized from Wordsworth in
the third canto of "Childe Harold," which I stoutly
denied; declaring, however, that, if he had, Wordsworth
should be forever obliged to him for the honor
done him. This was all said playfully and banteringly
on both sides; and, when the two gentlemen came in
to coffee, we were on the easiest terms imaginable.</p>

<!-- v1 page 95 -->

<p>After coffee, Miss Allerton gave us some music.
In those days people had not grown too fine to like
Tom Moore; and she sung "Oft in the Stilly Night"
and the "Last Rose" with a roundness of voice and
pathos of tone which made the tears roll down Parson
Bulkley's withered cheeks. Moore was as fresh
to him as Byron, and he could not deny his lyric
power. He was never tired of hearing his Melodies
sung even by me, much less by the fair Eleanor.
But as there must be an end of all things, however
pleasant, so the time came in due course when we
had to take our leave. Mr. Bulkley made the move
about eight o'clock. Miss Allerton cordially offered
me her hand at parting, and joined in her father's
hearty and repeated invitation to visit Woodside as
often as I could.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley said, as we went along, that I was a
lucky dog to find such a solace to my exile in that
out-of-the-way place; and, indeed, I was very much
inclined to think that my reverend friend was not
far wrong in his opinion. We talked the day over
merrily as we walked home, where we found Jasper
waiting for us in the study. I went to bed early, and
fell asleep in a confused whirl of ideas and images.
I remember that I could hardly believe that it was
only a week since the scientific session of the Deipnosophoi
had resulted in my finding myself where I
was. It seemed an age since then. I don't see why
it should. Why should my making the acquaintance
of two old gentlemen and one young lady (for I don't

<!-- v1 page 96 -->

believe Jasper had anything to do with it) make that
week seem so long? I am sure it had been a pleasant
one enough. But, as I have said formerly, I am no
metaphysician, and only state facts in psychology,
without pretending to explain them.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">BEING ONE OF ACCIDENTS.</p>

</div>

<p>MY acquaintance with Miss Allerton went on
prosperously from that time forward. The
next Sunday evening, I walked over to Woodside to
call upon its inhabitants after their hospitality, and
was invited to join their riding-party the next afternoon.
This enabled me to redeem my promise to
Major Grimes, that I would improve the first opportunity
that offered of putting the virtues of Turk to
the test of experience. Perhaps I did not feel as
much surprise, after this taste of his quality, at
Colonel Allerton's refusal to come up to the worthy
Major's terms at the time the treaty for the possession
of that valuable animal was pending, as his gallant
proprietor expressed when he gave me the history of
the negotiation. But I forbear to dilate on his personal
qualities. Such a digression would be foreign
to the purpose of this work. If his performance did
not absolutely come up to the promise of the Major,
still I imagine that officer was not the first military
commander whose bulletin was more brilliant than
his campaign. If he did not excel all other steeds in
swiftness, he might be pardoned as a comfortable

<!-- v1 page 98 -->

exception to the celerities of the fast age in which he
lived; though indeed, at that time, it was but just
getting its speed up. If he did stumble a little now
and then, let the biped that hath never done the same
thing, and with less provocation and on a smoother
road, throw the first stone at poor Turk. I remember
him with emotions of tenderness; for he is associated
with the beginning of a memorable acquaintanceship,
and of a succession of charming rides, that lovely
summer, through a country as lovely, in my eyes, as
the summer itself.</p>

<p>Philosophers differ as to the very most advantageous
position in which one can be placed in relation
to a charming young lady on whom one has no specific
objection to making an agreeable impression.
Some think that a walk "by moon or glittering starlight"
is the very best invention that the wit of man
hath ever hit upon; other some, that the corner of
a blazing wood-fire on a winter's evening is indeed
"a coign of vantage," if rightly improved by a judicious
mind. There are who hold that a sleigh-ride
in a clear, cold, crackling, winter's night, is not incapable
of being turned to a good account, with all its
manifold exhilarations and excitations. And there
are not wanting who maintain that a ball-room, with
all its heat, and crush, and bustle,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"When music softens, and when dancing fires,"&mdash;

</div>

<p>furnishes that exact combination of proximity and
isolation, which constitutes the most congenial atmosphere

<!-- v1 page 99 -->

for civilized love to grow in, from the first incipiency
of flirtation to the final desperation of proposal.
There was much to be said in behalf of this theory in
the days before the incursions of barbarian dances had
shaken the institutions of civilized ball-rooms to their
foundations. The country-dances of our ancestors, and
the quadrilles of our own times, were not unfavorable
to the gentle flutterings of the hovering Loves. But
it must be a stout Cupid indeed, of a robust constitution
and a hardy disposition, that can stand up before
the frantic rush of a polka or redowa, and not be
swept away into utter annihilation by the very tempest
and whirlwind of those whisking petticoats.</p>

<p>But it is my notion that a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> ride on horseback,
through lonely lanes and solitary wood-paths,
is not the worst way of being brought into confidential
communications with a lovely young woman.
Sometimes, you know, one cannot avoid guiding her
bridle-hand in some emergent difficulty; and cases
have come to my knowledge in which an enlightened
philanthropy could not be satisfied without supporting
her jimp waist with a sustaining arm in narrow
and perilous passes. A painful and dangerous position
indeed; but then, you must allow, one could not
suffer her to run the risk of falling from her horse.
I wonder the Humane Society does not reward such
heroic risks by the awarding of gold medals to the virtuous
adventurers. Merely plunging into the water
to pull out a stupid boy or blundering man were a
safe and easy feat in the comparison.</p>

<!-- v1 page 100 -->

<p>My Monday's ride with Colonel Allerton and his
daughter was blessed to me in this very form and
manner. Finding that I was a tolerable horseman,
and withal a very modest and discreet youth, the Colonel
proposed to me that I should accompany the
young lady in her rides during the rest of the week,
which, as he had previously informed me, he should
be obliged to pass in Boston.</p>

<p>"And, by the by," said he, in reply to my blushing
acceptance of his proposition,&mdash;"by the by, I
think you had better make use of my Prince here. I fancy
he will carry you better than the beast you have under
you. Isn't that the horse Grimes wanted me to buy?"</p>

<p>"The horse you wanted to buy of him, rather," I
replied, laughing; "for that was the statement the
Major made to me of the case."</p>

<p>"Was it, indeed!" he answered, laughing in his
turn. "I certainly ought to have wanted to buy
him if he had had half the virtues vouched for him by
the Major, and he would have been cheap at twice
the money. But it was he proposed the <i>trade</i>, and
he had the impudence to ask three hundred dollars
for him."</p>

<p>"So I inferred, from what dropped from him afterwards,"
said I. "But your refusal, sir, raised you
many degrees in his estimation. He thinks you a
doctor in the science he esteems the highest of all&mdash;the
science of horse flesh."</p>

<p>"I could hardly help picking up the elements," he
replied, "considering I was for more than twenty

<!-- v1 page 101 -->

years in a cavalry regiment. I do not profess to be
a doctor, or even a master, in the art; but I know
enough to know that such a brute as that is not
worth the half of three hundred dollars."</p>

<p>The next day Colonel Allerton departed for Boston,
and in the afternoon I walked over to Woodside,
and found Miss Eleanor all ready, waiting for me, her
Fairy and her father's Prince pawing the gravel before
the hall door. We were soon in the saddle, and,
as she was perfectly well acquainted with the country
for ten miles round, we were not long in reaching
as sweet a winding and wooded by-road as any country
could furnish. The mania for improvement, so
deeply seated in the character of New England, which,
at the beginning of this century, found its relief in
cutting infinitely extended straight lines of turnpike
roads in every direction over the country, had spared
this remote corner of its domain. Even the road to
Haverford, by which I had journeyed to Wensley,
was the old road, which, avoiding the turnpike, (as
the road itself is invariably called in New England),
meandered about from village to village, according as
the early settlers had arranged the division of the
soil when they first helped themselves to it. And so
the by-roads through which our course lay wound
themselves around the homesteads and outlying fields
of the farmers, or swept by the skirts of their woodlands
(wood-lots they call them there) like Schiller's
river,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Honoring the holy bounds of property."</p>

</div>

<!-- v1 page 102 -->

<p>"Is this ride anything like those you had in
Devonshire, Miss Allerton?" I inquired of my fair
companion, as the road plunged into a depth of wood
thick with brushwood, the branches of the pines
almost making it impassable for two riding abreast, so
broad and long did they stretch themselves. "You
are too civilized there, I take it, to permit such impediments
as these to cross your path."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "England has been inhabited
rather too long to have left many such primitive
scenes as this&mdash;at least in the south, where I have
mostly lived. I never saw that, for instance," she
said, pointing with her riding-whip to the tangled
undergrowth which choked up the passages between
the trunks of the trees,&mdash;"I never saw anything like
that till I came here."</p>

<p>"And you wish it away, as a deformity, I suppose,"
said I.</p>

<p>"No, not as a deformity," she replied; "it is characteristic
of an aboriginal wood, as I suppose this
really is; for, though the ancestors of these trees may
have been cut away once or twice, I fancy it has never
been anything but a forest; and it is picturesque and
beautiful in itself. But I own I long for an opening
now and then under the trees, by which one might
escape from the beaten road, like a damsel or knight
of fairy in quest of adventures."</p>

<p>"We must first find a well-disposed magician, or
benevolent enchantress, to clear our way for us," I
answered; "for I fear that we shall never find the undergrowth

<!-- v1 page 103 -->

cleared away by any Yankee, until the caitiff is
ready to hew down the trees too&mdash;as, indeed, he is but
too well inclined to do. We are but beginning to outgrow
the antipathy which our fathers instilled into us
against trees and Indians. As they grow scarce, we
may grow merciful to the aborigines of both kinds."</p>

<p>Talking thus we rode along; and my companion
entertained me with descriptions of the neighborhood
of Walford Hall, and the differences between those
scenes of ancient civilization and exact culture, and
the rough and half-reclaimed country around us.
Presently she drew rein at a narrow opening into the
forest which the woodcutters might be supposed to
have made for their own occasions.</p>

<p>"Come," said she, "what say you to trying our luck
down that path? Who knows but it may lead us to
some adventure? I know all these roads by heart;
and, if you will back me, I will try and find out a
new one."</p>

<p>"I imagine you will find it a passage, like those
in the Long Story, that leads to nothing," I answered.
"But still, if you are for the trial, I'll not fail you.
Only let me have the honor of leading the van, and
facing the perils of the enterprise first, as becomes a
good knight."</p>

<p>I turned my horse's head for the purpose of preceding
her, and, in the first place, of removing two or
three bars which crossed the entrance; but she was
too quick for me. Giving her mare a smart blow
with her riding-whip, like another Di Vernon she

<!-- v1 page 104 -->

made her leap the low fence, and so secured the lead;
for the pathway was too narrow to admit of my passing
her. Now, though I was a tolerable horseman, as
I have already said, I had had no particular experience
in leaping fences, that being a freedom in which we
are not much indulged in this land of liberty. But
still, like Frank Osbaldistone, I was piqued to show
my horsemanship by such an example, and accordingly
pressed my steed to the point, not without a secret
misgiving that I might find myself performing a
mathematical curve of some unknown description
over his head. It was lucky for me that I was backing
Prince at this critical moment; for I should have
been sorry to put Turk up to such a trial of his mettle.
But Prince took the fence as if he were used to
much greater feats than this, and thought but little of
it. So I followed my fair leader, who shook her golden
curls, which had escaped from under the control of her
riding-cap, and shot me through and through with
her laughing glances as she looked back at me.</p>

<p>She was in the highest spirits, and talked and
laughed in a most bewitching manner. We could not
proceed very rapidly; and, as I followed in her track,
I had an excellent opportunity of admiring her firm,
erect figure, and the admirable manner in which she
sat her horse. Still she often turned her face half
round to me and chatted away in the liveliest way
possible. The absence of mind which I had observed
at my first interview, and of which there had been an
occasional trace at the few times I had seen her since,

<!-- v1 page 105 -->

was entirely gone. The exhilaration of the fine, clear
sky; the delicious air, fragrant with the spicy smell of
the pines, and growing cool as the sun dipped lower
and lower; the excitement of the exercise, joined to
the sense of pleasure which must always, I suppose,
attend an exploring expedition on however minute a
scale,&mdash;all united to make her seem a totally different
creature from what I had imagined her from my previous
observations.</p>

<p>And possibly it might have been that the companionship
of the only young creature she had seen for
so many months helped to unlock her spirits by the
secret magic of youthful sympathy. She must have
discerned that I was a harmless as well as a sheepish
youth, without the least mixture of the lady-killer
in my composition. She could not but know that I
admired her extremely; and in that desert, even the
admiration of a college lad like me was something.
Moreover, I had made no demonstrations of a lovemaking
nature. I was by far too modest for that,
had I had any constitutional tendency to that complaint,
or rather vice. Making love, indeed! A vile
phrase&mdash;as bad as that of "falling in love," which
Yorick justly reprobates as implying that "love is
something <i>beneath</i> a man." No, no! Love is none
of your confounded manufactures. It is an indigenous
growth. You cannot <i>make</i> it. You may tend,
and cherish, and foster it, and sit in its shadow, and
crown yourself with its blossoms, and feast upon its
fruits unto everlasting life; but you can no more

<!-- v1 page 106 -->

make it than you can make a rose bush or a grape
vine.</p>

<p>And now I suppose my readers would like to know
whether this magic growth had sprung up in my
heart and taken possession of me. A very natural
curiosity, I admit, but one which I hardly think it
time yet to satisfy. I fully concede the reciprocal
rights and duties of this confessional, of which these
lines, at which the reader looks and listens to me, may
represent the bars, or lattice; and I shall be ready to
make a clean breast of it in due time. Perhaps I am
not, at this point of my narrative, in a sufficiently
penitential frame of mind. Possibly I am not clear
in my own mind how it was with me at that precise
point of time. You know that my acquaintance with
her was very young, "Ah, yes!" you will reply;
"and so is Dan Cupid very young, too. We all know
from authentic story, if not from our own experience,&mdash;we
all know that he springs to life, all armed, at a
single glance of an eye." I admit the general proposition;
but, then, I have already assured you that she
had not shown the faintest symptom of falling in love
with me. But here you shake your heads with one
consent, and agree that that is nothing to the purpose.
Why, what would become of the whole tribe of novel-writers
and story-tellers if the course of true love ran
smooth all the time? Are they not obliged to cast
about, every mother's son of them, for sticks and
stones to throw into the stream, so as to make it chafe
and murmur the more musically rough in its passage

<!-- v1 page 107 -->

to the tranquil lake of matrimony, which they have
spread out to receive it at last?</p>

<p>This, again, I cannot gainsay. But, then, I have
not told you yet the fatal truth, that I had formed
the decided opinion that she was at least a year, if not
two years, older than I. I positively looked upon her
with a certain sensation of respect for her advanced
years, and, whatever sentiment I entertained for her,
it was qualified by a feeling of reverence for her age.
I thought she must be at least as much as twenty.
And here, once more, you all look arch and knowing,
and ask me if I don't know that a man always falls
in love, for the first time, with a woman older than
himself. You are right again, my friends. Your
observation is founded in the nature of things, and is
just as well as original. But, then, how do you know
<i>that it was the first time?</i> Have I opened to you the
seals of all the books of my whole past history? Did
I tell you who it was that I used to lift off her horse,
when it was on the very tip of my tongue, in narrating
one of the most surprising adventures of this true
history? If you only patiently bide your times, you
will be told all things that are fit and edifying for you
to know.</p>

<p>In this manner we fared onwards, finding it very
often hard enough to keep our saddles, so difficult was
it in places to make our way good through the boughs
interlacing across our pathway. Presently, however,
she called cheerily to me to make haste after her, for
she had come within sight of land. I was soon by

<!-- v1 page 108 -->

her side, and found that our narrow way emptied, so
to speak, into a wide clearing, which showed signs of
having been cultivated at some former time, though
then in a sluggardly condition. Here and there
charred stumps raised themselves above the level of
the field; but they looked as if the rains of many
summers, and the snows of many winters, had been
blanching their grim skeletons since they were first
submitted to the ordeal of fire. But the greater part
of the plain was perfectly cleared, and furnished a
sufficiently hard surface for riding purposes. It was
nearly surrounded by wooded hills, the pine-trees
sloping upwards to the hill-tops, and looking like spectators
in some vast amphitheatre, peering over one
another's heads at the arena in which we were the
sole actors.</p>

<p>"A race! a race!" she exclaimed; and, suiting the
action to the word, she put her mare to her speed, and
I was not slow to do the same good office by Prince.
The horses sprang forward over the turf in the direction
of the only opening in the amphitheatre of hills,
which appeared to be about a quarter of a mile
distant.</p>

<p>My horse was much stronger and heavier than
hers; and in a long run he would, undoubtedly, have
had the advantage. But for a short distance Fairy
was more than a match for him; and, besides, her
mistress was perfectly well acquainted with her ways,
and could command her best speed as I could not well
do the first time I had ever been upon Prince's back.

<!-- v1 page 109 -->

So my companion had fairly the start of me, and was
entering the gap in the hills, which was the goal at
which we aimed, when I had not cleared much more
than two-thirds of the distance. She was hid from
me for an instant by the shape of the ground; and
the next moment I was horror-stricken to hear a sudden
splash and scream from the direction where she
had disappeared. I struck my spurs "up to the rowel
head" into the sides of my horse, who leaped forward
as if intelligent of the distress, and in an instant I
was on the spot from which the cry came. The first
glance showed the nature and occasion of the accident.
The Quasheen, which washed the wood on that side,
was so near the opening at which I had lost sight of
my companion, that, before she could check her speed,
her horse carried her into the middle of the stream,
where, by the suddenness of the shock, she lost her
seat and was plunged into the river.</p>

<p>The stream, though not wide, was deep, and quite
sufficient to drown a stouter person than Miss Allerton.
But, though she had lost her seat, she had not
lost her presence of mind; and she held fast by Fairy's
mane, being well assured that she would bring her
through her peril. I threw myself from my horse,
and was already in the water, when my hopes of
being the preserver of my fair charge were unexpectedly
disappointed. A man suddenly stepped
into the river opposite where she was, (for Fairy
had swum a little way down the stream), and,
seizing Miss Allerton by her floating riding habit,

<!-- v1 page 110 -->

drew her towards him, and then carried her in his
arms to the landing-place whence she had made her
plunge.</p>

<p>Oh, shouldn't I have liked to have killed him at that
moment! And then to be obliged to thank him for
having robbed me of my unquestionable prerogative!
But any such emotions as these were soon put to
flight by the effect which the sight of her rescuer
produced upon Miss Allerton when she had fairly recovered
herself enough to look at him; which was as
soon as he had set her down, dripping like a Naiad,
upon her feet. Clearly all recollection of her recent
danger and of her obligation to the man before her
was lost in stronger emotions. She seemed struck
mute with amazement and to be pale with some yet
stronger passion. It seemed to me that it looked
like fear. The man was obviously a gentleman;
though he was roughly dressed for trout-fishing, in
a coarse sailor's jacket, boots which came up above
his knees, and a weather-beaten, broad-brimmed hat.
His face was as pale as hers, but calm with a calmness
that concealed deep feelings of some sort. In
the surprise and suddenness of the whole thing, I
could not read his features very accurately; but, as
I remembered them afterwards, it seemed to me
that they conveyed a strange expression of exultation
and defiance, with some deeper passion under
all; but I could not make out whether it were love
or hate. I remember I thought it could hardly be
the first. He must have long since survived that

<!-- v1 page 111 -->

passion at the age he had reached. He was, probably,
about five or six and thirty.</p>

<p>As soon as Miss Allerton could command her voice,
she said to him, with a tone in which was mingled
no gratitude for the service he had done her, but only
coldness and aversion, and, as it still seemed to me,
some dash of terror,&mdash;"And so you have followed us
hither, too?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> I have followed hither, and will follow farther
than this, as you might have guessed. But"&mdash;He
paused, and, turning to me, said, "Perhaps this
young gentleman will be good enough to catch your
horse for you, or it may get out of reach down the
stream."</p>

<p>I understood the drift of his suggestion, and looked
at Miss Allerton for instructions.</p>

<p>"Do," said she, inclining her head to me. So I
had nothing left for it but to go and leave them
together, to my most cruel disappointment; for the
adventure seemed to be fast reaching its climax. I
hurried along the bank of the river, sometimes having
to wade in it up to my middle, as the trees often
grew so close to the water's edge that there was no
room to stand on. I had toiled on in this way for
about a quarter of a mile before I came to poor Fairy,
who had not yet found rest for the sole of her foot.
She was just trying to scramble up a steep bank on
the opposite side of the river when I came upon her:
so I had fairly to plunge in, accoutred as I was, to
reach her, and thus was as thoroughly drenched in

<!-- v1 page 112 -->

her service as I had been most desirous of being in
that of her mistress. My only comfort was, that her
mistress seemed as little pleased with the way of her
escape as I could be myself. So, contenting myself
as well as I could with these reflections, I took
Fairy's bridle over my arm and made the best of
my way, like an active personage whose name it
would be improper to name in this presence,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"O'er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,"</p>

</div>

<p>until I found myself at the point from which I had
started.</p>

<p>If I had happened to be in love with the fair
Eleanor, I certainly had no occasion for jealousy in
the relations she seemed to hold with the stranger.
They were so absorbed in what they were saying,
that they did not notice my approach at first; so that
I could not help hearing Miss Allerton say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I owe you no thanks for that. I could have saved
myself without your help; and, if not, God knows
I had rather have died than owe my life to you!"</p>

<p>"You are an ungrateful girl," he replied, with a
smile which made me hate him more than ever. "But
you will behave better by and by, and know that I
am, if you will let me be so, your best friend."
Eleanor made a gesture of impatience. "At least
you know," he resumed, as if provoked, but still
calmly,&mdash;"you know that it is not the first time
I have saved you. It may be," he added, significantly,&mdash;"it
may be, that the time may come when

<!-- v1 page 113 -->

I will <i>not</i>. But here comes your horse," perceiving
me for the first time. "Let me put you on him, and
entreat you to lose no time in getting home."</p>

<p>He advanced towards her; but she turned from
him, and, beckoning to me, invited my assistance to
place her in her soaking saddle. She turned her
horse's head away from him, and took no notice of
the parting salutation he made her. I mounted
Prince, whom the stranger had secured to a tree
after I had gone in search of Fairy, and followed
her, touching my hat to my unknown acquaintance,
which he did not return&mdash;not, however, from incivility,
as I judged, but because he was looking so
earnestly after the lady that he did not see me.
Miss Allerton disappeared first in the wood; and, as
I took a parting look behind, I saw him slowly turn
away and walk towards the bank of the river. But
I imagine his fishing was over for that day.</p>

<p>Miss Allerton and I pursued our way in silence.
As I followed her I could perceive that she was
deeply agitated, and that she was indebted more to
Fairy's instinct than her own care for getting safely
over the narrow and uneven pathway. In one place
it was just wide enough for two persons to ride
abreast. She drew on one side and walked her
horse, as an invitation to me to join her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Osborne," she presently said, in an agitated
voice, "I have a favor to ask of you. It is, that you
will not mention what you have seen to-day to any
one."</p>

<!-- v1 page 114 -->

<p>I readily gave her the assurance she asked for.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell at this moment," she went on,
"how far I may explain to you what you must have
thought so strange&mdash;not stranger, I am sure, than
it has seemed to me. But you shall know all about
it some time or other."</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service to you, my dear Miss
Allerton," said I, "tell me what you think best.
But I do not desire to pry into any of your affairs, as
a mere busybody in other men's matters."</p>

<p>I <i>lied</i> there; for I was dying to know all about
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Osborne," she resumed, in a voice
scarcely audible from agitation, "I am an unhappy
girl, no mother, no sister, no friend, and yet needing
so much the sympathy and help of the wisest
and tenderest friendship!"</p>

<p>She could contain herself no longer, but fairly
burst into tears on Fairy's neck&mdash;on <i>Fairy's</i>, who
seemed perfectly callous to the blessing. Launce's
dog could not have been more insensible to the affliction
of his respectable family. Was there never
another neck near that would serve her turn?</p>

<p>I was a tender-hearted youth at that time, and
the sight of a woman crying was too much for me.
Perhaps I ought to be ashamed to confess that it was
all I could do to keep from bearing her company;
but I am not. I was deeply moved at her distress,
and would have given the world (or as much of it as
usually falls to the share of any one person) to comfort
her.</p>

<!-- v1 page 115 -->

<p>"But, my dear Miss Allerton," I ejaculated,
thinking, like a fool, that I must say something,
"there is your father."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she exclaimed, with a fresh burst of
weeping,&mdash;" yes, dear papa! But, then, he"&mdash;&mdash;she
interrupted herself, and presently added, "I hardly
know what I say, my spirits are so confused by the
surprise of this afternoon. Pardon me if I say nothing;
for I may say what I ought not."</p>

<p>As we were now approaching the high-road, she
evidently made a strong effort to command herself.
She dried her eyes, and, pulling down her veil, proposed
that we should get over the ground as fast as
possible, that we might avoid at once observation and
the ill consequences of our exposures. Though she
said this, I believe she was thinking as little as I of
the watery plight which we were both in. I believed
the strong excitement she was under would prove an
effectual antidote to the wetting she had got; and, as
for mine, I cared nothing for it. I would repeat the
treatment every day for a month in her good company.
We fortunately arrived at Woodside without meeting
any of the Wensleyans; but were received by Jonathan
Snell, when he came to take our horses, with the
most unequivocal marks of astonishment and concern.
And no wonder; for a pair of more thoroughly ducked
fellow-creatures could have seldom come within the
range of his philosophy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Osborne," said Miss Allerton to me when
we alighted, "I insist upon your coming in until

<!-- v1 page 116 -->

Jonathan can put the horse into the gig to take you
home."</p>

<p>I remonstrated; but she persisted. "You need
not fear giving extraordinary trouble; for I must
send him to the village directly, and he can take you
round perfectly well."</p>

<p>This being the case, I yielded to her kindness.
and not the less willingly from the consciousness of
what a figure I should cut in passing the strait by
the bridge, between the post office and the blacksmith's
shop, as well as of the gossip of which I
would be the theme for the next week. So I went
into Colonel Allerton's own room, where his fire was
still kept trimmed and burning, notwithstanding his
absence from home, and gyrated before it like an
animated joint of meat primitively suspended by a
string, with a <i>penchant</i> for roasting. Miss Allerton
retired up stairs, and I saw her no more that day.
When the master of the horse was ready I joined
him, and we set forward for the village. That eminent
officer of the household, of course, was curious
to know the particulars of our adventure; which I
gave him, with no more of the <i>suppressio veri</i> than
the case required. He was not a man of many words,
and he made use of very few on this occasion; but
it was quite clear to my mind, that he thought me a
very incompetent person to have charge of his young
lady. And perhaps he was not far wrong.</p>

<p>When we came to the post office, instead of
driving by, as I had hoped, he drew up at the door,

<!-- v1 page 117 -->

which was watched, as it seemed to me, by a double
corps of observation, which made ample use of its
opportunities as I sat holding the reins. Jonathan,
as he resigned them to my deputed care, took a
letter from his pocket, which I saw at a glance was
carelessly folded and hurriedly written, and directed
to Colonel Allerton. He said Miss Eleanor was
earnest that it should not miss the mail-coach which
would pass through from Pentland on the edge of
the evening of that day.</p>

<p>So she had written to her father an account of
the adventure she had encountered. It was, then,
nothing peculiarly and especially her own. That
was some consolation in my ignorance. What could
be the rights or the wrongs of the matter? I had
no time for protracted speculation, however; for I
was soon deposited at the minister's door, who was
at first alarmed by my appearance, and then diverted
by my story, told, as it had been to Snell, according
to Captain Absolute's directions, with "no more
lies than were absolutely necessary." I thought he
would never be done rallying me on my misadventures
as a Squire of Dames. But I was too full of
what I could not tell him to mind much his comic
commentary on what I could. My boyish sensitiveness
was somehow hardened over since the morning.
I did not mind his fun half so much as I should
have done the day before. Indeed, it was rather a
relief to me.</p>

<!-- v1 page 118 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH ANOTHER CHARACTER APPEARS.</p>

</div>

<p>"OSBORNE," said Mr. Bulkley to me the next
morning, as we sat at breakfast, "do you recollect
who your grandmother was?"</p>

<p>"My grandmother?" I repeated "I suppose I
must have had the usual allowance; but really, sir,
upon my word, I"&mdash;And I shook my head. "But
what is my grandmother, supposing I had one, <i>apropos</i>
to&mdash;to <i>boots?</i>"</p>

<p>"No, no," returned he&mdash;"to something much more
to the purpose than boots. I mean your father's
mother&mdash;was she not a Shuldham?"</p>

<p>"That was the name, I am quite sure; though I
am afraid I should not have been able to recall it of
myself. But what of her, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Much, and to the purpose," he replied. "Your
grandmother Shuldham's mother was a Tindall, daughter
of Lieutenant Governor Tindall, who died in office
in the year 1717, or thereabouts; and his son
Matthew, who was for so many years speaker of the
House, had an only daughter. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I answered, "I cannot deny it, if I
wished to; but how does it concern me?"</p>

<!-- v1 page 119 -->

<p>"Thus," he replied: "that daughter married Judge
John Allerton; and was, consequently, the mother of
the Colonel. D'ye see now, young man?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I answered; "I see that the Allertons
and I are far-away cousins, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Far-away cousins!" he interrupted. "Only four
degrees removed! Do you call that far away?
When I was a young man, sir, I should have called
cousins with a pretty girl like Miss Eleanor, if it were
twice as many."</p>

<p>I laughed, and assured him that I was infinitely
obliged to him for bestowing upon me so charming a
relation, and that I would claim all my cousinly privileges,
even though the claim were as many removes
farther off. And this I subsequently did; and it
gained me one great advantage when my cousinship
was allowed, as it was, with much merriment, as soon
as I communicated to them this result of the good
parson's genealogical studies, in which, indeed, he was
a great proficient. Miss Allerton and I became Cousin
Eleanor and Cousin Frank from that time
forward; an advantage, which if the reader doth not
appreciate, he is unworthy of ever having a pretty
cousin&mdash;an institution the blessings of which should
be confined to those who can properly value them.
But this was not immediately acquired, as it was some
time before I felt that I was intimate enough, or that
Miss Allerton would relish a jocose interlude of this
sort, after the tragic, or at least melodramatic, adventure
of the forest and the river. Indeed, I did not

<!-- v1 page 120 -->

see her for the rest of that week. That plaguy fellow
in the jack-boots, whoever he might be, had
effectually put an end to our rides together for the
time being. I could not tell what influence he might
have upon the fair Eleanor's fortunes; but I was
sure I cursed him by my gods for his sinister interference
with mine.</p>

<p>Colonel Allerton returned before the end of the
week&mdash;recalled, doubtless, by his daughter's letter.
I had called, of course, the day after our adventure
on Miss Allerton to "humbly hope she caught
no cold" from her accident; but Petchell, her maid,
brought me a very kind message, saying that she
should not leave her chamber for a day or two in
consequence of it, after which time she should be
glad to see me. So I had perforce to wait until her
father came back. After his return, I visited at Woodside
as usual, and was even more cordially and kindly
treated than before. Eleanor looked a little paler
than usual, though her roses were usually rather Yorkist
than Lancastrian; but all the more charming from
the new and mysterious interest I felt in her. Nothing
could be kinder than her reception of me when we
first met; and after that meeting, at which her manner
was necessarily a little tinged by a consciousness
of what had passed when we were last together, she
fell back into very much her former way of life and
conversation.</p>

<p>Perhaps a shade more of sadness clouded her serene
beauty, and perhaps her thoughts wandered oftener

<!-- v1 page 121 -->

from the things around her. Perhaps, however, this
was only my imagination; and, at any rate, I had
now no difficulty in accounting for and excusing those
untimely flights from the ignorant present to the past
or the future. What would I not have given to have
been able to look down through those lustrous eyes,
at the soul that looked out of them and saw what was
hidden from my sight, and to have known why it was
disquieted within her! What were the phantoms,
the spectres, that passed before her eyes when they
looked into vacancy?</p>

<p class="small">"Ah, fixed on empty space, why burn<br/>

Her eyes with momentary wildness?<br/>

And wherefore do they then return<br/>

To more than woman's mildness?"</p>

<p>How I longed to protect her, to cherish her, to
drive far away whatever it was that molested and
made her afraid! But I feared that this adventure
was not reserved for me.</p>

<p>After the Colonel's return our rides were resumed,
and Turk once more had the honor of keeping company,
by their grace and favor, with Prince and Fairy.
Occasionally, when her father was occupied, I was
again allowed the privilege of escorting her alone.
But we had no more adventures of the wood and the
stream. Eleanor's passion for exploring seemed satisfied;
and we kept to the highway in as humdrum a
fashion as the most rabid stickler for the proprieties
of life could require. She saw no more, when I was
in company, of the intrusive benefactor of the Quasheen,

<!-- v1 page 122 -->

and she never made any allusion to him or his
works. So I was obliged to solace myself with the
recollection of her promise, that one day I should
know all about him. Indeed, I cannot deny, though
Eleanor proposed no new voyages of discovery, that
I may not have attempted one or two on my own account.
I whipped the Quasheen for trout more than
one Saturday, for miles (though neither the Quasheen
nor the trout suffered much from the flagellation), in
hopes of coming upon that anomalous angler yet
once again. But I saw him not. He was as shy as
the trout themselves.</p>

<p>Afterwards I visited the taverns of the neighboring
towns, and made many a libation of punch and
toddy on the altar of my curiosity; and not wholly
in vain. Captain Pettingell, who kept the Rising
Sun in Bradfield, the next town, thus invoked, told
me, from the oracular recesses of his bar, that a person
answering my description had staid at his place
for a week or ten days; that his name was Smith;
and that he was gone all day with his fishing-tackle,
and sometimes, he added, came back with fish enough
for a week's consumption, and sometimes without
having had a bite. The captain believed him to have
been a Britisher; but, as he paid his way well, and
was a good friend to the house, he overlooked that
error, as well as a way he had of profanely cursing
and swearing (the captain was a professor, and a pillar
of Dr. Babson's church) when anything happened to
go against the grain. And, by the captain's account,

<!-- v1 page 123 -->

he had given his vocabulary in this kind an airing
extraordinary, one night when he came home dripping
wet from having missed his footing, and fallen into
the river. He seemed to have taken this accident,
one surely ordinarily incidental to the gentle craft,
so much to heart that he had retired from the neighborhood
in disgust, and taken the Pentland coach the
next morning for Boston. This was all I got in repayment
of much time and some liquor which I
wasted in this research; and it was not much more
than I had known before.</p>

<p>Matters went on thus for a few weeks, when my
frequent complaints of the inadequacy of Turk to the
exigencies of my case induced Mr. Bulkley to suggest
whether it would not be better for me to have a horse
of my own. This proposition met with my cordial
approbation; and Jasper was forthwith called into
council as to the possibility of carrying it out. As I
had already established myself in his good graces
by my admiration of his master, and my eager attention
to his own personal narrative,&mdash;which I delighted
in extracting from him, and which, to do him
justice, he was ready enough to communicate,&mdash;he
was not long in consenting to advise what he saw
we both wished to be done. He loved a good horse,
he said, and should like to take care of one of Mr.
Frank's if he only had time. This objection Mr.
Bulkley made light of, and I made away with by
offering to pay for the hire of as much outdoor labor
as would make good his outlay in my behalf. This

<!-- v1 page 124 -->

having been made all easy, the next thing was to
obtain the consent of Mr. Moulton, my guardian, to
this investment in horse-flesh. As my application
was backed by the recommendation of Mr. Bulkley,
and supported on the ground of my valuable health,
Mr. Moulton interposed no more opposition than was
essential to vindicate his authority in a matter of this
moment. And his letter containing his assent included,
also, a proposition by no means repugnant to
my own ideas of the fitness of things. He suggested,
as this was a purchase of some importance, and which
it was as well should be entirely to my own mind, that
I should come down to Boston for a week, and assist
at the researches preliminary to its final adjustment.
To this suggestion Mr. Bulkley was pleased to lend a
friendly ear; and with his full consent I intercepted
the Haverford coach the next morning (having, I trust
it is needless to say, walked over to Woodside, where
the transaction excited the interest its importance
deserved, to give notice of my intended absence),
which, in due time, deposited me at Mr. Moulton's
door in Autumn Street.</p>

<p>This gentleman was no ill specimen of his class,
with specific idiosyncrasies of his own. He was descended
of an old New England family, which, however,
had gone to decay for one or two generations.
He found himself, on attaining to man's, or rather
youth's, estate, in a remote country-town, with no
advantages of education but such as the town-school
had afforded him; with no capital but what he carried

<!-- v1 page 125 -->

in his head, and what he had invested in an excellent
character. After various struggles to rise above his
hereditary position in the country, he changed the
scene of action for the city, (or rather the metropolis;
for Boston was a town only, for years after that),
where he buffeted and battled with fortune, with
alternations of failure and success (which, well told,
would be a curious picture of life), until he at length
achieved a place among the foremost merchants of
the nation. It is unnecessary to say that he was a
man of eminent ability; for such is almost necessarily
implied in great success of any kind. The talent
that could build up a great fortune from nothing by
commerce, if it had received another direction, would,
in all likelihood, have achieved eminence on the bench,
or in the Senate, or, perhaps, even in literature.</p>

<p>Mr. Moulton might, possibly, sometimes be caught
tripping in his speech, and his verbs and nominative
cases might not always bear that precise relation to
each other that the more bigoted disciples of Priscian
choose to exact; but the substance of what he said
was good sense, according to the sense of his times,
and most unequivocally to the point. He was not
without his provincialisms and his prejudices. He
verily believed that as Massachusetts politics went, so
would go the country, and, as the country, the world.
He really thought that all the hope of liberal principles
throughout Christendom depended on the fragment
of the New England mind that had accepted for
truth the Unitarian idea. He was benevolent and

<!-- v1 page 126 -->

open-handed to the poor, and would found charities,
and endow professorships; but he would take the
bread out of the mouth of every Democratic lawyer,
minister, doctor, or artisan, if he could, and count it to
himself for righteousness. He gloried in his liberality
of opinion; but he hated and despised a Calvinist in
about equal proportions, and was firmly of the faith
that no good thing could come out of that Nazareth.
His multifarious affairs, and complicated commercial
connections, made him intellectually aware of the fact
that a considerable portion of the civilized world lay
beyond the purlieus of State Street; and probably
arithmetic would have convinced him, had he applied
it to the subject, that a good deal of the mind of
Christendom lay beyond the domain of the Unitarian
denomination; but practically, as far as his walk and
conversation were concerned, the one constituted
the true State and the other the true Church Universal.
But, where his prejudices did not interpose between
his natural goodness of heart and any person or class
that he could benefit, he was liberal, even generous, of
his money, his time, and his influence with others.</p>

<p>I am sure that I have good reason to speak well of
him; for he took excellent care of my estate, and let
me do very much as I liked. And yet he was not
negligent of me either. He had a cordial detestation
of vice in all its shapes, and, without preaching, made
me feel that he looked upon me as incapable of anything
so low and ungentlemanlike. This confidence
was, no doubt, as well judged as it was well intentioned,

<!-- v1 page 127 -->

and, I trust, was not misplaced or unrewarded.
But perhaps the kindest and wisest thing he did for
me was his introducing me to the excellent society
which at that time, as much as any other before or
since, distinguished Boston. To be sure, my connections
with the prominent members of that society
entitled me to be free of it; but it was to the kind
encouragement and good offices of my guardian that
I owed an earlier initiation than my years demanded.
His own children were grown up and married off,
excepting one bachelor son at home; so that he
seemed to feel, and certainly expressed in his conduct,
the sort of partial yet discreet indulgence a
sensible man often shows to his youngest child. All
this, however, is not particularly to the purpose of my
narrative, of which I am by no means the hero; and
I do not know why I should suppose that the public
will care about my own private concerns. But the
image of this worthy gentleman rising up before me
as I looked back at that particular portion of my life,
I felt impelled to jot down the slight pen-and-ink
sketch you see above. And as I hate rewriting anything,
we will let it stand.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came to-day, Frank," said Mr.
Moulton, after the first cordial greetings were passed;
"for I expect a youngster to dine with me not long
from college."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!" I replied. "And who may he be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none of your acquaintances," he answered;
"none of your Yankee collegians, let me tell you.

<!-- v1 page 128 -->

He is from Oxford or Cambridge, one or both; and
I want you to be civil to him."</p>

<p>"An Englishman, then, I take it for granted,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;he is, after a fashion," Mr. Moulton
replied; "that is, he was born in England; but his
father was a refugee Tory,&mdash;James Markham,&mdash;who
raised and commanded a company of riflemen during
the Revolution."</p>

<p>"And what is his business here, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"His business is his pleasure, I guess," returned
Mr. Moulton. "The Bellinghams and Mildmays are
a sort of cousins of his, and he has been renewing
the connection. Anne Shippen [one of his married
daughters] thinks that he is sweet upon Esther
Mildmay."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I rejoined. "And has he been long
enough here for that? I never heard of him
before."</p>

<p>"Why, as to that," he answered, "how long, think
ye, does it take a young fellow to get up a flirtation?
and how long do you suppose it takes for the report
of it to get wind?" looking at me with a quizzical
kind of significance, which made me feel as if a sudden
growth of nettles were springing under favorable
circumstances from the entire surface of my body.
"And as to your not having heard of him before, why,
if a young gentleman's health requires his going into
the country, he mustn't expect to be posted up to the
very last minute. However, he has been here about

<!-- v1 page 129 -->

a fortnight. But much may be done in a fortnight,
Master Frank, I would have you know."</p>

<p>I could not reasonably have denied this proposition
if I had felt disposed to be argumentative,
which I did not. I was wondering whether any
rumor of my frequent visits at Woodside had reached
my guardian's ears; and, if so, whether he had drawn
any inferences from them to the effect that I was in
love with the charming Eleanor. Like most shy
people, I was as proud as Lucifer, and scorned the
idea of being supposed sighing at any lady's feet,
seriously, until it was known that she had consented
to extend her royal hand to place me by her side.
Of course I was never without some princess or
other, whom I served most faithfully till she was
dethroned by some fresher usurper; but nobody
ever regarded these transitory submissions as even looking
towards a permanent allegiance. So I was resolved
to take up my very last flirtation just where I had
left it off two months before, and to prosecute
it with redoubled zeal by way of blinding my Argus.
Whether or not it was the most effectual way, experts
in the art of love must decide according to
their own experience. But I must defer these passages
of mine with Matilda Robinson until I have
more space than I have to spare here. I have in
contemplation the preparation of a work to be entitled
"The Philosophy of Flirtation; its Origin, Uses,
and Tendencies: with Illustrations from the Life."
Should this plan be carried into effect, the reader

<!-- v1 page 130 -->

will there find everything made clear which the stern
necessities of this particular case compel me to leave
under a cloud.</p>

<p>Dinner-time came, and brought Harry Markham
with it. He was three or four years older than I,
and therefore I was the more disposed to like him
when he showed an inclination to be friends with me.
He had taken his bachelor's degree at Oxford a year
or two before with good reputation, and was therefore
a personage of great dignity and high interest
in my sight. I was never tired of cross-examining
him as to the details of university life and discipline
in England; and he had not been so long delivered
from them as not to like to recount them. During
the fortnight of my stay in town (for my week grew
by degrees to that size) we were constant companions.
By day we scoured the country round in
search of points of view (for he was an excellent
draughtsman) and of historical interest. In the
evenings we resorted to the pleasant societies still to
be found even in many town houses, although it was
early in August,&mdash;for the dispersion of the summer
was not then as universal as it has since become,&mdash;or
else we drew rein at some of the villas within ten
miles of the city, where we were sure of a hospitable
entertainment. Pleasant, cheerful, happy hours they
were. And why not? It were hard, indeed, if the
hours between nineteen and three and twenty were not
pleasant, cheerful, and happy&mdash;and those, too,
the hours of a fine August flitting over the face of a

<!-- v1 page 131 -->

lovely country, fit residence, of as lovely inhabitants;
at least, some of them.</p>

<p>I have forgotten to mention, what was not unimportant
to the prosecution of these adventures, that I
had succeeded admirably in accomplishing the object
of my visit to Boston. I had mounted myself to my
entire satisfaction, and in this had derived material
assistance from the skill of my new friend in horse-flesh.
He had not wasted the whole of his time at
the university over Latin and Greek. He had improved
a portion of his hours in more practical
pursuits, among which might be reckoned the occasional
pursuit of foxes and hares; and one result of
these studies was a more than common knowledge of
the noblest of the servants of man. Having thus
secured what I had come down for soon after my
arrival, I thought it advisable to give my new purchase
a full and fair trial before taking him to the
distant solitudes of Wensley: hence these rides of
which I have spoken, and hence the agreeable episodes
I have hinted at in the course of the last paragraph.
So Whitefoot,&mdash;for such was the Homeric
designation we bestowed upon him from the color of
his off forefoot&mdash;Whitefoot and I formed the friendship
which lasted for the rest of his life, under these
pleasant circumstances and in this good company.
To be sure, it took some time to satisfy all my scruples
as to his sufficiency; and we had to make a good
many afternoon and evening excursions, not always
unaccompanied by side-saddles and riding-habits,

<!-- v1 page 132 -->

before he had vindicated to himself his claim to my
entire confidence. But it was erring, if erring it
were, on the side of prudence and discretion&mdash;virtues
which were early developed in my character, and
which I still regard as its chiefest jewels.</p>

<p>I do not know what inference my readers may draw
from this voluntary prolongation of my leave of absence.
Perhaps I ought not to have told of it. It may
not be creditable to me, that I was willing to exchange
the society of Miss Allerton for that of any number
of other beauties. I certainly saw none other so handsome;
but then, you know, safety may lie in other
multitudes than those of counsellors. In fact, although
I do hate inconstancy as much as my Lord
Byron did, and, like him, "loathe, detest, the mortal
made of such quicksilver clay that on his breast no
permanent impression can be made" (I do not remember
the quotation accurately enough to reduce it to
verses), still even the most constant swain will occasionally
make an excursion to gaze on other shepherdesses
than his own, if it were only to glory in her
supremacy over all others.</p>

<p>And perhaps I may have had a lurking idea that
my cousin Eleanor might value her newly-found
relative none the less for a brief interval of absence.
All this on the supposition that she was more to me
than any other pretty woman, which, you are aware,
I have not yet admitted. But story-readers, as well
as story-tellers, are a gossiping generation, and can
seldom see a young man and woman in company together,

<!-- v1 page 133 -->

without putting constructions on what they say
and do, which perhaps it had never entered into their
hearts to conceive. But as my course is a perfectly
straightforward one, with no traps and pitfalls set to
catch the interest of the reader, it is my duty to remove
out of the way all objections that arise as they come
along.</p>

<p>But still, as my fortnight's fast was drawing to an
end, I began to feel a good wholesome appetite for
Wensley again. Not only did I feel the wish growing
strong within me to renew my cousinly relations
with Woodside, but I longed to see the good Parson
once more, and the worthy Jasper, whose sable image
formed, as it were, the shadow of that of his master.
In my talks with Markham I told him all that I have
told you about these characters in my rural drama, and
he expressed a strong wish to be brought face to face
with them. Of course I was not slow in asking him
to come and pay me a visit. Major Grimes's doors,
both of his house and his stable, ever stood open for
the welcome of man and beast, and I could warrant
him a friendly reception from all the rest. He
thanked me, and promised to come at some convenient
season before he left New England on his tour
through the country.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised at his not being more in
a hurry, when I made an accidental discovery in the
course of one of our rides. We were discussing the
comparative claims of two rival beauties, both of whom
we had visited in the course of the afternoon. I do

<!-- v1 page 134 -->

not remember how it came about; but I illustrated
some criticism of mine by a reference to Miss Allerton,
whose superiority over both the ladies in question
I maintained. I averred that, beautiful as they both
were, they had nothing so striking as the effect of
Miss Allerton's upward glance, from the contrast
between her dark flashing eyes and her "fairly fair"
complexion and golden hair.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly unique," I said, "as far as my observation
goes. I have seen nothing like it."</p>

<p>"Not so remarkably so," he replied, quickly, "as
her downward look. Her eyelashes are perfectly
preternatural."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "Then you have seen her?
I had not an idea of that!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he answered, a good deal disconcerted,
for he had evidently committed himself, very much
to his own vexation,&mdash;"why, yes. Have I never
mentioned it to you before?"</p>

<p>"Mentioned it!" I responded. "To be sure you
have not! But where did you meet her? and what
do you think of her? and why have you not been up
to see her?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that," he replied, still somewhat
confused, "I hardly feel myself sufficiently well acquainted
with her to visit her at this distance of time
and place. I met her once or twice in Devonshire,
when reading there during the long vacation, about
three years ago. It was not long before they came to
America, I believe."</p>

<!-- v1 page 135 -->

<p>"But did you not think her splendidly handsome?"
I inquired. "You don't mean to say that you have
many such women in England, do you? Was not she
as uncommon there as here?"</p>

<p>"She was very handsome, certainly," said he, with
more coolness than suited my own ideas. "But her
style is not so rare in England as it is here. Yes,"
he continued, with an air of deliberation, "I think
I may say that I have seen as handsome women as
she."</p>

<p>I did not believe him, and put down his affirmation
to the credit of his John Bullism, which would
not suffer him to admit that anything could be better
in this country than he had left at home.</p>

<p>Having talked over the daughter a little more,
I tried to get him upon the father, and endeavored
to extract from him some further particulars of his history
than I had been able to gather from Mr. Bulkley.
But, if he knew anything about him, he kept his own
counsel; for I got nothing by my cross-examination.
He lived like a gentleman, he said, with nothing
observable or distinguishing about him. He had
himself been brought into contact with him from the
circumstance of his being employed by the British
Government in the dispensation of the bounties of the
Crown to the families of the loyalists. He was the
accredited agent through whom the funds of many of
those that had suffered in the Revolution reached the
beneficiaries, especially those of them who had returned
to America, or settled in the Provinces. He

<!-- v1 page 136 -->

possessed the confidence of the ministers, and was
eminently fitted for this business by his personal
knowledge of almost all those unfortunate exiles,
reaching back, in many cases, to the very time of the
emigration. Markham's own father having belonged
to this same category, he had had some intercourse
with him at the agency in London on his part, and
in consequence of this had received friendly attentions
from him when he came into the neighborhood
of Walford Hall on the occasion above recited. All
this was natural enough, and I could not gainsay a
word of it. Indeed, I believed it was all literally
true; but I was by no means so sure that it was quite
the whole truth. Markham, too, seemed to be entering
into the conspiracy to mystify me about these
people, whose affairs were certainly no business of
mine. But, then, if people attended only to their own
affairs, a stupid world we should have of it.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only share he had in my mystification.
Not long afterwards we were just returning
from a ride, and were proceeding towards the livery
stable which was connected with the Exchange Coffee
House&mdash;at that time the chief hostelry that Boston
boasted&mdash;just as the New York stage-coach drove
up to the door of the hotel. Everybody who visited
Boston at that time will remember that the passage-way
in front of that house of entertainment was very
disproportionately small when compared with its size
and pretensions; so much so, that we were interrupted
in our career by the sweeping round of the four

<!-- v1 page 137 -->

horses, and had to pull up for a moment. But that
moment was sufficient; for just before my eyes, sitting
on the coach-box, was the identical interloper whom
I had last seen emerging like a water god from the
waves of the Quasheen. There could not be a doubt
of it. Though I had seen him but for a moment, the
circumstances of that sight sufficed to stereotype his
looks upon my memory forever. I should have known
him if I had met him on the top of Mount Hecla. He
looked at me from under his shaggy eyebrows (which,
however, did not hinder his being a very well-looking
fellow) as if he had seen me somewhere before. But
I do not think he recognized me, as he probably took
much less notice of me than I did of him.</p>

<p>His scrutiny of my countenance, however, was over,
the moment his eyes glanced at my companion. He
evidently enough recognized him, and derived no
particular satisfaction from the recognition. He was
very clearly a man not to be easily taken aback, and
one that had a tolerable command of his countenance;
but he could not control the expression of surprise
and displeasure that was extorted from him by the
suddenness of the encounter. Markham's face showed
less equivocal marks of dislike, if not of surprise, as
became his younger years and less disciplined facial
muscles. He muttered an indistinct comment on the
occasion which did not reach farther than my ears;
which being the case, and as it involved an adjective
or two which might justly grieve godly ears, I shall
forbear to put it upon permanent record. He on the

<!-- v1 page 138 -->

coach-box made a kind of a motion, of the nature of a
salutation, in the direction of the brim of his hat,
which Markham acknowledged by the faintest perceptible
swaying of his head, and then, turning away,
rode on through the arch that led to the stables.</p>

<p>"That gentleman doesn't seem to be fond of you,
Markham," said I as naturally as I could. "Who
may he be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a countryman of mine," he replied;
"that is, he is my countryman and yours too. He's
a half Yankee as well as myself. We are not over
fond of one another, as you suspect."</p>

<p>"And his name is Smith, is it not?" I put interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Smith!" he answered. "What do you mean by
that? Do you suppose every Englishman is named
Smith?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is a tolerably generic name," I answered;
"but I had a more specific reason for supposing it to
belong to him, for I have been told so by a landlord
of his."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, what do you mean, Osborne?"
he demanded in strong surprise. "Where have you
ever seen him? He surely doesn't pass here by that
name!"</p>

<p>I then stated that I had met this personage, whoever
he might be, in the neighborhood of Wensley,
when fishing, not long before, and that I had accidentally
learned from the landlord where he lodged,
that he rejoiced in the general appellation I had applied

<!-- v1 page 139 -->

to him. Of course I made no mention of my
cousin Eleanor's name in the business, and seemed to
know no more of him than I have just related. Why
shouldn't I have my little mystery, too? And I
rather imagined that he would have given all I
wanted to know in exchange for what I had to tell.
But my lips were sealed, of course, as to all that had
passed between them in my presence. And Markham
had to spell out the mystery, as well as he could,
without my assistance.</p>

<p>"This is very strange!" said Markham, half to
himself. "What could he have been lurking about
there for, under a <i>nom de guerre?</i>" And then, addressing
himself to me, he went on: "The man's
name is Ferguson; and I am almost as much at a loss
as you to account for his changing it without royal
license. But Englishmen have a charter to be odd,
and possibly this is the form which Mr. Ferguson's
oddity takes unto itself. At any rate," he went on,
as if talking to himself again, "we will hope there
are not many Englishmen like him. He's a black
sheep."</p>

<p>He then changed the conversation; and, it being
plain he wished to avoid the subject, I could get no
more satisfaction from him about it. And as this
was the last time we were to be together previous to
my return to Wensley, I had no further opportunity
of recurring to it. At parting, however, he promised
me, of his own accord, that he would certainly beat up

<!-- v1 page 140 -->

my quarters before very long; until which time I
was perforce compelled to adjourn my curiosity. We
parted that night; and the next day Whitefoot carried
me safely to Parson Bulkley's door, at which
we were both of us joyfully received both by master
and man.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">WHICH IS EPISODICAL, BUT PROGRESSIVE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE attentive reader will not, perhaps, be surprised
to hear that the very first event in the
Wensley life of Whitefoot was a visit to Woodside,
which occurred on the afternoon of the very day succeeding
that of his arrival. He was fortunate enough to meet
with the approbation of my cousin Eleanor,
and also, which was perhaps a more important testimony
to his character, with that of my much respected
and more experienced cousin, the Colonel. That gallant
officer made a close and scientific inspection of
his various points with the eye at once of an <i>amateur</i>
and of a <i>connoisseur</i>, and was pleased to pronounce
him very well indeed for a horse bred and broken in
America. This, I was well aware, was as high praise
as an Englishman (for such Colonel Allerton persisted
in considering himself, notwithstanding his New
England birth and parentage) could be expected to
bestow on Bucephalus, or Pegasus himself, were one
or both of those celebrated animals trotted out for his
opinion. So I accepted it as the seal of my bargain,
and felt entitled to brag according to knowledge of
his merits whenever Major Grimes and his party saw
fit to disparage him as an interloping rival of Turk.

<!-- v1 page 142 -->

This interested opposition, however, was confined exclusively
to the Grimes faction, (a pretty large one, by
the way); for the Wensleyans in general, outside of
the charmed circle described by the Major's toddy
stick, were unanimous in giving Whitefoot the pre-eminence
over his Moslem competitor.</p>

<p>And the feeling of triumph was very universal;
for I flatter myself I had become by this time rather
a favorite in the town, though neither my modesty
nor the necessities of my story will allow of my recounting
the whereby and wherefore. I say it caused
a widespread feeling of satisfaction when the last
convincing proof of his excellence was given by Major-General
Boardman, an eminent house-carpenter
(builder he would be called in these euphuistic days)
of Haverford, the capital town of the county, who
did Whitefoot the honor to borrow him for the fall
muster, selecting him out of all the steeds of the shire
as the most worthy to bound beneath his
weight (which was considerable) along the arms-presenting
line and to share with him the dangers and glories of
that important field day. To be sure, Major Grimes
was heard to suggest to some of his faction that "it
wasn't likely Mr. Frank Osborne was going to take
any hire for his beast;" which indeed it was not;
nor yet, I should hope, that an officer of such distinction
should have been influenced by so sordid a
consideration.</p>

<p>It was also unfortunately true that the gallant general
gave occasion for disrespectful language on the

<!-- v1 page 143 -->

part of his subordinate officer, by returning his borrowed
charger with a piece of the skin (technically
called the <i>bark</i>) taken off his near hind leg, occasioned
by backing him against the wheel of a gun-carriage.
This gave the enemy great cause for
triumph; and I was not over well pleased with the
circumstance myself. As for Colonel Allerton, who
had the natural antipathy of a regular for a citizen
soldier, when I told him of the mishap, he was
louder and deeper in the expression of his sense of
the General's stupidity than even I had been. Indeed,
he spoke of it in terms, which, as they might
be neither acceptable nor edifying to the serious
reader, I shall considerately pretermit. Suffice it to
say that they were of a nature, which, had the Colonel
been under the General's command, would have
justly subjected him to be court martialled for "unbecoming
and disrespectful language towards his
superior officer." I, however, regarding the accident
as the fortune of war, to which I was myself in some
good measure accessory by consenting to expose my
white-footed friend to its casualties, possessed my soul
in such patience as I could muster, inly resolving that
he should be exempt from military duty from that
time forward.</p>

<p>I have thrown these particulars together in this
place, although thereby I run before the regular
course of my history, to which I am in general careful
scrupulously to confine myself, in order that the
reader might take in at a glance all the bearings of

<!-- v1 page 144 -->

this important affair, and also that it may be cleared
out of the way, so as not to interfere with those
scenes of intense interest, which, like the rain in the
almanac, may be looked for about this time. We will
now return to the afternoon when I first submitted
my horse to the cousinly inspection above mentioned.
The examination over, and Whitefoot consigned to
the care of Mr. Jonathan Snell, (who was also pleased
to vouchsafe his gracious approval of the same), the
colonel retired to his own room, the same described
in my third chapter as enjoying the brevet rank of
the library, and my cousin Eleanor and I strolled
out to enjoy the exquisite summer afternoon just
melting into evening.</p>

<p>We took our way towards the avenue of elms
which I have already said descended the other side
of the little hill on which the house stood. It was
as sweet a walk as a pair of lovers (had we only
happened to have been such) could have desired.
The avenue led nowhere, to be sure, excepting to a
rough field, not long cleared, which was skirted by
the old wood which gave its name to the place; but
the turf was elastic and velvety, from being kept
closely mown and well rolled in the English fashion;
and the branches, thick with leaves, and alive with
birds, stretched themselves long and wide until they
clasped each other over our head. And after descending
the first sharp though short descent, assisted
by steps cut in the turf, you were hid by a
screen of shrubbery from the house, and might have

<!-- v1 page 145 -->

imagined yourself in Arden or the Black Forest for
any signs of human neighborhood that forced themselves
on your notice.</p>

<p>As we paced up and down this "dry, smooth-shaven
green," my lovely cousin magnetizing me
with the gentle weight of her hand on my arm, we
launched at once into the animated discourse of
friends to the current of whose talk the interposition
of a short absence has given at once a greater fulness
and a swifter flow. She gave me such bits of gossip
as the village had afforded during the two weeks of
my absence, of which Petchell, her maid, who had
established relations with certain of the inhabitants,
was the voucher. Perhaps it was peculiar to this
young lady that she did not dislike to hear tell of the
loves and the bickerings, of the history (private and
public, civil and ecclesiastical) of the little neighborhood
at her door. And why not? Human beings
are human still in such an out-of-the-way nook as
Wensley; and they are no more in the throngs of
Hyde Park or the Boulevards, of St. James's or the
Tuileries. And one who sympathizes with the joys
and sorrows of men and women, and not with the
cost or fashion of their clothes or carriages, who
finds interest in their characters and fates rather
than in their houses and furniture, will find food
enough for sadness and for mirth in more unlikely
spots than the one which my gentle heroine gladdened
by the genial influences of her sweet and
kindly presence.</p>

<!-- v1 page 146 -->

<p>But I was, in virtue of my absence, expected to
be the chief talker; and, accordingly, I retailed
whatever store of news I had collected in Boston,
for her amusement. In those days, the connection
of an inland town, like Wensley, with the capital
of the State, was hardly so intimate as the connection
of that city with the capital of the world is
now, so effectually has steam accomplished that
annihilation of time and space for which the lovers
celebrated in the Bathos prayed. "The Columbian
Centinel" afforded the only loophole through which
the curious inhabitants peeped, twice a week, at the
busy world; and I believe Mr. Bulkley and Colonel
Allerton were the only regular subscribers its hearty
old editor, Major Ben. Russell, had in the town.
The Colonel, to be sure, had the English papers;
but they came at long intervals and with no great
regularity.</p>

<p>I told Miss Eleanor all the private history I had
learned, the engagements, the marriages, the deaths,
the feuds, and the reconciliations, which made up
then, as they do now and ever will, the staple of
our communications about our acquaintances and
friends. Having emptied my budget of everything
I had to tell, excepting the things I was thinking
most about, we sat down on a rustic bench placed
near the head of the avenue, at a point from which
the sunset could be commanded, and remained for a
while silently gazing at the gorgeous clouds, which
the touch of celestial light had transformed from

<!-- v1 page 147 -->

cold masses of vapor into cliffs and billows of gold
and violet, as the eye of genius looks on the commonest
things of earth and they glow as with hues
caught fresh from heaven.</p>

<p>As we sat watching these glorious apparitions together,&mdash;Eleanor,
I am afraid, thinking more of them
than of me, and I, I am sure, thinking more of her
than of them,&mdash;she said, presently, rather to herself
than to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a strange thing that a sight like this, which
happens every day, should never look twice alike
either to the eyes or to the mind. The feelings it
creates, or recalls to the heart, are as varied, though
not always as bright, as the hues it leaves on the
clouds there."</p>

<p>"True, cousin Eleanor," I replied; "but all sunsets
are not brilliant and bright like this. Some
suns go down in clouds and storms, you know, and
darkness comes upon us with no glorious prologue
like that before our eyes."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she answered, "more than of such
as these. The analogy holds good, which poets and
moralists have discerned, and which no one can
help feeling, between the closing scenes of life and
of day. There are few men, as well as few suns,
you remember,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'whom scenes like these await;<br/>

Who sink unclouded in the gulfs of fate.' "</p>

<p>"That is true again," I returned; "but then it
is the very clouds that seek to oppress the sinking

<!-- v1 page 148 -->

sun that make his ending so splendid, when he has
the power to overcome them and make them contribute
to his glory."</p>

<p>"And even where clouds and darkness rest upon
him when he goes to his rest," she resumed, "we
know that he is still the same bright and blessed orb
as when he shone at noonday, and that he will be sure
to return again as beautiful and beneficent as ever."</p>

<p>"We know that of the sun," I replied; "for we
have the experience of hundreds of generations to
the fact. But there, I imagine, the analogy ends.
The dead never return again, be their setting bright
or dark."</p>

<p>Eleanor turned her eyes from the fading sunset
and looked into mine. "Cousin Frank," said she,
"you have thought seriously for so young a man."
(She, you will recollect, I judged to be a matter of a
twelvemonth or so older than I, and, as such, entitled
to talk wisdom to me). "I should think that
your day was bright enough to keep the thought of
its ending out of your mind."</p>

<p>"You forget, Eleanor," I replied, dropping the
usual consanguineous epithet for the first time,&mdash;"you
forget that, though my day may be young,
it has not been without its morning clouds, neither.
It is not altogether a cheerful thing, cousin, to have
neither father nor mother, nor brother nor sister.
Mine have all sunk into the gulfs of Fate you just
spoke of, and left me to live out my day by myself

<!-- v1 page 149 -->

as I may. I was not old enough then to know or to
feel my loss; but I am now to do both."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten, dear cousin Frank," said Eleanor
kindly, in reply; "I confess I had, just then. But
I should not have done so; for I am too nearly in
your condition myself. My father indeed lives; but
he is my only blood relation. And my estate is in one
thing sadder than yours; for <i>I</i> do remember my
mother, and the agony her death caused is still fresh
in my mind. Perhaps, however," she said, with a
sigh, as it were to herself again,&mdash;"perhaps, however,
it saved her from a yet deeper agony, had
she&mdash;&mdash;." And she stopped, as if recollecting herself.</p>

<p>"I do not understand your allusion, of course,
cousin," I replied; "but I do not accept your philosophy.
It is no consolation to me to think my
father and mother are spared from possible or certain
evils. I wish them to be alive and live out their
days, as Nature meant they should. She never meant
that they should leave me, a wailing infant in the
cradle, a burden to friends, or a task to hirelings.
It was my part to have laid their heads in the grave
long years hence, after they had reared, guided,
and taught me in my way of life, which I must
now enter upon alone. No, no, my cousin: life is
a better thing than death, let its circumstances be
what they may; unless, indeed," I added, quite casually,
by way of an exceptive demonstration of a
general proposition,&mdash;"unless, indeed, it be infamy.
Dishonor, indeed"&mdash;</p>

<!-- v1 page 150 -->

<p>I stopped short; for, looking at Eleanor, who was
earnestly listening to me as I spoke, I saw that something
touched her. A sort of spasm seemed to contract
her features; her eyes closed; and she bit her
under lip so suddenly that the blood actually trickled
down her beautiful chin. At the same time she
violently but unconsciously clutched my arm. I was
greatly alarmed, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearest Eleanor, you are very ill. Let me call
Petchell. Let me help you into the house, for God's
sake!"</p>

<p>"No, no," said she, recovering herself, as I spoke.
"I am well again. It was a transient pain; but it is
gone now," opening her eyes, which looked preternaturally
bright, and, contrasting with her pale face
and the trickling crimson from her lip, gave her an
expression which almost frightened me, it was so
unnatural and wild.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, presently,&mdash;"come, let us take
a turn or two. It will make me better."</p>

<p>We rose and walked slowly down the path under
the trees. She leaned heavily on my arm; and after
a single turn, in which she rather tottered than
walked, she said that she must go in; and we approached
the turf steps, which, as I have said before,
assisted the ascent to the house. Eleanor paused for
a moment at the foot; and I, merely to assist her in
mounting them, passed my arm round her waist for
her more effectual support. We were kinsfolk, you
know,&mdash;at least after a sort,&mdash;and common humanity,

<!-- v1 page 151 -->

as well as cousinly affection, made it imperative upon
me to see that she received no detriment while under
my charge. At any rate, as she found no fault with
the arrangement (I am afraid that she never noticed
it), I apprehend that it can be no manner of concern
of yours. Perhaps there was no absolute necessity
of continuing it after the steps had been scaled; but
something must be forgiven to the force of habit (and
some habits do not take long to form); and then it
must be remembered that the ground still sloped
gently upward as you skirted the screen of shrubbery
which divided the avenue from the house.</p>

<p>As we labored rather slowly along this "verdurous
wall," some one suddenly turned the corner, and advanced
towards us. At first I supposed that it must
be her father, and was glad he was coming to my
help. But, when I raised my eyes to his face, to my
great surprise I saw before me Henry Markham,
whom I had parted from at the Exchange Coffee House
only two or three days before. I don't know how it
was; but I was not as glad to see him at that moment
as I would have sworn I should have been to meet
him in Wensley, when we arranged his visiting me
at some time future. It was quite a new revelation
to me that he was on such terms with Eleanor as to
come to see her without some greater show of ceremony.
And, to do him justice, he did not seem to
be much better pleased with the particular grouping
of the figures before him. Perhaps he thought it <i>too</i>
particular. I am sure it was not unpicturesque, and,

<!-- v1 page 152 -->

if he did not like it, why, it was the worse for him.
As for Miss Eleanor, she seemed to be surprised out
of all her late agitation, and stood quite firmly again
in the face of this apparition. The blood rushed into
her cheeks with the pretty effect I have celebrated
when I first introduced her to the reader's acquaintance;
and she had a look out of her eyes at this
young man, which was not altogether well pleasing in
mine. I spoke first.</p>

<p>"Markham," I exclaimed, "you are better than
your word! You are upon me before I have had
time to tell Miss Allerton that you were coming to
Wensley. But you are welcome all the same; and
I am right glad to see you."</p>

<p>I am afraid this assurance must be reduced into
the category of that description of embroidery about
which Mrs. Amelia Opie wrote a story, which was
much in vogue about that time (though, as I remember
them, her white lies, if they were not black ones, well
deserved to be such), as well as the assertion that I
had not had time to tell Eleanor that he was coming.
I think that I might have found time, if I had been
economical of it, to have told her as much as that.
But, for some reason or other, I did not like to tell her
of the approaching advent of so handsome and taking
an Old-World acquaintance of hers. She cast a look,
in which there was a good deal of surprise mingled
with a little displeasure, as I thought, at my reticence,
and then, bowing to Markham, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had heard from papa that Mr. Markham was in

<!-- v1 page 153 -->

the country, but did not expect the pleasure of a
visit from him at Wensley."</p>

<p>"I had no intention of intruding myself upon Miss
Allerton," said Harry, a little discomposed, but a good
deal <i>miffed;</i> "but, missing of my friend Osborne at
the parsonage (with rather a savage look at my right
arm, which was now relieved from its recent duty, and
was supporting hers), I took the liberty of walking
over here to find him, and at the same time to pay
my respects to Colonel and Miss Allerton."</p>

<p>"Papa and I will be always happy to see the
friends of Mr. Osborne," Eleanor returned, rather
stiffly; "and, if you please, we will return into the
house, and I will send for him."</p>

<p>It is barely possible that Markham would have dispensed
with this last attention; but he could not well
refuse it; and so he turned and walked along with us.</p>

<p>"Are you quite well, Miss Allerton?" he presently
inquired. "I am afraid you have met with some
accident just now," looking at the scarlet stain on her
ivory skin. "Have you fallen?"</p>

<p>"A slight accident," she replied, putting her hand
to her lip; "of no consequence at all. A little cold
water will put it all to rights again."</p>

<p>There was no time for further speech; for we were
now in the parlor. Eleanor, after ringing the bell,
and ordering her father to be called, went up stairs
to her dressing-room to wash away the bloody witness
from her face. My curiosity was well aroused,
as may be well supposed, to learn the relations of my

<!-- v1 page 154 -->

new friend and my cousins; but I had no time for
inquiry, as the alert step of the Colonel was heard
approaching at the same time almost that her light
foot was over the other threshold. He entered with
his usual open and cordial face of hospitality, that
ever beamed upon the stranger within his gates. At
the shades of evening were beginning to prevail, he
had actually grasped the hand of Markham before he
saw who he was. When he discerned his visitor's
face, the expression of his own changed as suddenly
as did that of the landscape under the thunder-cloud
to whose good offices I had owed my first introduction
to Woodside. The pressure of his hand was
checked in mid-grasp, and that of his visitor dropped,
after no prolonged salutation. His air was pervaded
with a perfectly courteous but thoroughly frigid tone,
enough I am sure to have turned me into an icicle,
had I been the object of it.</p>

<p>I really pitied poor Markham, though I was not
regarding him just then with absolute complacency.
I saw that more had passed between him and the
Allertons in England than he had chosen to intimate
to me; and I would have given Whitefoot and boot
besides to anybody that could tell me how it all was.
But there was no apparent danger of my being led
into such a rashness. There was no one who could
enlighten me on this side the Atlantic. But stop&mdash;was
there no one? There was Petchell. She must
know all about it. But it would be base and ungentlemanlike
to pry into the secrets of my hospitable

<!-- v1 page 155 -->

cousins in that kind of way. So it would. But, on
the whole, I am rather glad that I had no opportunity
for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> interview with "Machiavel the
waiting maid," about that time.</p>

<p>The salutations over, as above described, Colonel
Allerton waved us to seats, and then took a chair himself.
He first made civil inquiries after Markham's
family; which being satisfied, he then proceeded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did not expect the pleasure of seeing you in
America when we parted in London."</p>

<p>"I did not then anticipate visiting this country,"
said Markham; "but circumstances have made it
seem important to me to come hither, though I
may have over-estimated their urgency."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied the Colonel rather dryly, though
very politely. "I had no idea that Mr. Henry Markham's
affairs were of such pressing moment. I hope
they will arrange themselves to his satisfaction."</p>

<p>"I hope, sir," he returned, "that I shall accomplish
the purpose of my journey; though it was not
undertaken for my own benefit, and I do not expect
either gratitude or reward for what I came to attempt."</p>

<p>"That would be a pity," answered Colonel Allerton,
a little sub-acidulously; "and perhaps it would
have been well to have considered how your services
were likely to be regarded by your clients before you
volunteered them in their cause. Working for others
for nothing, and without their desire, is not the way
to become lord chancellor, Mr. Markham. But, then,

<!-- v1 page 156 -->

I know nothing of the nature of your affairs," he
added, in a courteous tone.</p>

<p>"I do not defend the wisdom of my conduct,"
said Markham, in a tone of deeply mortified feeling;
"but I am sure of its motive; and, as I hope for no
recompense, I hope I may be forgiven if I have been
fool enough to throw away my own time and pains,
looking not for my own again."</p>

<p>"That, sir," replied the Colonel, with cool politeness,
"is a question which you alone can decide, as
you alone know what your plans are. But you will
pardon me if, as an old man, I advise you, a very
young one, to direct your chief attention in affairs to
those with which you are thoroughly acquainted and
in which you have a legitimate call to assist."</p>

<p>Markham was evidently much hurt by the words
and manner of his host, though I could see no reason
why. Of course I knew that more was meant than
met my ear; but that was small comfort to me. He
made no reply except a bow, by no means as easy
and <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> as those I had seen him make in the
drawing-rooms about Boston. But just then Miss
Allerton re-appeared, calm and composed as ever, and
forthwith rang for lights and tea. The conversation
was not very well sustained after this event; the
three others being, apparently, thinking of something
besides what they were saying, and I as busily engaged
in thinking what that something could be. I
was rather too fast in saying that Eleanor's manner
was as calm and composed as ever. It was plain to

<!-- v1 page 157 -->

me, on the close though guarded observation to which
I subjected her, that she was making a strong effort
to appear as if it were. But there was a little tremor
in the hands as she took her cup of tea, and a
careful avoidance of Markham's eye, which soon recovered
courage enough to go in search of hers, which
I saw plainly enough, and which, though it was none
of my business, I did not like at all.</p>

<p>For the first time since I had visited at the Allertons',
and often as I had partaken of the fragrant
decoction of Cathay in their company, the elements of
that most social of meals (some people prefer breakfast,
but I am apt to be sulky then) were dispensed
from a circumambulatory tray, instead of resting on
a solid, steadfast tea-table. It was, in short, what
some opprobriously, but justly, style a <i>lap tea</i>&mdash;an
institution which I detest and execrate. I must confess
to a secret sense of exultation when I have seen
a clumsy boy upset a cup of tea over the glossy silk
of the lady of the house, or drop a slice of bread and
butter&mdash;"and always on the buttered side"&mdash;upon the
puffy pile of her Wilton or Axminster carpet. It
must have been a "lap tea" at which Belinda assisted
on the fatal day of the Rape of the Lock; only
it was before dinner, and was coffee, and not tea. For
what did the sylphs think it necessary to do?</p>

<p class="small">"Straight hover round the fair her airy band:<br/>

Some, as she sipped, the fuming liquor fanned;<br/>

Some o'er her lap their careful plumes displayed,<br/>

Trembling and conscious of the rich brocade."</p>

<!-- v1 page 158 -->

<p>Now, there would have been no such need of this
anxiety if her (I beg pardon, "<i>la reine d'Espagne
n'a point des jambes</i>,")&mdash;if her <i>lap</i> had been safely
ensconced under the mahogany. What wonder, then,
that, while thus engaged, the relentless baron should
have reft the envied tress</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"From the fair head forever and forever."</p>

</div>

<p>I am the more zealous to maintain the integrity of
the tea-table, as an occasional slight fit of the gout
(entirely hereditary) compels me, though so young a
man, to forego prolonged sessions after dinner. But
this is aside from the stately march of my narrative.</p>

<p>I drew one inference from this innovation on the
customs of Woodside; which was, that, though its
character for hospitality was to be maintained, it did
not think it necessary to be cordial. So, after the
tray had made its third and last round, I ordered my
horse, and took my leave. Markham, though he had
come on foot, departed with me, and with no entreaties
to the contrary to resist. The Colonel and
Eleanor bade him good-night very civilly; but they
threw even more than their usual cordiality into their
manners towards me. I was not flattered by it this
time, nor yet was poor Markham; for we both understood
it well enough. He walked alongside me, with
his hand on the saddle (Whitefoot walked remarkably
fast and well), and I accompanied him to Grimes's
door.</p>

<p>He said but little, and I not much more, as it was
impossible to say what I wanted to. He showed

<!-- v1 page 159 -->

no disposition to make me his confidant; and I was
none the nearer plucking out the heart of this
mystery, supposing it had one, than when I first
suspected its existence. Arrived at the Major's, I
resolutely declined Markham's invitation to go in,
and the more earnest if less disinterested urgency
of the host himself to partake of a mug of flip or a
rummer of punch as a safeguard against the night
air. Facing this enemy without either infallible
spell against its perils, I put my horse up to his
speed, his hoofs marking their course by a continuous
line of sparkles, and the bridge returning a
hollow roar, heard far through the village, as he galloped
over it. A very brief time sufficed to bring us
to the parsonage and to Jasper.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast, as I was telling
Mr. Bulkley the particulars of Markham's visit to
Woodside,&mdash;only suppressing, as is usually the case
with most human communications, what was most
characteristically essential to them, and he was listening
eagerly to my narration,&mdash;Jasper entered with a
more important countenance than usual, looking as
if he had something to say too. When I had done
my story, the parson turned to Jasper and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who was that in the wagon I saw you talking
with just now? Anybody to see me?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Jasper; "it was only Jehiel
Abbot, from Jericho, (meaning, not the ancient city
of that name, at which unscrupulous moderns&mdash;why
I know not&mdash;are apt to wish troublesome things and

<!-- v1 page 160 -->

persons; but a remote school district so christened
by common consent). He says there's a scrape up
there, sir."</p>

<p>"Scrape! What scrape? What d'ye mean?" interrogated
the divine.</p>

<p>"Why, he says, sir," answered Jasper, "that old
Captain Hunt swears that his daughter Sukey Ann
shan't marry Jeremiah Adams nohow. And she's
taking on dreadful, he says, sir."</p>

<p>"Not marry Jeremiah!" exclaimed the minister.
"What's the meaning of that? Were not the banns
stuck up in the meeting-house porch last Sabbath?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded Jasper. "I saw the folks
reading 'em; and I looked over Pete Spicer's shoulder,
and they was there, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what's the matter with the Captain?"
inquired his master. "What has Jeremiah
done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir, hasn't Jeremiah," replied the man.
"It's Squire Enoch, his father, that the Captain's mad
with. It's something about the right to drive his
cattle over Hog's Neck down to Rocky Valley to
pasture. The Captain fenced in Hog's Neck into his
nineteen-acre lot; and the squire broke the fence
down, and said he'd as much right to go over the
Neck as the Captain had to go over the road to
meeting."</p>

<p>"Oho," said the parson; "it's the old quarrel
about the right of way over Hog's Neck, is it? The
land on Hog's Neck," he proceeded, addressing himself

<!-- v1 page 161 -->

to me and laughing as he spoke, "is worth about
three cents an acre, and that of Rocky Valley is worth
full three cents less. I thought I had patched up
that trouble a long while ago. So it's broken out
afresh, you say, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Worse than ever, sir," Jasper said. "The Captain
said he'd shoot the Squire if he touched the fence
again; and the Squire told him to fire away, and
pulled it down the next morning. Then the Captain
swore he'd sue him; and the Squire told him to
sue and be"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind that part of it," interrupted the
minister, laughing. "And the upshot of the matter
is, that the match is off between pretty Susey Hunt
and Jerry Adams, is it?"</p>

<p>"So the Captain says, and the Squire too; but
Jehiel says Jerry says he won't stand it, and he'll
marry her whether or no," said Jasper.</p>

<p>"There's a fine fellow!" rejoined the minister,
rubbing his hands complacently; for he took the
interest of a girl in all the marrying and giving in
marriage in Wensley. "He ought to be kicked,
though, if he didn't say so. But I must try and
hinder any breach of discipline if I can. Things
had better be done decently and in order. So the
captain says he'll sue, does he?"</p>

<p>"He swears he will," replied Jasper; "and Jehiel
was to stop at Grimes's and tell the stage to call
round this afternoon, as he's going to Lawyer Pratt,
at Haverford, about it."</p>

<!-- v1 page 162 -->

<p>"Merciful goodness!" exclaimed the minister,
half in jest, but a full half in earnest. "If he has
gone that length, it is time for me to step in, to be
sure. Lawyer Pratt in Wensley! That must be
hindered at any rate. I can have no such wolf as
that among my lambs. Jasper, get my horse ready,
and I'll see after it at once."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better take mine, sir?" said I. "He
will carry you to the field of action the sooner."</p>

<p>"No, no, I thank you," he replied, shaking his
head. "I'll stick to my old friend as long as he
lasts; for I'm afraid I should not stick to your new
one. I served in the infantry, you know, and was
brigade major for only two campaigns. And, by the way,
as you will want to see your friend to-day, I'll
grant you a furlough from actual service for that
time. Bring him to dinner with you if he will
come."</p>

<p>And as soon as he was brought round, the brisk
old man mounted his old horse, as if he had been a
charger smelling the battle afar off, (and perhaps he
did), and shambled away upon him in the direction
of Jericho. His taking the field thus promptly
against the threatened invasion of Lawyer Pratt was,
as I had already learned, only a part of the established
policy of his realm. He seemed to have
erected himself into a high court of justice within
its limits, and for many years had judged without
appeal in the controversies which would sometimes
arise in his parish. Such a thing as a suit at law

<!-- v1 page 163 -->

was unheard of within the memory of the middle-aged
section of the Wensleyans.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that such a state of things
was unpropitious to the prospects of the noble profession
of the law. It was many years since the last
suckling practitioner who had ventured to occupy
the little square office between the grocer's shop and
the meeting-house (built by Mr. Remington, the predecessor
of the Allertons at Woodside, away back in the
last century, literally before the year one)&mdash;it
was many years, I say, since Eliphalet W. Peabody, now
member of Congress for the twenty-ninth district of
Ohio, fled to the western wilderness, as it was then,
from before the face of fate, of starvation, and of
Parson Bulkley. The office had been for more than
a quarter of a century converted (or perverted)
into the primary-school-house of the first district, presided
over in my time by Miss Lucinda Jane Sparhawk
(now Mrs. Judge Wilkinson, of Bytown), who was
not a bad-looking girl either.</p>

<p>But I may as well mention, <i>&agrave; propos</i> to the tender
griefs of Jeremiah and Sukey as recounted by Jasper,
that there was another troubler of the peace than law,
about which the good parson took an active interest
whenever it applied to any of his parishioners; and
that was&mdash;love. Though a bachelor past hope for
many years, he was a great promoter of matrimony.
He had a sharp eye for a love affair; and, when he
approved of the connection, he was an invaluable
auxiliary. Many was the match to which he had

<!-- v1 page 164 -->

smoothed the way, and many was the course of true
love of which he had cleared away the impediments
that hindered it from running smooth. To look at,
he did not seem to be a much properer person to
trust a love tale to than Cato himself. But there
was nothing stoical about him; and this was so well
understood that the young people of the town were
as ready to confide their difficulties in this sort to
him as to any of their contemporaries. They were
sure of a tender and active interest in their affairs
which scarcely ever failed to bring them to a happy
conclusion, if they deserved such an ending.</p>

<p>In short, he was in himself a parliament of love,
as well as a high court of justice, for the domain of
Wensley. And he bore his faculties meekly, as well
as absolutely, so that no one complained of him&mdash;the
very Trajan or Antonine of village despots. I
thought I could observe that he had composed a little
sort of romance in his own mind, of which Eleanor
Allerton and I were chief characters. But I rather
felt than saw it, as he abstained from any demonstrative
interference or intimation of it with the most
scrupulous delicacy. So scrupulous was he, indeed,
that I should have found it hard to get an opportunity
to tell him what our relations to each other
really were. But, if I could, I wonder whether I
should have done it. It is odd what satisfaction we
find in this world of ours, not only in our own delusions
(what should we be without them?), but also
in the delusions of others about us.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH THE CALDRON BEGINS TO SIMMER.</p>

</div>

<p>I SPENT the morning with Markham, as the minister
had supposed I should; and we made such
a <i>reconnaissance</i> of the country as the good grace of
Black Sally accorded to us. She performed her part
of the contract safely and surely, if not with inordinate
velocity, and enabled us to respond to the almost
parental pride with which the Major seemed to boast
of his horses, without more than a simple fracture of
the truth. The Major was, of course, a new study to
Markham, who had only known the obsequious and
deferential landlords of merry England; but he was
of a temperament to adapt himself to any concatenation
of circumstances which might involve him, and
was by no means slack in accepting the platform of
social equality which placed the old-fashioned New
England host on a level with his guest. Markham
was singularly free from the John-Bullism which
makes so many of the progeny of that respectable
sire appear so very much like <i>calves</i> when they find
themselves in a new pasture.</p>

<p>To be sure, he was a parcel Yankee; and his
mother's milk might yet qualify the elements of
which he was kindly mixed. But, as a general thing,

<!-- v1 page 166 -->

your half-breed Englishman is more unpleasantly national
than the full-blooded animals themselves,&mdash;<i>Anglis
ipsis Anglior</i>,&mdash;and appears to take more than
an Englishman's delight in making himself disagreeable.
But Markham was none of this sort. He was
a cosmopolitan gentleman, and carried with him all
over the world that sweetness of temper and sincere
wish to make those with whom he found himself happy
and on good terms with themselves, which was
sure to extract what good there was from whatever
men or manners he lighted on, and at the same time
to make friends and well wishers every where.</p>

<p>Being such as he was, what could have been the
reason of the cold and severely civil treatment he had
met with at Woodside from persons whose characters
and manners seemed to be so eminently like his own?
I could not make it out at all to my satisfaction.
Nor could I well seek satisfaction from Markham
himself, unless he led to the subject and volunteered
the explanation I desiderated; neither of which things
he did during this morning's drive. He was not
quite as chatty as he used to be in our rides round
Boston; and there was a little shade over his features
at first, such as even a passing grief leaves behind it
for a season; but it gradually rose from his countenance
and dispersed itself, as the shadow of a cloud
passes away from the landscape, and he became
cheerful, if not mercurial, as usual, long before we
betook ourselves to the parsonage in accordance with
Mr. Bulkley's invitation.</p>

<!-- v1 page 167 -->

<p>My account of that excellent man had made Markham
intelligently curious to see him; and they came
at once into friendly relations with each other. Their
points of resemblance and of difference equally fitted
them for a close adaptation to one another. Mr.
Bulkley was an old man, and Markham a young one.
The former had lived for near forty years in the
almost eremitic seclusion of Wensley; the latter had
spent in the crowds and turmoil of London all the
years of his life that had not been passed in the differing
but not diverse excitation of a great university.
Both were lovers of learning (Markham had graduated
with high honors) and of queer books. Markham
was vastly more exact in his knowledge of the
mechanism of the ancient languages, and more critical
in all their ornamentation of metres and quantities,
than the imperfect instruction of Mr. Bulkley's youth
had made him. But the latter was quite as fully
master of the spirit of the greater classics as my
younger friend; and he was familiar with a much
wider range of authors more talked of than read, including
the later Platonists and the medi&aelig;val Latinists.
Markham, however, was much better versed in
contemporary literature than Mr. Bulkley pretended
or cared to be&mdash;much better, indeed, than English
university men, wranglers, and medallists, who take
high honors at Oxford or Cambridge, are apt to be
even at this day. Neither of them was a man of surpassing
abilities; but they had both of them made
the most of what they had, and had them always in

<!-- v1 page 168 -->

order for use. And for "human nature's daily food,"
I preferred them to most of the great geniuses I have
encountered in my walk through Vanity Fair; and I
have stumbled, at one time or another, on almost all
of special note within the last quarter of a century.</p>

<p>When we were fairly seated at the table,&mdash;which
Jasper had done his best to set out in honor of the
occasion, though he cast rather an evil eye at Markham
at first, as "the spawn of an old Tory," as he
phrased it with more of emphasis than elegance,&mdash;I
asked Mr. Bulkley as to the success of his campaign
against Jericho.</p>

<p>"Why, I found it shut up almost as strait as
Jericho of old," said he; "but I think the walls
will fall down by the time I have compassed it once
or twice more and blown a blast or two on my
ram's horn."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I put in, "and Jasper and I will
shout in your cause; for we are all the people you
have to help you, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Pray, make me free of your tribe," said Markham,
whom I had possessed of the facts of the
case.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," answered the parson; "but
I hope you will only have to shout for my victory,
and not in my help. I think I have nearly arranged
it."</p>

<p>"And how does it stand, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," he replied. "I found it all as
Jasper told us. Squire Adams and Captain Hunt

<!-- v1 page 169 -->

were in high feud, and poor Sue in great affliction,
and Jeremiah in a towering passion, and all about a
right of way over nothing to nowhere; for that is
about the exact value of the matters in dispute."</p>

<p>"Did you tell them so, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no, indeed!" he answered. "I made
much of it, you may be sure. To make short work
of the story, I at last prevailed on Hunt to postpone
his visit to Lawyer Pratt, agreeing to get the opinion
of Boston counsel as to the right of way over Hog's
Neck. And I afterwards got Adams to agree that,
if the opinion were against himself, he would give
the Rocky Valley pastures to Jeremiah on his marriage
to Sukey, if Hunt would concede the right of
way to him. So I imagine I shall settle the quarrel
without promoting a lawsuit and without damaging
a lovesuit. And I am now quite ready for my
dinner."</p>

<p>"I am sure you have deserved it, sir," said Markham;
"but, if there were many such clergymen as
you, I am afraid it would go hard with us lawyers."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, my young friend," returned the
parson; "there is little danger of the gospel prevailing
against the law in your day. The juice of Mother
Eve's apple is not worked out of the veins of her
children quite yet. And that puts me in mind,
Jasper, that you have not brought up the bottled
cider."</p>

<p>This oversight was speedily remedied; and frothing
cups, such as Phillips, the bard of cider, might

<!-- v1 page 170 -->

have sung, crowned the board. This beverage, of
which both the parson and Jasper were justly proud,
as the production of their own orchard and mill, was
made from a receipt given to Lieutenant Bulkley by
Major Sir John Knatchbull, a baronet of the cider
county of Gloucestershire, when he was a prisoner on
parole after Burgoyne's surrender. It was produced
only on rare occasions,&mdash;such as a visit from an
Oxonian, who was also the son of an old-world friend from
whom he had been separated for such long years by
politics and the ocean. A moderate glass of very
excellent Madeira, the gift of Lieutenant-Governor
Bromfield years ago, concluded the repast. The Parson
then lighted his pipe, and Markham and I our
cigars; and a fine afternoon of talk we had of it.
But that must be passed by in silence; as there is
a limit at which a story, like patience, ceases to be a
virtue. Before we separated, which was not till
after tea and well into the evening, Mr. Bulkley
informed us that he should go to Boston the next
morning.</p>

<p>"I meant to go the next day," said he, "to see
about Dr. Felch's council of dismission; but I prefer
putting myself out of my way a little to break this
Hog's Neck, inasmuch as they both are a trifle
ashamed of giving me the trouble I am to have; and
I am confident it will clinch the matter. I think
Mr. Hayley must give an opinion which will answer
my purpose; and, which is better; he'll ask nothing
for it."</p>

<!-- v1 page 171 -->

<p>Markham, hearing this, declared that he would
avail himself of the chance of his company back to
town, as he had accomplished his visit to me. I remonstrated
against this determination, in which the
minister joined me; though, as he said, he was arguing
against himself. Markham was firm, however;
and the next morning, accordingly, he was in the
coach when it came round to the parsonage; and it
whirled them both off together, after brief time for
leave-taking&mdash;Parson Bulkley declaring that if the
proverb were true, that "good company was as good
as a coach," certainly good company and a coach too
were better still.</p>

<p>Left thus alone, with only the company of Tacitus
and Euripides (I do not mention Jasper, as he was
engaged in composing some practical Bucolic or
Georgic in the fields) to console me, the judicious
reader will not be surprised to hear that, after wrestling
for a season with these ancient worthies, I closed
their "ponderous and marble (covered) jaws" which
they had expanded for my torment, and thought that
a walk to Woodside would be no more than a proper
reward of my diligence. As I passed directly by the
post office in my way thither, I of course looked in to
see what was the state of my correspondence. The
cross old postmaster, who had held the office since its
erection, under Washington, handed me a thick letter,
telling me gruffly that there was only a cent to pay,
as it was a drop letter, or one put into the office at
the town&mdash;the only one, he went on to say, in a

<!-- v1 page 172 -->

tone of injured innocence, that had been put in for
more than a year. He guessed it was a love-letter.</p>

<p>As I had no reason that I knew of, for sharing in
this conjecture, I opened the envelope as I went
along, and, to my surprise, found that it contained a
letter addressed to Ann Petchell, my cousin Eleanor's
<i>femme de chambre</i>. A few lines were written inside
the envelope, asking me to do the writer the favor to
deliver the enclosure to Ann Petchell herself, as it
was a matter of importance to her, but without signature,
and in a hand that I did not know. I could not
imagine what it meant; and concluded at last that old
Kimball, the postmaster, was probably not far wrong,
and that the document must be neither more nor less
than a love-letter. I was not over well pleased with
being made thus the go-between of a waiting maid,
and marvelled at the impudence of her correspondent.
And it occurred to me further, that if Miss Petchell
were involved in an amorous correspondence, such as
I supposed this to be, she was not altogether what
Eleanor took her for, and perhaps not precisely the
person she would choose to have about her if she
knew the fact. So I determined that I would let
her or her father know the circumstance before I
performed my part of Mercury to Petchell.</p>

<p>I had an opportunity speedily afforded me; for, as
I was approaching the gate, which admitted you into
the grounds from the high road, I met Colonel
Allerton, who was coming down the road from the
opposite direction. We turned into the sweep

<!-- v1 page 173 -->

together, and, as we walked along the hard gravel, he
said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see you have an unopened letter in your hand.
Do not refrain from reading it on my account. You
are at the happy age when a letter is a pleasure.
Don't delay yours."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you, sir," I answered,
laughing; "and I should like particularly well to
read this particular letter. But, unluckily, it does
not belong to me."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he replied. "Is it for me, or Eleanor?"
holding out his hand for it.</p>

<p>"It is for one of your family, sir," said I; "but
for neither you nor my cousin Eleanor. It is for
Miss Ann Petchell." And I told him the odd way
in which it came into my possession.</p>

<p>"Let me see it, if you please," said he. "I see no
reason why you should be troubled with her letters.
This is odd," he went on to himself, closely scrutinizing
the handwriting; "this is very odd, indeed.
What can it mean?"</p>

<p>We were now at the door; and we forthwith proceeded
to his library, where we found Eleanor seated
by her father's fire, which a little chilliness and dampness,
incident to our hottest summers, made by no
means unsatisfactory. While we were exchanging salutations
and inquiries the Colonel rang the bell, which
was answered by Mrs. Warner, the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Send Petchell here directly," said he. "I wish to
see her."</p>

<!-- v1 page 174 -->

<p>"Petchell!" said Eleanor, looking at him and
then at me in surprise. "Petchell!"</p>

<p>But there was no time for explanation; for the
door opened, and that handmaiden entered, courtesyingly
and simperingly; but still with a look of some
alarm on her features at being so suddenly sent for
by the Colonel, who, though a kind and considerate
master, was a strict martinet in his family, and the
whole <i>corps domestique</i> held him in reverential awe.</p>

<p>"Petchell, here's a letter for you," said he, abruptly,
holding it out to her.</p>

<p>She courtesied as she took it, with a glance first at
the letter and then at her young lady, and was about
to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Stop, if you please," said the Colonel, in an authoritative
tone; "if you have no objection, I wish
you to open and read the letter here. I wish to
know, if it be not a secret, how you come to be receiving
letters from Mr. Ferguson, and why they
should come under cover to Mr. Osborne."</p>

<p>Eleanor, on hearing this, gave me a half-reproachful
glance, which made me fear that I had made some
terrible blunder, though I could not divine what; and
Petchell looked as if she should like to tear my eyes
out. However, there was no help for her; so she
hastened to open the letter with what show of indifference
she could muster. Her fingers trembled,
however, in the agitation she obviously felt; and,
before she could prevent it, a letter dropped out of
her enclosure and fell on the floor. Colonel Allerton,

<!-- v1 page 175 -->

with the activity of six-and-twenty, instantly picked
it up, and, after glancing at the direction, said to
Petchell,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is enough. It is all I want of you at
present. You may go now."</p>

<p>And she went, apparently nothing loath.</p>

<p>Turning then to Eleanor, he said, handing her the
letter, "I did not expect to find you in correspondence
with Ferguson, I must confess. And I am still
more at a loss to conceive why it should be carried
on clandestinely. You did not use to be on such
terms with him."</p>

<p>"It is all on his side, papa, now," said Eleanor,
paler than ever, but evidently in strong perturbation;
"I assure you it is. I have no wish to be on any
terms at all with him. Whatever communications
he has had with me he has intruded upon me against
my will."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he replied, "that you will still persist
in thinking so ill of him. But I cannot imagine
why he should annoy you, after what has passed, as
you say he has, and still less why he should take this
indirect way of doing it. It is not like him."</p>

<p>"Not like him! Oh papa!" exclaimed Eleanor,
lifting up her hands with an expression of impatience
and vexation.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied her father. "He was
always open and candid in his intercourse with us
at home; and we are certainly under great obligations
to him."</p>

<!-- v1 page 176 -->

<p>Eleanor made a deprecating gesture of dissent.</p>

<p>"Why," he went on, "you know he told us of
the blundering folly of"&mdash;&mdash; he stopped, with a
glance at me, and then went on without mentioning
any name&mdash;"and did his best to counteract it."</p>

<p>I thought that it was about time for me to make a
move to retire; as this seemed to be a scene, however
interesting, which had better have only the
actors for audience. But Eleanor went on without
minding me.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we were too hasty in believing him.
I thought better, or not so ill, of him at that time;
but I would not have believed his story then, had it
not been made likely by the circumstances he
brought to our knowledge."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, my dear," said the Colonel, very politely,
but a trifle provokingly, "you would have been
less incredulous had the offender been any one
besides Mr. Markham."</p>

<p>If blood was ever eloquent, as we are told it
sometimes is, that in Eleanor's cheeks made a very
fine speech on this occasion, and one that gave me
an odd sensation, which I had never felt before, nor
have I since, at least in the same degree. She paused
a moment, and then said, very quietly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think, papa, it would have made no difference.
You certainly know that it did not, as it was."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my love," replied her father,
caressing her head with his hand. "I was wrong in
saying what I did. But you know it provokes me to

<!-- v1 page 177 -->

have you so unjust to Ferguson. He could have
none but friendly motives in coming to this country
at this time; for his own affairs might have waited a
year or two. But he came now that he might be of
service possibly to us. And this after what had
passed between you."</p>

<p>Eleanor shook her head, as if she received none
of this doctrine. The Colonel went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But how long have you known that he was in
America? Knowing your feelings towards him, I
did not think it necessary to say anything about
it to you."</p>

<p>"I imagine," she replied, "that I knew of it
nearly as soon as you, if not sooner. I have known
it these six months."</p>

<p>"These six months!" exclaimed her father; "and
never mentioned it to me! That is strange. But
have you ever seen him?"</p>

<p>"Only once," she answered, looking at me. "It
was the day that I sent you word of my getting
into the river. I meant that it should bring you
home; and I did intend to tell you that it was he
that helped me out. But I changed my mind, and
cousin Frank here had to bear all the credit of it."</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive why you should have concealed
this from me," he replied, in a tone of some
displeasure. "I am not too proud to be grateful
for a good office, if you are."</p>

<p>"I could well have dispensed with the service,"
she replied; "for cousin Frank here can tell you

<!-- v1 page 178 -->

that the danger was nothing, and that, if it had been
anything, he was sufficient to the emergency."</p>

<p>I cordially confirmed her statement in its entirety;
for I well remembered wishing the fishing boots
at a considerable distance and in a much warmer
place than the Quasheen&mdash;though that was not
very cold that afternoon.</p>

<p>"You see, sir." she proceeded, "that there was no
great call for gratitude in the case; and I certainly
felt none whatever."</p>

<p>"Eleanor, Eleanor," he repeated, "I do not understand
you. You are a changed creature. I cannot
make you out this morning."</p>

<p>He rose from the sofa where he was sitting and
took a turn or two up and down the room. Then,
stopping short before her chair, he said, somewhat
sternly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And perhaps you intend to keep me equally in
the dark as to the nature of your communications
with him. I suppose they must have related to my
affairs. They were not likely to have been anything
improper for me to know," with a suspicion of a
frown on his brow; "but I do not wish to intrude
myself into your confidence, nor into that of Mr.
Ferguson."</p>

<p>"Dear papa," said Eleanor, earnestly, "do not reproach
me so. What real secret can I ever have
from you? I may have done wrong in not telling
you all about it at once; but I thought I was sparing
you from pain, perhaps from danger, by saying

<!-- v1 page 179 -->

nothing for the present. Indeed, I meant to tell
you all in time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear," he answered kindly, for,
though quick of temper, he was the most placable
of men, "I dare say you can explain it all. I have
never thought you wrong yet, and I shall be slow
to begin now."</p>

<p>The explanation I understood to be adjourned
only till I was out of the way; and I was accordingly
about to make another demonstration of departure,
when Colonel Allerton said, before I could rise,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Eleanor, you have not read yet the letter
of which Osborne here was the courier. I dare say
it has nothing in it which he may not see. He
ought certainly to be paid postman's wages; and
perhaps he will be content to take it out in kind.
Had you not better see what it says?"</p>

<p>Eleanor looked up suddenly from the carpet at
which she had been gazing, and, glancing first at
her father, and next at me, and last of all at the
letter, which had lain in her lap all this while, she
took it up and opened it. After running her eye
over it she handed it to her father, who read it out,
to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is essential that I should have the interview
with you I have so long solicited. It cannot be delayed,
and it must be had. I have that to say which
is of vital importance to you, and&mdash;if it be of greater
weight with you&mdash;to your father. Time presses with
me; and the interview I solicit must be at noon this

<!-- v1 page 180 -->

day, or not at all. I will be at the Sachem's Seat at
precisely twelve. If you object to coming alone, you
can bring your maid with you, or the lad (<i>lad</i> indeed!)
I saw with you when we met, who I understand is
your cousin&mdash;if he be discreet."</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive," said the Colonel, studying
the note closely, as if to extract its hidden meaning,
"what Ferguson can have to say to you about me
or yourself that he might not just as well certainly
say to me in person. However, my dear, I should
not be afraid to make you my plenipotentiary; and
I think he would not make this request without
some reasonable motive. So you had better get your
bonnet, and take Frank's arm, since he is permitted
to share in this mystery, and make haste;
for," he added, looking at his watch, "it wants but
a quarter to the trysting hour."</p>

<p>While Eleanor was gone for this purpose, he went
on to me: "So you have seen Mr. Ferguson, it seems."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I answered. "I saw him for a
moment on the afternoon when he drew my cousin out
of the water, as she has told you. Indeed," I added, recollecting
myself, "I did see him for a literal moment,
when I was in Boston, on the top of the New York
coach."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he replied; "I knew he had been at
the South. I did not know he had returned until
this morning. Did not you think him a handsome
young fellow?"</p>

<p>Handsome! I thought him as ugly a monster

<!-- v1 page 181 -->

as I had ever seen. And young! Why, the wretch
could not have been less than five and thirty. But
seventy and nineteen have different eyes for such
things. I did not trust myself to speak, and only
made a bow oracularly enigmatical. He went on,
without waiting for further answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may have inferred from what has passed this
morning that there have been some former dealings
between him and us. Indeed, I may say to you in
confidence, as one of the family (I made a bow here
of unequivocal gratitude), that he was an old admirer
of hers (old enough, I parenthesized to myself) in
England. Had she liked him, I should have been
well pleased; for I did. But, as she did not, there
was nothing to be said. She has a rooted dislike
to him, apparently, which I cannot understand; but,
right or wrong, it is something to be considered in
the matter of marriage."</p>

<p>"I must say, sir," I put in, "that it seems to me
that my cousin Eleanor is the last person in the
world to form an unreasonable prejudice. She is
candor and sweetness personified."</p>

<p>"She is a good girl, sir, a good girl," he resumed;
"but the best of them take the bit between their
teeth sometimes. And then there's nothing to be
done but to give them their head. If they're good
blood, they'll bring up safe enough when they've
had their fling. But here she comes; and it is high
time you were off."</p>

<p>We accordingly passed out at what Lord Castlereagh

<!-- v1 page 182 -->

might have called "the back-front" door,
which let us out in the direction of the avenue
celebrated in the last chapter. We paced again
down the length of the walk, and then left it by
a path through a belt of trees skirting round the
clearing, which connected it with the aboriginal forest,
or what remained of it. At no great distance
within the wood, but still far enough to be out of
the reach of interruption or eavesdropping, was a
small opening of less than a quarter of an acre in
extent, either natural or of a very old formation, as
there was no trace of stumps or roots among the
short, soft grass. It was believed to have been
made by the Indians; and a large stone, which had
something the look of having been rudely shaped
into a sort of chair, was called the Sachem's Seat.</p>

<p>Tradition said that this was the sacred stone on
which the great King Miantowusett, so formidable to
the Puritans before King Philip's days, used to sit
and rule his tribe. I can only say that, if he were of
like passions with other men, his majesty must, like
many another sovereign, have sat uneasily upon his
throne. Eleanor said nothing to me during our walk.
To be sure, it was soon over; for we walked fast.
But she seemed to be absorbed in the anticipation of
what was before her; and the only sign she gave of
being conscious of my presence was the way in which
she rather grasped than leaned on my arm, as if it
were done rather to steady her mind than to support
her steps.</p>

<!-- v1 page 183 -->

<p>When we entered the cleared space we found
Ferguson walking up and down its narrow diameter,
holding his watch in his hand. When he saw us he
returned it to his pocket and saluted us, or rather
Eleanor, with a politeness which was rather punctilious
than easy. She made as slight an acknowledgment
of his bow as could be and be any at all; while
I unglued my hat from my head just as much
as I thought my share of his courtesy demanded.
Eleanor dropped my arm, and, advancing by herself,
sat down upon the Seat of the Sachem as Portia
might have assumed the judgment seat had it been
hers of right.</p>

<p>I admired the spirit and grace of the movement,
while I thought I understood its motive. She was
resolved, at all events, to have the firm support of
this seat before she suffered herself to be subjected to
the agitation or provocation of what this man had to
say. I dropped modestly back towards the alley by
which we had come in, and left the stage to the two
performers. Ferguson took a stride or two more on
the greensward; while Eleanor said, as calmly and
coldly as if a statue had spoken,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am here, sir. What may your pleasure be with
me?"</p>

<p>"My pleasure is," said he, pausing in his walk and
turning towards her,&mdash;"my pleasure is to do you
good, if you will let me."</p>

<p>She answered only by the haughtiest inclination of
her head, which spoke more of scorn than of gratitude.</p>

<!-- v1 page 184 -->

<p>"You think, perhaps," he went on, eying her with
no amiable expression of face,&mdash;"you think, perhaps,
madam, that I offer more than I can perform, when I
say I wish to do you good."</p>

<p>"If I can put any faith in the letters with which
you have annoyed me for so long," she replied, "I
must suppose that you can do me some hurt, though
you have not been pleased as yet to indicate how or
why."</p>

<p>"And if that be true," he returned, "even in the
offensive sense in which you choose to take my wish
to serve you, is not the refraining from doing a hurt
sometimes a positive good?"</p>

<p>"I did not come here, sir," she replied, "to enter
into any discussion with you, or to hold any conversation
not essential to the business, whatever it may
be, which has made you call me to this place. If
you have anything to say to any purpose I will listen
to you; otherwise I will return as I came."</p>

<p>"Eleanor&mdash;Miss Allerton," he went on, after a
pause, in a softened tone, "you know that I have
had but one motive in following you to America&mdash;but
one in seeking you here. I do not pretend to
the romantic folly of seeking your happiness apart
from mine. I hope to deserve my own by securing
yours. Is there no service that can purchase hope?
I ask no more as yet."</p>

<p>"I thought, sir," she replied with a coldness which
might have frozen quicksilver,&mdash;"I thought, sir, that
all this was at an end long ago. If I have ever done

<!-- v1 page 185 -->

anything to make you think that fresh importunity
would make me think better of what I said when we
parted in England, it has been my misfortune, and
not my design. I never give hopes, sir, which I do
not mean to fulfil."</p>

<p>She made a motion as if about to rise and retire;
but Ferguson made a restraining gesture and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have, indeed, done nothing to give me heart;
but perhaps others have. Circumstances may have
happened which may alter even your resolution.
Your father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My father!" she interrupted. "You do not presume
to say that you sought this interview with his
knowledge?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed," he replied; "he knows nothing of
it. I did not choose he should at present, or I should
not have communicated secretly with you as I have
done. You know he would have made me welcome
to his house, if I had seen fit to come openly."</p>

<p>She bowed an unwilling sort of assent and said,
"What of him, then, sir?"</p>

<p>"He is a gentleman of a distinguished position, of
an honorable name, of unblemished honor, of a large
estate."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Eleanor, somewhat anxiously,
"what of it? I believe none of these things have
ever been disputed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he answered, fixing his eye, which
was generally looking down, on hers, as if by an
effort. "Certainly not. But you know that there

<!-- v1 page 186 -->

have been men as happy as he in all these particulars
who have lost them all."</p>

<p>"No doubt there have been many," said Eleanor,
suppressing an intense interest as well as she might.
"But what is that to me or to my father?"</p>

<p>"Suppose his entire estate in England were lost
and confiscated."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Eleanor, growing almost breathless
as he proceeded.</p>

<p>"Suppose his honor were blasted, his place among
men obliterated, and his name infamous."</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"Suppose him condemned to drag out his life in
poverty and disgrace, an exile from his country, from
which he is shut out by the absolute certainty, if he
returned, of dying the death of <i>a forger?</i>"</p>

<p>"Well!" in a low voice, and pale as ashes.</p>

<p>"And then suppose one, who can bring all this
down upon the father, lays his power at the daughter's
feet, and seeks, as his chiefest good, to identify
himself with the life, honor, and prosperity of the
one, and to devote himself to the happiness of the
other."</p>

<p>"And this was what you have been hinting to me
through the letters you have forced upon me," said
Eleanor, her color returning and her eyes kindling
with some strong emotion or other.</p>

<p>"Precisely this," he answered; "though I was not
prepared till now&mdash;I did not see fit&mdash;to tell you
the exact truth."</p>

<!-- v1 page 187 -->

<p>"The exact truth!" she exclaimed, in a tone of the
most derisive unbelief. "Had you told me all this
at first, you would have spared me some anxious fears
which your black suggestions conjured up. I thank
you for relieving me of them all."</p>

<p>And she rose with a deal of scorn looking beautiful
"in the contempt and anger of her lip," and was moving
towards me, when Ferguson laid a detaining hand
upon her arm, which she shook off as if it had been
some crawling reptile.</p>

<p>"Stay a moment," said he. "I do not blame you
for rejecting what I say at the first hearing. It would
be strange indeed if you did not. But do you suppose
I would commit myself in this way if I had not
facts and evidence behind me? I do not ask for my
reward till I have established my claim by indisputable
proof of the service."</p>

<p>"Service! reward! facts!" ejaculated Eleanor, as if
she could not quite put her thoughts in order. But
presently she said, very collectedly, "And I can purchase
exemption for myself and for my father from
all this misery by taking you as my&mdash;husband?"</p>

<p>"Not purchase exemption," he replied; "but reward
fidelity and devoted service."</p>

<p>"Fidelity!" she exclaimed, starting up from the
stone on which she had seated herself again. "And,
if I reject your offer, you will let it loose upon our
heads? Am I to understand that to be the alternative?"</p>

<p>"I believe it to be inevitable as death," said he in

<!-- v1 page 188 -->

reply. "Your fate and your father's is in your hands.
It lies with you to decide whether it shall be life or
death, honor or infamy. And you must decide at
once."</p>

<p>"It will not take me long," said she, her eyes flashing,
and her voice tremulous with anger. "I give no
credence to what you say. I believe you capable of
any villany, of contriving any plot, to compass any
end you have in view. But do you suppose I will
believe my father capable of what you charge him
with? And even were he"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had you not better wait," interrupted Ferguson,
"until you know, whether capable of it or not, what
the case against him is?"</p>

<p>"The case!" she exclaimed, stamping her little
foot. "I care nothing for your case! You have
proved yourself a villain by the proposal you have
made me; and I am sure my father would sooner die
on&mdash;as you say, than suffer me to purchase his life
so infamously."</p>

<p>He looked as black as midnight, and scowled at
her as he said, between his teeth, "You reject my
offer, then?"</p>

<p>"Reject it!" she said, with a look of utter loathing.
"I spurn it! I trample on it! I spit upon it!"</p>

<p>"Then take the consequences!" he said, struggling
against a furious passion. "The ruin of your father,
which you might have prevented, be on your head!
And perhaps," he added, after a pause, in a quieter
tone, but one steeped in malignity,&mdash;"perhaps the

<!-- v1 page 189 -->

world will believe other rumors touching other
persons. I have helped suppress them. Perhaps it
will be impossible any longer. Mr. Markham has
been seen in this neighborhood, I believe."</p>

<p>Eleanor blushed deeply with just anger at this
insolence; and I stepped forward and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I accompanied this young lady hither by her
request and for her protection. You will repeat your
impertinence at your peril!"</p>

<p>"At my peril, you monkey!" he thundered out in a
towering passion, which he was glad to vent upon
somebody; and he advanced upon me with uplifted
hand. I was but a mouthful to him; but I happened
to take up, mechanically, as I came out with
Eleanor, the cane which I usually carried. It had a
blade in it, as college canes were very apt, foolishly
enough, to have in those days. I drew it in an instant,
and, shortening it as he approached, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lay a finger upon me, sir, and by &mdash;&mdash;, it will
be the last mischief you will do!"</p>

<p>Perhaps my eye was a little wicked; but at all
events, he stayed his hand a moment, while Eleanor
screamed aloud and was rushing between us, when
we were all brought to our bearings by a quick rustling
among the branches behind me, instantly followed
by Colonel Allerton's voice of command.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he said sternly to me. "Put up
that gimcrack, sir. What in God's name is the meaning
of this disturbance?" looking first at one and
then at the other.</p>

<!-- v1 page 190 -->

<p>"It means, sir," said I, "as far as I am concerned,
that that rascal there (perhaps the noun was qualified
by an expletive 'now better far removed') insulted
Miss Allerton, and when I interfered he offered to
strike me; and I was only giving him to understand
that he wouldn't do it more than once."</p>

<p>"Ferguson! Eleanor!" he said, in a great amazement.
"What is the meaning of this? Eleanor, is
it true that he insulted you? Frank must be beside
himself."</p>

<p>"Insulted me! Yes, indeed, sir," said she, "and
you too."</p>

<p>"Me? Impossible!" cried the father. "In what
way, pray?"</p>

<p>"Miss Eleanor," Ferguson put in, as if to give her
time to reflect and withhold her communication, "regards
the renewal of my unfortunate addresses as an
insult to her and you. But I hope, sir, you may not
regard it so seriously when you know my motives for
my presumption."</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, papa!" cried Eleanor. "He
is a liar, and the truth is not in him. What do you
think," she continued, going up to him and resting
her hand on his shoulder and looking up into his face,&mdash;"what
do you think this wretch has been saying
about you?&mdash;that you had committed some horrid
crime,&mdash;forgery, I believe,&mdash;and that it depends on
him to save you or to"&mdash;and she burst into tears
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "and the price of his silence, of

<!-- v1 page 191 -->

your life, I believe, was to be Eleanor's hand in
marriage."</p>

<p>"Ferguson, are you mad?" said Colonel Allerton
to him. "Can you have said these things?"</p>

<p>"Mad!" cried Ferguson, who did seem nearly beside
himself with rage and disappointment. "Mad
indeed! Well for you if I were! <i>Can</i> I have said
these things? I have said them, and they are TRUE!"</p>

<p>"True!" exclaimed the Colonel. "Mr. Ferguson,
you know such charges as these must be brought to a
strict account."</p>

<p>"Strict enough, sir," replied Ferguson, with a devilish
sneer; "you may be assured, of that. But it
must be by twelve men, and not by twelve paces.
Satisfaction, sir, is the due of a <i>gentleman</i>, and not a
FELON."</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" cried the Colonel; and, shaking off
Eleanor, he snatched my blade, still unsheathed, and
made a step towards the other. Eleanor clung again
to his arm, and I stepped between them; while Ferguson
said, laughing loudly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come on, by all means, sir. Add murder to your
other crimes. A man can be hanged but once!"</p>

<p>"Tush!" cried Colonel Allerton, tossing down his
weapon.&mdash;"I meant nothing, Eleanor, my girl. It
was an involuntary movement. Let the rascal go.
I wouldn't touch him."</p>

<p>"I humbly thank you, sir," cried Ferguson, taking
off his hat and making a mock bow to the party, with
eyes full of hatred and malice; "and, since I have

<!-- v1 page 192 -->

your gracious permission, I <i>will</i> go, as I have business
elsewhere. Good morning."</p>

<p>And, turning round, he stooped under the branches
of the trees in the side opposite to the entrance on
our side, and disappeared. As we stood looking after
him, we could hear him crashing his way through the
undergrowth and the interlacing boughs of the forest.</p>

<!-- v1 page 193 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND WHAT CAME NEXT.</p>

</div>

<p>WE stood in silence for a moment after Ferguson
disappeared under the branches. I scarcely
knew which way to look; but, without knowing it, I
found myself glancing out of the corner of my eye at
Eleanor, who had remained standing during all the
last part of this singular scene. She stood gazing
earnestly at her father, whose eyes were not yet withdrawn
from the place where Ferguson had vanished,
with an expression upon his face in which a towering
passion seemed to contend with an extreme astonishment.
Presently, however, as if controlling himself
by a strong effort, he turned to Eleanor, and taking
her arm under his, without saying anything, hastily
proceeded to the avenue and thus on to the house.
I followed at a proper distance, so that they might
have spoken together, had they chosen to do so, without
fear of being overheard by me. But they made
no use of the opportunity, both appearing to be absorbed
in their own thoughts; or, rather, the father
seemed plunged in a moody cloud of meditation, while
the daughter was anxiously considering him and his
conditions. Though she stepped firmly, and kept pace

<!-- v1 page 194 -->

with her father in his hurried walk, I could see that
her arm trembled upon his, and that she was trying,
as she had opportunity, to get an unsuspected glance
at his face.</p>

<p>That I felt a profound curiosity, as well as interest,
about what I had seen, need not be said; though I
could not help feeling that my presence, although
fairly and honestly brought about, might be intrusive
and unwelcome. So I was meditating a sudden
and secret retreat as soon as we approached the
house, thinking that, as my room might be better
than my company, it was very likely my companions
would not notice my sudden substitution of the
one for the other. Just as they entered the house,
however, through which it was necessary for me to
pass to make a dignified retreat, Eleanor said a few
words to her father, with a glance at me over her
shoulder. I pretended to drop my cane, and lingered
behind so as to leave them free to say what they
liked about me; when Colonel Allerton stopped, and,
turning round to me, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Frank, step into my room, if you can spare the
time. I should like to have your advice in a matter
of some importance."</p>

<p>I felt greatly flattered of course, and looked on
myself as promoted to be a middle-aged man at a
jump; or, at least, as having received the brevet
rank of five and twenty. I passed on through the
hall and went into the library, the father and daughter
remaining in conference near the hall door, while

<!-- v1 page 195 -->

I seated myself before the fire that was never quenched,
and gazed up at the white wig, rubicund face, and
wild, protuberant eyes of his late Majesty, who returned
my look with a half-frantic expression not
altogether out of keeping with the queer doings of
the last hour. Presently I heard Eleanor's step ascending
the stairs, and immediately afterwards that
of her father approaching the door of the library. I
rose as he entered; but he made me a sign to take
my seat again, and then walked two or three times
up and down the room in silent thought. Then seating
himself on the sofa, which made an angle of
some sort (I never was much of a mathematician)
with the fireplace, he turned to me with the cordial,
confiding air which marked his manner, whatever
might have been the reserve it covered, if Mr. Bulkley's
theory was right, and began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Frank, you will have a lively scene to
describe in your next letter to the Deipnosophoi.
Quite a godsend to your journal, by Jove! You
could hardly have hoped for anything so animating
in such an out-of-the-way corner of the world as this.
I am sure I little thought what was coming when I
walked down the avenue to meet you as you came
back, and to make Ferguson come along with you."</p>

<p>"I will not deny, sir," I replied, "that I have
been deeply interested in what I have seen this morning,
and in what has come under my notice before as
to this Mr. Ferguson, if that be his name; but I beg
to assure you that nothing I have seen or heard will

<!-- v1 page 196 -->

ever be told to any living soul, unless it be the wish
of my cousin Eleanor and yourself that the facts I
have been witness to should be truly stated at some
future time."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," he answered. "I believe
you to be a discreet lad; and perhaps it may be as
well not to make this adventure a topic of gossip just
yet. It is quite likely it may become such, however;
and, in such case, I am quite willing to leave your testimony
in your own keeping, to be used or withheld
at your own discretion. And I am sure Eleanor would
feel the same. She has a high opinion of you, Frank,
my boy; though the little accident by which you
were brought into Parson Bulkley's keeping did not
argue vehemently in favor of your prudence and
steadiness of character at first."</p>

<p>I blushed to the very soles of my boots to hear
this opinion of Eleanor in my favor; though, had I
known as much as I do now, (the more's the pity!) I
should have known that prudence and discretion are
not always the best recommendations of a man to a
woman. Luckily for me, however, these virtues have
not always been so inconveniently preponderant as to
stand materially in my way.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to my cousin Eleanor and
to you, sir," I said, half laughing at the conclusion
of his speech, "for your good opinion of me. I am
sure that I shall always look on the accident you
speak of as one of the luckiest things that ever could
happen to me; as, without it, I should have never

<!-- v1 page 197 -->

known you, or her, or Mr. Bulkley. I do not pretend
to be wise above my fellows; but I have sense enough
to know the value of such friends as you all have
shown yourselves."</p>

<p>"I thank you for our share of the compliment,"
said the Colonel; "and the rather, considering the
character which you have just heard an older acquaintance
than yourself bestow upon me, and the fate
he was obliging enough to suggest as my due."</p>

<p>"His may be an older acquaintanceship than mine,
sir," I replied; "but I know that mine is the better
of the two; for it is enough to make me laugh at
any such ebullition of spleen as that."</p>

<p>"I was taken by surprise this morning, myself,"
he resumed; "and was nearly as much astonished as
you could have been at what Ferguson said. I have
always thought well of him, and, had Eleanor fancied
him, I should have been very well content to have
had it a match. But she seems to have known him
better than I did. By Jove! these women have an
instinct which is a surer protection to them than
the knowledge of the world we men brag so much
of."</p>

<p>"She certainly had an escape; sir," I interpolated,
as he paused; "for he must be a precious scoundrel,
besides having a devil of a temper."</p>

<p>"You are right, undoubtedly," he went on; "though
I was not clear-sighted enough to read him so. I
thought him a sincere friend in the vexation in which
I was involved through your friend Markham's <i>&eacute;tourderie</i>;

<!-- v1 page 198 -->

and I liked him all the better for it, because he
was a rejected admirer of Eleanor's. But no doubt,
as I always supposed indeed, he hoped thus to recommend
himself to her."</p>

<p>He paused, and, as I knew nothing of the circumstances
of which he spoke, I had nothing to say,
excepting a confused observation to the effect that he
would have been a fool as well as a rogue if he had
failed to do his endeavor in such a cause. But the
Colonel did not heed what I stammered out, but went
on as if no break had taken place in the chain of his
ideas.</p>

<p>"However that may be," he continued, "there is no
doubt now as to his villany; and I only wish that I
knew the extent of it. Angry as he was, and carried
by his passion beyond his self-control, he had some
meaning in what he said. It was 'miching malicho,'
as Hamlet says, and meant mischief. I dare say he
would give his ears (I wish to God they were nailed
to the pillory, as they deserve to be!) that he had
kept his tongue between his teeth. But, as he was
surprised out of what he did not mean to say, I must
make my advantage of it. And the first thing I must
do is to get back to England as soon as I can to
confront his charges; for I have no doubt that he is
already on his way thither to make them, whatever
they may be."</p>

<p>"To England, dear papa!" said Eleanor, who
entered by the door behind him as he was uttering
the last sentence; and she laid her hand caressingly

<!-- v1 page 199 -->

on his shoulder. "To England! And why to England?"</p>

<p>"Because, my love," he replied, taking her hand in
his as he spoke,&mdash;"because it is there I must be
hanged, if Mr. Ferguson be a true prophet. I really
don't recollect having done anything worthy of death
since I came to America. Ferguson is not a fool;
and he did not talk in the way he did, though he was
in a passion, without some vicious meaning or other.
He has some design, and it must be put into execution
in England; and there I must be to counteract it."</p>

<p>She passed round the corner of the sofa where he
sat, still holding his hand, and seated herself by his
side.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear papa," she said, in a voice full of
tender emotion; "do not put yourself within the
reach of that villain. You do not know his ability in
wickedness. You will find it more than a match
for your innocence and the simple honesty of your
way of dealing. Pray, do not go! Stay here with
me!"</p>

<p>"What! my dear," he said to her half reproachfully,
but all tenderly, "you surely would not have me stay
here, and admit by default whatever slanders he may
have concocted? That is not like my Eleanor. For
my own part, I had rather mount the drop at Newgate
next Monday morning than live under such an imputation.
I will at least show my own confidence
in my innocence, whatever happens. But you shall
remain here until the whole thing is settled."</p>

<!-- v1 page 200 -->

<p>"I remain here!" she exclaimed, her eyes filling
with tears, which she hastily brushed off her long
lashes before they fell,&mdash;"I remain here, papa, while
you go to difficulty, if not to danger! That would be
like me, indeed! You know that I was not thinking
of myself; but I have a dread of this man's power
of mischief which I cannot help. He has haunted
me for more than two years; and I am afraid of
him, I confess. If we are beyond his reach here, for
God's sake, sir, let us stay here till he is out of our
way."</p>

<p>"For more than two years, Eleanor!" said her
father, in a tone of surprise. "What do you mean,
my dear? How comes it that I have never heard of
this before?"</p>

<p>Eleanor blushed deeply, and, looking divinely
downwards, said, after a moment's pause, "I could
not tell you, papa: indeed I could not. I could
not trust you; for the man&mdash;&mdash;" She paused a moment,
and then added, as if with pain and difficulty, "The
man insulted me. And"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Insulted you!" exclaimed her father, starting up,
with a deeper imprecation than I had ever heard come
from his polished lips. "Why did you not tell me of
this on the instant? But it is not too late to overtake
him yet." And he had his hand upon the bell-pull,
when Eleanor seized his arm, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearest papa, this man is not worth your anger:
he is beneath your resentment. What, what, are you
going to do?"</p>

<!-- v1 page 201 -->

<p>"Do!" he exclaimed. "I am going to order my
horse and be after him. I can be in Boston as soon
as he."</p>

<p>"And what then, papa?" Eleanor persisted, still
holding on to his arm.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, my dear. I will find a way to
chastise him for his insolence. Have no fears on that
score," said the veteran; and he glanced significantly
at me.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear papa," expostulated Eleanor, in a tone
that might have disarmed Sir Lucius O'Trigger himself,
"surely you would not put your life on a level
with that wretch's, if that is what you mean: for
you can hardly hope to inflict any chastisement
in any other way. And now you wonder that I did
not tell you all this two years ago. You have a
pretty way, haven't you, of coaxing my confidence?
Come, now, sit down by me again, and ask Cousin
Frank there if he does not think you a choleric,
testy, foolish old gentleman."</p>

<p>Bluebeard could not have withstood such entreaties
and the blandishments that accompanied them;
and Colonel Allerton did sit down again, evidently
growing cooler and cooler, and said, "Well, and what
does cousin Frank think on the subject?"</p>

<p>"I think, sir," I replied, "that you do well to be
angry for such a cause; and I can find no fault with
your wish for satisfaction if it were a case in which
it could be had. But, putting aside the question of
whether this man is entitled to be treated like a gentleman,

<!-- v1 page 202 -->

I suppose he could use this accusation, whatever
it is, as he has already suggested this morning,
as a reason for refusing to meet you if he chose.
And besides, sir, you will remember this is not Old
England; and the ordeal by combat is not one our
Puritan notions accord with."</p>

<p>"Very true, very true, Frank," he said, quite
calmed down again. "I was an old fool to have
thought of such a thing. And then he might say
that I wanted to rid myself of my accuser in this
extra-judicial way. So go on, my love, and tell me
how he has continued to annoy you since"&mdash;And
his eyes flashed again, and his hand clinched,
at the thought he did not utter.</p>

<p>"He hinted to me before we left England," she
resumed, "substantially what he said to-day&mdash;that
he had your honor, if not your life, in his hands.
And he made me believe that he actually prevented
your arrest, when we were on the eve of sailing, by
putting the officers on a wrong scent."</p>

<p>"And why did you not tell me all this, my child?"
said her father.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was wrong, papa," she answered; "but
I did what seemed to me for the best. I knew you
well enough to know that nothing would prevent you
from staying and facing any hazard if you knew of it;
and I was weak enough to wish you safe on this side
the water. I knew that the perplexity into which
Mr. Markham's imprudence had thrown you was
capable of being put into a bad shape; and I was

<!-- v1 page 203 -->

sure that this man was capable of twisting it into
any shape that suited him best. So I let things
take their course. But, if I have done wrong, I
have been fully punished; for I have suffered tortures
of mind the last two years." And she closed
her eyes and pressed her hand to her forehead, as if
in severe bodily pain.</p>

<p>"My poor Eleanor," said her father, tenderly taking
her hand, "you would have done better to have
told me all this. I could have convinced you that
his assertion about the arrest must have been a lie,
and that so his others most likely were."</p>

<p>"Could you indeed, sir?" said Eleanor. "He
told it to me connected with so many circumstances
which I knew to be true, and actually pointing out
the officer, that I thought that was certain, if nothing
else."</p>

<p>"Had you been acquainted with affairs, my dear,"
he returned, "you would have known that an arrest
of such a character could not be initiated without a
degree of notoriety which would have followed us
here, and that the subsequent legal measures could
not be done in a corner. But no matter for that
now: let me know what you have had to do with
Ferguson since then."</p>

<p>"He wrote to me several times from England,
proposing to renew his addresses to me, and on
that condition, to hush up the 'ugly business,' as he
called it.&mdash;The next time I knew anything of him
was when we saw him together at the river," she

<!-- v1 page 204 -->

said, addressing herself to me; and then, after briefly
reciting the adventure to her father, she proceeded,
"One other letter, under cover to Petchell, (as, indeed,
all his letters were sent), came while Cousin
Frank was in Boston. It was postmarked 'Washington.'
But I was on the lookout for this; and as
soon as it arrived, without opening the outer sheet,
I sent it back to him at Boston, where I knew he
would be before leaving the country."</p>

<p>"And that was the reason, no doubt," said her
father, "why he enclosed the letter of this morning
to Frank here. He thought it would be more sure
of being opened, if it came through him; though, to
be sure, it might have met with no better luck than
its precursors had it not been for Frank and me."</p>

<p>"It certainly would not," she replied. "But I
am very glad now it happened so, though I was
not very well pleased with it at first, as you may
have surmised," turning to me, (she was quite right&mdash;I
had so); "for I am now rid of the first secret I
ever kept from you, papa; and it shall be the last, I
promise you."</p>

<p>And she put her arms round his neck and kissed
him twice. Great Heavens! why was not I sixty-five
years old and a papa? Sir Walter Scott somewhere
feelingly complains of the affliction caused "to
us male creatures" by the sight of the caresses which
the ladies are so fond of wasting in such unnecessary
profusion upon one another. I am not sure that it is
any better to see them thrown away upon heavy

<!-- v1 page 205 -->

fathers and stupid brothers. However, it is a part
of the discipline of this mortal life; and I had to
submit to it in this instance, as in a many since.
Colonel Allerton presently resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But still, darling, I am not clear that I ought
not to return to England, to show that I am not
keeping out of the way of his accusations. What
think you, Frank?"</p>

<p>Eleanor gave me an imploring look; and, as I
certainly had no wish to give an answer that should
send them out of the country, I replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot give you any opinion, sir, on the subject.
I do not know enough about it to have formed one.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" he replied. "I have been talking
to you all this while under the belief that Eleanor
had made you her confidant and told you all about
our affairs."</p>

<p>I assured him that I had not been thus happy.
And Eleanor, while she confirmed my statement, was
good enough to say that she had determined to do so
at the very first opportunity that offered itself.</p>

<p>"I did so long for a friend to talk with about these
things, which I could not tell whether I ought to
keep to myself or not! I was so in want of advice
and comfort!" she said and sighed.</p>

<p>Oh, why had she not yielded to this impulse? I
do not know how I might have answered as a friend
and comforter; but I am sure I should have done
my best; and, at any rate, it would certainly have
been a very great comfort to me.</p>

<!-- v1 page 206 -->

<p>"You would have done right," replied her father.
"Frank is entitled to our thanks and our confidence;
for he has shown himself truly discreet and friendly,
as I understand it, and he shall have both." I
bowed, and he continued, "In fact, there is not much to tell
you. Just as I retired from the army, now more than
twenty years since, old Vinal Grayson, who had been
the agent for the loyalists ever since the year '80,
died; and, as it was important that the post should
be held by some person having some knowledge of
the colonies and the people claiming relief from time
to time, I was persuaded by Lord Hobart, then colonial
secretary, to act in that capacity, though much
against my will. For, though a limitation of time
was prescribed in the bill for the compensation of the
loyalists, still the government was very liberal and
considerate in the admission of claims in cases of
special hardship which might be strictly barred by
lapse of time."</p>

<p>"The British government stood handsomely by
those who stood by them, I have always heard,"
said I.</p>

<p>"You have heard the truth," he replied. "Of
course it was impossible to satisfy the demands of all
that made them; nor could the real losses we sustained
be made good. But the successive ministries
all behaved as well as they could, I believe. But
this liberality exposed the government to the danger&mdash;which,
indeed, is incident to all systems of compensations
and pensions&mdash;of fictitious and forged

<!-- v1 page 207 -->

claims. This could hardly be avoided with the greatest
diligence, especially as many of the pensioners
had returned to this country, and the distances over
which they were scattered made it very hard to keep
a strict eye upon them all."</p>

<p>"That is plain enough," said I. "I should think
it must have been out of the question."</p>

<p>"We did our best," he went on; "but it was hard
to guard against all the devices of the enemy. Some
three years ago or thereabouts I was strongly suspicious
that an extensive fraud had been carried on
for some time. In the course of my investigations I
had consulted with this Ferguson, as I had done
frequently before, regarding him as a shrewd legal
adviser, and as one particularly well qualified to act
as such from his own connection with the loyalists.
Young Markham, too, who was frequently at my
offices in London with his father, and who was just
then about to be entered at the Inner Temple, was
also taken into confidence and employed in a subordinate
capacity from time to time."</p>

<p>"What was the nature of the fraud you suspected?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"It was a claim purporting to be of one Michael
St. John," he replied, "for a large seizure of specie
and goods which he was transferring from New Jersey
to New York, at the beginning of the Revolution,
for protection from the British troops, and taken by
the rebels. With interest upon interest, it was made
to amount to near fifty thousand pounds. It seemed

<!-- v1 page 208 -->

so well supported by vouchers and affidavits, and the
case as stated appeared so hard a one, that Mr. Perceval
(for it happened during his short rule) consented
to allow the man a pension of five hundred pounds a
year for his life, provided Mr. Jackson, then minister
at Washington, should certify to the necessary
facts. This was done; and as soon as the certificate
arrived in due form it was all settled, as I supposed;
and all I had to do was to remit the money to New
York every year on receiving the regular evidence
that the man was alive."</p>

<p>"And how long did this go on, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"For eight or nine years," he answered; "and it
would never have been suspected that there was anything
amiss, had I not had occasion to look into some
American despatches in the foreign office on another
matter relating to my department; and, to my surprise,
I found no record at the time the certificate of
the identity of St. John was sent over, of any such
transaction. Mr. Jackson was dead, and his secretary
at one of the Northern courts; and there was no immediate
way of sifting it. I looked farther back, and
found several other cases of like nature (of less
amount, but very considerable in the aggregate), all of
which were payable to the same agent in New York
who held St. John's power of attorney."</p>

<p>"And what did you do then, sir?" I asked, naturally
interested in the story.</p>

<p>"I at once sent for Ferguson," he answered, "who
seemed as much perplexed and amazed as I was;

<!-- v1 page 209 -->

and he advised me to say nothing for the present to
the colonial secretary, but to lay a trap for the rogue
at New York, so as to get his testimony as to the
origin of the business."</p>

<p>"And you did so, I suppose?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am sorry to say I did. It was the grand
mistake I made. I ought to have reported the whole
thing at once; for when it transpired in that quarter&mdash;as
it very soon did, through Markham's imprudence
or ill luck&mdash;it had an ugly look."</p>

<p>"And how was that, sir?" I inquired of him.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "Markham had a brother who was
a clerk in the colonial office; and he happened to be
there one morning when the secretary came through
the room where he was. He remembered that Markham
had been sent to him by me on business once or twice,
and called him into his private room to ask
him some questions on a matter to come before Parliament
that day, that he supposed he might know
about. I can't tell you how the cross-purposes occurred;
but Markham, supposing he was speaking of
this matter, of which his own thoughts were full,
made answers which aroused the curiosity of the
minister, and he did not release him till he had
learned all he had to tell."</p>

<p>"That was unlucky, certainly," said I. "But it
was rather poor Markham's misfortune than his
fault."</p>

<p>"So I have tried to persuade papa," Eleanor put
in, blushing and looking down; "but he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- v1 page 210 -->

<p>"Ah, but you forget, my dear, that, although he
was taken by surprise at first, he admitted that he
went on deliberately afterwards in his account of the
matter, thinking forsooth that it was best for all parties!
He think, indeed!"</p>

<p>"But perhaps he was right, papa," said Eleanor,
growing a little warmer as she went on. "You say
that you were mistaken in not doing this very thing
at first; why, then, are you so very severe on poor
Mr. Markham?"</p>

<p>"He and I were very different people, my dear," he
replied; "and the conduct which might have been
wise in me was uncalled for and impertinent in him.
And that is harder to forgive than an intentional injury&mdash;of
which I have never suspected him. Had
he held his tongue, we should have been at Walford
to-day instead of Wensley."</p>

<p>I really could not find it in my heart to bear him
malice for that; though I did not think Miss Eleanor
had any occasion to blush so when she named him.
I only said, however, "And what was the upshot,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, the upshot was, as you might suppose, that
the minister was high, and I was as high as he. He
spoke of the whole business in a way that I could
not stand, sir; and I threw up the office on the spot.
His lordship made no objections to receiving my
resignation, and soon afterwards appointed this very
Ferguson my successor."</p>

<p>"Ferguson!" I exclaimed.</p>

<!-- v1 page 211 -->

<p>"Oh, yes," he replied; "and a very proper appointment
it seemed to me then." Eleanor lifted up her
eyes and hands as a slight protest. "Well, there was
no reason I knew of why it was not, my dear; and I
made no quarrel with Ferguson on that score."</p>

<p>"But how was this connected with your coming to
America, sir, if I may ask?" said I.</p>

<p>"Very naturally," he answered. "As these frauds
had occurred during my incumbency, I felt myself
bound to do my best to get to the bottom of them, and
to bring the perpetrators to justice. It was due to
the government and to my own character; and the
most direct way seemed to be to look into them in
person and on the spot. And so I came over; and,
as this foolish girl would not be left behind, I had to
bring her with me."</p>

<p>"And what success have you had, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Indifferent enough," was his reply. "The conspirators
on this side the water must have had timely
notice of the discovery: for I have got no trace of
them yet; and I fear I never shall now. But I had
resolved never to go home until I had cleared this
mystery up; and nothing but some imputation on
my honor and character, such as Ferguson threw out
to-day, would shake my resolution."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir," I suggested, "what he said was
a mere burst of spite and vexation; for I must say
that my cousin's reception and treatment of him were not
of a gratifying description. Will it not be time enough
to decide and to act after you have some definite information

<!-- v1 page 212 -->

as to what he means to do and say? Possibly
you may never hear from him again."</p>

<p>"I do not think that at all likely," he rejoined.
"But, as you say, perhaps there is no hurry about it.
At any rate, I will be ruled by a girl and boy to the
extent of taking time to consider before I do anything
further."</p>

<p>And Eleanor thanked him again in the manner
heretofore protested against by Sir Walter Scott and
myself. I added, when this was over,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I wish, sir, you would take the boy's advice
in another particular."</p>

<p>"Ah, and what is that?" said he, smiling graciously.</p>

<p>"I wish you would take Mr. Bulkley into your
counsels. He is odd, but kind; and a genuine friend
to this house, if faith may be given to his words
behind your backs. And he is shrewd and wise in his
generation, and as true as Toledo steel; and I know
that your confidence would be very gratifying to
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have the highest value for the good Parson,"
he replied good naturedly, "and would trust him with
my soul, body, and estate. I do not imagine he can
do much for us; but, if you should like to take
him into counsel, I have no objection.&mdash;Have you,
Eleanor?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, papa," she replied; "and I think he
is a very knowing old man. Perhaps, as Cousin Frank
says, he may make some useful suggestion. At any

<!-- v1 page 213 -->

rate, he will be a kind and good friend; and surely
we have no superfluity of such."</p>

<p>"You may tell him what you think best of our
affairs, then," the Colonel said in conclusion, "whenever
he comes home, and say I should like to talk
matters over with him. And now, come, take Eleanor
into the dining-room; for you must be ready for
your dinner by this time."</p>

<p>And so in truth I found myself, as soon as I could
descend to consider the matter; and, as the hour
when poor Jasper had spread his table for me was
long past, I made no resistance to this hospitable
suggestion. I don't know whether I ought to put
it on record or not; but the fact is, that, notwithstanding
the agitations of one kind and another we had undergone,
we gave all the evidence good appetites could
imply of good consciences. During dinner we talked
on indifferent subjects; and the servant who waited
on us could not have suspected from our ways that
anything out of the common course had occurred
that morning. Such are the funny conditions of the
human microcosm. After dinner I returned to the
parsonage, and applied myself to my classics with
what appetite I might.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.</p>

</div>

<p>BY the encouragement of Colonel Allerton and
Eleanor I was almost daily at Woodside until the
return of the good parson, which was delayed
several days beyond the time he had fixed for it.
And, so curious is the mechanism of humanity, it
seemed to me that I had never seen them so much at
their ease as since the adventure of the Sachem's Seat.
Eleanor, particularly, seemed as if she had thrown a
load from off her heart; and its shadow, which used
too often to steal over her features, had disappeared
with it. There was certainly a little flush of excitement
often on her cheek; but the air of abstraction
and revery was gone entirely. Her manners to her
father were more caressing and tender than ever, and
to me as open and affectionate as a friend could desire.
Colonel Allerton retained his old calmness of exterior,
and looked, as he said he was, as if he were waiting
for the next move. Eleanor spoke freely to me of
the relief she felt at having this mystery which had
been haunting her for so long take a definite shape,
so that she knew what it was she had to fear, and
at the restoration of entire confidence between her

<!-- v1 page 215 -->

father and herself. I had a full intellectual sense of
the rascality of Ferguson; but I could not but feel
that he had done me the best of service by putting
me into these confidential relations with the people
I valued the most on earth.</p>

<p>Things went on thus for some days until the minister
at last returned. I was standing ready to assist
him in alighting from the coach, which arrived just
before tea-time. I noticed that he did not seem so
cheery and lightsome of mood as he usually was;
but I attributed it entirely to the fatigue of the
journey, which even he might feel more than he
would choose to admit at seventy years. At tea I
asked him as to the issue of his onslaught on the
Hog's Neck; and he told me that Mr. Hayley had
given him in writing just such an opinion as he expected,
and which he was sure he could use to restore
peace within the walls of Jericho. But, still, he did
not treat the matter in the jocose and airy strain with
which he was wont to encounter such oddities of
adventure. Indeed, he did not seem to be thinking
about it even while giving me this account of his
success. I thought, too, that I could observe him
regarding me, when he thought I was not noticing
him, with an air of deep sympathy and commiseration.
In short, he had a good deal the air and manner of
one of those fearful friends who have some
piece of bad news for you which they keep back in
order to prepare you for the shock, but which they
can't help from peeping out from the corners of their

<!-- v1 page 216 -->

eyes and mouth, and which frightens you ten times
more than the baldest and rudest display of the facts
would do.</p>

<p class="small">"&mdash;&mdash;Ye gods, avert<br/>

Such plagues from righteous men!"</p>

<p>When Jasper had withdrawn the tea-things and
gone about his business to some other part of the
domain, I said to Mr. Bulkley,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you do not seem yourself this evening.
You are not usually so done up by a journey
of twenty odd miles, are you? You have heard some
bad news I am afraid, sir."</p>

<p>"Bad news!" he repeated. "Why so? why should
you think I had heard bad news? I have heard
none that affects myself or you particularly." And
I could see that he was eying me with the look of
a tender-hearted surgeon (if such an anomaly exist)
just before cutting off the pet leg of his intimate
friend.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, it relates to the Allertons," I suggested.
"I don't know who else there is that we
have any common interest in."</p>

<p>"The Allertons!" he replied, still looking kindly
but mournfully at me. "And why should you think
of them and bad news together? Have you any
reason to suppose that any such may be likely to be
heard of them?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have, sir," I answered; "and I will not
imitate their reserve, of which I have heard you complain,
if you will be as open with me."</p>

<!-- v1 page 217 -->

<p>"I have little to tell, my dear boy," said he, with
strong marks of surprise and interest in his face;
"and that is merely the gossip of Boston, which
may have no foundation whatever. So, pray, tell me
what it is you mean."</p>

<p>Thus urged, I proceeded to tell him all that I have
already told the world in the foregoing pages, and
especially the final explosion, not forgetting the permission
they had given me to take him into the
secret and the request of Colonel Allerton for his
counsel.</p>

<p>"The secret!" said the minister, after he had listened
with the most earnest attention to all that I
had to say. "I am afraid that there is no longer
any secret to be admitted into. This business was
the talk of Boston this morning. I do not mean
that all the details you have given were blown; but
there was a vague rumor that Colonel Allerton had
fled his country for some great crime which had
only been recently discovered. As to my advice
and assistance, if I can afford any, God knows all
I have is at their service. But, Frank, you seem
to have been taken into their confidence in a remarkable
sort of way. I should have been most
glad to have known it before this mischief developed
itself."</p>

<p>I assured him that my being admitted into their
counsels had been owing to inexorable circumstances,
and that I had received no more confidence from
them than had been extorted by the necessities of

<!-- v1 page 218 -->

the case. He shook his head and said, sadly, after
a short pause,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am an old fool, I suppose. But I had been
building a castle in the air for you and Eleanor, I
confess; and I was made unhappy, I admit, by the
thought that this scandal would probably blow it sky
high. I never made a match for myself; but I have
always been making matches&mdash;planning them, that
is&mdash;for other people. To be sure, I have been
oftener disappointed than not in my schemes."</p>

<p>"This scandal, sir," I replied, determined to keep
a good face, though I caught my breath a little as
I spoke,&mdash;"this scandal would have nothing to do
with your castle; for I am afraid that I am not the
man Eleanor has chosen to inhabit it with her.
But had it been otherwise, and should even this
slander be proved to be truth, I should have scorned
myself if I permitted the fault of a father to influence
my feelings or my conduct towards such a daughter,
had I any species of claim upon her, which I certainly
have not."</p>

<p>"You are right, Osborne," he replied, still looking
sadly and kindly at me, which I pretended not to
observe,&mdash;"you are right, and speak as a man of
honor and just feelings should. But suppose we
walk up to Woodside at once. We shall find them
just done tea."</p>

<p>Of course I made no objection to this proposal;
and we were soon on our way thither, only making
a forced halt at the post office, where the Parson

<!-- v1 page 219 -->

was intercepted by Major Grimes, Deacon Holt, and
several of the other dignitaries of the village, and
compelled to disburse the latest news from town.
He then received, in his turn, their contributions
as to the condition of the parish, particularly as to
health and sickness; for I believe I have forgotten
to tell, among other particularities of Wensley, that
the Parson was not only its lawyer, but its doctor
to boot. Whether it was owing to his skill in
medicine (for he had dabbled a little in that as
in almost everything else) or to his very moderate
exhibitions of the same, Wensley was always in
a state of rude health truly disheartening to any
young and enterprising practitioner; so that the
few that had ever pitched their tents there had
soon struck them again and departed for more hopeful
fields of labor.</p>

<p>Jasper was Mr. Bulkley's main assistant in his
medical practice; for he had learned to breathe a
vein during the war, with perfect accuracy, when in
attendance for a while on the hospital department;
and, as phlebotomy was still a main arm of
the war service against disease at that time, he was
an invaluable auxiliary. In cases of a critical character,
to be sure, he would call in the famous Dr.
Whittredge, of Sandover, who was his ancient friend
and willing adviser, and almost as great an oddity
as himself. When I was last in Wensley there
were more doctors' signs even than meeting-houses,
regular and irregular, allopathic, hom&oelig;opathic, hydropathic,

<!-- v1 page 220 -->

botanic: all systems had their zealous professors,
ready to dispense life and health to all who
had the faith and knowledge to come to them. I
wonder whether Wensley is better in body and
soul now than it was when Priest Bulkley lorded
it there, with gentlest despotism, in things temporal
and eternal?</p>

<p>We were most kindly received, on presenting ourselves
at Woodside, and the good parson cordially
thanked for the promptitude of his visit. If there
were any embarrassment on either side at the meeting,
it was on ours. Colonel Allerton and Eleanor possessed
their souls in the same calm and imperturbable
equanimity which generally marked their manners,
and which I alone had been permitted to see disturbed.
We talked over the Ferguson business with
perfect openness and discussed its various bearings
freely, or rather the elders did; for Eleanor and I were
only listeners, for the most part.</p>

<p>They did show some sensibility, indeed, when Mr.
Bulkley told them that their affairs were the town
gossip in Boston that day; for who can know that
their conduct is the theme of common talk and vulgar
discussion, however blameless they may know themselves
to be, without a feeling of wounded pride and
a bitter sense of injustice&mdash;to feel that, at that very
moment of time, hundreds of strangers, or, which is
worse, professing friends, are engaged in exclaiming,
wondering, and conjecturing about your affairs, and in
tearing your character to shreds&mdash;extenuating nothing,

<!-- v1 page 221 -->

and setting down everything, if not in malice, at
least with a good nature, which is an excellent imitation
of it? However, they swallowed the momentary
pang, and the conversation proceeded.</p>

<p>"The essential thing to be done," said Mr. Bulkley,
"seems to be to discover the agent who was employed
to receive the moneys in New York. Have
you no clew to him?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," replied Colonel Allerton. "I
made it my first business to inquire him out; but he
had disappeared past recovery. He had no domicile,
apparently, there, but came to the city as the remittances
were expected."</p>

<p>"That is strange," said the Parson. "But does it
not occur to you as possible that some trace might be
got of him by the way of this St. John you speak of&mdash;the
man in whose name the pension stood? Of
course he is probably dead; but there must have been
such a man, I take it, and somebody must remember
him."</p>

<p>"I don't know that," replied the Colonel. "I could
hear nothing of him in all the inquiries I could
make after him. Did you ever hear of such a
person?"</p>

<p>"No," said the minister; "I never did. But, then,
I have no acquaintance in the Jerseys; nor do I know
anybody that has. But stop a minute," he continued,
putting his finger to his forehead; "I'm not so sure
of that. There's my Jasper; he's a Jerseyman. It's
barely possible he may remember such a person; for

<!-- v1 page 222 -->

he never forgets any one, and especially a Tory,"
laughing as he spoke.</p>

<p>"It is not at all likely," replied the Colonel, "that he
should have put his rebel memory to so good a use as
this, especially as it would be to oblige another Tory;
but it can do no harm to ask him the question."</p>

<p>"Another thing," said Mr. Bulkley. "Has it ever
suggested itself to you that this Ferguson may have
had some cognizance of this matter? He seems rascal
enough for it."</p>

<p>"I certainly never thought anything of the sort,"
returned the Colonel, "until the other day. Since
then, I confess, it has occurred to me; but I have no
ground of suspicion except my ill opinion of him."</p>

<p>"But what are his connections in this country?"
asked the minister. "You said, I think, that he was
of Tory blood. That may give us some inkling to
guide us."</p>

<p>"His family were from the Middle States somewhere,"
answered the other; "though I believe his
mother was from New England. But she died before
I knew anything about them. His father was Colonel
Robert Ferguson, who died in Jamaica about the year
five. I knew him there ten years before."</p>

<p>The minister's countenance fell. After a brief
pause he asked, in a constrained voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was receiver-general there, was he not?"</p>

<p>"Receiver or registrar general, or something of
the sort," replied the Colonel, little thinking how
rude a wound he was giving his old friend.</p>

<!-- v1 page 223 -->

<p>I comprehended the whole in a moment. It
flashed into my mind at the same moment it did
into Mr. Bulkley's that this Ferguson must be the
son of the fair, the frail, the unworthy Julia Mansfield,
his first and only love, whose unworthiness he had
mourned more bitterly than her scorn or her death.
This man was the inheritor of her blood&mdash;her representative!</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley sat in silence for a few minutes as if to
recover from the shock, as I saw. Our companions
did not remark it; for, though they had heard the
story of the good Parson's cross in love, they had
paid no particular attention to the names of the
parties and had probably forgotten them entirely.
Presently he rose and took leave, saying he would
come again the next day and talk over the matter
further.</p>

<p>"And if you will give me leave," said the Colonel,
as we were leaving the house, "I will walk down to
the parsonage to breakfast to-morrow and hear what
Jasper has to say on the St. John matter, if the day
be fine."</p>

<p>Of course this suggestion met with a cordial acquiescence;
and Mr. Bulkley and I passed out into
the night. It was cold for the season; but the chill
air seemed to refresh him. He drew a long breath
and set off rapidly towards home. Then he slackened
his pace and then quickened it again, as if unconscious
of what he did. I felt his arm tremble upon
mine, and knew that deep feelings and strong passions

<!-- v1 page 224 -->

agitated his aged bosom. I reverenced his sorrows
and paid them the homage of perfect silence. His
was a heart that never could grow old; and out of its
warm recesses what were the images that glided forth
and walked with him through that glimmering night?
What eye but his could see the phantom in all the
loveliness, and innocence, and gayety of fifty years
ago evoked by the necromancy of a chance word that
stirred his being to its depths? What visions of
youth, and love, and hope waited upon her! What
memories of disappointment, of despair, of grief,
harder to bear than either, followed after her! Who
but he could tell?</p>

<p>I could not tell what was the procession of shadows
that passed before him as we walked side by side;
but I felt that it was sweeping by, and I religiously
forbore to disturb it by a loud breath. I had no sense
of the fifty years that separated us. Something there
was (I wonder what it could have been?) that <i>contemporized</i>
us, to use a word of Sir Thomas Browne's
coinage. The sympathy I felt with him was that of
youth with youth, and not of youth with age. He
felt, too, that I understood him, though no words had
passed between us; and his grateful pressure of my
hand, as we stood on the door-stone, told me so and
thanked me for it. He took the candle from Jasper,
who opened the door for us, and went directly into
his bedroom, and we saw him no more that night;
though the great Bible lay open on his study table,
with the lights, all ready for prayers.</p>

<!-- v1 page 225 -->

<p>Jasper looked at me as I went in and took up one
of the candles, and said, shaking his head, "Somebody's
been a-talking to him about that Tory Mansfield
girl?"</p>

<p>I nodded acquiescence; and he went on: "I
knowed it as soon as I see him. It's been just so
this forty odd year that I've lived with him. Ah!
master Frank," he continued, in a truculent tone, "a
woman's bad enough, anyhow; but a woman that's
a Tory, too, is the devil!"</p>

<p>With this apothegm he made me his military salute
and left me to my meditations. And he had certainly
given me a text for them too. I could not help feeling,
as I lay in bed thinking the day over, that I
knew an individual of the kind, and with the specific
difference he had thus denounced, whom yet I could
not consent to refer to the order in the spiritual hierarchy
to which he had reduced all such in a lump.
While still engaged in these commentaries I fell
asleep.</p>

<p>The Colonel was as good as his word the next
morning, and arrived before Jasper had laid the table
for breakfast. Mr. Bulkley and I were walking up
and down the gravel walk which bisected the garden,
enjoying the clear light and bracing breath of a fine
October morning, when he passed through the house
and joined us. He seemed not quite as well at ease
as he had done the evening before; and, after salutations
had been exchanged, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My walk has been productive of more enlightenment

<!-- v1 page 226 -->

as to the state of my affairs than I had expected
when I proposed coming here."</p>

<p>Of course we both of us begged to know from what
direction this illumination had come.</p>

<p>"By a natural way enough," he replied. "As I
was passing the post-office, old Kimball came running
after me with a letter, which he said had fallen
aside yesterday afternoon when Snell went for the
letters. It is from the British Minister at Washington."</p>

<p>We neither of us knew precisely what to say; and
so prudently waited till he was ready to proceed,
which he presently did.</p>

<p>"It is a private and friendly, not an official letter.
He is my very old friend, and, as such, wishes to give
me all the help he possibly can. But, as it might be
misrepresented, perhaps it is better that the circumstance
should not be mentioned."</p>

<p>We assented; and he gave Mr. Bulkley the letter,
who read it out as we walked. It was friendly in its
tone, but diplomatic in its terms, and gave no more
information than was necessary for his object. Beginning
with expressions of regret at what he had to tell,
his excellency informed Colonel Allerton that charges
and evidence had been forwarded to England by the
packet of the sixth which might give rise to a criminal
prosecution against him, but which he, the Minister,
was sure Colonel Allerton was fully prepared to
meet and explain. He thought it not improper, considering
their ancient friendship, to state to him these

<!-- v1 page 227 -->

facts, in order that Colonel Allerton might take such
measures for his exculpation as the case demanded.
And he felt it the more incumbent upon him, as a
personal friend, to give him timely notice, inasmuch
as Colonel Allerton must be aware that his property
in England would be taken possession of by the government,
to await the final issue of the affair.</p>

<p>"It's very odd, by Jove!" said he, when the reading
of the letter was done, "that I had never thought
of that before. But of course it is a fact; and I must
reduce my establishment within the limits of my
American property, which, unless your general court
sees fit to let go its gripe on the Clarke estate, is little
enough. But, luckily, I have just received the
balance of my half-yearly settlement with my agent
at home; so that I am not absolutely without the
means of carrying on the war for a while."</p>

<p>Our consideration of this point was presently interrupted
by Jasper, who appeared to announce
breakfast. While we were engaged in discussing
the admirable results of his morning's labors (and he
had an artist's pleasure in making the work of art
before us as perfect as possible) Mr. Bulkley said to
him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jasper, in what part of New Jersey did Colonel
Cuyler live?"</p>

<p>"Up north, sir," he replied, "among the mountains,
on Marking's Kill, three or four miles west of Williamsboro',
near the Pennsylvany line."</p>

<p>"Very good," responded the minister. "And did
you ever happen to know a man in Jersey named

<!-- v1 page 228 -->

Saint John&mdash;Michael Saint John?" giving out the
name of the evangelist with emphatic distinctness,
and laying particular stress on the title which Christendom
in general agree to prefix to it, (though he never
used it in his public services, regarding it as a rag of
Romanism), so as to impress the name strongly on
Jasper's mind and to recall the man if possible.</p>

<p>Jasper took time to consider, during which we
hung upon his lips in anxious expectation; but he
shook his head and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, sir; I never knew any such man there, nor
nowhere."</p>

<p>All our countenances fell a little at this, as we had
all entertained a faint hope that we might get some
glimpse of light from our dark friend. Even Colonel
Allerton looked rather disappointed; though he affirmed
that he had reckoned nothing on this most
remote and unlikely possibility. So we presently resumed
our conversation and pursued it as if this interruption
had not taken place, and went over again
the St. John mystery, as men will talk over a hopeless
business, as if discussion gave relief, if not hope.
We none of us minded Jasper's presence; both because
we knew that he might be trusted with an
absolute confidence, and because there seemed no particular
reason for making any more of a mystery of
the matter than it was in its own essence. After
breakfast Colonel Allerton took his leave and proceeded
towards the village, leaving the minister and
me to our morning tasks.</p>

<!-- v1 page 229 -->

<p>We had not been long engaged upon them when
Jasper came into the room from the garden, whither
he had repaired after disposing of his breakfast things,
and said to Mr. Bulkley,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir; but I have just been
thinking that I used to know another man in Jarsey
that you were talking of this morning."</p>

<p>"Another man!" said the Parson, rubbing his forehead.
"I don't remember, whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, I used to know a Mr. <i>Sinjin</i> there before the
war. I don't know whether you care about him, sir."</p>

<p>"Bless your soul!" cried the Parson, jumping up.
"And was his name Michael?"</p>

<p>"I believe it was, sir," replied Jasper; "though
I'm not sure of that. But there was a Mr. Sinjin
lived the other side of the Kill, about two miles off.
My master hadn't much to do with him latterly; for
he was a bloody Tory, and went down to York before
we went to the wars."</p>

<p>"It must be he! it must be he!" exclaimed the
minister, making the historian Tacitus describe a somerset
in the air quite out of keeping with his usually
staid and saturnine temperament; and then, clapping
his hands, added, "It must be the very man, Osborne,
mustn't it?"</p>

<p>I assented to the probability.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of him since then, Jasper?"
he continued.</p>

<p>"No, sir," Jasper answered. "I have never heard
of him or about him for better than forty year."</p>

<!-- v1 page 230 -->

<p>"Never mind, never mind," the sanguine Parson
proceeded. "We have found the first track; and it
will be hard if we don't follow it up. You could
direct us to the very place, I suppose, couldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, yes, sir," answered Jasper. "I
could find my way there in the dark if you'll put me
down at Williamsboro'."</p>

<p>"To be sure you could!" said the minister; "to
be sure you could! This comes of the English habit
of eating up proper names. The Colonel shall not
hear the last of it soon, I promise you. <i>Sinjin</i>,
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir," I suggested, "he may have something
to say to you; for, if you had given the name
as he did, Jasper would have known what you meant.
He was the judge of how the name was to be pronounced,
you see, after all."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you see the man was a Tory," said
the minister, in high spirits; "so it's no wonder he
didn't know how his own name should be pronounced,
is it, Jasper."</p>

<p>"He <i>was</i> a Tory," answered Jasper, simply, as if
that was the gist of the matter, as he left the room.</p>

<!-- v1 page 231 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">IN WHICH GREAT PROGRESS IS MADE.</p>

</div>

<p>I SUGGESTED to Mr. Bulkley that it would be
well to lose no time in apprising Colonel Allerton
of what Jasper had said. He assented to the general
proposition, but added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It will be soon enough after dinner. This is news
that will keep cold. And as our studies have been
somewhat interrupted of late, I think we will hold by
them this morning, if you please."</p>

<p>Of course I had to comply, whether I pleased or
not; and we resumed our lecture, though to what
degree of edification I do not think I can precisely
testify at this distance of time. The morning was
over, however, at last, and dinner was despatched, and
a proper interval allowed for the difference of dinner-time
at Woodside. Then the Parson told me I had
better proceed on my errand by myself, as he must
make a journey to Jericho to settle the rights and
wrongs of the Hog's Neck. So I set off alone, not
unwillingly. On arriving at Woodside I entered the
hall-door, which was standing hospitably open, it being
a fine day, though well on in October, without

<!-- v1 page 232 -->

giving any warning of my presence. My habits of
intimacy at the house also authorized me to enter the
parlor where Eleanor usually sat without ceremony.</p>

<p>The room was never very light, owing to the shadow
of the piazza and the climbing and drooping plants
that festooned it; and on that afternoon the curtain
of the second window to your right was let down to
keep out the blaze of the westering sun. As I entered
I saw, as I thought, Eleanor and her father seated at
the very end of the room in earnest conversation&mdash;so
earnest, indeed, that they did not at once notice my
approach. I advanced hastily, full of my news, when
the pair rose in evident haste and embarrassment on
perceiving me. I had my message on my lips, when,
my eyes turning from Eleanor to her companion, I
was astonished at seeing that it was not her father,
but Mr. Harry Markham. My own confusion eclipsed
theirs when I perceived this conjunction, which my
heart misgave me boded me no good.</p>

<p>The feeling that mine was a most unwelcome intrusion
crimsoned my cheeks for a second; but a bitterer
pang soon drove the blood back to my heart. A flash
of light seemed to search the closest coverts of my
being, and I saw myself as I never did before. I
had never said, even in my secret thoughts, "I love
Eleanor Allerton!" till now that I felt that she was
lost to me forever. It seemed as if years had passed
over my heart since I entered the house a few moments
before. I was a youth no longer. The passions
of a man burned fiercely in my heart, and the simplicities

<!-- v1 page 233 -->

and follies of boyhood shrivelled and vanished in the
flame.</p>

<p>I was conscious that my agitation of mind was
written in my face. I felt that my knees trembled
and my throat was parched; and I waited a moment
till I was sure of commanding my voice before I
spoke. But I was master enough of myself to see
that I was not the only embarrassed one of the party.
Whether it were the sight of my emotion, or the conflict
of strong feelings of her own, the alternations of
Eleanor's countenance (and its expression changed
continually) had a painful, suffering air as she looked
at me, which I thought I could read plainly enough.</p>

<p>"She is sorry for me&mdash;poor, foolish lad!" I said
bitterly to myself; and I felt as if I could eat my
heart with rage that she should know that I was to
be pitied.</p>

<p>"And does <i>he</i>, too, extend his tender compassion
to me?" I continued, within my teeth,</p>

<p>I could not tell; but I thought, on thinking it over
afterwards, (I could only see and feel then), that his
thoughts were not on me. Why should they be?
He was not a demonstrative person at any time, and
his face was not a book easy to be read. But it did
not express a mind at ease. A mind at ease! Disturbed,
perhaps, at the very height of his dream of joy,
and hardly knowing whether it were a dream or a
reality, how could it be at ease? It must be so. And
I&mdash;I had discerned where my life of life was garnered
up, just as it was scattered to the winds. It was

<!-- v1 page 234 -->

a cruel moment for me&mdash;a moment into which an
eternity was crushed together.</p>

<p>As soon as I could somewhat command my voice
I stammered out, in a huskyish tone, "I&mdash;I beg
pardon; but&mdash;but I had a message for your father;
and&mdash;and I thought I should find him here. Is he
in his library?" And I made towards the door by
which I had entered.</p>

<p>Eleanor advanced towards me and said, not without
agitation of look and voice, "Stay here, Cousin Frank;
I will call him. He will be glad to see you; and we
will hear your message together, if there be no
objection."</p>

<p>And she disappeared through the arched doorway
which led into her father's room. Left alone with
Markham, he came up to me and offered me his hand,
which I could not refuse; and we exchanged a few
sentences of mutual inquiry, though I have no recollection
of what it was now, if I had any perception of
it at the time. I stood in a whirl of thoughts and
emotions which I could not analyze. I could not
reason; I could only feel that the lamp of my life
was trampled out just as I discerned the shrine before
which it burned, and that I was doubly orphaned
from that hour forward.</p>

<p>I had not long to wait however; for, as we were
talking, I heard the quick step of Colonel Allerton
moving about in his room; and almost immediately he
entered, alert and erect as ever, followed by Eleanor.
After giving me a friendly greeting he said,&mdash;</p>

<!-- v1 page 235 -->

<p>"And so you have a message for me, Eleanor says.
And what has the good Parson to say now? You
needn't mind Markham here. He knows all that
we do." And he gave him an open, cordial, friendly
look, very different from the frigid politeness of his
address when I saw them last together, but which
stung me to the heart. What could be the meaning
of it? Was there to be a mystery always brooding
over this house?</p>

<p>I told my story as collectedly as I could, but with
very little of the animated interest which I had
brought with it from the parsonage, but which I had
laid down at the threshold of that room. Luckily it
was not a very complicated narrative, or I should
have bungled it; for I was thinking but little of what
I was saying. My statement, however, greatly
interested Colonel Allerton; and he succeeded in
making the other two talk it over with him as a
circumstance which might possibly grow to some
importance in their affairs. I took no part in the
conversation, and found it hard to express the interest
I ought to feel, and really did at bottom, when any of
them addressed themselves to me. I could see that
Eleanor was privily observing me, which did not
assist me in concentrating my ideas; but Markham
was clearly so full of what concerned himself and his
friends, for such they now plainly were, that he had
no thought to bestow on me. Colonel Allerton,
however, was more observing; and after the matter
had been discussed and put in all probable points of

<!-- v1 page 236 -->

view, and not much more remained to be said, he
turned to me and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what ails you, Frank, my boy? You are not
like yourself this afternoon. Are not you ill?"</p>

<p>I confessed to a headache, (though I apprehend
that the seat of the disease was not the <i>head</i>), and
rose to depart, to cover myself from further observation.</p>

<p>"Nay, but stay and spend the rest of the afternoon
with us," the Colonel hospitably urged. "You have
not seen Markham this long time; and I prescribe
his good company and Eleanor's as excellent for a
headache. I have tried half the mixture," he continued,
looking at Eleanor, "often myself, and have
always found it a sovereign remedy."</p>

<p>I tried to laugh; and I thought, though I did not
say so, that the remedy was like to be worse than the
disease. So I resolutely excused myself, alleging that
Mr. Bulkley would expect me and that I must go.</p>

<p>"Then come again this evening," persisted the Colonel;
"and be sure and bring him with you. I want
to hear his opinion about it."</p>

<p>I was going to decline again on my own account;
but, looking at Eleanor, I saw her eyes fixed on me,
while her lips expressed rather than uttered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do come!"</p>

<p>So I half muttered and half bowed an assent and
hurried away. Still, as I walked homewards I again
resolved that I would not return to Woodside again
while Markham was there. I could not endure it.

<!-- v1 page 237 -->

It was plain, that, however it had been brought
about, the displeasure which Colonel Allerton had
felt towards him, and in which his daughter had certainly
appeared to share in a lesser measure, was
now removed. He was there apparently on familiar
and intimate terms. Could it be possible that the
change in their circumstances had bent the proud
spirits of the father and daughter, and made them
willing to accept addresses for her now which they
had spurned in more prosperous days? That his
name had been connected with hers, that there had
been a closeness of connection and intimacy between
them enough to excite remark and gossip, I knew
from Ferguson's insolence, which compelled my interference,
at the Sachem's Seat. I had observed,
too, her embarrassment on more than one occasion
when he had been spoken of, and her attempts at a
partial defence of him from the strictures of her
father.</p>

<p>I soon rejected all that was unworthy of Eleanor
and her father in these surmises. I blushed that I
had ever entertained them. It lowered me in my
own eyes. But still, the main result of my conference
with myself on the subject was the same.
Everything confirmed it. His coming to America
at this time; his reserve on my first acquaintance as
to his relations with her; the particularity of these
relations at some former time, proved by the very
coldness and distance of his treatment at his first
visit as well as by what Ferguson had said; her

<!-- v1 page 238 -->

own looks and language when he was in question;
this sudden change of demeanor towards him; the
earnest <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> I had interrupted,&mdash;all, all proved
beyond a peradventure that whatever had parted
them was removed&mdash;that Markham was the favored,
the accepted, lover of Eleanor Allerton.</p>

<p>Well, suppose he was. Was it anything to me?
Could she ever be anything to me more than the
kindest of sisters and friends? I cursed the idea of
sisterhood and friendship. An hour before, I should
have blessed them. The scales had fallen from my
eyes, and I saw that they were not what I wanted.
I cursed the hour that brought me to Wensley; and
the next moment I cursed myself for the thought,
and could have wept to think of never having known,
though but to lose her forever. In short, I was furiously
in love and furiously jealous, and was guilty of
as many follies as my predecessors and successors in
that category. Follies are they? Perhaps they are;
but there is a good deal of what passes current for
wisdom that one would exchange for them if one
could&mdash;ay, and give boot into the bargain.</p>

<p>I had some time to torment myself with these
thoughts and imaginations before the Parson returned.
But at last he arrived, chuckling over the
success of his mission, which, it seemed, had resulted
in the renewal of the family compact between the
two dynasties, to be consolidated by the marriage of
Jerry and Sukey and confirmed by the sacrifice of
the Hog's Neck. Mr. Bulkley was so full of his

<!-- v1 page 239 -->

story that he did not remark the slight attention I
gave to it, though it was garnished by many of his
best imitations and attended by a running accompaniment
of his merriest laugh. At last, however,
when he was entirely done, and had wiped the tears
from his eyes, which always waited on his best
laughs,&mdash;tears like those of Matthew, "of one worn
out with mirth and laughter,"&mdash;he suddenly seemed
to catch sight of my face as of some new thing.</p>

<p>"Bless me, Osborne!" he exclaimed, "What is the
matter with you? Has anything happened at Woodside?
Nothing wrong there, I hope."</p>

<p>"Everything is wrong there for me, sir," I replied,
bitterly; and then, yielding to an impulse
which seemed to urge me on whether I would or
no, I told him the whole history of the afternoon,
of the revelation which it had made to me of myself,
and of the cruel despair in which it had left me. I
have said before that the minister was a chosen
confidant of love troubles within his own jurisdiction;
and I now felt the influence upon my own
mind which made him such. I do not think that
there was another human being to whom I could
have made that confession. But there was a sweetness
and sympathy of soul about that blessed old
man that invited and drew forth perfect confidence.
I never could have said the same thing to any of the
Deipnosophoi. No, indeed. The sense of the ridicule
which is so often, though so cruelly, made to
wait on a hopeless passion, bad enough in itself,

<!-- v1 page 240 -->

heaven knows, would have sealed my lips upon the
rack. But such an idea could not be associated with
that of my dear old friend. Were there many such
priests as he, I should accept the sacrament of confession.
He listened to my story with the tenderest
interest and tried to give me what comfort he could.
But I thought I could discern, under all the consolation
and encouragement he gave me, that he was
of my opinion in the matter. Indeed, he gave me
no direct encouragement; only he soothed my
irritation of spirit so wisely, and showed me how I
might have been too hasty in my conclusions, after
all, that it had the effect of comforting me.</p>

<p>At teatime I could hardly help laughing through
all my distress to see how the good old man pressed
upon me the best of everything on the table, and
made Jasper bring out his choicest stores, reserved
for solemn occasions. If the very best tea in the
house, and preserves, and marmalade, and diet bread
(as sponge cake used to be called in those days)
were a specific for a wounded spirit, mine would
have been whole on the instant. I did my best,
however, to satisfy his kind intentions; and soon
after he had released me from my endeavors, which
hardly came up to his wishes, I reminded him that
Colonel Allerton wished to see him at Woodside.
I was still inclined to remain at home; but he would
not hear of it, and insisted on my accompanying him.</p>

<p>We arrived before the Woodside party had risen
from their tea table. And here I saw again that the

<!-- v1 page 241 -->

relations of the parties around it were changed since
I last assisted with them at that evening sacrifice.
Here was no <i>lap tea</i>, but a well-spread, sociable
board, around which the three sat as friends, with
every appearance of entire cordiality. I was sorry
I had agreed to come. But it was too late then;
and I took my share of the welcome extended to us
with the best grace I could assume. I could feel
with "the sixth sense of love" that Eleanor's eyes
were often fixed upon me with a melancholy earnestness
when I was looking another way; but they
were dropped or withdrawn before mine could meet
them. I despised myself for being the object of her
pity; and I could see that Mr. Bulkley was covertly
watching us; and this did not assist in the preservation
of my equanimity.</p>

<p>We soon adjourned to the Colonel's room, where
his wood fire gave out a cheerful, crackling, dancing
light, in which we sat and talked over what was
most in our minds (or rather in theirs), and never
thought of ringing for candles till it was nearly time
to break up the session. I did not attend much to
what was going forward; but I could perceive that
the talk was chiefly on the possibility of making
some use of the glimmer of light Jasper had thrown
upon our darkness, and whether it might not show
us a way out of our perplexities. After a brown
study of some duration, during which I sat with
my eyes fixed on the blazing logs and listening
rather to the spattering hiss with which the sap

<!-- v1 page 242 -->

exuded from them upon the hearth than to the
discussions going on around them, I was aroused
from it by hearing the minister say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"An excellent plan, indeed! And I'll tell you
what&mdash;Osborne shall go with you. He is entitled
to have a run for a week or two; and I'll be
answerable for him to the authorities at Cambridge."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," replied Markham; for it
appeared that the remark was addressed to him; "it
is just what I should have proposed myself if the
plan went forward. What say you, Osborne? Will
you go with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly; that is," I stammered out
rather uncertainly, "if I can be of any use&mdash;if
Mr. Bulkley thinks best."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do think it best, by all means," the minister
replied; "so consider that as a settled thing."</p>

<p>As I thought I might as well know what the
settled thing was of which it seemed I was to be
a component part, I rallied my thoughts and tried
to fix them on what was going on; and before we
parted I had gathered that Mr. Bulkley had inspired
the Colonel with a portion of his own confident
belief that Jasper's information might be followed
up to some good result; and they had agreed that
Jasper had better be sent to the spot with some
judicious person, who might pursue the game which
he might by possibility set on foot. Markham at
once volunteered to be the judicious person aforesaid,

<!-- v1 page 243 -->

and offered to set off on the shortest notice;
and it was as an amendment to this suggestion that
the minister moved that my name, too, should be
put into the commission. As soon as I understood
how it was I fell in with the plan with a feverish
eagerness; for I was just in the state of mind
when motion and change of place are hungered
and thirsted after. I felt a burning, longing wish
to be anywhere away from Wensley, and was comforted
to hear that we should set out the following
day.</p>

<p>It soon grew to be time to go; and we took leave
at the same time&mdash;Mr. Bulkley, Markham, and I&mdash;and
walked to the turning to Grimes's together. I
took a hasty leave of Eleanor and her father, and
resolutely pushed out of the room first, so as to give
Markham a moment with her without the Parson
and me as spectators, which I considered (and do
still consider) a handsome thing on my part. But
he followed very soon after us, which might have
surprised me had I not reflected, that he would
probably walk up the next morning to renew the
"sweet sorrow" of farewell. This hypothesis did
not tend to concentrate my thoughts on what was
passing between my companions; and I am not sure
whether it was during this walk that the parson extracted
from Markham the secret of his altered relations
with Woodside, or whether it was during the
next day's journey to Boston. But the facts were
briefly these.</p>

<!-- v1 page 244 -->

<p>Markham's brother, the clerk in the colonial office,
had just written to him, that it had transpired in
the office that it was Ferguson himself who had given
Lord Bathurst the hint touching the trouble in Colonel
Allerton's department, which had induced his
lordship to enter upon the cross-examination the
result of which had drawn down Colonel Allerton's
displeasure on poor Markham's head; and Ferguson
it was that had persuaded Markham that it was
best for all concerned that the facts should be made
known to the secretary, though it was done so skilfully,
that he could deny it with a good face if laid
to his charge; and Markham now remembered, that
it was Ferguson that contrived the accident which
took him to the colonial office that particular morning.
Having received this intelligence, and hearing
of the rumors about Colonel Allerton before they
had got wind fully, he sent it at once to Wensley
with all these explanations. He at once received a
cordial invitation to repeat his visit, which he lost no
time in doing, and had a very different reception
from the one he had before&mdash;the Allertons looking
upon him as the innocent instrument of the same
man who had wound his toils about themselves.
They acquitted him of all blame, even for indiscretion,
and felt the desire natural to generous minds
to make more than amends to one whom they had
treated with injustice. So he said to us. "Amends
with a vengeance!" said I to myself.</p>

<p>The next morning we were unable to take the

<!-- v1 page 245 -->

Haverford coach, as we had to apprise Jasper of his
unexpected expedition, and to make all our preparations.
Jasper entered into the plan very readily,
only doubting how his master would get on by himself.
But when he found that this difficulty had
been provided against by the Allertons insisting upon
his becoming their guest during the absence of the
grand vizier (or <i>wuzeer</i>, as they ridiculously spell it
now) on foreign service, his scruples were at once at
an end, and he lost no time in putting the house in
order for so extraordinary an event. As we wished
to make what despatch we could, we resolved not
to wait for the Pentland coach, which came along
towards night, but to put Black Sally into the Major's
covered wagon, and get over the ground before night.
When we had come to this conclusion Mr. Bulkley
suddenly expressed his determination to accompany
us as far as Boston. He should like the excursion,
he said; and he thought he could manage to drive
Sally back again by himself the next day or the day
after. Of course we were glad enough to have his
society&mdash;at least I was; for I did not care for a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> journey with Markham after all that had
passed. And I shrewdly suspect that it was the
feeling that this was the case, that induced him to
volunteer his company.</p>

<p>We arrived before dark, and, after putting our
horse up at the Exchange Coffee House stables, and
bespeaking our passage by the Providence coach for
the next morning, I proceeded at once to Mr. Moulton's,

<!-- v1 page 246 -->

accompanied by Mr. Bulkley, to obtain his
permission for the expedition. There was no great
difficulty in procuring this on the representations of
the good minister, for whom my guardian had conceived
a warm regard. I did not pay much attention
to the reasons he urged in my favor; but I well understood
in my secret soul, that the real ones which
induced him to make the original suggestion were
not so much the expectation of good to the Allertons
as of good to myself, which might accrue from this
diversion of thought and passion. However, the
consent was granted, and Mr. Bulkley prevailed upon
to be Mr. Moulton's guest for the night. Markham
did not come, though I had invited him. He is
writing to Eleanor, said I to myself; and the
glass of wine I had at my lips (though it was the
famous old Suffolk Madeira) almost choked me at the
thought.</p>

<p>The next morning came in due season. Who does
not remember, that is old enough, the morning of a
journey to New York in those days before railways?
I had slept but little during the night; and was just
fairly asleep, about four in the morning, when a
thundering knock at the hall-door and a violent ring
at the bell announced that the coach would soon
come lumbering along. Then the dressing in the
dark, the half-awake, slipshod servants, making a
pretence of getting you some breakfast, which was
always just too late; the dressing-gowned and slippered
friends (Mr. Moulton and the Parson in my

<!-- v1 page 247 -->

case) stumbling out upon you to see you off in spite
of your entreaties overnight, that they would do no
such thing. Then the long, hot or cold, dusty or
muddy, never pleasant journey to Providence. And
then the old Fulton steamer. How we used to admire
her! What a marvel of speed and comfort that ill-contrived
old hulk seemed to our innocent minds,
not as yet sophisticate with the later luxuries of locomotion!
To be sure, it was better than the week's
hard coaching which was necessary to bring the two
cities together before her time. And New York
itself,&mdash;Newest York now,&mdash;how changed since
that my first visit! Her very <i>caravanserais</i> have
fled, like the sojourners of a day. Where is Bunker's?
Echo, if she could make herself heard above
the roar of traffic, might answer, if she had nothing
better to say, <i>Where?</i> And where is the City Hotel?
Oh Chester Jennings, art thou indeed forever fled?
And the Park Theatre too? But I forbear.</p>

<p>We hurried through New York and put ourselves
on the road to Williamsboro' with all the speed we
could command in those more deliberate days. But
it took us nearly two days, as the roads were bad,
and the wagons, bearing the local rank of coaches,
yet worse. But here Jasper made our fatigues less
with the stories he had to tell, suggested by almost
every point of our route; for he was now among
familiar scenes. There, a mile or two on this side
of Hackensack, he had first smelt gunpowder, one
cold autumnal night, in a slight affair of outposts.

<!-- v1 page 248 -->

Farther on, it was coming out of that house that he
had first seen General Washington. And at Morristown,
where we spent the night, he showed us, not
only the head-quarters of the commander-in-chief,
but the very baker's shop over which he himself had
been billeted. And it happened, oddly enough, that
the business was still carried on by the baker's son, a
boy at that time, but who perfectly remembered the
sable guest of his father. The next day we got more
and more, as we advanced into his own country, and
he had a history for almost every house we passed.
It seemed to have been a region, fertile in Tories;
for his narratives were mostly of that tribe, which
was to him as that of Barabbas. We arrived at
Williamsboro' too late to push on to the scene of
our inquiries that night.</p>

<p>The next morning we took an open wagon and
pair and proceeded onward. Jasper's interest in all
the scenes about him now grew intense. He had not
seen them for nearly fifty years; and he seemed to
remember them and to cling to their memory with
the strong local attachment of his race. We sympathized
so strongly with his feelings, that, though in
impatient haste ourselves, we proposed a stop at the
house of the Cuyler family, where he was born.
But here he was doomed to disappointment. The
house was there, to be sure; but it was degraded
into a mere farm-house, and not a well-appointed one
neither. It had a decayed, tumble-down look; and
the out buildings and fences were sadly out of repair.

<!-- v1 page 249 -->

A shrewish-looking woman, not over clean, sharply
asked our business; and her inquiry was enforced by
half a dozen hungry, snarling curs, who opened mouth
upon us in full cry; while a swarm of dirty children
clustered about the door, staring over one another's
heads at the rare spectacle of strangers. She did
not seem particularly well satisfied with the account
we had to give of ourselves; and, though she called
off the dogs and did not order us to leave the premises,
she kept a suspicious eye upon us as we looked
about them.</p>

<p>But there was not much to detain us. The only
thing that recalled the former state of the Cuylers
was the old chariot of the family, which stood rotting
to pieces in a dilapidated coach-house with one door
off its hinges, and which, if not a habitation for
dragons and owls, was clearly one for cats and chickens&mdash;a
litter of kittens garrisoning the inside; while
the outworks bore unmistakable evidence of being a
roosting place for poultry. There had plainly not
been energy enough to clear away this old piece of
lumber, as it must have seemed to the occupants.
The woman of the house rather apologized for its
toleration by saying that the children liked to play in
it. But she had no knowledge of its former owners.
She came from Pennsylvania, she said, and had never
heard of the Cuylers. The very name of the family
seemed to have died out even upon their ancestral
acres. We left the place almost as sad as Jasper
himself.</p>

<!-- v1 page 250 -->

<p>We hastened on, and, crossing the Kill, soon arrived
at the house where the Michael St. John, the
unconscious cause of so much trouble to us all, had
lived. Jasper led us directly to its door, as he had
said he could, without inquiry or hesitation. And
here we received a very different welcome from our
last from John McCormick, its present owner. He
was a hale, middle-aged man, of a cheerful and intelligent
countenance, and well disposed to give us what
information and assistance he could. It did not seem
to be much, however. St. John had never returned
to that part of the country, the father of McCormick
having bought the firm of the State, by which it had
been confiscated; and he knew nothing of the
particulars of his fate. This seemed to be death
to our hopes. We looked with blank disappointment
in one another's faces; and Mr. McCormick
went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There has been inquiry made about this St. John
before; and if my father and I had not possessed this
farm for more than forty years, I should think there
was some design upon it."</p>

<p>"And, pray, when and by whom was there ever
inquiry made about him?" asked Markham, with
the air of a man catching at a straw.</p>

<p>"It was ten or a dozen years ago," McCormick
replied. "There was a man came from York way
who hunted up everything that could be found out
about him from town records, parish registers, and
what not. He didn't make much noise about it; but,

<!-- v1 page 251 -->

as I thought it might concern my title-deeds, I kept
an eye on him and found out what he was at;"</p>

<p>"And do you know his name?" asked Markham,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"His name? Yes," he answered. "Let me see.
Yes, his name was Abrahams; he was a sort of Jew
lawyer, I believe."</p>

<p>Markham and I looked at each other. It was the
name of the agent in New York who used to draw
the pensions.</p>

<p>"Abrahams!" said Markham. "And do you know
anything further about him, or where we should be
likely to find out where he is?"</p>

<p>But he knew nothing on the subject; and we were
in the dumps again. We liked the appearance and
frankness of McCormick so much, that, after a consultation
of looks between Markham and me, he
briefly stated to him our case and how important it
was to us that this man should be found, he being
unquestionably the accessory to the fraud on this side
the water. He could give us no clew to what we
wanted; and we talked over the matter in a spirit of
despair. Presently Jasper said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You say he was a Jew, sir?" McCormick assented.
"And his name was Abrahams? I wonder
if he could be the son of Aaron Abrahams, who was
a commissary in the year seventy-seven?"</p>

<p>"His name was Aaron, I remember," said McCormick;
and so did we.</p>

<p>"Did you know him?" said I.</p>

<!-- v1 page 252 -->

<p>"Know him!" repeated Jasper. "I guess I had
reason to know him. I know he almost starved us;
and would quite, had not a lot of our men threatened
to burn his house down about his ears for him. They
tried to do it, too. Ben Simpkins was hanged for it,
poor fellow!"</p>

<p>"Then you know where he lived?" asked Markham
and I in a breath.</p>

<p>"I guess I do," he answered, laughing. "I mounted
guard there for a month after poor Ben was hanged.
And I lived well too, I tell ye; for they was awfully
frightened."</p>

<p>"And where was it?" we all asked at once.</p>

<p>"It was down Monmouth way," said Jasper, "not
far from Horseshoe Inlet, near where the Falmouth
was wrecked. It was an awful wrecking-place, and
old Abrahams's house was full of cabin furniture and
things. Folks said he had got rich by wrecking. He
was rich, any way. But I don't believe such riches is
any good to people."</p>

<p>We looked at one another again and with more
hopeful faces. To be sure, it was not much to hope
about; but it was better than nothing. Jasper seemed
really to be our guardian angel; though poor Tom
might have called him a black one. We held a consultation
over this hint, and resolved, as we did not
know what better to do, that we would follow it up
and see whether we could get any trace of Abrahams
in that neighborhood. It was the faintest of possibilities;
but, as we had been disappointed in our

<!-- v1 page 253 -->

discoveries at this place, we were impatient to be trying
after them in some other. I felt relief only in
motion, and was in haste to be off.</p>

<p>McCormick pressed us to stay until after dinner;
in which case he agreed to accompany us, with a
reasonable compensation for his time, the rather as the
heaviest of the harvesting was now over. Markham
had made this proposition to him when it first occurred
to us to continue our search, inasmuch as it would be
convenient, if not essential, to have some one of the
party able to identify Abrahams if he could be overtaken.
So we yielded to his hospitable urgency and
partook of a plentiful Jersey farmer's dinner, presided
over by his eldest unmarried daughter, a fine girl of
eighteen, his wife having been dead for several years.
He was urgent, furthermore, that we should spend the
night there and commence our journey fresh in the
morning. But we would not hearken to this proposal;
and, according to our first plan, we set off about two
in the afternoon, our host with Markham in his own
wagon and pair of stout black horses, and Jasper and
I in the one we had brought from Morristown&mdash;having
first sent information of our intentions to the
owner, so that we need not have the hue-and-cry after
us as horse-thieves.</p>

<p>In this order we traversed nearly the entire length
of the state. It took us nearly three days to accomplish
it. I had purposely chosen Jasper as my companion,
because I could talk with him or be silent as I pleased.
I was moody enough for the first part of the way;

<!-- v1 page 254 -->

but, when we got upon the line of operations of the
campaigns of '76 and '77, I could not help being
diverted from the gloomy train of my own thoughts
by the lively reminiscences of my companion. He
was familiar with the whole of the ground; and it
was like having been part of those movements one's
self to hear his account of them. It was the little
personal details proper to himself that gave this DeFoeish
air of reality to his narrations.</p>

<p>When we were passing over the battle-field of
Monmouth, for instance,&mdash;"It was about here," said
he, "that I was coming up with the reserve when
General Washington came riding back from the front,
where he had been on a lookout. It was an awful
hot day; and he pulled up by me and says, says he,
'Jasper,' says he (for he had seen me often with Colonel
Cuyler when he was alive, and had slept under
the same tent with me, bless you, the night before we
got to Morristown), 'Jasper,' says he, 'what have you
got in your canteen?' 'Rum and water, sir,' says I.
'Very good,' says he; 'let me have some.' I took it
off and reached it to him. 'Take a drink first yourself,'
says he (that, you know, was because somebody
had tried to poison him just before). So I took a
pull; and so did he, a good one too, after me; and
then we went into action."</p>

<p>Farther on towards the sea coast, too, his knowledge
continued fresh; for he had been stationed in
that quarter to keep the Tories in order during the
spring of '77, after the successes at Trenton and

<!-- v1 page 255 -->

Princeton (in both of which he partook) had induced
Sir William Howe to evacuate the Jerseys.
Towards night on the third day we reached a shabby
little village, or rather hamlet, not far from the shore,
called Sinkers&mdash;a place of a very evil reputation
as the head-quarters of wreckers of the worst description,
who in those days, not to say in these too, infested
that "shipwrecked coast." At the wretched tavern
which dispensed their daily rum to these worthy citizens,
and at which we were compelled to put up, we
directed Jasper to try and find out what he could
about this tribe of Abrahams without exciting notice.
This he easily did while busy about the horses in the
stable; and he soon came to us with the unexpected
intelligence that the commissary was yet living at his
old house, though much reduced from his former flagitious
prosperity, as Jasper had esteemed it.</p>

<p>Encouraged beyond our hopes by this news, we
sent him forward that night to reconnoitre his old
ground and find how matters stood. When he returned
he reported that he had attempted an entrance, but
had been repulsed by the very commissary whom he
had helped to guard in former days. He could not, or
would not, remember any such service; and refused
to acknowledge any gratitude for it or to admit him
to whom he owed it into his house.</p>

<p>"There was sickness there," he said; "he could not
come in. There was a tavern at Sinkers; he might
go there." The noise of this discussion brought up
the effective reserve of Mrs. Abrahams, an aged

<!-- v1 page 256 -->

matron among the daughters of Israel, who opened a
fire of flying artillery upon him, which soon made him
beat a retreat. "What business had he to come there
at that time of night disturbing them, and they with a
son at the point of death in the house? If he didn't
take himself off they'd let fly the blunderbuss at him
for a black rascal as he was." And much more of
the same sort.</p>

<p>So Jasper did take himself off, and reported progress
as above. Matters seemed now to be in the
train we had long wished for. We considered what
step to take next, and agreed that the time had come
for the interposition of the civil arm if we could get
hold of it. We were for looking up the nearest magistrate;
but McCormick dissuaded us, on the ground
that it would be better to procure one from a little
farther off the coast. So we gladly assented to his
proposal that he should mount one of his horses and
ride back to Monmouth and apply to "an honest
lawyer," as he termed him, whom he had had dealings
with, to come over and help us. The next
morning early he accordingly appeared with this
phenomenon, Mr. Sturdevant by name, and an officer,
in case of need. About ten o'clock we proceeded
to the scene of action. We left the large
covered wagon at the foot of the steep, sandy hill,
just on the other side of which Abrahams's house
stood, and walked up it, both for the sake of speed
and secrecy. Jasper was to bring it slowly after
us.</p>

<!-- v1 page 257 -->

<p>Arrived at the door of the house, it was some minutes
before we could effect an entrance. We were
aware that we were reconnoitred; and it was not until
we made an assault on the door that threatened to
bring it down that it was at length opened by old
Abrahams himself. He would fain have held parley
with us; but we pushed by him into the room at our
right, of which the door was open, and which proved
to be the kitchen, but yet the apartment usually
occupied by the family. Here we made a stop, and
the old man had time to ask us our business. To
this, under the circumstances, not unreasonable request,
Mr. Sturdevant stated that our business was
with his son Aaron, whom we knew to be in the
house. He denied the fact, and fortified his denial
by a volley of imprecations more appropriate to the
character of a Christian than of a Jew.</p>

<p>Mr. Sturdevant intimated to him that he had the
necessary process and officer, and should proceed at
once to satisfy himself by a search of the premises.
Old Abrahams seemed greatly alarmed at this information;
and, changing his tone, begged to know why
it was that this perquisition was set on foot. He was
informed that it was on a charge of being concerned
as principal or accessory in an important forgery.
This naturally enough increased the old man's distress;
but he still persisted in maintaining that his
son was not there, but with less voluble assurance.
At this point the wife, the very heroine who had routed
Jasper and put him to flight, came in by a door

<!-- v1 page 258 -->

opening into the kitchen, and said, disregarding the
signals telegraphed to her by her husband,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what do you want here? What business
have you to disturb an honest man's house in this
way? Are you the gang of that black rascal that
tried to break in here last night? Don't you know
that there's a sick man in the house? Get off with
you, or you'll be the death of my poor son. He's
been plagued enough already this morning, poor
fellow, and you'll finish him!"</p>

<p>This is a very faint copy of the tirade with
which she favored us, and which seemed to produce
more effect on her husband than on us. He
stamped with his feeble foot, and clinched his
fist impotently, more at her than at us, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>"We must see your son, ma'am," said Mr. Sturdevant,
kindly but firmly.</p>

<p>"You shall do no such thing," the dame responded
as resolutely, setting her back against the
door.</p>

<p>"It must be done, ma'am," he continued, in the
same tone; "but it shall be done as quietly and
with as little disturbance to him as possible."</p>

<p>He then gently removed her, though she struggled
violently and made a resistance which saved
the credit of her courage and spirit, although she
had to yield to a superior force. We pushed
through a narrow passage, at the end of which was
a door opening into a bed chamber, where lay the

<!-- v1 page 259 -->

man we were in search of, propped by pillows,
and testifying by his looks to the truth of what
we had heard as to his condition. As soon as we
had looked at him, our eyes all involuntarily
turned upon McCormick, who signified by a nod
and look that he was the man we were after.</p>

<p>Having received this confirmation, Mr. Sturdevant
approached the bedside of the sick man to
open his business. Just at this moment we heard
a loud noise, in which Jasper's tones were distinguishable,
as if there were some difficulty on
his line of march. At Markham's request, McCormick
went out to see what the matter was,
while we remained to see the main play played
out. Mr. Sturdevant had not advanced very far
in his cautious statement of the reason of our
being there, when we heard loud voices and footsteps
approaching the house. Jasper's and McCormick's
voices were soon heard in the kitchen; and
Markham and I forthwith went thither to see what
had happened. Jasper we found sitting on a rush-bottomed
chair, with one arm over the back, looking
very faint, while a stream of blood was dribbling
down from the ends of his fingers upon the
floor. But this spectacle did not hold us long when
we looked at the third person of the party.</p>

<p>"Ferguson!" exclaimed Markham.</p>

<p>I was too much amazed to say anything.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Ferguson!" the other repeated fiercely.
"And I should like to know whether it was you

<!-- v1 page 260 -->

that set this black ruffian upon me as I was peaceably
upon the highway."</p>

<p>Markham and I looked at each other, not knowing
exactly what to say, when the magistrate came
out of the sick chamber, and we briefly explained
the facts. He turned to McCormick, who only said
that he had found Jasper and this man struggling
together on the ground, the former wounded and
bleeding, and had merely interposed and brought
them both along to the house; which he was quite
competent to do, though Ferguson was a strong man.
We all now turned to Jasper, who said, rather
feebly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"First tie a handkerchief tight round my arm,
just below the shoulder." This was done at once.
"Now, Master Frank," he went on, "put your
walking-stick through the bandage and give it a
hard turn, and hold it so." I did as I was directed;
and this extemporized <i>tourniquet</i>, which
Jasper had learned in the hospital, stopped the
bleeding. A small exhibition of brandy, of which
medicine McCormick happened accidentally to have
a moderate supply about him for emergencies, restored
poor Jasper to the speaking point.</p>

<p>The amount of his information was, that as he
was slowly coming down the sandy hill, having
stopped for some time on the top to rest the horses,
he saw a window of the Jew's house open, and a
man jump out of it and hurry up the hill towards
himself. It immediately occurred to him that this

<!-- v1 page 261 -->

must be the very man we were after; and, accordingly,
he appointed himself to the service of cutting
off his retreat. This he found to be one of no little
difficulty and of some danger, inasmuch as his
antagonist drew a knife after they had closed, and
stabbed him in the arm; and, had not McCormick
come to his assistance, the enemy would have made
good his escape.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Ferguson, "this is all
true enough; but what objection have you to make
to what I did? I merely defended myself when
attacked, without provocation, on the highway."</p>

<p>But Mr. Sturdevant intimated that his sudden
exit from Abrahams's window, taken in connection
with the known circumstances of the case, would
justify his detention for further inquiry.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Ferguson; "you know that
you act at your own peril; and you may be assured
I shall exact all the redress I can get."</p>

<p>Mr. Sturdevant merely bowed his acquiescence
and said, "But you also know, sir, that I must have
your person searched. Anything not bearing upon
this case will be immediately returned to you." And
he called the officer from the bed chamber.</p>

<p>At this announcement Ferguson turned pale as
death, and, hastily putting his hand in his pocket,
drew out a crumpled packet of papers and threw
them on the fire. Luckily it was an economical
household, and the fire was but newly kindled.
Ferguson sprung forward to strike them into the

<!-- v1 page 262 -->

coals with the heel of his boot, but was held back
by McCormick; while I snatched them, only a little
singed from the flames. This authorized more emphatically
his being taken into custody, which was
formally done. But the papers did not afford us
much light at the first glance, as they were written
in cipher and were Sanscrit to us. After a brief
consultation aside, Mr. Sturdevant returned alone to
the sick Jew's chamber, taking the manuscripts with
him. We remained busy in taking care of poor
Jasper, who seemed very weak, and in keeping guard
over Ferguson. But his spirit seemed to have deserted
him. He appeared as one stunned, and sat
in gloomy silence at the table, leaning his head on
both his hands. Markham and I exchanged looks of
congratulation&mdash;believing, though we did not
know how, that a way of deliverance was opened
before us.</p>

<p>It was long before Sturdevant returned to us, so
long that we had despatched McCormick for a surgeon,
who had dressed Jasper's arm and departed before
the magistrate appeared. But we had not waited
in vain. I have not time to go into the detail of all
the particulars; for it is high time that the thread,
too long spun out, of this narrative should be snipped
off. But of course everybody whose memory (Heaven
pity them!) can extend back thirty years will remember
all about the story, which made a nine days'
wonder in this country, and a week's even in England.
Any one that will take the trouble to consult

<!-- v1 page 263 -->

a file of the London Times of that date will find all
the documents, letters, and affidavits, with the official
exoneration of Colonel Allerton, at full length.
As near as I remember them,&mdash;for my mind was
not entirely engrossed by them even at the time,&mdash;they
were substantially these:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ferguson, from his knowledge of that department
and of the parties likely to obtain relief from the government,
had planned this St. John forgery, and
several other lesser ones, and had found an apt instrument
in Mr. Aaron Abrahams. This gentleman
had transacted the American part of the business
more to the satisfaction of his employer than his own,
inasmuch as he did not think he was allowed his full
share of the booty. The communications between
them were carried on in cipher after the very beginning,
which was arranged when Ferguson was in New
York on a former visit undertaken for the purpose.
After the suspicions of Colonel Allerton had been excited,
Abrahams, who had received instant notice of
them from Ferguson, took himself out of the way until
the storm should blow over&mdash;this being undoubtedly
Ferguson's object when he advised a delay in communicating
the facts to the secretary. So effectually
had Abrahams done this, that Ferguson himself had
great difficulty in tracing him; for he seems to have
had no great confidence in his English confederate;
and it was not until his illness took him back to his
father's house that he fairly came up with him.</p>

<p>The object he had to gain was twofold: first, to

<!-- v1 page 264 -->

arrange Abrahams's testimony so that it should throw
the whole blame on Colonel Allerton; and, secondly,
to get possession of the letters in cipher, which contained
his instructions to his agent during the whole
transaction. In these laudable pursuits he had been
engaged for a day or two at such times as he could
have access to the sick man, and in these he was busy
when our opportune arrival interrupted him; and he
had succeeded so far as to induce Abrahams to produce
the letters (which he always kept with him) on
some pretence, but with the unquestionable purpose
of getting possession of them by force or fraud. When
the alarm was given of our arrival, and he actually
saw Markham and me, he snatched the documents
and made his escape as described by Jasper.</p>

<p>The principal difficulty Mr. Sturdevant had to contend
with on the part of the excellent invalid was to
persuade him on which side his interest lay. But it
being made clear that whatever hope of favor or reward
the case admitted of lay with us, he ingenuously
stated the whole matter, and gave the key to
the cipher, which made it perfectly clear as to where
the guilt rested. This he was the more willing to do
from his discontent with his principal, nothing allayed
by this last operation of his, which plainly was
intended to leave him without proof of any connection
between them.</p>

<p>Before we left the house Markham and I had the
satisfaction of shaking hands upon the entire success
of our expedition; and our satisfaction was increased

<!-- v1 page 265 -->

by knowing that the relief of our friends had been
greatly hastened by it. Although it was Mr. Sturdevant's
opinion and our own that such a web of
fraud and perjury could not have stood the test of an
English investigation, still it was much better to
avoid it with all its gossipings, and scandals, and
lifelong suspicions. Ferguson was committed to the
county jail to await the decision of the higher authorities
as to the jurisdiction to which his crime belonged;
while an officer was put into the Jew's house
to keep guard over Abrahams. We returned to the
inn, taking with us poor Jasper, who was not fit to be
removed farther for a few days.</p>

<p>My mind being now at liberty to dwell on my
own affairs without distraction, I was half frantic at
this delay, and felt that I must know how matters
stood between Eleanor Allerton and Markham or die.
Sometimes I hoped that things were not advanced as
far between them as I had feared. He certainly did
not seem inordinately happy; but then he was parted
from Eleanor. Then, again, I was quite sure that
he had had no letter from her. To be sure, it was
hard to hit us, as we always were on the wing; but I
think I could not have pardoned Eleanor, were she
my lady-love, had she not contrived to do it.</p>

<p>The suspense was intolerable. I was haunted by
a thousand insane imaginings. I was afraid I should
be taken ill, too; perhaps I should die, and never
see her again. And it was Markham himself that
relieved me from my distress at last. He it was that

<!-- v1 page 266 -->

proposed that I should be the messenger of our glad
tidings. He wished to wait on the spot until the
whole business in regard to Ferguson was settled.
"Is this a happy lover?" said I to myself; and I
felt a foolish sort of comfort as I said it. The only
difficulty was about poor Jasper; and this was settled
by McCormick agreeing to stay with him till he was
able to travel, and then to see him to New York,
and, if necessary, to Wensley.</p>

<p>Things being thus arranged, I did not suffer the
grass to grow under my feet. I set out at daybreak
the next morning, and got on to New York as fast as
men and horses, urged by money, and, I am afraid,
by Newark whips, could take me in those days.
But I did not reach the city till the next day. Fortunately,
the Fulton sailed that evening; and I was at
Providence about three o'clock the next afternoon.
I would not wait till the stage coaches could describe
the two sides of the triangle, but pushed on over the
base line, which I had just mathematics enough to
know must be less than the sum of the other two.
I spared neither money, pains, nor horse flesh, and
hurried on across the country to Wensley. I had to
stop over night at Wexboro'; but, early the next
day, I was on my hot way again. I came in sight of
Wensley about eleven o'clock in the morning of a
delicious Indian-summer day. The haze, that was
not a haze, gave a dreamy beauty to tree, and hill,
and stream. At the gate I leaped out of the open
wagon which had brought me my last stage and hastened

<!-- v1 page 267 -->

up the sweep. I entered the house. I passed
on to Eleanor's parlor. I opened the door. She
was sitting at the farther window, and alone. When
she saw me she started up and exclaimed only,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Frank!"</p>

<p>"Eleanor&mdash;dear Eleanor," said I, "all is well!
Everything is cleared up, and all is safe!"</p>

<p>I had nearly crossed the room before I had finished
my sentence. She gave me a look never to be
forgotten; and, coming forward a step or two to
meet me, fell upon my neck and burst into tears.
Aha! it was not Fairy's neck this time. It was my
turn now. And <i>these</i> were tears of joy.</p>

<p>Presently I led her to the sofa, and, still holding
her hand (she let me, by Heaven!), told her as briefly
as I could the whole story. When this was done,
and we paused a moment from the subject, I looked
into her eyes (how could I have ever thought them
hard to read?) and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eleanor, then it was not Markham, after all?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, her lip quivering and her eyelids
drooping under my gaze; "no, Frank; it was not
Markham."</p>

<p>Ah, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Walter Scott, it was well
for your peace of mind that you were not within eyeshot
just then!</p>

<!-- v1 page 268 -->

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">BEING THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE is really no occasion for this chapter.
The little more I have to say could be stitched
on to the last one just as well as not. But, then, I
do think that chapter ends well; and, moreover, I
would not have this story of mine rounded by a
<i>thirteenth</i> chapter. No, indeed; I would as soon
have had thirteen guests round my wedding supper
table. So we will have chapter fourteen as <i>L' Envoi</i>,
if only for luck.</p>

<p>Well, well, it seemed a good while before that
marriage supper was spread. But, it came at last.
And it has been a good while longer since, only it
has not seemed so. Not that we had any very cruel
opposition to encounter. Had I been writing a novel
I should have been a dunce to have allowed Eleanor
to have had so good-natured a papa. But I cannot
help the fact; and in real life such characters are
not uncommon, and by no means unpleasant, if uninteresting.
Colonel Allerton only laughed at us, and
refused to recognize any engagement for a year or
two, thinking that it was only right a boy and girl
of nineteen (for I found that I had imagined Eleanor

<!-- v1 page 269 -->

older than she was, as boys are apt to do in such
cases, and that I was, in fact, just eleven days her
elder) should have a full opportunity to change their
minds. But as he allowed us perfect freedom of intercourse
personally and by letter, we consoled ourselves
by resolving to show him that we could not
change our minds. At any rate, we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. Bulkley was, of course, the first person out of
that family to whom I communicated all the good
news I had to tell, withholding nothing. The whole
story gave him the extremest pleasure, but none so
exquisite as the part which told that I was the accepted
lover of Eleanor. His joy was not profuse of
words; but it glistened in his eye, and seemed to pervade
his whole nature and to glow in his whole life.
I believe he loved us both dearly, and rejoiced from
his heart that we loved each other. And then a constitutional
match maker feels an artist's pride in the
match he has planned and help to make.</p>

<p>I thought he would be more distressed than he
seemed to be at Jasper's mishap. But he treated it
very slightly. He seemed still to hold to General
Wolfe's doctrine, that it was the business of a soldier
to die; and, of course, that includes being wounded.
Only he was glad that he had done his duty and
been mentioned with distinction in the despatches.
This was also very much Jasper's own opinion, when
he arrived soon after in the company rather than in
the care of the good McCormick, who came on with
him to see the Allertons, at their earnest request and

<!-- v1 page 270 -->

at their charges. Major Grimes told me Jasper said
"that a fellow that made a campaign in the Jarseys
must be willing to run the risk of being stuck by a
Tory." As the story was told to me, the future state
of the Tory was somewhat distinctly intimated. But,
as Jasper had lived so many years in a minister's service,
I cannot but hope that the qualifying participle
was an interpolation of the gallant narrator.</p>

<p>The remainder of my exile from college soon
passed away, and I returned thither with much more
reluctance than I had left it; and I returned much
older in heart and mind. I was a boy then; I felt
that I was a man now. My pursuits were modified
by the change in my feelings; and, if I did not
absolutely forsake the Deipnosophoi (which would
have been ungrateful in view of my obligations to
them), at least their ritual services absorbed a very
small part of my thoughts or my time. Encouraged
by the hope of showing myself worthy of the love
of Eleanor and of the good opinion of her father
and Mr. Bulkley, I gave myself to study as I had
never done before; and I believe that, when I came
to take my degree, I neither disgraced myself nor
disappointed them.</p>

<p>Within a year after my graduation, having then
attained my majority, Mr. Bulkley joined Eleanor
and me in holy wedlock at Wensley. It was an occasion
of mixed joy and sorrow, of smiles and tears,
as all such momentous crises must be to those that
reflect and feel. The greatest grief that clouded that

<!-- v1 page 271 -->

happy hour was the thought that it foreshadowed
the sad hour of separation from Mr. Bulkley and
Wensley; for, almost immediately after our marriage,
we accompanied Colonel Allerton back to England,
where we lived until his death, which occurred about
three years afterwards. There our friendly relations
were renewed with Markham, who had returned home
almost immediately after the events of the last chapter
and succeeded to the office left vacant by the dismission
of Ferguson, which he held until it expired,
not long since, with the gradual extinction of the
unfortunate class it regarded. I never knew what
passed between Eleanor and him at the time of his
visit at Woodside. I never asked her, and she never
told me.</p>

<p>After the death of her father, Eleanor and I returned
to America and lived a year or two at Wensley.
But the climate of New England did not agree
with her health; and we removed to Pennsylvania,
where we live to this day. Our house stands finely
on a spur of one of the Appalachians, just where the
mountain range begins to melt into the champaign
country below. Behind us the mountains stand in
everlasting yet ever-changing beauty; while, before,
the rushing river foams and flows through a delicious
country of meadows, pastures, cornfields, and woodlands,
dotted with cattle and sprinkled with villages,
until it is lost to sight in the blue distance. It is
situated in the township of St. Philipsburgh and the
county of Monongahela, about three miles off the

<!-- v1 page 272 -->

state road from Harrodstown to Foxley, to the west.
There we have lived for many years and have had&mdash;&mdash;but
as Miss Martha Buskbody said to Mr. Peter Pattieson,
when he was about to make a minute statement
of the felicities of the married life of Henry Morton
and Edith Bellenden, "It is unnecessary to be particular
concerning our matrimonial comforts."</p>

<p>As long as Mr. Bulkley lived we never failed to
pay him a visit of two or three months every summer,
and for that purpose retained Woodside until
after his death. This took place about twelve years
from the time of our marriage, at the age, as the
inscription on the monument erected by the Wensley
Sewing Circle informs us, of eighty-four years, seven
months, and five days. It was, as he had always
wished it should be, instantaneous. I chanced to be
in New York when it happened; so that I was able
to reach Wensley in time to lay his head in the Minister's
Tomb. Eleanor mourned him as another father,
and I as the only one I had known. He left a moderate
property, as he had had a captain's pay for several
years under the last pension act. This he left to
the town, the income to be paid to Jasper during his
life. His books he bequeathed to me; also his sword
and firelock, which, as I write, are crossed over the
fireplace of my library as they were over his. His
cocked hat, wig, and gold-headed cane I bought at the
executor's sale at a moderate figure, and still preserve
them with filial reverence.</p>

<p>Jasper survived his master nearly ten years, and

<!-- v1 page 273 -->

was a good deal past ninety when he died. He was
"a prosperous gentleman" in his last days; for,
besides Mr. Bulkley's bequest, he had savings of his
own, as he was a pensioner under the first act, and
received his ninety dollars a year till his death. He
suffered me to give him the use of a cottage near the
borders of a pretty little wooded lake, which is
known as Jasp's Pond to this day. I was never in
Boston without going to see him; and, though I
was at home when he died, I honored his memory
with a marble headstone, according to a promise
made to him during life, and which seemed to reconcile
him more than anything to the idea of dying. The
Minister's Tomb is in the north-east corner of
the burying-ground, and Jasper lies buried a little to the
west and south of it. You would know the place by
a fine larch which grows near it.</p>

<p>I have been so busy with the memories I most love
that I had almost forgotten to tell what became of
Ferguson. After the first joy of the discovery of his
villany was over, I could see plainly that the minister
was depressed by the idea of his undergoing any
shameful punishment. I mentioned this to Colonel
Allerton; and he, too, felt no disposition to pursue
him to extremities. This he intimated to Mr. Sturdevant,
who informed him that he should promote his
wishes the more readily from the great doubt he entertained
whether Ferguson could be prosecuted to conviction.
He could not be sent to England for trial;
and it was more than doubtful whether the original

<!-- v1 page 274 -->

instigation of the crime, when in this country, could
be proved, after the death of Abrahams, which soon
followed the scenes at his bedside. So he was discharged
from custody by the consent of all parties.
His spirit was thoroughly broken, however, as may be
inferred from this fact. When the negotiations
relating to his release were going on, Mr. Sturdevant
received from Boston an anonymous letter, containing
a draft for five hundred dollars, to be given to the
prisoner on his discharge. This he must have supposed
to have come from Colonel Allerton, the man
he had tried to ruin; and yet he took it. <i>We</i> knew
that it was an offering to the memory of Julia Mansfield.
Ferguson went to South America, where the
revolutions were then raging, and nothing definite
was ever heard of him. If the rumors which reached
us were true, his life and death were miserable
enough.</p>

<p>And now I do wish to Heaven that I had the least
spice of invention in my whole composition. I
always thought that these facts, simple and natural
as they are, were capable of artistic treatment in
proper hands. And here I have bungled the whole
thing, because all I could do was to tell them in the
order in which they occurred. I had not the least
intention of saying anything about myself or my
concerns, except with respect to Parson Bulkley and
Jasper, when I began. And yet I have told you this
long story, of which, after all, I seem to have blundered
into being the hero much against my will.

<!-- v1 page 275 -->

But I could not help myself; I could not arrange
and improve my incidents. All that I can claim is
the humble virtue of strict and literal fidelity in my
narrative of facts. I believe the faculty of imagination
was left out when I was put together.</p>

<p>Then, again, I wonder whether this <i>is</i> "A STORY
WITHOUT A MORAL" or not. I am sure I did not
mean that it should have any. I have been taken in
so often by false pretences, and found that I had
bought a tract against Catholicism or against Protestantism,
in favor of free trade or of protection, of
high church or low church, when I thought I had
been buying a novel, that I was determined, when asked
by my intrepid publishers to furnish something
for their press, that it should be something not in the
remotest degree edifying or instructive. I don't
know how I have succeeded; but I have done my
best. I was horribly afraid, however, when I first
saw the name in print, that it might turn out, after
all, a "MORAL WITHOUT A STORY." But I don't think
it has. The only moral I can discern in it is, that,
if a young gentleman gets into a row and is
sent away from college, he will be rewarded with the
most charming of young women as a wife. But I
really think this is too violent a generalization; and I
would earnestly entreat the academic youth of America
not to act upon it as a settled principle. If my story
have any moral, it is because one is the inevitable
attendant upon all the events of human life. I will
only say, at parting, that I shall be amply rewarded

<!-- v1 page 276 -->

for my pains in telling it if I have succeeded in
exciting for a brief moment in the minds of my
readers a portion of the interest and pleasure which
is ever renewed in my own breast by the name of

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>I had my grandfather, Josiah Quincy, jun., in mind, as the
<i>motive</i> of the description of Mr. Langdon. This story has a ground-work
of historical truth. There was such an insurrection in 1739,
in South Carolina.]</p>

<p>IT was towards the close of an April day (how different
from those he had left behind him!) in the
year 1773, that a gentleman of some political prominence
in the town of Boston found himself riding
up the approach to Mount Verney,&mdash;an estate lying
in one of the midland counties of South Carolina.
The visit of Mr. Langdon (by which name it is our
sovereign pleasure that our traveller shall be known)
to the Southern Colonies was partly of a personal,
and partly of a political nature. His physicians had
doomed him to expiate his intemperate excesses of
study and professional application by some months

<!-- v1 page 280 -->

of exile from New England; and the stirring character
of public affairs at that time induced him to
select the more important of the Southern provinces
as his place of banishment. The signs of an approaching
collision with the mother-country were too
plain to be mistaken; and Massachusetts Bay, as
the ringleader of the gathering revolt, was naturally
anxious to know to what extent the other Colonies
were ripe for the conflict, and how far she might
rely upon them for assistance in the last appeal.</p>

<p>It is no part of my purpose to give any particulars
of his success or ill success in his demi-public capacity.
I will only say, that though his mission looked
towards "Disunion," and even towards the possible
contingency of "cutting their masters' throats," his
reception and treatment were very different from
that extended a year or two since by the same sovereignty,
to an accredited ambassador of Massachusetts,
who visited it for the purpose of instituting a
suit-at-law, before the tribunals of the nation, to
settle a question of personal liberty. Nor will I
embrace the opportunity, though a tempting one, to
remark upon the folly of the Northern provinces, even
at that early day, in reaching after the broken reed
of Southern alliance, which has from that time to
this only pierced the hand that leaned upon it for
support. My only object in giving these particulars
is to satisfy the constitutional craving of my countrymen,
which would not be content without a sufficient
explanation of the circumstance of my traveller being

<!-- v1 page 281 -->

in the avenue to Mount Verney on the day and year
I have indicated.</p>

<p>There he was, however, and, as he walked his tired
horse along the picturesque road that wound its way
up the side of the gentle hill upon which the house
stood, he could not help contrasting the scene and
the climate with what his native land was affording at
that moment. Though it was early in April, the luxuriance
of the vegetation put to shame the leafiest
summer of his colder clime. The sides of the hill he
was ascending were hung with tufted woods of the
tenderest green, stretching far away upon the plain.
Though the primeval forest was in some sort cleared
from the hillside by which the planter's mansion-house
was approached, still there were left clumps
of forest-trees and thickets of flowering shrubs, with
here and there a single tree of colossal dimensions,
which threw sharply defined shadows upon the brightest
and freshest of greenswards as the sun hastened
to his setting. Delicious perfumes, wafted from a
thousand blossoming trees and shrubs, and myriads
of birds of strange plumage and new song, and the
balmy sweetness of an atmosphere which it was luxury
to inhale, made the traveller feel that he was indeed
transported leagues away from his bleak native coast,
and borne nearer to the sun.</p>

<p>Following the windings of the road along the park-like
slope of the hill, Mr. Langdon at length drew
rein before the chief entrance of the mansion. It was
a building of no particular pretensions to architectural

<!-- v1 page 282 -->

beauty, excepting such as it might derive from its
adaptation to the climate. Deep piazzas, their slender
pillars garlanded with creeping plants of an ever-changing
variety of flower and fragrance, lent to the
lofty hall and spacious apartments a shade and coolness
deeply delicious. The rankness of the vegetation
gave to the grounds in which it stood a somewhat
untrimmed and neglected aspect; yet the place had
a distinguished air and a look of tropical elegance. It
seemed to be an abode where the mere pleasure of
animal existence, and the delights which dwell in the
senses, might be enjoyed in their highest poignancy.</p>

<p>The rare event of a visitor at Mount Verney was
soon made known by the clamorous uproar of an infinity
of dogs of every degree, and by a bustle, scarcely
more intelligent, of troops of curious negroes jostling
one another in their anxiety to see, under the pretence
of serving, the new arrival. The master of the house,
to the monotony of whose life any interruption would
have been a relief, hastened out to welcome his guest
with hospitable earnestness. He had heard that Mr.
Langdon was in Charleston, and had written to him
to beg him to take Mount Verney in his way. His
prominence among the disaffected of the Colony, his
intelligence, and his wealth, made Mr. Langdon think
it worth his while to accept the invitation, although
it took him somewhat out of his way. Mr. Verney
ushered him into the house, and heaped upon him
every hospitable attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Verney was a bachelor of some forty years,

<!-- v1 page 283 -->

"or by'r lady" inclining to five and forty. He lived
alone with his slaves, without the solace or the care
of female society. Like most men of such habits of
life, he had an older look than belonged to his years,
and there was, besides, that indefinable air about him,
which gives one an instinctive consciousness that he
who wears it is not a happy man, that melancholy
and depression are his abiding guests. But, though
these fiends might not be far remote, they were certainly
exorcised for a season by the magic of exciting
and intelligent companionship. He was all
animation and festivity of spirits under the stimulus
of the congenial society of a man fresh from the
world of life and action. He was full of questioning
curiosity about that world from which he chose to
live remote, and seemed to relish the rare luxury
of conversation with all the keenness which long
abstinence could give.</p>

<p>The evening wore away in various talk, for which
their common friends at Charleston, the newest gossip
of the town, and the latest public news, afforded
topics enough and to spare. Supper-time came, and
they were ushered by a sable seneschal into the
dining-room, the size of which was curiously disproportioned
to the number of the party. The appointments
of the table indicated the wealth of the host
in the affluence of plate and china they displayed.
The viands were rather barbaric in their profusion,
perhaps, than <i>recherch&eacute;</i> in their preparation; but they
were none the less welcome to a hungry traveller.

<!-- v1 page 284 -->

This repast, in those days and latitudes, was the
principal meal of the day. The chase and other
sylvan sports, which formed the chief business of the
planters, furnished their tables with every variety of
game. The yet unexhausted soil yielded, almost
without labor, the choicest vegetables and fruits.
The "murdered land" had not as yet begun to haunt
its assassins with the spectres of poverty and want.
Those were the golden days of Carolina.</p>

<p>The repast was accompanied and succeeded by
flowing cups. The cellar of Mount Verney was bid
to yield up its most treasured stores in honor of
this hospitable occasion. Punch, too, the most
seductive and deceitful of beverages, was there in a
brimming bowl of the daintiest of china,&mdash;a libation
with which that generation welcomed, speeded, and
crowned the business of every day. Neither the
health nor the habits, however, of Mr. Langdon permitting
the indulgence which was the approved
custom of that day, the circulation of the bottle and
the bowl was made to give place to animated discourse,
which was prolonged late into the night.</p>

<p>As the large hours began to melt into the smaller
ones, they gradually concentrated their discourse on
the serious temper of the times and the portentous
events which seemed impending. The probabilities
of an actual contest with England, and its chances, if
it could not be avoided, were fully discussed. The
weight of the several Colonies in the scale of battle,
should battle come, was considered and calculated,&mdash;which

<!-- v1 page 285 -->

could be relied upon as firm in the faith,
which were wavering, which strong, and which weak,
in the prospect of the coming struggle. Mr. Verney
did not hesitate to indicate the radical weakness of
the Southern Colonies.</p>

<p>"Our slaves," said he, "will be a continual drag
upon us. The British will forever have an army of
observation, and of occupation too, if opportunity
serves, in the very heart of our country, cantoned
about in all of our houses, and quartered upon our
estates."</p>

<p>"You do not think, then, that the slaves are to be
depended upon, in case of an invasion?"</p>

<p>"Depended upon! Were slaves ever, since history
was, to be depended upon when they had a
chance to be even with their masters? Yes, they
may be depended upon for our deadliest and bloodiest
enemies."</p>

<p>"I cannot but think," replied Mr. Langdon, "that
you do not take sufficiently into consideration the
force of long habits of obedience, and the personal
affection of the slaves for their masters."</p>

<p>"Their personal affection for their masters! My
dear sir, had you lived your life among slaves, as I
have done, you would know what reliance to put on
that head! God knows that I have had an experience
against which no theory and no philosophy can
stand." And as he spoke a deep shade of melancholy
clouded his features.</p>

<p>After a pause Mr. Langdon proceeded, "What

<!-- v1 page 286 -->

you say is an argument fatal to the defence of your
slavery. It shows it to be incompatible with the
existence, or at least the safety, of any commonwealth
where it is permitted."</p>

<p>"To be sure it is!" replied Mr. Verney. "None
but a fool or a villain would attempt to defend it on
its merits. But what are we to do? We have the
wolf by the ears, and we can neither keep him, nor
let him go."</p>

<p>"It is hard to say, indeed," said Mr. Langdon.
"But could you not first tame your wolf, and then
let him go? A wolf may be tamed: a negro may
be civilized. Educate your slaves, prepare them for
freedom, and then there can be no danger in giving
it to them. Does not a wise foresight point this out
as the only feasible precaution against consequences
terrible to think of?"</p>

<p>"My friend," replied his host, in a voice agitated
by strong emotion, "you talk of you know not what.
Relax your hold upon the wolf, as you must if you
would tame him, and he will bury his fangs in your
vitals for your pains. No, no! such an attempt
would be full of ruin. My whole life has been but
too bitter a commentary on your philosophy. God
forbid that the curse of an unreasoning philanthropy
be visited upon other innocent heads!"</p>

<p>Mr. Langdon saw that his new friend was deeply
moved by some uncontrollable emotion. He knew
nothing of his history, and consequently could not
divine its cause. He felt a strong curiosity to know

<!-- v1 page 287 -->

what it was; but politeness, and a sense of what was
due to the evident mental sufferings of his host,
forbade any expression of it. He accordingly waited
in silence.</p>

<p>After a short pause, Mr. Verney recovered his equanimity,
and, turning to his guest, said, "But I ought
to apologize for keeping a tired traveller so long
from his rest. Shall I show you your chamber?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langdon assented, and, following his host, was
ushered into his apartment.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The room into which Mr. Verney conducted his
guest was on the same floor with the dining-room
and parlors, as they were called in those days, before
drawing-rooms. It had the look of having been
intended, and of having been formerly used, for the
reception of company. The furniture, though evidently
of an age anterior to that of the inhabited part
of the house, was of a style and description better
befitting what our ancestors used to call a "day-room"
than a bed-chamber. The height and size of
the room, however, made it a very fit place for the
invocation of slumber in the climate of Carolina.
A journey of thirty or forty miles on horseback gave
it a very inviting air to the tired traveller, and he
thought he had seldom seen a more tempting object
than the ample and luxurious bed, to be ascended
only by a pair of steps, which reared itself in one
corner, as if the appointed altar of Morpheus himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Verney shook hands with his guest at the

<!-- v1 page 288 -->

door, and, wishing him a good-night, left him to his
repose. Mr. Langdon was too tired and sleepy to
take much notice of anything the room contained,
excepting his couch; but he could not help observing,
as he was undressing, two large portraits, nearly
full-lengths, of the size of life, which occupied corresponding
panels on the side of the room opposite
to the bed. The one nearest the bed was of a gentle
man in the dress of the days of Queen Anne, or of
George the First, his dark intelligent face looking
out from the fullest of full-bottomed wigs; and the
other, of a lady in a fancy dress, which made it more
uncertain as to the age in which so charming a
shepherdess had predominated over the two sheep
which seemed to make up her flock. Mr. Langdon
took but a hurried glance at them as they looked
down upon him from their elaborately carved frames
of tarnished gold. He bestowed one wondering
thought upon them as he climbed up to his repose,
marvelling that two old family portraits of the apparent
consequence of these pictures, were suffered
to hang neglected in a place where they must be so
little seen. But sleep soon banished all thought of
his neighbor's affairs, or of his own, from his mind.</p>

<p>It was broad day the next morning when he
awoke (for early rising was not one of the vices of
Mount Verney), and, when he looked at the pictures
again in the light of the sun, he felt yet more surprised
than he had done the night before, to think
that they should be relegated to a remote bed-chamber.

<!-- v1 page 289 -->

He was no connoisseur, as he had had few
opportunities of seeing good pictures; but a correct
natural taste, assisted by personal intimacy with
Copley (then in the prime of his genius), and familiarity
with his works, made him sensible that they
were paintings of no common merit. Especially in
the picture of the gentleman did he think he perceived
the hand of a master. Upon taking a more minute
survey of his apartment, his surprise was yet further
increased by the discovery of a picture opposite to
these, of three beautiful children&mdash;two boys and a
girl; the boys, apparently, from seven to ten years
old, drawing the little girl, of four or five, in a
garden carriage, or rather the elder drawing, and
the younger pushing it from behind&mdash;in all the
glee and romping spirits of childhood. There was a
quaintness about the look of the children, dressed,
according to the fashion of that day, in the costume
of men in miniature, that struck Mr. Langdon, whose
passion was children, even more than the elder
portraits.</p>

<p>After breakfast, by Mr. Verney's invitation, he rode
with him the rounds of his extensive plantation.
He inspected the fields of rice and of indigo, on which
depended the profits of the proprietor, and surveyed
the plantations of Indian corn, yams, sweet-potatoes,
and other esculent vegetables for the support of
the negroes and the supply of the great house. He
visited "the quarter" where the slaves lived, and
saw how slavery looked in the shape of womanhood,

<!-- v1 page 290 -->

of worn-out old age, and of childhood, more hopeless
and melancholy than old age itself. Although the
arrangements for the slaves were as good, or better,
than he had seen on the other plantations he
had visited, still there was that about the home that
was no home,&mdash;sordid, cheerless, melancholy,&mdash;of
the negroes, that struck a deeper horror of the
system through the veins of the stranger than all
the burning toils of the field. The gardens and
grounds about the house were viewed the last. At
each stage of their excursion, the economy of a great
plantation was explained and illustrated by Mr.
Verney, whose strong native sense, joined to his long
experience, eminently qualified him for such a lecture.</p>

<p>The ride occupied the chief of the morning, and
dinner was announced soon after their return home.
As they were sitting over their wine, after dinner,
it was next to impossible that they should talk of
anything but slaves and slavery. Mr. Langdon had
a natural abhorrence of the system, which was not at
all diminished by what his own eyes had seen of it.
His zeal for liberty was a principle universal in its
nature and in its application, and he was deeply
sensible of the disgraceful inconsistency of a contest
for freedom carried on by the masters of slaves, and
trembled lest this element might prove fatal to the
whole movement. Mr. Verney assented to all his
general principles, and had nothing to say against his
deductions from them.</p>

<p>"What you say, my friend, is all unquestionably

<!-- v1 page 291 -->

true. But here are we, and there are the slaves, and
what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you what you may <i>not</i> do, if you
really wish to be rid of this horrid curse, and that
is&mdash;<i>nothing</i>. You are in the mire, I admit; but
you can only get out of it by putting your shoulder
to the wheel, and, the sooner you begin, the better
for you."</p>

<p>"It is easier to say that something must be done
than to say what that something should be. We find
ourselves bound up with the blacks in this infernal
spell, and how to break it passes my art, I must
confess."</p>

<p>"Were it not," replied Mr. Lagdon, with some
hesitation, "that the suggestion last night seemed to
give you pain, I should insist on what I then said,
that you cannot expect your slaves ever to be in a
condition to receive their liberty, unless you begin
to put them in a condition to receive it. Pardon
me," he continued, seeing a cloud again begin to
brood over the brow of his friend,&mdash;"pardon me, if
there be anything painful or improper in what I have
said; for you must know that I can have no design
to give you pain."</p>

<p>"There can be nothing improper," Mr. Verney
replied, "in so natural a suggestion as yours; but I
will not affect to deny that it is painful, deeply painful,
to me. If I have reason to know anything on
earth, it surely is the fallacy of your proposition.
It does indeed touch me nearly."</p>

<!-- v1 page 292 -->

<p>Observing Mr. Langdon looked concerned and interested,
he proceeded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see that you are curious to know what all this
means, and, having raised your curiosity, it is no
more than right that I should gratify it, though it be
a task that I would willingly decline."</p>

<p>Then, silencing with a hasty gesture a polite attempt
on the part of his guest to waive the subject, he
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, what I have to tell is no secret: it is part
of the history of the Colony. And it is a weakness
in me to shrink from what I am liable to hear of, and
do actually hear of, from almost everyone (but that
is not a great many) that comes to see me. Did
you observe anything in particular in your bed-chamber
last night or this morning?"</p>

<p>"You can hardly think me so blind," replied Mr.
Langdon, hoping that here was an opportunity of
saving his host from an unpleasant personal narrative,
"as not to have observed and admired the admirable
family pictures that hang there. I only
wondered at their being there instead of here or in
the hall. By whom, pray, were they painted?"</p>

<p>"They are what I meant," said Mr. Verney, with
a forced calmness eloquent of deep emotion. "They
are all that remain to me of my house, once an
honored one in two countries,&mdash;my father, my
mother, my brothers, and my sister, all united in one
horrible destruction, and I left alone, of the happiest
of households, the last of my name and race. You

<!-- v1 page 293 -->

can hardly wonder, my friend, that I do not choose
to have such mementos always before my eyes.
You will wonder the less when I shall have told
you of their fate."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I shall give the substance of Mr. Verney's narrative,
as it remains among the papers of his guest, in
my own words, for the sake of the succinctness and
brevity which the inexorable limits of this volume
demand. I believe that I have omitted nothing
material to the story, though I have left out many
conversational digressions, and explanations of the
way in which the narrator obtained his knowledge
of incidents which did not come under his personal
observation. I only hope, that, in laboring to be
brief, I may not become obscure.</p>

<p>Colonel Verney, the father of our acquaintance,
was the grandson of the first emigrant of the family
to the New World. His grandfather was a French
Huguenot, of a noble family, who was one of the multitudes
dragooned out of his native country after the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The Vicomte du
Verneuil and his ancestors had always been among
the pillars of the Protestant faith in France. Their
blood had helped swell the orgies of the feast of St.
Bartholomew, and had been poured out on almost
every battlefield during the long wars of religious
ascendency. For the century, nearly, that the Edict
of Nantes remained in force, they were always active
in the intestine broils which disturbed the reign of

<!-- v1 page 294 -->

Louis XIII. and the minority of his successor, and
in the later intrigues which gave to religious bigotry
the air of statesmanship, in the act which expelled
half a million of the best subjects of France from
her soil. The representative of this turbulent house,
therefore, had no claim for exemption, had he wished
it, from the common fate of his faith.</p>

<p>M. du Verneuil first took refuge in England. He
was kindly received, as were all his unfortunate
countrymen who escaped thither. But his very
superiority in point of rank made his position more
irksome to him than the humbler artisans, who easily
obtained employment, and melted into the mass of
the laboring population, found theirs to be. He had
brought away with him a remnant of his property,
which, though relatively large, was very inadequate
to support him and his family in the style they
deemed essential to their dignity. He was soon
obliged to cast about for some mode of living which
would save his pride and his dwindling estate at the
same time.</p>

<p>About this period, public attention in England was
strongly directed towards the proprietary Colony of
Carolina. The noble proprietaries were endeavoring
to revive on those distant shores the decaying feudality
of the Old World. They had called philosophy
to their aid, and, in making John Locke the
Lycurgus of their infant realm, the fantastic spirit
of Shaftesbury thought they had imitated the wisdom
of the ancients, who made their philosophers

<!-- v1 page 295 -->

their lawgivers. But the experiment redounded as
little to the credit of philosophy, as the incorporation
of negro slavery with the institutions he ordained
did to the honor of the philosopher. But at the first
establishment of the constitutions of Carolina, their
defects were not developed, and their fanciful structure
attracted more general attention, doubtless, than
a more rational plan would have done. But there
was one great want yet to be supplied. Palatines,
landgraves, and caciques, chancellors, chamberlains,
and admirals, there were good store; but the proprietaries
sadly lacked common people over whom these
dignitaries were to predominate. Accordingly, they
did their best to promote emigration by every means
in their power.</p>

<p>The tide of industrious and worthy emigrants
which now flowed from France came very opportunely
for them, and they endeavored, with success,
to direct it in part towards their new Colony. The
names of many of the principal families in Carolina&mdash;Manigault,
Petigru, Legare, Gaillard, DeSaussure&mdash;still
bear witness to that great emigration to her
shores, as the names of Bethune, Revere, Deblois,
Amory, Bowdoin, Faneuil, and many others, testify
to our own share in it. M. du Verneuil, as a man
of some property, was a very desirable recruit. His
attention was drawn to this Eldorado of the West by
the Earl of Berkeley, and all its real and imaginary
advantages set forth in golden phrase. It seemed to
be what he wanted, and he was easily persuaded to

<!-- v1 page 296 -->

embark himself, and all the fortunes of his house, in
the hazardous adventure. He set sail for the New
World, and arrived with his wife and only child, a
youth of about sixteen, at Charleston, in November,
1686.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that his golden expectations
were disappointed. He found a scene as different
from that whence he came, as can well be imagined.
But with the elasticity of spirit, and power of adaptation,
of his nation, he soon conformed himself to
his new circumstances, and became one of the most
prominent men in the rising Commonwealth. Madame
de Verneuil died soon after their arrival in the
Colony, having sunk under the strange hardships and
discomforts of her new lot; but his son, the grandfather
of Mr. Langdon's host, took kindly to his
adopted country, and throve apace in it. He married
early, and established himself, after his father's death,
at Mount Verney, then on the frontiers of the province.
His name, the pronunciation of which had
long been an offence to English tongues, was finally
corrupted, and Anglicized into Verney, a change to
which he readily consented. As the Colony flourished,
he grew rich, and increased in goods, and like a patriarch,
as he was, he had gold and silver, men-servants
and maid-servants, and much cattle.</p>

<p>His contentment with his lot, however, did not
blind him to the disadvantages of his position for
the education of children. He accordingly sent his
only son at an early age to England, to receive his

<!-- v1 page 297 -->

education there. As his body-servant, and in some
sort his companion, he sent with him a young slave,
who had had charge of him from his earliest years.
Arnold, for so the slave was named, from his original
master, was not many years older than young Verney;
but he had shown a discretion and considerateness
so much beyond his years, and evinced so
genuine and tender an affection for his young charge,
that Mr. Verney was perfectly content still to intrust
the care of his personal safety and comfort to him.
Arnold, as well as his young master, looked forward
with delight to the new and strange scenes in store
for them, and he felt a sense of trust and responsibility
which raised him sensibly in his own estimation.</p>

<p>To England they went early in the last century.
Young Verney, still accompanied by Arnold, proceeded
from Eton to Oxford, and from Oxford to the
Inns of Court. Wherever he went, Arnold was still
a prime favorite both with his master and his young
companions. His imperturbable good humor and
lightness of heart were a continual letter of recommendation,
while his sterling excellences of character
won for him genuine respect. He availed himself
of such snatches of instruction as he could seize
by the way, with such success, that it was a common
saying among Verney's companions, that Arnold
knew more than his master. However this might
be, he was singularly well instructed for one in his
condition of life, and might have passed muster very

<!-- v1 page 298 -->

creditably among persons of much higher pretensions
than he. In his zeal for knowledge, he was encouraged
and assisted by his young master, who seemed
to feel as if all the intelligence of his sable satellite
was but the reflected radiance of his own.</p>

<p>At length the time of return arrived, and some
where about 1720, Verney, accompanied by Arnold,
sailed for home. It was a great change for Verney&mdash;that
from the crowds and gayeties of London to the
solitude and monotony of his father's plantation.
But it was a yet greater change for poor Arnold, who
found himself transported from a land of freedom
to a land of slaves. The kindness with which he had
been uniformly treated, and the circumstance that in
England he was rather better treated than worse,
on account of his color, had almost made him forget
that he was a slave. His return to Carolina was to
him almost like a reduction from absolute freedom
to hopeless slavery. His eyes had been opened, and
he saw his own condition, and that of his race, in all
its horrors. The abominations, the cruelties, the
debasement, which necessarily attend upon slavery,
shocked him as they never could have done, had he
remained always surrounded by them. The thought
that he, too, was one of the victims appointed by
an inexorable fate to this dreadful destiny, filled
him with anguish and despair which could not be
uttered.</p>

<p>Gloom and despondency settled down upon his
soul. The change which had come over him was

<!-- v1 page 299 -->

obvious to all, and the old planter easily divined the
cause.</p>

<p>"You have spoiled that boy, Jack," said he to his
son: "you have made him above his business. You
had better let Jones put him into the field for a
while. There's nothing like hard work and flogging
to take the sulks out of a nigger."</p>

<p>His son, however, refused to take this humane
advice, and still kept Arnold about his person, as his
body-servant, contenting himself with forbidding him
the use of books and writing-materials. He prided
himself much upon his sagacity in devising this notable
remedy, when it appeared at last to be crowned
with success. After a long period of depression and
melancholy, the cloud seemed suddenly to pass off
from Arnold's countenance, and the weight to be removed
from his heart. He addressed himself to his
duties with all his former assiduity, if not with all
his old gayety of spirit. Had his master been an acute
physiognomist, he would have seen that the look out
of his eye, the air of his head, the carriage of his body,
were all different from what they were of old. But
he only observed that he was cured of the sulks, and
congratulated himself on his wise prescription of abstinence
from books and pen and ink.</p>

<p>But this change had deeper springs than the philosophy
of Verney dreamt of. It proceeded from the
reception of a great idea, the adoption of an absorbing
and abiding purpose for which to live. While he
was plunged in the depths of his despondency,&mdash;despairing

<!-- v1 page 300 -->

for himself and his race,&mdash;a thought
flashed into his darkened mind, and illuminated its
gloomiest recesses.</p>

<p>"Why," thought he, "are my people and myself
slaves? Why do we remain slaves? Is there, in
deed, no remedy? Is it a necessity, that when we
outnumber our tyrants four to one, and every one of
us is a match for four of them in strength,&mdash;is it a
necessity that we remain slaves forever?"</p>

<p>The thought nerved his mind anew. His gloom
passed away. He saw clearly the relative strength
of the masters and slaves. He remembered that the
Spaniards were at hand in Florida, ever ready to sow
dissension in the Colony, and to breed discontents
among the slaves. He felt that a blow might be
struck, which would give all the broad lands of Carolina
to those hands that extorted wealth from them
for others. He felt that a mind only was wanting to
watch and guide events in order to conduct such a
revolution to a triumphant issue. He was proudly
conscious that his was a mind capable of this great
task. He looked upon the advantages of education he
had enjoyed as something providential, and designed
for a mighty end. He saw himself the appointed
leader of his people in their exodus out of the land of
bondage. In his excitement of thought, he saw the
whole process of deliverance pass, as it were, before
his eyes, and he beheld his nation free and happy in
the homes they had wrested from their oppressors.
He accepted this natural operation of the mind as a

<!-- v1 page 301 -->

prophetic intimation of duty and revelation of success.
His destiny was fixed. He devoted himself to the
rescue of his miserable race. A deep calm brooded
over his soul. He was conscious to himself that he
was equal to the work he had undertaken, and he was
at peace. And he had yet another seal of his fitness
for his mission,&mdash;he was willing to wait.</p>

<p>Long years he waited; but the purpose of his
soul was fixed. The deliverance of his race became
the absorbing, the overwhelming passion of his being.
The degradation in which he saw them plunged, the
vices which were forced upon them, the barbarities
which they endured, made his life bitter to him, and
his only relief was in the distant hope of rescue and
retribution. His character was obviously changed;
but, under the quiet gravity with which he performed
his offices about his master's person, nothing was
suspected to lurk, except the desperate contentment
of a hopeless slave.</p>

<p>As time passed away, the usual changes which it
works were wrought in the condition of Colonel
Verney; for such was the rank which Arnold's
master held in the colonial establishment. Death,
marriage, and birth had bereaved and blessed him,
according to the common lot of man. He succeeded
his father in the possession of Mount Verney, he won
the chiefest of Carolinian beauties to share it with
him, and he was girt with growing infancy, the charm
of the present moment and the hope of future years.
His political position was eminent and influential.

<!-- v1 page 302 -->

His plantation was a mine of still increasing wealth.
He seemed to have nothing left to desire.</p>

<p>The public duties of Colonel Verney took him
regularly every winter to Charleston, and frequently
to various and distant parts of the Colony. On all
these expeditions he was attended by Arnold as his
body-servant. The opportunities which were thus
given to the restless observation of the slave to discern
the strength or the weakness of the different
portions of the province, and to select the disaffected
spirits among the servile population on whose cooperation
he could rely, were faithfully improved.
His manner of life, too, was eminently favorable for
watching the signs of the times, and for seizing the
moment which they should pronounce auspicious.
He bided his time in patience, well aware of the
momentous issues of the enterprise he revolved in
his mind, and determined not to endanger its success
by any premature or ill-considered action.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years had thus glided away since
Arnold first accepted what he considered a call to be
the deliverer of his people, and the favorable moment
had not yet appeared. At last the conjunction of
events seemed to portend the hour at hand. The
relations between England and Spain became every
day more and more disturbed. The aggressions of
Spain upon English commerce and English rights
were the favorite topics of one of the mightiest oppositions
that an English minister ever had to encounter.
Sir Robert Walpole lingered out with difficulty

<!-- v1 page 303 -->

his wise and pacific policy, with continually dwindling
majorities, against such antagonists as the elder
Pitt, Pulteney, Wyndham, and Lyttelton in the Commons,
and Bathurst, Carteret, and Chesterfield in the
Lords. But the public mind of England was at
fever-heat, burning for a Spanish war. It was obvious
that the only chance of the pilot at the helm
of state to retain his hold upon it was to shape his
course with the tide, whose current was too mighty
for him to resist. A Spanish war was inevitable.</p>

<p>The relations of the Colonies of Carolina and of
Florida were among the vexed questions which were
to be adjusted by the sword. The Colonies, in those
days, were ever the pawns of the royal chess-players
of Europe, the first to be moved, and the first to
suffer, as the "unequal game" of war proceeded.
The Spanish governor of Florida, Don Manuel de
Monteano, was a man that well understood the nature
of the move required of him. His theatre was a
narrow one; but he was an actor that gave dignity to
the boards he trod, and he was resolved to grace his
narrow stage with action worthy of the widest scene.
Long before affairs were ripe for war, he had been busy
in forecasting preparation for it. His emissaries had
been dispersed, in various disguises, over Carolina.
The relative strength of the whites and blacks, the
false security of the former, and the necessary disaffection
of the latter, were well known to him. He
had that greatest of gifts in the craft of government,&mdash;a
wise choice of instruments with which to work.</p>

<!-- v1 page 304 -->

<p>His most confidential agent was one Da Costa,
a Jew of Portuguese extraction, who fixed his head-quarters
in Charleston, where he lived unsuspected,
as a pawnbroker, and dealer in small wares. The
character of his traffic was such as brought him
without suspicion into constant communication with
the slaves, and gave him opportunities of judging
which were the fittest tools for his purposes. He
was too keen an observer not to single out Arnold,
at almost his first casual interview with him, as the
man of men for whom he had been long in search.
A short acquaintance made them thoroughly understand
each other, and they became of one mind and
of one heart in the work that lay before them. They
digested their plans; they assigned to each other and
to the few confederates they could trust the parts
they were to play. A general insurrection was to
be sustained by a Spanish invasion. The freedom of
the slaves was to be guaranteed, and the Colony was
to be governed by the blacks, as a dependency of
Spain. It was a good plot, well conceived and well
arranged, and there seemed to be no reason why it
should not succeed.</p>

<p>A part of Arnold's business was the encouragement
of an extensive system of evasion into Florida by
the slaves. This was done to such an extent that
one entire regiment of escaped slaves was mustered
into the service of his Catholic Majesty, armed,
equipped, and paid on the same footing with the
rest of the Spanish army, and officered by the picked

<!-- v1 page 305 -->

men of their own number. The Colonelcy of this
regiment was offered to Arnold; but he justly considered
that the post of danger and of honor in such
a perilous enterprise as this was in the heart of the
insurrection, and not at the head of the invasion. So
he voluntarily remained a slave,&mdash;though escape was
easy, and though freedom, distinction, rank, and equal
society were within his grasp,&mdash;that he might be
a more faithful and effectual servant of his injured
race.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the intimate relations
of Arnold with Da Costa, he was far from giving
him his entire confidence. He had no faith in the
abstract zeal of the Spaniards for human rights, and
he believed that their real purpose was only to substitute
Spanish for English masters. He foresaw
that his end could only be achieved by another servile
war, under much less favorable circumstances,
following upon the one impending, unless he could
guard against this danger. He meditated the subject
long and deeply; and his conclusion was one
that startled and dismayed himself. He could discern
but one way of permanent peace and safety for
the blacks; and that was the utter extermination
of the whites.</p>

<p>He could not escape from the terrible presence of
this dreadful necessity. His heart died within him
when it first stood revealed to his sight. It haunted
him by day and by night. It was almost enough
to stagger his resolution, and make him abandon his

<!-- v1 page 306 -->

design with horror. The images of his master,
the companion of his youth and the unalterably
kind friend of his manhood; of his mistress,
the beautiful, the gentle, and the good; of the generous
Arthur; of the frolic, mischief-loving Edward,
his especial pet; of the little Alice,&mdash;of all of
whom he was ever the chosen playfellow and bosom
friend&mdash;these phantoms made him quail for a
moment as they rose before his mental sight in that
fearful midnight when this ghastly idea first startled
him with its apparition. He had neither wife nor
child. All his affections centred with passionate
intenseness in his master and his children. They
were all he had to love. Was this terrible blood-offering
required at his hands? His own life he was
ready to pour out. He foreboded that he should not
survive the coming struggle. But must he sacrifice
lives infinitely dearer to him than his own? He
flung himself in an agony of despair upon his face,
and wept long and bitterly.</p>

<p>But presently a wail was borne upon the air
through the open casement, distant, but fearfully
distinct. It was the chosen hour for punishment.
He started to his feet. It was a woman's voice,
shrill and shrieking, that reached his ear from the
remote "quarter." It sounded like the "exceeding
bitter cry" of his race, whose wrongs he had forgotten,
reproaching him for his weakness. He thought
of their blood and tears crying to Heaven for
vengeance: a vision of chains and whips and branding-irons,

<!-- v1 page 307 -->

and an endless procession of enslaved
generations, rushed upon his soul. Was this great
deliverance to be wrought without the dearest sacrifice?
Was it to be purchased without a price? He
would not shrink from his part of it, dreadful as it
might be. But God grant that he might not survive
the victory it was to buy!</p>

<p>This necessity was felt by all the blacks who were
admitted into his confidence. It was agreed upon
that the massacre should be universal, and the future
exclusion of the white race from the province the
condition of its submission to the Spanish power.</p>

<p>Everything was ready. England and Spain were
at war. The Spanish auxiliaries were at hand. The
day approached&mdash;it arrived. It was a Sunday, and
one of the loveliest of autumnal days. Arnold repaired
early to the slave-quarter, and harangued the
slaves upon a case of surpassing cruelty they had
witnessed the night before. A tumult of excitement
was gathered around him. The alarm spread. Jones,
the iron-haired, iron-featured, and iron-hearted overseer,
approached, with two assistants, to suppress the
disturbance. Seeing Arnold, whom he hated because
beyond his usual authority, he rode up to him with
savage glee and uplifted whip. In a moment he was
stretched lifeless on the ground. His assistants met
with the same fate in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>The taste of blood and of revenge had been given,
and Arnold knew that the appetite would grow with
"what it fed on." He mounted the overseer's horse,

<!-- v1 page 308 -->

and, sending messengers to the neighboring plantations,
led the crowd of slaves towards the great
house. As they rounded the offices, and came in
sight of the house, Colonel Verney was seen hastily
approaching them. His commanding figure and military
bearing, acting upon their habit of subordination,
checked the progress of the slaves, and they stood indecisively
looking at him and at each other. Arnold
saw that this was the moment on which all would
depend. He rode in front of the confused crowd.</p>

<p>"Why, Arnold!" exclaimed his master, "what is
all this? How came you on Jones's horse? and what
means this disturbance?"</p>

<p>"It means, sir," answered Arnold,&mdash;"it means liberty
to slaves, and death to tyrants!"</p>

<p>"Tyrants, you rascal!" replied Colonel Verney.
"Dismount this instant, and I will soon thrash this
insolence out of you."</p>

<p>Arnold dismounted, and approached his master with
a firm step, while the gaping crowd stood awaiting
the issue. As soon as he was within reach, Colonel
Verney lifted his cane, and aimed a blow at his
slave's head. Arnold closed with him. In an instant
he had wrested the cane from his master's hand. A
slight motion made the scabbard fly far off upon the
lawn; the blade which it had concealed glittered in
the air for a moment, and in the next it was buried
deep in the heart he loved most on earth.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful slave!" exclaimed the dying man as
he fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<!-- v1 page 309 -->

<p>"No," replied Arnold, more to himself than to his
master. "A <i>slave</i> cannot be <i>ungrateful</i>."</p>

<p>I state facts: I do not propose examples. As an
historian I tell the doom which slavery once brought
upon its victim tyrants. As an abolitionist I show
the only method by which such horrors may be averted.
But let no one who boasts of blood shed in the
battles of freedom affect a horror at such scenes as I
have described. If ever blood was spilt righteously
for the vindication of rights or the redress of wrongs,
that which has flowed in servile insurrection is the
most hallowed of all. And let no one whose classic
enthusiasm kindles at the story of a Brutus or a Timoleon,
whose love of country and of freedom was too
mighty for the ties of sonship or brotherhood to hold
them back from imagined duty, brand as foul and
unnatural murder the sacrificial act of Arnold the
slave.</p>

<p>The blow was decisive: it turned the tide of feeling
at once. The negroes rushed forward with shouts
of triumph, over the dead body of their master,
towards the house. Arnold checked them, and found
them willing to listen to his directions. He hastily
told them that they must make all speed towards
Stono, a small settlement about five miles off, where
there was a warehouse full of arms and ammunition.
Ten were detailed for the bloody business to be despatched
at Mount Verney, under command of the only
confederate Arnold had on the plantation,&mdash;one whom
he could rely upon to see that there was no superfluous

<!-- v1 page 310 -->

cruelty committed. All the rest, following Arnold,
who had remounted his horse, hurried in the direction
he had indicated.</p>

<p>As they hastened along the high road, they were
continually re-enforced by parties from the neighboring
plantations, so that, by the time they reached Stono,
they were four or five hundred strong. The little
settlement was soon carried and sacked, every white
put to death, and a large supply of muskets and cartridges
secured. Arnold now called a halt and reduced
his promiscuous multitude to something like order.
The guns and ammunition he distributed, as far as
they would go, among those of his followers on whom
he could most depend. The rest were armed with
axes, scythes, clubs, or whatever other weapons their
hands could find. A quantity of white cloth furnished
them with banners. Drums and fifes were also in the
warehouse, and musicians are never wanting where
Africans are to be found. Arnold knew human nature
too well not to avail himself of these appliances.
So they took up their march towards Jacksonburgh,
with drums beating and banners flying, in some show
of military order.</p>

<p>Long before this, the tragedy was over at Mount
Verney. The party to whom it was confided did
their work quickly and thoroughly. I will not harrow
up the hearts of my readers, nor my own, by the
details which my materials afford. Humanity naturally
revolts at the horrors of slavery, whether they
are administered by the masters or by the slaves,

<!-- v1 page 311 -->

according as the one or the other have the power in
their hands. It is enough to say that Mr. Langdon's
host, then a child of six years old, was the only white
left alive in the house. And his escape was owing to
the affection and presence of mind of his nurse, who
by affecting zeal in the work, and pretending to despatch
this part of it herself, managed to deceive the
destroyers until they had left the bloody scene, and
hastened after the main body of the insurgents. The
terror of the child might well extend its influences
over the whole of life. The ghastly spectacles which
blasted his infant sight when he was released from
his hiding-place changed the current and the complexion
of his being. He was thenceforth what these
cruel calamities had made him. Such a cloud passes
not away with the morning of life, but sheds its baleful
shadow over its noontide and its evening hours.</p>

<p>Meantime the insurgent force moved successfully
on towards their destination. They destroyed every
house on their way, and put every white person they
met to death. Unfortunately for them, they found
abundance of liquor in the houses they sacked. Their
chief in vain urged upon them the necessity of entire
sobriety for their safety and success. The temptation
was too strong to be resisted, and Arnold saw with
dismay an element of failure developing itself, on
which he had not counted. He hurried them on, in
hopes of engaging them in some active service before
they became unfit for it. Presently a small party of
gentlemen were seen riding rapidly towards them.

<!-- v1 page 312 -->

They stopped suddenly on perceiving the strange
sight before them, and anxiously reconnoitred the
armed mass. Arnold at once recognized in the chief
of the party Governor Bull, with whose person he was
familiar. The Governor saw the whole truth in a
moment, and, wheeling about, galloped off with his
companions in the opposite direction. Arnold, who
had retained his horse for such an emergency as this,
pursued them at full speed, accompanied by a few
other mounted slaves. They fired upon the flying
horsemen, but without effect, and were soon obliged
to give over the pursuit, as the Governor and his
company were much better mounted than they. Here
was another untoward occurrence, ominous of ill
success.</p>

<p>A large congregation was assembled at the little
village of Wiltown, in the Presbyterian church, to
hear the famous Mr. Archibald Stobo preach. The
preacher was in the midst of his sermon, when a
sudden noise of horses' hoofs drew the attention of
the audience from him. They looked towards the
door, and to their surprise they saw Governor Bull
enter. They rose to receive him, and Mr. Stobo
paused in his discourse. Acknowledging their civility
with a slight wave of the hand, his Excellency
exclaimed, standing at the door of the church, "Gentlemen,
a large body of insurgent negroes is close at
hand. They have fire-arms, and it looks like a serious
matter. Make a stand against them here, while
I ride on to Jacksonburgh for re-enforcements."</p>

<!-- v1 page 313 -->

<p>In another moment he was off; but the scene of
confusion that he left behind him passes description.
The men sprung to their arms, which they were required
by law to carry with them to church, and
issued forth upon the green. The screaming women
and children were left within its walls for protection.
Captain Bee, the principal gentleman of the neighborhood,
assumed the command, and led the small force
out of the village towards Stono. His own house
stood on an eminence about half a mile off, and the
first thing he saw was that it was in the possession
of the insurgents. They had evidently got at his
wine-cellar, and showed unquestionable marks of intoxication.
A negro on horseback was busy among
them, riding from group to group with earnest gestures
of exhortation.</p>

<p>It was none other than Arnold, who found his
forces becoming more and more untractable and insubordinate
at the very time when order and discipline
were needed the most. He in vain endeavored
to prevail upon them to move upon the enemy.
Presently the enemy moved upon them. Captain
Bee led his men rapidly along the road, and, guided
by his knowledge of the country, posted them so as
to command the insurgents on the lawn, while they
were sheltered by the trees that skirted it. Arnold
saw their danger, and ordered the small body of
sober men that obeyed his directions to fire upon the
enemy in their covert. As soon as their fire was
thus drawn, Bee and his men issued from their cover,

<!-- v1 page 314 -->

and, passing by Arnold and his few without notice,
poured a volley with deadly effect into the drunken
and dancing crowd on the lawn. The panic was instantaneous
and complete. They dispersed in every
direction, throwing away their arms as they fled.</p>

<p>Arnold now drew off his command to a thicket
that bounded the lawn on one side, and bade them
sell their lives as dearly as they could. The numbers
were now more equal, and the conflict was long and
desperate. At last, on the road from Wiltown, a re-enforcement
was seen approaching, which the Governor
was leading to the battlefield. Seeing his chance
of maintaining his ground gone, Arnold rushed out
at the head of his surviving friends, to cut their
way through the enemy's ranks, before the succors
arrived; but it was too late. A body of horsemen
galloped upon the ground. The negroes, with Arnold
at their head, fought desperately, but in vain.
He was cut down, and as he fell, a dozen sabres were
uplifted to make his fate certain. But Governor Bull
dashed into the circle, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop, gentlemen! This fellow must not die yet.
He knows things which we must know first."</p>

<p>He was taken from beneath the horses feet, and
carried to the town, where his wounds, which were
not dangerous, were dressed. This done, he was
thrust into a den of torment, called a slave-prison,
belonging to a private person, to spend the night.
And what a night it was!</p>

<p>The next morning he was brought out and examined;

<!-- v1 page 315 -->

but no word of knowledge could they extract
from him. He acknowledged and justified his own
part in this rising; but he utterly refused to implicate
any others, or to give any information as to the
extent of the conspiracy. He was tied up and flogged
(for the first time in his life) until he fainted from
loss of blood; but no syllable of information, or cry
of pain, could be extorted from him. This ordeal
was repeated for three days, with fresh inventions
of torture; but all in vain. His firmness was unshaken.
Then they spoke of pardon and favor as the
reward of frankness. But the only reply they could
obtain was a bitter laugh, which mocked the delusive
offer of the cruelest torture of all. At last, wearied
with their vain attempts, and fearing lest he might
die of exhaustion, they dragged him to a tree in the
public square, and hanged him like a dog.</p>

<p>He died; but his memory, spectre-like, long haunted
the Province. His talents and his endurance, which
his examination and torture had displayed, alarmed
the planters even more than the bloody effects of the
insurrection. At the very next session of the colonial
Legislature (1740), the instruction of slaves was
made a highly penal offence. The alarm was universal.
Every man feared lest he might have an
Arnold on his estate.</p>

<p>And there was reason for their fears. Notwithstanding
the cruel examples which were made of the
captive insurgents, the spirit of Arnold seemed to
walk in the Province. Partial insurrections, the fruit

<!-- v1 page 316 -->

of his labors, were frequent for several years after
his death, and it was not till after the peace with
Spain that the Colony regained its former tranquillity.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"Was I not right," said Mr. Verney, with a mournful
smile, when he had finished the narrative of
which this is an imperfect sketch, "was I not right
in saying that I had had an experience that refuted
your theory of educating slaves for freedom?"</p>

<p>Mr. Langdon could make no reply to such a question
after such a story. He wrung his friend's hand
in silence. He had nothing to say; for philosophy
had not as yet taught men by examples, that the
safe, sufficient, and only possible preparation for freedom
is EMANCIPATION.</p>

<p>The next morning he took leave of Mr. Verney,
and pursued his journey homeward, a sadder if not
a wiser man. He hated slavery more than ever for
this dreadful picture of its works. But, while his
heart bled for the blight which it had shed upon the
life of Verney, he could not disguise from himself,
standing as he did on the brink of a civil war for
liberty, that his deepest sympathies were with Arnold.</p>

<p>When the Revolution broke out, Mr. Verney joined
the army, and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel
in the line. He fought in many of its battles with
the desperation of a man for whom life has no charm,
and death no terrors. But he survived all the great
battles in which he had a part, to fall at length in

<!-- v1 page 317 -->

a partisan expedition on which he had volunteered,
when on a leave of absence, in his native State.</p>

<p>As he died without children or kindred, his estate
escheated to the sovereign people. It has passed
through many hands, and has been racked and "murdered,"
like many another. I am told by one who
lately visited its neighborhood, that it is now a
barren sandhill, its house in ruins, its trees cut
down, its fields a desolation. The pictures which
elicited this story alone remain to recall it. But it
is only for their merit as pictures that they are
valued; the portrait of Colonel Verney being, perhaps,
the only original Kneller (except one of Jeremiah
Dummer, in Boston) in the country. They
are preserved in a public collection in Charleston,
and admired by multitudes, as works of art. But
their history is fading from memory, and it is only
to a few old men whose daily life is in the past, that
they recall the pride, the sorrows, and the ruin of
MOUNT VERNEY.</p>

<p>"IF anything could make a man forgive himself for
being sixty years old," said the Consul, holding
up his wineglass between his eye and the setting
sun,&mdash;for it was summer-time,&mdash;"it would be that
he can remember Malibran in her divine sixteenity at
the Park Theatre, thirty odd years ago. Egad, sir,
one couldn't help making great allowances for <i>Don
Giovanni</i>, after seeing her in <i>Zerlina</i>. She was beyond
imagination <i>piquante</i> and delicious."</p>

<p>The Consul, as my readers may have partly inferred,
was not a Roman Consul, nor yet a French one. He
had had the honor of representing this great republic
at one of the Hanse towns, I forget which, in President
Monroe's time. I don't recollect how long
he held the office; but it was long enough to make
the title stick to him for the rest of his life with the
tenacity of a militia colonelcy or village diaconate.
The country people round about used to call him
"the <i>Counsel</i>" which, I believe, for I am not very
fresh from my schoolbooks, was etymologically

<!-- v1 page 322 -->

correct enough, however orthoepically erroneous.
He had not limited his European life, however, within
the precinct of his Hanseatic consulship, but had
dispersed himself very promiscuously over the Continent,
and had seen many cities, and the manners of
many men and of some women,&mdash;singing-women,
I mean,&mdash;in their public character; for the Consul,
correct of life as of ear, never sought to undeify his
divinities by pursuing them from the heaven of the
stage to the purgatorial intermediacy of the <i>coulisses</i>,
still less to the lower depth of disenchantment into
which too many of them sunk in their private life.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he went on, "I have seen and heard
them all,&mdash;Catalani, Pasta, Pezzaroni, Grisi, and all
the rest of them, even Sonntag, though not in her
very best estate; but I give you my word there is
none that has taken lodgings here," tapping his forehead,
"so permanently as the Signorina Garcia, or
that I can see and hear so distinctly when I am in
the mood of it by myself. <i>Rosina, Desdemona, Cinderella,</i>
and, as I said just now, <i>Zerlina</i>&mdash;she is as
fresh in them all to my mind's eye and ear as if the
Park Theatre had not given way to a cursed shoe-shop,
and I had been hearing her there only last
night. Let's drink her memory," the Consul added,
half in mirth and half in melancholy, a mood to
which he was not unused, and which did not ill
become him.</p>

<p>Now, no intelligent person who knew the excellence
of the Consul's wine could refuse to pay this

<!-- v1 page 323 -->

posthumous honor to the harmonious shade of the
lost Muse. The Consul was an old-fashioned man
in his tastes, to be sure, and held to the old religion
of Madeira, which divided the faith of our fathers
with the Cambridge Platform, and had never given
in to the later heresies which have crept into the
communion of good-fellowship from the south of
France and the Rhine.</p>

<p>"A glass of champagne," he would say, "is all
well enough at the end of dinner, just to take the
grease out of one's throat, and get the palate ready
for the more serious vintages ordained for the solemn
and deliberate drinking by which man justifies his
creation; but Madeira, sir, Madeira is the only standby
that never fails a man, and can always be depended
upon as something sure and steadfast."</p>

<p>I confess to having fallen away myself from the
gracious doctrine and works to which he had held so
fast; but I am no bigot,&mdash;which, for a heretic, is some
thing remarkable,&mdash;and had no scruple about uniting
with him in the service he proposed, without demur
or protestation as to form or substance. Indeed, he
disarmed fanaticism by the curious care he bestowed
on making his works conformable to the faith that
was in him; for partly by inheritance, and partly by
industrious pains, his old house was undermined by a
cellar of wine such as is seldom seen in these days of
modern degeneracy. He is the last gentleman that
I know of, of that old school that used to import
their own wine and lay it down annually themselves,

<!-- v1 page 324 -->

their bins forming a kind of vinous calendar suggestive
of great events. Their degenerate sons are
content to be furnished, as they want it, from the
dubious stores of the vintner, by retail.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was her youth and beauty, sir," I
suggested, "that made her so rememberable to you.
You know she was barely turned seventeen when she
sung in this country."</p>

<p>"Partly that, no doubt," replied the Consul, "but
not altogether, nor chiefly. No, sir, it was her genius
which made her beauty so glorious. She was wonderfully
handsome, though. 'She was a phantom of
delight,' as that Lake fellow says,"&mdash;it was thus profanely
that the Consul designated the poet Wordsworth,
whom he could not abide,&mdash;"and the best
thing he ever said, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"And did you never see her again?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Once only," he answered, "eight or nine years
afterwards, a year or two before she died. It was at
Venice, and in <i>Norma</i>. She was different, and yet not
changed for the worse. There was an indescribable
look of sadness out of her eyes, that touched one oddly,
and fixed itself in the memory. But she was something
apart and by herself, and stamped herself on
one's mind as Rachel did in <i>Camille</i> or <i>Ph&egrave;dre</i>. It was
true genius, and no imitation, that made both of them
what they were. But she actually had the physical
beauty which Rachel only compelled you to think she
had, by the force of her genius and consummate dramatic
skill, while she was on the scene before you."</p>

<!-- v1 page 325 -->

<p>"But do you rank Malibran with Rachel as a dramatic
artist?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," he answered. "But if she had not
the studied perfection of Rachel,&mdash;which was always
the same, and could not be altered without harm,&mdash;she
had at least a capacity of impulsive self-adaptation
about her which made her for the time the character
she personated,&mdash;not always the same, but such
as the woman she represented might have been in
the shifting phases of the passion that possessed
her. And to think that she died at eight and
twenty! What might not ten years more have made
her!"</p>

<p>"It is odd," I observed, "that her fame should be
forever connected with the name she got by her first
unlucky marriage in New York; for it was unlucky
enough, I believe&mdash;was it not?"</p>

<p>"You may say that," responded the Consul, "without
fear of denial or qualification. It was disgraceful
in its beginning and in its ending. It was a
swindle on a large scale; and poor Maria Garcia was
the one who suffered the most by the operation."</p>

<p>"I have always heard," said I, "that old Garcia
was cheated out of the price for which he had sold
his daughter, and that M. Malibran got his wife on
false pretences."</p>

<p>"Not altogether so," returned the Consul. "I
happen to know all about that matter from the best
authority. She was obtained on false pretences, to
be sure; but it was not Garcia that suffered by them.

<!-- v1 page 326 -->

M. Malibran, moreover, never paid the price agreed
upon, and yet Garcia got it, for all that."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "It must have been a
neat operation. I cannot exactly see how the thing
was done; but I have no doubt a tale hangs thereby,
and a good one. Is it tellable?"</p>

<p>"I see no reason why not," said the Consul. "The
sufferer made no secret of it, and I know of no reason
why I should. Mynheer Van Holland told me the
story himself, in Amsterdam, in the year '35."</p>

<p>"And who was he?" I inquired, "and what had
he to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," responded the Consul, filling his
glass, and passing the bottle, "if you will have the
goodness to shut the window behind you, and ring
for candles; for it gets chilly here among the mountains
as soon as the sun is down."</p>

<p>I beg your pardon&mdash;did you make a remark?
Oh, <i>what mountains!</i>&mdash;You must really pardon me;
I cannot give you such a clew as that to the identity
of my dear Consul, just now, for excellent and sufficient
reasons. But, if you have paid your money for
the sight of this Number, you may take your choice
of all the mountain-ranges on the continent, from
the Rocky to the White, and settle him just where
you like. Only you must leave a gap to the west
ward, through which the river&mdash;also anonymous for
the present distress&mdash;breaks its way, and which
gives him half an hour's more sunshine than he
would otherwise be entitled to, and slope the fields

<!-- v1 page 327 -->

down to its margin near a mile off, with their native
timber thinned so skilfully as to have the effect of
the best landscape-gardening. It is a grand and
lovely scene; and when I look at it, I do not wonder
at one of the Consul's apothegms, namely, that the
chief advantage of foreign travel is, that it teaches
you that one place is just as good to live in as
another. I imagine that the one place he had in
his mind at the time was just this one. But that
is neither here nor there. When candles came,
we drew our chairs together, and he told me in
substance the following story. I will tell it in
my own words,&mdash;not that they are so good as his,
but because they come more readily to the nib of my
pen.</p>

</div>

<p>NEW YORK has grown considerably since she was
New Amsterdam, and has almost forgotten her whilom
dependence on her first godmother. Indeed, had it
not been for the historic industry of the erudite
Diedrich Knickerbocker, very few of her sons would
know much about the obligations of their nursing
mother to their old grandame beyond sea, in the
days of the Dutch dynasty. Still, though the old
monopoly has been dead these two hundred years,
or thereabout, there is I know not how many fold
more traffic with her than in the days when it was in
full life and force. Doth not that benefactor of his

<!-- v1 page 328 -->

species, Mr. Udolpho Wolfe, derive thence his immortal
or immortalizing Schiedam Schnapps, the
virtues whereof, according to his advertisements, are
fast transferring dram-drinking from the domain of
pleasure to that of positive duty? Tobacco-pipes,
too, and toys such as the friendly saint, whom Protestant
children have been taught by Dutch tradition
to invoke, delights to drop into the votive stocking,&mdash;they
come from the mother-city, where she sits
upon the waters, quite as much a Sea-Cybele as
Venice herself. And linens, too, fair and fresh and
pure as the maidens that weave them, come forth
from Dutch looms ready to grace our tables, or to
deck our beds. And the mention of these brings me
back to my story, though the immediate connection
between Holland linen and Malibran's marriage may
not at first view be palpable to sight. Still it is a
fact that the web of this part of her variegated destiny
was spun and woven out of threads of flax that
took the substantial shape of fine Hollands; and
this is the way in which it came to pass.</p>

<p>Mynheer Van Holland, of whom the Consul spoke
just now, you must understand to have been one of
the chief merchants of Amsterdam, a city whose
merchants are princes, and have been kings. His
transactions extended to all parts of the Old World,
and did not skip over the New. His ships visited
the harbor of New York as well as of London; and,
as he died two or three years ago a very rich man,
his adventures in general must have been more remunerative

<!-- v1 page 329 -->

than the one I am going to relate. In
the autumn of the year 1825 it seemed good to this
worthy merchant to despatch a vessel, with a cargo
chiefly made up of linens, to the market of New
York. The honest man little dreamed with what
a fate his ship was fraught, wrapped up in those
flaxen folds. He happened to be in London the
winter before, and was present at the <i>d&eacute;but</i> of Maria
Garcia at the King's Theatre. He must have admired
the beauty, grace, and promise of the youthful
<i>Rosina</i>, had he been ten times a Dutchman; and if
he heard of her intended emigration to America, as
he possibly might have done, it most likely excited
no particular emotion in his phlegmatic bosom. He
could not have imagined that the exportation of a
little singing-girl to New York should interfere with
a potential venture of his own in fair linen. The
gods kindly hid the future from his eyes, so that he
might enjoy the comic vexation her lively sallies
caused to <i>Doctor Bartolo</i> in the play, unknowing
that she would be the innocent cause of a more
serious provocation to himself in downright earnest.
He thought of this himself after it had all happened.</p>

<p>Well, the good ship "Steenbok" had prosperous
gales and fair weather across the ocean, and dropped
anchor off the Battery with some days to spare from
the amount due to the voyage. The consignee came
off and took possession of the cargo, and duly transferred
it to his own warehouse. Though the advantages

<!-- v1 page 330 -->

of advertising were not as fully understood in
those days of comparative ignorance as they have
been since, he duly announced the goods which he
had received, and waited for a customer. He did not
have to wait long. It was but a day or two after the
appearance of the advertisement in the newspapers
that he had prime Holland linens on hand, just received
from Amsterdam, when he was waited upon by
a gentleman of good address, and evidently of French
extraction, who inquired of the consignee, whom we
will call Mr. Schulemberg for the nonce, "whether he
had the linens he had advertised yet on hand."</p>

<p>"They are still on hand and on sale," said Mr.
Schulemberg.</p>

<p>"What is the price of the entire consignment?"
inquired the customer.</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dollars," responded Mr. Schulemberg.</p>

<p>"And the terms?"</p>

<p>"Cash on delivery."</p>

<p>"Very good," replied the obliging buyer. "If they
be of the quality you describe in your advertisement,
I will take them on those terms. Send them down
to my warehouse, No. 118 Pearl Street, to-morrow
morning, and I will send you the money."</p>

<p>"And your name?" inquired Mr. Schulemberg.</p>

<p>"Is Malibran," responded the courteous purchaser.</p>

<p>The two merchants bowed politely, the one to the
other, mutually well pleased with the morning's
work, and bade each other good-day.</p>

<!-- v1 page 331 -->

<p>Mr. Schulemberg knew but little, if anything,
about his new customer; but, as the transaction was
to be a cash one, he did not mind that. He calculated
his commissions, gave orders to his head clerk
to see the goods duly delivered the next morning,
and went on Change, and thence to dinner, in the
enjoyment of a complacent mind and a good appetite.
It is to be supposed that M. Malibran did
the same. At any rate, he had the most reason, at
least, according to his probable notions of mercantile
morality and success.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>III.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next day came, and with it came, betimes,
the packages of linens to M. Malibran's warehouse
in Pearl Street; but the price for the same did not
come as punctually to Mr. Schulemberg's counting-room,
according to the contract under which they
were delivered. In point of fact, M. Malibran was
not in at the time; but there was no doubt that he
would attend to the matter without delay, as soon as
he came in. A cash transaction does not necessarily
imply so much the instant presence of coin as the
unequivocal absence of credit. A day or two more
or less is of no material consequence, only there is to
be no delay for sales and returns before payment.
So Mr. Schulemberg gave himself no uneasiness about
the matter when two, three, and even five and six
days had slid away without producing the apparition

<!-- v1 page 332 -->

of the current money of the merchant. A man who
transacted affairs on so large a scale as M. Malibran,
and conducted them on the sound basis of ready
money, might safely be trusted for so short a time.
But when a week had elapsed, and no tidings had been
received either of purchaser or purchase-money, Mr.
Schulemberg thought it time for himself to interfere
in his own proper person. Accordingly, he incontinently
proceeded to the counting-house of M. Malibran
to receive the promised price, or to know the
reason why. If he failed to obtain the one satisfaction,
he at least could not complain of being disappointed
of the other. Matters seemed to be in some
little unbusiness-like confusion, and the clerks in a
high state of gleeful excitement. Addressing himself
to the chief among them, Mr. Schulemberg asked the
pertinent question,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is M. Malibran in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," was the answer, "he is not; and he will
not be, just at present."</p>

<p>"But when will he be in? for I must see him on
some pressing business of importance."</p>

<p>"Not to-day, sir," replied the clerk, smiling expressively.
"He cannot be interrupted to-day on any
business of any kind whatever."</p>

<p>"The deuce he can't!" returned Mr. Schulemberg.
"I'll see about that very soon, I can tell you. He
promised to pay me cash for fifty thousand dollars'
worth of Holland linens a week ago. I have not seen
the color of his money yet, and I mean to wait no

<!-- v1 page 333 -->

longer. Where does he live? for, if he be alive, I
will see him, and hear what he has to say for himself,
and that speedily."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," pleasantly expostulated the clerk,
"I think, when you understand the circumstances of
the case, you will forbear disturbing M. Malibran
this day of all others in his life."</p>

<p>"Why, what the devil ails this day above all
others," said Mr. Schulemberg somewhat testily, "that
he can't see his creditors, and pay his debts on it?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, the fact is," the clerk replied, with an
air of interest and importance, "it is M. Malibran's
wedding-day. He marries this morning the Signorina
Garcia, and I am sure you would not molest
him with business on such an occasion as that."</p>

<p>"But my fifty thousand dollars!" persisted the
consignee. "And why have they not been paid?"</p>

<p>"Oh, give yourself no uneasiness at all about that,
sir," replied the clerk, with the air of one to whom
the handling of such trifles was a daily occurrence.
"M. Malibran will, of course, attend to that matter
the moment he is a little at leisure. In fact, I imagine,
that, in the hurry and bustle inseparable from
an event of this nature, the circumstance has entirely
escaped his mind; but, as soon as he returns
to business again, I will recall it to his recollection,
and you will hear from him without delay."</p>

<p>The clerk was right in his augury as to the effect
his intelligence would have upon the creditor. It
was not a clerical error on his part when he supposed

<!-- v1 page 334 -->

that Mr. Schulemberg would not choose to
enact the part of skeleton at the wedding-breakfast of
the young <i>Prima Donna</i>. There is something about
the great events of life, which cannot happen a great
many times to anybody,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"A wedding or a funeral,<br/>

A mourning or a festival,"</p>

<p>that touches the strings of the one human heart of us
all, and makes it return no uncertain sound. <i>Shylock</i>
himself would hardly have demanded his pound of
flesh on the wedding-day, had it been <i>Antonio</i> that
was to espouse the fair <i>Portia</i>. Even he would have
allowed three days of grace before demanding the
specific performance of his bond. Now, Mr. Schulemberg
was very far from being a Shylock, and he was
also a constant attendant upon the opera, and a
devoted admirer of the lovely Garcia. So he could
not wonder that a man on the eve of marriage with
that divine creature should forget every other consideration
in the immediate contemplation of his
happiness, even if it were the consideration for a
cargo of prime linens, and one to the tune of fifty
thousand dollars. And it is altogether likely that
the mundane reflection occurred to him, and made
him easier in his mind under the delay, that old
Garcia was by no means the kind of man to give
away a daughter who dropped gold and silver from
her sweet lips whenever she opened them in public,
as the princess in the fairy-tale did pearls and diamonds,

<!-- v1 page 335 -->

to any man who could not give him a solid
equivalent in return. So that, in fact, he regarded
the notes of the Signorina Garcia as so much collateral
security for his debt.</p>

<p>So Mr. Schulemberg was content to bide his reasonable
time for the discharge of M. Malibran's
indebtedness to his principal. He had advised Mynheer
Van Holland of the speedy sale of his consignment,
and given him hopes of a quick return of the
proceeds. But, as days wore away, it seemed to him
that the time he was called on to bide was growing
into an unreasonable one. I cannot state with precision
exactly how long he waited. Whether he disturbed
the sweet influences of the honeymoon by his
intrusive presence, or permitted that nectareous satellite
to fill her horns, and wax and wane in peace,
before he sought to bring the bridegroom down to
the things of earth, are questions which I must leave
to the discretion of my readers to settle, each for
himself or herself, according to their own notions of
the proprieties of the case. But at the proper time,
after patience had thrown up in disgust the office of
a virtue, he took his hat and cane one fine morning,
and walked down to No. 118 Pearl Street, for the
double purpose of wishing M. Malibran joy of his
marriage, and of receiving the price&mdash;promised long,
and long withheld&mdash;of the linens which form the
tissue of my story.</p>

<p class="small">"The gods gave ear, and granted half his prayer:<br/>

The rest the winds dispersed in empty air."</p>

<!-- v1 page 336 -->

<p>There was not the slightest difficulty about his
imparting his epithalamic congratulation; but as
to his receiving the numismatic consideration for
which he hoped in return, that was an entirely different
affair. He found matters in the Pearl Street
counting-house again apparently something out of
joint, but with a less smiling and sunny atmosphere
pervading them than he had remarked on his
last visit. He was received by M. Malibran with
courtesy, a little overstrained, perhaps, and not as
flowing and gracious as at their first interview. Preliminaries
over, Mr. Schulemberg, plunging with
epic energy into the midst of things, said, "I have
called, M. Malibran, to receive the fifty thousand
dollars, which, you will remember, you engaged to
pay down for the linens I sold you on such a day.
I can make allowance for the interruption which has
prevented your attending to this business sooner; but
it is now high time that it was settled."</p>

<p>"I consent to it all, monsieur," replied M. Malibran
with a deprecatory gesture. "You have reason,
and I am desolated that it is the impossible that you
ask of me to do."</p>

<p>"How, sir!" demanded the creditor. "What do
you mean by the impossible? You do not mean
to deny that you agreed to pay cash for the
goods?"</p>

<p>"My faith, no, monsieur," shruggingly responded
M. Malibran. "I avow it; you have reason; I promised
to pay the money, as you say it; but, if I have

<!-- v1 page 337 -->

not the money to pay you, how can I pay you the
money? What to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, sir," returned Mr. Schulemberg.
"You have not the money? And you do
not mean to pay me, according to agreement?"</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, how can I, when I have not
money? Have you not heard that I have made&mdash;what
you call it?&mdash;failure, yesterday? I am grieved
of it thrice sensibly; but if it went of my life, I
could not pay you for your fine linens, which were
of a good market at the price."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," replied Mr. Schulemberg, "I had
not heard of your misfortunes; and I am heartily
sorry for them, on my own account and yours, but still
more on account of your charming wife. But there is
no great harm done, after all. Send the linens back
to me, and accounts shall be square between us, and
I will submit to the loss of the interest."</p>

<p>"Ah, but, monsieur, you are too good, and madame
will be recognizant to you forever for your gracious
politeness. But, my God! it is impossible that I
return to you the linen. I have sold it, monsieur&mdash;I
have sold it all!"</p>

<p>"Sold it?" reiterated Mr. Schulemberg, regardless
of the rules of etiquette,&mdash;"sold it? And to whom,
pray? and when?"</p>

<p>"To M. Garcia, my father-in-the-law," answered
the catechumen blandly; "and it is a week that he
has received it."</p>

<p>"Then I must bid you a good-morning, sir," said

<!-- v1 page 338 -->

Mr. Schulemberg, rising hastily, and collecting his
hat and gloves; "for I must lose no time in taking
measures to recover the goods before they have
changed hands again."</p>

<p>"Pardon, monsieur," interrupted the poor but
honest Malibran. "But it is too late! One cannot
regain them. M. Garcia embarked himself for Mexico
yesterday morning, and carried them all with
him."</p>

<p>Imagine the consternation and rage of poor Mr.
Schulemberg at finding that he was sold, though the
goods were not! I decline reporting the conversation
any further, lest its strength of expression and
force of expletive might be too much for the more
queasy of my readers. Suffice it to say that the
<i>swindlee</i>, if I may be allowed the royalty of coining
a word, at once freed his own mind, and imprisoned
the body of M. Malibran; for in those days imprisonment
for debt was a recognized institution, and I
think few of its strongest opponents will deny that
this was a case to which it was no abuse to apply it.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

</div>

<p>I REGRET that I am compelled to leave this exemplary
merchant in captivity; but the exigencies of
my story, the moral of which beckons me away to
the distant coast of Mexico, require it at my hands.
The reader may be consoled, however, by the knowledge
that he obtained his liberation in due time, his

<!-- v1 page 339 -->

Dutch creditor being entirely satisfied that nothing
whatsoever could be squeezed out of him by passing
him between the bars of the debtor's prison, though
that was all the satisfaction he ever did get. How
he accompanied his young wife to Europe, and there
lived by the coining of her voice into drachmas, as
her father had done before him, needs not to be told
here; nor yet how she was divorced from him, and
made another matrimonial venture in partnership
with De B&mdash;&mdash;. I have nothing to do with him or
her, after the bargain and sale of which she was the
object, and the consequences which immediately
resulted from it; and here, accordingly, I take my
leave of them. But my story is not quite done yet:
it must now pursue the fortunes of the enterprising
<i>impresario</i>, Signor Garcia, who had so deftly turned
his daughter into a shipload of fine linens.</p>

<p>This excellent person sailed, as M. Malibran told
Mr. Schulemberg, for Vera Cruz, with an assorted
cargo, consisting of singers, fiddlers, and, as aforesaid,
of Mynheer Van Holland's fine linens. The voyage
was as prosperous as was due to such an argosy. If
a single Amphion could not be drowned by the
utmost malice of gods and men, so long as he kept
his voice in order, what possible mishap could befall
a whole shipload of them? The vessel arrived safely
under the shadow of San Juan de Ulua; and her
precious freight in all its varieties was welcomed
with a tropical enthusiasm. The market was bare
of linen and of song, and it was hard to say which

<!-- v1 page 340 -->

found the readiest sale. Competition raised the
price of both articles to a fabulous height. So the
good Garcia had the benevolent satisfaction of clothing
the naked, and making the ears that heard him
to bless him at the same time. After selling his
linens at a great advance on the cost-price, considering
he had only paid his daughter for them, and
having given a series of the most successful concerts
ever known in those latitudes, Signor Garcia set
forth for the Aztec City. As the relations of <i>meum</i>
and <i>tuum</i> were not upon the most satisfactory footing
just then at Vera Cruz, he thought it most prudent
to carry his well-won treasure with him to the capital.
His progress thither was a triumphal procession.
Not Cort&eacute;s, not General Scott himself, marched more
gloriously along the steep and rugged road that leads
from the seacoast to the table-land than did this
son of song. Every city on his line of march was
the monument of a victory, and from each one he
levied tribute, and bore spoils away. And the vanquished
thanked him for this spoiling of their goods.</p>

<p>Arrived at the splendid city, at that time the largest
and most populous on the North American continent,
he speedily made himself master of it,&mdash;a
welcome conqueror. The Mexicans, with the genuine
love for song of their Southern ancestors, had had
but few opportunities for gratifying it such as that
now offered to them. Garcia was a tenor of great
compass, and a most skilful and accomplished singer.
The artists who accompanied him were of a high

<!-- v1 page 341 -->

order of merit, if not of the very first class. Mexico
had never heard the like, and, though a hard-money
country, was glad to take their notes, and give them
gold in return. They were feasted and flattered in
the intervals of the concerts, and the bright eyes of
se&ntilde;oras and se&ntilde;oritas rained influence upon them on
the off nights, as their fair hands rained flowers upon
the <i>on</i> ones. And they have a very pleasant way,
in those golden realms, of giving ornaments of diamonds
and other precious stones to virtuous singers,
as we give pencil-cases and gold watches to meritorious
railway-conductors and hotel-clerks, as a testimonial
of the sense we entertain of their private
characters and public services. The gorgeous East
herself never showered "on her kings barbaric pearl
and gold" with a richer hand than the city of Mexico
poured out the glittering rain over the portly person
of the happy Garcia. Saturated at length with the
golden flood and its foam of pearl and diamond&mdash;if,
indeed, singer were ever capable of such saturation,
and were not rather permeable forever, like a sieve of
the Dana&iuml;des,&mdash;saturated, or satisfied that it was all
run out, he prepared to take up his line of march
back again to the City of the True Cross. Mexico
mourned over his going, and sent him forth upon his
way with blessings, and prayers for his safe return.</p>

<p>But alas! the blessings and the prayers were alike
vain. The saints were either deaf or busy, or had
gone a journey, and either did not hear or did not
mind the vows that were sent up to them. At any

<!-- v1 page 342 -->

rate, they did not take that care of the worthy Garcia
which their devotees had a right to expect of
them. Turning his back on the halls of the Montezumas,
where he had revelled so sumptuously, he
proceeded on his way towards the Atlantic coast, as
fast as his mules thought fit to carry him and his
beloved treasure. With the proceeds of his linens
and his lungs, he was rich enough to retire from the
vicissitudes of operatic life to some safe retreat in
his native Spain or his adoptive Italy. Filled with
happy imaginings, he fared onward, the bells of his
mules keeping time with the melodious joy of his
heart, until he had descended from the <i>tierra caliente</i>
to the wilder region on the hither side of Jalapa.
As the narrow road turned sharply, at the foot of a
steeper descent than common, into a dreary valley,
made yet more gloomy by the shadow of the hill
behind intercepting the sun, though the afternoon
was not far advanced, the <i>impresario</i> was made unpleasantly
aware of the transitory nature of man's
hopes and the vanity of his joys. When his train
wound into the rough open space, it found itself
surrounded by a troop of men whose looks and gestures
bespoke their function without the intermediation
of an interpreter. But no interpreter was
needed in this case, as Signor Garcia was a Spaniard
by birth, and their expressive pantomime was a
sufficiently eloquent substitute for speech. In plain
English, he had fallen among thieves, with very little
chance of any good Samaritan coming by to help him.</p>

<!-- v1 page 343 -->

<p>Now, Signor Garcia had had dealings with brigands
and banditti all his operatic life. Indeed, he had
often drilled them till they were perfect in their
exercises, and got them up regardless of expense.
Under his direction they had often rushed forward
to the footlights, pouring into the helpless mass
before them repeated volleys of explosive crotchets.
But this was a very different chorus that now saluted
his eyes. It was the real thing, instead of the make-believe,
and in the opinion of Signer Garcia, at least,
very much inferior to it. Instead of the steeple-crowned
hat, jauntily feathered and looped, these
irregulars wore huge <i>sombreros</i>, much the worse for
time and weather, flapped over their faces. For the
velvet jacket with the two-inch tail, which had
nearly broken up the friendship between Mr. Pickwick
and Mr. Tupman, when the latter gentleman
proposed induing himself with one, on the occasion
of Mrs. Leo Hunter's fancy-dress breakfast,&mdash;for
this integument, I say, these minions of the moon
had blankets round their shoulders, thrown back in
preparation for actual service. Instead of those
authentic cross-garterings in which your true bandit
rejoices, like a new Malvolio, to tie up his legs, perhaps
to keep them from running away, these false
knaves wore, some of them, ragged boots up to their
thighs, while others had no crural coverings at all,
and only rough sandals, such as the Indians there
use, between their feet and the ground. They were
picturesque, perhaps, but not attractive to wealthy

<!-- v1 page 344 -->

travellers. But the wealthy travellers were attractive
to them: so they came together, all the same.
Such as they were, however, there they were, fierce,
sad, and sallow, with vicious-looking knives in their
belts, and guns of various parentage in their hands,
while their captain bade our good man stand and
deliver.</p>

<p>There was no room for choice. He had an escort,
to be sure; but it was entirely unequal to the
emergency, even if it were not, as was afterwards
shrewdly suspected, in league with the robbers. The
enemy had the advantage of arms, position, and numbers;
and there was nothing for him to do but to
disgorge his hoarded gains at once, or to have his
breath stopped first, and his estate summarily administered
upon afterwards, by these his casual
heirs, as the King of France, by virtue of his <i>Droit
d'Aubaine</i>, would have confiscated Yorick's six shirts
and pair of black silk breeches, in spite of his eloquent
protest against such injustice, had he chanced
to die in his Most Christian Majesty's dominions.
As Signor Garcia had an estate in his breath, from
which he could draw a larger yearly rent than the
rolls of many a Spanish grandee could boast, he
wisely chose the part of discretion, and surrendered
at the same. His new acquaintances showed themselves
expert practitioners in the breaking-open of
trunks and the rifling of treasure-boxes. All his
beloved doubloons, all his cherished dollars, for the
which no Yankee ever felt a stronger passion, took

<!-- v1 page 345 -->

swift wings, and flew from his coffers to alight in the
hands of the adversary. The sacred recesses of his
pockets, and those of his companions, were sacred no
longer from the sacrilegious hands of the spoilers.
The breastpins were ravished from the shirt-frills,&mdash;for
in those days studs were not,&mdash;and the rings
snatched from the reluctant fingers. All the shining
testimonials of Mexican admiration were transferred
with the celerity of magic into the possession of the
chivalry of the road. Not Faulconbridge himself
could have been more resolved to come on at the
beckoning of gold and silver than were they, and,
good Catholics though they were, it is most likely
that Bell, Book, and Candle would have had as
little restraining influence over them as he professed
to feel.</p>

<p>At last they rested from their labors. To the
victors belonged the spoils, as they discovered with
instinctive sagacity that they should do, though the
apothegm had not yet received the authentic seal
of American statesmanship. Science and skill had
done their utmost, and poor Garcia and his companions
in misery stood in the centre of the ring,
stripped of everything but the clothes on their backs.
The duty of the day being satisfactorily performed,
the victors felt that they had a right to some relaxation
after their toils. And now a change came over
them which might have reminded Signor Garcia of
the banditti of the green-room, with whose habits he
had been so long familiar, and whose operations he

<!-- v1 page 346 -->

had himself directed. Some one of the troop, who,
however "fit for stratagems and spoils," had yet music
in his soul, called aloud for a song. The idea was
hailed with acclamations. Not satisfied with the
capitalized results of his voice to which they had
helped themselves, they were unwilling to let their
prey go, until they had also ravished from him some
specimens of the airy mintage whence they had
issued. Accordingly the Catholic vagabonds seated
themselves on the ground, a fuliginous parterre to
look upon, and called upon Garcia for a song. A
rock which projected itself from the side of the hill
served for a stage as well as the "green plat" in the
wood near Athens did for the company of Manager
Quince, and there was no need of "a tiring-room,"
as poor Garcia had no clothes to change for those he
stood in. Not the Hebrews by the waters of Babylon,
when their captors demanded of them a song of
Zion, had less stomach for the task. But the prime
tenor was now before an audience that would brook
neither denial nor excuse. Nor hoarseness, nor catarrh,
nor sudden illness, certified unto by the friendly
physician, would avail him now. The demand was
irresistible; for, when he hesitated, the persuasive
though stern mouth of a musket hinted to him in
expressive silence that he had better prevent its
speech with song.</p>

<p>So he had to make his first appearance upon that
"unworthy scaffold," before an audience, which, multifold
as his experience had been, was one such as

<!-- v1 page 347 -->

he had never sung to yet. As the shadows of evening
began to fall, rough torches of pine-wood were
lighted, and shed a glare such as Salvator Bosa loved
to kindle, upon a scene such as he delighted to paint.
The rascals had taste; that the tenor himself could
not deny. They knew the choice bits of the operas
which held the stage forty years ago, and they called
for them wisely, and applauded his efforts vociferously.
Nay, more, in the height of their enthusiasm, they
would toss him one of his own doubloons or dollars,
instead of the bouquets usually hurled at well-deserving
singers. They well judged that these
flowers that never fade would be the tribute he
would value most, and so they rewarded his meritorious
strains out of his own stores, as Claude Duval
or Richard Turpin, in the golden days of highway
robbery, would sometimes generously return a guinea
to a traveller he had just lightened of his purse, to
enable him to continue his journey. It was lucky
for the unfortunate Garcia that their approbation
took this solid shape, or he would have been badly
off indeed; for it was all he had to begin the world
with over again. After his appreciating audience
had exhausted their musical repertory, and had as
many encores as they thought good, they broke up
the concert, and betook themselves to their fastnesses
among the mountains, leaving their patient to find
his way to the coast as best he might, with a pocket
as light as his soul was heavy. At Vera Cruz a concert
or two furnished him with the means of embarking

<!-- v1 page 348 -->

himself and his troupe for Europe, and leaving
the New World forever behind him.</p>

<p>And here I must leave him, for my story is done.
The reader hungering for a moral may discern, that,
though Signor Garcia received the price he asked for
his lovely daughter, it advantaged him nothing, and
that he not only lost it all, but it was the occasion
of his losing everything else he had. This is very
well as far as it goes; but then it is equally true
that M. Malibran actually obtained his wife, and
that Mynheer Van Holland paid for her. I dare say
all this can be reconciled with the eternal fitness of
things; but I protest I don't see how it is to be
done. It is "all a muddle" in my mind. I cannot
even affirm that the banditti were ever hanged;
and I am quite sure that the unlucky Dutch merchant,
whose goods were so comically mixed up with
this whole history, never had any poetical or material
justice for his loss of them. But it is as much
the reader's business as mine to settle these casuistries.
I only undertook to tell him who it was that
paid for the <i>Prima Donna</i>&mdash;and I have done it.</p>

<p>"I CONSIDER that a good story," said the Consul,
when he had finished the narration out of which I
have compounded the foregoing, "and, what is not
always the case with a good story, it is a true one."</p>

<p>I cordially concurred with my honored friend in

<!-- v1 page 349 -->

this opinion, and if the reader should unfortunately
differ from me on this point, I beg him to believe
that it is entirely my fault. As the Consul told it
to me, it was an excellent good story.</p>

<p>"Poor Mynheer Van Holland," he added, laughing,
"never got over that adventure. Not that the
loss was material to him,&mdash;he was too rich for that,&mdash;but
the provocation of his fifty thousand dollars
going to a parcel of Mexican <i>ladrones</i>, after buying an
opera-singer for a Frenchman on its way, was enough
to rouse even Dutch human nature to the swearing-point.
He could not abide either Frenchmen or
opera-singers all the rest of his life. And, by Jove!
I don't wonder at it."</p>

<p>Nor I, neither, for the matter of that.</p>

VICTORINE, A MS. DRAMA;</p>

<p>IT is now something more than fifty years ago that
I was an undergraduate at Harvard College. My
home was in a remote part of New England, which
in those days before railroads were imagined, and
before even stage-coaches were introduced, was practically
as far distant as the most remote of the last
batch of new States is at the present day. My intercourse
with my family was necessarily confined to
two or three short visits during the course of my
college life,&mdash;one of which I accomplished on foot,&mdash;and
to a straggling letter, which now and then came
lagging along in the saddle-bags of the mail-carrier,
and which by a wonderful coincidence, scarcely less

<!-- v2 page 4 -->

remarkable than the consentaneous decease of Adams
and Jefferson, sometimes fell into the hands of its
lawful proprietor. Whatever may be the sins of the
gentleman who now presides as tutelary genius over
the mail-bags of the nation at Washington, I believe
that no one who remembers the way in which the
epistolary intercourse of the country was managed
half a century ago, would care to exchange the system
of which he is the head for the good old plan
which encumbered the days of the Confederation. I
truly believe that the ingenuous youth who are relegated
by their anxious sires to the universities of
the petty princes of Germany to learn how to act the
part of Republican citizens, and who often return,
spectacles for men and angels, wiser than their masters,
with beard and hair streaming more meteor-like
than theirs, and transcending even the transcendentalism
of the newest school of philosophy, in short,
as Tacitus says, <i>Germanis ipsis Germanior</i>,&mdash;I say I
truly believe that these rising hopes of our country
are more liable to be regularly and easily interrupted
in their more important pursuits by the arrival of
long-drawn-out epistles, full of the exploded doctrines
of the New England school of philosophy and religion,
though three thousand miles removed, than I
was at a distance of little more than a hundred and
fifty.</p>

<p>Be these things as they may, whenever one of these
loitering missives did arrive, it was sure to contain,
among much excellent advice and sound instruction,

<!-- v2 page 5 -->

an injunction to take the earliest opportunity of visiting
old Colonel Wyborne, a distant relative of the
family, and one to whom my father was under serious
obligations for good services done him before
the Revolutionary war compelled him to retire from
Boston. Like a foolish boy as I was, I postponed
complying with this repeated injunction from year to
year. I felt a natural awkwardness about going near
twenty miles to see an old gentleman, of whom I knew
nothing with certainty, except that he lived in the
most complete seclusion, and whose reputation for eccentricity,
much exaggerated by common report, made
me rather nervous about my reception. I much preferred
spending my holidays in the congenial society
of my dear old aunt Champion, and begrudged the
monstrous piece that a visit twenty miles off would
cut out of the longest of my available vacations.
But at last my continued negligence drew down upon
me a severer rebuke than I had yet received, when I
was on my summer's visit during my junior year, and
I was laid under the parental command (in those days
the highest earthly authority) to devote the ensuing
Thanksgiving holidays to a visit to this venerated
relative. Upon my return to college I made it my
earliest business to write an apologetic letter, excusing
my long delays, and asking his permission to pay
my respects to him during the Thanksgiving week.
In due course of time I received a cordial affirmative,
couched in the most courteous and condescending
language, disclaiming any right on his part to expect

<!-- v2 page 6 -->

such a sacrifice of time and pleasure on mine, but at
the same time giving me full credit for my readiness
to make it, and expressing the warmest pleasure at
the idea of seeing once more in his solitude the son
of his old and valued friends. The elegance and
urbanity of his letter, as well as its spirit and fire,
prepossessed me strongly in favor of the venerable
writer; and though I could not but be conscious that
I did not deserve all the commendations that he
bestowed upon me, yet I resolved that my conduct
should be such in future, that he should have no reason
to think them misplaced. My curiosity was now
awakened with regard to his character and history,
and I lost no time in endeavoring to learn what I
could respecting them from the kind oracle to whom
I have before alluded.</p>

<p>On the very next Saturday I found myself sitting
opposite my excellent aunt Champion, separated
from her, as she sat in her high-backed arm-chair,
only by the small mahogany table from which the
cloth was just withdrawn by the faithful Dinah, revealing
its polished surface and carved edges; and
which reflected in its rosy depths the images of the
aspiring decanter, rising with a graceful swell from
its firm base to its tapering neck, filled with the rich
vintage of the most fortunate of "the islands of the
blest;" and decorated, as were the wineglasses,&mdash;perfect
cones, resting securely on their apices upon the
tall stems,&mdash;with a galaxy of stars, and festoons of
ribbons with fluttering bows. The beams of the

<!-- v2 page 7 -->

afternoon's sun, struggling through the leaves of the
garden trees, shone aslant, with a pleasant autumnal
glow, upon the carpet just behind her chair. My
good aunt, when she filled her glass, and half in jest
and half in earnest, gave her invariable toast, "THE
KING" (a political heresy which the sterling excellence
of her wine went far to palliate), looked like
some dame of a former age, who had burst her cerements,
and returned to upper air to reveal some ancestral
secret to her youthful descendant. Having
duly drained my glass in honor of his Britannic
Majesty (for my excellent relative, orthodox in all
points, abhorred heel-taps), and incontinently replenished
it, I held up the brimming beaker to the light,
and admiring the rich hue of the liquid ruby,&mdash;glowing
with a richness and depth of tint which might
have put to shame any cathedral-window in the
world,&mdash;I sighed, and, betwixt game and earnest, said,
"Ah, my dear aunt, we must make the most of this
good wine, for it is now hard to find. The confounded
Revolution has demolished half the cellars
in the country."</p>

<p>"It is so indeed!" the good lady responded. "It
was but last week that I dined with Governor Hancock,
and I assure you the wine was scarcely drinkable.
Indeed, his Excellency apologized for it by
saying that his cellar had gone to the Devil during
the war, and that he was but just getting it to rights
again. As for his wine having gone to the Devil, I
could easily account for that, for the biggest part of

<!-- v2 page 8 -->

it had gone down the gullets of the Sons of Liberty.
But that he should have been so besotted with party
madness as to have neglected to keep up the well-earned
fame of his cellar, is amazing&mdash;he who was
acknowledged to have the best in the Province! I
could almost pardon his treason sooner than this
abominable folly," she said, and consoled herself
with an emphatic pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," replied I, "a sad defect in his
character. It was not so in the good old times of
the royal governors."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my dear boy! no, indeed! that it was
not," rejoined my good aunt. "Why, the cellars of
the old Province House were a perfect history of the
Colony: they were the very archives of good-fellowship.
The old gray-headed negro butler who was
transmitted from one governor to another for many
years, had a history for every pipe and bin; and
many a good story could he tell of the merry times
of Burnet and Pownal. Ah! they were sad fellows,
and had a set of roystering blades about them. All
this, you understand, however, was under the rose;
and their revels were so managed as to give as little
offence as possible to their righteous subjects. It
was pretty well understood, however, that, like old
Noll, they were more given to seeking the corkscrew
than the Lord."</p>

<p>"Our gentlemen, too," said I, "have lost much of
the spirit which honorably distinguished their fathers,
who would have submitted to a reproach on the fair

<!-- v2 page 9 -->

fame of their ancestors as on that of their cellars.
These confounded politics have distracted their attention
from matters of real importance."</p>

<p>"True enough, true enough!" rejoined Mrs. Champion.
"And there you have another blessed consequence
of this glorious Revolution! What can you
expect of men who make a boast of despising their
claim to an honorable descent? They deserve to
drink bad wine for the rest of their days. Cellar
pride cannot long outlive family pride." She ceased
and sighed.</p>

<p>A short pause ensued, which I profitably filled up
by sipping the genial juice with the reverence which
the thought that it was the last of a generous stock
was fitted to inspire. My dear aunt sat silent, tapping
her snuff-box with her fruit-knife, and evidently
absorbed in sad meditation on the degeneracy of the
times, and on the change which had stolen over the
little world in which she lived, and tinged with a
more sombre hue the evening of her days.</p>

<p>Willing to divert her mind from this melancholy
abstraction, I reverted to the subject immediately
before us, and, throwing an air of sympathy and
interest into my manner, I inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, my dear aunt, what may be the history of
this good wine?"</p>

<p>"This wine," she replied, starting from her revery,
"this wine is the Quebec wine, so called from
the circumstance of its having arrived in harbor on
the same day on which the news of Wolfe's victory

<!-- v2 page 10 -->

was received. My husband immediately christened
it with the name of that glorious battle, and always,
as long as he lived, nursed the infant liquor with
peculiar care. One pipe of it, I remember, he forthwith,
on the very day, despatched to John Wyborne
at Sanfield."</p>

<p>"What!" interrupted I, "old Colonel Wyborne?
He is the very person I wanted to ask you about;
and this is certainly a pleasant introduction to my
inquiries. Pray, aunt, what manner of man was he?
For I am going to spend the next Thanksgiving
holidays with him."</p>

<p>"John Wyborne! He is a nobleman of God's
own creation, a man of ten thousand. I have known
him from his boyhood, and have never known a
man on whose mind and body Nature had more
plainly stamped GENTLEMAN. However, I have not
seen him for these twenty years; for, since I laid
down my carriage on your uncle's death, I have
never been to see him, and it is more than twice
that number of years since he was in Boston; so
that it is not unlikely that time may have made
some inroads on his outer man. But I will answer
for the freshness of his mind and his heart."</p>

<p>"I think you may safely do that, my dear aunt,"
I replied, "for I have proof of it under his own hand
and seal;" saying which, I produced his letter to me,
and by my aunt's request read it to her, she having
mislaid her spectacles. Her eyes glistened as I proceeded;
for the characteristic animation and point

<!-- v2 page 11 -->

and high-breeding of the letter, evidently awoke recollections
and feelings which had long slept, and
carried her back to the days when they were both
young and hopeful and happy. When I had done,
and restored the epistle to my pocketbook, after a
moment's musing she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! that is like him: that is like John Wyborne.
What a man was lost to the world when he
forsook it! That was the only mistake he ever
made&mdash;except, indeed, his taking the wrong side in
the late Rebellion."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said I, "that he is the least in the
world of a humorist, though no one seems to know
much about him. Do you know what induced him
to give up the world and retire to Sanfield in the
prime of his life?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she replied. "I know all about his
history. But as to his being a humorist in the usual
acceptation of the word, I do not believe a word of it.
I have sometimes thought that a distinction should
be made in that order of nature between the bad
humorists (by far the larger division) and the good
humorists. The first are a set of selfish, peevish
wretches, the torment of their wives and servants,
and the annoyance of their neighbors; who think
that the reputation of oddity which they have cultivated
will cover and excuse the multitude of their
vexatious though petty iniquities. The second class
is composed of men of the finest natures and gentlest
dispositions, whom some unlucky crook in their

<!-- v2 page 12 -->

lot has put a little out of conceit with the world
and its ways, and who, withdrawing from the beaten
paths of life, pursue by themselves what seems to
them the chief good of existence, indifferent to the
wonder and contempt of those who are in hot chase
of the more generally recognized objects of human
pursuit, and in whose heart it is not easy to conceive
of any other motives of human action. This sort of
men, however, are most fastidiously careful never to
permit their oddities to chill the kindliness of their
hearts, and to interfere with the comforts of others:
they ride their hobbies with so careful a rein, that
they never run against or unhorse any of their neighbors
whom they meet prancing on theirs on the
King's Highway. A humorist in this sense it cannot
be denied John Wyborne is."</p>

<p>"But what was the disturbing cause," I inquired,
"which made him shoot from his sphere? Was he
crossed in love, or ambition, or business? Or what
might it have been?"</p>

<p>"Why, he can hardly be properly said to have
been crossed in either," replied my aunt; "and yet
it was certainly disappointment that drove him into
seclusion. But it is a long story&mdash;too long to be
told now: we will reserve it for some of our winter
evenings."</p>

<p>"But pray, my dear aunt," I remonstrated, "give
me a skeleton of his history and character, if you
have not time to dissect them scientifically" (I was
at this time dipping into medical and anatomical

<!-- v2 page 13 -->

books), "for I may not see you again before I pay
my visit; and I should be sorry to venture into such
a curious country without some sort of a map for my
direction."</p>

<p>"Well, well," good-naturedly rejoined my aunt,
"you were always a spoiled child, and, never having
been refused anything you thought proper to ask for,
I suppose that is a good reason for your not being
denied anything now. So fill your glass and mine,
and we will drink the good Colonel's health." Which
having been duly performed, my aunt proceeded:
"John Wyborne's father was a merchant in the
golden days of the town (commercially speaking, I
mean), when it had a free trade to all parts of the
world, and no man asked of any New England ship
whence it came or whither it went. In that world,
before colonial policy or custom-house officers, old
Mr. Wyborne flourished, and made a princely fortune,
for those days, or, indeed, subsequent times; for he
left at his death no less a sum than fifty thousand
pounds sterling. When the Colonies had grown into
importance enough to attract the attention of the
ministry at home, and restrictions were laid upon
the trade of the Province, Mr. Wyborne withdrew
from business; and obtaining admission into the
General Court, and afterwards into the Council, spent
the remainder of his days agreeably enough in annoying
the Governor, and doing his best to thwart all
his favorite measures, and cut down his salary. In
the intervals, however, of these useful and pleasant

<!-- v2 page 14 -->

avocations, he found time hang rather heavily on his
hands, and bethought himself of taking a wife to help
him bear the burden. In those days, as now, it
generally happened, by some chance or other, that
a man with fifty thousand pounds in his pocket was
not long to seek for a wife. Mr. Wyborne was no
exception to the rule, and before many months he
was the husband of Miss Armytage, a daughter of
one of the oldest families in New England&mdash;or in
Old England either, for that matter. I have heard
my mother tell of the splendid style in which they
lived in their fine house in King Street: there was
no family in the Province who approached them in
their manner of living. They had no children till
the birth of Colonel Wyborne, in the year 1701.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyborne died in the full prime of his life, in
the year 1711, when his son was but ten years old;
but his widow survived him for many years. Colonel
Wyborne was reared in the usual style of that
day; was flogged by Master Cheever at the Latin
School into a competent knowledge of Latin; and,
after the usual transmigrations from the fagging
freshman to the dictatorial senior, he took his degree
in the year 1720. He remained at Cambridge for
three years,&mdash;till he proceeded Master of Arts,
which was then a usual thing for those who could
afford the expense. Having thus finished his academical
course, he resolved to visit Europe,&mdash;an
undertaking of no common occurrence in those days,
when it was thought little less than a tempting of

<!-- v2 page 15 -->

Providence for a man to cross the ocean, unless it
were to bespeak a cargo of English goods, or to look
out for a grateful recipient of salt fish and lumber;
which, of course, altered the moral bearings of the
transaction altogether. Mrs. Wyborne most strenuously
opposed her son's plan, and urged against it
all the arguments which she could draw from the
perils of the sea and the temptations of the shore,&mdash;a
species of logic which I have remarked to make
but little impression upon the understandings of
young gentlemen who have been infected with a
propensity to do as they liked, and had the power
in their own hands of doing it. Dr. Cotton Mather,
too, employed a whole afternoon and evening in
attempting to defeat a project which would remove
from his congregation one of its wealthiest members
for an indefinite period, at the very time of life when
his own influence might be most certainly fastened
upon him, and who might not, improbably, return
with a yearning after the more liberal atmosphere
of the Manifesto Church. Maternal entreaties and
ecclesiastical warnings were, however, in vain, and to
London he went by the next ship that sailed for
home. Not long after his departure, his mother
consoled herself for his loss by marrying the Rev.
Mr. Selleck, minister of the town of Sanfield, where
Colonel Wyborne now lives. For a year or two after
his departure, his young contemporaries and friends
received frequent letters from him, giving full and
glowing accounts of his success, beyond his hopes, in

<!-- v2 page 16 -->

accomplishing the great objects of travel. A variety
of circumstances, which I cannot now recapitulate,
aided by his ample means, prepossessing appearance
and address, and also by the novelty of his character
as an accomplished transatlantic, introduced him
into the brilliant circles of wit and fashion which
distinguished the reigns of George I. and George II.
He was well received by 'the wicked wasp of
Twickenham,' was domesticated at Lydiard a few
years later, and when in Dublin was admitted to a
share in the somewhat unclerical frolics of the Dean
of St. Patrick's. His success, however, was not confined
to that disappointed though brilliant coterie;
for he was admitted to the dressing-room of Lady
Mary Wortley, had bowed at Sir Robert's levee, and
was well received at court. His good fortune accompanied
him to France, where he had an opportunity
of witnessing, and, I fear, of partaking, the profligate
revels of the Regent Duke of Orleans, and was well
acquainted with Voltaire in his prime. The blandishments
of Paris, however, did not detain him long
from Italy, where he lingered for two years, seduced
by its delicious climate and immortal ruins. At the
end of two years he returned to England; but before
this time his correspondence with his Boston friends
had flagged, as correspondences are apt to do, and
soon after breathed its last. His intercourse with
his mother was kept up till her death; but, from
the distance at which she lived, we in town gleaned
but scanty accounts of his adventures. In fact, from

<!-- v2 page 17 -->

about the year 1726 or 1727, we almost entirely lost
sight of him; and, as years rolled away, his image
grew less and less distinct in the mind's eye of his
best lovers; and it was pretty well understood that
he had lived so long in the sunshine of courts and the
fellowship of wits, that he was unfitted to return to
the austere and somewhat pedantic society of New
England. The gentlemen who now and then went
home on business could only learn that he lived in
the north of England, for the most part, and but
seldom visited London. Fifteen years from the time
of his departure passed away, and all expectation of
ever seeing him again was abandoned, when one day
the ship 'Speedwell' was said to be below, from London.
This was much more of an event in those days
than now, and the talk of the town for some time
before and after it occurred. My husband immediately
took a boat, and visited the ship in the roads,
and soon returned with the strange news that John
Wyborne was on board; and that was not all,&mdash;that
he had brought his wife with him. Here was a
surprise. His wife! Why, we had never heard
that he was married, or even thought of such a
thing! Who was she? How did she look? Was
he much changed? My husband, however, broke off
my exclamations and inquiries by the intelligence
that the returned prodigal and his English spouse
were to be our guests until they could take possession
of their own house. This information threw
me into a little of a nutter, for I was but a young

<!-- v2 page 18 -->

housekeeper then; and though pleased with the idea
of seeing my old playfellow again, and gratified at
his choosing my house as his temporary home from
amongst the many hospitable roofs of friends and
relatives proffered to his acceptance, still, I could
not but feel a little anxious, lest the difference should
be too marked between the appliances of luxury to
which he had been accustomed at home, and the
more humble though substantial comforts which I
could provide. And then his wife&mdash;an Englishwoman,
too! However, there was luckily not much
time for self-tormenting, for it was now one o'clock,
and our guests were expected before dark. You may
imagine how poor old Dinah, then a strapping wench,
and Celia, who died before your memory, bustled
about, not unassisted by me, to put the blue chamber
overhead in due order, and to get all things in readiness
for the due welcome of the coming guests.
When all things were ready, or in train, and I had
duly arranged my dress, I descended to the opposite
parlor to await their arrival. Having now nothing
more to do, I began making myself work by displacing
and then rearranging all the furniture in the
room, and now and then giving an uncalled-for poke
to the blazing fire, which C&aelig;sar had just lighted on
the hearth; for it was one of those delightful clear,
cool days in autumn, when a good fire of an evening
is relished as a luxury, and not regarded as a mere
necessary of life, as in winter. At last, about six
o'clock, they drove up, accompanied by your uncle,

<!-- v2 page 19 -->

in the chariot, and, as soon as they appeared, I felt
that all my previous twitter had been unnecessary:
the first glance I had of them told me that.</p>

<p>"The fifteen years which had elapsed since I
last saw John Wyborne had transformed the slight
though graceful youth into an elegant man of mature
age; but the hurried warmth with which he approached
and saluted me, and the evident emotion
which he felt at the sight of the familiar faces and
scenes of his youth, assured me that he had passed
through the ordeal of a European life without injury
to the better feelings of his nature. He was now
thirty-seven or thirty-eight years of age, but did not
look a day more than thirty. He was more than six
feet tall, and of a noble presence. His face beamed
with manly intelligence; and his dark eye, which
was at that moment quenched with emotion, at calm
times sparkled with animation, or glowed with enthusiasm.
His mouth was rather large than otherwise,
but susceptible of the most varied expression, and
his teeth were of the most glittering whiteness.
But," continued my aunt after a short pause, shaking
her head with a pensive air, "it is hardly worth
while to describe so particularly what the ruins you
are going to see once were; but all who ever knew
John Wyborne in his best estate will tell you that
they have never forgotten the fascination of his
smile and eye."</p>

<p>"I assure you, my dear aunt," I answered, my
curiosity being now fully awakened, "that you cannot

<!-- v2 page 20 -->

be too minute for me; but, as time presses, pray
give me some account of his wife. Was she as fine a
creature as his wife should have been?"</p>

<p>"Indeed she was," replied my aunt: "at least, as
far as one could judge from appearance and manner,
she was well worthy of her husband. But there was
some mystery about her which we never could fathom,
and, where there is mystery, there must always be a
degree of doubt as to the worthiness of the person,
especially of the woman, to whom it attaches. But,
poor thing, she did not live long to be the theme of
the gossiping small-talk of the herd of society, or
of the anxious and legitimate curiosity of her near
relatives."</p>

<p>"Did she indeed die so early?" exclaimed I. "But
pray go on with your story, for I am impatient to
hear the end of it."</p>

<p>"That you will soon hear," my aunt resumed;
"for there is but little more to tell. John Wyborne
and his wife remained our guests for about six weeks,
while the old family mansion in King Street was getting
in readiness for them. This time was filled up
by a succession of gayeties in honor of their arrival.
Governor Belcher entertained them at a grand dinner
at the Province House, at which were assembled the
most distinguished of the gentlemen and ladies of the
town. All the principal inhabitants vied with each
other in welcoming the new-comers with splendid
hospitalities. The fine autumnal days which were
free from engagements in town we employed in

<!-- v2 page 21 -->

scouring the country round, sometimes in the chariot,
and sometimes on horseback, to display the
charming scenery of New England, glowing with the
tints of a New England autumn. On these excursions
we always stopped at some of the gentlemen's
seats, which were sprinkled over the country in every
direction, and the gates of which always stood wide
open to invite the passing friend. Alas! too many
of those hospitable portals have been closed by the
cruel Revolution, or passed into niggard hands.</p>

<p>"Well, the six weeks soon passed away, and our
guests left us, and took possession of their own house.
And a fine establishment it was, being the result of
taste combined with wealth; and yet there was no
attempt to outshine their neighbors: everything was
in the very best style of the town, and nothing more.
When they were fairly fixed in their new abode,
they gathered around them a circle of the choicest
society; and that winter was a memorable one in
the annals of anyone who was admitted within that
charmed circle. Mr. Wyborne gave a weekly dinner
on Wednesdays, which he managed to make a very
different affair from the somewhat stiff festivities of
set dinners at that time, or any other time either, for
that matter.</p>

<p>"It was observable, however, after the first excitement
of a new country and the first bustle of
hospitalities were over, and they were quietly settled
down by their own fireside, that Mrs. Wyborne was
but ill at ease. Her form by degrees lost something

<!-- v2 page 22 -->

of its symmetrical roundness, her brilliant complexion
was exchanged for an alabaster chilliness, and
her eyes gradually lost much of their peculiar beauty.
Her husband seemed but to live for her, and there was
no circumstance of watchful love and sedulous attention
in which he was wanting. She, however, drooped
from month to month so palpably as to excite the
anxiety of her best friends and the lively curiosity
of her common acquaintance.</p>

<p>"One thing was remarkable enough, and that was
that neither she nor her husband ever made the
faintest allusion to her parentage or history previous
to their marriage. Mr. Wyborne so promptly and
dexterously parried all attempts to extract any information
on these points from him, and his wife
met them with such a mournful embarrassment, that
it was soon understood that they were forbidden
topics in their presence; though you may well imagine
that they were discussed in all their bearings,
known and imagined, when they were absent. The
circumstance, too, that she was plunged in double
gloom upon the arrival of every fresh packet of letters
from Europe, did not tend to damp the curiosity, or
to extinguish the conjectures, of those kind inquirers
who are more solicitous about the affairs of others
than about their own."</p>

<p>"That certainly did look rather suspicious," interrupted
I. "Did it not excite some doubts in the
minds of the lovers of scandal as to whether they
were married at all?"</p>

<!-- v2 page 23 -->

<p>"That scandalous construction," Mrs. Champion
replied, "would no doubt have been put upon their
unaccountable behavior, if Mr. Wyborne had not,
probably with a foreboding of such a rumor, taken
good care to exhibit as an interesting autograph his
marriage-certificate, signed by the famous Dr. Young,
who performed the ceremony in London by special
license. Matters went on thus for some months,
their house being the centre of our limited sphere,
and almost always thronged with company, which
John Wyborne anxiously gathered round him in hopes
of dissipating the growing melancholy of his wife.</p>

<p>"The winter wore on pleasantly enough to all
except the fated mistress of the mansion. John Wyborne
had received his library, the finest private one
in the country, which he had collected abroad, and
had arranged it entirely to his mind. Many valuable
pictures, a few statues (rather shocking to the primitive
taste of those days), and what was to us a rich
collection of articles of <i>virtu</i> arrived, and added to
the attractions of his house. A superficial observer
would have pronounced John Wyborne a happy man.
He had health, riches, taste, a well-cultivated mind,
a splendid library, warm friends of congenial tastes,
and a charming wife. What could man desire more?
Surely he had clutched the rare boon of unmixed felicity.
Alas, my dear boy! he was no exception to
the general doom which condemns man to trouble.
All the appliances of luxury, all the qualifications of
taste, even all the leisure and ample means for gratifying

<!-- v2 page 24 -->

a passion for elegant letters, bring no balm to the
wounds of a gentle nature, inflicted by the sight of a
beloved object consuming away before the sight of
a mental malady beyond the leech's arts. Religion
only, my son, religion only, has consolations adequate
to support the soul under such a burden." She
paused, for the memories of her own sorrows were
painfully rising to her brain, and a phantom train of
unburied griefs stretched in long perspective before
her mind's eye. She, however, never long yielded to
the painful influences of the past, and soon resumed
the thread of her narration.</p>

<p>"Matters went on thus till the middle of February,
when Mr. and Mrs. Wyborne, having their establishment
now complete, issued cards of invitation to all
their acquaintance to an entertainment given in
return for the multitudinous attentions which had
welcomed them on their arrival.</p>

<p>"It was bitterly cold, a glittering, clear winter's
night, which well set off the genial and brilliant scene
within. Your uncle and I dined there, and helped
them to oversee the last preparations. By six o'clock
all the company were assembled, comprising all the
town which had any claim to admittance, from old
Dr. Coleman down to the freshest and prettiest young
girls just escaped from the nursery.</p>

<p>"The recollection of that scene is indelibly impressed
upon my memory by the sudden change
which soon was brought over it; though there is not
half a dozen of the gay crowd which filled the rooms

<!-- v2 page 25 -->

that night that now survive. What a strange thing
is memory!&mdash;that I at eighty-three should at this
moment be, as it were, in the midst of a brilliant and
happy crowd of half a century ago, almost every one
of which is now in the grave, except a few withered,
weak old men and women just tottering on its brink.
I could describe to you, if I had time, and you cared
to hear it, every dress in the room, from the splendid
brocade and diamonds of the mistress of the house,
whose chief ornament, however, was her beautiful
hair, falling in natural ringlets over her neck (for
powder was not then in fashion), and from Governor
Belcher's black velvet coat and breeches, richly
embroidered waistcoat, point-lace ruffles, diamond
buckles, and dress sword, down to the beautiful Mary
Osborne, now old Mrs. Estridge, in her white watered
silk, and glistening high-heeled shoes, which Cinderella
might have envied, seated on the window-seat,
half hid by the heavy damask curtain, listening to
Ralph Estridge (whom she not long afterwards married),
who had just returned from home, the image
of a London petitmaitre, in a peach-bloom silk coat
lined with white, pink satin waistcoat embroidered
with gold, white satin breeches and white silk stockings,
and a rapier with a steel handle, glittering like
diamonds. Books, flowers, paintings, beautiful women,
and elegant men, made it a picture to be recalled with
pleasure, if it were not for the dark cloud which soon
gathered over it.</p>

<p>"Well, everything went on well enough. All were

<!-- v2 page 26 -->

animated, and most were happy. The mistress of the
house looked like herself again; the young people
made love; their elders talked of the prospect of
a war with Spain; some of the more austere of the
elder school of New England manners privily shook
their heads at the frightful havoc which luxury was
making in the good old simplicity of the fathers.
The most rigid of the reverend divines and honorable
judges, however, smoothed their stern features on
this occasion, and looked on with complacent smiles.
At about half-past eight supper was announced, and
we ascended to the supper-room, led by the Governor
and the mistress of the house. It was a beautiful
spectacle. The tables lavishly adorned with flowers,
the luxurious banquet served almost entirely on plate,
the lovely and graceful figures which were grouped
around the board in the full flow of youthful spirits,
and the venerable forms and beneficent countenances
of the elder guests contrasting with them, made up
a scene of enchantment which I have never seen
approached since. The master of the feast seemed to
be doubly inspired by the spirit of the scene, and
never shone more brilliantly, both in his own proper
powers of entertainment and his tact in drawing
out the resources of others. My good old friend
Dr. Byles, then a young and brisk divine, was in his
element, and often set the table in a roar with his
lively sallies; and many a sharp encounter of wits
took place between him and his host. Suppers, however,
like all other terrestrial things, must come to an

<!-- v2 page 27 -->

end; and after about an hour and a half had been
delightfully spent over the table, we returned to the
parlor. Soon afterwards his Excellency, the clergy,
and the more dignified portion of the company, took
their leave, which was the signal for the appearance
of the violins and the commencement of what was
then a most unusual event&mdash;a ball. Mrs. Wyborne
opened the ball with a minuet with Mr. Hutchinson
(our late governor); and, that prologue being happily
over, the country-dances began in good earnest, and
were kept up with untiring devotion till nearly four
o'clock, when the assembly gradually melted away.
My husband and I, as we had been the first on the
ground, were the last to leave it. As we walked
through the deserted rooms with our charming hostess,
and observed with pleasure how the excitement
and success of the evening had recalled her vanished
bloom, and rekindled her faded eyes, we little thought
that the next occasion which would summon us to
those apartments would be her funeral."</p>

<p>"Her funeral!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Even so," she mournfully rejoined, "and so soon.
She was taken violently ill the very next day,&mdash;probably
from undue excitement, and unusual fatigue acting
upon a frame already debilitated,&mdash;and in less than
a week she was dead." She paused, and, as I looked
at her, I saw that her aged eyes were wet at thought
of the sad images which her story had recalled.</p>

<p>"And how did her husband bear the dreadful blow?"
I inquired.</p>

<!-- v2 page 28 -->

<p>"His despair was frightful for the first few days,"
she replied. "He refused admission to his best friends,
and would not be comforted. He shut himself up
for hours with the beloved remains, and the anxious
and affectionate servants listened with dismay to the
tempest of grief which they could hear raging within.
Such violence of sorrow, however, could not last long;
but, when the first fierce paroxysms were over, the
preternatural calmness which succeeded was scarcely
less shocking than they. I can never forget, should I
live a century longer, the dreadful change which that
short week had wrought in his face: death had not
thrown a more gloomy change over the features of
the beloved dead,&mdash;his cheeks as hollow as a ghost's,
his eyes of a stony vacancy, his pale lips quivering,
and his whole energies apparently bent upon a mighty
effort at calmness.</p>

<p>"That funeral was worth a thousand homilies.
There she lay at length in her coffin, who, but a little
week before, was the charm of all who saw or heard
her; in the very room, too, in which she had led the
dance, and surrounded by most of the very revellers
who had basked in her radiant presence. It was
a chastening though grievous vicissitude, from the
house of feasting to the house of mourning, and from
the garments of joy to the weeds of heaviness. The
contrast of those darkened rooms, filled with mournful
countenances and suits of woe, to the glittering
lights, splendid dresses, flashing eyes, and merry hearts
of the time of their last meeting there, must have inscribed

<!-- v2 page 29 -->

an ineffaceable lesson on the most thoughtless
hearts. Nothing broke the sepulchral stillness but an
occasional sob, which would find its way from some
woman's heart, or a half-suppressed sigh from some
manly bosom, till at length Dr. Sewall rose, and
raised all our souls upon his eloquent prayers to
heaven. When this impressive service was over, the
last sad procession was marshalled to the tomb.</p>

<p>"It was one of those dark, gloomy winter's days,
when the sky looks like a vault of stone almost resting
upon the roofs of the houses. The ground was
covered with snow, and a few flakes now and then
fell heavily down through the still cold air. The pall
was held by the lieutenant-governor and five other
of the principal gentlemen of the time. Then followed
the bereaved husband, supported by my husband
and Dr. Sewall. Then came the governor and
magistrates, succeeded by along train of relatives and
friends in the deepest mourning. Behind followed
the family coach, the carriage, as well as the servants,
in mourning, then the governor's coach, and next the
carriages of almost all the gentry of the town and
country round. As the black train swept through
the streets, the common people, who thronged them
to witness the spectacle, all uncovered as we passed,
and showed none of the levity which I have some
times seen to accompany great funerals.</p>

<p>"At last, after making a large circuit, in consequence
of the numerous attendance, we arrived at the
King's Chapel churchyard, and all passed round by the

<!-- v2 page 30 -->

family tomb of the Wybornes, and took a last look at
its latest and fairest tenant before its ponderous jaws
closed upon her forever. Poor John Wyborne could
bear up under his heavy grief no longer, but was supported
by his anxious friends, almost insensible, to his
coach. The rest of the melancholy attendants stood
reverently by as the mourner was borne along, and
then dispersed, and, entering the coaches which were
in waiting, were slowly rolled to their various homes.</p>

<p>"The gloom of this event hung over the town for
all the remainder of the season and for months afterwards.
It seemed as if every family was mourning
over some household death. The difference which it
made to me, you may easily imagine. It was almost
the first severe loss of the kind that I had ever encountered:
Heaven knows it was not the last!" After
a short pause, she resumed, "John Wyborne continued
throughout the spring in a most pitiable state:
the violence of his first grief was succeeded by an
apathetic listlessness from which nothing could
arouse him. He formed a plan for returning again to
Europe, which was encouraged by his friends as the
medicine most likely to be effectual; but he did not
seem to retain enough of the energy with which he
used to overflow to make the necessary preparations.
At last, when May was well advanced, my husband
proposed to him to visit Sanfield, the town in the Old
Colony where his mother had spent the last years of
her life after her marriage with the Rev. Mr. Selleck
and where a considerable estate was going to decay

<!-- v2 page 31 -->

for want of the eye of the master. As this excursion
did not involve much expenditure of resolution or
trouble, Mr. Wyborne consented to accompany Mr.
Champion to the scene of his mother's later years.
It was a most exquisite spring day when they went
down, when the country was clad in its softest and
freshest green, and the fields were white with apple-blossoms,
and the delicious air seemed as if it might
have been a balm even for a broken heart.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyborne seemed to feel the benefit of the
change of place almost immediately; and the appearance
of his house and grounds, and of the village in
its vicinity, seemed to strike his fancy. The house,
which I will not describe, as you will soon see it, was
somewhat the worse for want of inhabitants for a
number of years, since the decease of his reverend
step-father; but the avenue of fine elms and grove,
which sheltered it from the sea, had grown up prosperously,
though untrimmed and neglected. The
garden was something like that of the sluggard, to be
sure; and the sun-dial in its centre was almost hid by
nettles and weeds, and the wall was in many places
broken down, and the fish-pond was almost choked up
with rubbish. I should have told you that the new
part of the house was built, the trees planted, and the
grounds laid out, by an English Church clergyman
of fortune, who emigrated to this country about the
beginning of the century, and who, finding small
encouragement in his clerical capacity, had employed
himself in the business and pleasures of a country

<!-- v2 page 32 -->

life, and of whose heirs Mrs. Wyborne had purchased
it on her second marriage.</p>

<p>"There was enough of native luxuriant beauty
about the place to captivate the good taste of its
owner; while there was an air of neglect and desolation
about it which seemed to suit the present melancholy
mood of his mind. My husband was well
pleased to hear him avow his intention of putting the
place to rights, and making it his residence for a part
of the year. He encouraged him in his plan, and
recommended that no time should be lost in putting
it into execution. Accordingly they hunted up a
farmhouse in the neighborhood, whose owners were
willing to take him and his servant in until the old
house could be made habitable. Rejoiced to have
been the means of providing a healthful occupation
for his friend's sick mind, my husband returned to
town, expecting that he would follow in about a fortnight.
A fortnight elapsed, and a month, and a year,
and yet he tarried.</p>

<p>"He left his house in town for a couple of days,
perhaps a week; and now almost half a century has
passed away since then, and he has never once recrossed
its threshold, or revisited his native town.
He had found the first comfort which his wounded
spirit had known among the old trees and green
meadows of his new home and by the side of the
ocean which washed his estate less than half a mile
from the house; and he felt for them the love of a
mourner for the tried friends of his affliction. Nothing,

<!-- v2 page 33 -->

however, was further from his intention than making
that sequestered place his permanent abode. But
the first summer and autumn were insensibly wasted
away in the pleasant tasks of bringing order out of the
chaos of his grounds, and of restoring to the old mansion
the comfort and elegance of which time and neglect
had stripped it. Then, just as winter set in, his
house was ready for his occupation, and he could not
bear to leave this new home, which was invested only
with happy associations, for that roof which was overshadowed
by the gloom of his mighty sorrow, and
under which he would be haunted at every turn by the
ghosts of his buried joys. So the winter passed away
and when spring returned he had made up his mind
to make this his chief residence, and sent for his
library. When winter again arrived, his attachment
to the place had strengthened, and he determined to
spend it as he did the last. In this way his habits
of life became gradually fixed; his love for his new
home, and his disinclination to return to his old one,
increased with every year; and so his prime of manhood
and his green old age have worn away in that
retirement."</p>

<p>"Had he any society in his solitude?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"But little in his immediate neighborhood," my
aunt replied, "except the clergyman and one or two
country gentlemen. But for many years, during the
summers and autumns, he had no lack of company
from Boston: his house was scarcely ever empty, at
those times, of his old friends and companions. Your

<!-- v2 page 34 -->

uncle and I always paid him at least one visit a year,
as I told you before, until I gave up the coach upon
his death. By degrees, however, as his old friends
died off, his younger ones grew less frequent in their
visits. And then the Revolution came in to confound
all old friendships; so that for a good many years he
has been thrown almost entirely on his own resources.
I am told, however, by some old friends who are still
constant to him, that he has acquired no cynicism
from neglect, and gathered no rust from solitude, but
is still, in his manners, dress, and way of living, a fine
relic of the thoroughbred gentleman of the middle of
this century."</p>

<p>The good old lady here ceased. I warmly thanked
her for her story, and assured her that it had increased
my curiosity to make the personal acquaintance of
its hero a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are going to see him," she resumed;
"for you may never chance to meet with exactly such
another specimen of the old school again: at least I
do not know where his fellow is to be found."</p>

<p>At this point we were interrupted by the entrance
of Dinah with the tea-things, which brought us down
from our high converse about other days to a sense of
present realities. After my good aunt had dispensed
the fragrant infusion in china's earth, the sun began
to remind me, by the peculiar mellowness of his light
among the leaves of the trees, that it was time for me
to set forth on my return to my rooms. My horse
being accordingly brought round by C&aelig;sar, I affectionately

<!-- v2 page 35 -->

saluted my dear old friend, and, receiving
from her a needless injunction not to fail to make my
visit to Sanfield, I mounted my nag, and rode briskly
back to my home among classic shades.</p>

<!-- v2 page 36 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>MY aunt's history had made so strong an impression
upon my fancy, that I became as impatient
for the time of my visit to arrive as I had
formerly been ingenious to invent excuses for putting
it off. My strong curiosity to see the subject of
her narration, actually sometimes inspired a kind of
nervous apprehension that something would happen
to prevent my visit, that I might be summoned in
some other direction, or that the good old gentleman
might in the interval exchange his quiet home for
the vault of his ancestors. No such impediment,
however, occurred. The autumn months melted
gradually away, and at last brought round the annual
festival of the Pilgrim Fathers. I obtained
permission to leave Cambridge a day sooner than the
regular holidays began in order that I might have a
good three-days' visit, which I thought little enough
for my purpose; the reverend president giving a
ready assent to my application when he understood
its object, for Colonel Wyborne was his old and
valued friend. He intrusted to me a packet containing
some sermons of his which had been recently
printed, as well as a verbal message of friendly compliments;
and having instructed me to call upon

<!-- v2 page 37 -->

him on my return, with an account of his excellent
friend, "he shook his ambrosial curls (of his wig),
and gave the nod," which was the signal for my
departure.</p>

<p>I louted low, and withdrew, inly pleased at the successful
issue of an interview which was then considered
as the most appalling of human ordeals.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning of the last week in November,
I bestrode the very indifferent beast which enjoyed
the somewhat unenviable distinction of being
the best livery horse in Cambridge, and set forth,
like Yorick, with (not quite) a half-dozen shirts and
a black pair of silk breeches in my portmanteau,
on my long-looked-for excursion. Contrary to established
usage in such cases, the day was fine and the
roads excellent. It was one of those delicious, mild,
soft days which sometimes occur at the very close of
autumn, and seem to breathe a second spring in the
very presence of winter himself; and to desire</p>

<p class="small">"Upon old Hyem's chin and icy beard<br/>

To hang a chaplet of young summer buds."</p>

<p>As I rode over Brighton bridge upon a steed which
had not yet got over the stimulus of his double allowance
of oats, with my back turned upon my nursing
mother, whose cares are but too often felt to be only
vexatious till it is too late to profit by them, and a
week before me unhaunted by the apparitions of
dead authors and living tutors, I respired the bland
air with a joyous feeling of young life, and felt as if

<!-- v2 page 38 -->

there were no such thing as pain or trouble in the
world. I trotted along the pleasant winding roads
through Roxbury, Brookline, and Dorchester, with a
heart ready and willing to receive pleasure from
every object which struck the senses. The trees
were almost bare, and the earth was sear and brown;
yet the yellow light of the rejoicing sun seemed
almost as beautiful as the leafy glories of their summer's
estate. The farmhouses, with their roofs sloping
to the ground; the sheds laden with the golden
pumpkins, prophetic of pies to come; the corn-barns
with the yellow ears peeping out from between the
interstices of the sides; the wood-pile, suggestive
of images of comfort and merry winter nights; the
picturesque well-pole, not yet supplanted by the
prosaic pump of these utilitarian days,&mdash;all were
fruitful of happy thoughts and pleasant day-dreams.
As I ascended Milton Hill, I saw for the first time
the magnificent prospect it displays, and checked my
horse on its summit to admire the wide sweep of
country, the tufted hills, the winding river, and the
glorious burst of ocean, with here and there a white
sail gliding along its blue surface, which it commands.
On the other side of the road I saw the
charming villa of Governor Hutchinson, with the fine
plantations he had made, and the trees under which
he had hoped his latter days would have declined
in peace; and I felt that his exile from this beloved
and lovely spot was punishment enough for his political
offences as a public man. It is said, and I can

<!-- v2 page 39 -->

well believe it to be true, that he died of Milton Hill.
It must have been a bitter thing to have revisited its
beloved shades, and gazed on its gorgeous view in
the visions of the night, and then to have awoke a
neglected, impoverished, despised exile, forever separated
from the spot of earth which was dearer to him
than all the world beside.</p>

<p>As I wound farther into the country, I often met,
jogging cheerfully along, hale ruddy countrymen;
some young, some gray-haired, presiding over wagons
groaning under the weight of the victims which had
been sacrificed against the coming festival. Hecatombs
of beeves, ghostlike forms of turkeys, partridges
never again to rise on whirring wing, ducks fated to
swim no more save in their own gravy, passed in
long procession, like the shadowy train of Banquo's
descendants. As I passed through the villages in
my way, they had all a sort of pleasant holiday look.
The labors of the year seemed to be over, and the
inhabitants to be assisting one another to do nothing
in the most neighborly manner possible. The boys,
let loose from school, were playing football with all
the energy which that manly game demands, but
stopping in their sport to look at the passing stranger,
and salute him, according to the good old custom,
with uncouth demonstrations of respect.</p>

<p>At noon, I bated from my journey, though bent on
speed, and drew the rein at the door of what was to
me a most promising hostelry, being a farmhouse of
the oldest description which New England affords,

<!-- v2 page 40 -->

with its jutting second story as a "coigne of vantage"
against the Indians, its diamond panes of glass set in
lead, and its window-frames opening inwards like
folding-doors; and which was proclaimed to be a
place of entertainment for man and beast by a most
truculent portrait of General Washington, which
hung in chains from a superb old elm before the
door. I soon learnt that the hospitable proprietor
was no less a person than Captain Crake, who had
seen hard service both in the old French war and in
the recent struggle for independence. The gallant
captain did me the honor to invite himself to dine
with me, and I found him an entertaining specimen
of a large class of our revolutionary officers, who had
superinduced the military frankness and ease of one
conversant with camps upon the sturdy independent
yeoman of the Old Colony. While I patiently exercised
my molars and incisors in an almost hopeless
attempt to subdue a beefsteak, which seemed as if it
might have been ravished from the yet living flank
of the sire of Abyssinian herds, I quite won the heart
of my worthy landlord by the interest which I took
in his descriptions of his campaigns and of the well-fought
fields which he had seen. He exhibited with
much satisfaction the honorable scar in his arm
which he had received at the storming of Stony
Point, and the sword which the Marquis de Lafayette
had presented to him, and his insignia of the Cincinnati.
He also displayed a richly chased gold
watch, which had been given to him by a French

<!-- v2 page 41 -->

nobleman whom he had made the captive of his bow
and of his spear in Canada, I think at the taking of
Fort Niagara, as a token of his sense of the humanity
and courteous treatment which he had received at
the hands of his captor. During his long term of
service he had associated on terms of equality with
gentlemen of much higher rank in society than he
had been accustomed to know, except at a humble
distance; and he felt the loss of the company of his
old companions-in-arms most severely after the army
was disbanded. He had, as a resource against ennui,
rather than any expectation of gain, hoisted the head
of his beloved chief before his paternal door to invite
the passing guest; and the neighboring gentry always
made it a point to stop at the captain's door as they
passed, and gratify the veteran by treating him as
one who had bravely fought his way to an equality
with themselves at a time when the distinctions of
rank were still strongly marked. I subsequently
cultivated the acquaintance of the erect old man, and
extracted from him many a curious fragment of public
and private history. But my horse is again at
the door, and I must return the military salute of
mine host with what grace I may, and hasten onward,
for I have no time to lose.</p>

<p>My horse, who, during the course of his long and
active life, had done little else than tread and retread
the weary round of what were in those days entitled
the great and the little squares, which were certain
roads encompassing Boston at a greater and less distance,

<!-- v2 page 42 -->

began to show unequivocal symptoms of weariness
and disgust at my eccentric orbit. No logic,
either of whip or spur, could convince him of the
propriety of advancing at a more rapid rate than a
sort of shamble between a walk and a pace. To
crown all, he managed to cast a shoe at the most
inconvenient place possible, so that I had to lead
him for a matter of four miles before I could find
a blacksmith. All these untoward circumstances
combined to make my approach to the end of my
journey as gradual as might well be. Accordingly,
when the sun set, as sober suns will do, at a little
after five o'clock, he left me about five miles from
Sanfield. Now this distance I could have soon annihilated
if I had been unincumbered with my impracticable
companion; but, as it was, I was obliged to
do as wiser men have been obliged in like cases to
do before me,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"And will again, pretend they ne'er so wise,"</p>

</div>

<p>even to succumb to the wayward humor of my ill-conditioned
helpmate, and to console myself with
cursing the evil hour in which I formed the ill-starred
union.</p>

<p>The day, which had been cloudless as a midsummer's
noon, began, before the sun went down, to be
overcast with black clouds, portentous of showers.
A piercing north-east wind reigned in the stead of
the vernal breeze of the morning, and whirled the
brown leaves in rustling eddies like a miniature

<!-- v2 page 43 -->

tornado. As I stumbled onwards upon my journey,
the twilight faded away, and was followed by a
moonless night. I could scarcely distinguish my
road, which seemed to grow longer and longer, under
my feet. In something more than two hours, however,
I was cheered by the ruddy blaze of a blacksmith's
forge, which gave me assurance of being near
a village. Upon reaching the smithy, I inquired of
the son of St. Dominic as to my whereabouts, and
was informed that I was on the confines of the village
of Sanfield, and had ingeniously managed to take
a wrong turning a few miles back, which had brought
me more than a mile beyond my destination by a
wrong route. Nothing remained for me now but to
take the instructions of the worthy smith, and turn
my horse's reluctant head in the opposite direction,
and, having been put in the right way, to pursue it
till I should come to the high trees, which were the
mark of my journey's end.</p>

<p>My nag, contrary to my expectation, seemed to
snuff afar off the comfortable provender which
awaited him, and laid his feet to the ground with a
speed he had not put forth since the morning. As
I advanced, I earnestly bent my eyes into the thick
darkness on my right hand, in hopes of distinguishing
the friendly branches which were to point me
to the termination of my weary way. I looked
with the more earnestness as a few drops of a cold
November rain began to fall, and to threaten no
inconsiderable addition to the discomfort of my

<!-- v2 page 44 -->

benighted estate. At last, however, as I descended a
considerable hill, I heard the sough of the blast stirring
the boughs of many lofty trees on my right
hand, and could perceive lights glimmering through
the darkness at a considerable distance. These I at
once knew must be the indications of the hospitable
habitation I sought. The pitchy blackness of the
night compelled me to dismount, and grope my way
to the fence, and along it, in search of the approach to
the house. This I felt to be prudent as I heard the
hoarse murmur of what seemed to be a considerable
stream near me. I groped in vain, however, for the
carriage-road; and could find but a small gate, intended
only for human ingress, about opposite where
the little candle threw its beams into the night, like
"a good deed in a naughty world."</p>

<p>In this distress I had nothing left for it but to tie
my horse to the fence, and follow the adventure on
foot. Entering the gate, I proceeded onwards, with
the withered leaves crackling under my feet, and the
wind sighing among the bare branches over my head.
The rain now began to patter in more frequent drops
upon the dead leaves over which I walked, with the
peculiar clattering noise which is delightful to listen
to before a comfortable fire, but less musical to the
ear of an amateur of Nature's harmonies, when he is
behind the scenes and in the midst of the performers.
As I neared my hoped-for haven of rest, I was
saluted by the fierce barking of a dog, who, if his
size were answerable to his voice, might be a match

<!-- v2 page 45 -->

for the shaggy "Dog of Darkness" himself. Now,
however sweet it may be</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"To hear the watch-dog's honest bark<br/>

Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near <i>home</i>,"</p>

</div>

<p>I put it to anyone who has tried the experiment,
whether it be an equally delightful sound as we
approach a strange house of a dark night. I venture
to say that the stoutest hearted despiser of dogs and
devils would feel some misgivings under such circumstances,
lest his fate might be at least as hard as
that of the noble bard just quoted, who was welcomed
on his return to Newstead by having</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"His Argus bite him by the breeches."</p>

</div>

<p>It would not do, however, to be daunted by this new
lion in my path, which I afterward found was
chained, like the one in Pilgrim's Progress: so on
I fared, like any errant knight, resolved at all hazards
to achieve my adventure. The house seemed
to recede as I advanced, and I thought that I had
measured a good mile before I reached it: it was, in
fact, about a quarter of a mile. As, however, there
is an end to the disagreeables as well as to the agreeables
of life, I at last stood in the porch, wet, hungry,
and tired, and made the brazen knocker give clamorous
notice of my presence. The door was soon
opened by an elderly woman of respectable appearance,
of whom I inquired if this was Colonel Wyborne's
house, and whether he were at home; to both
which interrogatories I received the expected affirmative,

<!-- v2 page 46 -->

together with an invitation to walk in. The
good woman, eying me attentively, then said, in the
negative-affirmative form in which inquiries are generally
put in New England,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure you are not the Mr. Dalzell whom the
Colonel expects from college, are you?"</p>

<p>I assured her of my confident belief in my identity
with the individual in question; upon which she
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, the Colonel will be right glad to see you,
sir, though he did not expect you till to-morrow, or
he would have sent the chariot to meet you at
Captain Crake's. But how did you get here, sir?
You surely haven't walked all the way?"</p>

<p>I gave the information desired; upon which she
promised to send the coachman for my horse, and requested
me to walk into the parlor, where the Colonel
was sitting. She accordingly threw open the door on
the right as I entered the hall, and ushered me into
an apartment, the lightsome cheerfulness of which
was enhanced by the chilly, wet, famished condition
in which I entered it. The master of the house,
however, was not there; though the chair drawn to
the fire, the small mahogany table, covered with a
green cloth, and sustaining a massive silver candlestick
and wax candle, and the second volume of
Sir William Temple's works in folio, showed that he
had not been long absent. The housekeeper then
left the room by the door by which we had entered,
for the purpose of finding him, and announcing my

<!-- v2 page 47 -->

arrival. The first object which attracted my attention
was the noble fire which roared up the chimney,
to which I incontinently rushed, and bathed my
shivering frame in the genial warmth. When I had
imbibed as much caloric as my forward man required,
I turned what Lord Castlereagh used to call
"a back-front" to the generous blaze, and took a
survey of the apartment. The walls were panelled
in oak, with a gilt moulding, now a little tarnished.
Between the two windows opposite was a large mirror,
framed in mahogany, with gilt sconces for lights.
Under it was a table covered with a rich Turkey
rug, which was well piled with books and papers,
and beneath which appeared a couple of small globes.
The closed window-shutters were well-nigh concealed,
as well as the high window-seats of oak, by the
depending folds of the crimson damask curtains.
Between the two windows on my right hand was a
card-table of mahogany, black with time, clasping
heavy balls in its clawed feet. On the side of the
room opposite to the card-table was a most luxurious
easy-chair&mdash;a fit cradle for declining age&mdash;and a
footstool, both covered with chintz protecting the
crimson damask, which on occasions of importance
was revealed, to match the curtains. In the nook on
the side of the fireplace answering to the door by
which I entered was a secretary, its looking-glass
doors opening over what seemed to be a chest of
drawers, but which, when drawn out, formed a writing-desk
with pigeon-holes innumerable. Above the

<!-- v2 page 48 -->

looking-glass doors were three smaller drawers;
the inner one with fluted rays diverging from the
middle of its lowest side to its edges; the whole
crowned by a sort of pyramidal pediment, the polished
wood reflecting the surrounding objects like
marble, and the brass handles glistering like gold.
A thick Turkey carpet covered the floor, and a sufficient
number of inviting chairs, with carved frames
and well-stuffed seats, expanded their arms to welcome
the weary guest. It may be readily conceived
that I took in this inventory in less than a tithe of
the time it has taken to recount it, and had again
turned to the blazing hearth. The chimney was
one of those which men built when the forests grew
up to their very doors, and it was their ambition to
consume them as rapidly as possible. The fireplace
was encircled with my favorite Dutch tiles, and surmounted
by a capacious mantel-piece, which, as well
as the panels over it, were covered with particular
care.</p>

<p>While I was thus engaged in surveying these
images of comfort, and basking in the blessed warmth,
I heard a slight noise behind me, and, turning suddenly
round, I saw before me my venerable host,
who had just entered by a door which I have not
mentioned, opening from the side on the left of the
fireplace as I stood with my back to it. The apparition
was one which might have startled one who
might be taken by surprise. His face was furrowed
with wrinkles, his teeth gone, his eyebrows bushy,

<!-- v2 page 49 -->

but of a snowy whiteness, under which his eyes
looked out with a keenness and brilliancy which
seemed almost preternatural. His head was covered
with a crimson velvet cap with a silk tassel in the
centre, under which he wore a linen cap, turned up
in front and at the sides over the velvet one, of the
purest white. He had on a branched-damask dressing
gown, pearl-colored silk breeches, a large flapped
waistcoat of the same, embroidered with silk, white
silk stockings, and black velvet slippers; his neck
encircled by a white stock clasped behind with a
large paste buckle. In his hand he bore the fellow
of the silver candlestick upon the stand before mentioned;
and under his other arm he carried the mate
to the volume of Temple's works which I have said
lay open upon it.</p>

<p>It was plain that my arrival had not been announced
to him, as, indeed, it hardly could have
been in the minute or two which had elapsed since
my entrance; and he stood for a moment gazing at
me from beneath his shaggy eyebrows with an earnestness
which had the expression of sternness and
almost of austerity. I immediately advanced, and,
relieving him of his folio and candlestick, introduced
myself as his dilatory cousin, who had at last redeemed
the promise which his parents had made for
him, of a visit to their much-honored relative. By
the time I had delivered myself to this effect, and
had deposited his honorable load upon the stand, he
had fully recovered himself, and, with a countenance

<!-- v2 page 50 -->

beaming with affectionate pleasure and hospitable
joy, he took both my hands, and warmly pressing
them, he bade me a most cordial welcome to his
house, adding,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am the more glad to see you, my dear boy, because
your being better than your word in coming a
day sooner than you promised shows that you were
really in earnest to give an old man pleasure, and not
merely induced by your dear parents' request. However,
I am afraid that your ride hither has been a
more fatiguing one than I had hoped to have made
it, for I should have sent John and the carriage to
meet you at Crake's. But however, here you are, and
you cannot come too soon, or stay too long." Saying
which, he again shook me by the hand, and wheeling
his arm-chair, with my assistance, to the fireside, he
motioned me to take a chair by his side, and we sat
down and talked</p>

<p class="small">"Affectionate and true,<br/>

A pair of friends, though I was young,"</p>

<p>and though my revered friend had the advantage of
the Matthew of the poet by a dozen years. The
punctilious politeness of the old school, informed with
the soul of real kindliness of heart and the evident
gratification which my visit to his solitude gave him,
made me feel as much at my ease with him as if a
draught from the Fountain of Youth had washed away
threescore and ten of his years. We talked first and
foremost of my parents, of whose well-being I gave

<!-- v2 page 51 -->

him what information I possessed, and in every
particular of whose way of life in their new home he
displayed the warmest interest. He then inquired
after the welfare of his old friend, my aunt Champion,
and received with marks of hearty satisfaction
my accounts of her abounding in all that should
accompany old age, as well as the affectionate salutations
of which I was the bearer. He then talked
about the college, in which he felt all that warm
interest which has in all times done honor to her
sons, with but few melancholy exceptions. I duly
presented the greetings of the president, and announced
the advent of the sermons which graced my
portmanteau. Having suitably acknowledged these
favors, my venerable friend suddenly looked up in
my face, and said,</p>

<p>"By the way, I am very selfish to be catechising
you in this way without remembering that you must
be almost starved. How long is it since you dined?"</p>

<p>I replied that I dined at Captain Crake's at about
one o'clock. "Bless me!" he replied: "that is seven
hours ago and better. Do me the favor to pull the
bell, and this matter shall be put to rights. Are you
not ravenously hungry?"</p>

<p>I should have done injustice to the sentiments of
my heart if I had replied in the negative, and accordingly
assented to his proposition in its fullest extent,
and, having pulled the bell as he desired, heard with
unmitigated satisfaction his directions to Mrs. Waldron,
his housekeeper, to have supper anticipated, and

<!-- v2 page 52 -->

furnished forth with all despatch. Many minutes did
not elapse before that excellent person made her
appearance, and with the assistance of a gray-headed
negro brought in a small dining-table from the hall,
which was soon covered with a tablecloth of the
finest damask, and spread with a pair of nicely roasted
cold chickens, and a ham worthy of Westphalia itself,
a loaf of the purest of wheat bread, and some smoking
roasted potatoes, flanked with a decanter of old
Madeira, and a flagon of home-brewed beer. After
due justice had been done to these viands, they were
replaced by a pumpkin-pie of wonderful dimensions
and admirable composition, escorted by a cranberry-tart,
the white flaky paste of which was beautifully
contrasted with the celestial rosy red of the fruit, and
by a noble Stilton cheese. My hospitable entertainer
surveyed my feats, as I rapidly made the good
things before me invisible with the appetite of a
hungry boy, with an air of complacent good-humor,
and as I approached the end of my labors, suggested
the medicinal virtues of a bowl of hot punch to my
consideration. I could not dissent from a proposition
emanating from such a source, and the motion was
carried by general consent. Peter, the gray-headed
negro just mentioned, was accordingly despatched for
the materials, and soon returned with the lemons,
sugar, shrub, and old Jamaica, and a small kettle of
hot water; which being deposited, he retired again,
and brought back with him the punch-bowl, of the most
precious porcelain of the Celestial Empire, and a fit

<!-- v2 page 53 -->

receptacle for the nectarous compound it was to receive.
Peter, under the special eye of his master, concocted
the mixture, and, having launched the last lemon-paring
upon its bosom, consigned the precious burden
to his master's hands. He, having touched it to
his lips, passed the bowl to one who took a more
liberal draught. Peter having removed the remains
of the supper, and moved the table nearer the hearth,
Colonel Wyborne and I drew our chairs closer to the
fire and to each other, with the genial bowl between
us (for the heresy of ladies had not crept in within
the pale of good-fellowship), and we wore away the
evening hours in most delightful talk.</p>

<p>The conversational powers of my host were unimpaired
by years, and had just enough of a smack of
what was then called the old school to give a racy
flavor to his abundant small-talk. His remarks were
rich and varied to a degree which I have never heard
surpassed, though I have listened in my time to most
of the famous conversationists of the age. His experience
of life, which, though it had been completed a
half a century before, was of the most extensive description,
seemed to be as fresh in his recollection as
if he had left the bustling scene but yesterday. The
images of his early years and his European sojourn
were as distinct and sharp in their outlines as if they
were but just impressed; for the events of his retirement
were not numerous or striking enough to have
effaced or impaired them. His society, both on this
occasion and all following ones, had a charm from

<!-- v2 page 54 -->

this very circumstance, which that of no other man&mdash;even
one who had enjoyed the same early opportunities,
but had continued to mingle with the base
crowd&mdash;could possess. He seemed to transport you
by the magic of his words to an age that was past,
and to a circle which had become historical, and
many members of which had taken their niches in
the temple</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Where the dead are honored by the nations."</p>

</div>

<p>The insignificant particulars which he now and
then incidentally dropped of the habits and way of
life of the illustrious acquaintances of his youth, gave
a vitality to the cold ideas I had formed of them from
books and their works, and almost seemed to evoke
them from the shades to our presence. He delighted,
too, as most old men do, to go back to his schoolboy
and college days, and describe the boyish troubles and
frolics of those hours when that flame burnt high and
strong, which was now flickering in its socket.</p>

<p>Thus, in various converse, the hours flew imperceptibly
away. Blazing logs had been reduced to a
glowing mass of coals; the candles had nearly measured
out their little span of life; and the great clock
in the hall had tolled the knell of another day. The
good housekeeper, who had several times made for
herself errands into the room to see what was going
on, at last entered, unbidden, with the chamber candlesticks,
and, wishing us a good-night, withdrew.
The Colonel then made a move to retire, declaring

<!-- v2 page 55 -->

that he had not so egregiously violated the regularity
of his life for many a year. He first desired me to
ascertain whether the bowl was empty, and having
been assured by me, in return, that "the tankard was
no more," invited me to light the candles, and be
shown to my sleeping-apartment. He accordingly,
assuming one of the tapers, marshalled me the way
that I should go, through the hall, up a pair of stairs
properly so called, ascending in two flights with a
spacious landing between, and as unlike as well as
may be the corkscrew abominations which put in
jeopardy the lives and limbs of the present generation.
My chamber was in the front of the house,
over the winter parlor in which I had spent the evening.
My host, giving a general survey to the apartment,
to see that all was in due order, shook me
affectionately by the hand, and, enjoining it upon
me to lie as long as I chose in the morning, bade me
a good-night, and left me.</p>

<p>The appearance of my dormitory was quite in
keeping with the specimen of the house I had seen,
as far as I could judge by the light of my candle,
assisted by the expiring rays of a few brands, which
were all that were left of a cordial fire which had been
lighted on my arrival. The bed was of ample capacity,
swelling up with a downy buoyancy, and covered
with a gorgeous quilt, evidently the handiwork of fair
hands of other days; the pillows were ruffled, and
the sheets of a most inviting whiteness. Over the
bedstead the tester was suspended from the ceiling,

<!-- v2 page 56 -->

from which flowed on all sides thick curtains of green
damask. An India cabinet occupied the space between
the windows opposite the bed, yet redolent of
the perfumes which it imbibed in Far Cathay, and
displayed on its pictured surface the rich costumes
and quaint customs of her inhabitants. Between the
windows opposite the fireplace was a massive chest
of drawers, upon which stood an old-fashioned oval
dressing-glass, turning upon pivots on what had once
been a white and gilded frame. The chairs were of
richly-carved mahogany, without arms, the backs having
a lotus-like expansion outwards at the tops, and
the seats apparently the fruit of the same gentle labors
which had produced the quilt. By the bedside was
an elbow-chair, the brother of the one below, only this
was covered with white dimity. Upon a table in the
middle of the room I found my portmanteau, while
the open door of a closet on the right of the fireplace
displayed drawers already expanded for the hospitable
reception of my integuments. On the other side
of the fireplace was another closet, with a window
opening into it, with water and the appliances of the
toilet, and a shelf of books. The floor was covered
with a comfortable English carpet, and green damask
curtains hung heavily before the windows.</p>

<p>The gardens of Alcina would not have smiled more
invitingly upon me at that moment than did that
snug apartment. The extinguisher was soon on, and
I was luxuriously buried in a soft valley between two
mountains of down. I lay awake for a moment to

<!-- v2 page 57 -->

enjoy the sound of the winter's wind howling around
the house, and every now and then dashing the rain
against the windows with a fitful violence, and some
times roaring down the chimney, as if the fiend that
rode the blast were in vain clamoring for his prey.
These sounds, however, fell fainter and fainter upon
my weary ear, and I was soon fast asleep.</p>

<!-- v2 page 58 -->

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>I SLEPT soundly through a dreamless night, and
awoke about eight o'clock the next morning. I
was at a loss, for a minute or two, to define where on
earth I might be: soon, however, the scattered images
of the day and night before began to group themselves
palpably and distinctly in my recollection; and I
began to realize that I was actually beneath the roof
I had so strongly desired to visit. I sprang out of
bed, and, having learned the hour from my watch, I
despatched my toilet in all convenient haste. The
cheerful light of the sun, peeping through the oval
perforations in the tops of the window-shutters, informed
me before I left my couch, that the complexion
of the weather had changed since I had left the pelting,
pitiless storm roaring about the eaves, and gone
to the Land of Dreams. Upon opening the window-shutters
in the front of the house, I saw the scene
through which I had passed the night before in the
blackness of darkness, all bathed in the living light
of the blessed sun. The black, bare branches of the
superb elm-trees, which rose high above the roof, and
extended in two rows, one from each side of the house,
to the roadside, were dripping with raindrops glittering

<!-- v2 page 59 -->

in the morning ray. The brook, which I could
now perceive brawling along just beyond the house
on the right as I stood, was hurrying away to the sea,
its dancing waters crowning its brink, but not overflowing
it, black as ink in the shade, but of a translucent
amber-color where they were kissed</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"With touch ethereal of Heaven's fiery rod."</p>

</div>

<p>On the left of the house I plainly discerned the carriage-road,
which I had vainly sought the night before,
the trees extending a canopy of boughs over it. It
was separated from the lawn in front of the house by
an ancient hedge of boxwood cut into the fantastic
forms which were the delight of the English gardeners
of the old school, and which Pope has immortalized
by his satire, but which, nevertheless, my revered
friend scrupulously preserved as a memorial of former
times. The lawn was skirted on the other side by a
double row of the verdant fence which guarded it on
this. The lawn itself fell in a gentle slope, scarcely
perceptible, to the roadside, and was now buried beneath
the dishevelled tresses of the overarching trees,
ravished from them by the winds of autumn. A low
wooden fence, shielded on the outer side by a thick
hedge of English hawthorn, divided the lawn from
the high road.</p>

<p>These observations were soon made while my
toilet was making; and, as soon as it was finished, I
hastened down to the parlor below, which had witnessed
my hospitable reception. On entering the

<!-- v2 page 60 -->

room I saw that my venerable host was beforehand
with me, and that the breakfast-table was awaiting
my appearance. Colonel Wyborne was sitting by
the fireside in his elbow-chair, dressed as the evening
before, with the exception that a well-powdered bag-wig
had succeeded to the crown of his head in the
stead of the velvet cap of yesterday. He was busily
engaged in reading a large quarto, which I subsequently
discovered to be the Greek Testament, and
did not immediately perceive my entrance. I cheerfully
bade him good-morning, and desired him to
observe how punctiliously I had observed his parting
injunction to lie abed as long as I liked. He immediately
rose from his chair, and, having laid aside his
book, shook my hand cordially, and, bidding me good-morning,
thanked me for having made myself at
home; and all in a manner as if I were an honored
contemporary rather than a college lad, and with
that sterling courtesy of address which is the exponent
of true benevolence and kindliness of heart; a
very different thing from the base metal which too
often passes current in the world as the sterling coin,
but wanting the stamp of the heart. Compliments
being over, I drew a chair alongside of his, and answered
the careful inquiries which he made as to my
comfortable lodging the preceding night. His hospitable
anxiety on this subject being relieved, a touch
upon the bell-pull evoked our ministering spirits,
Peter and the housekeeper, from the culinary realms,
bearing in their hands the substantial and the more

<!-- v2 page 61 -->

ethereal components of that repast, which, when
well administered, deserves the precedence which is
conceded to it in the due order of the important
events of every day. The breakfast which these
worthy functionaries imposed upon the board bore
no resemblance to the tea-and-toast abominations
which usurp in these days that honored name, and
to the prevalence of which I attribute much of the
degeneracy which is allowed to have dwarfed the
present generation. Peter marshalled the way, bearing
upon a tray the massive silver coffee-pot, fuming
like a courser, and diffusing a fragrance worthy of
Araby the Blest. This monarch of the breakfast-table
was surrounded by a cortege of dishes temptingly
concealed from view by silver covers; which
when duly set in order, and revealed to sight, displayed
the luscious rounds of toast saturated with
the most delicious of butter, the broiled chickens,
the piquant sausages, the beefsteak, worthy of the
famous Club devoted to its service. Then there was
the egg-boiler full of the freshest of eggs, the honey,
the smoked salmon, the wheaten loaf and the rye-Indian
bread, the cream of the richest, and sugar of
the whitest. All these, and other cates which I do
not recollect, were all, too, for my especial eating;
for at the heels of Peter followed the housekeeper,
with a large silver salver, adorned with rich antique
chasing, upon which she bore an ample bowl of the
finest China, filled with a frothing sea of chocolate
and a certain number of slices of delicately toasted

<!-- v2 page 62 -->

wheaten bread, which was the long-established morning
meal of the master of the house.</p>

<p>When all preliminaries had been adjusted, we
commenced a well-directed and vigorously sustained
attack upon the several divisions to which we were
opposed, and soon effected a notable breach in the
opposite ranks. My host hospitably encouraged me
in my endeavors to do the amplest justice to his
good cheer, and enlivened the meal with a description
of the Scotch breakfasts which had cheered his
journey through the Land o' Cakes, which had not
then been transformed into a fairy-land of romance
and poetry by the magic wands of Burns and Scott,
but was regarded with the kind of belittling prejudice
which afterwards stamped the pages of Smollett,
and colored the mental vision of Johnson. He contrasted
those justly famed repasts, which have disarmed
even calumny and prejudice by their sterling
virtues, and have surprised even the bitterest enemies
into applause, with the <i>d&eacute;jeuners &agrave; la fourchette</i> of
France and the Continent, and gave the palm to the
substantial elements of the northern breakfasts over the
pat&eacute;s, grapes, figs, and sparkling wines of the south.
He had evidently given the subject the attention which
its importance deserved; and I have seldom had occasion
in my experience of life to doubt the soundness
of his opinions on this subject or any other.</p>

<p>After breakfast was over, and we had chatted
on various subjects for half an hour or so, Colonel
Wyborne proposed a walk over his farm, to which I

<!-- v2 page 63 -->

readily assented. Peter, being again summoned to
his master's assistance, helped him to substitute a
pearl-colored broadcloth coat, embroidered about the
cuffs and skirts with silk, for his morning-gown; and
having invested his feet with a stout pair of square-toed,
high-quartered shoes with heavy heels, he
brought from the hall his gold-laced cocked hat and
gold-headed cane. Thus equipped, my venerable
friend took my arm, and we sallied forth from the
side door opening upon the carriage-way, and first
took a survey of the exterior of the house. It was
composed, in fact, of two houses of two different
periods: the newer, as it were, growing out of and
overshadowing the more ancient. The English clergyman,
of whose heirs I have before said the estate
was purchased by Colonel Wyborne's mother, had
found a farmhouse of almost the earliest description
of New England rural architecture; its roof declining
from two stories in front till it almost touched
the ground behind, and a close porch projecting before,
with windows on either side, and compacted
of massy timbers of oak, on which the mark of the
axe was in many places to be seen, knit together
with a firmness and strength which showed that
our forefathers built for their posterity as well as for
themselves. The wooden walls of our ancestors
would, if unmolested, survive, I doubt not, in many
cases, the boasted strength of the granite structures
of the present day. The original purchaser liking
the situation of the house, but not thinking it

<!-- v2 page 64 -->

worthy of his pretensions, built a new edifice, two
stories high, with attics; its rear joining upon the
side of the older structure, so that the original house
was degraded into the servile condition of the habitation
and offices of the servants. He in this way
secured to himself an abode of capacious dimensions
and convenient distribution, but somewhat of a
heterogeneous appearance. The carriage-road, in
which we were walking, turned abruptly away from
the house before it had reached the end of it, and
swept round a circle of trees and towering plants to
the stables, which were, in the leafy time, effectually
planted out of sight by the verdant screen. Immediately
behind the house was a broad terrace of green
sod, from which you descended, by a flight of stone
steps with iron balustrades, to the garden. The
transitory glories of this spot were of course vanished
for this year; but the plan of the whole was
plainly enough discernible. In the centre of the
garden was a small fish-pond, with a neat stone
curbing, which was filled with gold and silver fish.
Immediately in front of the fish-pond was an ancient
sun-dial standing upon a pedestal of stone, and
preaching a lesson, by its silent shadow, of the
irrevocable flight of the gliding hours, a thousand
times more impressive than any told by</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"The iron tongue of Time."</p>

</div>

<p>From the fish-pond as the common centre, radiated
eight well-gravelled walks, extending from the centre

<!-- v2 page 65 -->

to the boundaries, and intersecting a circular gravel
walk which was described with mathematical exactness,
halfway from the central point to the extremities
of the garden. The sixteen portions thus marked
out were of exactly the same size; and in summer,
when they were filled with flowers or vegetables
corresponding to each other, must have answered
Pope's description of an old-fashioned garden, where</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Each alley has a brother,<br/>

And half the platform just reflects the other."</p>

</div>

<p>The garden was surrounded by a thick English hawthorn
hedge, which by age and constant trimming
had become almost impervious to sight, even when
stripped of its leaves. At the bottom of the garden
a small gate admitted us into the orchard, which
was of several acres in extent, and filled with apple
and pear trees of every variety of sweetness and
spicy flavor which distinguishes those gentle races.
Of his fruit Colonel Wyborne was proud, with good
reason; for he had done much to introduce new
varieties, and a better mode of cultivation than used
to prevail. The orchard, and the whole domain
indeed, was sheltered from the ocean blasts by a
gently swelling hill, "feathering to the top" with a
thick grove of various trees, which had now reached
their full growth, having been planted by the first
purchaser, with the exception of one magnificent
aboriginal oak, which stood in the midst of the
younger trees an acknowledged monarch, and which

<!-- v2 page 66 -->

had not yet disrobed itself of the gorgeous scarlet
mantle with which autumn had invested it. Under
this regal canopy there was a rustic seat, which
allured us to its embraces. My aged companion
seated himself upon it, while I took my place beside
him, and we surveyed together in silence the brown
meadows, and the trees with every bough and every
twig standing sharply out, with all their fantastic
ramifications, in the yellow sunshine of one of the
last days of the Indian summer.</p>

<p>"There is something exceedingly captivating to
my imagination," my venerable friend began, after a
silence of some duration, "in the analogies between
nature and the experience of human life. These
you will apprehend and appreciate more and more as
you grow older. They are among the many benevolent
contrivances of the great Author of nature and
life to make the never-dying soul contented and
cheerful during its brief imprisonment in these frail
bodies and this visible diurnal sphere. When I was
of your age, I loved the spring with its budding
promise and tender green; for it was in unison with
the consciousness of new life and springing existence
which bounded in every vein. During my residence
in England, and for the first years of my life here, I
left my first love for the mature beauties of summer
and of opening autumn; and I delighted to watch
the untiring, never-resting activity and life which
informed all the grand and all the minute processes
of the great system of nature, which goes on forever

<!-- v2 page 67 -->

in sublime silence, working out the beneficent purposes
for which its Creator framed it. But now the
close of autumn and the snows of winter awake
the solemn echo in my heart more readily than all
the glories of spring or summer. Nature, though she
never rests, now seems to suspend her toils. The
business of the year is over. And the audible stillness
of the fields and the sight of the trees,&mdash;which,
after their task is done, have thrown down the beautiful
livery of their toil,&mdash;while they swell the heart
of man with gratitude, also seem to invite it to rest.</p>

<p>"On such a day as this, with this scene before my
eyes, I can almost hear a blessed voice whispering
me that my long, long year is almost over, and that I
shall soon be with them that rest. Like this old tree
under which we sit, I have outlived almost all my
contemporaries, and am surrounded by a new generation,
which knows me not; and, though I will gratefully
sustain the burden of old age which the great
Taskmaker has imposed upon me, still I shall bow
with joyful acquiescence whenever he shall direct
the axe to be laid at my root."</p>

<p>"You think, then, sir," I observed when he paused
in his observations, or rather his soliloquy, for he
seemed to address himself rather than me,&mdash;"you
think, then, sir, that the retirement of a country life
is a more fitting scene for the last act of a long life
than the exciting bustle of a great city and the pleasures
of a various society?"</p>

<p>"To a well-constituted mind," he replied, "I think

<!-- v2 page 68 -->

it is; that is," he continued with a smile, "to a mind
constituted like mine. There are natures which
would show anything but wisdom in exchanging the
busy throng and a tumultuous life for a solitude for
the pleasures of which they have no tastes, and against
the perils of which they have made no preparation.
For my own part, I have never long regretted at any
one time my withdrawing from the world. I have
spent my many days pleasantly to myself, and not
been wholly useless to others. At the beginning of
the Revolution, indeed, I felt some visitings of remorse
that I had reduced myself to the condition of
a spectator, at a distance only, of that mighty drama;
while so many of my contemporaries, and friends of
a later generation, were shaking the scene, which was
extended over a continent, before the admiring eye
of the whole civilized world. These regrets, however,
soon gave way to more wholesome suggestions. The
brilliant part of the action was in the hands of the
great men whose names are forever identified with it;
but there was a subordinate but equally important
portion of the business of the drama which I was in
a favorable position to discharge. My relations with
this part of the country enabled me to do something
towards kindling and keeping alive the flame of patriotism;
and I have the satisfaction to think that I
was enabled to send many of the best soldiers and
officers, too, to the battle, besides keeping the countryside
in a state of self-defence. I could contribute,
too, to one of the sinews of war. So I soon consoled

<!-- v2 page 69 -->

myself by being useful for not being illustrious; for
ambition was but an idle dream at the time of life to
which I had then attained, if it be ever anything
more than a will-o'-the-wisp. On the whole, then,
I think that I chose wisely for myself in retiring
from the world; but I would never advise any person
whose heart has not been weaned from it to imitate
my example."</p>

<p>"But can it be possible, sir," I said, "that you
have never felt the want of the society to which you
were admitted on such friendly terms in Europe? I
should have thought, sir, that the choicest spirits you
could have collected around you in the capital of your
native province would have seemed tame and insipid
after the circles you had left, let alone this seclusion
in a remote country-seat."</p>

<p>"In the first place," he replied, "you must remember
that I had had my fill of the society you mention:
I had lived on intimate and friendly terms with the
men about whom posterity will be the most curious
of any of our age; so that the feverish thirst which
at one time I felt to know face to face those illustrious
men was entirely slaked. And in the second
place, which perhaps you will scarcely believe, the
familiar society of eminent men is in most cases not
so very different from that of other well-bred and
well-educated men of the same rank in life, and their
intimacy is perhaps a pleasanter thing in recollection
than in possession. For many years, too, I was in no
lack of companions, and now in my old age I ought

<!-- v2 page 70 -->

not to expect to be exempted from the doom of outliving
my best friends, which is inseparably annexed
to an unusual extension of life. Still I am by no
means left alone in the world. My excellent friend
Mr. Armsby is an invaluable friend: although he is
speculatively one of the most rigid disciples of labor,
yet in his life and conversation he is one of the
mildest as well as one of the merriest of men. But
come," he continued, rising from his seat, "let us continue
our walk to the seashore."</p>

<p>We accordingly skirted along the hill, and soon,
doubling its side, the wide ocean lay stretched before
us, broken by only one or two little islands in the far
distance. The waters were of the deepest and darkest
blue, with here and there a white sail stealing along
their surface. The beach was hard as marble; and
the surf, which yet felt the sway of the storm of the
night before, rolled slowly and heavily in upon it in
long and broken ridges. To our left, at about a quarter
of a mile's distance, the brook which watered the
grounds about the house found its way to the ocean
after many meanderings: to the right, at a considerable
distance, a wooded bluff came abruptly down to
the shore, and terminated the prospect in that direction.
As we slowly paced along the sands, listening
to the voice of many waters, and watching the sea
gulls as they hovered on dipping wings over the
waves, or rode lightly over their crests, Colonel
Wyborne said with a smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope that I have made a more rational as well

<!-- v2 page 71 -->

as a more happy use of these rolling waters since I
have lived by their side than did the pining and
discontented spirit of Tully during his exile, who,
you remember, spent his repining hours in counting
the waves as they danced to the shore, and sighing
for the Senate, the forum, and the shouts of the people&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'Bidding the father of his country hail.'</p>

</div>

<p>The voice of the ocean has never sounded in my ears
like an invitation to return to the world I have left,
but more as a friendly counselling that there are pursuits
and pleasures higher and better than any that
world can give."</p>

<p>"Do you think, sir," I inquired, "that you could
be contented to live in an inland town, unless you
could occasionally visit the seashore?"</p>

<p>"I should be sorry," he replied, "to be compelled
by duty or by poverty to try the experiment. There
is something about the grand features of Nature,
such as the ocean or mountains, which seems to
make an unfading impression on the hearts of those
who have lived from childhood in their neighborhood,
and which always excites the sensation of home-sickness
in their breasts when separated from them. I
have a good deal of the passion for the ocean which
the Swiss have for the Alps; and, if I should be compelled
to retire inland, I fear that the roar of the wind
among the forest-trees would be a <i>Ranz des V&acirc;ches</i> to
my heart. I would not have you construe, however,
my young friend, my complacent review of my own

<!-- v2 page 72 -->

retirement into a recommendation to you to try the
same plan of life. Fit yourself for the action of life,
but do not set your heart upon success in it; for such
are the chances and changes of this sublunary state,
that the best accomplished for achieving a brilliant
lot often fail in compassing the fulfilment of their
ambitious hopes, unless they can woo fortune to be
the handmaid of enterprise."</p>

<p>"Are not, however," I observed, "the chances of a
man who is absorbed in great purposes and plans,
embracing, perhaps, a continent in their scope, and
reaching forward to distant posterity, better for true
and exalted happiness than those of one who leads a
useful and innocent life within a narrow circle?"</p>

<p>"I think his chances for permanent happiness less,"
replied Colonel Wyborne. "His moments of success
may be more exquisite than any of the tranquil hours
of the private man; but then the vexations and obstacles
which he encounters, the calumny and detraction
which assail him, and the too frequent failure
of his best laid and most benevolently formed plans,
which perhaps embrace the whole race, make up a
mighty balance against the intense delight of those
rare minutes. I grant you that there may be instances,
as there have been a few in history, of minds so constructed,
blest with such clear views of the true ends
of human existence, and moved by such pure and
sublime yet simple springs, that they make a happiness
for themselves, even of disappointment and defeat,
and regard nothing as worthy of regret but

<!-- v2 page 73 -->

the being unfaithful to the powers and the purposes
which Providence has committed to them."</p>

<p>"You do not believe, then, sir," said I, "that every
man may be the 'architect of his own fortunes,' as
has been stoutly maintained?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do not," he replied. "That is a fallacy
which lures on many an aspiring youth, who mistakes
ambition for ability, to miserable disappointment, and
sometimes to ruin. We see men standing triumphantly
at the goal with the wreath of victory on their brows,
and remember, that, even at the starting-post, their
prophetic souls had grasped the prize; forgetting how
many competitors, full at the outset of as confident
hopes, have been outstripped in the course, and have
turned broken hearted away. Every man may be and
must be the architect of his own happiness, and every
man may learn the alchemy which will teach him to
extract happiness out of the bitterest fruits which
overhang his path; but let him not attempt to wrest
the sceptre from the hand of the Disposer of events,
and presume to dictate to him the precedence which
he is to have in the ranks of his human servants."</p>

<p>"Surely, sir," I interrupted, "you are not a fatalist!
You would not take away the accountability of man
by making him a mere blind, helpless tool in the
hand of a higher Power?"</p>

<p>"Nothing can be farther from my views or my
wishes," he replied. "Man is accountable to the uttermost
farthing for the use he makes of the talents
bestowed upon him; but the number of the talents

<!-- v2 page 74 -->

and the sphere in which they are to be employed
are fortunately appointed for him by Infinite Wisdom.
We find ourselves in this world, in this country, in
this age, without any agency or volition of our own;
we find within us certain powers and passions, differing
in every man from his neighbor, and differing,
too, in the opportunities for their improvement and
the occasions for their right or wrong employment;
and all this seems to be the work of accident. But no
rightly judging mind can believe it to be so. The feeling
of this truth gave rise to belief in, the dark and
inevitable fate, which, according to the Greeks, governed
the destinies of gods and men. They attempted
by this melancholy abstraction to solve the enigma of
existence. They found themselves, they knew not how,
in a various and inexplicable scene. Some found
crowns on their brows; some, the philosophic gown
upon their shoulders; some wielded the truncheon of
victorious armies; and some swayed the fickle populace
with their breath&mdash;and all these various fortunes
growing from a combination of circumstances and
events over which they had exercised little or no
control. Surrounded by these impenetrable shadows,
men in a later age attempted to derive some light
from the stars to illuminate the darkness which was
about them; and so astrology arose. They made the
blessed constellations an alphabet by which they
endeavored to spell out the decrees of fate. And this
was natural enough before the invention of the telescope
had revealed the immensity of the universe;

<!-- v2 page 75 -->

for men could not believe that the glorious apparitions
which looked down upon them from the heavens
every night were made only to delight the eye; and
there was something soothing to the bewildered mind
of man in thus connecting his unaccountable destiny
with those beautiful and fadeless orbs of light. It was
a sort of antepast of immortality."</p>

<p>"You would then, sir," I observed, "had you lived
two thousand years ago, have stood under the shadow
of the Portico, and maintained the non-existence of
evil and the sufficiency of man for himself?"</p>

<p>"I believe I might have asserted the sufficiency of
man for the creation of his own happiness," he smilingly
replied; "but I think I should have maintained
my doctrines beneath the living shades of the Garden
rather than under the cold shadow of the Porch.
There is nothing," he continued more seriously, "that
fills my whole mind with such a certainty of the
divine origin of our religion as the contemplation of
its perfect system in comparison with those of the
wisest of the ancients. The son of a carpenter in a
remote and despised province founding a school of the
divinest philosophy, which explains all the mysteries
of our being, fathoms the depths of the human soul,
directs the aspirations of the loftiest minds, and provides
for the wants of the humblest, is to my mind a
standing miracle. All the concentrated wisdom of all
the wisest of the heathens collected around the intellect
of Socrates as a nucleus, faded into nothing, like
the morning star before the sun, when the divine

<!-- v2 page 76 -->

mind of Jesus of Nazareth dawned upon the benighted
world. Not all the sublime procession of prophets by
which he was heralded, not all the stupendous apparatus
of miracles which encompassed him, not all the
noble army of martyrs which have borne witness with
their blood to the truths he brought to light, bring
such irresistible conviction to my mind as the simple
contemplation of the teachings of the Master, limned
out in his own life while on earth. The peasant of
Galilee resolves the doubts which had perplexed the
wisest of antiquity, explains the questions which the
subtlest minds had raised, and establishes a system
suitable to the wants of all the nations of the earth
and to all the individuals which compose them,&mdash;a
system to which the wisest of his disciples in the
course of eighteen hundred years have been able to
add nothing, and in which his craftiest enemies have
been able to discover no fault. You, my dear young
friend," he continued, turning his face towards me,
and laying an affectionate hand upon my arm, "you are
just launching away on the voyage of life which I
have nearly finished. Do not refuse to listen to the
counsel of one who has sounded all its depths and
shallows: take with you the teachings of Jesus as
your compass, and his life as your chart, and, fixing
your eyes steadfastly on these unchanging guides,
seize the helm with a firm hand, and steer right onward,
fearing nothing that can befall you; and then,
whether your course be over a summer's sea or amidst
threatening waves, whether you ride conspicuous in

<!-- v2 page 77 -->

the eyes of your fellow-voyagers, or glide unobserved
along, you will be sure at last of entering in triumph
the haven of everlasting rest.</p>

<p>"And now come," he added after a short pause,
"let us turn homeward, and I will show you my
farmhouse and farm; for so far you have only seen
my pleasure-grounds."</p>

<p>With these words he turned towards the farm-road
into which we had entered after leaving the grove;
and, following it along, it led us through wide fields,
some of which showed as stubble-fields are apt to do
at harvest-home: others bore evident marks of the
recent disinterment of potatoes and other esculent
roots. At some distance was a burly white man, guiding
a plough drawn by a noble yoke of oxen under the
influences of a tall black man in a white frock, preparing
a place for the early wheat, which would spring
up at the due time, unchilled by the snows of winter
which had rested upon it for months. Five or six
other men, some black and some white, were employed
in various ways; some repairing fences, some spreading
the compost of the barnyard, and one conducting
a load of seaweed to that most necessary repository.</p>

<p>As we walked along, I inquired of Colonel Wyborne
as to the economics of his mode of life, and how far
he was dependent on the metropolis for his necessaries
and luxuries. In reply, he told me that he procured
nothing from town but his wines, liquors, tea and
coffee, and such products as our own country does not
afford. His own farm supplied him with bread, vegetables,

<!-- v2 page 78 -->

the riches of the dairy, and in a great measure
with butchers' meat and poultry. Wild fowl and fish
were to be had for the trouble of shooting or catching
them. His cider was the boast of the country round.
His farm-people and servants were almost wholly
clothed from the flax and wool which grew on his
estate. His wood was procured from a range of well-timbered
hills, which he pointed out to me in the
distance. The finest of venison was brought to his
door at the proper season, in any quantities, from the
Sandwich woods. His life, as he described it to me,
seemed to be one of the most relishing and enviable
of lots, and put me in mind of Gil Blas' account of
his life at Lirias; and I thought that I should be
perfectly contented if I might look forward at the
close of life to such a retreat, where I might inscribe
upon my doors, with him of Santillane,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Inveni portum, Spes et Fortuna, valete!<br/>

Sat me lusistis, ludite nunc alios!"</p>

<p>But, alas! no such white days were in reserve for me.</p>

<p>The farm-road brought us, after some windings
among the fields, to his farmhouse, which was situated
about a third of a mile from his mansion. The
house was old, but in perfect repair, and stood in
almost too immediate neighborhood of two modern
barns and an old-fashioned corn-barn. The barnyard
was alive with fowls of all kinds&mdash;chickens, turkeys,
ducks, guinea-fowl, and a gorgeous peacock. Beneath
the barn farthest from the farmhouse was the piggery,

<!-- v2 page 79 -->

which might have served for the courtiers of Circe
herself. The barns themselves were filled to the
utmost of their ample capacities with the gifts of
summer and autumn. About a dozen cows were ruminating
in a large enclosure opening from the nearer
barn, in which were their stalls and those of the
farm-horses. A flock of about thirty sheep were sheltered
in a fold about a stone's throw from the barn,
towards the shore. Under a shed open towards the
house was a cider-press, full of rural and festive associations;
the dense mass of pomace yet remaining
beneath the relaxed pressure of the spiral screw speaking
of a recent vintage. As we approached the farmhouse
door, it opened, and the farmer's wife advanced,
with a child in her arms and a couple more clinging
to her homespun gown, peeping at the Colonel with a
mixture of bashfulness and of joy at the sight of their
old friend glowing in their ruddy faces. The good
woman invited us to come in and rest ourselves,
which proposition we declined, as it grew late. We
just entered the kitchen, and stood for a minute
within the enormous jambs of the chimney, on each
side of which was a comfortable seat of brick, built
for the accommodation of the more ardent worshippers
of the Penates. A settle of truly uneasy straightness
of back and narrowness of seat made an obtuse angle
with the fireplace, covered with towels of various degrees
of whiteness and dryness. A sufficient supply
of rush-bottomed, red-painted chairs, in different
degrees of preservation, stood about the apartment.

<!-- v2 page 80 -->

A brilliant display of pewter graced a number of
shelves on one side of the room. As I gave a glance
up the yawning chimney, I discerned a black array of
hams and flitches of bacon receiving the incense
of the smoking fires below. The good woman made
many apologies for her kitchen being in a litter,
resting her main defence, however, upon its being the
day before Thanksgiving, and the weight of duties
which devolved upon her. Colonel Wyborne was
occupied, while I was making my survey, and listening
to the very unnecessary excuses of the good wife,
in taking the youngest child in his arms, and patting
the heads of the others, and distributing some of the
little bribes which cheaply buy the affection of children,
and which the kind-hearted old man was seldom
without. I was struck with the sort of affectionate
veneration with which the good woman regarded Colonel
Wyborne, and with her self-respect, too, which
she thought in no manner impaired by the most reverential
observance of her kind landlord.</p>

<p>Freeing himself at last from his little friends, Colonel
Wyborne bade Mrs. Davis a good-morning, and
we set forth on our return to his house. The farm-road
led us on to the stables, where we stopped a
moment to inspect its arrangements. The black
coachman was busy cleaning the chariot; the hind
wheel, slightly raised from the ground, whirling merrily
round under a shower from a watering-pot in the
hands of the African Jehu. This worthy functionary
had all the happy contentment beaming from his

<!-- v2 page 81 -->

polished face, and grinning from his ivory teeth,
which usually marks a well-fed and well-used negro.
His master told me that he had been born on the place,
and, together with all the other blacks which he had
owned before the abolition of slavery in the State,
had voluntarily remained in his service. He left his
work to exhibit to my admiring gaze the horses over
which he reigned; and as he displayed the glossy
hides of the stout coach-horses, and the little nag for
"massa's" own riding, and the old white pony which
had retired on half-pay for the remainder of his life,
he seemed to be filled with as honest a pride as ever
swelled the bosom of a master of the horse. Having
bestowed all due commendations upon this branch of
the service, I accompanied my host along the sweep
of the road to the house.</p>

<p>Upon gaining the door, we were met upon the
threshold by the excellent housekeeper, who announced,
with an air of no small importance, that
Mr. Armsby, the clergyman of the parish, was in the
parlor. Colonel Wyborne immediately hastened to
open the door of the apartment indicated, and we
perceived, standing with his back to the fire, waiting
for us, the reverend gentleman in question. He was
a tall man of about fifty-five, "or, by'r Lady, inclining
to threescore," broad-shouldered, with the least
in the world of a stoop, of a dark complexion, with
thick black eyebrows beetling over a pair of sharp,
austere gray eyes. He was suitably attired in a
black cloth coat, waistcoat, and breeches, with a

<!-- v2 page 82 -->

pair of thick boots coming nearly up to the knee
upon his legs, and a white bushy wig upon the excrescence
formed by nature for that use. Colonel
Wyborne received him with all the respectful courtesy
which was due from a gentleman to an honored
equal, and which the pastor returned with much
formal politeness; through which, however, might be
discerned by an accurate observer a priestly consequentiality,
now, alas! but seldom seen, which told
how much superior, in his own opinion and that of
society generally, was the director of the spiritual
affairs over the most honorable and honored of the
laity. When the two gentlemen had concluded their
salutations, Colonel Wyborne, turning to me, presented
me in due form to his reverend friend as a
young gentleman just from the arms of their common
mother. Mr. Armsby, turning upon me an austere
regard, without even the ghost of a smile upon his
lips, and with the slightest imaginable inclination of
his head, coldly extended his large hard hand to me in
acknowledgment of my reverend observance and profound
obeisance. Having surveyed me from head to
foot with an annihilating scrutiny which nearly sunk
me to the centre, he took a chair, in compliance with
Colonel Wyborne's invitation, and, entering into conversation
with him, apparently lost all memory of so
insignificant an object as myself. They talked of
the weather, the crops, the Thursday lecture the week
before in Boston (which Mr. Armsby had attended),
and of the fearful prospects of the times and of the

<!-- v2 page 83 -->

country; both uniting in predictions of utter misrule,
subversion of ranks, and destruction of property,
which were shortly to ensue.</p>

<p>"Before this young man's career is over," said
Colonel Wyborne, "these States will be split into
rival monarchies, or else into anarchies inviting the
foot of the foreign conqueror."</p>

<p>"Yes," asserted his reverend adviser, turning his
severe eyes upon me,&mdash;"yes, young man, you will
have a worse fight to maintain than we have had
with England. You will have to contend with intestine
factions, to strive for the protection of property,
for the preservation of religion, for the maintenance
of all that is worth having in this world. The old
scenes of which you read at college in Grecian and
Roman history will be acted over again in these new
commonwealths before your head is gray."</p>

<p>"For my part," added Colonel Wyborne, "I rather
incline to the opinion that our unhappy country is
destined to be one of the dependencies of France.
In the present humiliated condition of England,&mdash;bleeding
from the disruption of her Colonies, and
tottering under the weight of an overwhelming debt,&mdash;it
is hardly to be supposed that Louis XVI. will not
be encouraged to revive the old scheme of universal
dominion which his ancestor, Louis le Grand, at one
time seemed likely to bring about. England once
subdued, the subjugation of the rest of the continent
would soon follow, and then poor we would be but
a mouthful to the ambition of the <i>Grand Monarque</i>."</p>

<!-- v2 page 84 -->

<p>"True enough," replied Mr. Armsby. "No human
wisdom can foretell what such a nation as the French,
consolidated under a single absolute king, may accomplish.
I confess I tremble for the cause of Protestantism
in the world. Who knows but we may see
a cardinal legate holding his court in Boston!" And
the worthy divine shuddered at the bare imagination.
Colonel Wyborne continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think that the American Provinces, States, I
mean, have yet strength and courage enough to resist
a crusade under banners blessed by the Pope; unless,
indeed, it should not be preached until our little jealousies
and quarrels have ripened into serious hatred,
and the lines of division have become too deeply
marked to be filled up even by such a danger. The
sooner such an attack should be made, the better
I think it would be withstood; for every day seems
to weaken the green withes which bind together the
strong but jarring giants of the Confederacy. In a
few years England herself might conquer us in detail,
for all prospect of any permanent connection seems
desperate."</p>

<p>"It is too true," replied the clergyman; "and, bad
as that would be, it would scarcely be worse than the
utter dissolution of all the elements of society, which
seems to hang over our heads. The industry of the
country palsied, the land filled with sturdy vagabonds,
law and justice mocked and defied, subordination
a laughing-stock, religion and her ministers
neglected, property uncertain, magistrates unrevered

<!-- v2 page 85 -->

and disobeyed,&mdash;with all these things staring us in
the face, what can we expect but sudden destruction
or gradual ruin?"</p>

<p>In this manner were these two excellent gentlemen
pleased to make themselves unhappy, and to scare
unhappy me with these hobgoblins which they conjured
up. I was not then as used as I have become
since to the croakings of such boding fowl,&mdash;which I
have happily lived to see many times disappointed
of the ruin they predicted,&mdash;and I felt serious alarm
as to the instant safety of my purse, and ultimate integrity
of my throat. The conversation, however, at
length changed to books; and, some allusion requiring
a reference to some work which was not at hand,
Mr. Armsby proposed going to the library in search
of it. Colonel Wyborne, assenting, turned to me and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe that you have not yet penetrated to my
adytum: so perhaps we will all go together."</p>

<p>We all accordingly left the parlor, and, following
Colonel Wyborne across the hall, entered after him a
door on the opposite side. Upon passing the threshold,
I was surprised and delighted by a display of
books which I had never seen equalled except in the
college library. The library consisted of a room
extending the whole breadth of the house; the two
rooms having been thrown into one for the accommodation
of Colonel Wyborne's numerous collections.
The walls were covered with well-filled shelves, tapering
up from the massive folios beneath to the pygmy

<!-- v2 page 86 -->

twelves at the top. Busts in marble of Homer, Socrates,
Cicero, and Horace, stood on pedestals in the four
corners of the room; and one of Lord Bacon and of
Newton kept guard in the middle, where a portion
of the old partition-wall yet projected from the sides
of the rooms, carried into an arch in the centre of
the ceiling. A study-table, covered with green baize,
occupied the middle of one of these divisions. An
abundance of well-stuffed chairs were distributed
about in excusable confusion, and a set of library-steps
stood against one of the bookcases. A fireplace
filled up either end of the apartment; the
panel over the one nearest to the door by which we
had entered being occupied by a full-length portrait
of a gentleman of about five and thirty, in whose
form and features I could with difficulty trace any
resemblance to the venerable wreck which I beheld
before me. Fifty years had swept away almost every
trace of the manly figure and handsome face which
looked as if it might defy age and misfortune, and
left a "withered, weak, and gray" old man standing
and waiting on the shores of eternity; and yet here
the cunning hand of the artist had bade the sun as it
were stand still, and had bestowed a sort of immortality
upon one hour&mdash;long since vanished&mdash;of the
summer of his days. He was dressed in a hunting-suit,
apparently the uniform of a hunter; and a fine
hound was crouched at his feet. Behind him on the
left of the picture were two pillars, with a crimson
curtain depending from their capitals; while to the

<!-- v2 page 87 -->

right you saw a landscape representing a level country,
well planted, with a river winding through it,
and terminated by misty hills in the distance. The
corresponding panel over the opposite fireplace was
filled by a picture answering in size and frame to
this, but concealed from view by a green velvet curtain
which was drawn across it. My imagination
readily filled it up with the portrait of his beloved
and long-lost wife of whom my aunt Champion had
told me. Why it should be thus mysteriously veiled,
I could not conjecture; but the circumstance certainly
had the effect of increasing my curiosity to see
it to the most intense degree.</p>

<p>While I was thus engaged, the two elders had
found what they wanted, and were returning to the
parlor. I was strongly tempted to frame some excuse
for remaining behind; but a secret awe of the clerical
dignitary, and a fear lest my curiosity might be
obvious to Colonel Wyborne and give him pain,
deterred me; but I fully resolved to uncover the features
concealed by that veil at the first opportunity I
could find or make. We accordingly returned to the
parlor; and, after a short sitting, Mr. Armsby rose and
took his leave, being accompanied to the hall-door
by Colonel Wyborne and myself, and reminded by
the former of his standing engagement to dine with
him on the following day. This was the first intimation
I had had of the existence of such a prescription;
and, lover as I even then was of old customs,
I confess that in this instance I should have been

<!-- v2 page 88 -->

better pleased with its breach than its observance.
I did not at all relish the idea of having this uncomfortable
third, with his stony step and hard eye,
coming to the table, and displacing our mirth with
his unseasonable severity. Colonel Wyborne, however,
assured me that I should find him another man
when we were a little better acquainted, saying that
his excellent friend was one of that old school, which
held that religion and virtue were most effectually
recommended to the young by a harsh and forbidding
exterior and deportment in their votaries.</p>

<p>"To-day," he added, "you have had a touch of his
theory: to-morrow, I doubt not, you will see a specimen
of his practice."</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>DINNER soon followed the departure of the pastor,
and was sauced with discourse which I
would that my limits would permit me to record.
The afternoon and evening passed swiftly away, sped
by "old wine, old books, old wood," and an "old
friend." At an earlier hour than the preceding
night, the chamber candles lighted us to bed, and
my hospitable host shook me by the hand with a
cordial good-night. After he had retired, I felt but
little inclination for repose, and, as a good fire was
blazing on the hearth, I procured a volume of Swift
from the closet of my room, and sat down by the
fireside to read. My thoughts, however, soon wandered
from the page on which my eyes were fixed,
and began to brood over the strangeness of the place
in which I found myself and the singular history of
my kind old host. I figured to myself the stripling
parting from his mother's roof, and seeking the land
of his ancestors. Then I saw him in the midst of
the stir and bustle of London, and imagined his first
palpitating interviews with Pope and Young and
Gay. Then I would see him mixing in the hollow
crowd of courtiers in the great man's antechamber,
or joining in the fluttering throng which passed

<!-- v2 page 90 -->

in review before the old monarch on a birthday,&mdash;that
throng whose follies and vices are portrayed
in fadeless colors upon the pages of Lady Mary
Wortley.</p>

<p>The scene changed, and he was sitting between a
couple of haycocks with Bolingbroke at Lydiard,
or was listening to a chapter of pointed complainings
at Pope's breakfast-table, or was chased up and
down stairs by the Dean of St. Patrick. Another
wave of the wand transported him to Paris, and
plunged him in the recesses of the Palais Royal;
and yet another, and he stood among the ruins of
Rome. Again he was in England, and then came
a mist over the mirror, and objects were but faintly
and uncertainly seen in it. Among them, however,
was a beautiful woman moving about, and busy with
his destiny. She was now sitting alone in an old
manor-house, gazing listlessly at the trees of the park
as they spread their green canopies over the herds
of deer, and at a single swan floating majestically in
the stream which flowed beneath them. A sound is
heard: she raises her head from her pensive hand,
and shakes back her clustering locks, and eagerly
listens. It is the tread of a horse galloping up the
approach. She hastily rises, and with faltering steps
advances towards the door. It opens, and Wyborne
enters. Her gestures seem to entreat him to hasten
away, for there is danger in his stay. He re-assures
her with looks of joyful love. And now he seats
himself by her side; her head droops upon his

<!-- v2 page 91 -->

shoulder, and her passive hand rests in one of his,
while the other, half-encircling her waist, plays with
the tangles of her hair. Can there be any doubt as
to the theme of their glowing discourse? But hark!
What noise is that in the courtyard? Is it possible
that the chase can be over? They both start up.
She entreats him to fly: he moodily shakes his head.
It is too late. The door flies open. A gray-haired
man, but hale and ruddy, and of Herculean proportions,
enters. He starts&mdash;turns pale with rage:
his lips move with dire imprecations. His sword is
out, and he advances furiously upon Wyborne, who
puts his blade aside with his sheathed rapier. The
old man stamps with passion, and seems to call for
help. A train of liveried menials enter, and at
their master's beck approach the intruder. Wyborne
gently disengages himself from the clinging girl, and
tenderly places her fainting form upon a couch.
His steel glitters in the air. He describes around
him a magic circle, which the baffled crew dare not
pass. The door closes behind him, and, before the
dependents can ask the further pleasure of their lord,
the clang of his horse's hoofs is heard lessening in the
distance.</p>

<p>Then again I saw them riding over the waves of
the Atlantic, and I beheld her gentle form pining
away on a distant shore, perhaps under the fatal ban
of a father's curse&mdash;and then her funeral.</p>

<p>"I must see her picture before I sleep!" I exclaimed,
starting up, strongly excited by my waking

<!-- v2 page 92 -->

dream. "I must gaze upon her lovely features as
they are feebly shadowed forth on the canvas below,
or the phantom I have conjured up will haunt me
till dawn." I opened the door softly, and listened:
all was silent as the grave. I took off my shoes, and,
snuffing my candle, prepared to descend. I have to
confess that I was not at that time of my life free
from the fumes of the superstitious lore which in my
boyish days formed the chosen aliment of childhood,
and which was employed by the ignorant nurses of
those days both as a reward and a punishment. I
own my curiosity more than half gave way when the
hall-clock struck TWELVE as I was groping my way
down stairs. I reached the library-door; my hand
was upon the lock: I hesitated for a moment, and
looked hastily over my shoulder. The lock turned,
and, as the door slowly opened, I felt as if I should
encounter some spectral form in the deserted apartment.
All was still, however, and nothing was to
be seen as I advanced into the room, but the white,
ghastly busts in the middle of it, casting long black
sepulchral shadows into the void beyond. I advanced
stealthily along, shading my flickering candle
with my hand, when I was suddenly startled with a
shock and a noise. I had stumbled over a chair.
Apprehensive lest the noise should alarm the house,
I returned hastily to the door, and listened. But
no sound broke the dead silence of the night, and I
returned with more cautious steps to pursue my
way. At last I stood before the mysterious curtain

<!-- v2 page 93 -->

which concealed the features of the long-buried fair.
I felt strangely excited; I felt as if some appearance,
natural or supernatural, would yet baffle my curiosity.
The mantel-piece was so high, that I was
unable to reach the curtain from the ground, and,
putting down my light, I went in search of the
library-steps, which I carefully arranged before the
fireplace. Taking up the candlestick, I mounted
the steps, and laid my hand upon the fringe of the
curtain, and was in the act of withdrawing it, when
I heard a rustling sound behind me. Turning suddenly
around, I saw before me an apparition, which
in such a place and at such an hour might well have
daunted a stouter heart than mine. A figure in white
drapery falling to its feet, a white covering upon its
head, and its pale and withered features lighted
up by a taper held in its long bony fingers, was
looking sadly yet sternly upon me. My candle
dropped from my hand, and I was near falling to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Young man, what do you here?" inquired a
well-known voice. It was Colonel Wyborne, who
had been disturbed by the falling of the chair at
my first entrance, and who had descended as he was,
in search of the cause. My confusion may be imagined:
I would almost have exchanged his presence
for that of one of the beings of another world, which
for a moment I had imagined him to be. He stood
looking at me with a kind of bewildered curiosity,
and again said, before I had recovered from my confusion,

<!-- v2 page 94 -->

"Young man, how came you here at this time
of night?"</p>

<p>By this time I had descended from my elevation,
and had in some degree collected my spirits, and,
thinking that the truth was the best excuse I could
make, I apologized for having disturbed his repose,
and accounted for my strange conduct by the strong
curiosity which my aunt Champion's description of
Mrs. Wyborne had excited in my mind to see her
portrait. I added, that, as the picture was veiled, I
had concluded that the subject was one upon which
I was not to touch in his presence; but that my
curiosity was certainly not diminished by that air
of mystery, and it had perhaps got the better of my
sense of what was due to my host; which certainly
should have prevented me from prying into what he
saw fit to conceal. I concluded by heartily begging
his pardon for my unauthorized intrusion upon such
sacred ground, and promising to offend no more in
future.</p>

<p>I had gathered up my candlestick and broken
candle, and was passing by him, feeling sufficiently
foolish, when the kind old man laid his hand upon
my arm, and gently detained me.</p>

<p>"Stop," said he, "there is no great harm in what
you have done: your chief fault has been in not having
told me of your desire to see all that remains to
me of my beloved wife. I did not know that you
had even heard of her; and she is a subject to which
I never lead, unless I am sure of an interested auditor.

<!-- v2 page 95 -->

Ascend the steps again, if you please, and draw
the curtain."</p>

<p>Much relieved, I obeyed with alacrity, and the
portrait was soon unveiled. The light of the two
faint candles gave but a tantalizing view of a form of
the softest grace, and features of the most bewitching
beauty. There she sat in the bloom of early
womanhood&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"In freshest flower of youthly years."</p>

</div>

<p>The side of her figure was presented to you; but her
face was turned as it were suddenly to yours, as if
upon some happy surprise; life and joy breathing
from her half-smiling lips, and flashing from her dark
hazel eyes. The graceful proportions of her bust,
too, were brought skilfully into view by the attitude
the painter had chosen. Her light brown hair, forming
a singular but beautiful contrast with her dark
eyes, fell in natural ringlets upon her shoulders, and
shaded her pure brow. Her right hand rested upon
the smallest of lapdogs, which (evidently a portrait,
too) was apparently roused by the same cause which
had excited his mistress, and was half standing upon
her lap, and regarding you with a serious earnestness
of expression. She was seated under a tree, as was
usual in portraits of women of that day; and a landscape,
which I could scarcely discern, formed the
rest of the scenery of the picture.</p>

<p>I stood for many minutes gazing upon this lovely
vision, this being long since vanished from the earth,

<!-- v2 page 96 -->

and yet here before me in all the rosy light of youth
and joy. Colonel Wyborne did not interrupt my
abstracted gaze till I drew a long breath, as if after
a long draught of beauty. He at length broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"It is like her," said he, "too like her, I sometimes
think; and at other times I look at it till the resemblance
seems to vanish in the stronger light of
memory. It is for this reason that I have hung the
curtain before it; for I find that the reality of the
portraiture impresses me more vividly if it be presented
only occasionally to my view."</p>

<p>"She must have indeed been a creature," I exclaimed,
"to be remembered to the end of the longest
life! I am sure that her image will never fade from
my remembrance, should my days be protracted to
the utmost verge of existence."</p>

<p>"You are right, my son," returned my aged friend:
"you are right. She was one of those beings who
bore the stamp of immortality upon her brow while
she was on earth; and she breathed an undying remembrance
into the hearts of all who knew her. We
have been long parted; but she has never been absent
from me. And now this fleshly veil must soon be
withdrawn, and we shall again see one another face
to face."</p>

<p>As he was speaking, I turned my eyes from the
lively portraiture before me to the living countenance
at my side. His eyes were raised; the tears rolled
down his wrinkled but unmoved cheek; his mind

<!-- v2 page 97 -->

had, as it were, for a moment escaped from its prison-house,
and rejoined the companion-spirit, the long-lost,
but the unforgotten.</p>

<p>"The tears of bearded men," it has been said, and
often quoted, "stir up the soul of him who beholds
them with a far deeper, because stranger sympathy,
than is called forth by the ready tears of woman."
But what are they to the tears of extreme old age?</p>

<p>I was deeply moved, and, descending from my elevation,
I advanced to my venerable friend, and, taking
his hand, reproached myself for having thus agitated
his aged bosom by my ill-timed curiosity. He looked
at me, and seeing in my wet eye and quivering lip
the sympathy which annihilated the years that separated
us, he looked benignantly upon me, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear boy, it is I who should apologize
for having thus given vent to emotions which are far
better confined in the breast. But you have taken
me at unawares, and the strangeness of the hour
and the unexpectedness of this interview quite disarmed
me. But come," he continued, taking me by
the arm, "we will live over together those long-gone
years at some more seasonable time. And now let us
betake ourselves to our chambers again."</p>

<p>With these words we slowly retired from the library,
and ascended the stairs in silence. When we
reached the door of my apartment, Colonel Wyborne
expressively pressed my hand without a word, and
left me&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"To chew the food of sweet and bitter fancy."</p>

</div>

<!-- v2 page 98 -->

<p>It was now near one o'clock. My fire was almost
out, and my candle was flickering in its socket: so I
speedily disposed myself for rest. It was long, however,
before sleep consented to be wooed to my pillow.
The figures of my aged host and of the bride
of his youth for a long time flitted around my couch,
and drove sleep away. At last, however, the twin-brother
of Death waved his poppies over my head,
and my senses were lapped in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>When I awoke in the morning, the midnight events,
which were the first which occurred to my remembrance,
seemed, like the visions of the night, to be
"such stuff as dreams are made of." But the rays of
the sun soon chased away the shadows which had
lingered after sleep had fled, and I realized that I
had actually had the singular interview with Colonel
Wyborne in the library, which dwelt on my memory.
I felt at first as if our morning meeting might be a
little awkward after our midnight parting, and I
resolved to make no allusion to the matter, unless
my host led to the subject; but upon second thoughts
I determined not to treat it as a circumstance of
which I was ashamed, but as one which had excited
a strong interest in my mind, of which I could not
forbear to speak.</p>

<p>Upon my reaching the parlor, I found Peter busily
employed in laying the breakfast-table, with an air
of even greater importance than usual; which I accounted
for by the fact of its being Thanksgiving
Day. His master had not yet appeared. But a few

<!-- v2 page 99 -->

minutes, however, elapsed, before the door opened,
and he came in. He bade me good-morning in his
usual manner, and I could perceive no trace of the
agitation of a few hours before. When Peter had
marshalled the last division of the multitudinous
array of comestibles which were provided for my
refreshment, and the housekeeper had duly furnished
forth the simpler components of Colonel Wyborne's
repast, and they had both withdrawn, I begged to
know if my kind entertainer had experienced any ill
consequences from his unusual exposure, of which I
was the unintentional cause. He set my fears at rest
upon that point, and showing no disinclination to
the subject, I reverted to it, assuring him that it was
an hour the remembrance of which would abide with
me to my dying-day. He seemed pleased with my
enthusiasm, and gratified to think that the memory
of his wife, which he had supposed would have been
buried with himself, would take root in a younger
breast, and flourish for another generation. He inquired
how much of his history I had learned from
Mrs. Champion, and then added many particulars
which she had omitted, from her having figured favorably
in them, of his short residence in Boston.
He also added, beginning at the breakfast-table, and
continuing his narrative in a short walk in the garden,
a succinct history of his first acquaintance with
Maria Somers, the difficulties he surmounted, his
clandestine marriage, and the reasons which made it
expedient to transfer his residence from England to

<!-- v2 page 100 -->

America. His history, strange and eventful as it was,
I must reserve for some opportunity which affords an
ampler verge than is left by this too protracted though
"ower true" tale. We continued sauntering up and
down the gravel walks, and bathing in the delicious
soft air and hazy light of a day better worthy of a
place among the bright ring that circle in joyous dance
around the merry month of May than to be of the
train of the gloomy month which ushers in the winter,
till the sound of the first bell reminded us that it
was time to make our preparations for divine service.</p>

<p>My toilet was soon completed, and I occupied myself
until it was time to go to church in a daylight
visit to the library. The lovely features of Maria
Wyborne were still unveiled, and smiled upon me
even more sweetly than they had done the night before,
as the rays of the sun seemed to penetrate the
darkest recesses of the picture, and to bring boldly
out all that was dimly seen at midnight. When I
heard Colonel Wyborne leave his chamber overhead,
I drew the curtain, and, having removed the steps
from the fireplace to their appropriate nook, I issued
out to meet him.</p>

<p>The second bell was just beginning to ring, and the
carriage was already at the door; the sable coach
man sitting complacently enthroned upon the dicky,
while Peter, hat in hand, stood by the expanded
door and unfolded steps of the old-fashioned chariot.
Colonel Wyborne stood before me as he reached the
lowest stair, the very image of a gentleman of the

<!-- v2 page 101 -->

generation which was then just leaving the stage.
His wig was elaborately powdered, and terminated
behind in a black silk bag, which swung pendulously
from shoulder to shoulder as he walked. His coat
was of a deep claret-color, with gold buttons, and
embroidered about the button-holes, skirts, and cuffs.
His waistcoat, of the same material, richly laced about
the ample pocket-flaps, opening in front, displayed a
world of the finest lace waving in the breeze. Ruffles
of the same gossamer fabric shaded his hands. His
breeches and stockings were of black silk, and his
shoes were graced with ample buckles of the purest
gold. His gold-headed cane&mdash;full half as tall as
himself, now only seen on the stage&mdash;and his cocked
hat were brought by the vigilant Peter, who left
his post by the carriage-door upon his master's approach.
Having invested him with these ensigns of
dignity, Peter took the cloak from the hands of the
attendant housekeeper, and with fitting reverence enveloped
his master's form in its ample folds. Alas for
the scarlet cloaks of our fathers! They have vanished,
with many of the other habits of our ancestors,
and have carried with them to their last home much
of the graceful reverence for age and rank of which
they were the emblems. Peace to their shreds!</p>

<p>Colonel Wyborne, being at length invested with all
his habiliments, leaned upon my arm, and somewhat
painfully ascended the uncertain footing of the carriage-steps.
I followed him, and the door was closed
upon us by Peter, who duly took his stand behind the

<!-- v2 page 102 -->

carriage. The heavy vehicle moved slowly forward,
and, as we turned into the high-road, it might have
been thought that one of the frontispieces to the old
editions of Sir Charles Grandison was suddenly inspired
with life, and had turned out the family coach
of Uncle Selby, or the more elegant equipage of Sir
Hargrave Pollexfen, or the mercurial Lady G., upon
the king's highway. Turning to the left as we came
into the public road, we ascended a considerable hill,
from the top of which we saw before us the village
meeting-house, forming, as it were, the centre of the
little rural system. As we drove along the road we
saw the inhabitants of the village issuing from their
comfortable houses, and wending their way to church.
They were mostly dressed in the productions of their
own farms and looms, and had an air of substantial
plenty about them, without any attempts on the part
of man or woman to ape the manners and costume of
the town. The road was also covered with the farmers
who lived beyond walking-distance, mounted on
stout farm-horses, with their wives or daughters seated
on pillions behind them; and now and then a heavy
square-topped gig, or chaise as it was then called,
looking like a sedan-chair cut in two and placed on
wheels, came lumbering along, filled with an amount
of humanity which proved to a demonstration the
infinite compressibility, if not perfectibility, of human
nature. The meeting-house was of the earliest style
of construction; the belfry in the centre of the roof,
which sloped up on four sides to it: the principal

<!-- v2 page 103 -->

door, which was opposite to the pulpit, was on one of
the longer sides of the parallelogram, while the shorter
sides were adorned and accommodated with porticos.
As we passed by the cheerful groups of walkers or
riders,&mdash;for, it not being the sabbath, they did not
think it incumbent upon them, though going to meeting,
to put on their Sunday faces,&mdash;they all made due
reverence to Colonel Wyborne, who was universally
beloved for his bountiful and courteous spirit. When
we drew up at the church-door, many a brawny arm
was proffered to assist him in his descent, which he
acknowledged with the most perfect grace of good-breeding,
and said something to each of his humble
friends, which made them better contented with
themselves, and of course with him.</p>

<p>I followed Colonel Wyborne up the broad aisle to
his pew, which was the fourth from the door on your
right hand and the nearest of the pews to the pulpit,
the space between the pews and the pulpit being filled
up with benches, upon which were arranged the aged
parishioners who were not owners of pews, in order
of seniority; the post of honor being the one nearest
the minister. The pulpit was of oak, unpainted, and
surmounted by an enormous sounding-board, looking
like a gigantic extinguisher just on the point of putting
out the luminary beneath. Beneath the pulpit,
the deacons' seat embraced within its ample enclosure
the dignified officials for whom it was designed,&mdash;one
bald-headed, with an unquestionable squint, and
the other with his thin gray locks falling almost to

<!-- v2 page 104 -->

his shoulders, and with a sharp face and meagre person;
both seated with their backs to the pulpit, and
their faces to the congregation. Two galleries ran
round the walls; one filled with women, and the other
with men. Near the ceiling, on the left hand as we
sat, a phenomenon was presented to the inquiring eye
in the shape of an oblong hole in the wall, surrounded
by a sort of wooden frame in which was set a human
face, which glared upon the meeting-house door with
an earnestness almost supernatural. About every
ten seconds the face of the apparition underwent a
sort of downward twitch, which was succeeded with a
sharp toll of the bell; but the eyes were ever riveted
upon the door. At length a twitch of more convulsive
energy than usual was followed by an emphatic
clang of the bell, which said as plainly as the tongue
of bell could speak, "There, my work's done for to-day!"
And, while its undulating sound was vibrating
on the ear, the Rev. Mr. Armsby walked majestically
along the aisle, and ascended the stairs; his well-powdered
wig diffusing a miniature snow-storm upon
the small precise cape of his black cloak. After a
short pause, the services proceeded. The prayers of
the revered pastor were admirable, eloquent, devout,
fervid, mostly clothed in the language of Scripture, or
at least in language which gushed from a mind deeply
imbued with the spirit of the Hebrew prophets. As
the rich, deep tones of his voice uttered forth the recital
of the blessings and bounties which this people
had received at the hand of Heaven,&mdash;of freedom, of

<!-- v2 page 105 -->

peace, of plenty, and, above all, of the knowledge of
the true God and of Jesus Christ whom he has sent,&mdash;and
then described their unworthiness and ingratitude
and sinfulness, and deprecated the impending
wrath of Heaven and the awful judgments which
were reserved for an ungrateful, godless nation, all
wrapt in the dark and terrible imagery of the prophecies,
I could almost imagine that I heard one of the
seers of old telling in thunder-tones his message of
warning and denunciation to the chosen but erring
race.</p>

<p>The innovation of a choir had displaced the good
old custom of singing the hymns "line by line" by
the whole congregation. Of this part of the service I
will say nothing, except that it bore no resemblance
which could shock the most rigid Puritan, to the
choral symphonies of the Sistine Chapel, or even to
the heathenish melody of that legitimate daughter of
the old Scarlet Lady, the Church of England. A bass-viol
grated its share of harsh discords in addition to
those of the human instruments, all of which together,
if the science of music does not lie, must have
amounted to harmony. Colonel Wyborne, in the
goodness of his heart and the abundance of his good
will to any persons who earnestly did what they could
to assist at the service of the sanctuary, though himself
an excellent judge of music, stood up alone during
the performance, and encouraged the choristers by
strict attention, and beating time, and, when they
finished, by an emphatic, "Very well, very well indeed!"

<!-- v2 page 106 -->

audible over the whole house. My gravity,
I confess, received a severe shock, and I fully expected
to hear a general titter run round the assembly; but
a hurried glance around satisfied me that it was a
usual act of my admirable old friend, and was regarded
with pride and pleasure by the singers and
the rest of the congregation, and by no means looked
upon as anything out of the common way. This circumstance
brought Sir Roger de Coverley at once to
my mind; and, the idea being suggested, I recalled
a good many points of resemblance between the warm
hearted old baronet and Colonel Wyborne; though
the latter was entirely free from any hallucination
like that which sometimes sent Sir Roger's wits a
wool-gathering.</p>

<p>The introductory services being over, the minister
rose and took a prefatory look around at his flock.
Before giving out his text, however, he desired the
audience, in a tone of authority and decision which
would have well become Dr. Johnson himself when
he scolded Boswell for having a headache, not to
interrupt the discourse by coughing or sneezing;
which ebullitions he assured them were entirely unnecessary.
It may be well to add that his commands
were strictly obeyed; thus affording a new fact in
support of Kant's theory of the power of the will over
bodily ailments. This preliminary being adjusted, he
announced his text, and proceeded with his sermon.
It was a truly masterly production, and displayed
those remarkable powers which not long afterwards

<!-- v2 page 107 -->

procured his translation to the more congenial atmosphere
of the metropolis. It was a work like one of
the Pyramids; its foundations, broad and deep, resting
on eternal and universal truth, and the superstructure
tapering in sublime simplicity up to the blessed
duty of gratitude,&mdash;massive blocks of sense and reasoning
piled regularly in lessening rows upon one an
other, and clamped together by cogent quotations from
the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures; all ascending upwards
to a single truth, and making upon the mind,
undistracted by meretricious ornament, an impression
of oneness, the feeling of a grand whole. The music of
his intonations and the harmony of his gesture are still
present to my mind, as if it were but yesterday that he
spoke. He was listened to with the most profound
attention; and, when he ended, his auditory all seemed
to take a long breath, and each man looked upon his
neighbor with a flushed cheek and a dilated eye.</p>

<p>But one circumstance interrupted the solemnity of
the discourse, and that was too characteristic a one to
be passed over in silence. In the midst of the sermon
an unlucky child in the women's gallery began to
cry. The pastor stopped short, turned his severe eye
upon the dismayed mother, and sternly said, "Take
that child away!" In unutterable confusion the poor
woman gathered up her descendant; and the urchin,
kicking and screaming with an energy worthy of a
better cause, quickly vanished from our sight. This
little episode, however, attracted but little attention
on the part of the rest of the audience, and, the moment

<!-- v2 page 108 -->

it was over, they were as deeply absorbed as
ever in the march of the discourse.</p>

<p>After the blessing had been pronounced, the whole
congregation remained standing in their places, as was
their invariable custom, until Mr. Armsby and Colonel
Wyborne had left the house. While the clergyman
was making his preparations for his departure,
Colonel Wyborne left his pew, and kindly advanced
to the venerable band of old men, and made friendly
inquiries as to their well-being; and I could catch
the sounds of their grateful voices thanking him for
the bountiful gifts which he had bestowed upon them
at this joyful season. When Mr. Armsby descended
from the pulpit, Colonel Wyborne took his arm, and,
giving me a signal to follow, slowly left the house,
courteously inclining his head to the right and left
in acknowledgment of the respectful salutations
which he received from the sturdy farmers on either
side. We all three entered the coach, which we found
ready at the door, and were soon conveyed to the
scene of the solemnities which yet remained to be
performed appropriate to the great New England festival.
On the way, the conversation was engrossed
by the two gentlemen, and I confess that I regarded
my reverend companion as a sort of a Mordecai at
my gate, and looked forward with a kind of dismay
to the cloud which he would bring over the joyous
festivity which I had anticipated at the Thanksgiving
table of my genial host.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival we were shown into the library,

<!-- v2 page 109 -->

at either end of which a blazing fire worthy of an English
Christmas diffused a generous warmth through
the apartment. The cheerful heat had an evident
effect on the ice of the reverend gentleman's manners;
for, there being no provision made in those
days for warming churches, we were all glad enough
to greet the cordial welcome of the blaze. As we
walked from one fireplace to the other, and stopped
before each to imbibe a portion of its warmth, Mr.
Armsby, for almost the first time, turned to me and
said, "Well, young gentleman, how do you like being
between two fires?"&mdash;a jocular abortion which I
received with a laugh worthy of a better jest, with
an explosion which would not have discredited a
Sch&oelig;pen in the eyes of a jovial burgomaster. The
worthy gentleman evidently took my laugh in good
part, and by being put on better terms with himself,
was disposed to regard me with more consideration
than he had yet done. He made some more rather
cumbrous attempts at jocularity, which being met
more than halfway by myself, we soon rapidly neared
one another, and before long, not unassisted by the
good-nature of our host, we were fairly engaged yard-arm
to yard-arm. My awe of him gradually melted
away, and, before Peter made his appearance with the
tankard of punch, I began to wonder that I could ever
have felt any.</p>

<p>As I have hinted in the preceding sentence, in due
time the door opened, and the excellent functionary
there alluded to was ushered in, bearing with fitting

<!-- v2 page 110 -->

solemnity upon a salver the silver tankard, which in
those days ever heralded the serious business of the
day. A grateful perfume arose from its brimming
mouth, and filled the apartment. Colonel Wyborne
received the fragrant offering at the hands of the
sable Ganymede, and, having raised it to his lips,
passed it to his most honored guest, who paid it the
homage of a deeper libation, and then consigned it to
my ingenuous hands. This harbinger of better things
to come (now, I admit, better far removed) performed
its orbit round our little circle with a rapidity and
regularity which would have given a temperance
society a fit of delirium-tremens, until the last drop
was drained. Admirer as I am of old customs, I must
allow that this was one which I am glad to have survived.
The punch-drinking of a morning, which our
ancestors looked upon in the light of an innocent
amusement, not to say of a positive duty, is extinct,
and with it have vanished in a great measure the gout,
and a train of "immedicable ills" of which it was the
fruitful parent. Since its disappearance, too, drunkenness
is a vice almost unknown to the educated
classes; which was far from being the case in my
time. On the present occasion, however, the bewitching
draught seemed to unlock the secret source of a
thousand sympathies till then unsuspected, and to
bring to light a multitude of affinities, unfelt before,
between the morning, the meridian, and the evening
of life. Under its deceitful though delicious
enchantment, the barriers which time and custom

<!-- v2 page 111 -->

had raised between us, and which but a short time
before seemed to be impassable, were levelled with
the ground, and we stood side by side as friend by
friend.</p>

<p>Precisely as the hall-clock struck two, Peter, reentering,
announced dinner, and, marshalled by that
dark seneschal, we proceeded in due order to the
dining-room. Mr. Armsby blessed the meal with a
grace which seemed at least sufficiently long to a hungry
boy, in which he did not omit, in the enumeration
of blessings, the Governor, Council, the churches,
the college, and the old Congress. When he had
concluded, and we had taken our seats, the covers
were removed, and displayed an array of dishes which
would have seemed preposterous for the supply of
three persons, did we not know that a multitude of
retainers were assembled in the kitchen, eagerly
awaiting whatever might fall from our table. A noble
tautaug,<sup>1</sup> with his tail in his mouth, lay grimly before
me, like the Egyptian emblem of eternity. At the
foot of the table, Colonel Wyborne was intrenched
behind a formidable round of beef <i>&agrave;-la-mode</i>. A
roast turkey was stretched, victim-like, upon his back
before the sacerdotal knife of the pastor; while on
the other side of the table a pair of boiled chickens
lay patiently awaiting their immersion in the oyster-sauce
which stood ready for the deed. Vegetables of
every description filled up all the interstices of the
well-spread board; and decanters of white wine (for

<!-- v2 page 112 -->

as yet red wine was not) kept watch and ward, like
tall sentinels, over the whole scene of action. Soon
the remains of the fish before me were decently removed,
and replaced by an admirable haunch of venison,
attended by all that should accompany that prince
of meats,&mdash;the sacrificial fires; the jelly, "sweet as
the smile when fond lovers meet, and soft as their
parting tear;" the thin parallelograms of toast, brown
as the Arabian berry. All our energies were soon
wholly engrossed in this new career of duty, which
we pursued with an untiring zeal and indomitable
perseverance, which should have entitled us to a high
place among the benefactors of mankind.</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>Vulgarly called black-fish by the many.]</p>

<p>But, alas! even venison may cease to please. At
least a foreboding of future good yet to be revealed
from the dark recesses of the kitchen prompted forbearance
ere it was too late. At length the viands
which I have feebly attempted to describe were transported
from our eyes, and a new generation occupied
their vacant places. The beef <i>&agrave;-la-mode</i> suddenly
gave place to the much-injured bird which saved the
capitol; the venison, with a sigh, yielded its throne
to a triple alliance of wild ducks; a pair of partridges
dislodged the reluctant turkey; while the boiled
chickens with the attendant oyster-sauce fled amain
before the incursion of a horde of lesser "fowl of
game." The transitory nature of all human things
is well illustrated by the sentiment of one of the heroines
of "The Rovers, or the Double Arrangement,"
in the Anti-Jacobin, where she says (I quote from

<!-- v2 page 113 -->

memory), "The beef of to-morrow will succeed to the
veal of to-day, as the veal of to-day has succeeded to
the mutton of yesterday." But the flying courses of
a single repast bring home even more forcibly to the
reflecting mind the instability of our most substantial
joys, and afford a lively picture of the fleeting
generations of mankind, hurrying, like them, over the
bountifully spread and richly adorned banqueting-table
on which Boon Nature feasts her children.
The change which had just come over the scene before
us was not destined to endure any more than the one
which had preceded it. The shining face of Peter is
again seen, full of busy importance, bustling about the
board. And now the table is cleared; and anxious
expectation sits impatient on every brow. A pause
ensues. The door opens, and, lo! he comes, the Pudding
of the Plum, Thanksgiving Day's acknowledged
chief. He comes, attended, conqueror-like, by the
dethroned monarch of Christmas Day, Mince-pie, who
follows, crestfallen, in his triumphal train. Apple-pie,
too, rears his "honest soncy face" in sturdy yeoman
pride. Custard, no longer "blasphemed through
the nose," receives the respectful deference due to
fallen greatness. And thou, Pumpkin-pie, my country's
boast, when I forget thee, may my right hand
forget its cunning! And Squash-pie, too, when I
refuse to celebrate thy praise, may my tongue cleave
to the roof of my mouth!</p>

<p>Then came the dessert, chiefly composed, from the
necessity of the season, of dried fruits; but then such

<!-- v2 page 114 -->

apples and such pears!&mdash;apples for which Atalanta
might well have lost her race, or which might well
have been thrown by Discord among the gods. The
pears, too!&mdash;St. Michael's spicy fruit, St. Catherine's
immutable glow,&mdash;"the side that's next the sun,"&mdash;worthy
the cheek of a cherub; St. Germain's celestial
gust; and other gentle races which confer by
their virtues higher honors on their patron saints
than any they derive from their canonization.</p>

<p>Then, too, came from the subterraneous crypts,
where they had been confined for many years, the imprisoned
spirits whom Wit obeys; not those fierce
demons which are called into being amidst the
fierce combustion of the still, and which soon tear
in pieces the victims whom they have singled out
for their prey, but "delicate spirits," like the gentle
Ariel, bursting into life in the year-long summer's
day of the Fortunate Islands, and summoned across
the Atlantic waves to impart their native summer
to Northern hearts. Alas that any magicians should
now be found who would fain exorcise them, and
condemn them to the fate of vulgar devils! But
then it must be admitted that the degeneracy of
modern times has reached even these ethereal powers.
The grapes of the present day do not express the same
juice which gushed from the veins of their progenitors.
Their thin potations have debauched this
washy generation. Did the French philosophy take
root amongst us before our clay had been soaked in
claret and champagne? Were we overrun with the

<!-- v2 page 115 -->

weeds of German metaphysics before the Rhine had
poured an acid deluge over the land? Talk of the
schoolmaster being abroad! The heresies which infest
this age were unknown until the wine-merchant
went abroad.</p>

<p>I wish that I could find it in my heart to detain
the gentle reader from the perusal of things better
worth his reading, and recount the talk of that genial
day. But the milkiness of my nature forbids. Besides,
a separate essay will not be too much to devote
to the oddities, genius, and virtues of Richard Armsby.
He was a choice specimen of that racy class of
originals, the elder New England clergy; men who
were in a great measure raised above the control of
public opinion, and the sharpnesses of whose characters
were not smoothed down by the friction of society,
and the excursions of whose eccentricities were
checked neither by the inquisition of squeamish coteries
nor by the censure of a fastidious age. I have
never looked upon his like since he entered into his
rest. He united the playfulness of Yorick and the
simplicity of Parson Adams with the logical acuteness
of Butler, the strong sense of Barrow, and the
redundant imagination of Taylor; and all these shining
and solid materials which went to make up the
web of his remarkable mind were strongly relieved
by the dark groundwork of the sternest Calvinism
upon which they were woven. And yet this man
is forgotten. His sermons, which should have constituted
an integral portion of our literature, have

<!-- v2 page 116 -->

been fated to "clothe spice, line trunks," or to fall
into the sacrilegious hands of the "oblivious cook."
Surely this was a man of whom the world in which
he lived was not worthy.</p>

<p>That day is an epoch in my life, for it was the first
time that I had ever listened to the table-talk of the
highest description. I might have searched the world
through, and yet not have met with two such men,
so different and yet so admirable, as the two whom,
the chances of life had thrown together in the remote
village of Sanfield. I have since listened to most of
the celebrated men of conversation of our times, and
the chimes of midnight have often fallen unheeded
upon my ear as I yielded myself to the enchantment
of their eloquence and wit; but the remembrance of
that brilliant day still holds the first place among my
convivial memories.</p>

<p>We remained at table till about six o'clock, when
we returned to the library, where tea and coffee were
served. After this ceremony was over, Mr. Armsby's
pipe was brought,&mdash;"his custom always of an afternoon,"&mdash;and
taking, as it were, a new departure from
this event, he swept gallantly on through a sea of
talk, growing more and more brilliant as he went.
At last, however, ten o'clock came. He knocked out
the last ashes of his pipe, and, taking a glass more of
wine as a stirrup-cup, he prepared for his departure.
The carriage was soon at the door; and our charming
friend, for such I could not but regard him in spite
of his ministerial dignity, bade us a cordial good-night.

<!-- v2 page 117 -->

As I attended him to the carriage, he warmly
pressed me, nothing loath, to visit him at his bachelor's
house.</p>

<p>When I returned to the library, Colonel Wyborne
begged to know whether I did not think that his
prophecy the day before, of the change which a day
would bring forth in Mr. Armsby, had not been fulfilled.
I replied with expressions of the warmest
admiration of the qualities of his reverend friend.
"And pray, sir," I added, "why did not you tell me
how extraordinary a man he is?"</p>

<p>"Simply," he replied with a benignant smile, "simply
because I wished to give you the pleasure of
finding it out for yourself."</p>

<p>We soon separated for the night; but it was long
after I had sought my couch that the clear tones of
the pastor's voice died upon my ear. The strange
groups of thought, in which ideas that never before
dreamt of meeting each other found themselves side
by side; the freshness and beauty of his classic allusions,
and the grotesque narrations of scenes and
characters such as are only known in a simple and
primitive state of society, delivered with a spirit and
life which Matthews never surpassed, all together
produced a degree of pleasurable excitement which
drove sleep far from my eyes. The walls of my
solitary chamber rung with the echoes of a foregone
merriment; and, if my pillow were that night wet
with tears, they were the tears</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Of one worn out with mirth and laughter."</p>

</div>

<!-- v2 page 118 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next morning, after breakfast, Colonel Wyborne
proposed to me a drive to the parsonage
to pay a visit to Mr. Armsby. I gladly closed with
this proposition, as my experiences of the day before
had excited a strong curiosity on my part to know
more of that true original&mdash;in the best sense of the
word. The coach having been ordered, my excellent
host, at my request, commenced a short account of
his reverend friend, which he concluded as we drove
towards his local habitation. His history was not
very different from that of hosts of other ornaments
of the New England Church and State. His father
was a painstaking farmer, who extracted by the
alchemy of intelligent labor, from the rocky and ungenial
soil of one of the least propitious portions of
Massachusetts Bay, a plentiful and comfortable subsistence
for a family of some twelve children. The
early education of his son Richard had been in the
school of agricultural labor. The plough and the
spade were the earliest teachers his rugged intellect
had known. During the leisure hours of "workless
winter," indeed, he had picked up the rudiments of
knowledge, and secured those branches of learning,
which, according to high authority, "come by nature."

<!-- v2 page 119 -->

Having acquired the key to knowledge, he soon employed
it to unlock all the stores which were within
his reach. His father's literary collections were not
of a very extensive or a very various description. A
few books of Puritan divinity, and many printed sermons
of New England divines, in loose pamphlets,
formed the staple of his library. These works, however,
for want of matter more attractive, were eagerly
devoured. Among his father's books, however, was
Cotton Mather's "Magnalia," which soon became his
favorite author. His admiration was excited by the
display of learning which so liberally garnishes those
curious pages; and his wonder was none the less
because he could not detect the pedantry and bad
taste of the load of quotations with which the author's
original matter is overlaid, and of the conceits
in which he delights to indulge. To a boy in an inland
town, brought up in Puritan habits, this book
was truly fascinating. The histories of the worthies
who had founded or embellished the infant empire;
the descriptions of the persecutions which they endured
in England, and of the hardships which they
encountered when they snatched their civil and religious
rights to these bleak and inhospitable shores;
the stirring descriptions of the Indian wars, which so
often threatened destruction to the whole province,
and of which there were many survivors in his
neighborhood, full of traditionary lore; and especially
the solemn recital of the mysterious phenomena of
witchcraft, of the wiles of Satan for the extirpation

<!-- v2 page 120 -->

of God's people, some of which, it must be confessed,
did but little credit to the sagacity of the arch-enemy&mdash;all
these topics formed fertile themes for winter
evening study and for summer noontide dreams.</p>

<p>I do not wonder that the belief in witchcraft took
such strong hold of our ancestors' imaginations, living
as they did in a country but half explored, overshadowed
with primeval forests&mdash;filled with heathen foes
and with savage beasts&mdash;from the depths of which
strange sounds came at midnight upon their ear, and
whose varying shadows and lights assumed to the
superstitious eye of the wayfarer the grotesque or
ghastly forms of demons or spectres. There was an
infinite deal more romance in the primitive days of
our ancestors, planted as they were on a narrow
belt between the ocean and the wilderness, than we
can dream of in these prosaic days of steam and
railroads.</p>

<p>Richard Armsby's love of books early aroused in
his father's breast the ambition, which in those days
lingered in every parent's heart, of seeing his son one
of the clergy, one of the religious aristocracy of the
land. His narrow circumstances, however, made
the prospect almost a hopeless one, until one day the
pastor of the parish, in one of his parochial rounds,
discovered the young enthusiast busily employed
with his favorite volume. It so happened that "the
fantastic old great man" was a favorite with the good
man; and his heart warmed towards the lad when
he found how thoroughly he was acquainted with all

<!-- v2 page 121 -->

that he could learn from that not too authentic source
of the history of his country. His father's wishes
and his own tastes were soon made known to their
several advisers, and he undertook the task of preparing
the young man for college. This was speedily
accomplished by the vigorous intellect, and earnestness
of purpose, of young Armsby. The work of
preparation being finished, he was despatched to
Cambridge, with but a small stock of money, but
with an ample supply of faith and hope. His struggles
in the cause of good learning were severe, and
his heart at times almost died within him, and he
was more than once on the point of abandoning his
studies. In a happy hour, however, he went, one
winter's vacation, to keep the village school of Sanfield,
where he soon attracted the kind notice of
Colonel Wyborne. The sagacity and knowledge of
character which were almost instinctive with that
excellent gentleman, soon discerned that the rough
diamond he had lighted upon was a gem of the first
water. From that moment, all his difficulties were
at an end. His kind patron's liberality removed all
obstacles from his way, and made the remainder of
his literary path one of pleasantness. Soon after his
college career was finished, the minister of Sanfield
died; and Mr. Armsby was very soon inducted into
his place, chiefly through Colonel Wyborne's influence.
For the many years that had elapsed since
that day, they had lived on terms of the most cordial
intimacy; their esteem for each other increasing

<!-- v2 page 122 -->

with their years. Mr. Armsby having never been
married, their friendly intercourse had never encountered
the interruption which the intervention of
Hymen but too often works in the best-grounded
friendships; and I doubt not that the minister's
congenial society greatly contributed to cheer and
prolong his aged friend's existence.</p>

<p>The substance of this narrative was just imparted
as the carriage drove up to the parsonage-door. It
was a very old building, unpainted, situated just on
the edge of the village. It stood on a high bank, at
some distance from the road, with two or three trees
of aboriginal growth waving their twisted arms above
its roof. The master of the house received us at the
door with much formal politeness. On entering the
front-door, we descended one step, which had nearly
been a step too much for me, having never before
been greeted with such a reception at any threshold
I had ever passed. In front of us was a wooden seat,
which opened on hinges, and displayed a sort of chest.
The stairs ascended abruptly, almost from the very
door. Turning to our left, we were ushered into the
study, which was almost the only apartment which
the solitary minister used of his whole house. It
was a room of good size, but with a low ceiling, and
a bare beam, rough-shaped with the axe, passing
through its length. The walls were well covered
with dingy-looking books, most of them formidable
folios of controversial divinity, but relieved by
excellent editions of the Greek and Latin classics

<!-- v2 page 123 -->

(for Mr. Armsby was a ripe scholar and a good one),
and by some of the sterling English authors. There
was the folio edition of Shakspeare, and the little
shabby quarto first edition of "Paradise Lost," in ten
books, and there was the first edition of Burton's
"Anatomy," which I had ever seen. A wooden arm
chair with a leaf to it was the throne of the sovereign
of the domain. A few wooden chairs&mdash;of
various shapes, and apparently of different epochs in
the colonial history, but none of which would have
excited the envy of a Sybarite&mdash;were scattered about
the room in a somewhat dusty confusion. A deal
table or so, and a woodbox, completed the furniture
of the apartment. The floor was unconscious of a
carpet, and to all appearance had been long innocent
of the knowledge of the virtues of soap and fair
water. The hearth was of red brick, on which was
built a wood fire of exemplary brightness. The
bricks of the chimney-back, to be sure, had yielded
to the hand of time ("What will not Time subdue!")
but then one of them afforded a timely aid to one of
the andirons, which, in the course of many years'
service, had lost a leg. The neatness of the whole
establishment did not certainly afford much room for
commendation; but then, as no commendations were
expected or desired, it was of the less consequence.</p>

<p>Our reverend host having resigned his chair of
state to his honored guest, and provided himself and
me with humbler stools, we all drew up cheerfully
to the fire, and talked merrily over the day before.

<!-- v2 page 124 -->

Though the manner of Mr. Armsby towards me was
not distinguished by the convivial freedom of the day
before, still it was entirely free from the austerity
and coldness which marked it at our first acquaintance.
It was now just what the demeanor of a gentleman
of his time of life, and standing in society,
should be towards a lad of eighteen, kind, affable,
without being familiar or free; which made me feel
perfectly at my ease in his company, and yet which
made it perfectly impossible for me to forget the
distance which separated us.</p>

<p>After we had discussed a variety of topics, which
he treated in a manner to show that wine and wassail
had nothing to do with his powers of entertainment,
he inquired about my plans for returning to
Cambridge. I informed him that I must set forth
early the next morning in order to reach the arms of
my Alma Mater before night. As, in the course of
the conversation which ensued on the subject, I
expressed no great satisfaction in the prospect before
me, of a twenty-miles' ride upon a sorry hack,
Colonel Wyborne seemed to be suddenly struck with
a new idea, which he uttered to this effect: "It never
occurred to me before; but I think that I can save
you that tedious ride, if you have no objection to an
expedition in a row-boat."</p>

<p>I assured him that boating was one of my choicest
amusements, and awaited with some curiosity to
know the nature of his proposition.</p>

<p>"If that be the case," said he, "I think, that, as

<!-- v2 page 125 -->

the weather is so fine, we can manage it in this way.
I will take my boat, and accompany you to my farm
on Vincents Island this afternoon, where we will
spend the night; and to-morrow you shall continue
your row up to Boston, while I await the return of
my boat."</p>

<p>"But my horse?"</p>

<p>"Oh, John can take him home on Monday, on his
way to town: it will be but a few miles out of his
way."</p>

<p>The only difficulty in the way being thus obviated,
I most heartily concurred in the plan, which promised
to substitute a cheerful ride over the waves for
a dreary one over the high-road, and, besides, to give
me nearly a whole day to myself in Boston. These
preliminaries being adjusted, Mr. Armsby was invited
to make one of our water-party, with which proposition
he readily closed, to our general satisfaction.</p>

<p>The conversation turning upon the early colonial
times, Mr. Armsby displayed in that most curious
portion of history a minuteness of erudition which
I had never before seen exhibited. It was evidently
his hobby, and he caracoled and curvetted upon it
in a manner which excited my wonder and delight.
He displayed many curious manuscripts of the fathers,
illustrative of their history, and several of the old
Indian deeds and treaties. In his library, too, were
many books which the Pilgrims had made the chosen
companions of their wanderings and exile, rendered
more precious by copious marginal notes, which it

<!-- v2 page 126 -->

would have puzzled the younger Champollion himself
to decipher. In a walk which we took together
round his house, he pointed out the scene of a bloody
fight with the Indians, and showed many perforations
in the walls of his house, made by the bullets of the
savage foe. Then there was the pear-tree which
Elder Brewster planted with his own hands, and the
very oak under which Captain Miles Standish and
his little company bivouacked on the night of their
return from the discomfiture of Morton and his
rabble rout at Merry Mount. The interest which
I took in these relics of the last age, and the attention
which I gave to his commentaries upon them,
evidently raised me many degrees in his estimation,
and laid the foundation of a friendship which only
ended with his life.</p>

<p>After a visit of nearly two hours, we took our
leave, having first arranged that Mr. Armsby should
join me at dinner, so as to be ready for our excursion.
We then returned home, and were duly joined at an
early hour by our reverend friend. The airy prologue
of the punch, the grave drama of the dinner, and
the cheerful epilogue of the madeira, being over, it
was announced that the tide served, and the boat was
in readiness. We accordingly proceeded on foot to
the shore, John and Peter following us with our
cloaks and luggage. We took a little different route
from the one which Colonel Wyborne and I had followed
on the first day of our visit, and bent our steps
towards the mouth of the little stream which washed

<!-- v2 page 127 -->

his estate, on the banks of which the boat-house was
built. On arriving at the place of embarkation, we
found the boat launched, and the four boatmen&mdash;two
black and two white&mdash;resting on their oars, awaiting
our arrival. Our places were soon taken: Peter, with
our luggage and a stupendous hamper of provisions
and wine for the voyage, was seated in a grinning
delight; and the "trim-built wherry" was speedily
dancing over the crests of the wave.</p>

<p>The afternoon was more like one in May than one
on the very brink of winter. The sun shone brightly;
the sea was placid as a land-locked bay or inland
lake; the sea-fowl hovered above or about us, or
dived beneath the billows; while in the distance the
white sails glided like happy spirits among the islands
of the blessed. The scene was one full of quiet and
of tranquillizing beauty, which rather provoked revery
than conversation. A favorable breeze soon springing
up, the mast was fixed in its place; and the sail, given
to the gale, soon made us leap forward on our course
with a new alacrity. Our voyage was pursued in
silence, only broken by occasional exclamations at
the beautiful effects of light and shade caused by the
floating clouds, and at the varying hues of the distant
ocean. The sun set before we had reached our
port, and, wrapping ourselves in our cloaks, we sat
watching the stars emerging from their ocean-bed,
and beginning the solemn procession which nightly
moves in sublime order around "this dim spot called
earth."</p>

<!-- v2 page 128 -->

<p>Colonel Wyborne seemed to be buried in deepest
revery, sad yet not melancholy, as if the magic of
the scene had conjured up to his half-dreaming eye&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"The spectres which no exorcism can bind,<br/>

The cold, the changed, perchance the dead, to view<br/>

The mourned, the loved, the lost&mdash;too many, yet how few!</p>

<p>We respected the meditative mood of our venerable
friend, and sat in silence till the boat reached her
destined haven; when the oarsmen unshipped the
mast, and pulled stoutly for the little mole which
was projected into the sea.</p>

<p>We were soon disembarked, and on our way to the
farmhouse of Colonel Wyborne, which was occupied
by an excellent man and his wife, now just beginning
to feel the hand of time, who had lived in the sea-girdled
home for the chief of their days. They
received us with many demonstrations of kindness
and respect, and seemed in nowise disconcerted by
our unexpected arrival. Indeed, the ample supplies
of provisions which our commissary Peter brought
along with him removed all hospitable apprehensions
as to our due alimentation. We were received in the
ample kitchen of the farmhouse, which was illuminated
by a blazing pile of logs, roaring up a volcano
of a chimney, and diffusing a ruddy light and cheerful
warmth throughout the apartment. We were
soon comfortably established by the genial fireside,
while the goodwife was busily employed in preparing
our evening meal. When our repast was ready,

<!-- v2 page 129 -->

and we had taken our places at the table, Colonel
Wyborne still seemed absorbed in his dreaming mood,
and was evidently in spirit far away from the wave-washed
islet where he was present in the body. His
silence imposed an unavoidable restraint upon Mr.
Armsby and myself. At last, however, he seemed to
rouse from his revery, and, looking up at us, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know that you will think dotage has come
rapidly upon me, when I tell you of the resolution
which I have been forming. But my mind is made
up: I go to Boston to-night."</p>

<p>"To Boston to-night!" exclaimed in one breath
both his companions; both, no doubt, a little suspicious
that something was out of joint in the good
old gentleman's intellectuals.</p>

<p>"Even so," replied he in his blandest but most
determined manner. "It is now fifty years since I
saw my native city, and I once thought that nothing
could induce me to visit it again; but a strange impulse,
which I have often felt before, urges me with
an almost irresistible force to see once more, before I
die, the scene of my early days and of the short
lived happiness of my prime of manhood."</p>

<p>"But why to-night?" inquired Mr. Armsby.</p>

<p>"Because," he replied, "it may be my last night.
This strange possession often comes over me, sometimes
in my solitary walks, or lonely musings in my
library, but most frequently in those wakeful hours
of nights which form a heavy share of the burden of
old age. I feel that to-night the craving may be

<!-- v2 page 130 -->

satisfied, and that, if I neglect to use this night,
another opportunity may never come to me."</p>

<p>"But I do not exactly comprehend your plan, my
dear sir," observed his reverend companion.</p>

<p>"It is this," he replied. "The moon will rise in
an hour: in three hours we may reach the town.
I propose to land after all the inhabitants have deserted
the streets, and to revisit my old familiar
haunts by moonlight, and then return before the
earliest stirrer is abroad."</p>

<p>Mr. Armsby in vain represented to him the fatigue,
the sleepless night, the night-air, the mental excitement,
which the execution of his scheme would
bring upon himself. His heart seemed to be set
upon the plan; and he expressed his determination
to accomplish the adventure by himself, if we declined
accompanying him. This, of course, was not
to be thought of; and, his resolution being taken, we
prepared to accompany him on his singular expedition.
Mr. Armsby very evidently did not much
relish the idea of exchanging his snug corner of the
chimney in possession, and his comfortable bed in
prospect, for a damp, chilly row of three or four
hours by moonlight. I, on the other hand, was just
of an age to enjoy anything which had the appearance
of novelty and the air of romance.</p>

<p>Our trusty boatmen were speedily roused from
their lair, and ordered upon this new and unexpected
service. They were soon in readiness; and we all
re-embarked, as well protected against the night-air

<!-- v2 page 131 -->

as broadcloth could make us. As soon as we had
pushed off, and cleared the shadow of the island,
we saw the moon, "rising in clouded majesty" just
above the waves, and shedding a long and tremulous
line of light upon the dancing waters. The scene
was truly enchanting. The slight murmur of the
waves, the measured dip of the flashing oars, and the
distant bark of the watchdog of the island we were
leaving behind us, were all the sounds which broke
the stillness of the midnight sea. The light, fleecy
clouds which accompanied the appearance of heaven's
"apparent Queen" were soon dispersed, and she
shone forth in matchless lustre. The magic air
which her silver light gave to the whole world of
waters was the more charming to us who had just
seen the orb of day sink in a sea of molten gold.
The stars stood out from the firmament with all
the sharpness and distinctness of a winter's night;
while the glimmering lights twinkled at unequal
intervals from the line of coast along which we
skirted, and the numerous islands amidst which we
threaded our devious way.</p>

<p>Thus we sped along, for the chief of the way in
silence, till at length we shot under the guns of the
Castle, and the town lay before us, seen dimly in
the uncertain moonlight. As we glided along to the
measured music of the oars, Colonel Wyborne's eyes
were fixed, with an earnestness almost painful, upon
the shadowy mass of buildings in the distance. His
thoughts were, doubtless, transported to the day, half

<!-- v2 page 132 -->

a century before, when he last approached his native
town by sea. How different the circumstances under
which he approached it then and now! Then, in the
pride of manhood, he walked over the waters in a
gallant ship, in the clear light of an autumnal day.
The wife of his love was by his side; troops of welcoming
friends stretched out their arms from the
shore to hail the wanderer's return. Though he had
spent many years amidst the superb cities and magnificent
ruins of Europe, and had dwelt as a familiar
friend in the bosom of the most gorgeous scenery and
time-hallowed relics of a classic world, still it seemed
to his true heart as if he had never gazed upon a
scene so lovely or so beloved as was present to his
filial eyes as he drew near his native land. Now, in
the spectral light of the moon, he glided like a ghost
to haunt the scenes of his former happiness. The
wife of his bosom, whose gentle hand was clasped in
his when he last moved over those waves, had been
for fifty years the latest tenant of his ancestral vault.
The numerous friends whose cordial grasp welcomed
him home were, with scarcely an exception, long
since gone from earth; and the few survivors were,
like him, transformed from men of the prime to faint
old men just tottering on the brink of the grave. A
thousand recollections of buried love, of vanished
youth, of half-forgotten friends, of well-remembered
griefs, of blighted hopes, of transitory joys, crowded
upon his musing soul.</p>

<p>At last the prow of our boat struck the stairs of

<!-- v2 page 133 -->

the Long Wharf, and our voyage was ended. Just
at that moment, the clock of the Old South Church
struck twelve, and was answered from the towers of
all the other churches in long-drawn-out, but sweet
and solemn tones. Mr. Armsby and I assisted Colonel
Wyborne to disembark, who then, leaning upon
our arms on either side, commenced his strange and
melancholy pilgrimage. The fifty years which had
elapsed since his departure from Boston had wrought
none of those changes in the appearance of the town
which the spells of modern speculation have in these
latter days often worked in a single lustrum. The
aspect of the place was almost unchanged. The population
had scarcely increased during that period, and
the small addition had been contented to fix their
habitations upon the large extent of unoccupied
ground within the peninsula, without laying their
parricidal hands upon the roofs which had sheltered
their fathers. As we slowly proceeded up King
(now State) Street, there were to be seen on either
side the same dwellings which our aged friend had
left when he took his last leave of the metropolis.
How different was that scene from the one which the
same ground now presents! Now it is metamorphosed
into one great granite temple to Mammon,
whose pavements are worn by the frequent feet of his
busy worshippers. The household gods have fled
from its precincts; the fire is quenched on the domestic
altar; the voice of woman and the laugh of childhood
are there heard no more. But on that night,

<!-- v2 page 134 -->

more than half a century since, the moon which
looked down upon the sleeping city bathed in her
silver beams a multitude of happy homes. The
houses, substantial yet elegant, stood betwixt ample
courtyards in front, and trim gardens behind. Old
trees overshadowed them; shrubs and flowers in their
season adorned them. Hospitality and religion sanctified
them. Now how changed!</p>

<p>As we gained the end of the wharf, and entered the
inhabited street, Colonel Wyborne seemed scarcely to
notice the familiar habitations of his friends on either
side, but with a hurried step pressed forward toward
the house in which he was born, and which was his
home during his brief abode in Boston. It was
situated on the right-hand side of the street. It
stood on the highest of three terraces of moderate
height, and was approached by as many flights of
stone steps, guarded on either side by iron balustrades,
of the fashion of the beginning of the century.
The grounds on either side were planted with evergreens,
and numerous trees of ornament and shade.
A heavy iron gate admitted you within the courtyard.
The house itself was of brick, painted of a
cream-color, Corinthian pilasters reaching from the
ground to the eaves, and with grotesque faces looking
from the tops of the windows.</p>

<p>When we had reached the house, our venerable
companion paused in manifest emotion. For a moment
he laid hold of the iron bars of the gate for
support; but his spirits soon rallied, and he regarded

<!-- v2 page 135 -->

the happy home of his childhood and of his married
life with sad composure. Strangers now inhabited
those apartments which were associated with his
earliest memories. Other children played in the
grounds which were his childish empire. Other
hearts which he knew not, and which knew not him,
were happy in the charities of domestic life within
those walls that had witnessed his happiest days.
Long he stood gazing upon that beloved home. He
seemed to forget our presence, and to be in the midst
of another age and a former generation. I have
witnessed many strange scenes in the course of my
pilgrimage; but none that I have seen returns upon
my memory so often, or seems so extraordinary, as
that moonlight walk. The attenuated form and
pallid features of our friend might well have befitted
an inhabitant of another world, returned to revisit
by the glimpses of the moon the spot on earth he
loved the best. The superstition which believes that
the spirits of the departed hover over those places
loved while on earth is one which even enlightened
natures have loved to indulge; but it is a chimera
born of ignorance and fear. The blessed spirit
which has put off "the vesture of decay," and broken
the fleshy chain that linked it to earth, yearns
not for the little point of space around which its
mortal affections clustered. If it ever returns to this
visible sphere, it is the chambers of the human heart
that it haunts; it is the beloved souls yet in
prison that it visits, and strengthens for the struggles

<!-- v2 page 136 -->

of earth, which are to fit them for the crowns
of heaven.</p>

<p>As we stood gazing at the old mansion, a female
form with a light in her hand passed across one of
the windows, thus giving us assurance that the house
was yet tenanted by more material forms than those
of memory and fancy. The circumstance seemed to
strike palpably upon Colonel Wyborne's heart, and
to give vitality, as it were, to his dream of the past.
It seemed for a moment as if he had only to open the
door, and to walk into the midst of his long-buried
household joys. But the mood soon passed away, and
he slowly turned his fixed regard from his former
home, and, resuming his hold upon his companions,
proceeded up the street. He now observed on either
hand the former residences of his early friends, every
one of which had passed into other hands, through the
lapse of time, or the chances and changes of the Revolution.
He paused to contemplate the old Town
House (then the State House), which was and is
full of the memory of old colonial quarrels between
the royal Governors and their Legislatures, and of
the machinery which set the ball of the Revolution in
motion. This historic edifice still stands, as little
changed as could be expected when we know that it
is at the mercy of a civic board.</p>

<p>We then stopped for a moment before the Old
Brick Church, almost opposite the Town House, and
surveyed with reverence the oldest building erected
by our fathers for the worship of God. We then

<!-- v2 page 137 -->

passed along Cornhill to the Province House, then
degraded from being the residence of the representatives
of royalty to some plebeian use, but still standing,
unshorn of any of its externals of rank. The
trees still waved in the courtyard; and the iron fence
which had surrounded it for more than a century still
seemed to tell the vulgar to keep their distance.
Many a festive image was called up before the mind's
eye of our companion by the sight of this scene of
provincial grandeur.</p>

<p>We then continued our walk until we came to the
house of my good aunt Champion, which had received
him and his bride under its hospitable roof on his first
arrival from Europe. This was almost the only one
of all the habitations of his many kindred and friends
which had not passed into strange hands. The sight
of its well-remembered walls seemed for a moment to
shake his resolution of returning to his retirement
without revealing his presence to any of his friends.
But the settled habit of seclusion was stronger than
his wish to see his dear old friend. The thought, too,
of the twenty years which had elapsed since they had
met, perhaps brought to his mind the changes which
years had worked in both of them, which would
make their last interview on the shore of time one of
melancholy emotions as well as of sad recollections.
We then proceeded across the Common to the foot
of Beacon Hill, a natural monument, which in an
evil hour was torn from its firm base, and buried in
the sea, to glut the insane cravings of the monster

<!-- v2 page 138 -->

speculation, which threatens to swallow up our
land.</p>

<p>At this distance of time I cannot recall all the
particulars of our midnight ramble. I remember
pausing to see the princely mansions of the Bowdoins,
Faneuils, the Vassals, sleeping in the moonlight.
Opposite the Faneuil House was the King's Chapel
churchyard, in a distant corner of which slumbered
whatever remained of Maria Wyborne. The gate
was locked, so that we could not enter the gloomy
precinct; but Colonel Wyborne pointed out to us the
spot with an almost cheerful air, as he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But a few days, and the gates of the resting-place
of my fathers will close forever on the last of their
race."</p>

<p>We visited, too, the North End, then as now the
most populous portion of the town; and as we
threaded its narrow streets, many well-known thresholds
greeted the eyes of the time-worn pilgrim,
which he had often passed in gay or in serious mood.
Passing hastily by them, however, and stopping but
a moment before the former residence of Cotton
Mather, his early pastor, we hastened back to the
wharf through some of the devious lanes which Colonel
Wyborne seemed to remember as distinctly as if
he had passed through them but yesterday. He
seemed exhausted by the fatigue of the unusual walk
and by the conflicting emotions which agitated his
soul. We emerged into King Street from an alley
about opposite his house. He stood earnestly looking

<!-- v2 page 139 -->

his last at the place he loved so well, and then
turned sadly away to return to the home of his declining
years. His heart seemed too full for words;
but, as he slowly walked down the wharf, he pressed
my arm, and said almost inarticulately,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell my dear friend, Mrs. Champion, what I have
done and seen to-night, and tell her that I shall spend
the remainder of my few days in more content and
satisfaction for this night's ramble. The earnest
longing of my heart to see once more these beloved
scenes is satisfied, and I shall die content."</p>

<p>When we had reached the spot where our boat was
in waiting, my revered friend tenderly embraced me
in his aged arms, and, giving me a tremulous "God
bless you!" sunk into his place, and supported him
self on the shoulder of his faithful servant. Mr.
Armsby took his leave with a cordial grasp of the
hand, and hastened to assume his seat. The oars fell
with a sudden plash into the water, and the boat was
soon gliding over the waves far from the shore. I
stood and watched its departing course as long as the
flashing of the oars in the moonbeams indicated its
pathway. At length nothing was to be seen but the
gleaming of the moonlight on the waves, and I turned
away in an inexplicable frame of mind, in which it
seemed to me as if I were but just awaking from a
strange mysterious dream.</p>

<p>I returned up the street, with my portmanteau in
my hand, and after some difficulty procured admission
at the Bunch of Grapes, a hostelry of no mean fame

<!-- v2 page 140 -->

in its day. The next day I spent with my good aunt
Champion, whose faith was hardly sufficient to make
her credit my story of her old friend having actually,
but a few hours before, been looking up at her windows.
Before night, I returned to my chambers at
Cambridge, with a fund of cheerful and of sadder
images over which to brood at leisure, and which, at
the end of half a century, still return in clearest
vision upon my memory whenever I call to mind
my visit to AN OCTOGENARY FIFTY YEARS SINCE.</p>

<h2>THE HAUNTED ADJUTANT;</h2>

<p>A TRADITION OF THE SIEGE OF BOSTON.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>"BY Jove, the ghost has a good taste in quarters!"
exclaimed the young Captain Hazlehurst, as
he stood with his back to a rousing fire (in "a gentlemanly
attitude," like Mrs. Todgers), and complacently
surveyed the comfortable apartment of which he had
just taken possession. And indeed there were few
gentlemen of his rank in his Majesty's army that
were better lodged than he. It was a spacious room,
on what Americans call the second, and Englishmen
the first, floor of a large old-fashioned house, situated
in a narrow street leading out of Hanover Street, far
down in the depths of the "North End" of Boston.
The house had been the residence of a patriotic gentleman,
who had found it convenient to take his
departure in such speed from the town, as the siege
was fast enclosing it in its iron embrace, that he had
left all his furniture and appliances of luxurious life
behind him as they stood. Several officers of higher
rank than its present occupant had successively inhabited it,

<!-- v2 page 144 -->

but, on one pretence or another, they had
all of them in succession exchanged it for other quarters.
They gave no credit, not they, to the foolish
stories which were rife among the common people
and the soldiery, to the discredit of the character of
the house. They begged it might be understood that
it was no superstitious folly that caused the shifting
of their quarters; but then, it was too far from parade,
or it was in too confined a situation, or the kitchen
chimney smoked, or there was some other very sufficient
reason for the removal.</p>

<p>And let no one think the worse of those gallant
gentlemen, if their actual motives did not exactly
correspond with these plausible pretences. Many a
hero has been afraid to go to bed in the dark, and
many a fire-eater, who would storm a battery of
cannon without flinching, might be frightened out of
his wits by a white sheet and a drag-chain. At least
it was so in the good old times, before ghosts were
snubbed, and sent to Coventry; when they were
welcomed with a fearful joy to the drawing-room fireside,
and before they were injuriously driven thence,
first to the nursery, and thence again to the servants'
hall, and at last reduced to scour out kettles, on their
knees, with the fat, foolish scullion in the kitchen.
Dear souls, you are a much abused generation! It
is no wonder that you are cowed, and are ashamed to
show your faces in good company. Confound this
march of mind! It has hardly left us a good comfortable
superstition to our backs!</p>

<!-- v2 page 145 -->

<p>Be this as it may, there stood the gallant Captain
Hazlehurst, looking round upon his new domain.
And a comfortable-looking domain it was, as I said
before. The walls were panelled in longitudinal compartments,
each bordered with the "egg-and-anchor"
carvings in which the souls of our forefathers delighted.
Two portraits adorned the side of the room
opposite the fireplace: one, of a beautiful girl of eighteen,
of that peculiar style which combines dark
flashing eyes with blond hair, the exquisite glow
of whose skin, and the inimitable finish of whose
point-lace ruffles could have owned no other hand
than Copley's; and the other, an elderly gentleman,
in a full-bottomed wig, and formal cataract of cravat
pouring down over his laced waistcoat, plainly the
work of an earlier and an inferior artist. Between
the windows on your left, as you turned what Lord
Castlereagh used to call "a back front" to the fire,
was a tall mirror, in a frame of tarnished gold, surmounted
by a bird of nondescript characteristics,
which a naturalist might class with eagles, with pelicans,
or with herons, at his pleasure. Beneath the
glass, stood a low, curiously carved chest of drawers,
the handles and key-holes flashing back the fire from
their glittering brasses. Upon this stood a Japan, or
rather a Chinese dressing-case, with curious drawers
in the centre, and comical little doors at the sides,
and gold mandarins, "with women's faces," and mandarinesses,
"with yet more womanish expressions,"
taking tea all over it with much contentment, upon

<!-- v2 page 146 -->

a glossy background. Opposite the glass stood the
bedstead, none of your modern French abominations
stuck upon the side of the wall like a hornet's nest,
but a substantial, solid, imposing four-poster, with
chintz draperies above, and draperies below, which
I am not upholsterer enough to describe. The bed
itself puffed up in all the elasticity of feathers, as
beds of any character were wont to do, before <i>paillasses</i>
and mattresses came in from France, with
Jacobinism and thin potations. The table in the
centre of the room was round, of shining mahogany,
its edges scalloped, its legs clasping large balls in
their claws, as if about to engage in a game of bowls.
The chairs were heavy and hair-seated, the backs
presenting a sort of mahogany lace-work, of a strange
pattern, and unfolding themselves outward at the top
in a bell-like expansion.</p>

<p>And then, if you turn and examine the mantel-piece,
it will reward your trouble. The curious carvings
of grotesque heads on either side, and the delicate
sculpture of fruits and flowers in the centre were the
work of no mean artificer. And then the Dutch tiles
guarding the orifice of the fireplace! Heavens! it is
strange that so much piety should have been left to
our ancestors, when their earliest ideas of saints and
patriarchs were derived from those earthen tablets!
What bandy-legged kings, and dumpy queens! What
squat prophets, and squab apostles! I see now, in
my mind's eye, King David ogling a Bathsheba, from
the roof of his house, whose portraiture excited my

youthful horror at the taste, rather than at the crime,
of his Hebrew majesty. But there they were in blue
and white, grim, grisly, and grotesque; the blazing
logs below lighting up their square faces and repairing
their halos with a light not their own. The
andirons, too, and the shovel and tongs were well
worthy a description; especially as they are likely
soon to become an extinct generation, whose very
name will be a puzzle to future antiquaries.</p>

<p>But my story is waiting for me, and will soon get
impatient. Still, you must take a glance at the roaring
wood fire, which goes crackling up the chimney,
and acknowledge its superiority over the pitiful grates
and subterranean furnaces, which are drying up the
present generation to mummies. If flesh be indeed
grass, anthracite will soon desiccate the American
public into a very creditable <i>hortus siccus</i>. Was there
anything else in the room demanding notice? Oh
yes, there was the carpet, a heavy Turkey one, half
worn, and evidently promoted, "like a crab, backward,"
from the parlor to the best chamber. On
either side of the fireplace was a closet, each with a
window and a window-seat, the one on the right-hand
side large enough to contain a bed for the Captain's
servant, who had stipulated for this arrangement
before consenting to accompany his master to a house
of so dubious a reputation.</p>

<p>"By Jove, the ghost has a good taste in quarters!"
exclaimed Captain Hazlehurst, rubbing his hands, and
then giving them one gentle pat together, expressive

<!-- v2 page 148 -->

of infinite content. "It is certainly much to his
credit to prefer such snug lodgings as these to
a mouldy church-yard or a damp, dilapidated old
ruin."</p>

<p>Then drawing up the easiest of the chairs to the
front of the fire (it is a strange instinct which always
tells a man which chair is the easiest!) he established
one foot on either andiron, and resigned himself to
the comforts of his situation in an attitude rather
redolent of ease than grace. But a handsome young
fellow of two-and-twenty may twist his limbs into
any posture without much danger of criticism.</p>

<p>And it was a night fitted for the intensest comfort.
The wind roared down the chimney; the snow was
dashed against the windows in fitful gusts; the old
elm which overshadowed the house groaned and
creaked as it tossed its huge arms about in the storm.
Tibullus himself could not have wished for one more
congenial to his notions of enjoyment, as he has recorded
them in his immortal couplet. Having thus
taken a survey of his new dominion, and imbibed as
much caloric as his sitting man was fitted to take in,
he naturally began to think about his supper.</p>

<p>"I wonder where that rascal John can be," said he,
a little testily; "he has had time enough to go to the
Green Dragon and back again fifty times since he
went out. But there he comes," he continued, in a
milder tone, as he heard a man's step ascending the
stairs; "but how happened it that I did not hear him
open the hall door?"</p>

<!-- v2 page 149 -->

<p>The steps ascended the stairs slowly and heavily,
and then came "tramp, tramp" along the entry, till
they appeared to stop at the door of the room.</p>

<p>"Come in, can't you!" called out the impatient
Adjutant (for he was adjutant, as well as captain, as
you shall presently hear). "What the devil are you
stopping for?"</p>

<p>Then recollecting that John might by possibility
come with both hands full (though fortune never
does), he jumped up, and incontinently flung the door
open to its utmost capacity of swing. And was not
John obliged to him for this timely assistance? Why,
bless you, he wasn't there! No! Who was there,
then? If anybody, it was that personage well known
in the best regulated families by the name of Mr.
Nobody. In short, there was nobody there.</p>

<p>"Whew!" softly whistled the Captain, "if this is
the ghost, he is a heavy-heeled lubber, and it's hard
if I can't catch him, and lay him, if not in the Red
Sea, at least in some of his own claret."</p>

<p>With these words he took a candle from the table,
and a stout regimental cane, such as officers wore in
those days at drills and off duty, from behind the door,
and proceeded coolly to search the hall and the chambers
opening out of it. But it was all to no purpose.
The ghost, if it were one, had vanished, and not left
so much as a "melodious twang" behind it.</p>

<p>"It's very strange," he soliloquized. "Could it be
that villain John, making game of me? If it be&mdash;but
no, it's impossible!"</p>

<!-- v2 page 150 -->

<p>And the impossibility was soon put beyond a
doubt, by a multitudinous stamping and kicking in
the porch, such as indicates a return from a walk
through a deep snow-storm, and then by a sudden
opening of the hall door, which admitted John, and
a furious draught of wind and snow by way of accompaniments.
The doors above banged to, the Captain's
light blew out, and a fresh stamping, kicking, and
shaking bore noisy evidence that the new-comer was
none other than John himself in the flesh. Captain
Hazlehurst stole back into his room, not caring to
acknowledge the extreme civility of his disembodied
visitor, in making him a call so very early after his
arrival; though, in his secret heart, he could not but
think him "most infernally polite." He had scarcely
resumed his chair and relighted his candle, when
the veritable John made his appearance, his shaggy
great-coat white with snow, and making altogether a
spectral appearance in very good keeping with his
whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Why, John," said his master, "I thought the
ghost must have got you, and my supper into the
bargain."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, your honor," cried John, setting down
his basket, and taking off his great-coat, "please don't
talk in that sort of way. The ghosts are made quite
mad-like when they hear themselves made fun of.
I was almost afraid to come up those creaking stairs.
My grandmother once"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind your grandmother just now, John,"

<!-- v2 page 151 -->

interrupted his master, "but let me see what you
have got in your basket; for I am hungry enough to
eat a ghost myself, if it should appear in the shape
of a boiled scrag of mutton, like the one at Oxford,
which was laid by eating him with mashed turnips
and melted butter."</p>

<p>John groaned in spirit at this blasphemy against
the powers of the air, as a Methodist may do when
some unlucky scapegrace raps out an oath in a stage-coach.
However, he proceeded to lay a snowy napkin
over the table, and then to produce from his
basket a cold chicken, some slices of ham, and bread
and butter and cheese, which he duly disposed upon
the board. From a yet lower deep he evoked a string
of sausages and a dozen potatoes in the prime of their
age. With a precision, which showed him to be an
old campaigner, he next deposited the potatoes in
the ashes upon the hearth, and taking down a small
saucepan from the closet, began to fry the sausages,
which soon sent up an aromatic perfume, that might
well summon to the presence any spirit yet in the
body, whatever its effect might be on one that had
shuffled off his mortal coil. When these conjurations
were over, he deposited the result with the other
comestibles upon the table, and then intimated to his
master that there was nothing to wait for.</p>

<p>While the young soldier was carrying the war
with spirit into the enemy's country, his faithful
squire was not idle in his yet unfinished vocation.
He took down a silver tankard, with a heavy lid

<!-- v2 page 152 -->

falling back on its hinges upon the solid handle, and
slicing the lemons, and heating the water, and mixing
the sugar, and pouring (I grieve to say) the rum, he
compounded that insidious concoction with which
our sires welcomed the noon, bade farewell to the
departing sun, and chased the shades of night. When
the ingredients were duly mixed, and the whole made
"slab and good," he set it down upon the glowing
coals, to acquire a new fire from without to reinforce
that within.</p>

<p>His supper ended, and his libation poured, Hazlehurst
prepared for bed. He could not help revolving
the sounds he had heard over in his mind, and he was
fully of the opinion that there was some trick designed
him by his comrades or some waggish rebels. He
thought it was entirely contrary to the etiquette of
the spirit-land for its accredited envoys to go creaking
about in clouted, hob-nailed shoes, like a live ploughman.
"Gliding," "skimming," "floating," "sailing,"
he well knew to be the appropriate mode of ghostly
locomotion, but as to stamping and dumping, he
believed them to be unworthy of any goblin of good
breeding and a liberal education. So he was resolved
to be upon his guard. John lingered about his master's
toilet as long as he could, and seemed loath to
depart.</p>

<p>"And so your honor doesn't believe there is any
ghost at all?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"Ghost!" his master responded, as he untied his
right garter, "I believe there's no ghost but has a

<!-- v2 page 153 -->

head to be broken, and a&mdash;hinder man to be kicked;
and so I advise all such gentry to keep out of my
reach!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! I wish your honor wouldn't talk in
that sort of way. My grandmother"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Plague take your grandmother," cried the Captain
peevishly, slipping his left leg out of his scarlet
unmentionables (they called them breeches in those
days), "you are half a granny yourself. I tell you
no ghost will dare to come within the reach of these
magic circles"&mdash;pointing as he spoke to the muzzles
of his pistols; "if they do, they'll find that there is
a spell in them that will soon send them packing to
the Red Sea."</p>

<p>He spoke thus in a raised tone of voice, and then
cocked and uncocked his pistols, that his words and
their "strange quick jar" might fall upon the ears of
the walls, if, peradventure, as often happens, they
were provided with them.</p>

<p>"But, Lord bless you! what good will they do,
sir?" persisted John. "I heard of a ghost once that
caught a brace of bullets in his hand, and flung them
back in the gentleman's face that fired them at
him."</p>

<p>"Then, I shall save my lead, at any rate," rejoined
the Captain, laughing; "but to bed with you, for I
am tired and sleepy." With these words he turned
into bed, and the unlucky John, after replenishing the
fire, and clearing away the things, was fain to do
likewise.</p>

<!-- v2 page 154 -->

<p>But though Captain Hazlehurst pretended to be
asleep, he was never more broad awake in his life.
He lay for a good while watching the flickering phantoms
which danced in the light of the wood fire upon
the panels of his chamber. And then he thought a
multitude of thoughts, for there are no such promoters
of thought as night and watchfulness. The steps
which he had heard in the evening certainly suggested
some of his meditations; but he was not superstitious,
and believed they appertained to some
being of flesh and blood, whom it was his business
not to be afraid of. As he had seen the door carefully
bolted, and had, beside, double-locked it and put the
key under his pillow, he felt tolerably secure from
any visitants, other than such as might make their
entrance through the keyhole, without some sufficient
warning of their approach. These thoughts, then,
soon vanished from his mind, and his imagination
was soon a thousand leagues away, disporting itself
in the glades of the park of his ancestors, watching
the deer in the fern, the swans on the stream, or the
whirring coveys as they rose from the cover. There
he saw himself, and perhaps a fairer form or two,
wandering through its paths, or sitting at the foot of
its old trees, in the light of that farewell sun which
ever sheds a Claude-like glow around our last day at
home, when we live it over again in other days and
distant climes.</p>

<p>And, perhaps, the scene changed to his ancestral
hall, and it was evening, and the lights shone bright

<!-- v2 page 155 -->

upon his father's erect form and thoughtful face, upon
his mother's placid brow and calm smile, upon the
manly figures of his brothers, and the graceful shapes
of his sisters, as he saw them all on the night before
his departure for America. And there were those
other forms, too, that had been with him in the park
(who were not exactly sisters, but who would have
been almost as much missed from the dream-circle as
they); they were there, too, and he was leading down
with them the contra-dance (for, alas! the waltz, and
even the quadrille, then were not), with interludes in
the intervals of the dance, which are very well to
dream about, but which it would be a breach of the
confidence reposed in me to reveal. And then he
thought, too, of the charming, the perplexing Clara
Forrester, his latest flame (for I grieve to say that my
hero was <i>un peu volage</i>), who had made more of an
impression upon him than he cared to admit, even to
himself, was within the power of a provincial beauty.
His visions, however, grew more and more indistinct,
and, like many a sleepless lover before him, he was
soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>He had not been long asleep when he was aroused
by a hurried shake, and a gasping entreaty to awake.
He instinctively seized his pistols, and was near
putting them to their natural uses without further
inquiry, when he was stopped by the voice of
John.</p>

<p>"Don't fire, Captain&mdash;don't fire, your honor. It's
the ghost&mdash;the ghost!"</p>

<!-- v2 page 156 -->

<p>"D&mdash;n the ghost!" exclaimed the Captain, provoked,
as gentlemen are apt to be, at being waked out
of their first sleep, "I've a great mind to make a
ghost of you, you blockhead."</p>

<p>"But don't you hear him, your honor?" cried John,
in an agony of terror, "don't you hear him walking
about over our heads, as if"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, can't you, and let me listen,"
said his master, whose attention was thoroughly
aroused by this intimation of the character of the
ghostly visitation. He listened, and heard the same
heavy tread, stepping backward and forward, with
slow and measured step, in the chamber directly over
his head.</p>

<p>"Give me my cloak, you villain," exclaimed Hazlehurst,
as he leaped out of bed and ensconced his feet
in his slippers, "and light the candle and come along
with me."</p>

<p>"And where are you going, sir?" inquired John,
with woe-begone face and chattering jaws.</p>

<p>"Going?" was the reply. "Why to see who it is
that is making that infernal noise upstairs, and make
him choose some other place for his promenade."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! your honor, pray don't&mdash;pray don't!
perhaps he'll fly away with the side of the house if
we provoke him."</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied the Captain coolly, "the
house don't belong to me. But make haste, and
come along."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I am afraid to go, indeed I am! Pray,

<!-- v2 page 157 -->

don't go, sir, for God's sake! I shall die if I go, indeed
I shall."</p>

<p>"Then stay, and be"&mdash;blessed, the Captain would
probably have said, as he snatched the candle which
John had just lighted out of his hand, had he not interrupted
him to say that if he were resolved to go,
he would go with him, as he was a good deal more
afraid to be left alone.</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said the Captain, as he led the
way, a pistol in one hand and his sword in the other,
followed by John with the candle up the creaking
staircase.</p>

<p>Reader, was it ever thy hap to be awakened in the
dead of the night by a mysterious noise in the kitchen?
and, urged by the instances of thy wife or sister, hast
thou descended, poker-armed, to the eerie spot? I
doubt not thou art a valiant man, a proper fellow of
thy hand, but tell me true (for doth not an author
stand to his reader in the relation of a father confessor?
Fear not that I shall betray the secrets of the
confessional!), did not thy manly heart go pit-a-pat as
thou approachedst the fatal door and puttedst thy
hand upon the lock, the turning of which might reveal
to thy sight a ferocious band of robbers, whiskered to
the eyes and armed to the teeth? And didst thou
not wish in thy secret soul that thy desire to appear
a man of prowess in the eyes of thy womankind had
suffered thee to lie quietly, with thy head covered in
the bed-clothes, saying unto thyself, "Lo! is it not the
wind?" And when, on opening the door with a desperate

<!-- v2 page 158 -->

thrust, thou hast discovered a whiskered robber,
indeed, and one well-armed, but of the feline, not
felon, race, with her head stuck in the cream-jug, its
milky whiteness on her sable fur testifying to her
crime, and a heap of upturned trays bearing evidence
to her desperation, didst thou not feel thy bosom's
lord sit lightly on his throne, and didst thou not receive
the gratulations of thy fair instigators, and sip
thy creamless coffee the next morning, with more
contentment than if thou hadst sacrificed to thy insulted
household gods a hecatomb of burglarious varlets?
If such has ever been a part of thy experience,
thou canst appreciate the sensations of master and
man as they ascended with noiseless step the stairs
which led to the next floor.</p>

<p>Pardon this digression, dear reader. Your confessions
in the premises shall be sacredly kept secret.
But it was necessary for the due preservation of the
unities (for which I am an Aristotelian stickler), that
my characters should have time to get upstairs. As
they approached the door the steps ceased suddenly,
as if the owner of them had paused to listen. Who
could he be? It clearly could not be the cat. For,
first, they had no cat; and, secondly, no cat could
have made such a fearful tramping, unless, indeed, it
had been the prime minister of the Marquis of Carabas,
the redoubtable Puss in Boots himself.</p>

<p>I have the greatest tenderness for my hero's reputation,
but my duty as a faithful historian obliges me
to say that there was the slightest possible nervous

<!-- v2 page 159 -->

contraction of his left arm as he seized the lock of the
door, to throw it open, having slipped his sword under
his arm to enable him to do it. He had led his company
up Bunker's Hill without flinching, to be sure,
but this was an entirely different case. There is a
wide range allowable to tastes in the matter of throat-cutting,
as well as in the rest of the fine arts. A man
may be ready enough to submit to this elegant depletion
on a field of battle, with all the enlivening concomitants
of such a scene, who might reasonably
object to the operation at the top of an old house, in
the middle of the night.</p>

<p>However this might be, he flung open the door to
its utmost extent, at the same moment recovering his
sword and presenting his pistol. He was prepared
for the worst, and resolved to encounter the enemy in
whatever shape he might appear. He presented a
figure at once civil and military; his night-cap, and
night-gown fluttering under his cloak, fairly representing
the <i>toga</i>, while the "sword and pistol, which
did come at his command," as at that of the celebrated
Billy Taylor, might well stand for the <i>arma</i>,&mdash;for
making which last yield to the first, Tully was so
well quizzed by the Edinburgh Reviewers of his day.
There he stood, ready to kill, slay, and destroy any
and every antagonist, however formidable. And for
whom was all this energy so well got up? Who was
the object upon whom this well-cooked wrath was to
be bestowed? Bless you, nothing at all! The very
identical Mr. Nobody who had walked up stairs early

<!-- v2 page 160 -->

in the evening, and stopped at the door below on his
way up! There was no sign of any mortal creature
near!</p>

<p>"The devil!" exclaimed the Captain, as he lowered
the point of his sword and the muzzle of his pistol,
and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Lord! sir, don't mention him, or perhaps he'll
come back again," ejaculated the trembling John,
who was peeping, with a foolish face of fear, over
his master's shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is very strange!" monologized that gentleman.
"What can be the meaning of it?" And stepping
gently into the room he examined it and its closets
with all care, but without any clue to the mystery.</p>

<p>But just as he had completed his search, probing
the darker recesses with his sword, "and wounding
several shutters and some boards," without any satisfactory
result, his attention was arrested by a tremendous
crash in the room below. One leap brought
him to the door of the room, two more to the head of
the stairs, and a hop, skip, and jump in addition, to the
door of his own chamber. And there he saw a scene
of confusion which might well have roused the ire
of Moses, the meekest, or of Job, the most patient, of
men. The bed-clothes were stripped off the bed,
and coiled up on the floor like a spectral boa constrictor.
The andirons lay lovingly together on the
top of the deserted bed. The tongs bestrode, like a
Colossus, the dressing-case on the chest of drawers
under the glass, while the shovel seemed to regard

<!-- v2 page 161 -->

its old companion's exploit with a chuckling laugh of
satisfaction, from the easy-chair in the corner of the
room. And to complete the scene, the table in the
centre of the room was overturned, and, with all its
miscellaneous contents of books, glasses and <i>etceteras</i>,
lay in one wide heap of ruin upon the floor.</p>

<p>All this was not at first visible, as the fire was
almost out, and panting John toiled after his master,
if not in vain, at least so slowly as to put him entirely
out of patience. But when the candle came, and the
chaos was revealed, who shall paint the rage of the
master or the dismay of the man? "The <i>devil!</i>"
exclaimed the choleric Captain, with added emphasis,
and I am afraid I must allow that he made use of
other expletives of more significance and weight, as
he danced about the apartment in a most heroic passion.
For it is a melancholy fact that the British
armies did "swear terribly" in America in Captain
Hazlehurst's day, even as they did "in Flanders" in
that of Captain Shandy. If the recording angel
undertook to write down all the oaths the gallant
Captain uttered, he must have gone nigh to have
written up his wings; and if, in consideration of the
provocation, he should have attempted to drop a tear
upon every one of them, to blot it out forever, he
must have infallibly cried his eyes out. Whatever
may have been the proceedings in Heaven's chancery,
I am afraid that just where he was, Captain Hazlehurst
would have maintained that he felt the better
for the effort.</p>

<!-- v2 page 162 -->

<p>But, be that as it may, as soon as his first transports
of anger and amazement were over, the Captain
made a minute examination of the chamber and the
house, but without finding any trace of the perpetrator
of these deeds. He was all the more convinced
that he was made the victim of a practical joke, as
he could not believe such pranks worthy the gravity
of disembodied, or the dignity of evil spirits; but he
could not refuse to allow that the joke, if it were
one, was well done. Poor John, on the other hand,
whose notions of the moral or the social proprieties
of the inhabitants of a world he knew very little
about, were much less exalted than his master's, laid
the whole blame upon their airy shoulders. It was
as much as he could do to command himself sufficiently,
after the Captain had finished his researches,
to put the room to rights again, fearing lest some
spectral hand should resent his interference with the
admired disorder it had created. But no such displeasure
was manifested, and after the bed had been
readjusted, the Captain retired to it again, marvelling
much at the events of the night. He lay long awake
pondering upon them, and neither he nor his man
fell asleep till the neighboring clock had told that the
small hours were fast growing into the larger ones.
It is no wonder, then, that they overslept themselves,
and that, when he awoke, his curiosity as to his
adventures of the night should be merged for the
moment in his fears of being late at the morning
parade. His hurry would allow no time for remark

<!-- v2 page 163 -->

from his attendant, whose mind was full of nothing
else, while the business of the toilet was proceeding.
Captain Hazlehurst, however, found time to enjoin it
upon John, as he was giving the last sprinkle of
powder to his plastered and pigtailed head, to say
nothing about the night's adventures, as he valued
his favor, till he had his permission. His determination
was, he said, to sift the matter thoroughly, and,
in the mean time, he wished no reports to be spread
of what had happened, as it might interfere with his
investigation. With these injunctions he left the
mortified John in great vexation, as he had been
reckoning on the pleasures of telling the ghost story
as his only compensation for his fright, and hurried
with all the speed he could command to the parade-ground
on the Common.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>YOU were late at parade this morning, Captain
Hazlehurst," said Lord Percy to his young
adjutant, as he called for the orders of the day, immediately
after breakfast.</p>

<p>"I have no excuse to offer, my lord," was the
deferential reply, "excepting my removal to new
quarters at the other extremity of the town; for I am
afraid that my having overslept myself would be regarded
by your lordship as rather an aggravation
than a palliation of my dilatoriness."</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," answered his lordship,
who was somewhat of a martinet, "but be more
careful in future; that's all. But where are your
new quarters, Hazlehurst?" he continued, his disciplinarian
gravity relaxing into a friendly smile, for
Hazlehurst stood high in his good graces.</p>

<p>"At Mr. Vaughan's house, at the North End, my
lord," responded the Captain.</p>

<p>"What, the haunted house!" exclaimed Lord
Percy, laughing, "why, you are a bolder fellow than
I took you for, my lad. I hope the ghost did the
honors of his mansion like a gentleman, and treated
you with becoming hospitality."</p>

<!-- v2 page 165 -->

<p>"I had no reason to complain, my lord," was the
guarded response.</p>

<p>"I trust that your oversleeping yourself this morning
had nothing to do with any nocturnal merry-making
with any honest fellow of the last generation,
or flirtation with any of the rebel grandmothers, who
look so temptingly down upon us from some of these
old picture-frames," pointing, as he spoke, to some
lovely forms with which the pencil of Blackburn
had decorated the walls of his parlor.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort, I assure you, my lord," replied
Hazlehurst, "no boon companions and no ladye
love, whether in the body or out of the body, had any
thing to do with my tardiness this morning, which I
shall take care shall not occur again."</p>

<p>"Right, right," said the son of "Duke Smithson
of Northumberland." "I have every reason to be
satisfied with you in every respect. But, by the way,
how is Miss Forrester?" he proceeded, for his lordship
had a discursiveness of discourse, and a talent
for knowing all the details of the garrison gossip,
which vindicated his hereditary claim to cousinship
with royalty.</p>

<p>"She was well, my lord," answered Hazlehurst,
"when I had the honor of seeing her last. But that
was not yesterday, nor the day before."</p>

<p>"Lovers' quarrels&mdash;lovers' quarrels," said his lordship,
laughingly; then added, more seriously, "but,
my dear Hazlehurst, pardon me if I ask whether you
have considered what may be Sir Ralph and Lady

<!-- v2 page 166 -->

Hazlehurst's opinion of a New England daughter-in-law,
should you be disposed to present them with
one?"</p>

<p>"I have not given the subject any consideration
at all, my lord," replied Hazlehurst quickly, "because
I have no intention of subjecting them to any
such trial at present. I beg that your lordship will
give no credit to the talk of the mess-table or of the
assembly-room on such subjects, at least where I am
concerned. My sword is my bride till this war is
over, and I shall suffer no rivals in my affections, of
flesh and blood."</p>

<p>"Bravo! bravo! Hazlehurst," answered Lord Percy;
"these be brave words. Only I hope that you will
not have to serve for your bride of steel as long as
Jacob did for Laban's daughter. Excuse my caution,
which I am glad to know is not wanted. But I advise
you to do as I used to do when I was addicted
to falling in love."</p>

<p>"How was that, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Always to take care to be in love with two or
three at the same time. You will find it an excellent
rule, I assure you."</p>

<p>Hazlehurst joined cordially in the laugh with which
the stout earl uttered this apothegm, and assured his
noble commander that he would not neglect his advice.</p>

<p>"Here is your orderly-book," added his lordship,
handing it to him; "I take it for granted we shall
meet at the assembly to-night, where I trust I shall
see you reduce my instructions to practice."</p>

<!-- v2 page 167 -->

<p>"Never fear, my lord, but you will find me an apt
scholar in love as well as in war. I only wish I
could hope to rival your lordship in either service."</p>

<p>To this his lordship replied only by a good-natured
nod, which the adjutant understood to be his signal
to take his leave, which he accordingly made haste
to do.</p>

<p>"Confound that Clara Forrester," soliloquized Captain
Hazlehurst, as he walked slowly along Hanover
Street, after he had discharged his regimental duties,
"what is there about her that plays the devil with
me, in a way that no other woman ever did before?
It can't be her beauty or her accomplishments, for I
have seen her superiors in both. I don't know though,
on the whole, as to her beauty," he said to himself, in
a tone of more deliberation. "It's a peculiar style,
to be sure, but she's devilish handsome, there is no
doubt about that. And as to her accomplishments,
what have they to do with the matter, I should like
to know? It must be this cursed siege, which shuts
us all up so close together. Well, I have not been
to see her for these three days, and I sha'n't be in a
hurry to call on her, after her flirtation with that
puppy Bellassis, I can tell her. She shall see that I
am not dependent upon her, that I'm resolved upon."</p>

<p>As the gallant Captain had just made this valiant
resolution, he found himself opposite the house of the
Hon. James Forrester, one of his Majesty's council,
&amp;c., &amp;c. This house was situated in Hanover Street,
just before you come to the turning into Duke Street,

<!-- v2 page 168 -->

in which were Hazlehurst's quarters. For in those
days you must know that the North End was (pardon
the Hibernianism, my maternal grandfather was
an Irishman) the West End of the town. There did
the great body of the colonial court and aristocracy
reside. Far be it from me to insinuate that this circumstance
of juxtaposition was any element in the
determination of the Captain to take up his new quarters.
But so it was. And as he accidentally raised
his eyes to the window of Mr. Forrester's house, just
as he was internally ejaculating the doughty resolution
just recited, he caught a glimpse of a pair of sunny
eyes smiling upon him from between two flowering
shrubs, which stood upon the window seat, and the
next minute he was standing in the porch thundering
away at the knocker.</p>

<p>People may say what they please about dreary
dilapidated houses, haunted by old dead men, but if
I had a young son, or nephew, or ward (which, God
be praised, I have not), I should warn them to avoid
the bright and cheerful homes haunted by young live
women. These are the haunted houses to be afraid
of. And, no doubt, they would take my advice. At
least, I am sure I did whenever my grandfather, or
uncle, or aunt gave me any such admonitions, "in
my hot youth, when George the Fourth was King."
"Never mind the <i>old</i> witches," a gentleman celebrated
in civil and military life, of the last generation, used
to say, when speaking of the witches of his native
town of Salem, "never mind the <i>old</i> witches, it is

<!-- v2 page 169 -->

the <i>young</i> witches that do all the mischief!" And
I incline to think that he was more than half
right.</p>

<p>I have a great mind to seize upon the opportunity,
while my hero is waiting for the knocker to be
answered, to give my friendly readers some account
of him. I have been waiting for a chance to put in
a word on the subject ever since I began. But the
tide of events has swept me on with such resistless
force that I have not had a moment to take breath.
Indeed, my plan is epic. I have plunged <i>in medias
res</i>, and it is about time for the hero, sitting over his
wine with his mistress, or some Ph&oelig;nician Amphitryon,
to relate his birth and parentage, "his breed,
seed, and generation," and all the surprising adventures
that had preceded his appearance in their
domains. But lest I should find no passage recorded
in this true history to that effect, I think I will fill up
this pause in the march of the story with the little I
know of his previous history. And little enough it
is. If any reader asks me for his story, I can only
answer in the words of the knife-grinder&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Story! God bless you, I have none to tell, sir!"</p>

</div>

<p>My hero then, in short, bore the baptismal and
patronymic appellations of Charles Hazlehurst. He
was the eldest son of a Somersetshire baronet. He
was six feet high, with broad shoulders, a deep chest,
and a clean leg. I can't tell you the color of his hair,
for I never saw it without that powder which has

<!-- v2 page 170 -->

passed away with so many of the virtues and graces
of the last age.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"God bless their pigtails, though they're now cut off!"</p>

</div>

<p>When to this I add that he had a round, ruddy face,
clear blue eyes, and the most perfect of teeth, I trust
my readers will take my word for it that he was as
dangerous a <i>Cupidon d&eacute;chain&eacute;</i> as ever disguised himself
in a red coat and breeches, wore epaulets instead
of wings, and used a regimental sword for a
bow and arrows. In addition to this you will please
to remember that he was but two-and-twenty, which
is an essential item in the inventory of his perfections.
I am well aware that objection will be made
to his claims as a lady-killer, on the score of his rosy
cheeks and blue eyes. But you should recollect, my
dear madam, that your thin, black-eyed, sinister-looking,
"sublime, sallow, Werter-faced men" had
not then come into fashion. And so you must excuse
the taste of your grandmothers, who thought health
and good humor main ingredients in manly beauty.
As to the number of times he had been in love, I am
unable to say with anything like accuracy, as I have
not as yet received returns from all the towns where
he went on the recruiting service, or was stationed
in garrison, before his regiment was ordered to
America. Should they arrive in time, I shall add
them in an appendix, reduced to a tabular form for
convenience of reference. If there is anything on
which I do pride myself, it is the business-like manner
in which I do up my work.</p>

<!-- v2 page 171 -->

<p>So much for love; and now for war. He had
"fleshed his maiden-sword,"&mdash;figuratively, for he
didn't kill anybody,&mdash;at the modern Chevy Chase of
Lexington,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Made by the Earl Percy."</p>

</div>

<p>He attracted attention by his good conduct on that
unlucky occasion, but he chiefly distinguished himself
at the battle of Bunker's Hill. On that famous
day he led his company up the hill, under the murderous
fire of the rebels, twice, his captain having
been killed in the first attempt to dislodge the enemy
from their entrenchments. As a reward for his gallantry
on that occasion, he obtained his captaincy;
and, the adjutant of his regiment being killed at the
same time, and the number of officers being sadly
reduced by the fatal aim of the American marksmen,
he was appointed to fill that station also, until other
arrangements could be made.</p>

<p>But it would be cruel to keep him waiting on the
steps any longer, in one of the coldest days of that
bitter winter. However, he felt warm enough, nor
did he feel in any violent hurry to have the door
opened. Have you no recollection, my reader, of
the queer sensation, after you had rung the bell at
the door of your particular princess, and when you
had a feeling as if you might be left to do something
desperate, if you got in, with which you awaited the
servant's approach, hardly knowing whether to be
glad or sorry to hear that she was not at home?
There is nothing like it, unless it be the odd feeling

<!-- v2 page 172 -->

when you have rung the bell at the door of your particular
friend, for the purpose of asking him to accompany
you to the "tribunal of twelve paces," at daybreak
the next morning. But I postpone any further
reflections until my chapter on bell-pulls.</p>

<p>After a rather longer interval than was usual in that
well regulated household (I once knew a famous man
who used to say that he judged of the domestic management
of a house by the space which intervened
between the ringing of the bell and the opening of the
door), the portal was expanded by a particularly ugly
negro, whom Hazlehurst did not recollect to have
ever seen before about the premises. Upon asking
whether Miss Clara were at home, the new porter
made an inarticulate sort of sound, which the visitor
chose to consider as an affirmative, and walked in
without further ceremony. He was left to open the
parlor door himself, for the attendant spirit took no
further notice of him. He accordingly ushered himself
into the comfortable apartment where Miss Forrester
sat, diffusing an air of cheerfulness throughout
it, even beyond that (at least our adjutant thought so)
dispensed by the good logs that blazed upon the
hearth. The scarlet curtains, the pleasant window-seats,
with their velvet cushions, the plants that
were placed upon them to catch a glimpse of the
wintry sun, the thick Turkey carpet, and all the
appointments of the parlor (for in those days drawing-rooms
were not), spoke to the heart that comfort
was a word understood in New England at least, if

<!-- v2 page 173 -->

nowhere else beyond the precincts of the fast-anchored
isle.</p>

<p>The front windows looked into the street, as my
readers may have partly gathered, and those on
either side of the fireplace opened upon a thin slice
of garden which extended down to the street, and
stretched and expanded itself far behind the house,
the shrubs and fruit trees all glittering, to the finest
ramifications of their smallest twigs, with the snow
which had fallen the night before. On one side of
the door, opposite the fireplace, was a large mahogany
book-case, with glass doors and resplendent
brasses, containing the library of Miss Forrester,
the books bound uniformly and stamped with her
name. There was the pabulum upon which our
grandmothers nourished their intellectual natures.
Good, hearty food, i' faith! None of your modern
kickshaws which the pastry-cooks of the circulating
libraries supply to tickle the palate withal, but solid
substantial viands, such as good master cook furnishes
forth to replenish the heart with its best blood.</p>

<p>There the Spectator sat with his club, in his short
face, long wig, rolled stockings and high-cut shoes,
over a squat bottle of wine, in the frontispiece of his
closely printed twelves. The Tattler, too, was to be
seen in his original fine-paper quarto. History, also,
there was good store, arid biography, such as those
days afforded. And was not Shakspeare there, and
Ben Jonson, and Spenser, and Milton? Sir Charles
Grandison, too, looked ready to step down and bow

<!-- v2 page 174 -->

over the hand of his fair mistress, so like was the
scene to the dear cedar parlor of "the venerable
circle." I don't know whether it will do to say it,
but so it was, there stood Tom Jones and Joseph
Andrews and Roderick Random and Peregrine
Pickle, as bold as lions, alongside of Tristram
Shandy, who did not look the least bit ashamed of
himself. My fair readers must excuse my heroine
for keeping such rollicking company, for they must
remember that she had not the privilege they enjoy
of the pious conversation of Sir Lytton Bulwer (or
Sir Edward Lytton, or whatever title please his ear),
or of Monsieur Victor Hugo, or of the epicene
George Sand. She had no choice, poor thing; and,
upon my word, I never could perceive that she was a
jot the worse for their society. In the other corner of
the room, answering to that filled up by the book-case,
was what was in those days termed a <i>buffet</i>, a closet
without doors, with its shelves loaded with the curious
old plate, and rare glass and China, which had been
accumulating for generations in the family.</p>

<p>Miss Forrester sat upon a curiously carved settee,
with devices of flowers and birds in choice mahogany
on the back, which looked like one uncommonly
broad-bottomed arm-chair, or, by'r lady, like two single
chairs rolled into one, cushioned with green damask,
and drawn up to the table in the centre of the
room, and inclining in an angle of&mdash;I am not mathematician
enough to tell the exact number of degrees, say
forty-five&mdash;to the fire. Her work-basket was by her

<!-- v2 page 175 -->

side, which she graciously removed to the table, and
made room on the settee for Captain Hazlehurst, when
he had made his advancing bow,&mdash;a very different
thing, let me tell you, from the shrug and jerk,
performed chiefly by the antipodes of the head, with
which your modern exquisite "shakes his ambrosial
curls and gives the nod," when he enters a room.
And when they were sitting there side by side, I
protest, I don't believe that there was a handsomer
couple in all his Majesty's dominions. Clara Forrester
was&mdash;but I won't describe her. I never could describe
a pretty woman. And, for that matter, who
ever could? Suffice it to say, she was a blonde, with
a profusion of fair hair, I doubt not, but its color was
concealed by that plaguy powder; and yet I can't
say the effect was unbecoming to her pure brow, her
blooming, downy cheeks, and sweet mouth. And that
morning cap had a most coquettish and killing air.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"And then her teeth, and then, oh Heaven! her eye!"</p>

</div>

<p>It was as wicked and roguish an eye as you would
wish to see on a winter's day looking into yours by
the side of a good fire. And then her hand, and her
foot, and her shape! But I won't go on. If you can't
see her, just as she was sitting there, it's of no use
for me to be trying to fit your mind's eye with a pair
of spectacles. It's your fault, and not mine, reader,
if you don't see her sitting in that old-fashioned
room, in the glittering light of that clear winter morning
of seventy years ago.</p>

<!-- v2 page 176 -->

<p>I don't know how it was, but Hazlehurst had not
sat by her side a minute, when he felt all the wrath
he had been nursing for three days, to keep it warm,
oozing out of the palms of his hands, like Acres's
courage, and no more recollected Major Bellassis
(whom he had just before, in violation of the articles
of war, and of the respect due to his superior officer,
irreverently styled a puppy) than if there had been
no such dashing sprig of nobility in existence.</p>

<p>I might give the details of their conversation; but
I don't know that it would be quite fair, as it was
communicated to me in confidence. But there was
nothing particular, that is, <i>very</i> particular, upon
my honor. They talked of the news of the siege, of
the advances of the rebels, of the probabilities of repulsing
them. And then they diverged to the small
talk of the garrison, the rise and fall of the flirtation
stocks, and the variations of the match market. Then
they talked of the last review, and of the comical
figure that Colonel Cobb, the <i>ci-devant jeune homme</i>,
cut when he was thrown from his new horse, and
could not get up again,&mdash;not because he was hurt, but
because he was too tightly girt. And the assemblies,
too, and the private theatricals, afforded endless topics
of mirthful discourse. Though there was not much
that was enlivening in the siege itself to those who
were shut up in the narrow limits of the beleaguered
town, still youth and good spirits would make their
way, and find a thousand divertisements for speeding
the weary hours. God bless them! what would this

<!-- v2 page 177 -->

working-day world be without youth and good
spirits?</p>

<p>"And so I hear," said the fair Clara, at last, when
they had pretty well exhausted all the topics which a
three days' absence had accumulated, "and so I hear
that you have come into our neighborhood. And,
pray, how do you like your landlord?"</p>

<p>"My landlord!" exclaimed Hazlehurst in some
surprise. "I am as well satisfied with him as a man
usually is with himself; for I am the only landlord
that I have to my knowledge, unless indeed it be the
quartermaster-general."</p>

<p>"Ah, you put it off very well!" persisted Miss
Forrester; "but be honest now, has not Captain
Honeywood paid his respects to you yet? He is
much too fine a gentleman, I am sure, to have
neglected it."</p>

<p>"I have not the honor to understand you, Miss
Forrester," replied the Captain. "It was never my
chance to hear the gallant Captain's name before.
Pray, in what service might he be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the sea service, you may be sure,"
answered the lady; "but did you never hear of the
noble Captain, who makes continual claim, as papa
says" (papa was a lawyer), "to the Vaughan
house?"</p>

<p>"Never, upon my honor," protested Hazlehurst.
"And I shall feel myself especially obliged if you
will introduce me to his acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" exclaimed Clara, laughing, "but

<!-- v2 page 178 -->

I have no objection to talking a little about him
behind his back."</p>

<p>"That is better yet," said Hazlehurst. "It is to
be hoped then that his character is bad enough to
be well talked over."</p>

<p>"Bad enough to gratify your warmest wishes, I
assure you. I believe he was as wicked an old
villain as you could possibly desire to see," replied
Clara.</p>

<p>"Many thanks for the compliment to my taste,"
answered the Captain, bowing, "but did you ever
happen to know this amiable individual?"</p>

<p>"Know him?" cried Clara. "Good Heavens! why,
he's been dead these sixty-five years!"</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed Hazlehurst, "dead sixty-five
years, and yet lay claim to a good piece of real
estate! What an unconscionable old dog! I only
hope his example will not be very extensively followed."</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped not," responded the lady, "but
if you really do not know about the claimant to
your premises, I will tell you all I know about him,
which is little enough."</p>

<p>"You will lay me under everlasting obligations,"
bowed the Captain, as he inclined his ear to her in
mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"Well, then, all I know about him is," resumed
Miss Forrester, "that he was a master of a vessel
out of this port, some hundred years since, who
went to sea, and was gone five or six years without

<!-- v2 page 179 -->

any tidings being heard of him. At last, however,
he returned in a ship from Europe, telling that
his vessel was lost in the East Indies, and no soul
was saved but himself, who was taken up by a
Dutch vessel, and, after various adventures, found
his way home again. This story would have done
very well, had he not soon made a great display of
wealth, among other things building the house in
which you (and people do say <i>he</i>) now reside. This
went on for a few years, and by dint of giving good
dinners, going regularly to meeting and Thursday
lectures, and being eminently liberal to one or two
of the most influential ministers, he was getting to
be in very good odor with the Boston public. There
were those, to be sure, who still marvelled whence
he got his wealth. Some thought it must be witchcraft,
but the majority, more charitable, believed it
to be only piracy and murder. Their suspicions
were confirmed by the occasional moody and depressed
turns to which Captain Honeywood was
subject. People thought that there was something
weighing upon his mind. This, however, did not
prevent a young lady of one of the chief families
from being willing to marry him, and the ceremony
was about to be celebrated with all the pomp which
the times permitted, when they were prevented by
an untoward occurrence. It so happened that the
very night before the marriage was to take place, a
sloop of war came into the harbor, with orders to
arrest our amiable friend, and carry him to England

<!-- v2 page 180 -->

for trial, on a charge of murder and piracy. It
seems that a sailor had been arrested for a recent
impropriety of this sort, who had purchased his own
pardon by revelations touching our valuable townsman.
The Captain of the sloop-of-war came up to
the Province House, and communicated his orders
to Governor Phipps, who, with the sheriff and other
officials, proceeded to effect the arrest. But on arriving
at the scene where it was to be completed,
they found themselves too late. The bird was
flown. They searched the house and the neighborhood,
and offered large rewards, but all was in vain.
The Captain was never heard of again. The disaffected
in the colony hinted that notice was given
to Honeywood, by persons in authority, of the design
to take him, in time to favor his escape.
Others, and this was the opinion of no small number,
believed that the devil had for once helped a
friend upon a pinch, and spirited him away. Some
supposed that he had concealed himself in some
secret place designed for this emergency in his
house, and had there starved to death. At any rate,
he was heard of no more. In due time sentence
of outlawry was passed upon him, and his house,
with his other property, declared forfeited to the
crown. When it was sold, and the purchaser took
possession of his estate, it was found to be more than
the crown of England could do to give him a quiet
possession. The pranks that were played, the noises
that were heard, the sights that were seen, among

<!-- v2 page 181 -->

them the apparition of the very Captain himself,
are not to be told. The intruder was soon forced
to quit the premises. All who subsequently ventured
to occupy the house were ejected in a like
summary manner. For years it stood untenanted.
Property in the street fell in value, and people were
afraid to pass through it after nightfall. After many
years had elapsed, an elderly man arrived from England,
with the avowed intention of spending the rest
of his days here. He could not be suited to a house
to his mind, and at length pitched upon this deserted
one. He bought it at a low price, and, in spite of its
ill name, fitted it up for his residence, and there spent
the remainder of his days. He shook his head when
questioned as to the claims of its former possessor,
and gave people to understand that he could tell
much if he chose. So the ill-repute of the mansion
continued unimpaired. It was a singular fact that he
found the lady of the love of the former inhabitant
still unmarried, and by some strange coincidence they
married each other, and lived together in as much
comfort as the ghost of his predecessor would allow.
That is his portrait that you may have seen in the
chamber over the right-hand parlor"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And who," interrupted Hazlehurst, "is the young
lady in the same room?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Clara, "is the portrait of his
granddaughter, the only child of his only daughter,
the child of his old age,&mdash;my dear friend Fanny
Vaughan. For you must know that after his death

<!-- v2 page 182 -->

his heiress married Colonel Vaughan, and this is the
way in which the house came into the Vaughan
family."</p>

<p>"And, pray," inquired the Captain, "did this inexorable
claimant continue to keep up his claim to
his property under the Vaughan dynasty?"</p>

<p>"It is so asserted and believed by the common
people," said Clara, laughing; "it would be a pity to
spoil so good a story, and any disclaimers on the
part of the reigning family have been always received
with a proper degree of incredulity. But
here ends my story, and I must say that I think it a
passably good one."</p>

<p>As she ceased speaking, she stretched out her hand
to the bell-pull and gave it a gentle pressure. Hazlehurst
thanked her gayly for her narrative, which he
protested was one of the best authenticated ghost
stories he had ever heard. As he was speaking, the
same negro who had opened the door for him entered
with a salver of wine and cake.</p>

<p>"Where is James?" inquired Miss Forrester, with
an air of the slightest possible vexation. The servant
replied by a succession of grotesque gestures,
and some sounds which seemed to be unintelligible
gibberish to Hazlehurst.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the young mistress, and dismissed
the uncouth attendant.</p>

<p>"You seem to have a new page of honor," said
Hazlehurst, smiling. "I do not think I have ever
seen this groom of the chambers before."</p>

<!-- v2 page 183 -->

<p>"No," replied Clara, a little confused at the exposure
of this unseemly appendage to her well-appointed
household, "I dare say you have not. He
never before made his appearance in the parlor when
any one was here. I suppose James was sent out by
my father. He was a servant of a family that we
knew well, and that left the town at the latest allowable
instant, in such haste as to leave this faithful
follower behind, who happened to be out of the way
at the moment. He was the most devoted creature,
but is a little unsettled in his intellects, in consequence
of a blow upon the head received in defending
his master from an attack from some street
ruffians late at night. My father found poor Peter
in great distress, and took him home out of humanity
to himself and friendship to his master. He has
been even stranger than usual since he has been
with us, in consequence of missing his old friends,
but we make him as comfortable as we can."</p>

<p>"I am sure that it is highly to your honor and
that of your father," said Hazlehurst, with feeling;
"but I see that it is about time for me to repair to
the mess-room, if I have any regard for my dinner.
But before I go," he continued, rising as he spoke,
"will you permit me to ask the honor of Miss Forrester's
hand at the assembly this evening?"</p>

<p>The lady smiled an assent, and the young officer
took his leave cheerily, and walked up the street
towards the Green Dragon with a much better
opinion of human nature in general, and of female

<!-- v2 page 184 -->

nature in particular, than he had entertained when
he walked down it.</p>

<p>On arriving at the mess-room, he found himself
very closely examined as to his experiences of the
night before, especially by those officers who had
been his predecessors in his quarters. He parried
their importunities, however, as adroitly as he could,
and kept his own counsel most religiously. He
slipped away as soon as he could after the cloth
was removed, and hastened home to dream over his
morning with the gentle Clara. He found every
thing in proper order, and John awaiting his commands.
On interrogation, that worthy asseverated
that he had stoutly denied that anything unusual
had happened. "He hoped he had not been an
officer's servant so long without knowing how to
tell a lie upon occasion."</p>

<p>"Very well, John," said the Captain, "I don't believe
the truth will suffer in your hands. So you
may now go where you please, only be here at six
o'clock to dress my hair."</p>

<p>John departed, and his master sat down to think
over the doings and sayings of the morning. He
could not but examine the portrait of the former
inhabitant of the apartment, and think of the strange
thoughts that must have haunted him while he sat
in that place; and at the picture of his lovely grandchild,
and compare her charms with those of her
lovely friend,&mdash;I need scarcely say to whose advantage.
The adventures of the preceding night troubled

<!-- v2 page 185 -->

him not; he was haunted by another and more dangerous
phantom in that solitary chamber.</p>

<p>At length he was aroused from his revery by a
knock at the door, which, when opened, revealed his
orderly-sergeant, whom he had directed to come to
him at that hour, with the best padlock he could find
in Boston, and all its appliances. The man had been
a blacksmith, and he soon affixed it with its staple to
the door of the room and departed.</p>

<p>"If the ghost come to-night, while I am gone,"
said Hazlehurst to himself, "he shall not come in at
the door if I can help it!"</p>

<p>When John had returned, and the toilet was
finished, Captain Hazlehurst proceeded to set forth
for Concert Hall, the yet surviving scene of many
a pre-revolutionary festivity. He dismissed John
with instructions to meet him at the Hall at twelve
o'clock. As he was leaving the room, his pocket
struck against the side of the door.</p>

<p>"There's no occasion for carrying my orderly-book
with me, that I know of," said he, carelessly, to himself,
and, as he spoke, threw it on the table in the
centre of the room. He then locked and double-locked
the door, and to make assurance doubly sure,
applied the padlock, and, with both keys in his
pocket, walked cheerily up the street to the scene
of action.</p>

<p>I wish I could indulge my dear readers with a
description of that brilliant assembly, but the inexorable
limits of my chapter (which I have already

<!-- v2 page 186 -->

overstepped) forbid. You would not have supposed
that the scene of that bright and gay festival was in
a besieged and straitened town. One of the finest
bands in the British service discoursed its sweetest
music to inspire the dance. The Hall was admirably
lighted, and decorated with flags and other loyal insignia.
The Governor, the General commanding the
troops, with their brilliant staffs, the officers of the
various regiments, comprising many of the younger
branches of the best families of England, the principal
civil functionaries, and the loyal gentlemen of
the town, all in the rich costume of the days when a
gentleman was known by his dress, were present.
And there, too, were the dashing wives of the married
officers, and the flower of the provincial beauty
that still remained loyal to its king. The appointments
of the supper, the plate-chests of the several
regimental messes being laid under contribution for
the purpose, were of the completest description, and
the table was covered with viands and wines which
showed that the sea was yet open to the beleaguered
army. All was joy and mirth. Every one seemed
determined to shake off whatever of despondency
the darkening prospects of the siege might urge upon
their hearts, and to be happy for at least one night.
Ah! What a glancing of scarlet coats and of gold
lace! What a rustling of damasks and brocades was
there! But of all the brilliant assemblage, I will
maintain it <i>&agrave; l'outrance</i>, there was none that surpassed
in beauty or in grace my Clara Forrester and

<!-- v2 page 187 -->

her Charles Hazlehurst. It was a blessing to see
them glide down the dance, and to look upon their
beaming eyes. Lord Percy shook his head, when
he saw how his young favorite had taken his advice,
and smiled inwardly as he watched them without
looking at them. But then it was no concern of his.
He had discharged his duty in putting Hazlehurst on
his guard. He must now take his own course, on his
own responsibility.</p>

<p>But such evenings (alas! that it should be so!) cannot
last forever. At a late hour the signal for breaking
up was given, and the party dispersed, "shut up
in measureless content." Hazlehurst handed Clara
into her carriage, and, I am afraid, found it necessary,
as it was a slippery night, to hold her hand rather
closely as he performed this duty. I recollect <i>I</i> used
sometimes to find it unavoidable. However, she drove
off, and Hazlehurst, followed by John, walked down
Hanover Street to his quarters. So absorbed was he
in his meditations upon the hours just fled, that he
thought of neither ghost nor goblin till he found himself
at the door of his room. Reminded by the sight
of his padlock of the reason of its employment, he
said, laughingly, "I flatter myself that I have been
rather more than a match for his ghostship to-night!
But we shall see."</p>

<p>With these words he unlocked his various fastenings,
and, followed by John, made his way into the
apartment. A few embers yet glimmered upon the
hearth, and John soon lighted the candles. Hazlehurst

<!-- v2 page 188 -->

cast his eyes around the room. Everything
was in its proper place and order. He chuckled
inwardly at the success of his plan, and rubbed his
hands with internal satisfaction. Everything was
right, no intruder had been there. He glanced at
the table in the centre of the room. He started
forward, and gazed upon it yet more earnestly. He
stood silent, and motionless with astonishment. BY
HEAVEN, THE ORDERLY-BOOK WAS GONE!</p>

<!-- v2 page 189 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>THE orderly-book was gone! Death and furies!
What was to be done now? The pranks of
the night before, though, like most practical jokes,
more amusing to their perpetrators than to their
victims, seemed to have been but the prologue to a
more serious jest,&mdash;one of those jests which are paradoxically
but truly called "no joke." As long as the
ghost was content to confine the overflowings of his
animal spirits to new combinations of the tables and
chairs, to a novel arrangement of the bed-clothes, or
to a summary divorce of the shovel and tongs, his
effervescences, if not absolutely agreeable, were at
least not positively mischievous. But to meddle
with what was none of his business, but, on the contrary,
with what was emphatically the business of
his Majesty's &mdash;th regiment, was an entirely different
affair. The ghost could not be a loyal ghost, that
was plainly to be seen. Old Honeywood, to be sure,
had no particular reason to love a government that
intended promoting him to the yard-arm, if it could
have laid hold of him; but it was not handsome in
him to resort to such a pitiful revenge as this, particularly
in his own house. It was hardly fair to visit
the sins of Queen Anne's Lords of the Admiralty upon

<!-- v2 page 190 -->

an unoffending captain and adjutant in the army of
King George.</p>

<p>It is plain that he was a rebel at his heart, and,
had he been in the flesh, would have waged war in
the name of the Colonies against his liege sovereign,
with as much <i>gusto</i> as he did against mankind in
general on his own account, especially if there happened
to be any rich London or Bristol ships within
range of his guns. He had a natural taste for such
pursuits: his only mistake lay in interfering as an
amateur in what was strictly a professional monopoly.
There is great virtue in a commission or letter-of-marque.
A piece of sheepskin and a pair of epaulets
make all the difference in the world in the
moral qualities of actions. In many cases it makes
all the difference between a hempen cord and a red
ribbon round a man's neck. Many a hero has gone
out of the world in the embrace of a halter, his achievements
only recorded in the Newgate Calendar, who,
had his noun substantive been only qualified by an
adjective or two, would have received "the Senate's
thanks," have glittered with medals and orders, and
been commemorated by world-famous historians and
poets. Such is luck! But it is none of my business
to moralize in this way. All I have to do is to relate
this true passage of history with the most absolute
accuracy of detail <i>Revenons &agrave; nos moutons</i>. Let us
to our muttons again.</p>

<p>While we have been indulging in these profitable
reflections, our hero has been through a variety of

<!-- v2 page 191 -->

evolutions. First he stood aghast, as if, instead of
gazing upon nothing at all, his sight had been blasted
by some particularly ill-favored apparition. This
was the only idea that his look and gesture communicated
to his trusty squire, who turned his eyes with
difficulty in the direction of his master's in the confident
expectation of being rewarded by the vision of
a raw-head and bloody-bones at the very least. Disappointed,
however, of any such pleasing spectacle,
he was by no means so ill informed in the very rudiments
of demonology, as not to know that it did not
necessarily follow, because he could discern nothing
beyond the common, that his master was equally
unfortunate.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir? Where is it, sir?" inquired John,
in a voice of hollow emotion.</p>

<p>"The orderly-book, you scoundrel! the orderly-book!"
responded the Captain, in a low, concentrated
tone.</p>

<p>"The orderly-book, your Honor!" returned John.
"Well, sir, I never heard of the ghost of a book
walking before! What does it look like, sir?"</p>

<p>It is evident that John was not a reading man (the
march of mind had not then been taken up, nor had
the schoolmaster gone abroad), or he would have
known that nothing is more common than for the
ghost of a book to walk. Indeed, what is a book but
the ghost of the man that writes it? Oh, blessed
necromancy of reading, mightier than that of the
Governor of Glubdubdrib, or the Island of Enchanters,

<!-- v2 page 192 -->

once visited by that only truthful traveller,
Lemuel Gulliver! For whereas his could only
command the departed for the space of twenty-four
hours, thine can summon them to the presence at all
seasons and for any time. But John did not know
this, and so he asked what the ghost of the orderly-book
looked like.</p>

<p>"Look like, you villain!" somewhat testily
answered Hazlehurst. "It looks like nothing at all.
It's gone, you dog!"</p>

<p>"Gone already, sir!" exclaimed the astonished
John. "And where was it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Exactly in the middle of the table there, with its
right cover leaning against the candlestick, its hinder
end cocked up upon the inkstand."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" shuddered John at this picturesque
description. "And how long ago is it since
your Honor saw it last?"</p>

<p>"Just as I was going to the assembly this evening,"
replied his master.</p>

<p>"Lord! is that all?" exclaimed the man, much
relieved. "I thought your Honor had just seen it,
when I could see nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Confound your nonsense!" returned the Captain
sharply. "I wish to God that I had seen it! What
under Heaven I am to say about it to Lord Percy
to-morrow, God knows! But light all the candles in
the room, and let us have a thorough search for it,
though it is not likely that it is here."</p>

<p>This foreboding was but too true. His prophetic

<!-- v2 page 193 -->

heart had told him an ower true tale. They looked
above, around, and underneath. They crawled over the
floor on their hands and knees, and, like the serpent
of old, "upon their belly did they go" under the
bed. They looked into every drawer, and inspected
the most impossible places. But it was all in vain.
The mystic volume was not to be found in the wood-box,
nor did it drop from the inverted jack-boots. The
window-seats were ignorant of its whereabouts, and
the window-curtains wotted not of its presence. The
cooking utensils knew not of it, and their basket and
their store was not blessed with its possession.
Where the devil could it be? It seemed as if the
devil only could tell.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any other disturbance in their
premises. This made the matter look the more mysterious.
It was a much more awful affair than if the
disappearance of the book had been accompanied by
any of the gambols and <i>funniments</i> of the night
before. That looked like fun: this looked like earnest.
The orderly-book contained information relating to
the strength and state of the royal forces, which it
was of the last importance should not fall into the
hands of the rebels. And beside this there were
loose papers, given to our hero by Lord Percy to be
copied, as he acted in some sort as his private secretary
as well as adjutant, which were of a still more
secret nature; such, for example, as his lordship's
reply to the requisition of the commander-in-chief for
the opinions of his principal officers as to the state

<!-- v2 page 194 -->

of affairs in the town, and the best course to be
pursued. This, and other documents, involved an
amount of intelligence as to facts and opinions,
which might be of infinite mischief if they fell into
the enemy's hands. Hazlehurst knew too well what
a mass of disaffection existed in the town, not to feel
that the worst was but too probable.</p>

<p>After every place, probable and improbable, had
been ransacked, and to no purpose, the search was
abandoned for the night. The room was secured as
far as locks and bolts were concerned, though they
seemed to be of but little moment in this chamber of
bedevilment, and Captain Hazlehurst retired moodily
to bed to seek for such rest as he could find. It was
an uncomfortable night, to be sure; not from any
renewal of the disturbances of the night before, for
all was quiet, but from his harassing thoughts and
internal vexation. His sleep was broken by visions
of his interview with his commander, in which he
should communicate this provoking occurrence.
Words of censure and reprimand rung in his ears.
He even saw himself, in the phantasmagoria of his
waking dreams, standing without his sword before a
court-martial detailed to try him for neglect of duty.
In the confusion of his thoughts he could not very
accurately determine what would be considered the
exact measure of his military offence; but he could
not help feeling that it would be no advantage to him
in his professional career, even in the most favorable
event. He cursed the evil hour in which he sought

<!-- v2 page 195 -->

these unlucky quarters, and heartily wished them,
and everything connected with them, at the devil.
He perplexed his thoughts in vain with conjectures
as to the motives and the method of the trick that
had been played him; and though he resolved not to
rest until he had plucked out the heart of the mystery,
still he feared that the injury to the service and to
his own prospects would be completed before he could
accomplish his purpose. It was a miserable business
altogether. If he escaped with a reprimand from
headquarters, and with the dread laugh of the
mess-table, he would be a lucky fellow.</p>

<p>I have often wondered how much the beaming
eyes and laughing mouth of Clara Forrester mingled
in these visions of the night. I am afraid that all
the little loves by whom he had been escorted down
Hanover Street, after he had put Miss Forrester into
the carriage, were sent to the right about by the first
tempest of his astonishment and vexation. But they
are volatile creatures, and, though easily brushed
aside for a moment, soon return again to the charge.
Like flies, it is easy enough to drive them away; but,
before you can congratulate yourself on being rid of
them, back they are again. There is one villain, for
example, that has been buzzing about me all the
time I have been writing, and evidently takes an intelligent
pleasure in tormenting me. "Get out, you
scoundrel!" There he stands on my paper, rubbing
his hands, and shaking his head, in perfect diabolic
glee at his success. Ben Jonson and the old dramatists

<!-- v2 page 196 -->

knew what they said when they called a familiar
spirit&mdash;a young devil, saving your presences&mdash;"a
fly." Just so the little loves come fluttering back
again after you think you have effectually scared
them away. But there the analogy ends; for although
they do mischief enough sometimes, still, like my
Lord Byron, "I cannot call them devils." They
played the devil with me, to be sure, a good many
times in my hot young days, but I don't believe they
meant any harm. At any rate, I should then have
been devilish sorry and still should be (but that is
between ourselves) to miss their gentle ministrations
altogether.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, I have the best reasons for
believing that they returned before daybreak, and
buzzed merrily about the pillow of Hazlehurst. The
mosquito-net is not yet invented that can keep them
out. I cannot depone positively to the exact proportion
of his waking or of his sleeping dreams that
was of their weaving; for I am scrupulous never to
state any fact in an historical document like the
present, which I am not prepared at any moment to
authenticate by affidavit before any magistrate or
justice of the peace. But I am quite certain that
those soft eyes and that bewitching smile floated
before his mind's eye, mixed up even with his least
pleasant anticipations. In case of the worst, youth
and nature would suggest that there might be some
comfort yet left him. Though his cup might be a
bitter one, still there was at least one cordial drop at

<!-- v2 page 197 -->

the bottom of it. Though censure or derision might
visit his misfortune, still there was one whose soft
bosom would feel with him, and who would view it
with the eyes of love, and not of discipline.</p>

<p>Perhaps the events of the day and evening had
encouraged this state of feeling; for, to be candid,
she had been tolerably encouraging. He felt more
sure that she loved him than he had ever done before;
and, although he could not exactly define his
own views and intentions in the premises, still he
yielded (and who can blame him?) to the delicious
dream of love. If any of my readers can recall to
recollection the time when he first truly believed that
he was beloved by a beautiful young woman, and
yet can find it in his heart to wonder that Hazlehurst
should have gilded the gloomy hours of that
unlucky night with dreams of Clara Forrester, I
wish he would just do me the favor to lay this true
history aside. He is not worthy to be my reader.
But then it is impossible that there should be such
a man.</p>

<p>The hours of the night wore on, and at last the
morning came. It was a black morning to poor
Hazlehurst; but he resolved to meet the unpleasant
consequences of his mishap with the best face he
could. As his candle-light toilet was proceeding, the
orderly-sergeant called for the book.</p>

<p>"I shall call myself upon Lord Percy, Williams,
immediately after parade: so you need not wait."</p>

<p>The veteran stared a little at this deviation from

<!-- v2 page 198 -->

routine; but it was his business to obey: so be bowed
and retired.</p>

<p>It was a bitter cold morning, and the keen wind
was improved in sharpness by the broad expanse of
frozen water which then separated the Common from
the country beyond; but Hazlehurst felt warm enough
in the prospect of what was before him. There is
no external or internal application of a more calorific
tendency than the inevitable necessity of doing a
particularly disagreeable piece of work at a certain
specified hour near at hand. It makes the heart
seethe like a caldron, and the boiling blood is sent
bubbling through the veins.</p>

<p>The parade was over: the troops were dismissed.
Hazlehurst was moving slowly towards the mess-breakfast,
thinking of the duty that must follow it,
when he was aroused from his revery by hearing a
horse reined up suddenly by his side. It was Lord
Percy himself.</p>

<p>"So Williams tells me, Hazlehurst, that you have
something to say to me. Come and breakfast with
me, my boy, and you will have the best of opportunities
to say it. I shall be quite alone."</p>

<p>"It will give me infinite pleasure, my lord," replied
Hazlehurst, "and I will be with you immediately."</p>

<p>"Right, right," said his lordship: "punctuality at
drills and at mess is a great military virtue. I shall
expect you in a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>With these words he cantered along the frozen road

<!-- v2 page 199 -->

(for it could hardly be called a street then) that led
to his excellent quarters.</p>

<p>I am afraid that my hero lied the least in the
world, when he said that it would give him infinite
pleasure to breakfast with his noble friend and
commander. Not that he had any fears as to the
quality of his breakfast or of his society; but the
thoughts of the sauce which he brought to both
plagued him in advance, and he wished that a longer
time and a wider space could have elapsed before it
was necessary to administer it. But delay was useless
and impossible: so he strode toward the quarters
of his host with a firm tread, and ascended the long
flight of steps that led to the house, and gazed upon
the trees and shrubs in the courtyard, all glittering
with ice, with as easy and careless an air as he could
assume.</p>

<p>The breakfast-room, into which he was shown, was
a spacious wainscoted apartment, with a low ceiling,
but an air of great comfort. A blazing fire of logs
roared up the chimney; and the breakfast-table, with
all its appliances of luxury, was drawn into a comfortable
proximity to it. The winter's sun looked
brilliantly through two windows of the room. Fresh
plants stood in the windows, and old pictures looked
down from the walls. It was not Alnwick Castle,
nor Sion House, to be sure; but it was a very inhabitable
place, for all that. An older campaigner than
his lordship might have thought himself well off in
worse quarters.</p>

<!-- v2 page 200 -->

<p>In a few minutes Lord Percy appeared,&mdash;having
exchanged his uniform coat for a brocaded dressing-gown,
and his military boots for Turkish slippers,&mdash;and,
after a cordial welcome to his young friend, rang
the bell for breakfast. The tray was brought; the
coffee was poured; the eggs were cracked; the toast
was crunched. The breakfast was despatched with the
appetites of young men sharpened by a daybreak
parade with the thermometer at zero. Their discussions
were confined to the good things before them
and the things to which they were naturally allied,
until the table was cleared and the servants withdrawn.
Then Lord Percy, drawing his chair up to
the fire, and comfortably nursing his left leg placed
over his right knee, turned to Hazlehurst with an air
of comic gravity.</p>

<p>"Well, my lad," thus his lordship opened the palaver,
"so you have somewhat to say to me? Faith I
thought as much last night!"</p>

<p>"Last night, my lord!" exclaimed the adjutant. "I
don't know that I rightly apprehend your meaning."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not," replied the Earl. "But you can
hardly suppose that I failed to observe how carefully
you followed my advice last evening. You must
not suppose that Cupid has bandaged all our eyes as
effectually as he seems to have done yours."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" replied our hero, "your lordship alludes
to my little flirtation with Miss Forrester. I
was only following your own advice, to fall in love
with two or three at the same time. But you know

<!-- v2 page 201 -->

my lord, that it is necessary to begin with one. Now
I begin with Miss Forrester."</p>

<p>"Bravo, bravo, Hazlehurst!" said Lord Percy, laughing.
"A ready answer is a good thing, in love or in
war. Well, well, you understand your own affairs
best, and are old enough to manage them for yourself.
Upon my honor, I can hardly blame you, young
man. I was half inclined to fall in love with her
myself last night. She is a fine creature."</p>

<p>"One does not often see a finer, indeed, my lord,"
answered the lover; "but you are quite at liberty to
enter the lists with me, if you choose," he doughtily
continued: "I have no pretensions to any monopoly
in that quarter."</p>

<p>I believe the fellow knew he lied when he said
that; but these, I believe, are the sort of lover's perjuries
at which Jove laughs. You will see this idea
illustrated and enforced in my folio on the subject,
now in the press. Whether Jove laughed at this or
not, Lord Percy did, as he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very likely, very likely. Thank you, thank you!
I do not know that I should like to run the risk,
were I not armed in proof on that side. Then I suppose
your business of this morning does not relate
to this matter, as I thought at first it might."</p>

<p>"No, my lord," answered Hazlehurst, plucking up
his courage, and determined to have it over at once&mdash;"no,
my lord. I am sorry to say that my errand
is of a much less pleasant character; and it relates
rather to war than to love, and to me than to Miss

<!-- v2 page 202 -->

Forrester. It is not the loss of my heart, but of your
orderly-book, that is in the question."</p>

<p>"The orderly-book lost, Hazlehurst!" exclaimed
Lord Percy. "What the devil do you mean?" in a
tone of the utmost surprise a little mixed with incredulity.</p>

<p>"Exactly what I say, my lord," replied the adjutant,
waxing cooler as he went on. "The orderly-book
and all its contents is gone; and what is worse I see
no sort of prospect of ever recovering it again."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? what do you mean?" repeated
the Earl in great astonishment. "You know very
well that this is a serious matter, and can hardly be
jesting."</p>

<p>"I was never more serious in my life, I assure you,
my lord," asseverated the young officer. "I wish it
may turn out to be a jest in the end. Sorry as I
should be to be guilty of any disrespect to your lordship,
I would willingly encounter your displeasure
for an untimely jest, so that the service were in no
danger of mischief from this unlucky business."</p>

<p>"But how could it be lost, Captain Hazlehurst?"
his lordship replied a little sternly. "How could it
be lost, when it was in your custody, and you could
not but know the vital importance of keeping it safe?
How came it lost, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am well aware, my lord," replied poor Hazlehurst,
"of the importance of this matter to his
Majesty's service, as well as to my own honor and
prospects&mdash;if I may mention them in the same breath.

<!-- v2 page 203 -->

I beg your lordship to listen patiently to the story I
have to tell you; and I beg that you will pardon the
apparent nonsense of the first part of my narration,
as you will see that it leads to a serious termination.
I presume I need bring no other evidence of the
truth of my statements before your lordship's tribunal
than my own assertion. The evidence of my servant
will be ready to corroborate them before less friendly
judges, should the matter end as seriously as I fear it
may."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to relate to his commander the
whole history of his two last nights, from the mysterious
footsteps to the vanishing of the orderly-book.
His lordship looked grave as the story proceeded, and,
rising, walked thoughtfully about the room after it
was finished. At length he thus addressed his young
friend, who sat in anxious expectation,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is a strange business, Hazlehurst, a very
strange business. I am afraid there is mischief in it.
At first I thought it might be a mystification of some
of your messmates: but they would hardly have ventured
upon such a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>."</p>

<p>"That is my own opinion, my lord. The pranks
of the night before were all fair, though a little rough
play. But I do not think that the <i>ennui</i> of a garrison
life, however much it may sharpen the wits of its
victims, would lead them to commit an action which
might injure the service, to say nothing of the character
of a brother-officer."</p>

<p>"That is true enough, Hazlehurst," resumed his

<!-- v2 page 204 -->

lordship. "I think it must be a contrivance of some
of the disguised rebels in this cursed town to assist
their rascally friends on the other side of the river.
My God! I would have sooner lost the best horse in
my stables than have had those papers fall into the
rebels' hands."</p>

<p>"I hope that your lordship does not look upon my
part in this unfortunate business as amounting to
culpable negligence, or neglect of duty," Hazlehurst
humbly ventured to suggest, seeing that his commanding
officer was in a milder mood than he had
apprehended he would be.</p>

<p>"Why, as to that matter, my friend," replied his
lordship, "you can hardly think, that sitting here with
you as my fellow-officer and companion, when off
duty, I can attribute any moral blame to you for
this accident. Whether you may not be regarded
as responsible in a military sense for the loss of this
valuable book, is a question I can express no opinion
about here and at this time, as I may have to form
one officially on the subject before long. The book
was properly in your custody: if it be not forthcoming
when regularly demanded, the question will
arise, <i>Why?</i> And it is not for me to decide now
whether the facts you have stated will be considered
sufficient to discharge your responsibility."</p>

<p>"Will your lordship have the goodness to advise
me what course to pursue under these circumstances&mdash;as
a friend, as one gentleman advising another in
a case of difficulty, and not as my superior officer?"</p>

<!-- v2 page 205 -->

<p>"Why, my dear fellow," returned the stout Earl,
sincerely feeling for his young favorite in his awkward
predicament, "the best advice I can give you is
to ferret out these rascals, and find the orderly-book
again before it is missed. When that fails, we will
see what can be done next."</p>

<p>"But how much grace have I to make search, even
if I could get a clew to the villany, before it must be
reported at headquarters?"</p>

<p>"I can give you only till next Saturday, when I
must make up my full weekly report to General Howe.
There is no need of saying anything about it before
then; and it gives you four whole days to work in,
as it is now only Tuesday morning. Leave no stone
unturned, my good fellow, to get at the bottom of this
affair. Much may be done in four days."</p>

<p>"I am heartily obliged to you, my lord," said Hazlehurst
gratefully, for he felt much relieved and comforted
by the kindness of Lord Percy's words and
manner, "and you may be sure that I will lose no
time in sifting this matter to the best of my abilities.
And you may be sure, also, that your lordship's
goodness and consideration for me will be gratefully
remembered by me as long as I live, whatever may
be the event of this affair."</p>

<p>"Keep up a good heart, my lad," returned the Earl
kindly, "and hope bravely for the best. You may
rely upon my doing all I can for you consistently
with my duty. And now you had better set about
your inquiries, as there is no time to be lost. And

<!-- v2 page 206 -->

when Williams comes to you, send him to me, and I
will have a new orderly-book ready for you before
evening parade."</p>

<p>With these words the heir of "the Percy's high-born
race" bowed his visitor out of the room. Hazlehurst
descended the steps with a lighter heart than
when he had ascended them, and he felt, what we
have all felt in our time, how much more unpleasant
the discharge of a disagreeable duty is in the anticipation
than in the actual performance. His actual
position was in no wise changed, and yet he felt as
if it were bettered. Such is the relief of the communication
of a secret sorrow, and such the magic of a
kind thought fitly clothed with words of kindness.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of one very excellent thing in
this world. There is at least one article which everybody
is ready to give away, though there are comparatively
few who are ready to accept it. I mean there
is a great deal of very good ADVICE floating about.
James Smith, I think it was, once suggested the formation
of "A Society for the Suppression of <i>ad</i>-Vice."
But I am sure I should not encourage such an institution.
Why, bless you! I don't know what my
neighbors would do if my issues of advice were
stopped or curtailed. The interest I take in their
affairs is worth much more to me than the ten per
cent I get for my money. I really don't think the
neighborhood could get along at all without my
advice. "It's unknown" what good I do, as were
the tears Mrs. Malaprop shed at the death of her poor

<!-- v2 page 207 -->

dear Mr. Malaprop. I consider the benevolent Howard
as a hard-hearted villain in comparison with me.
No, no! it will never do to suppress advice. The
difficulty in this branch of benevolence lies in finding
out how to apply the advice to practice. But that
is the concern of the party benefited. If he do not
know how to avail himself of your good advice, that
is no affair of yours. Dr. Johnson settled it long ago,
that no man should be expected to furnish ideas and
understanding at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, here was a case in point. Lord Percy had
given Captain Hazlehurst some very excellent advice:
the perplexity was to know what to do with it, now
he had got it. It was very easy for his lordship
to say, "Hazlehurst, ferret out these rascals, find
the orderly-book again;" but it was quite another
affair for the gallant Captain to reduce his instructions
to practice. However, he resolved to do his best;
and, as safety is said to be found in a multitude of
counsellors, he thought he might as well take some
more advice&mdash;on the hom&oelig;opathic principle adopted
by the philosopher of Islington for the recovery of
his eyes after they had been scratched out in his
celebrated leap into the quickset hedge. So he
thought he would take into his counsels some of his
trustiest comrades and especial cronies.</p>

<p>Calling at Captain Lyndsay's quarters, he was so
fortunate as to find him at home, and his Pylades,
Major Ferguson, with him. Dr. Holcombe was speedily
summoned to the council; and Hazlehurst soon

<!-- v2 page 208 -->

laid the matter, under strict injunctions of secrecy,
before them. It was a grave matter, requiring all
the aids that reflection or art could afford. Accordingly,
they lighted the calumet of consideration, and
sought for illumination in the circling clouds of smoke
that curled around their heads. In those days, dear
reader, cigars were not; but pipes daily reminded frail
mortals that they, too, were made of clay, and that
their lives were but as a vapor of smoke, that soon
vanisheth away.</p>

<p>But as suffumigation, though a powerful agent, did
not seem to be alone sufficient to summon the powers
most needed, the worthy surgeon, as one well skilled
in potent mixtures, brewed a smoking caldron, in
which he mingled many opposite ingredients, of
various kingdoms of nature [to make the mixture
"slab and good"]. When his incantations were
ended, the magic bowl was placed in the centre of
the circle, and was solemnly passed round from
mouth to mouth of those who sought from it wisdom
and inspiration. In those primitive days, the
heresy of ladles had not yet entered the pale of
orthodox good-fellowship. The genial mother-bowl
was not then split up into as many sects as there
were disciples. I beg to be distinctly understood
that I by no means sanction this concoction of the
"medicine-man," nor do I wish to imply that the
spirits thus summoned to their aid were the best
assistants in council or in action. I merely relate
the fact, and leave it for others to form their own

<!-- v2 page 209 -->

opinions about it. It is not my fault if they drank
punch, and smoked pipes, in the morning. But what
would posterity say to me, if I suppressed so important
a feature of this important consultation, from a
wish to whitewash their characters in the eyes of
this water-drinking generation?</p>

<p>"By Jove, Hazlehurst!" said Major Ferguson,
knocking the ashes out of his pipe, "this is the most
extraordinary ghost I ever heard of, and one that will
take a bishop, at least, to lay him."</p>

<p>"In default of a bishop," suggested Lyndsay, "here
is the Doctor, who as a university man, and one of a
learned profession renowned for making ghosts, must
serve us for want of a better man."</p>

<p>"This is the first time," said the Doctor, setting
down the bowl, from which he had been, in a most
unprofessional manner, engaged in swallowing his
own prescription&mdash;"this is the first time in my life
that I was ever taken for a conjurer. But, as Ferguson
justly remarks, as this is a case calling for the
piety of a bishop, I am certainly the only man in
company fit for the adventure."</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven you would undertake it, then,"
said Hazlehurst, who thought his friends rather inclined
to make light of a serious matter. "It may
be sport to you, but it is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not death to you, my dear fellow," interposed
the Doctor: "you are not so easily killed, as the d&mdash;d
Yankees knew, when they saw you running up Bunker's
Hill faster than they ran down it. Besides, you

<!-- v2 page 210 -->

should never mention death in the presence of a doctor.
You might as well talk of cabbage to a tailor.
It's professional, my dear fellow, it's professional."</p>

<p>"I wish, then," resumed Hazlehurst, "that you
would bring your professional artillery to bear upon
the villain who has stolen the orderly-book; and you
may call in the aid of your natural ally, too, if you
please."</p>

<p>"I should like to have the treatment of his case,"
said the Doctor thoughtfully. "I think that I could
manage it."</p>

<p>"And I should like to have the qualifying him for
your treatment, Doctor," said Lyndsay. "I am quite
sure that I could manage <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt," replied Holcombe. "Any
fool can break a head. It takes a wise man to mend
it again."</p>

<p>"And what," retorted Lyndsay, alluding to an
operation he would persist in considering as unnecessary,
in consequence of a knock over the head
at Lexington,&mdash;"and what if, in mending the hole,
he makes two?"</p>

<p>"He puts at rest forever," replied the Doctor
gravely, "the disputed question, whether or not the
party had any brains. There were not much, to be
sure; but it can never be denied again that there
were some."</p>

<p>"Truce to banter," said the graver Major Ferguson,
"and let us see what can be done to help poor Hazlehurst
out of this scrape."</p>

<!-- v2 page 211 -->

<p>"With all my heart," resumed the Doctor. "It seems
to me that the thing to be done is to set a trap for
the thief. But what the deuce shall we do for bait?&mdash;unless,
indeed, the commander-in-chief would lend
us his private papers for the purpose."</p>

<p>"He cannot be a vulgar thief," said Ferguson, "or
he certainly would not have left your tankard and
spoons behind him, Hazlehurst."</p>

<p>"Not only the plate," said Hazlehurst, "but my
watch and purse, lay full in his sight. So plunder
could not have been his object."</p>

<p>"He is an extraordinary fellow, certainly," said
the Doctor, "and we must as certainly contrive to
catch him, if it be only for the curiosity of the
thing. What is your plan, Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"I can suggest nothing better," said the Major,
"than to keep a strict watch for a few nights, both
within and without the building; for it seems to me
our only chance is to find him at his old tricks, or
prowling about the premises, as we have no idea of
where else to look for him."</p>

<p>"I can see no other plan that we can follow," said
Hazlehurst.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Lyndsay. "Can you, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"We can try it, at any rate," returned the leech.
"We shall probably have plenty of time, in the
intervals of his visitations, to devise other schemes.
I am ready for my share of the watch; that is, if
Hazlehurst's punch and tobacco are what they should
be."</p>

<!-- v2 page 212 -->

<p>"You need have no fears on that point," answered
Hazlehurst; "for John will brew you an Atlantic of
punch, and pile you up a Chimborazo of tobacco, when
he knows that you have entered into an alliance,
offensive and defensive, against the ghost."</p>

<p>"I am your man, then," cried the Doctor, finishing
the punch, "and I will bet you a supper at the Green
Dragon that I am the first man to see the ghost."</p>

<p>"Done!"</p>

<p>"Done!!"</p>

<p>"Done!!!"</p>

<p>And the session was adjourned.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>AFTER the conference at the quarters of Captain
Lyndsay was broken up, our hero walked deliberately
down Hanover Street toward his own abode.
He was busily planning operations in accordance
with the result of the council as he walked along.
But he was not so much absorbed by his own affairs
or his own meditations, as to be unconscious of his
approach to the habitation of his ladye-love. In
those days it was an essential part of good breeding
for a gentleman to call upon his partner on the morning
after a ball, "and humbly hope she caught no
cold," though he had to canter over half a county in
the service. It was not likely, therefore, that Hazlehurst
would pretermit the performance of this duty
when his path took him past her very door. So
he knocked boldly, and was speedily admitted, and
ushered into the presence of the fair Clara, who,
of course, was expecting his visit. She wore her
apple-green silk that morning,&mdash;a color I would not
recommend to my lady-readers, unless they are very
sure that their complexions can bear it,&mdash;and, by
Heaven! she did look divinely. It is provoking to
see how the most unbecoming colors will set off a
complexion and eyes that need take no thought for

<!-- v2 page 214 -->

themselves. But I am not going to rave. I only
state the simple truth in saying that she looked
divinely: at least, I never saw anything prettier
than the sweet glow of consciousness that mantled
over her cheeks and neck, and the smile that kindled
in her eyes, as she met the ardent gaze of her
advancing lover. At any rate, I am quite sure that
he agreed with me in this opinion; for he hardly
seemed to know whether he was in the body or out
of the body, as he walked up the room. Lovers
are foolish creatures&mdash;at least, so I have heard, for
I was never one myself. But for the life of me I
can't conceive why that silly Hazlehurst should have
gone and seated himself in the arm-chair on the
other side of the fireplace, when the gentle Clara
had taken pains to leave plenty of room for him
on the sofa by her side. I am sure I never should
have done that. However, he did, and it is my
business to relate, not to account for, the fact.</p>

<p>They were soon seated <i>vis &agrave; vis</i>, with nothing but
the little work-table between them, and there seemed
to be no reason why they should not make themselves
agreeable to one another. And I am by no means
sure that they did not, although they had very little
to say for themselves apparently. What Hazlehurst
might have whispered to Clara the night before, at
Concert Hall, as they stood apart, sheltered by a battalion
of card-playing dowagers, and covered by the
full burst of a regimental band, I am unable to say,
for I was at that time engaged in overhearing what

<!-- v2 page 215 -->

General Howe was saying to Governor Gage at the
other end of the room. But I think it must have been
something that altered their relations to each other
in some way, for they were not half as chatty and
conversable as they were the day before. And yet it
could not have amounted to a full understanding, or
that stupid Hazlehurst would not have been sitting
two yards away, looking at her pretty foot (not but
what it was well worth looking at) as it rested on
the edge of the footstool; nor would she have kept
her eyes fixed upon her embroidery all the time with
the prettiest confusion you ever saw. And I don't
believe that they would have talked over the night
before in a sort of way that made it perfectly plain
that they knew nothing at all of what they were
talking about, if they had felt quite at ease in their
own minds. It was clear that they were thinking of
something else than their words. Poor Hazlehurst
was evidently in the state of mind of an unlucky
moth that has been well advised by its wisers and
betters, that candles are dangerous things in general,
and especially that specific candle in particular, and
who yet cannot keep itself away from the shining
mischief. The attraction of the brilliant object before
him was quite too much for any dimly remembered
warnings of his distant family against American
beauties, or for the fresher hints of his friendly commander,
to keep him from flying at last into the flame.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how it was, my dear reader, but
somehow or other, in less time than I have been

<!-- v2 page 216 -->

writing these lines, Hazlehurst was by the side of
Clara, his left arm encircling her slender waist, their
right hands clinging together, and her sweet head
gently drooped upon his shoulder. It was a charming
group, I do assure you. There are many more
disagreeable situations in the world than that of
young Hazlehurst at that moment. It was a grand
pantomime of action. No words could have expressed
their meaning more eloquently. It was not
a time for words: they would have been impertinent
and superfluous. Accordingly, their lips gave
utterance to no sound. Whether their lips did any
thing else to the purpose, it is not my intention to
disclose. I am "trusty Mr. Tattle" as to all matters
which should be kept private. Nothing of
that sort was ever wormed out of me. The ladies
need have no hesitation in placing the most entire
confidence in my discretion.</p>

<p>But this silence, though deep and delicious, could
not last forever. Alas that it could not! Murmuring
words soon displaced it, and the faith of two
true young hearts was plighted to each other forever.
Ah, holy troth plight! Thine is the true marriage,
the era of the mystic union of souls, of which the
blessing of the priest is but the statement and proclamation.
Woe to those who profane its mysteries
by levity, by covetousness, or by falsehood!</p>

<p>As soon as their young joy had subsided into a
sort of tumultuous calmness, how they sat, with their
hands locked together, talking over their love and

<!-- v2 page 217 -->

their hopes! They traced with fond curiosity the
course of their true love&mdash;"Great Nature's Nile"&mdash;up
to its small beginnings and unsuspected springs.
Bruce himself could hardly have surpassed them in
zealous or minute investigation. And then the more
dubious future how were its uncertainties turned
into realities, and its doubts transmuted into sanguine
hopes, by the potent magic of youth and love!</p>

<p class="small">"Ah, love, young love! bound in thy rosy band,<br/>

Let sage or cynic prattle as he will,<br/>

These hours, and only these, redeem life's years of ill."</p>

<p>Clara's doubts as to her reception into the family
of her lover were eagerly driven away by his earnest
assurances of a cordial welcome. Sir Ralph and his
mother were the best of human beings, and had no
earthly wish beyond his happiness; and was not his
happiness wrapped up in her? Such is the logic
of youth and love, and it easily prevailed over one
willing enough to be convinced. The best of human
beings sometimes take very different views of the
component elements of earthly happiness from their
children: at least, so it is said. They were too happy
to fear. The future would take care of itself. The
present was enough for them.</p>

<p>But such interviews, though they live forever,
must come to an end in time and space. The time
came when the plighted lovers were to part for the
first time since they had exchanged their sacred
vows. Dinner-time will come round on the day of
rejoicing and on the day of mourning, and interpose

<!-- v2 page 218 -->

its material demands between our souls and soft
emotions of tenderness and grief. The necessities
of the body often afford a healthful distraction to
thoughts too highly strung to sensations of joy or
of sorrow. The body is a "homely nurse;" but it is
a faithful one, if it be not maltreated, and does its
best to guard and help the immortal child that is
intrusted to it to be carried in its arms during its
days of infancy. So the time of parting came, and
they parted; not for any interminable space of time,
to be sure, but it was their first parting. It was
not, as I just said, an eternal separation, for there
was to be a great sleighing-party that evening, and
Hazlehurst had already engaged Clara to be his
companion. With as many last words as if they
were to part for years, he at length departed, with
quite unnecessary entreaties to her not to forget the
evening's engagement.</p>

<p>It was all over. The irreparable step was taken.
The Rubicon of life was passed. The hour that was
just expired would tinge with its hues every future
moment of his life. He felt that it was no light thing
that he had just done, and, though he was conscious
of a deep happiness, it was no boisterous joy, and
it was not only with ease, but with satisfaction,
restrained within the limits of his own breast, until
the due time of disclosure. It was a pleasure to feel
that he had a secret hoard of happiness, known only
to himself, which he might count over with a miser's
joy, but with none of a miser's guilt or folly.</p>

<!-- v2 page 219 -->

<p>One thing, however, was remarkable. The idea
of the orderly-book, or of the ghost, had never once
crossed his mind after he had found himself hurried
on to the catastrophe of the interview. He was sorry
that he had not made Clara the confidante of his
troubles, and resolved to repair the omission at the
first opportunity. Confidence should not be kept
back first on his side. He rather rejoiced that he
had a misfortune which she might share with him.
Perhaps his philosophy would not have stood him
in such good stead, had his misfortune been a little
greater than it was. But everything helps to feed
a healthy love. It is your feeble, rickety brats,
that expire of the first unsavory mess of earthly
pottage.</p>

<p>The mess-dinner was over. There had been some
quizzing on the subject of Miss Forrester and of the
ghost; but it was all evidently at random, and they
had no idea how very near the wind they were going
on either tack. Hazlehurst and his friends kept their
own counsel, and after dinner met by appointment
at Dr. Holcombe's quarters to finish the plan of their
campaign against the midnight forager of orderly-books.
They had, as they had agreed upon, selected
a number of picked men, on whose secrecy and fidelity
they could rely, who were to keep watch and
ward, duly relieved, by night and day, without making
any noise about it; so that if the ghost should
return, clothed in his "vesture of decay," to the
scene of his former operations, he would be pretty

<!-- v2 page 220 -->

sure to be laid by the heels. The officers themselves
also agreed to mount guard, by turns, in the Captain's
chamber, so that it should never be without a sleepless
eye on the lookout. Arrangements were made
that the sentinels and their officers should rendezvous
quietly in the neighborhood, at a small inn, as if by
accident, and the men be shown their posts of observation
without any bustle to attract notice; John and
Orderly Williams being left in garrison of the haunted
building until it was properly invested. Everything
happened at the time and in the order that it should,
and the arrangements were carried into effect with
military precision. One man walked up and down
the street, with injunctions never to lose sight of the
front of the house. The three other sides were in
charge of three other trusty men, so placed that no
approach could be made to the house on either side
without instant detection. A guard was also placed
on each floor of the house on the inside, although
it had been most thoroughly searched, in advance,
in every corner. It seemed as if the Prince of the
Power of the Air alone, approaching through his own
peculiar principality, could obtain entrance unobserved.
And so they rested on their arms.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the winter's sun made haste to
put an end to the short day, and the time arrived for
the great sleighing-party to rendezvous in the North
Square. Captain Hazlehurst's graceful little sleigh,
contrasting curiously with his stout cob, was at the
door, and he was speedily drawn up in front of Mr.

<!-- v2 page 221 -->

Forrester's mansion, awaiting the pleasure of its fair
mistress. She soon appeared, breathing a fresh summer
upon the cheek of winter, and yet looking like
his youngest daughter, so befurred and betippeted,
and becloaked was she. Still, through all, you could
see the graceful outline of her shape, while her happy
face glowed through her world of habiliments, like
the sun through evening clouds. The moon would
perhaps be a more appropriate, but the sun is a more
splendid, simile: so let it stand. She was soon by the
side of Hazlehurst, and they were rapidly careering
away toward the North Square. A very few minutes
brought them to the rendezvous, where they found
a large company of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the garrison and the
townspeople, preparing for a merry scamper round
the town. There were large sleighs drawn by two,
and some by four, horses, containing parties, which
like the family party of the Vicar of Wakefield, if
they did not have a great deal of wit, they had a great
deal of laughing, which answered the purpose just as
well. There were not wanting modest single sleighs,
like that conveying our hero and heroine, which, if
not as well adapted for frolic as their larger companions,
were better calculated for sentiment and for
flirtation. After the usual time had been wasted in
waiting for loiterers, and adjusting where everyone
should go, the procession set forward in due order;
the <i>quadrig&aelig;</i> taking the lead, and the more unpretending
vehicles following in due succession.</p>

<p>Aha! what a merry jingling of bells, and ringing of

<!-- v2 page 222 -->

laughter, resounded through the streets of Boston as
the horses dashed through them, making the frozen
earth resound with their tread! It was a sound of
merriment that jarred gratingly upon the ears of
many an unwilling listener, separated by the siege
from beloved hearts, and suffering, perhaps, from cold
in the depth of that dreadful winter, or with hunger,
within the sound of the revelry of their oppressors.
To many an ear the sweet bells seemed "jangled, out
of tune, and harsh." But what was that to the revellers?
What cared they for the pining of rebel hearts?
Away, away! Up Hanover Street, down Queen
Street, through the succession of streets now all amalgamated
into Washington Street, up to the lines on the
Neck! How the crackling snow glitters in the light
of the full moon! What a volcanic effect do the rebel
watchfires give to the lovely hills in the distance!
You can hear the very hum of the camp, so near are
you to it; and you have the pleasing uncertainty as
to how soon a battery of cannon may open upon you,
or a shell be sent to convey to you the compliments
of those who are knocking at your gates. But what
of that? Away, away! Back again to the Common,
round it, and then dash down to the line of
wharves that enclose the harbor, look out over the
frozen sea, and then round again across those desolate
fields which are now all populous streets or crowded
marts. Oh, it was a merry drive! What though
the hardships of a seven-years' war, ghastly wounds,
and grizzly death, awaited some of the revellers, and

<!-- v2 page 223 -->

the bitterness of disappointed hope and of interminable
exile was the appointed lot of others? They
knew it not. That glittering night was theirs&mdash;and
who has more?</p>

<p>There are worse places for a flirtation or a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
let me tell you, than a sleighing-party, especially
where you have a sleigh to yourselves, the noise and
the bustle isolates you so completely. And then
the bear-skins roll you up together so comically,
that positively you sometimes mistake your neighbor's
hand for your own. It's very odd, but so it is.
Poets may talk as much as they please about summer
moons; but I have known quite as much mischief
done under winter moons. And, if I had a daughter,
I would quite as soon trust her with a "detrimental"
in a summer grove, beside a murmuring stream, with
the very best moon that was ever manufactured hanging
over their heads, as I would in a snug sleigh,
behind a good horse, making good time over a ringing
road, in a cold, clear, sparkling night.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Now, ponder well, ye parents dear,"</p>

</div>

<p>and lay these, my words of wisdom, to heart.</p>

<p>Clara and Hazlehurst, you may be sure, did not fail
to improve their opportunities; and the evening's
drive furnished a very satisfactory epilogue to the
morning's drama. After a brief interval of silence, as
they rushed up King Street, Clara turned to Hazlehurst,
and said laughingly to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Charles, you have not told me yet what
Captain Honeywood had to say to you; for, of course,

<!-- v2 page 224 -->

he must have been to call on his tenant by this
time."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Clara, I am satisfied that he was
a piratical old dog. I have but too good reason to
think ill of him."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And how so, pray? Has he laid you
under contribution already? Perhaps he intends collecting
his rent in advance."</p>

<p>"If that were all," answered Charles, "I should
care little about it. But I am afraid that the old villain
is more of a rebel than a pirate. I fear he bears
more of a grudge against the King than against me."</p>

<p>"That is natural enough, you know," replied Clara,
"for it was his Majesty's predecessor who put him
to so much inconvenience for his little mistakes in
the matter of ownership. But you mean something,
Charles&mdash;now tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"The all is soon told," said he. "The crafty old
sea-dog has helped himself to the very thing that it is
most important, for the sake of the service and for
my own sake, should have been kept out of his hands&mdash;and
I suppose I may have to pay for his villany."</p>

<p>"Good God, Charles!" exclaimed Clara, turning
pale with affright. "What <i>do</i> you mean? What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my love," he responded, "excepting that
he has carried off the orderly-book of the regiment,
which may convey intelligence to the rebels that will
bring them buzzing about our ears, if they have the
sense to make use of it."</p>

<!-- v2 page 225 -->

<p>"But you&mdash;how will it affect <i>you?</i>" inquired
Clara, evidently thinking more of her lover than of
her liege lord. "You said that it was bad for your
own sake that this book had fallen into his hands."</p>

<p>"Indeed I hardly know myself exactly," he answered;
"but I am quite certain that it can do me
no good. And what a court-martial may think of it,
they only can tell."</p>

<p>"A court-martial!" exclaimed Clara in consternation.
"Dear Charles, what have you done for which
you can be court-martialed? Pray tell me that you
are only in jest."</p>

<p>"I wish I were in jest, my dearest Clara," said he
in reply; "but it is no joke, I assure you. The orderly-book
was in my custody, as the adjutant of the
regiment. I left it on my table when I went to the
assembly last night, and when I came back it was
gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" repeated Clara, echoing his words.</p>

<p>"Gone, my dear," he repeated. "And how or
whither, the thief, and the devil that helped him,
only knows. And when the loss is reported at head-quarters,
I have reason to fear that I shall be held
responsible for it, and it may prove a serious business."</p>

<p>"But what can they do to you, dearest Charles?"
almost gasped poor Clara. "It certainly was not
your fault that it was taken."</p>

<p>"I cannot think it was," he answered, "after all
the precautions I had taken. But one cannot tell

<!-- v2 page 226 -->

what views these old fellows may take. If it come
to a court-martial, a reprimand would be the least
punishment, the loss of the adjutancy, I think, would
be the greatest. But the worst is the effect it will
be likely to have upon my promotion."</p>

<p>"This is dreadful, dreadful!" sobbed poor Clara,
bursting into tears. "O Charles, Charles! what is
to be done?"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Clara," answered Hazlehurst, brushing
away her tears in a manner for which I can only
account on the supposition that she could not get at
her pocket-handkerchief, and from the fact that they
had dropped into the rear of the procession, "do not
be distressed about it, my love. I and my friends are
resolved to find out what this business means, and, if
we can get to the bottom of it by Saturday, all will
be well, and, if not, the worst can be borne."</p>

<p>"By Saturday!" said Clara, clearing up a little:
"that is a good while to come, and much may happen
before then. I wish that I could do something to
help yon. Can I not?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my love, but your good wishes and sympathy,
I believe," said Hazlehurst "But stay, there
is a thing that you can do. You can ask your father
to let our poor fellows have the shelter of his summer-house,
which commands the rear of the Vaughan
house. It will be a serious service to them these bitter
nights."</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Clara cheerfully, "you can
have the key to the little gate that opens upon your

<!-- v2 page 227 -->

grounds,&mdash;that was made for the accommodation of
Miss Vaughan and myself,&mdash;and, as the fence is an
open one, they can keep watch as well in the summer-house
as in the yard."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he replied: "that will be doing us
good service. I hope," he continued after a short
pause, "that you will pardon me for not telling you
all this this morning. But in truth I never thought
of it once. It was hardly fair, as you did not have
all the facts of my case before you. But it is not too
late, you know, now to change your mind."</p>

<p>"You do not think that this, or anything else that
you <i>could</i> do, would make any difference in my love
for you, Charles?" said Clara, looking up in his face.
"I know you do not."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do not, dearest," he replied, and as he
spoke he leaned his lips so near her cheek, that I
should have thought that they must have touched,
had I not known that it would have been improper.</p>

<p>"But here we are at the Royal Tavern," he exclaimed,
as they drove into Dock Square, and drew
up at the door of the inn, where it was proposed to
close their expedition. "Now clear your brow, and
repair your eyes, lest the gossips put things, and people
too, together."</p>

<p>There is a time of life when three days seem to be
an all-sufficient eternity, and my Clara was happily
not past that blessed period. So she soon dismissed
the unpleasant tidings she had just heard from her
mind, and endeavored to mingle in the gayeties of

<!-- v2 page 228 -->

the Royal Tavern. The scene was not a very magnificent
one, to be sure; but the company was as gay
as if it had been a royal palace. The mulled wine
was beyond praise. The floor of the large parlor was
swept, and a noble fire diffused light and heat through
the room. They had not a regimental band, as they
had the night before; but the fiddle of a musical negro
belonging to the house was sufficient to set them all
dancing and flirting. And what could his Majesty's
own band itself do more? At a proper time an
excellent supper was served in the dining-room,&mdash;none
of your perpendicular abominations, but a good,
regular, sit-down supper, all hot from the spit, and
served, if not with metropolitan magnificence, yet at
least with provincial plenty. Ample justice was done
to the viands; and the port wine and the everlasting
punch were not neglected. After the sacred rage of
hunger was appeased, the company returned to the
great parlor, and resumed their gayeties, which were
protracted until a late hour. Such were some of the
schemes to which the beleaguered inhabitants of the
town resorted to speed away some of their weary
hours. And very good schemes, they were, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>I do not know how it was, but the garrison gossips,
of whom Hazlehurst had warned Clara, remarked that
he was not as devoted to her as usual. From this
they augured, with the sagacity of their tribe, that
he was inclined to be off from the flirtation. Now
<i>I</i> formed a directly opposite opinion from the circumstance.

<!-- v2 page 229 -->

I am too old a bird to be <i>chaffed</i> in that way.
I know, however, that the young lovers compared
notes of what they heard and overheard on the subject,
as they drove home, and that they were entirely
satisfied with the success of the evening. What
could have made them dissatisfied with it?</p>

<p>On arriving at his quarters, Hazlehurst found every
thing ready, but no ghost as yet. Dr. Holcombe,
who much preferred a comfortable arm-chair, a pipe,
and a tankard of punch, over against a rousing fire,
to all the sleighing-parties that ever manufactured
pleasure out of cold and discomfort, had volunteered
to mount guard for the first evening in Hazlehurst's
room. He protested, however, that all had been
quiet, and not so much of a ghost stirring as would
make the candles burn blue. He and Hazlehurst sat
up till near morning, and then lay down alternately
for an hour or two&mdash;but all was still. "Not a mouse
stirring." They had their labor for their pains that
night. Still they were not discouraged in their campaign
against the powers of darkness by this withdrawal
of the enemy. They still believed that they
would have a brush with him yet. In this faith they
renewed their arrangements for the next day, carefully
managing them so cautiously that there should
be no ground of suspicion given to the world around
that there was anything extraordinary going on.</p>

<p>The allies met after breakfast to talk over the
matter, and to decide whose turn should be the next
to face the enemy. Major Ferguson, in right of seniority

<!-- v2 page 230 -->

of rank, received the privilege. The men who
were on guard during the night were examined; but
they maintained that there was nothing that could be
construed into a suspicious circumstance that had
fallen under their observation. Renewed charges of
secrecy were given and exchanged, not only for fear
of the ghost's getting wind of the conspiracy against
him, but lest the laugh at the mess-table might be
turned against them. Lord Percy was curious to
hear the result of the night's campaign, when the
adjutant waited upon him for orders, and gave his
approval of the steps taken, and encouraged them to
proceed.</p>

<p>Another day, and yet another, passed away. Ferguson
and Lyndsay had successively taken the field
against the ghost; but none would come when they
did call for him. Old Jamaica was the only spirit
that was raised, and tobacco-smoke was the only intangible
essence that infested them. What was to be
done now? It was plain that the ghost was more
than a match for them. They believed that they
might be his masters in the field; but he certainly
had the advantage of them in the strategy which
avoids the presence of a superior enemy. They felt,
in the slightest degree in the world, like fools, that
they should have lost their natural rest for three
nights, and expended a degree of skill and energy
sufficient to have raised the siege, and all for nothing.
Friday night was come. The morrow was the fatal
Saturday, when the orderly-book must be found, or

<!-- v2 page 231 -->

the loss reported at headquarters. The confederates
sat rather gloomily over their wine at Ferguson's
lodgings,&mdash;for Ferguson was a married man, and did
not live at mess, and considered with themselves
what was to be done next.</p>

<p>"You have not won your supper at the Dragon
yet, Doctor," said Ferguson. "The ghost does not
seem to regard you with any more favor than the rest
of us."</p>

<p>"The Ides of March are not past yet, my friend,"
observed the Doctor. "I shall have a double chance,
as I shall keep watch the last night of the siege, as
well as the first. You cannot tell what this night
may bring forth."</p>

<p>"So you are not discouraged, I am glad to find,"
said Hazlehurst, "and still hold to your intention for
the night. But don't you intend to go to Miss Forrester's
this evening? I know you are invited, and
your watch can begin after the party ends."</p>

<p>"Not I, indeed," responded the son of Galen,
"not I, indeed! I am not quite boy enough for that.
It is all well enough for you youngsters, who have
no turn for rational pursuits; but a pipe and a tankard
for me, against all the gatherings together of flirting
boys and girls, and gambling papas and mammas,
that were ever held. I shall repair to my post early
in the evening, and maintain it unseduced and unterrified."</p>

<p>"And faith! I believe that I will bear you company,
Doctor," said Ferguson. "My wife has not

<!-- v2 page 232 -->

got over the cold she got at that cursed sleighing-party,
and intends going to bed, instead of the party."</p>

<p>"Do so, by all means," replied Holcombe, "and I
dare say, that, besides having a rational time together,
we shall have a good account to give of the ghost
by the time these boys are ready to come home.
Only, I suppose, if we see the ghost both at the same
time, you will expect to go snacks in the supper?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, I shall," said the Major, laughing.
"We will be partners in the battle and in the
spoils."</p>

<p>The party soon after dispersed, and went their
several ways; and it will not surprise my readers
to learn that Hazlehurst's way led him to Clara Forrester's.
He just looked in to see if he could be of
any service. He found the fair Clara in some little
perturbation.</p>

<p>"What goes wrong, my love?" he inquired.
"Has the Governor sent an excuse, or has <i>la belle</i>
Wilton turned sulky, and refused to come?"</p>

<p>"Worse than either, I assure you, Charles," she
replied. "I could spare a dozen governors and beauties
better than black Domingo, who has selected
this particular occasion to fall sick, and to throw me
back on the mercies of James, who is hardly equal,
as you know, to such an emergency."</p>

<p>"That is unlucky, indeed," said Hazlehurst. "But
my John is quite at your service, such as he is; and
he is certainly competent to the ministerial, if not to
the legislative, duties of such an occasion."</p>

<!-- v2 page 233 -->

<p>"Thank you!" she answered. "He will be of great
use, and I gladly accept your offer. But what will
the Doctor and Major Ferguson do, without him to
attend them, since you say that they are determined
not to smile upon me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear for them!" replied Hazlehurst.
"John shall brew them a double supply of punch,
and leave their supper ready laid for them, and they
can wait upon themselves fast enough: they are too
old campaigners to be disconcerted by a trifle."</p>

<p>"They shall be better treated than they deserve,
then, for not coming to me," said she; "for I will
send poor old Peter over to them with their supper,
and with a bowl of the punch I have been superintending
myself for the evening. So you will be
good enough to let me have John as soon as you can
spare him."</p>

<p>"He shall be at your command directly," he replied,&mdash;"as
soon as he can put himself in proper trim.
Peter will answer all the purpose for the Doctor and
Ferguson."</p>

<p>After a few more passages between the lovers,
which I do not think particularly concern my readers,
Hazlehurst took his leave of his ladye-love, and
proceeded to his quarters. I beg that no unkind
imputations may be laid upon my Clara in consequence
of her holding this festivity on the eve of the
important Saturday; for the arrangements had been
made for it before she knew anything of Hazlehurst's
troubles. And as they were still a secret, and as she

<!-- v2 page 234 -->

had as yet no acknowledged interest in them, if they
were public, there was obviously nothing to be done
but to go on. But the dear girl had suffered great
distress and anxiety about it, especially as the week
drew to an end without any tidings of the missing
volume. But she had to put a good face upon the
matter, and go through her hospitable duties with the
best grace she could.</p>

<p>In those days the hour for the assembling of company
was a very different one from that which now
brings a party together. Before seven o'clock the
rooms were filled. I cannot stop now to describe
(though description is my <i>forte</i>) the beauty and
splendor of the scene. We have nothing in these
days, excepting the awkward imitation of a fancy
ball, that approaches the glories of the days of brocades
and scarlet coats, of gold lace and gold buttons,
of diamond buckles, and steel-hilted rapiers that
looked like diamonds, of powder, and high-heeled
shoes. Ah! those were the good times, when you
knew a gentleman by his coat, and were not obliged
to cipher him out by his conduct or his conversation.</p>

<p>The company were received by Mr. and Miss
Forrester, with all the ceremony of the old time.
I have not introduced Mr. Forrester to the reader
as yet, simply for the want of time. As he made no
objection to Hazlehurst's proposals, when they were
laid before him, only declining to ratify the engagement
formally until the consent of Sir Ralph had
been received, and as I, therefore, could make no use

<!-- v2 page 235 -->

of him in the only way fathers can be successfully
managed,&mdash;as cruel tyrants trampling on the young
affections of their daughters,&mdash;I have had no occasion
to mention him. He would have been well
worth your knowledge, however, as a favorable specimen
of the old pre-revolutionary New England gentleman.
But I have no time left for you to cultivate
his acquaintance. The fact is I want three volumes
to make use of my materials. Maga is very good;
but, like Chanticleer in the fable, "she is not
enough." All that was eminent in rank or station
(civil or military), all that was brilliant in beauty, and
attractive in manners, that the besieged town could
command, was gathered together on that gay evening.
Youth and folly, old age and cards, were in happy
proximity. And whatever there might be of <i>love</i>
about the former conjunction, there was certainly
nothing of it in the latter. Mrs. Battle herself never
despised playing cards for <i>love</i> more heartily than the
former generation of Boston dowagers. Gaming was
in those days almost as much a necessity of life as
drinking. At the proper time, when supper was
announced, his Excellency led the procession, bearing
aloft the fair hand of his lovely hostess, and not tucking
it under his arm like a walking-stick or a wet
umbrella. The tables were loaded with the choicest
viands and the rarest wines, "and all went merry as
a marriage-bell."</p>

<p>While these festive proceedings were going on in
the next house, Dr. Holcombe and Major Ferguson

<!-- v2 page 236 -->

were whiling away the hours as best they might,
in such talk as the garrison and the mess afforded.
The punch-tankard stood between them upon a little
table, and filled up many pauses in their conversation.
As they lazily puffed out the smoke from their
mouths, they thought with satisfaction of the wisdom
of their choice. The distant hum of the party, and
the music, only enhanced their solitary satisfaction.
At length, a tap was heard at the door, which, opening,
admitted the sable form of poor Peter, to whom
we introduced our reader in the second chapter. He
entered the room with a dogged and almost an unconscious
air of stupidity, bearing a basket in either
hand, from one of which he produced some elegant
extracts from the great supper, and from the other a
fresh flagon of the most delicious punch that they
had ever dreamed of, and, besides, two bottles of the
celebrated old Forrester Madeira, which had "put a
girdle round the earth" in its travels, and knew more
years than I dare mention.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say, that as soon as Peter
had disposed of these edibles and potables upon the
table, and retired, the friends drew up to it, and
commenced an assault upon its contents which did
infinite honor to their military education. The flagon
was in constant requisition, and was pronounced nectar
worthy of the Hebe who had dispensed it. Then,
after their supper was finished, they uncorked the
wine, and, drawing up to the fire, set in for serious
drinking. They were seasoned vessels; but I am

<!-- v2 page 237 -->

sorry to say, that in due time the liquor began to
make inroads upon their brains, and to set their
tongues in perpetual motion. They told excellent
stories, only forgetting the point; but this, as they
both talked at once, was of the less consequence.
The Doctor grew professional, and the Major musical.
The one described operations, and the other broke
down in the midst of songs, all of which he sung to
the tune of "Water parted from the Sea." Their eyes
began to glaze, and their tongues to trip. They were
not at all surprised at seeing duplicates of all the
objects in the room, nor at finding themselves stopping
short in the midst of stammering sentences. In short,
I grieve to relate it, they were getting very drunk.</p>

<p>"I say, Doctor," stammered the Major, "won't you
take another glass&mdash;of&mdash;ghost?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n the&mdash;ghost!" hiccoughed the Doctor. "I
do be-believe, Ferguson, you're dr-drunk! I should
like to see the gh-ghost that would face me n-now."</p>

<p>"Suppose&mdash;you&mdash;see, Doctor&mdash;whether the
door's&mdash;drunk!" said the Major. "It looks d&mdash;d
tottering to me."</p>

<p>The Doctor laid his course for the door, and, after a
few judicious tacks, succeeded in making it. It was
slightly ajar: so he shut and locked it, apostrophizing
the ghost as he meandered back to his chair.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you! You'll have to c-come through the
k-keyhole, to-night, m-my friend&mdash;if you c-come at
all."</p>

<p>Having with great generalship recovered his seat,

<!-- v2 page 238 -->

they attempted to resume their "rational enjoyment"
and improving conversation. But nature was too
strong for them, and it was not many minutes before
they were both fast asleep in their chairs. I am sorry
to say that such scenes were not so rare, or so discreditable,
in those three-bottle days, as they have
happily since become; and the sight of two middle-aged
gentlemen drunk on either side of a fireplace
would have been no astonishing sight seventy years
ago.</p>

<p>How long it was after this point of their adventures,
I cannot exactly tell, but it was not long,
before the men who were keeping guard were alarmed
by a loud and most startling noise in the haunted
chamber. They all incontinently rushed to the door,
and heard within the sounds of a clamorous struggle.
The ghost was evidently caught at last. But it was
also plain that he was fighting for his life. He was
game to the last, clearly. He was apparently almost
a match for his two adversaries; for loud cries resounded
through the house.</p>

<p>"Here he is, d&mdash;n him!" "I've got him!" "By &mdash;&mdash;,
he's choking me!" "Murder, murder!"
"Help, help!" "Where are you, you scoundrels?"
All attended by a running accompaniment of furniture-breaking
and chairs tumbling into chaotic heaps.
The men tried in vain to open the door, when
Hazlehurst rushed up stairs in hot haste, having
been summoned, by his own direction, at the first
alarm.</p>

<!-- v2 page 239 -->

<p>"Where are your muskets, men?" he cried in
strong excitement. "The bloody rebels are murdering
them! Dash open the door with the butt-ends!"</p>

<p>Seizing a musket, he suited the action to the word,
and the door was soon broken down, though not
without difficulty, as doors were then. The scene
was frightful. The furniture was overturned; the
lights were out; and lying on the floor, either mortally
wounded, or exhausted by a fruitless struggle,
lay the watchmen of the night.</p>

<p>"Where is the villain?" cried Hazlehurst, rushing
into the room.</p>

<p>"Here's the d&mdash;d scoundrel!" cried the Doctor,
laying hold of the Major.</p>

<p>"This is the infernal rascal!" bellowed the Major,
seizing the unhappy Holcombe by the throat.</p>

<p>And, as they shook each other, they vainly endeavored
to rise from among the wreck of things that
surrounded them.</p>

<p>It needed no conjuror to tell how the matter stood.
Hazlehurst sunk into a chair, which, fortunately, had
survived the fray, and made the whole house ring
with interminable peals of laughter. His followers
could not resist the contagion, which was made the
more irresistible by the drunken gravity of the two
heroes, who sat like so many tipsy Mariuses amid
the ruins of another Carthage. You would have
thought that a legion of laughing imps had taken
possession of the mansion, and were consecrating it
to their service.</p>

<!-- v2 page 240 -->

<p>As soon as Hazlehurst could command his voice,
he gave directions to the men to separate the unlucky
ghost-seers, and to carry them carefully to bed. Then,
taking a candle, he surveyed the prospect before him.
The emptied flagons and broken bottles sufficiently
accounted for the scene he had just witnessed. He
glanced his eye upon the table. His color changed.
He started forward. By Heaven! THERE LAY THE
ORDERLY-BOOK!</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Two or three years had passed away, and a happy
family party were assembled around a Christmas fire
at Hazlewood, the seat of the Hazlehursts. Vigorous
age and blooming infancy clustered around the hearth:
in the centre of the circle were Charles Hazlehurst
and his lovely Clara. He had consented, reluctantly,
to retire from the army, that he might sustain the
declining years of his parents. He had brought his
wife with him, and there they sat, as happy and
beloved a pair as ever lived and loved.</p>

<p>The evening had been sped away with games and
gambols. At last the sports were over, and the
party, closing round the firebrands, yielded to the
inspiration of the hour, and vied with each other in
tales of <i>diablerie</i>. At last, Charles is asked to narrate
his adventure. He told it well, and was rewarded
by alternating deep-drawn breaths of interest and by
peals of laughter. But the mystery still remained
unsolved. While they were all offering their several
explanations, Hazlehurst exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<!-- v2 page 241 -->

<p>"I would pay down a handsome reward to any
one who would tell me where that book was during
those four days!"</p>

<p>"And would you grant an amnesty," asked Clara,
"to all concerned, if you could know it?"</p>

<p>"That I would, with all my heart; for the excellence
of the joke, now that no mischief came of it,
redeems its roguishness."</p>

<p>"Then I can easily satisfy you, my dear," resumed
his wife. "It was all the time in my dressing-table
drawer."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silent astonishment, and
then Hazlehurst exclaimed,</p>

<p>"In your drawer? Why, were you the ghost,
Clara?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," she replied. "But I had an Afrite
that did my will quite as well as any ghost could do."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean, my love?" inquired her husband.
"You are surely jesting. What Afrite do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"You remember poor Peter?"</p>

<p>He nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Well, he was the ghost, and none but he. I never
meant to tell the story; but it is too good a joke to be
kept to one's self."</p>

<p>"But how? What had you to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Remember your proclamation of amnesty, and I
will tell you. You know that he was the servant of
the Vaughans"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Charles, "I knew no such thing&mdash;only

<!-- v2 page 242 -->

that he belonged to a family that had left
the town."</p>

<p>"True," she resumed. "I remember that I kept
back that particular, for fear of exciting your suspicion.
But their servant he was, and treated with
merited kindness for the service done his master;
which resulted in disordering his poor brain. After
he came to live at my father's, he never seemed to
feel at home, but would often wander away at night.
I suspected that his resort was to his old master's
house, and that it was his prowling about it that
gave it its bad name. But, as the officers who first
occupied it were not especially pleasant neighbors, I
did not interfere with his amusements. But when
you came, my dear"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You took me under your protection, and I thank
you," said Charles, laughing.</p>

<p>"Certainly I did," she continued; "but I thought
he might just try your courage for one night. I had
him watched out of the house by my maid, and, from
the glee in which he returned, I had no doubt of his
entire success. That was the first night."</p>

<p>"But pray tell me," asked her husband, "how he
performed the feat, if you happen to know. He must
have had wings, though I never saw them."</p>

<p>"That I can," she replied. "Poor Peter was a
native African, and was as lithe and agile as a monkey,
though you would not think so to look at him.
He could go up the side of a house by the spout,
or the slightest inequalities, like a cat. When you

<!-- v2 page 243 -->

heard him walking over your head, and went up to
look for him, he swung himself out of the window,
shutting it cunningly after him, and, sliding down the
spout, was in a second at the window of your closet.
It was but the work of a moment to do what you
found done, and of another moment to escape as he
entered. It was a sort of spite he felt against intruders
in that house."</p>

<p>"But how came he by my orderly-book?" inquired
Charles.</p>

<p>"That I must claim as my unwilling glory," answered
Clara. "I cross-examined Peter privately on
the subject of his night's adventures, and strictly forbade
his repeating his visits without my knowledge.
I must confess, however, to a strong desire to mystify
you a little further, especially as I had learned
from my maid, who was a flame of your orderly, of
your precautions. I accordingly told Peter that he
might visit your room once more, disturbing nothing,
and only bringing away a single book from the
table. When I found what it was, I was frightened
enough, and, when I learned how much mischief I was
near doing, you know I was half distracted."</p>

<p>"I remember it well, and put it all down to my
own account."</p>

<p>"And so you should, to be sure, Charles. It was
all on your account. I was relieved by finding that
the mischief could be repaired if the book were returned
in time. So I devised several ways of getting
it back to you, which I abandoned, for fear of detection.

<!-- v2 page 244 -->

My party, however, on Friday night, gave me
the opportunity, you recollect, of spiriting away your
servant, and getting poor Peter within your lines
of intrenchment. By watching his opportunity, he
climbed unperceived to your closet, where he ensconced
himself, biding his time. I had told him to restore
it as nearly as he could to the place whence he took
it, for fear of mistakes. In due time, the snoring of
your watchful friends told him that the season of
action was come. He stole into the room, deposited
the book on the table, blew out the lights, knocked
the two sleepers' heads together, and retired, covered
with glory. The rest you know as well as I. This,"
continued Clara, "is the revelation of the only secret
I ever kept from you. It was the first: it shall be
the last."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hazlehurst, as the party rose to retire
for the night, "there is an end of my only ghost-story.
But this is not the first time that THE DEVIL
has had the credit of a piece of mischief which was,
in truth, only due to A WOMAN."</p>

<h2>LEWIS HERBERT;</h2>

<p>AN INCIDENT OF NEW ENGLAND SLAVERY.</p>

</div>

<p>"WORDS are things," said Mirabeau, and very
troublesome things men have sometimes
found them. Abstract propositions are now and
then as dangerous as edged tools. The "rhetorical
flourish" of the Declaration of Independence has
produced effects of which the honest men who
uttered it never dreamed. It produced an explosion
in France, which shook all the thrones of Europe,
and unsettled the deepest foundations of old establishments.
It has overthrown the domestic institutions
of the British West Indies, and is even now
threatening our own with destruction. There is no
telling where its ravages will be stayed. Indeed, a
new idea is at any time a very dangerous thing to
be allowed to go at large in a quiet community. If
a man has hold of one, he must take care how he lets
it go. If he cannot knock it on the head, let him
make a cage for it in his own breast, where it may
serve to divert himself and his particular friends
occasionally; but let him beware how he turns it

<!-- v2 page 248 -->

loose upon society. It will be almost sure to worry
himself first of all, and then to play the very deuce
in the neighborhood. And the mischief is, that, when
a new idea is once on foot, it is next to impossible to
catch it or destroy it. And this, notwithstanding the
respectable part of society has an instinctive antipathy
to the anomalous monster, and does all it can
to prevent its mischiefs and to despatch it, and that,
generally, without much regard to the punctilios of
the chase. The world is sadly infested at this
moment with these vermin. A man cannot be at
peace in his study, his pulpit, his business, his sect,
his party, or his possessions, for them. They respect
not the old philosophies and theologies; they dabble
in physic and in law; they buzz about in churches
and capitols; they interfere between men and their
spiritual and temporal masters; like harpies, they
carry away the very meat and wine from our tables;
they demand a reconstruction of society; they even
come betwixt us and our very bank-stock and money-bags.
I wonder that the well-disposed part of mankind
do not make a grand <i>battue</i> for the extermination
of these pests of the species. We shall never have a
quiet world again until they do.</p>

<p>Our ancestors of the times that tried men's souls
had their own experience of the impracticable nature
of new ideas. The discussions which ushered in the
great "rhetorical flourish" of the Fourth of July,
"that all men were created free and equal," were
not held in a corner, and would not always be limited

<!-- v2 page 249 -->

to a fit audience. The slaves, as they stood behind
their masters' chairs (for be it known to our Southern
brethren, that their favorite system, though ever
a patriarchal, was not always a peculiar one), or
mingled in the excited crowds in the streets, could
not help hearing statements of general principles,
which, though notoriously a stupid generation, they
contrived to generalize sufficiently to make them
include themselves. A practical consequence of
these new ideas of human rights was, that many
slaves made free with so much of their masters' property
as was comprised within the circumference of
their own skins, and, dispensing with the parental
care under which they had grown up, rashly undertook
the charge of themselves. Among this thoughtless
and ungrateful class was Lewis, the slave of a
wealthy and distinguished New England gentleman,
whose real name I shall disguise under that of Herbert.
Lewis was born in the house of Mr. Herbert,
and had grown to manhood in his service. He had
no reason to complain of harsh treatment, or of inattention
to his bodily necessities. He had passed
the middle period of life, and was not many years
younger than his master, who ever treated him with
much consideration and indulgence. In the realms
of the kitchen he ruled with absolute sway,&mdash;one of
those despots of whom most families whose traditions
reach so far back have heard the fame and the deeds.
Mr. Herbert scarcely dared to bring a friend home to
dine with him, without consulting the convenience of

<!-- v2 page 250 -->

Lewis; and as to a dinner-party, the master of the
house knew himself to be but second in command
on such a field-day. Over the larder, the kitchen,
the wine-cellar, the plate-chest, and the china-closet,
he reigned undisputed sovereign.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his ample rule and high prerogatives
(and Lewis magnified his office), he was never
quite satisfied that he had his due. He heard the
word "slave" used as the most ignominious epithet
that could be applied to human infamy, and he learned
to hate it. He heard the blessings of liberty extolled
as the birthright of all mankind, and he wished to
know what they were. He did not see (poor slave
that he was) why he should endure a condition
which so many great men seemed to regard with
such abhorrence, or why he had not as good a right
to that freedom of which they discoursed so eloquently,
as they had. I must do Mr. Herbert, however,
the justice to say, that it was not from his lips,
or in his house, that Lewis imbibed these extravagant
ideas. He was (God bless him!) a stanch Tory, and
held all these levelling doctrines in utter abhorrence.
But the air was tainted with them, and it is not to
be wondered at that poor Lewis should have been
infected, especially as his temperament and condition
predisposed him to receive the contagion. He was
so severely afflicted, that he resolved to leave the
home where he had been born and bred up, and
where he enjoyed all the substantial goods of life, in
pursuit of that phantom, Liberty,&mdash;that <i>ignis fatuus</i>

<!-- v2 page 251 -->

which has often led men such a dance, and at last
left them in the mire. Accordingly, one fine night,
he left his master's house, with a heavy heart and
many tears; for the love of the African race for their
homes and old familiar haunts amounts to a passion.
With many a bitter regret at leaving his old master
and his young mistress, and with many a sigh at all
he left behind, he fared forth in search of what great
men have deemed but a name,&mdash;of freedom and self-mastery.
Whether his experience confirmed or confuted
this philosophy, I am not able to say. All I
know is, that he never returned to his master's house,
though he well knew that he would receive a joyful
welcome, and full restitution to all his former dignities.
Mr. Herbert, though grieved and hurt at the
departure of Lewis, took no measures to recover his
services, but suffered him to seek a better condition
if he could find it.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Several years had passed away since the flight of
Lewis, and no tidings had been heard of him. The
cloud which had been so long gathering, now brooded
in blackness over the land, ready to burst upon it in
a storm of desolation. Indeed, the first red drops,
the forerunners of the coming tempest, had already
fallen at Lexington, and men were awaiting the general
crash with hearts of mingled hope and fear. The
siege of Boston was forming gradually; and the timid
of either party were endeavoring to escape to it or
from it, according as their political principles led

<!-- v2 page 252 -->

them to welcome or to abhor the protection of the
British crown. Mr. Herbert was a loyalist,&mdash;the
most loyal of the loyal. His faith in the omnipotence
of the British Parliament was worthy of
a crown lawyer. He believed that the struggle
would soon be over, and its only result would be
to establish King George III. more firmly than
ever upon his throne and in the hearts of his people.
He had retired several years before to his
country-seat, about ten miles from Boston; and his
advancing age and increasing infirmities indisposed
him to a hasty removal to a beleaguered capital.
Though he had held office under the crown, still he
was not especially obnoxious to the popular side,
and he hoped that he might be permitted to remain
a quiet spectator of the struggle, unmolested by
either party. He thought that an elderly man and
his young daughter could not be regarded as very
dangerous obstacles to the progress of a revolution.
He hoped that age and innocence might be safe from
popular violence. But, good easy man, he had been
brought up under the old ideas. Had he lived at
this time, he would have known better.</p>

<p>It was a blustering evening about the beginning
of May (not the May of the poets, but the May of
New England), in the year of grace 1775. Mr.
Herbert and his daughter, his only child, were seated
together in the parlor (for in those days drawing-rooms
were not) of his pleasant country-house. The
shutters were closed, and the heavy crimson curtains

<!-- v2 page 253 -->

drawn, concealing the deep recesses for the windows
and the inviting window-seats, now, alas! seen no
more below. The light of the noble wood fire
(always a necessary attendant on a New England
May, and that season was what Horace Walpole
would have called a <i>hard</i> spring), roaring up the
ample chimney, its jambs adorned with Dutch tiles,
and its mantel-piece with carving in wood, of which
Grinling Gibbons need not have been ashamed, flashed
comfortably back from the panelled walls, pleasantly
overpowering the rays of the wax candles on the table.
Every panel of the wall supported a full-length portrait
of some of the ancestral Herberts, from the pencil
of the Smiberts and the Blackburns of the early
provincial days; while upon two of them the magic
art of Copley had impressed an immortal moment of
the cheerful age and of the brilliant youth of the pair
before us. Change but the brocaded dressing-gown
and crimson velvet slippers of the old man for his
claret-colored dress-coat with gold buttons, and gold-buckled
shoes, and divest his head of the black velvet
skull-cap turned up with white silk, and you
could scarcely tell which was the picture, and which
the original. And under the green riding-habit,
heavily laced with gold, and the riding-cap, with its
black ostrich-plume, you could not fail to discern the
form and features of the beautiful Emily Herbert.
Curiously carved, high-backed arm-chairs; cabinets
that would have driven a modern collector mad;
tables of every variety of shape, some grasping a

<!-- v2 page 254 -->

huge ball in a single clawed foot, while others sustained
themselves upon an unaccountable confusion
of legs; and other strange furnitures, whereof modern
upholstery knows not the names, were duly arranged
in their proper places about the ample apartment.
The survivors must blush at the confusion in which
they now awake and find themselves, after their half-century
of sleep, in modern drawing-rooms. Books
there were good store, and in the corner, by the door,
a globe, brought from the library for some special
consultation. The father and his fair child sat by
the fire, beside a small table, upon which stood the
supper-tray. The repast was slight; but the display
of plate was such as would be thought unbefitting
the occasion in these days. But in that world, before
fancy stocks,&mdash;when cities under water, and
railways to the Dismal Swamp, were unimagined
things,&mdash;much capital, comparatively, was invested
in plate. And these marks of wealth, reported by
the British officers who were feasted in Boston on
their return from the conquest of Canada, are said
to have been a main temptation to the ministry to
seek to repair their necessities by the taxation of the
Colonies. Tall decanters blushed with the glowing
vintages of Madeira and Portugal, and beside them
an exquisitely delicate bowl of curious china sent
up the fumes of that punch which was our fathers'
"earliest visitation, and their last at even."</p>

<p>The old man sat looking wistfully into the fire,
while his daughter, leaning her cheek upon her

<!-- v2 page 255 -->

hand, gazed anxiously upon his face; for those were
days that made fair young brows look sad and
thoughtful before their time. The clock in the hall
had just struck ten when they were roused from
their contemplations by the sudden opening of the
door. They hastily looked round, and, to their surprise,
the long-lost Lewis stood before them. Time
had somewhat altered him; and his whole air and
bearing was changed from what it was of old: but he
it was. "So you have returned at last," began Mr.
Herbert; but he was hastily interrupted by Lewis.
"Sir," he exclaimed in an earnest tone, "you must
instantly leave this house. You have not a moment
to lose."&mdash;"Leave my house! at this hour! Why,
pray?"&mdash;"Because the mob is coming, vowing your
destruction and that of all that belongs to you."&mdash;"The
mob! and for what?"&mdash;"They say that you
have been the cause of all their troubles; that they
have discovered letters and what not&mdash;but make
haste, sir. They are close at hand. If you will
listen, you can hear them even now." He hastily
opened the window, and a confused murmur of voices
was heard, approaching nearer and nearer. Mr. Herbert,
who had started to his feet at the first address
of his slave, now sunk despondingly back again in
his arm-chair. "I cannot go," said he. "Save my
child, and leave me to my fate."&mdash;"For God's sake,"
exclaimed Lewis, "rouse yourself. They will murder
you. They swear that you are worse than Hutchinson,
and that they will have your heart's blood."

<!-- v2 page 256 -->

The old man shook his head. "Leave me," said he
faintly, "and save her."&mdash;"Dearest father, do you
think I will leave you?" cried Miss Herbert, passionately
embracing him. "If you will stay, I will stay
with you. But will you suffer your only child to see
you murdered before her eyes, and then to be exposed
to the fury of a rebel mob?" This expostulation
seemed to revive him in some degree; and the resolution
beaming from his daughter's eyes gave him new
strength and courage. There was indeed no time to
lose. The shouts and imprecations of the excited
populace were now too distinctly audible, as they
approached the rear of the house. Mr. Herbert was
almost carried out of the house, through the hall-door,
between his daughter and his slave. The house was
about a quarter of a mile distant from the high-road.
There were no artificial grounds around it. The
thick grass grew up to the door, and the natural
lawn was irregularly dotted with aboriginal elms and
oaks which the axe of the pioneer had spared. At
some distance on the left, the lawn was skirted by a
young growth of forest-trees. To this point Lewis
first directed the steps of his charge; and under its
shelter they approached the road before the mob had
reached the house. There he paused for a moment,
to allow his companions to take breath, and to
permit the stragglers who were coming in from the
country around to leave the road free. They looked
towards the house. Lights were seen flashing at
every window. The mob were in search of them.

<!-- v2 page 257 -->

They could hear distinctly their curses of disappointment
and rage. Presently the windows were dashed
through, and the furniture thrown furiously out upon
the lawn. The very quiet room, where, a quarter of
an hour before, all had been peace and stillness, was
stripped of all its treasures to heap high the bonfire
which was to crown the orgies of the night. The
mob had soon broken into the wine-cellar; and this
circumstance, and the prospect of the "festal blaze,"
it is probable, was the safety of the fugitives, by
delaying the pursuit. Presently the bonfire began
to crackle and blaze; and the shouts became more
and more ferocious under the combined influence of
liquor and mischief.</p>

<p>Foolish tourists in America complain that we have
no amusements in this country. I wish they could
have been at Walnut Hill that night. But they are
a perverse generation. Have they never heard of our
merry times of old,&mdash;sacking Governor Hutchinson's
house, and tarring and feathering obnoxious officials,
and the grand old tea-party of '73? And then our
rare sport in burning convents, and halls dedicated
to freedom, and dragging insolent varlets about the
streets, who dared to say that the Declaration of
Independence meant anything, and shooting them
down at the doors of their printing-offices! They
might at least have remembered the fun we have
had in hoaxing "the English epicures" into investing
their solid hoards in a very rotten commodity
of ours, called public faith, worth about as much

<!-- v2 page 258 -->

as a dicer's oath, or the bought smile of a prostitute.
And our repudiation, too! If that be not an excellent
jest, I should like to know what is. I say nothing
of the royal pastimes of burning men alive by a
slow fire, of hunting negroes with bloodhounds and
rifles, of whipping women to death, and selling one's
own children by the pound; for these are the recreations
of our betters, the guarded prerogative of the
privileged classes. This kind of game is strictly
preserved, and secured for the amusement of our
masters, as the chase was in old time confined to
the corresponding class in Europe. Like them, too,
our lords claim the privilege of pursuing their game
over the soil of their vassals. But, though shut out
from these diversions of our superiors, we can still
share with them the stirring excitement of the mob,
the delicate pleasantry of repudiation, and the
delicious irony of lynch law. Why, what would
these cavillers have? No amusements, indeed!</p>

<p>The blazing bonfire soon attracted all the loiterers
in the road, and Lewis seized the opportunity to cross
it, with his companions, into the fields beyond. He
knew that the main roads in every direction would
be soon thronged by yet greater numbers, attracted
by the blaze; and he pushed across the fields towards
the seashore, about two miles off, as the most probable
way of concealment or escape. They hurried along,
as fast as the infirmities of Mr. Herbert would permit,
over the uneven surface of the land; and slow
enough it seemed to his companions. The night was

<!-- v2 page 259 -->

more like one in November than in May, and the
chilly wind drifted the clouds in black masses over
the waning moon. They accomplished in safety
about half the distance, and found themselves in
a lane leading to the coast. Here Mr. Herbert declared
that it was impossible for him to proceed. It
was in vain that his daughter and Lewis endeavored
to re-assure him, and drag him forward. He sunk
despondingly upon the ground. At that moment a
single horseman rode up. He stopped to see what
was the matter. The cloud passed from the moon
for an instant, and he saw at a glance how it was.
"So the old rascal has got away," said he with an
oath; "but I'll soon bring those that will settle his
business." He was just putting spurs to his horse,
when Lewis, seeing the emergency of the case, seized
his bridle fast. It was but the work of a moment.
The horseman was dragged from his seat, and thrown
upon the side of the lane, and Lewis had lifted Mr.
Herbert into the saddle. Leading the horse, and
entreating Miss Herbert to assist in steadying her
father upon his back, he hurried onward as fast as
he dared. This was the more necessary, as they
heard the dismounted cavalier, as soon as he could
recover his breath and his senses, making towards
the light, roaring for assistance. It seemed as
though they never would reach the end of the lane.
Mr. Herbert swayed upon the saddle like a drunken
man, and it was with difficulty that they kept him
from falling. Before they had gained the shore,

<!-- v2 page 260 -->

they knew that their pursuers had been put upon
the right scent. They were nearing them fast, when
the fugitives at last came out upon the sands. The
hurried footsteps, shouts, execrations, and dancing
lights of the mob, seemed fearfully near. What
were they to do? Fortunately, Lewis espied a
gentleman's boat-house, built over a little creek
hard by. "I must make free with Colonel Vernon's
boat," exclaimed he, and, suiting the action to the
word, he demolished the padlock on the door with a
huge stone. By an equally summary process he
freed the boat from its moorings, and pushed it out
of its covert. It seemed to be too late, for the rioters
were almost upon them. He dashed through the
waves, and, taking Mr. Herbert in his arms, deposited
him in the forward part of the boat, and then, in like
manner placing Miss Herbert at the helm, with a
hurried instruction how to hold it, grasped the oars.
A second's delay or misadventure had been fatal; for
the crowd were already upon the beach, exulting
over their prey. But a single stroke of the oars
placed them beyond their reach. Maddened with
drink and rage, the pursuers rushed into the sea
with yells and imprecations, in hopes to seize the
boat. A shower of stones rained upon the fugitives.
But, luckily, the rioters had no fire-arms, and a
sweep or two more of the oars placed them beyond
danger and annoyance. The bay upon which they
were launched was so completely land-locked, that
it was more like an inland lake than the wide Atlantic.

<!-- v2 page 261 -->

They were soon careering over the gentle billows,
leaving the confused noise of the baffled mob
far behind them, and they forgot for the moment,
in the sweet sense of present security, what they had
suffered and lost.</p>

<p>As soon as the first tumults of joy were over, Lewis
explained his agency in the matter. It seems, that,
after he left Mr. Herbert's house, he had gone to
Portsmouth, in New Hampshire, where he lived until
he happened to hear that his old master had removed
permanently into the country. He then returned to
Boston, not long before, and went into the service of
a distinguished patriot. He had left the town previously
to the siege, with this gentleman's family.
It was in this situation that he heard of the popular
excitement against his old master, as a traitor
to the country (whether just or not, we have not
time now to inquire), and of the determination of
the populace to wreak their vengeance upon him.
By pretending to join them, he had been able to get
enough in advance of them to defeat their plans,
as we have seen. While thus explaining, the boat
rounded the point of Long Island, and was instantly
challenged from his Majesty's frigate "Arethusa,"
which lay at anchor in the channel. Explanations
were soon given. The fugitives were cordially welcomed
to the hospitalities of the ship for the night,
and the next morning they were safely landed in
Boston.</p>

<p>Long years passed away. The struggle was over.
The seven years of apprenticeship were at an end;
and the American Colonies, erected into the United
States, had set up the trade of government on their
own account. The expectations of the English
ministry were disappointed, and the hopes of the
loyalists crushed forever. The treaty of Paris had
crowned the work: and the rebellion was transmuted,
by the magic of success, into the Revolution.
Many hearts rejoiced at the prosperous issue; some,
because they glowed with patriotic fires; some,
because they saw a new and untried career of ambition
opened before them; some, because the final
seal was set upon the confiscations and forfeitures
of the troublous times, and confirmed their titles to
other people's estates. But there were, too, sorrowful
spirits and breaking hearts, wearing out sad years of
exile in a foreign land, upon whose ears the distant
rejoicings sounded like the death-knell of their hopes.
To such we turn.</p>

<p>One of the gloomiest days of a London November
was drawing towards its close. The sun vainly
endeavored to pierce the thick fog that buried the
city in an untimely night. The street-lamps were
lighted, though it was not yet sunset: and the windows
of the shops and houses shot forth uncertain
glimmerings into the darkness. A single candle
sufficed to light up a humble room on the fourth
floor of a dilapidated house in an obscure part of
the city. It had not much to reveal. A ragged carpet

<!-- v2 page 263 -->

strove to hide the middle of the floor; a few
common chairs (no two alike), a deal table, and a
rough bedstead, all bearing the tokens of poverty
and the pawnbroker's shop, filled up the disposable
space of the chamber. A handful of coals upon the
grate seemed to be endeavoring to excite themselves
into a blaze, sending out into the room an occasional
puff of smoke as an earnest of their good intentions.
The room was scrupulously clean, but in all other
respects bore the marks of extreme poverty. Upon
the bed reclined an old man, propped by pillows,
apparently in the last stage of life. By his side sat
a woman of perhaps thirty, but upon whose countenance
care and sorrow had done the work of many
years. The unnatural brightness of her eye, the
hectic spot on her cheek, and the frequent though
stifled cough, showed that she was not much longer
for the world than her aged companion. "Emily,
my love," said Mr. Herbert, for he it was, "what
was that knocking that just awoke me?"&mdash;"It was
nothing, sir," replied his daughter, "but Mrs. Hobbs,
coming after her rent. You remember that the doctor's
fee last week, when you were so ill, swallowed
up that week's rent, so that we are now a fortnight
in arrears. But I pacified her by promising she
should be paid as soon as Lewis arrives. You know
it is Saturday night."&mdash;"Ah! she awoke me from a
most delicious dream. I thought I stood, as I often
do in dreams, upon the lawn at Walnut Hill. The
shadows of the old trees fell, sharply defined, on the

<!-- v2 page 264 -->

grass; beyond, the Neponset reflected the trees on
his banks, as he used to do; the Blue Hill was
on my right hand, the old woods on my left, and the
ocean gleamed in the distance. As I stood there, it
seemed to me as if all that I have ever known during
my long life passed in friendly procession before me.
First my parents, and brothers and sisters, then my
school-fellows and college-companions, and so on, as
long as I had a friend left. It seemed as if they were
gathered to some great festival, of which I was the
central attraction. How I rejoiced in the sight of
their beloved countenances!"&mdash;"You have at least
one friend left, sir," interposed his daughter. "True,
my dear, and one worth hundreds that have called
themselves so. What would my proud ancestors have
said, what should I have said in my pride of life,
had it been foretold that I and my child would one
day be dependent for our daily bread on the bounty
of a negro!"&mdash;"Dear Lewis!" said Miss Herbert, "he
has saved our lives many times. What should we
have done without him?"&mdash;"What, indeed!" rejoined
her father. "When the compensation allowed for my
losses by the government was absorbed by my old
English debts, and when, that not sufficing, my very
pension was sold, we must have starved, or come
upon the parish, but for him. God will reward
him." A light tap was heard at the door, which
was gently opened, and Lewis entered, his face
beaming with satisfaction, for it had been a prosperous
week with him. Years had grizzled his hair,

<!-- v2 page 265 -->

and slightly bent his frame; but "his age was like a
lusty winter, frosty, but kindly." He wore the
dress of the waiter of a tavern, in which capacity
he had for many years supported himself and his
<i>proteg&eacute;s</i>. On his arm he bore a covered basket
containing provisions, which he had just been purchasing.
He cheerfully advanced to Miss Herbert,
and gave her money for her clamorous landlady
and other expenses. He then busied himself in
putting the room to rights, and in performing various
services about the sick-bed. There was a cheerful
alacrity about him which showed that his labors
were indeed those of love. There was nothing of
servility about the marked respect which he paid
to Mr. and Miss Herbert. His good-breeding was
learnt in no <i>coterie</i> or court; but it could not have
been surpassed by the most accomplished graduate
of either; for he bestowed the greatest of benefactions
without seeming conscious that they were
such, and saved the pride of his beneficiaries while
he supplied their necessities. He was fully aware
of the obligations under which he had laid the helpless
pair before him, and they knew it; but they
both felt as if his relation to them was that of a
father or a brother. Misery is a great leveller of the
distinctions men have made between themselves and
their fellow-men. But there was nothing in the deportment
of Lewis that ever reminded his former
master and mistress of their obligations to him.</p>

<p>At last, he said that it was time to go, as there

<!-- v2 page 266 -->

was a great supper at the Angel that night. As he
turned to leave the room, Mr. Herbert detained him.
"Lewis," said he, "I feel as if my time was short,
and I have a word or two to say to you." Lewis
put down his hat, and approached the bedside. "My
friend," Mr. Herbert resumed, "my child and I owe
you many lives. You saved us from a mob in
America, and from starvation here." Lewis made a
deprecating gesture; and his countenance indicated
so much distress, that Mr. Herbert proceeded, "I
am not going to thank you, my friend, for that I can
not do,&mdash;God will thank you,&mdash;but to ask you to
continue to be the friend of my child when I am
dead." Lewis looked half reproachfully at his old
master, as if hurt at the implication that such a
request was necessary, and then turned his eyes
upon Miss Herbert. They filled with tears as they
rested upon her; for he saw, though her father did
not, how short a time she was destined to remain
behind him. He could not speak; but he took Miss
Herbert's hand and kissed it. Lord Chesterfield could
not have done it more expressively. Mr. Herbert was
made easy on that point. "Now tell me," he resumed,
"whether you have made any inquiries as to my old
loyalist friends at the other end of the town: do
they suspect where I am?"&mdash;"I have good reason
to know," replied Lewis, "that they believe you
returned long since to America, and have no suspicion
of your being still in London."&mdash;"That is
well," rejoined Mr. Herbert: "let the secret be still

<!-- v2 page 267 -->

kept, that the world" (his little loyalist world) "may
never know of the latter days of Philip Herbert."
He extended his hand to his benefactor, and, sinking
back upon his pillow, closed his eyes. Lewis, in
strong emotion, stole from the room. He returned
about midnight, and, as soon as he looked upon the
face of the sick man, he saw that he was dying.
Miss Herbert had suspected as much, and was
anxiously awaiting his arrival. They exchanged
looks: no words were needed. Lewis took his station
on the other side of the bed, and they remained
all night watching the face of the dying man.
Towards morning, he opened his eyes, and turning
them first upon his friend, and then upon his child,
with that look which only a dying man can give, he
closed them again forever.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I need not prolong my tale. More than half a century
has passed away since all its actors disappeared,
like drops of rain in the ocean. They sleep together
in one of the hideous churchyards of London, and
are forgotten. Of the colonial glories of the Herberts,
of the miseries of their exile, of the heroic self-devotion
of Lewis, not a trace is left, except this imperfect
tradition. Heroic his conduct surely deserves to be
called; for what is heroism but intelligent self-devotion
to an unselfish end, self-sacrifice for the advantage
of others? And when those for whom the
sacrifices of years were made had inflicted upon him
who made them the greatest wrong man can do to

<!-- v2 page 268 -->

man, when self-devotion was thus the companion
of godlike forgiveness, surely it was a height of
virtue to which the annals of the race can furnish
but few parallels. For Lewis was no besotted slave,
whom favors or blows had so imbruted that he could
not discern his own rights, so that he blindly followed
his master, in the belief that he was entitled
to his lifelong service. He had shown his sense of
the degradation and injustice of his servile estate
by leaving the persons and the scenes he loved, for
freedom, though in a worse condition, and refusing
to return again until misfortune had overshadowed
them. That he did not grudge his services, he
showed by his cheerful gift of them to those he
loved, when they were his own to give.</p>

<p>Perhaps there may be some who will deem it
strange that the Herberts should have consented
to be thus the dependents of a negro once their
slave. Such should be very careful of their censures,
for they may reach farther than they think.
Was it more disgraceful to the Herberts to live in
London upon the earnings of a negro, freely offered
for the love he bore them, than it is to grave judges,
learned divines, and honorable women, to live upon
the earnings of negroes in Charleston or Baltimore,
extorted by the fear or the application of torture?
Which is the meaner and more ignominious livelihood
of the two? The same practical results are
worked out on many a broad plantation and in
many a splendid city mansion, that we have seen

<!-- v2 page 269 -->

produced in an obscure garret in London; only the
motive-power that creates them is the scourge or
the branding-iron, instead of generous affection.
There are many men of eminent station, and who
boast loudly of the sensitiveness of their honor,
who eat dirtier bread every day of their lives than
did the Herberts during their last and evil days.</p>

<p>There may be others who cannot understand why
Lewis, when he was so ready to give his services for
nothing in the days of his master's distress, should
have deserted him in the days of his prosperity,
when his fidelity might have met with some reward.
If there be any who cannot perceive the difference
between the free gifts of love and the extorted tribute
of involuntary servitude, I have no time left to
point it out. I can only say, that, if it were an error,
it was one which he shared with the noblest natures
and the most generous spirits. The divine instinct
of liberty, to which he yielded, and which is even
now urging hundreds of fugitives towards the polar
star, is that which has shed the purest glory upon
the page of history, and given to poetry its truest
inspiration. Its manifestations, however coarse or
barbarous they may have been, ever have appealed
with resistless power to the universal human heart.
It was this principle that wreathed with myrtle the
sword of Harmodius, and has invested with immortal
memories the steel of Brutus and the shaft of Tell.
It was this that sent Hampden reeling in his saddle,

<!-- v2 page 270 -->

a dying man, from Chalgrove field; that taught
Milton</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"To scorn delights, and live laborious days;"</p>

</div>

<p>and that made Vane and Sidney lay down their
heads upon the block, as if it were some beloved
bosom wooing them to repose. To those who feel
that freedom is the only element in which the soul
can grow and expand, and who can appreciate the
virtues which are its genial growth, in however
humble a breast or obscure a lot, I cheerfully
commend the memory and the example of LEWIS
HERBERT.</p>

<h2>TWO NIGHTS IN ST. DOMINGO;</h2>

<p>"AN OWER TRUE TALE."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a gay night at the Habitation du Plessis,
that of the 22d of August, 1791. The evening
breeze, fresh from the cool fields of the ocean, had
breathed a new elasticity into hearts that had been
all day fainting beneath the vertical sun of a tropical
midsummer. The first rustle of its wings, as it stirred
the trees that imbosomed the mansion, had summoned
the scattered guests from their various inventions for
speeding the weary day, and assembled them in the
great hall that occupied the whole depth and height
of the central building. The lofty doors were flung
open, and the tall windows on either side of them
expanded their slender valves from the floor to the
ceiling to welcome the healing gale. The small party,
consisting of some half-dozen besides the master and
mistress of the house, were dispersed over the spacious
apartment, in various attitudes and different employments.
A card-table engrossed the souls of the elder
and more sedate division of the company. A younger
group was clustered around the harp of the beautiful

<!-- v2 page 274 -->

Mademoiselle de Mirecourt, the sole heiress of this
noble estate and its thousand slaves. And, when her
song had ceased, the gay Abb&eacute; de Valnais showed by
the brilliancy of his sallies and the piquancy of his
<i>bons mots</i>, that he had left neither his wit nor his
good spirits behind him at Paris, when he fled from
it with the first emigration.</p>

<p>While the hall rung with the gay voices and merry
laughter of this mercurial circle, Mr. Vincent, a young
American newly arrived in the island, and but that
day at the Habitation, stood by himself beneath the
broad veranda, and looked out upon a scene of such
beauty as he had never before gazed upon. Beneath
him lay the plain of the Cape, sleeping in the mellow
light of a moon that might well put to shame most of
the suns of his colder skies, skirted by shadowy mountains,
standing around it like guardian giants, and
terminated in the far distance by the ocean, that
gleamed in the moonlight like a sea of molten silver.
All around him was a wilderness of trees and shrubs,
new to his Northern eye. The multitudinous sounds
of a tropical night fell strangely, but not unharmoniously,
on his ear; while the air that played about
his temples came loaded with perfumes such as might
have breathed from "the spicy shores of Araby the
blest."</p>

<p>He turned his eyes to the scene within, and it was
scarcely less a scene of enchantment to one who had
sprung up to early manhood on the rocky shores of
New England. The lofty and beautifully proportioned

<!-- v2 page 275 -->

hall, filled with all the appliances and means of tropical
luxury,&mdash;somewhat too massive and gorgeous in
its furniture, perhaps, to please a severe eye, and better
suited to the meridian of Paris than of St. Domingo,
but all splendid with gilding and carved work, in the
rich though somewhat questionable taste of the later
days of the French monarchy,&mdash;seemed as if it might
be the palace of Armida rising in the midst of her
enchanted gardens. Out of the hall opened a noble
library, rich with the spoils of all past time. Next
to it, the billiard-room invited the lovers of such pastime.
On the opposite sides, the saloons, or, as they
would now be called, the drawing-rooms, their walls
glittering with gilding, and flashing with mirrors, and
furnished as only French upholsterers then knew how,
seemed as if some magician had transported the saloons
of Paris many a league across the ocean, from
the banks of the Seine to this distant isle. Adjoining
them was the dining-room, furnished with equal richness,
though in a more quiet style; the splendid sideboard
groaning beneath the ancestral plate of many a
generation, and its walls hung with choice cabinet
pictures, chiefly of festive and joyous scenes, suggestive
of wine and mirth. But at this torrid season
the hall, from its greater height and airiness, was the
chosen scene of the reunions of the household. As
the young American turned from the scene of beauty
without to that of splendor within, he thought only of
the happiness which must be the attendant of such
boundless wealth: his mind dwelt as little at that

<!-- v2 page 276 -->

moment on the misery and wrong upon which all this
splendor was upreared, and on the ruin which the
upheaving of those foundations was about to work,
as it did upon the volcanic fires that lay beneath the
exhaustless soil and superb vegetation that surrounded
him, and which might in a moment make the whole
paradise a waste.</p>

<p>And the Marquis de Mirecourt himself, as he laid
down his cards, and joined the rest of the party, when
supper was announced, for a moment forgot, as he
gave himself up to the enchantment of the scene, that
he was an exile from that Paris he so dearly loved.
Though surrounded with every luxury that the most
unbounded wealth could furnish, in the most delicious
of climates, and in the midst of the divinest of scenery,
he still sighed in secret for the narrow streets,
formal gardens, and crowded saloons of the metropolis
of the senses. He had left France amid the very first
mutterings of the Revolutionary storm, and, leaving
his paternal chateau in Dauphin&eacute; to the mercy of his
white slaves, whose hour had at last come, he betook
himself to the estate in St. Domingo, which he had
received by marriage with a young Creole heiress,
whom he espoused from the convent, whither she
had been sent for her education.</p>

<p>On this night, however, his heart was glad within
him; for he was surrounded by kindred spirits,&mdash;men
of high birth, of aristocratic habits, of refined tastes&mdash;such
as had been the companions of his happier
days. The supper-table was laid in the centre of the

<!-- v2 page 277 -->

hall. In all its appointments it would have done
no discredit to the most historical of the houses of
the age of <i>petits soupers</i>. Candelabras of massive
silver poured down a flood of light upon the repast;
tall shades of the clearest crystal guarding the wax
candles from the welcome gale. The most exquisite
of French dishes (for M. de Mirecourt had not been
so improvident as to leave his <i>chef de cuisine</i> behind
him), served upon solid plate, gave place at their due
time to the most delicious of the tropical fruits,
glowing in the beautiful porcelain of S&ecirc;vres, a gift
of royalty when royalty was something more than
a name. The richest and rarest of wines, cooled to
a charm, were marshalled in that festive procession,
which the experience of successive generations of
<i>gourmets</i> had established as their due order of precedence.
The delicate chablis ushered in the feast; the
frolic champagne, and the freshness of the fragrant
Rhine-wine, enlivened its solemn march as it moved
onward; while</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"The gay, serene, good-natured Burgundy"</p>

</div>

<p>threw a sunset glow over its brilliant conclusion.
A slave in the rich livery of the De Mirecourts stood
behind every chair, in seeming, an automaton of
ebony, moved only by the will of him whom he was
appointed to serve. A white Major Domo, in plain
clothes, stood by the temporary sideboard to anticipate
the slightest wish, and to prevent the labor of
its utterance. Nothing that wealth could summon

<!-- v2 page 278 -->

from the four quarters of the globe, to heighten or
add a poignancy to luxury, was absent from that
splendid banquet.</p>

<p>And the circle for which it was furnished forth
was not unworthy of the magic feast. Besides the
Marquis and his beautiful daughter, there was Madame
de Mirecourt, a beauty somewhat past her prime,
who had superinduced an affectation of French vivacity
upon her native Creole apathy and indolence.
Here was the Abb&eacute; de Valnais, of whom honorable
mention has already been made, and the Chevalier
de Tillemont, who had served with distinction in
America under Rochambeau, and now commanded
one of the regiments at Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, with the Cross
of St. Louis suspended from his button-hole. A
cadet of a noble family in France, who was attached
to the general government of the island, at that
time swayed by M. de Blanchelande; a wealthy
planter and his Parisian wife, who were on a short
visit at Plessis; and the American Vincent, to whom
the knowledge of these particulars is due&mdash;made up
the rest of the party. All were in the highest spirits.
The national festivity of spirits, relieved for the time
from the anxieties caused by the progress of the Revolution
at home, and the sympathetic excitement
of the colonial extremities of the French monarchy,
which had checked its genial current, gushed forth with
the joyousness of a fountain leaping from its cavern.
Exile and impoverishment, and blighted prospects,
and disappointed hopes, and homesick yearnings,

<!-- v2 page 279 -->

were all forgotten. The magic of the present hour
triumphed over them all. The troubles in France
and in St. Domingo would soon be over, and the old
r&eacute;gime virtually restored. The fierce populace of
Paris, and their humble rivals in the Provinces and
Colonies, would soon be reduced to their natural position,&mdash;under
the feet of the <i>noblesse</i>. It was as
absurd to suppose that the <i>sans-culottes</i> at home could
permanently lord it over their birthright masters, as
it would be to suppose the negro slaves capable of
maintaining an ascendency over their natural lords.
A sudden tempest had disturbed the elements of
society; but, as soon as it was blown over, things
would find their natural level again.</p>

<p>Ah! there were gay visions seen through that
convivial atmosphere that night. The Abb&eacute; beheld
in the brilliant distance a mitre, perhaps a cardinal's
hat; and there were some dim images that looked
like Mazarin and Richelieu. A marshal's b&acirc;ton
danced before the eyes of the chevalier. The Marquis
saw himself restored to all his baronial rights
and enormous rents; while the opera, the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise, the masquerades and balls of dear Paris,
once more seemed within the reach of Madame de
Mirecourt and her daughter. As to the rich planter,
he saw armies of negroes, and mountains of sugar,
which were to help him to a speedy return to France,
and perhaps to a patent of nobility. The young
American, I fear, had no more gorgeous or chivalric
imaginings than of heavy commissions, great profits,

<!-- v2 page 280 -->

<i>cent per cent</i>, the largest house in Boston, and the
neatest villa in its neighborhood.</p>

<p>It was a night, too, to be remembered for itself,
divested of the tragic interest with which a few hours
invested it. The absurdities and awkwardnesses of
the new men who had taken the place of the old
nobility in the direction of affairs, and the comic
situations into which their ignorance of the conventions
 of society betrayed them, afforded fertile themes
for the gay wit and playful raillery of the Abb&eacute;, and
for the bitter sarcasms of the Marquis. The politics
of the theatre and of the ballet were discussed with a
seriousness which those of the Revolution could not
command. Literature, and the quarrels and private
history of the world of letters, were suggestive
themes to men who had sat at the tables of D'Holbach
and De Geoffrin and Du Deffand, and who
remembered Voltaire and Rousseau and D'Alembert
and Diderot. Scandal, too, lent its wings to
hasten on the hours, and the Queen of the Antilles
witnessed that night the death of many a Parisian
reputation. The crowning satisfaction, however, of
their Epicurean philosophy, to which they often recurred
with new glee, was their happy removal from
the disturbed heart of the kingdom to a spot whence
they could watch its mighty pulsations in safety and
peace. Here, at least, they might live without danger
from the slavish mass, which must, in all civilized
countries, form the groundwork of society. The
quarrels which had distracted the Colony had arisen

<!-- v2 page 281 -->

from the struggles of the superior classes alone for
the mastery. All classes looked with equal contempt
and certainty upon the submissive deportment of the
slaves, whose toil supplied them with their wealth.
Strong in this security, they enjoyed a "Lucretian
pleasure" in standing in safety upon the shore, and
seeing the barks of others buffeted about by the tempest,
or sink foundering in the billows. M. de Mirecourt
felt and said that he could not feel as if all
were lost, even if he never recovered his confiscated
estates in France, so long as a thousand negroes extorted
from the soil of Plessis half a million of livres
every year, and emptied them into his coffers. With
such an income, life might be endured for a time,
even in that banishment. All were blest in the
consciousness of present security and the confident
expectation of future good. Gay wit, light laughter,
and rosy hopes, all helped to chase the hours of that
genial night.</p>

<p>But the most genial of nights must have an end
at last, and the most perfect of suppers cannot endure
forever. At length the party separated, at an
hour when the Southern Cross, quenching its radiance
in the Atlantic waves, told that the morning was at
hand of a day ever memorable in the history of mankind.
They all dispersed "in measureless content,"
weary with mirth, and tired with revelry, little dreaming
that sleep would be that night, for the last time,
a visitant to the princely Habitation du Plessis. All
retired, and all slept, except the American Vincent.

<!-- v2 page 282 -->

The excitement of a scene so new to him drove sleep
from his eyes, and after attempting for an hour or
two to banish from his mind the beaming faces, gay
voices, and ringing laughter of the last few hours, he
rose, and in his <i>robe de chambre</i> walked forth upon
the terrace on which the house was built. The moon
had set, and a world of new constellations glittered
gloriously above his head in a firmament of the
blackest blue. The thousand voices of a tropical
night still maintained their eternal concert. The
vast masses of vegetation which covered the mountain-sides,
and which were to be dimly descried
through the night in the nearer distance, seemed to
be clothed with the very blackness of darkness, gilded,
indeed, by the flashing light of innumerable fireflies.
It was a scene of peace and coolness which soon
quieted Vincent's excited brain.</p>

<p>As he turned to seek his apartment again, he heard
the conch sound in the distance, summoning the
field slaves to their daily toil. He knew then that
sunrise was near, and he waited to look upon its
glories. He had not gazed into the night long, before
the sun vaulted, as it were, from the eastern waves,
"and that moment all was light." The darkness fled
away, like a fiend before the rebuke of an angel, and
all the landscape was bathed in the rejoicing beams.
From the height on which he stood, the vast plantations
of the plain of the Cape seemed like fairy
gardens. No portion of the soil was left neglected.
The soft green of the canefields and of the Guinea-grass

<!-- v2 page 283 -->

beautifully contrasted with the darker hues of
the coffee-plantations, and of the overarching trees
that sheltered them from the scorching heat, looking
like graceful columns supporting a canopy of verdure.
The mountains, feathering to the top with
their forests of enormous trees, reared themselves in
a thousand shapes of beauty, while endless varieties
of light and shade played over their surface. In the
far distance might be discerned the smoke, curling
upwards from the city of the Cape; and farther yet,
the amethyst and emerald sea, with here and there
a white sail gliding over its surface, like blessed
spirits floating over a lake in Paradise. And presently
the long lines of slaves were seen winding their
way to their appointed task, each division driven
by an overseer, a long-lashed whip under his arm,
with which he would ever and anon urge his lagging
herd to a brisker pace. The almost naked forms of
the negroes as they dispersed themselves over the
canefields, and the loose white linen dress and overshadowing
hat of the overseers, beheld from that distance,
and in the midst of that tropical landscape,
seemed to a stranger's eye like a scene from the
Arabian Nights. As Vincent gazed upon it, he felt
no forebodings of a coming woe. There were no
signs in the air of that lovely day, that told of the
dread Nemesis that brooded over the fated island to
avenge the hoarded wrongs of bloody centuries. No
earthquake heralded the downfall of the white race.
No tornado shadowed forth the approaching tempest.

All was bright and fair and calm on that last morning
of slavery.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>There was to be a state dinner-party at Plessis
on the 23d of August. Several of the neighboring
planters had been invited to meet the distinguished
guests who enjoyed its hospitality. This is a serious
matter anywhere and at any time, but especially
beneath an August sun, between the tropics. The
guests had retired to their apartments to endure the
tortures of a Parisian toilet within twenty degrees
of the equator. Madame de Mirecourt sat listlessly
in her dressing-room, bewailing in that sacred retreat
the ungenerous hostility of the climate to <i>rouge</i>,
while its inroads upon the complexion made such
foreign aid the more important, when the door
opened, and St&eacute;phanie, her own woman, hastily entered
the apartment. Madame de Mirecourt wondered,
as much as her apathetic habits would admit
of such an emotion, at her unsummoned appearance;
but then St&eacute;phanie was her foster-sister, and
had lived with her in France, and in a humble
way shared her education, and might be permitted
liberties which could not pass unpunished in any
other slave. The surprise of the mistress was increased,
when the slave cautiously opened all the
doors that led out of the room, as if to ascertain
that no one was listening, and then placed herself
before her.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean, St&eacute;phanie?" drawled

<!-- v2 page 285 -->

out Madame de Mirecourt, "My indulgence has
bounds&mdash;and Le Fronde has a whip!"</p>

<p>"It means," replied St&eacute;phanie in a low voice, "that
the time has come when the accursed Le Fronde's
whip will be broken, and when he will taste some of
his own infernal cruelties himself, and know how
sweet they are."</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, St&eacute;phanie," replied her mistress.
"You have been brought up too tenderly. You
have heard of the proverb that speaks of the insolence
of an unwhipped slave?"</p>

<p>"It is to that tenderness of which you speak, madame,"
replied St&eacute;phanie, "that foolish tenderness,
that you will owe your life, if indeed it can yet be
saved. It is an unwhipped slave that would save
you and yours a faint taste of those horrors which
your race has so long heaped upon mine."</p>

<p>"Just Heaven!" exclaimed the Marchioness, startled
out of her apathy. "What is it you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," solemnly answered St&eacute;phanie, "that
Heaven <i>is</i> just; that the day of my people's deliverance
is come; that this night the whole plain
of the Cape will be filled with fire and blood,&mdash;a
slight atonement for centuries of outrage! The insurrection,
thank God! is so well matured that failure
is impossible. And now it is my folly to wish
to save you for your selfish kindness to me. And
yet"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"God! my daughter!" exclaimed the agonized
mother; for there was that in the tone and looks of

<!-- v2 page 286 -->

St&eacute;phanie which forbade her to question the truth of
her words. "Oh, save her! save her!"</p>

<p>"Command yourself, madame," replied the slave,
"and you may both be saved; but it will depend
entirely on your control of yourself."</p>

<p>"O St&eacute;phanie, St&eacute;phanie!" exclaimed the humbled
mistress, throwing herself at the feet of her
slave, and embracing her knees in an agony of despair.
"Remember all you owe to me! Recollect my
kindness, my indulgence, from the day when we had
but one mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered St&eacute;phanie bitterly&mdash;"yes, I remember
that you treated me like a petted lap-dog or
a tame paroquet. And yet I do owe you more than
you imagine; for, had it not been for the lessons
you permitted me to receive in the Convent of St.
Agnes, this holy insurrection could never have been
so secretly and yet so surely planned as to be certainly
triumphant. But rise, madame: that is a posture
never again to be assumed by one mortal to
another in St. Domingo."</p>

<p>"Not till you have promised me to defeat this
dreadful rebellion," cried Madame de Mirecourt, still
clinging to St&eacute;phanie. "You shall have your freedom;
you shall have wealth such as none of your
caste ever dreamed of possessing; you shall be honored
forever as the savior of the white race, if you
will but delay it till troops can be brought hither
from the Cape."</p>

<p>"My freedom!" replied St&eacute;phanie scornfully. "I

<!-- v2 page 287 -->

thank you, madame; but I mean to take that myself
without the leave of any earthly being. As to delaying
the sacrifice, it is not in my power to do it; but,
if it were, not all the wealth of France would induce
me to defer it a moment when it is ready to be
offered."</p>

<p>"Then I will do it myself," exclaimed the Marchioness,
starting to her feet, and making a movement
towards the door.</p>

<p>"Stay, madame," said St&eacute;phanie calmly, and detaining
her mistress with a grasp not to be resisted.
"You will but hasten the catastrophe by such madness.
The first peal of the alarm-bell,&mdash;the first
shriek that will tell that all is known,&mdash;and in five
minutes twenty knives will be in the heart of every
white man on the estate, and in a quarter of an hour
the flames of Plessis will tell to the whole plain that
the hour is come. As to the women," she continued,
partly unsheathing a knife concealed in her bosom,
"I shall take care, in such case, to save you and
mademoiselle from the terrible vengeance which I
fear the husbands, fathers, and brothers of the outraged
slave-women <i>will</i> wreak on the wives, daughters,
and sisters of their tyrants."</p>

<p>"O God!" exclaimed the distracted Marchioness,
sinking, half-fainting, upon a couch, "what is to be
done?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, madame," said St&eacute;phanie: "your
part is to appear below as if all were well. After you
are dressed, I shall see M. le Marquis, and concert my

<!-- v2 page 288 -->

plan with him. Remember that all depends on your
playing your part well, so that no suspicion may be
awakened in the minds of the slaves behind your
chairs. For I need not say that suspicion would be
instant death. And now, madame, to your toilet."</p>

<p>And never since St&eacute;phanie had performed those
offices about the person of her mistress did she discharge
them more accurately than on that last day
of her servitude. Madame de Mirecourt, half-stunned,
and feeling the power of a strong mind over a weaker
one, yielded herself implicitly to the hands of her
slave, and promised to obey her directions in all
points. She wore her diamonds, at the instance of
St&eacute;phanie, and concealed other valuable jewels about
her person.</p>

<p>"These would have been mine," said St&eacute;phanie.
"But no matter: you will need them more than I in
the strange land whither you must go." Madame de
Mirecourt shuddered at the idea of poverty and exile;
but nearer and worse dangers soon drove it from her
mind. Heavens! What a toilet was that!</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was a princely banquet that graced the great
dining-room at Plessis that day, but as dreadful to
some of those that sat around the board as was the
Egyptian feast to the novice, when the falling rose-wreath
disclosed to him the grim features of his
skeleton companion. M. de Mirecourt had managed
to inform all the gentlemen of his household
guests of their danger, and of his plan of escape.

<!-- v2 page 289 -->

The circumstances with which St&eacute;phanie had confirmed
her story had put the matter beyond a doubt.
Nothing remained for them but to save their lives
by flight, according to the plan she pointed out. And
there they sat in full dress around the splendid
table, with this dreadful secret weighing upon their
hearts, playing the part of gay revellers! Ah, it
was a ghastly feast! How changed their hearts
since the merry hours of last night's revel! The
ancient story, of the sword suspended by a single
hair over the head of the parasite, as he reclined at
a regal banquet such as was spread for his tyrant,
did but shadow forth the horrors of that night! Oh,
those interminable courses! It seemed as if they
would never come to an end. How "palled the
tasteless meats and joyless wines!" And then those
insufferable guests of the day, who knew nothing of
the fearful truth&mdash;how they did prose! They ate
and drank as if they knew that it was their last
dinner, and were resolved to make the most of it.
They discussed the viands and wines as if an accurate
acquaintance with their virtues was the necessary
passport to paradise. And then they talked of their
crops and their slaves, the annual loss by overworking
and necessary correction, and all the economics
of whipping and starving and maiming&mdash;and this
to men who knew that the slave behind every chair
had a cane-knife, sharpened on both sides, in his
bosom! Human nature, even French human nature,
could not have endured it much longer.</p>

<!-- v2 page 290 -->

<p>At last&mdash;and it <i>was</i> an at last&mdash;the guests made
a move to depart, murmuring something of the lateness
of the hour and the distance they had to go,
hoping to be pressed to stay with hospitable urgency.</p>

<p>"Must you go, indeed!" exclaimed the Marquis,
assuming an air of half-tipsy jollity. "Then we will
all escort you a mile or two on your way, and drink
a parting bottle by the roadside, in the moonlight."</p>

<p>The proposition was hailed by all, in the secret
and out of it, as a most whimsical and admirable
frolic. The coaches were ordered round; and the
Chevalier de Tillemont directed his horse to be
saddled, as better fitting his knightly character.
When the carriages came round, that of the Marquis
took the lead, and was followed by two others of the
planter guests. As they were entering them, Vincent
protested against being enclosed in any such
prison upon wheels, and declared his intention of
mounting the box, so that he might see the country
to the more advantage. As the moon had not yet
risen, and it was almost pitch dark, this was hailed
as an excellent jest; and the Abb&eacute; also, in the same
vein, insisted upon mounting the box of the carriage
that came next. M. de Tillemont rode alongside of
the third.</p>

<p>In this order they proceeded until they came near
the place where the two planters would turn off from
the road to Cape Fran&ccedil;ois. Here, at a signal from the
Chevalier, Vincent pointed a pistol at the head of

<!-- v2 page 291 -->

the coachman by whose side he sat, and threatened
him with instant death unless he suffered himself to
be pinioned peaceably. The Abb&eacute;, at the same moment,
threw his arms round those of his neighbor,
and confined them until he could be secured; while
the Chevalier, mounted on a charger which obeyed
the least touch of the foot or slightest word, with a
pistol in either hand, took charge of the third coachman
and of all the footmen, and with the help of
the attach&eacute;, and of the gentleman who had been a
visitor at Plessis, succeeded in binding them all on
the ground before they well knew what had happened
to them. He then briefly stated the exigency
of the case to the planters who were not in the
secret, and who were scarcely less astonished at the
treatment their slaves had received than they were
themselves. They were not convinced, however, of
the danger. Their contempt of the blacks supplied
whatever might be wanting in personal or moral
courage, and they persisted in proceeding to their
own homes. There was no time for expostulation:
so, after their slaves had been disarmed, they were
set at liberty, and proceeded with their masters
across the plain. It is needless to say that those
masters never saw the light of another sun.</p>

<p>The rest of the party crowded into M. de Mirecourt's
carriage, which Vincent undertook to drive,
with the exception of the Chevalier, who, with a
passing farewell, put spurs to his horse, and galloped
off at the top of his speed along the rough road as it

<!-- v2 page 292 -->

wound around the side of the mountain; the sparkles
from his horse's hoofs marking his course long after
he himself was lost in the darkness. Vincent was no
experienced whip, and was entirely unacquainted
with the road; so that their progress seemed slow to
their excited fears. Thus they proceeded through
the dark night, when of a sudden a ruddy glow shot
through the air. They turned their heads, and far
away, where it was notched into the mountain's side,
they saw Plessis one sheet of flame. It was a beautiful
though a fearful sight; but it was one that told
the Marquis that he was a beggar.</p>

<p>They were now emerging from the mountain-side
upon the plain. They had been hitherto unmolested;
but the number of estates they would have to pass
rendered the next two leagues of their journey full of
danger. This was soon made more clear to them; for,
as if they had waited for the signal-fire to be kindled
on the height of Plessis, the whole plain, and the
sides of the skirting mountains, were lighted up with
a hundred conflagrations. In the glare of this fearful
illumination they drove on for a mile or two farther,
when they came to an estate the mansion of which
was but a bowshot from the road. It was just
wrapped in flames,&mdash;the negroes could be seen
dancing in mad mirth around it,&mdash;while fearful
shrieks, such as Vincent remembered to have heard
ushering in the day at the Cape, and even at Plessis,
though now issuing from other lips, were heard above
the roar of the fire and the shouts of the insurgent

<!-- v2 page 293 -->

slaves. It was soon plain that they were perceived,
and their errand suspected. They were loudly ordered
to stop; and, when this command was disregarded,
a company of thirty or forty negroes set out
in full pursuit. It was a pastime that had the charm
of novelty to the pursuers. They had some of them
been the quarry of the slave-hunt; but they had none
of them ever engaged before as the hunters in the
chase of the white man. Vincent had nothing left
for it but speed. He lashed the horses with all his
strength, and gave them the rein. They dashed onward
with furious speed, and he hoped soon to leave
his pursuers far behind. But unluckily, when in full
career, sweeping away over the plain, one of the
horses fell, and, though he almost instantly recovered
himself, the accident gave a fearful advantage to the
pursuers.</p>

<p>Before Vincent could put up his steeds to their full
speed again, it was clear that the enemy were gaining
upon him. Their yells sound nearer and nearer; the
light of their torches flashes brighter and brighter
from behind; their footsteps fall more and more numerously
upon his ear. The taste they have had of
the white man's blood that night has only maddened,
not satisfied, their thirst. They are even now upon
him. Some seize the spokes of the wheels to hold
them back. Others rush to the horses, and attempt
to hamstring them, and to cut the traces. Vincent
has no longer any control over them as they plunge
and rear in pain and terror. He gives up all for lost;

<!-- v2 page 294 -->

and well he may, for a more formidable band
never set about a work of death. Some bore in their
hands huge brands from the burning house, which
they waved over their heads; some brandished their
cane-knives in their hands; and others had them
fastened to long poles. Some were armed with axes,
and some with huge iron bars. Some were almost
naked; and others were fantastically dressed in the
rich damasks and brocades of their masters and mistresses.
Almost all had blood on their hands or on
their garments. They seemed like fiends who had
been for a long time subjected to the will of a magician,
but who had at length surmounted the charm,
and were enjoying the delight of torturing their
tormentor.</p>

<p>They gathered around the coach, and their cry was
for blood. Vincent exhorted the gentlemen within
the carriage to sell their lives as dearly as they might.
They were only armed with the short rapier, which at
that time formed an indispensable part of full dress:
he had, besides, a pair of pistols. With these, he attempted
to keep the insurgents at bay, but with
brief success. Uttering a charm which they believed
a specific against gunshot wounds, they rush upon
him, clambering in crowds upon the coach-box. Others
force open the doors of the carriage, and are about
to drag out the occupants. All seems to be over
when a rushing sound is heard in the distance.</p>

<p>What is it? The assailants pause for a moment
to listen. It is surely the tread of horses' feet. It

<!-- v2 page 295 -->

sweeps on nearer and nearer. Can it be possible?
Yes, it is indeed the gallant De Tillemont, at the
head of a detachment of his regiment, coming to
their aid at their utmost need. They advance at
their fullest speed,&mdash;their carbines are unslung,&mdash;they
pour a sharp though scattering fire upon the
insurgents, and then charge upon them with the sabre.
The negroes had not then learnt that they were a
match for the regular troops of France, and they
slowly and reluctantly retired, and left their prey.</p>

<p>This was indeed a deliverance out of the very jaws
of death. But there was no time for congratulations
or compliments. They did not know but that a multitude
to which their force might be unequal would
intercept their return. Troop horses hastily supplied
the place of those that the insurgents had wounded,
and in the shortest possible time they were on their
rapid way to the city. Years of sensation were
crowded into that hour. It was worth the experience
of many a long life to have shared that brief but
fearful journey from Plessis to the Cape. They met,
however, with no further opposition, and entered the
city just as the bell of the cathedral tolled twelve.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>They were safe for the night; but Vincent was
sure that the insurrection would soon sweep over the
city. He had a vessel in the harbor, under his control,
and he determined to make use of her for his
escape. He offered a passage to all his late companions
in peril. None accepted it but M. and Madame

<!-- v2 page 296 -->

de Mirecourt, and their daughter. The rest all felt
safe under the protecting arm of France. But many
months had not elapsed, before they had all of them
fatal reason to regret their confidence. The very
next day, Vincent and his late hosts set sail for
America; and within a fortnight of the day when
M. de Mirecourt rejoiced in the possession of a thousand
slaves and half a million of rent, he stood upon
the shores of New York without a resource save the
jewels which St&eacute;phanie the slave had secreted about
the person of her mistress. For a while after his
return to Boston, Vincent heard of them often as
favorites in the fashionable circles of New York; but
at last they disappeared, and all his researches after
them were in vain. Whether they returned to France,
and there perished in the Days of Terror, or whether,
after their stock was exhausted, they carried their
poverty to some distant part of America, where,
under a different name, they could without shame
support themselves by manual labor, is yet uncertain;
and it is not likely that it will now ever be known.
The latter fate was most probably theirs. It was a
common one in those days of change. Many of the
proudest of the historical names of France fled to
this country at the time of the emigration, and, after
shining a while in this new firmament, set forever,
and were seen no more below. Many an emigrant
sunk a marquis, a viscount, or a chevalier in one city,
and rose a cook, a confectioner, or a hair-dresser in
another. In that obscurity did many of the noblest

<!-- v2 page 297 -->

names of France go out, and leave no trace behind.
Had Sterne made a sentimental journey to this country
fifty years ago, he might have seen stranger
sights than a Chevalier de St. Louis selling pies in
the streets of Versailles. If such were the fate of
the Marquis de Mirecourt and his family, we may at
least hope that they were happier, as they were certainly
more innocent and useful, in their humble
occupations, than when they rioted in luxuries wrested
from the unwilling hands of a thousand slaves.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Such was the story which Mr. Vincent would tell
on a winter's evening to his children and his friends.
It has a moral, which is not limited by the scene nor
the actors of this little drama. It exemplifies the
operation of eternal and universal laws. It shows
that the day of account will surely come wherever
there is wrong or crime. Who knows what country
may afford the next example of this awful retribution!
Nemesis never sleeps. Though she is long-suffering,
she forgets nothing, and overlooks nothing.
When men have filled their cup with blood and
cruelties and unutterable abominations, to its brim,
it is that very cup that she commends to their own
lips. There is but one Power of might enough to
wrest it from her inexorable hand, and that Power
is REPENTANCE.</p>

<p class="small">"But when returned the youth? The youth no more<br/>

But forty years were past, and then there came<br/>

A worn-out man, with withered limbs and lame,<br/>

His mind oppressed with woes, and bent with age his frame."<br/>

CRABBE.</p>

<p>I WAS once a great pedestrian, and have performed
feats in my time which should entitle me to a
respectable standing, if not an exalted rank, in the
sporting world. I used to think little of forty miles
a day, and have "made" my six miles within the
hour. But all that is over.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"It is not now as it hath been of yore."</p>

</div>

<p>Walking for its own sake, like virtue on the same
terms, is but too apt to be an enthusiasm of youth.
I have not, indeed, entirely subsided into the opinion
which a gentleman, recently deceased, who successively
distinguished himself in the gay world, at the
bar, and in the pulpit, once pronounced <i>ex cathedra</i>,
in my hearing,&mdash;that "legs are given to man only to

<!-- v2 page 302 -->

enable him to hold on to a horse;" but still a sober
ten miles satisfies me now. It will be well for me
if this be the only good habit of my youth from
which I have fallen away.</p>

<p>During my days of pedestrious grace I resided in
Boston, and my walks made me tolerably familiar
with the beautiful country that environs it for ten
miles on every side; itself being ever the crowning
charm of the landscape. It is a great advantage
Boston possesses over most other cities, that one can
almost immediately exchange the bustle of the streets
for some of the most lovely and rural scenes in the
world. An hour's drive, or an afternoon's walk, transports
you, as it were, into the heart of the country.
The winding country-roads and green lanes, hedged
with barberry-bushes, might beguile you to believe
that you were a hundred miles from a great city,
were you not continually tempted to turn and see
how gracefully, at airy distance, she seems to sit
upon her three hills, and lord it over the prospect.</p>

<p>One fine autumn afternoon about ten years ago,
when I had been</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Wasting in woodpaths the luxurious day,"</p>

</div>

<p>I found myself on the summit of one of a chain of
hills, looking towards the city. And what a prospect
lay before me! On my right were hills covered with
woods clothed in the gorgeous hues of autumn, looking
like troops of "shining ones" just alighted on
some mission of mercy; in the middle distance,

<!-- v2 page 303 -->

tufted groves, village spires, farmhouses, meadows
dotted with cattle, and a brimming river sparkling
in the slanting rays of the sun; in the distance the
city, relieved against the Blue Hills; and on the left
the noblest burst of ocean,&mdash;Nahant breaking the
expanse, with Egg Rock beyond, and then stretching
leagues and leagues away, till it had put a girdle
round the earth. It was a noble prospect.</p>

<p>After I had feasted my eyes and heart on these
glorious apparitions, I was recalled to a sense of the
things of earth by the reflection which was forced
upon me, that I had had no dinner. I accordingly
marked from my hill-top, where all the country lay
mapped out at my feet, the course I would pursue on
my return home. Descending the precipitous face
of the hill, I plunged into</p>

<p class="small">"An alley green,<br/>

With many a bosky bourne from side to side,"</p>

<p>which led me, though somewhat deviously, in the
direction of the city. After I had followed its windings
for some miles, I began to wax thirsty, and, to
say sooth, a little weary to boot. So I looked about
me as I walked, for some hospitable door at which,
though no saint, I might ask for a cup of cold water.</p>

<p>I pique myself on my skill in the physiognomy of
houses, and it is not at every door, any more than
of every man, that I would ask a favor. Accordingly
I passed by several houses of some pretensions, but
which had to my eye an ill-favored and ill-conditioned

<!-- v2 page 304 -->

expression, and passed onward till I came to
one that I thought might answer my purpose. It had
not much to recommend it in its exterior. It was a
cottage of the very humblest description, the walls
of bare boards, blackened with age; but yet there
was something about it that made my heart warm
towards it. It stood a little withdrawn from the
road, and the grass grew green up to the broad flag-stone,
half sunk into the earth, which served for its
door-stone. There was no litter or dirt about the
door; the windows were all whole; and there was a
general air of neatness about it which showed that
the poverty of the inhabitant was at least not
sordid.</p>

<p>It had a promising look, and I knocked at the door.
It was opened, after a short interval, by an "old, old"
woman, as black as jet, slightly bent by age, and leaning
upon a staff. Though not expecting to see a
person of color, I was pleased to find, that, as far as I
could judge from her appearance, I had not been deceived
by the lineaments of her habitation. Her dress
was of the coarsest materials; but the snowy whiteness
of her cap and handkerchief, and the scrupulous cleanliness
of her checked gown, proved the presence of that
virtue which is said, on high authority, to be akin to
godliness. She received me with the kindliness and
good-nature which mark her race, and, upon making
my necessities known, she cordially invited me to
walk in. This I did, nothing loath; and, while my
hostess was selecting the best of her three mugs for

<!-- v2 page 305 -->

my service, I seated myself, at her pressing instance,
in one of her two flag-bottomed chairs, and took a
survey of the premises.</p>

<p>They were rough and bare enough, God knows,
but still were not without that air of comfort which
thorough neatness and good order can give to the
humblest dwelling. Her house could boast of but
one apartment; but that was sufficient for her purposes.
A bed, two chairs, an invalided table, and a
pine chest made up the sum of her furniture. The
walls could boast of no decoration except a print, over
the head of the bed, of the capture of Andr&eacute;, in which
the cow-boy militiamen were looking most truculently
virtuous as Andr&eacute; tempted their Roman firmness with
a watch of the size of a small warming-pan. The floor
was well scrubbed and sanded; and some peat embers
smouldered upon the hearth. After I had slaked my
thirst with some delicious water, of which she was
justly proud,&mdash;all cold and sparkling from the open
well, ministered unto by the picturesque puritanic
well-pole,&mdash;she resumed her chair and her knitting;
and as I rested myself I entered into conversation
with her.</p>

<p>She seemed pleased with the interest I felt in her
affairs, and simply and frankly told me all she had to
tell about herself and her way of life. She had lived
on that spot for many years, and had mainly depended
upon her skill as a laundress for her subsistence. As
she had grown old, however, and the infirmities of age
began to press heavily upon her, she confined herself

<!-- v2 page 306 -->

to the nicer branches of her profession; for the exercise
of which the ladies of the neighborhood supplied
her with ample materials. Whatever deficiency there
might be in her means of comfort, after she had done
her best to provide them, was cheerfully made up to
her by the kindness of her neighbors; for, to do them
justice, neglect of the poor, black or white, at their
own doors, is not one of the vices of the people of
New England. She seemed to be very well satisfied
with her share of the good things of this life, and
evinced a degree of unaffected contentment which is
not always seen to accompany a much higher degree
of prosperity. I was greatly interested in her character
and history, and never walked in that direction
again without calling to see her. In the course of my
acquaintance with her, I learned at different times
the simple incidents of her story, which I am about
to relate. They seemed to me, when I heard them,
to be worth the telling; but I am by no means sure
that anybody else will be of the same opinion. Such
as they are, however, you have them here.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was born somewhere about the middle of
the last century, in the family of the Honorable James
Mallory, for many years one of his Majesty's Council
for the Province of Massachusetts Bay. He used to
live in that fine old house with the Corinthian pilasters,
and the magnificent lime-trees in the courtyard,
which stood on your left hand as you went down
King Street towards Long Wharf. It vanished years

<!-- v2 page 307 -->

ago, and gave place to one of the granite temples of
Mammon which have long since thrust from their
neighborhood all human habitation. There was
Ph&oelig;be born. Her father and mother were both of
them native Africans, who had lived out all their
life of servitude under the roof of Mr. Mallory. They
were fortunate in falling into such good hands. The
few New England slaves were mostly owned by the
wealthy families, and were chiefly employed as house-servants,
and their treatment was at least as good as
that of the same class in any country. But, Ph&oelig;be
said, nothing could prevent her father from remembering
the day, when, as he was hunting the hippopotamus
in the sacred river that flowed by his hut,
just as he leaped from his iron-wood canoe to draw
the monster ashore by the line fastened to his spear,
a party of a hostile tribe rushed from among the
reeds, and hurried him to the seacoast, fifty miles
away, and there sold him to a Bristol trader. To be
sure, he had obtained civilization and Christianity by
his involuntary emigration; but&mdash;as the one appeared
to his half-savage mind to consist in wearing clothes,
and cleaning another man's shoes; and the other in
sleeping on his knees through family prayers, and in
being obliged to listen, from the gallery of the Old
South Church, for several hours every Sunday, to
sermons which he could never have comprehended,
delivered in a tongue he very imperfectly understood&mdash;he
must not be blamed as ungrateful, if he thought
them but inadequate compensations for the exchange

<!-- v2 page 308 -->

he had made of the sunny skies and golden sands of
Africa for the leaden firmament and rocky coast of
New England.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was more fortunate than her parents in
being "native, and to the manner born;" so that
her lot was much more tolerable than theirs. She
was kindly treated, and taught to read and write.
She felt all the strong attachment of the African
race to the house in which she was born and to the
family which had brought her up. To the end of
her days she believed that there was never a house
that equalled in magnificence that of Mr. Mallory
in King Street. There was never anything half so
graceful and dignified as the manners of Mr. Mallory
himself, or half so beautiful and accomplished as the
daughters, or so handsome and good-natured as
the sons, of his house. Many were the Old-World
stories she told me of the loves and the feuds of
that generation,&mdash;of their joys and their griefs,
of their festivities and their funerals. A petted
slave, brought up from infancy in one of the foremost
families of a small community such as Boston
was then, she became a perfect incarnation of all
the gossip and scandal of that little world. And
some very choice bits of both I extracted from her,
I assure you. She certainly had no artistic skill in
her narrations, and yet there was a life in the very
simplicity with which she related facts, which painted
them vividly to the mind's eye; and I think I have
a clearer notion of the way in which people lived in

<!-- v2 page 309 -->

Boston eighty years since, from them than from more
generally recognized authorities.</p>

<p>Her admiration, however, was not entirely monopolized
by the higher powers of the family. There was
a certain Ambrose, who had also been born in the
house a few years before Ph&oelig;be, and had been
brought up along with her, who claimed his share.
They had played together as children, and worked together
when they grew older, and it will not surprise
the experienced reader to hear that they fell in love
with each other as soon as they were old enough to
take the infection. Ambrose was a fine, well-made,
athletic young fellow, shrewd and capable, and of
the most imperturbable good-humor. His skill in
music was such that he was often summoned to the
parlor, with his violin, to excite the dance when his
young masters and mistresses had their friends with
them. Both Ambrose and Ph&oelig;be were great favorites
with the whole family,&mdash;old and young, bond
and free,&mdash;and their loves were looked upon by all
with complacent eyes. They formed a little under-plot
in the domestic drama, which was not unamusing
or uninteresting to the actors or actresses in similar
scenes above stairs. Their true love flowed smoothly
on, and it seemed as if no obstacles could be interposed
to disturb its course. It was a conceded thing
that at some convenient season Ambrose and Ph&oelig;be
were to be married.</p>

<p>While the affairs of the humble lovers were in this
prosperous train, great events were at the door. The

<!-- v2 page 310 -->

signs which prognosticate a coming storm were frequent
and menacing. Voices were heard in the air,
telling of disaster and woe to come. Portents were
seen in the political firmament,</p>

<p class="small">"With fear of change<br/>

Perplexing monarchs."</p>

<p>It was obvious to all discerning persons who were
willing to see, that great changes were at hand. Mr.
Mallory was a Tory, as might be expected from his
official station and position in society. Like many
others of his way of thinking, he exaggerated the
power of the British king to suppress disaffection,
and undervalued the powers of resistance of the
colonists. Though he had never permitted himself
to doubt that the fever-fit of the Province would
soon pass away, still his position was sufficiently
disagreeable while it lasted. He had made himself
obnoxious to the popular party, and his situation
was at times worse than disagreeable: it was
absolutely unsafe. Ph&oelig;be described to me the
night when the mob, flushed by the impunity which
had attended their previous excesses, came trooping
down King Street to execute summary justice on
the Tory Mallory. Their approach was so sudden,
that the family had barely time to escape as they
were, through the garden, leaving the candles burning,
and the work-boxes and books open on the table,
as they fled.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory's house would probably have shared

<!-- v2 page 311 -->

the fate of Governor Hutchinson's, had it not been
for a singular and unexpected diversion. When the
mob was gathering in the street in front of the house,
and preparing for the assault, the hall-door opened
suddenly; and Ambrose, like a new Orpheus, issued
from it with his violin in his hand. He immediately
struck up a lively air, and the effect was magical.
The many-headed monster was in a better humor than
usual that night. Whether it was that the edge of
its appetite was in some degree taken off by the sop
it had already had, or whether it was that the patriotic
punch (which has never yet had its due as one
of the main promoters of the Revolution) had not
yet more than half done its work, still the mood of
the mob was changed at once from mischief to fun.
This unexpected apparition moved their mirth; and
Ambrose, taking advantage of their humor, performed
such antic tricks in the moonlight as threw them into
inextinguishable fits of laughter. With all the caprice
of a mob, they themselves soon began to dance
to his music; and not all the influence of their leaders
could bring them up again to the point of mischief&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"So Orpheus fiddled, and so danced the brutes."</p>

</div>

<p>This danger over, the arrival of the British regiments
prevented any apprehension of its renewal.
But the situation of the Mallorys was gloomy and
uncomfortable enough. The gayeties which the arrival
of the forces produced in the loyal circles were
no compensation for the breaking-up of old friendships,

<!-- v2 page 312 -->

and for the doubt and uncertainty that hung
over their future. At last the provincial resistance
began to assume a more threatening form. The siege
clasped the town around with its iron arms. The
beautiful hills which encompass the town were now
changed into mimic volcanoes, belching forth fire and
smoke and death against it. All who could and
dared fled from its borders. Mr. Mallory's political
offences were too flagrant to allow him any choice.
He was obliged to abide by the result of the conflict
where he was. To be sure, neither he nor his children
would ever admit, even to themselves, the
probability of the rebels being ultimately successful;
but then there could not but be painful misgivings
as to what might befall before the insurrection was
finally quelled. It was a dismal winter, indeed, as
Ph&oelig;be told its private history. Not all the balls and
assemblies and private theatricals that were devised
to while away the weary hours could dispel the
sense of pain and apprehension which their situation
excited in the breasts of the loyalists.</p>

<p>It was not long before the forebodings of their
prophetic hearts were fulfilled. The dreary winter
wore away and the dreary spring began. The intentions
of the Commander-in-chief were kept strictly
secret; but there were plenty of surmises abroad as
to what they were. But that Boston, open as it was
to the sea, of which England was the mistress, would
be occupied by the British forces until the rebellion
was suppressed, was a thing that had settled down

<!-- v2 page 313 -->

into a recognized certainty. It could not enter into
a loyal heart to conceive that the royal troops could
be dislodged from the capital of New England by the
rabble rout that surrounded them. But at last the
fatal news fell upon their ears like a clap of thunder,
that the town was to be evacuated, and abandoned to
the besiegers. What distress and despair of those
who had placed themselves and all they had under
the protection of the British sceptre, and who found
it powerless in their utmost need! All remonstrance
on their part was in vain. General Howe was inflexible,
for he knew that his post was no longer
tenable; but he assured the distressed loyalists of
all possible assistance in removing their persons and
effects beyond the reach of the exasperated rebels.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be described to me with lifelike effect, for it
was what she had the most to do with, the confusion
of the few days that elapsed between the announcement
of the intended evacuation and the embarkation.
The grief of the Mallorys at leaving the home
of their childhood, perhaps forever, and the uncertainty
which hung over their future fate, was disturbed
by the necessity of deciding which of their
effects they should take with them. A limited
amount of freight was all that could be possibly
assigned to each refugee, and it was hard to decide,
among all the objects which habit had rendered necessary,
or association dear, which should be chosen,
and which abandoned. All was hurry and bustle
and distress. They were obliged to select such

<!-- v2 page 314 -->

articles as contained the most value in the compactest
form, and to leave the rest behind. Their clothes,
plate, jewels, and such other valuables as they could
compress into the smallest possible space, were all
that they could take with them. But all the old
companion furniture, speaking to them of ancestry
and of happier days, the family pictures, the trifles
which affection magnified into things of moment,
because they were seen through the atmosphere of
love and friendship which surrounded them, all, all
had to be left behind them.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful night, that of the 17th of March,
1776&mdash;the last that they were to spend in the home
of their fathers. Early the next morning they were
to embark on board the transports, to go they knew
not whither. The young ladies, deprived of their
usual employments, and their recent mournful occupation
being over, as the trunks and packing-cases
were already on board, wandered about the house,
from room to room, like ghosts haunting scenes once
loved, reluctant to look their last upon those beloved
walls. The gentlemen of the family were busy in
making what arrangements they could to secure the
wrecks of their property. It was long past midnight
before they retired to rest, if rest they could,
for the last time under that old-accustomed roof.
They had not been long retired, however, when they
were aroused again by a clamorous knocking at the
door, and the intelligence that they must repair at
once on board ship, if they would not be left behind.

<!-- v2 page 315 -->

The rebels had taken up a position on Nook's Hill,
which rendered it necessary to evacuate the town at
an earlier hour than the one first appointed. The confusion
may be imagined. The carriage was at length
at the door, and performed its last service in conveying
the family to the wharf, before it passed into the
hands of the patriotic gentlemen who had purchased
it at a fourth of its value. They found, with some
difficulty, the transport assigned to them, and, embarking,
awaited the signal of departure.</p>

<p>While they were thus expecting their sailing-orders,
one of the young ladies discovered, that, in her
hurry, she had left her watch behind her. It had a
value beyond its intrinsic worth, as having belonged
to her mother. Her distress was great, and the question
arose whether there was time to send for it.
The captain of the transport gave it as his opinion
that there would be ample time. Then who was to
be the messenger? Ambrose could not be spared
from some essential service in the arrangement of the
luggage: so Ph&oelig;be alone remained to perform the
errand. She was accordingly despatched, with strict
injunctions to make a speedy return. It was a raw
blustering March morning, and, as Ph&oelig;be threaded
the narrow streets, the light snow was blown in fitful
gusts in her face. She made a somewhat wide circuit
to avoid the principal streets, which were now full of
soldiers; the inhabitants being under orders to keep
within doors until a certain hour. She had some
difficulty, too, in procuring the house-key from the

<!-- v2 page 316 -->

neighbor who had charge of it; and when at last she
obtained entrance, it was still dark, and she had to
strike a light in order to commence her search.
Everything seemed to conspire to delay her return
to the ship. And, after she had procured a candle,
the object of her search was not to be found. She
looked for it in every place where it should and
where it should not be, but without success. This
consumed many precious moments. At last she abandoned
the matter in despair, thinking that her young
mistress must have the watch about her after all, or
else it had been dropped on the way to the ship.
After securing the house again, she made what haste
she could to the wharf. But what was her amazement
and despair at seeing no sign remaining of the
good ship on board of which all her treasures were
embarked!</p>

<p>She could not at first believe her eyes, and she
stood for some time in mute astonishment. But
before long her mind received a distinct impression
of the dreadful truth, and she made the air resound
with her shrieks and lamentations. She flew distractedly
up and down the wharf, imploring to be
taken on board some of the transports destined for
the same port; but no one had any leisure to attend
to her. It was in the height of the hurry of the
embarkation, and ship after ship was dropping down
with the tide, and making what haste they might to
Nantasket Roads. Almost immediately after Ph&oelig;be
had left the ship, orders came down directing her to

<!-- v2 page 317 -->

get under way directly, and she was already out of
sight. She remained on the wharf in a state but little
removed from distraction, renewing her entreaties
to all she met for assistance in regaining her master's
party. But all the reply she received was curses, and
orders to mind her own business and to get out of
the way. Exhausted at length by her exertions, and
finding there was no hope for her, she returned in
agony of mind to the deserted house in King Street.
There, in solitude and despair, flung upon her face on
the nearest sofa, she lay for hours, weeping as one
that refused to be comforted. The merry peals of the
bells, and the distant sound of military music, might
have told her that General Washington and his victorious
army were making their triumphal entry into
the town; but she neither heard nor heeded them.
Her heart and her eyes were following the stout
ship which was bearing away from her, probably for
ever, the friends of her childhood and the lover of
her youth.</p>

<p>In this state she continued for four and twenty
successive hours. But, after the first paroxysm of
grief and despair had exhausted itself, Ph&oelig;be was
not of a nature to abandon herself to fruitless repinings.
It was fortunate for her that it was necessary
to take some immediate measures for her own
support; for the poor girl was now in a singularly
unfortunate predicament. She absolutely belonged
to nobody. The imperfect legislation of those primitive
days had not provided for such a case of destitution.

<!-- v2 page 318 -->

Had she had the luck to live in these times,
in the Southern States, such an anomaly could not
have occurred. There, the abeyance of the abandoned
property in herself would have been terminated in
favor of the fortunate finder; or at worst it would
have resulted to the State. But in those days, before
political economy, she was suffered to escheat to herself.
And so she had nobody to take care of her.
Thanks, however, to the thorough breeding she had
received in Mr. Mallory's house, she was able to command
at once her choice of the best services in the
town; and she was soon as comfortably situated as
she could be under her unhappy circumstances.</p>

<p>The long years of the war, of course, cut off all
definite intelligence of the Mallorys and of Ambrose.
And the longer years of the peace which followed it
brought little more satisfactory information about
them. All that was certain was, that Mr. Mallory
had been provided for by an appointment in Antigua,
and it was taken for granted that he had proceeded
thither with his family. The humble Ambrose, of
course, had no share in these imperfect advices, and
Ph&oelig;be was left to guess at his fate as best she
might. The Mallorys left no relatives behind them in
the Province, and all interest in them or their affairs
soon died away. There was but one humble heart in
which they occupied all the room that was not before
engrossed by Ambrose their slave.</p>

<p>Meanwhile more than thirty years rolled away
since the emigration. Ph&oelig;be was become a prosperous

<!-- v2 page 319 -->

woman. She had been for some years retired
from service, and had invested her earnings in a small
confectioner's shop, which was well frequented by
those who respected the excellence of her character
and of her pastry. She had never married, though
not unsought, but still remained constant to the memory
of Ambrose; though she had for many years
abandoned all hope of ever seeing or hearing of him
again.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as she was sitting sewing behind
her counter, a man entered her shop. His dress was
sordid and travel-stained, and he walked with difficulty,
supported by a rough stick. He stood with
his back to the light, so that Ph&oelig;be could not see
his features distinctly. He stood, and gazed long
and earnestly in her face. She grew alarmed, and
asked his business. In the act of replying, he shifted
his position, so that the setting sun shone full upon
him. She started from her seat, shrieked, and fell
senseless upon the floor.</p>

<p>"I dropped," to use her own words, "as if I was
shot." It was Ambrose himself, come in the flesh
to claim her at last. Happily, joy is not a mortal
disease, or Ph&oelig;be might not have survived to tell
me her story. Water was at hand, and she soon
opened her eyes upon the face of him whom she had
loved so long and well. It was changed indeed.
Years of slavery had not passed over his head with
out leaving furrows on the brow, and wrinkles on the
cheek. But still it was <i>his</i> face, and that was all she

<!-- v2 page 320 -->

asked. Time and ill usage had grizzled his hair, and
bent his broad shoulders; but to her eyes he was
still young, for she saw him with the eyes of her
heart.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say whether pleasure or pain
predominated in that first interview. But it was not
long before they knew that they were happy. Ph&oelig;be
took Ambrose to her house, fed, clothed, and nursed
him, and finally married him. And though their
union was late, and did not continue long, it was as
happy a marriage as ever knit two hearts in one.</p>

<p>The story of Ambrose, when he was able to tell it,
was simple and common enough. He had followed
his master from Halifax to London, and from London
to Antigua. There Mr. Mallory died. The young
ladies married, and returned to England; and the sons
took to bad courses, and died not long after their
father. Ambrose was taken in execution for a debt
of the last of them, and sold to a Jamaica planter.
In Jamaica he suffered for many years the horrors of
sugar-making, aggravated by the contrast of the easy
service of his previous life. A few months before,
he was sent to Kingston with a load of sugar, and,
finding a vessel on the point of sailing for New York,
he concealed himself on board, and succeeded in effecting
his escape. Arrived in New York, he begged
his way to Boston, being detained on the road by a
fever, caused by the sudden change of climate, and
arrived footsore, weary, and sick at heart, little expecting
the happiness that awaited him.</p>

<!-- v2 page 321 -->

<p>Before long, Ambrose grew weary of the town, and,
as his health had never been good since his return
home, Ph&oelig;be sold her shop, and bought the cottage
in which I found her. Here they supported themselves
comfortably enough for the few years that
Ambrose lived. But the hard winters of New England
were too much for the constitution of one so
long accustomed to the climate of the tropics. He
died of a consumption, lovingly watched over and
tenderly mourned by his faithful Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Such is a plain narrative of the incidents of her
life, which I gathered from Ph&oelig;be Mallory in the
course of my acquaintance with her. I think that
they might have been invested with a good deal of
romantic interest, had they fallen into the right
hands. But such as I have I give unto you.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be always averred that she was the last surviving
slave in the State; and, as I could not contradict
her, I was willing to believe that it was so. I
confess it increased my interest in her, and made
me look upon her in some sort as an historical character.
And I could not but think of the day when
the last American slave will excite a feeling in the
breast of some future inquirer somewhat analogous
to that created by the sight of the last mouldering
fragment of the Bastille. May that day soon arrive!</p>

<p>Several years ago I removed from the city, and lost
sight of poor Ph&oelig;be. Not long since, having a leisure
day in town, I felt strongly moved to go and see

<!-- v2 page 322 -->

if she were yet alive. Yielding to the impulse, I
took the well-remembered road that led by her hut.
But it had vanished away, and in its place stood a
fine Gothic cottage with an Egyptian entablature at
one end supported by four fluted Doric pillars. I
knew at the first glance that it would be of no avail
to inquire after my old friend at such a structure as
this. So I continued my stroll till I came to the
village, about two miles off. There I inquired of
the first man I happened to meet, whether he knew
anything of the fate of Ph&oelig;be Mallory. I was in
luck in my man; for he chanced to be none other
than good master Sexton himself. With the cheerful
solemnity which marks his calling, he informed
me that she had died about three years before, and
was buried in the churchyard over against which we
stood. I asked him to show me her grave, which he
did with professional alacrity. It is the third grave
beyond the elm-tree, on your right hand as you enter
the gate, next the wall.</p>

<p>I could not but feel a sense of satisfaction, mingled
with regret at the loss of my good old friend, to think
that the last relic of Massachusetts slavery lay buried
beneath my feet. I felt proud of my native State for
what she had done as a State to mark her aversion
to slavery; and I hoped that the time was not far
distant when she would brush aside the cobweb ties
which prevent her from telling the hunter of men in
yet more emphatic tones that her fields are no hunting-grounds
for him.</p>

<!-- v2 page 323 -->

<p>I have no taste for monumental memorials, as a
general thing. At least, I see no fitness in attempting
to preserve the memory of mediocrity or obscurity
by monuments whose very permanence is a
satire on the forgotten names they bear. But I have
no quarrel with the feeling which prompts men to
mark with marble the ground where the truly great
repose, or to record the resting-place of humbler
merit when it is fairly invested with some just historic
interest. Of this latter class I esteem the grave
of Ph&oelig;be Mallory. And I shall think it neither
absurd nor extravagant, if, within a few months, a
plain white marble slab should be found marking the
spot where she lies, with an inscription somewhat to
this effect:&mdash;</p>

<h2>OLD HOUSES.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I LOVE an old house. Even though its walls,
battered and decayed, speak of nothing but poverty
and toil, still there is something touching in
the thought of the tide of human passions and human
affections which have flowed through it; of the happy
marriages, the joyous childhood, the cheerful age,
which it has sheltered; of the many spirits which
it has beheld beginning the strife of being, which,
after enduring the labor and heat of the longest
of life's days, have gone to their eternal home, of
whose existence not a single trace remains in any
mind on earth. It is not necessary that the many
centuries which are required in older countries to
invest the habitations of man with the venerable
dignity of old age should have swept over its threshold
and its hearthstone to sanctify to my heart one
of those quaint constructions which I love to people
anew with the beings of a vanished generation. All
I ask is, that it should speak to me of the past, of the
forgotten.</p>

<p>It is my delight to take my solitary walk through
those streets of our city which have suffered least

<!-- v2 page 328 -->

from the levelling hand of modern improvement.
I eschew, as I would an infected district, that mushroom
growth of human habitations which has climbed
the airy heights of West Boston, and filled up its
pleasant valleys, where in my boyhood I used to play,
with a profane load of brick and mortar. But where
Washington Street extends its tortuous length, and
where the North End displays her labyrinthine maze
of narrow lanes and alleys,&mdash;now, alas! with a pitiful
ambition, all erected into streets, as every petty
prince must nowadays, forsooth, be a king,&mdash;there,
to the mind of a true lover of bygone days, the spirit
of the past broods as sensibly as over the most ancient
metropolis of Europe. What matters it to him,
that the din of busy life is in his ears, that he is jostled
at every turn by eager traffickers, and that his escape
with life from the thundering throng of drays and
stage-coaches is a standing miracle? He hears not
the uproar; the bustle disturbs not him; his eyes are
with his heart, in the good old days when schoolboys
played unmolested in what are now the busiest thoroughfares.
Visions of fine old men, in a costume
worthy of the dignity of men, and gorgeous dames
worthy of the men they loved, float before his mental
sight. He walks in the midst of a generation which
now lives on earth only on the canvas of Copley,
where their brocades and satins still rustle, and their
faces still beam with the bloom of immortality. The
old walls around him are still vocal with the mirth
and gladness of households which many a sorrow has

<!-- v2 page 329 -->

chastened, with the frolic laugh of children who have
long since reached&mdash;faint pilgrims!&mdash;the utmost
boundary of human existence, and gladly laid down
the load of life in the still chambers of the tomb.
Friendly faces look kindly upon him from the casements;
sweet though solemn voices tell him of the
days gone by, and remind him that the century
that will comprise the lives of all his contemporaries
is hastening on rapid wings to join the ages
before the flood, and that the hour will soon be here
when the memory of him and his will be swallowed
up in the advancing tide of coming ages, as a drop
of rain melts into the ocean. The roofs under which
our fathers lived and died are full of instruction:
they teach us a lesson, mournful, yet pleasant to the
soul, of the brevity of human life and the uncertainty
of human hopes.</p>

<p>This edifice before us is but of yesterday, as it
were; and yet who laid the corner-stone? Who
counted the cost, and thought he was undertaking
a work of mighty moment? Where are the hands
that reared the pile, and brought daily bread to their
children from their daily toil? Where is she who
first established within its boundaries the gentle
sway of domestic government? Perhaps she passed
over its threshold a smiling, tearful bride, casting a
lingering look behind at the happy home she had
left, yet regarding the one before her with the hopeful
confidence of a woman's heart. Where are the
troops of friends which flocked to its portals with

<!-- v2 page 330 -->

cheerful looks and hearty congratulations? Where
are the children, in whose promise and success hearts
were garnered up? They have all departed from the
earth. To us they are as if they had never been.
One after another their funeral processions have
blackened the streets. For each, in succession, have
human hearts refused to be comforted, and for a
season thought that the sun would never shine on
them again as it used to do, until time and care and
fresh griefs plucked from the bosom the sorrow which
seemed to be rooted there forever. One by one the
actors who played their parts on this little stage
have withdrawn from the scene, and the curtain long
since dropped, when the last lagging veteran retired,
and the drama was ended.</p>

<p>But although I love an old house in itself, for its
own sake, and independently of any specific associations,
yet in a special manner do I delight in the
dwellings of my old familiar friends, whose faces are
familiar to my eye, whose characters are dear to
my heart, whose various fates are as present to me
as my own personal history. Mistake me not. I
do not mean any of the round-hatted, frock-coated,
breeches-less generation which now encumber the
streets. I care but little for this stereotyped edition
of humanity, all bound alike, and not differing
much in the nature and value of their contents, like
the washy concoctions of some knowledge-diffusing
society.</p>

<p>No, no! I refer to times when "Nature's copy"

<!-- v2 page 331 -->

wore a dress which spoke to you of the meaning it
contained, as in some solemn library the tomes</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Which Aldus printed, or Du Sueil has bound,"</p>

</div>

<p>tell you, even before you open them, of the classic
mind within.</p>

<p>Too few, alas! of these abodes, consecrated by the
memory of departed worth, have escaped the ruthless
hands of the money-lovers of this age, who regard
one of my dear old houses as only so much improvable
real estate, and who think of nothing, when they
gaze on its time-honored walls, but how much the old
materials will bring. The good old class of "garden-houses,"
in which it is recorded that Milton always
chose to live, is now almost as entirely extinct here
as in London itself.</p>

<p>How well do I remember one of these, in which
some of my happiest days and merriest nights were
spent! It stood with its end to the street, overshadowed
by a magnificent elm of aboriginal growth,
which made strange and solemn music in my boyish
ears when the autumn winds called forth its hidden
harmonies at midnight. Entering the gate, you proceeded
on a flagged walk, having the house close to
you on your left, and on your right the courtyard,
filled with "flowers of all hues," and fragrant shrubs,
each forming the mathematical centre of an exact
circle cut in the velvet greensward. When within
the front-door, you had on your left hand the best
parlor, opened only on high solemnities, and which

<!-- v2 page 332 -->

used to excite in my young mind a mysterious feeling
of mingled curiosity and awe whenever I stole a
glance at its darkened interior, with its curiously
carved mahogany chairs black as ebony with age,
its blue damask curtains, the rare piece of tapestry
which served as a carpet&mdash;all reflected in the tall
mirror, with its crown and sceptred top, between the
windows. I remember it used to put me in mind of
the fatal blue chamber in Bluebeard. I am not sure
now that there was not something supernatural about
it.</p>

<p>But it was the parlor opposite that was the very
quintessence of snugness and comfort, worth half a
hundred fantastic boudoirs and modern drawing-rooms
bedizened with French finery. On your right hand
as you entered were two windows opening upon the
courtyard above commemorated, with their convenient
window-seats&mdash;an accommodation which I sadly
miss&mdash;with their appropriate green velvet cushions, a
little the worse for wear. On the opposite side of the
room to the windows was a glass door opening into
the garden, a pleasant sight to see, with its rectangular
box-lined gravel walks, its abundant vegetables,
its luxuriant fruit-trees, its vine trained over the
stable-wall. As you returned to the house through
the garden-door, you had on your right the door of a
closet with a window looking into the garden, which
was entitled the study, having been appropriated to
that purpose by the deceased master of the house.
This recess possessed substantial charms to my infant

<!-- v2 page 333 -->

imagination as the perennial fountain of cakes and
apples, which my good aunt&mdash;of whom presently&mdash;conducted
in a never-failing stream to the never-satisfied
mouth of an urchin of six years old. I
thought they grew there by some spontaneous process
of reproduction.</p>

<p>A little farther on, nearer to the study-door than
the one by which we entered, was the fireplace, fit
shrine for the Penates of such a household; its ample
circumference adorned with Dutch tiles, where stout
shepherdesses in hoops and high-heeled shoes gave
sidelong looks of love to kneeling swains in cocked
hats and trunk-hose; while their dogs and sheep had
grown so much alike from long intimacy as to be
scarcely distinguishable. How I loved those little
glimpses into pastoral life! I have one of them now,
which I rescued from the wreck of matter when the
house came down. Within the ample jaws of the
chimney, which might have swallowed up at a mouthful
a century of patent grates, crackled and roared the
merry wood fire,&mdash;fed with massy logs which it would
take two men to lift, as men are now,&mdash;casting
its cheerful light as evening drew in on the panelled
walls, bringing out the curious "<i>egg-and-anchor</i>"
carvings, which were my special pride and wonder,
and flashing back from the mirror globe which depended
from the beam which divided the comfortable
low ceiling into two unequal parts. And let me not
forget the mantelpiece, adorned with grotesque heads
in wood, and clusters of fruit and flowers, of

<!-- v2 page 334 -->

which Grinling Gibbons himself need not have been
ashamed. And then the Turkey carpet, covering the
breadth, but not the length, of the room; and the
books,&mdash;the "Spectator's" short face in his title-page,
the original "Tatler," the first editions of Pope.
But time would fail me were I to record all the well-remembered
contents of that dear old room,&mdash;the
sofa or settee, of narrow capacity, looking as if three
single chairs had been rolled into one; the card-table,
with its corners for candles, and its pools for fish
scooped out of the verdant champain of green broad
cloth. But enough: let us now approach the divinity
whose penetralia we have entered, and who well
befits such a shrine.</p>

<p>In an elbow-chair at the right of the fireplace, sat
my excellent aunt, Mrs. Margaret Champion, widow
of the Honorable John Champion, long one of his
Majesty's Council for this Province. When I first
remember her, she had passed her seventieth year,
and she lived in a green old age till near a hundred
winters had passed over her head. What a picture of
serene and beautiful old age! Her placid countenance,
which a cheerful piety and constitutional philosophy
had kept almost unwrinkled; her large black eyes, in
which the fires of youth were not yet wholly extinguished;
the benevolent smile which was seldom
absent from her lips&mdash;spoke of a frame on which
Time had laid a gentle hand, and of a mind at ease.
When I knew her, the profane importunities of the
fairer part of her relatives had obtained a reluctant

<!-- v2 page 335 -->

consent to abandon the gently swelling hoop and lowering
crape cushion in which she once rejoiced. But
you could never have seen how she became her decent
white lace cap, her flowing black lace <i>shade</i>, her rich
silks for common wear, and her stiff brocades for
high solemnities, and not have known that she was a
gentlewoman born.</p>

<p>I attribute a good deal of my love of other days to
the short winter afternoons and long winter evenings
which I sometimes spent alone with her. I say <i>sometimes</i>,
for she was not one of the instances of neglected
old age; but her society was courted by
young as well as old.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"The general favorite as the general friend."</p>

</div>

<p>My aunt Champion was born not long after the
commencement of the last century, and remembered
Governor Dudley. The succeeding inhabitants of the
old Province House were familiar to her recollection,
from Colonel Shute down to Sir Francis Bernard.
She was a stanch Tory, God bless her! and loved
the king to her dying day, and thought that no
greater men ever lived, at least on this continent,
than his Majesty's representatives in the Province.
How well would she touch off the characters of the
successive Excellencies who in turn did penance in
the unthankful office of provincial governor! With
what skill (though all unconscious of any) would she
individualize them, and bring them body and soul
before your eyes!&mdash;Shute, with his military bluntness

<!-- v2 page 336 -->

and frank sincerity, relieved by a little of the subacidity
of temper which distinguished Mr. Shandy,
and rather too much aptitude to go off at half-cock;
Burnet, mild and gentlemanlike, fond of pleasure and
of elegant letters, and intended by nature and education
for a wider and more brilliant sphere, and whose
gentle nature was not made of stubborn stuff enough
to bear up against the perpetual dropping of the
petty vexations which he encountered in his official
duties, and the dislike with which his genial propensities
were regarded by the sterner religionists of the
day. I think that he was my aunt's favorite; but
then his reign was contemporary with her own, and
she looked upon him and his court with the eyes of
eighteen. Then came Belcher, plain, serious, dignified,
whose appearance and conversation indicated a
sound judgment and a cultivated mind, but whose
character, though acceptable to the colonists as one
of themselves, and of interests identical with their
own, did not find equal favor with his predecessor in
the eyes of a lively young woman who loved to hear
of the court of Anne and George, and of the brilliant
constellation of wits which shed its selectest influences
in that period of Burnet's life when he was the
chosen companion of Addison, Pope, Steele, and Congreve.
Next appeared the elegant, versatile Shirley,
intelligent, graceful, full of nice tact, which stood
him in good stead in his public as well as private life.
He was the only one of the colonial governors who
so laid the course of the ship of state as to avail

<!-- v2 page 337 -->

himself both of the tide of royal favor and of the
shifting gales of the popular breath, and to keep the
helm for nearly eighteen years. His was a glorious
reign too.</p>

<p>During his supremacy, Louisburg fell,&mdash;an event
ever memorable in New England history. With
what interest would my good aunt describe the intense
anxiety which filled every heart while the fate
of the expedition was uncertain! and then the transports
of joy with which the news of its complete and
almost unhoped for success was received, the sermons,
the illuminations, the oxen roasted whole, the
oceans of punch, the broached hogsheads of wine;
for in those days temperance societies were not.
Mrs. Champion looked upon this victory as totally
eclipsing all the military glories of the Revolutionary
War, and indeed it was not surpassed by any
single action of that great struggle: as for Sir William
Pepperell, why, General Washington was a fool
to him.</p>

<p>Then came Pownal, gay, hearty, jovial, whose brilliant
balls and gay dinners almost made my dear
aunt forgive his leaning to the popular side. His
festivity of temper and the gay coterie with which
he had surrounded himself made her sorry, I am
sure, though she would never admit it, when he was
removed to make way for the less accommodating
nature of Sir Francis Bernard, whose saturnine temperament
and impracticable temper made him a suitable
lever in the hands of an infatuated ministry to

<!-- v2 page 338 -->

detach entirely and forever the American Continent
from the British Empire.</p>

<p>Then how many tales she had to tell of pre-revolutionary
festivities, of the old aristocratic families,
too many of which are now extinct, or scattered by
the Revolutionary storm over foreign lands! And
again: there were sadder stories of later days,&mdash;the
bitter scenes which preceded the flight of the Tories
from their native land, when they stood, a small
phalanx, surrounded by a host of the bitterest foes,
filled with a jealousy and hatred even surpassing
that of warring brothers; and when, the cruelest of
all, the flame of discord raged in almost every family,
destroying all the charities of domestic life, and alienating
fathers from sons, and daughters from mothers.
And then, when the confident hope which they had
entertained, of the power of the British Government
to protect them, at last failed them; when the report&mdash;at
first disbelieved, and more dreadful than the rebel
cannon&mdash;was confirmed, that the town was to be
evacuated; what consternation filled all their hearts!
To stay would be to encounter the rage of the rebels
flushed with victory: to fly, perhaps forever, from
all the scenes they loved best, would be to leave their
estates to certain confiscation, and to reduce themselves
to a miserable dependence on the precarious
bounty of the British king. What agonies of indecision,
what years of suffering, were crowded into those
few hours! what heart-breakings, when the most obnoxious
resolved on flight! what leave-takings of

<!-- v2 page 339 -->

parents and children, of brothers and sisters, of husbands
and wives! what partings&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Such as press<br/>

The life from out young hearts."</p>

<p>of the beloved and the betrothed!&mdash;some, alas! never
to meet again, and others not till years of sorrow and of
hope deferred had changed their countenances, and
perhaps chilled their hearts.</p>

<p>Then she would tell melancholy tales of how the
condition of the refugees was changed from that
palmy state which their better days had known, of
the neglect they encountered, of the poverty they
endured; some of them long lingering out a sordid
existence in obscure parts of London on the pittance
which their royal master allowed them, buried in the
utter solitude of a great city; some ending their
days in the King's Bench; the most fortunate passing
the rest of their lives in an honorable exile, in
some petty official station in the pestilential climate
of a sugar island.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is from the sympathy
which naturally springs from the contemplation of
great reverses in private life, when we are far enough
removed from the distorting passions of contemporaries,
or whether it is that I caught the infection of
my good aunt's enthusiasm, still, though I reverence
the fathers of our liberty, and am on principle of the
Revolutionary side, I must confess that I do love
the Tories. I am glad that I was not old enough at

<!-- v2 page 340 -->

that time to take an active part on either side of the
divisions that then rent society asunder&mdash;for I am
afraid that I should have been a Whig.</p>

<p>Mrs. Champion herself was bound to the soil by
too many ties of offspring and kindred to be able to
break away. And happy for her it was, or perhaps
she would have died of a broken, homesick heart,
like her sister, or perished beneath the sun of Jamaica,
like her two brothers, instead of attaining a happy
old age, attended with all that should accompany it,
honored even by those who abhorred her loyalty.</p>

<p>The mention of my dear old aunt has led me far
away from my theme; but it is hard to check the
procession of images which her name conjures up to
my imagination. Let us return to the present day,
and contemplate one or two of the yet surviving
localities of her happier hours, and mourn over those
that have vanished.</p>

<p>The old Province House&mdash;for about a century
the centre of that world which was comprehended
within the bounds of Massachusetts Bay&mdash;still
stands; but how shorn of its beams! After passing
through a variety of evil fortunes, it is now an
eating-house; and those apartments which a century
ago beheld the assembled wisdom, wit, and
beauty of the Province, and witnessed the elegant
hospitality of the foremost man of all that little
world, now see nothing but greasy citizens, impatient
for their dinner, or clamorous for their grog.
It still bears some traces of its better days in the

<!-- v2 page 341 -->

iron railings, the freestone steps, and some of the
ornaments of its front. It has the air of some
ancient gentleman, who, after spending his youth
and manhood in a sphere suited to his rank, is reduced
in his old age to some unworthy, perhaps
menial, condition: whatever may be his employment,
and however dilapidated his dress, you feel
that he is not in his right place. The old Indian,
too, still bends his bow above its roof, and not without
his legend, which used to tell my wondering
boyhood that at midnight, just as the clock struck
twelve, the bowstring twanged, and the shaft sped
away into unknown worlds,&mdash;whither, I neither
asked nor cared. I troubled not my head with sceptical
inquiries into mysteries which are the province
of unseen powers. Its ample courtyard, which had
beheld many a military and many a civil pomp, has
been long since filled up with a staring row of
vulgar modern brick houses, presuming, like some
upstarts newly rich, to turn their backs upon their
betters. An envious screen! And yet I do not
know but that it is now more pleasing to the genius
of the place to have its wreck of former greatness
thus shielded from the common gaze. I think it
may save the stout old walls some blushes.</p>

<p>Reader, be pleased to exercise at my bidding that
wonder-working power which we all possess, and
sweep away that mass of brick and mortar, replant
the noble trees, and restore the fine old pile to its
pristine splendor. Conjure up the men and boys of

<!-- v2 page 342 -->

a hundred years ago, and, as you love me, forget
not the women. It is a lovely day in June. All
the world is abroad. The country seems to be superinduced
upon the town. It must be some special
holiday. It is, indeed, the greatest of the year,
always saving and excepting Commencement. It is
the feast of the ANCIENT AND HONORABLE ARTILLERY
COMPANY, the most ancient military institution in
the United States, and which was regarded at its
creation with a jealous eye by our prudent ancestors,
forewarned by the example "of the Pr&aelig;torian Band
among the Romans and the Knights-Templars in
Europe." There they are, drawn up martially before
the gate, ready to take up the escort. Their presence
has just been intimated to the Governor. The door
opens, and, surrounded by a splendid cortege, his
Excellency appears. Observe his collarless scarlet
coat, richly laced with gold, his embroidered white
satin waistcoat, his scarlet breeches, white silk stockings,
high quartered shoes and gold buckles, and
neglect not to remark the cut steel handle of his
dress-sword. Mark with what an old-school grace
he takes up his cocked hat, and advances bowingly
forwards in acknowledgment of the lowered pikes,
presented firelocks, and rolling drums of the citizen
soldiers, and the hearty shouts of the gazing crowd.
Would that time would serve us to follow the procession
to the Old Brick, and listen to a sermon
containing matter enough to furnish forth a century
of the delicate discourses of our times! Thence we

<!-- v2 page 343 -->

might repair to the well-spread board; and, when
those rites have been duly solemnized, we might
accompany them to the Common, and witness, with
a generation long vanished, the ceremonies of the
pomp and circumstance of which we have now but
a type. And then the brilliant evening, when his
Excellency threw open his doors to a polished and
elegant circle unsurpassed at any subsequent period!
But something too much of this.</p>

<p>It is about four years since I took a melancholy
walk to the North End, to take a last farewell of one
of the few historical houses which then survived. I
mean the mansion of Governor Hutchinson, a man
whose name will by degrees lose much of the odium
with which the unfortunate view which he took of the
interests of his country has invested it, and whose
faults will be thought, perhaps, by posterity, to have
been expiated by his misfortunes. When I arrived,
the hand of destruction was already there. The house
was disembowelled, the windows gone, and the whole
scene presented an air of desolation which would have
transported a less vivid imagination than mine to the
morning&mdash;seventy years since&mdash;which succeeded the
night, disgraceful in our annals, when a brutal and
inebriated mob made a ruin of the finest house in the
Province, and, what was worse, destroyed collections
for the loss of which our history must ever mourn.
The political magicians of that day, who foresaw the
tempest which was brewing, and thought that they
could so direct the storm as to produce only the good

<!-- v2 page 344 -->

effects of a wholesome agitation of the political atmosphere,
found, too late, that in fostering the mob-spirit
they had evoked a devil which they could neither
control nor lay, and which, once raised, seems like to
become the master of their descendants. It will be
many years before we shall see another house at all
comparable to this one of the last age, either in its
architectural excellence, or the substantial elegance of
its internal economy.</p>

<p>From the ruins of this edifice and those of one
other adjoining house of one of the old Tory families&mdash;which
well deserves a separate essay for its description&mdash;have
sprung a crop of SIXTEEN fine new brick
houses, all stark alike, as if they had been run in the
same mould, meaningless, soulless masses of matter.
How heavily must their weight lie upon his soul who
effected the change! I would not have such a load
on my conscience for the world.</p>

<p>Another venerable monument of a former generation
has since bowed its head in the dust, and given
place also to a crowd of upstart heirs, who perk their
commonplace, vulgar visages in your face as if they
were of better worth than the noble ancestral stock
from which they sprung. It was the residence of Sir
William Phipps. That "fair brick house in the Green
Lane of North Boston," which, before the tide of his
affairs had turned, he prophetically boasted to his unbelieving
spouse that he would one day possess, is forever
gone; and the fine old height, from which it once
proudly surveyed the country round, is the abode of a

<!-- v2 page 345 -->

brick-and-mortar monster, compared with which the
gerrymander was grace and proportion itself. This
stately house, to which the adventurous boy had
looked forward as the summit of human hopes when
he was keeping sheep at Casco Bay, or wielding the
adze and the hammer in one of the shipyards of Boston,
was completed after his extraordinary enterprise
had been crowned with remarkable success, when the
hand of majesty had laid the honor of knighthood on
his shoulder, and the poor journeyman mechanic had
returned to his native land invested with its highest
dignity. It is well that corporations have no souls,
or I fear that the one which delivered up this last
stronghold of the past into the hands of the Philistines
would stand in fearful peril of utter perdition.</p>

<p>There is, however, still standing an abode of less
aristocratic pretensions, but of more illustrious associations,
than those just celebrated. It is the house in
which Benjamin Franklin spent his early years. It
makes the corner of Hanover and Union Streets on
your right hand as you go towards the North End
from Court Street, and may be distinguished by a ball
protruding as a sign, with the date 1698. I have
somewhere seen a letter from Doctor Franklin, in
which he says that he was born in this house; but
accurate antiquarians who have carefully investigated
the subject are of opinion that his father did not remove
to this house till after the Doctor's birth; which
they assert took place in a house (now, of course,
demolished) which stood on the site of Barker's furniture

<!-- v2 page 346 -->

warehouse in Milk Street, a little lower down
than the Old South Church, on the other side. However
this may be, whether Milk Street or Hanover
Street may boast of having witnessed the entrance of
the great philosopher on the scene which he so long
adorned, still we may be sure that those unpretending
walls beheld the first dawning of his infant intellect,
and were associated with his earliest recollections.
It was from that door that the self-complacent urchin
issued with his pocket full of coppers on that famous
holiday morning when he exchanged all his treasure
for the ever-memorable whistle, and with it bought
the experience, which, comprised within the compass
of a proverb, he has added to the stock of the world's
wisdom. It was in that cellar, that, in his early
economy of time, he shocked his worthy progenitor
by proposing to have grace said in the lump over the
whole barrel of beef which he was putting down,
instead of over each piece in detail as it came to the
table. Here, too, it was, that his father, patriarch-like,
sat at his table surrounded by thirteen grown-up children;
of which numerous race I believe there is not
a single descendant extant, certainly not of the name.
It was to this home, too, that young Franklin returned,
after his successful elopement to Philadelphia, with a
fine coat upon his back, and money in his pocket
the admiration of his parents and the envy of his
brethren. If walls had tongues as well as ears, what
histories might not these unfold! Reader, if you are
worthy to look upon this hallowed scene, make haste,

<!-- v2 page 347 -->

delay not your pilgrimage till to-morrow, nor even
till after dinner; for, even while I write, its fate may
be sealed and its destruction begun. In other countries
the roofs which have sheltered less eminent men
than Benjamin Franklin are preserved with filial reverence,
and visited with pilgrim devotion. It should
be so here.</p>

<p>Both time and patience would fail me if I were to
recount at large the other deeds of destruction which
have been worked out within a few years past. The
mansion-house of the Faneuils, with its princely
courtyard and old French palace-like front, with the
grotesque heads grinning from the tops of the windows;
the house of the Vassalls, the headquarters
of Lord Percy during the siege, and afterwards the
abode of Mrs. Hayley, the sister of John Wilkes,
with its hanging-gardens terraced to the summit of
one of the original peaks of old Trimountain; the
hospitable home of the Bowdoins, eloquent of the
past&mdash;they are all vanished. The very soil on
which they stood is removed, and cast into the sea.</p>

<p>I have lived long, and seen many changes. The
friends of my early years are mostly cold, either in
death or in estrangement. The grand-daughters of
my early loves now reign in their stead. The world
is governed by a generation yet unborn when my
career of active life began. I have seen heresies in
politics and in religion usurp the rightful supremacy
of the good old orthodox platform. I have witnessed
the decline of hoops, the desuetude of powder, the

<!-- v2 page 348 -->

almost total extinction of breeches. The last of the
cocked hats, too, has set forever, and is, like the lost
Pleiad, "seen no more below." I have beheld divinest
punch driven forth from the society of polite
man, and forced to take refuge in the grogshops.
Even Madeira's generous juice have I seen elbowed
aside by pretending coxcombs from the south of
France and the Rhine. But stay! I take back the
disparaging epithet. One is too apt to undervalue the
merits of newer friends when they interfere with the
modest claims of long-tried and well-known worth.
I will not be unjust to the newer excellence of</p>

<p class="small">"The gay, serene, good-natured Burgundy,<br/>

And the fresh fragrant vintage of the Rhine;"</p>

<p>but surely, surely for the solid, serious drinking that
man came into the world to do, Madeira is the only
satisfying good.</p>

<p>All these changes, however, have stolen so gradually
upon me, that my natural and acquired disinclination
to change has not been rudely shocked.
The times have changed, and I have changed with
them. But the violence that is done to my steadfast
nature by the sudden and total demolition of my old
companion walls, the very scenes of my youthful
pleasures, is mitigated by no gradual and stealthy
approach. The pickaxe enters into my soul. The
difficult tug which in the death-grapple can hardly
bring the sturdy old walls to the ground, too roughly
tears the web of remembered joys. I rejoice to think

<!-- v2 page 349 -->

that I shall not remain long enough behind to behold
the utter extinction of all of my old familiar friends.
This roof, at least, under which I write, and which
has sheltered more than four generations of my ancestors,
will remain to be the abode of my age. It
cannot yield to Vandal force until I have exchanged
its friendly shelter for "the house appointed for all
living."</p>

<p>ALL the world knows that the blessings of the
patriarchal system were not always monopolized
by our Southern brethren. New England, also,
once rejoiced in its benign influences. Although the
fathers of New England did not exactly make
"slavery the corner-stone of their republican institutions"
(for the science of political ethics was then
in its infancy), still they were not so fanatical as
wholly to reject it from the fabric of their new State.
The scarcity of laborers in those early days reconciled
some of them to a system, which, when first proposed,
they rejected with abhorrence; and the obvious
convenience of having their work done without
having to pay for it might well help to silence any
fantastic scruples as to the justice of the arrangement.
Others, again, in whom the religious principle
predominated over the economical, thought they
discerned the finger of Providence indicating the
spiritual things which were to be imparted to the
involuntary immigrants in exchange for their carnal

<!-- v2 page 354 -->

things; and they hailed every fresh importation of
African heathens as so much raw material to be
worked up into American Christians, and thus, before
the inception of the foreign or domestic missionary
enterprises, united the benefits of the former plan
with the conveniences of the latter. The privilege
of extending the advantages of modern civilization
and Christianity to these savage and Pagan strangers,
whose experience of both during the middle passage
would favorably prepare them for their reception,
reconciled these good men to any apparent hardship
in the mode of bringing their neophytes within the
sphere of their influences. The happy project of
reshipping them or their descendants to their native
country, after they had been fully saturated with
the blessings of that of their adoption, had not then
been developed, or the philanthropy of their benefactors
would have received a new impulse from the
beatific vision of these new apostles carrying back
the civilization and religion they had learned during
their sojourn in this favored land to that of their
birth; which, if truly reported to their savage countrymen
as preached and practised by the vast
majority of ministers and people of almost every
denomination, could not fail of awakening in their
breasts a holy emulation, and of inducing an instant
renunciation of their favorite barbarisms of
fighting, killing, and enslaving one another. Not
withstanding this disadvantage, our good ancestors
satisfied their consciences as well as they were able,

<!-- v2 page 355 -->

in one way or another, and submitted to be served
without wages with the best grace they could. In
justice to their memories, however, it should be said
that New England slavery was the very mildest
form of involuntary servitude. The nature of the
agricultural and mechanical productions of that day,
the difficult communication and comparatively infrequent
intercourse between the different Colonies, and
the severe morality which marked the character of
that peculiar people, prevented the overworking of
the slaves, the separation of families and disruption
of natural ties, and that toleration, if not compulsion,
of the grossest vice and licentiousness which form
the most hideous features of the system as it exists
at the present day in this country. Tradition relates
that the old slaves often ruled with almost
absolute sway over the farmhouses in which they
had passed their lives, while by the wealthier families
they were frequently indulged more like spoiled
children than favorite domestics. Many circumstances
might be related to show that the value of
"this peculiar species of property" was very different
in those days and these; or else that our fathers were
not the wise men in their generation that they are
reputed to have been. I will only mention the advertisements
which are not unfrequently found in
the curious little newspapers of the times, to this
effect: "TO BE GIVEN AWAY, a likely negro child of
five years old; apply to the printer." Now, among
the many modern slave advertisements which I have

<!-- v2 page 356 -->

consulted, whether in the columns of Southern newspapers
themselves, or when transferred to the collections
of the curious in such matters, as affording the
most indisputable, unimpeachable evidence of the
true character of the system (unless, indeed, it be
true, as was once suggested to me by an elderly
gentleman of respectable appearance in a stage-coach,
that they are inserted in the Southern papers
by the abolitionists, for the purpose of making an
impression at the North), it never has been my fortune
to light upon an advertisement of this description.
Now, as generosity is well known to be the
inseparable companion of chivalry, it cannot be supposed
that the absence of such advertisements is
owing to any lack of a giving spirit. It must be
accounted for either by modesty, which shrinks from
such a parade of liberal designs, or by a change in
the value of the gift, which makes such a proclamation
unnecessary in order to find one willing to accept
it. The reader must settle this point for himself
while I proceed to my <i>historiette</i>.</p>

<p>It was in that world before wages, but towards
the close of those happy days of primitive simplicity,
that our heroine made her first appearance upon this
disjointed scene of things. She was "born," about
seventy years since, "in the house" of Judge Rollins
of Somersworth, N.H.,&mdash;a circumstance, which, we
learn from high authority, brought her as effectually
within the protection of the scriptural sanctions
of slavery as if she had been "bought with

<!-- v2 page 357 -->

his money."<sup>1</sup> If her master happened to be troubled
with any silly scruples about his relation to poor
Dinah and his other slaves, it is a thousand pities
that he lived too soon to enjoy the ghostly consolations
just quoted, and others equally cogent and to
the point; as, for example, the positions recently
maintained by a reverend divine (Rev. E. Fuller of
Beaufort, S.C.), that "the domestic relations here
existing" are authorized by God, not condemned
by Jesus Christ, and "expressly authorized" by the
Holy Ghost; and that consequently their condemnation
by abolitionists is "a direct insult to the
Unchangeable and Holy One of heaven."<sup>2</sup> In default
of such comforters, however, Judge Rollins and
his family appear to have quieted their conscientious
scruples, if they had any, by treating their
slaves in the kindest manner. As long as any of
the family survived, Dinah remained an affectionate
inmate of their household. At length, however, the
Rollins family became extinct, as was the case with
many others of the old New Hampshire families,
which helped to transmute the most aristocratic of the
Colonies into the most democratic of the States; and
poor Dinah was left without anybody to take care of
her. The reader will perhaps conclude from this,

<!-- v2 page 358 -->

her unhappy predicament, that she either immediately
took to begging, if not to stealing, or else
transported her poverty to another State, or at best
came upon the parish. No such consequences ensued,
although we are credibly assured that such
must be the inevitable effects of emancipation. She
migrated no farther than Portsmouth, where she obtained
an honest livelihood by serving as hostler in
a livery-stable.</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>See the passage on this subject in the work on Moral Philosophy
by the Rev. Jasper Adams, D.D., president of the college in
Charleston, S.C.]</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>2</sup>See his Letter to the Rev. Elon Galusha, in the Recorder and
Watchman.]</p>

<p>I apprehend that a less authentic historian than
myself, priding himself on the dignity, rather than
the truth of his narrative, might be tempted to soften
this circumstance, if not to suppress it entirely; for
in the course of a pretty extensive and careful circle
of studies, including most of the Annuals and Souvenirs
of the last dozen years, and other kindred
branches of literature, I do not remember to have read
of a single heroine, whatever might have been the
extremity or the variety of her distress, who was
reduced to rub down horses, and sweep out stables,
for her support. I am apprehensive, too, lest my
Dinah should seem to some masters in our Israel to
have been "impatient of her proper sphere," and
to have "stepped forth to assume the duties of the
man" in her choice of a field of labor; and that she
may even come within the range of the fulminations
of the Pastoral Letter of the Massachusetts General
Association of Congregational Ministers, and be exposed
to be likened unto "a vine, whose strength
and beauty is to lean upon the trellis-work, and half

<!-- v2 page 359 -->

conceal its clusters," but which "thinks to assume
the independence and overshadowing nature of the
elm." I am concerned, also, lest a distinguished
gentleman who stands in the first rank, if not in
the first place, of our Republic of Letters, and who
has lately discoursed eloquently to an elegant audience
on the sphere of woman, or some of his
admirers (should this little story fall under the observation
of any of them), may condemn her as
deficient in that perfect propriety and feminine delicacy,
which form the chief ornaments of the sex.
My business, however, is to relate facts, and not to
extenuate them, and I must leave poor Dinah to
the mercy of all censors, whether clerical or laic,
who may choose to sit in judgment upon her. I
must, in justice, however, state, that, great as may
have been her deviation in this particular from the
gentle elegancies and graceful proprieties of perfect
womanhood, it was not owing to anything unfeminine
in her education. I am not sure that she is even
possessed of those elements of reading and writing,
which, according to Dogberry, "come by nature;"
and I think that I can assure the fastidious reader
that she is perfectly innocent of the knowledge of
the classics, of metaphysics, of the higher mathematics,
and, in general, of all the eminently masculine
branches of learning.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the opinion of the learned, or
of posterity, as to the abstract fitness of Dinah's position
in the livery-stable, there she was when the

<!-- v2 page 360 -->

circumstance occurred which I have thought worthy
of recital. While she was thus engaged in the
charge of steeds, an occupation for which I forgot in
the proper place to say she had the example of the
Homeric princesses and of the dames of chivalry,
she was one day accosted by a white woman who
had once lived at service with her, and who told a
piteous tale. She had spent a long life in menial
service, and after having drudged for many years,
and endured the caprices and exactions of many
masters, she was now in her old age, and when disabled
from labor by infirmity, thrown destitute upon
the world. No resource seemed left her but the
alms-house, for which she entertained the dread
so common to honest poverty, and which seems to
argue some vice in the system, which cannot be entirely
subdued, even when it is administered in the
most humane and enlightened manner. It was a
common tale, and of every-day distress, such as would
excite but little attention at the corners of the streets;
but it went straight to the good heart of Dinah.
Here was an old friend in want, and what could she
do for her? When the heart is opened to receive a
friend in distress, the door does not long remain
closed. If the heart is large enough, the house
is seldom found too small. Accordingly, Dinah
soon remembered that her habitation, though small
enough for one, was still large enough for two. And
as for the increased expenses of her establishment&mdash;why,
she must work the harder to meet them,

<!-- v2 page 361 -->

that was all. Her plan was soon arranged in her
mind, and as speedily reduced to practice. She took
her old companion to her humble home, and has
ever since (it is now several years) shared it and
all that it contains with her. So little did she think
that she had done anything out of the common way,
that it was a long time before her remarkable action
became known. Since then she has been an object
of interest and of good offices to many benevolent
individuals. What has seemed most extraordinary
to those who have observed her proceedings has
been the natural delicacy and good breeding which
has taught her so to dispense her bounty to her helpless
charge as to take from it the appearance of an
obligation. This, no doubt, arises from the circumstance,
that she does not think of herself as conferring
one; and having the things, benevolence and
forgetfulness of self, it is but natural that she should
possess the politeness which is but their visible sign.
If she had ever read Cicero (which, as I have already
observed, I do not think probable), she might cite in
support of her philosophy the wise saying of Socrates,
which he quotes: "Whatever you would seem,
be." I will mention one instance of her delicacy in
her treatment of her guest, which will perhaps be
more highly appreciated by some of my readers than
by others. "Knowing," as she said, "that white folks
don't like to have colored folks live with them," and
having but one room for their joint accommodation,
she divided it into two parts by means of a line

<!-- v2 page 362 -->

hung with old clothes, that she might give her guest
a separate apartment in deference to her supposed
prejudices. Her conduct in every respect towards
her unfortunate friend, I am assured by those who
are well acquainted with the facts, might serve as a
model of disinterested kindness to persons of much
higher pretensions and greater advantages.</p>

<p>I was told this story during a visit which I lately
made to the beautiful town of Portsmouth, and I
conceived a strong desire to see the scene and the
heroine of it. It was the annual Thanksgiving of
New Hampshire, and I was invited, though a stranger,
to join an affectionate and accomplished family circle
on that domestic festival. The rain poured in torrents;
but we heeded it not, for "our sunshine was within."
Notwithstanding these inducements, both within
doors and without, to stay where I was, I stole away
after dinner, from the hospitable table, and proceeded
with an old college acquaintance, one of the clergymen
of the town, to the abode of Dinah Rollins. She
was not at home when we first arrived at her door,
but soon made her appearance from a neighboring
alley. And now shall I describe her? A more prudent
historian would leave his readers to imagine
how she looked; but I feel it due to them and to
Dinah to portray her appearance. She certainly was
a very different person from the heroines of the generality
of the "hot-pressed darlings," which are
annually furnished forth by "the trade" to friendship
and love, as gifts for Christmas and New Year.

<!-- v2 page 363 -->

She would find herself brought acquainted with
strange company in the "Book of Beauty" or the
"Flowers of Loveliness." Her face was of the intensest
black, and her features of the strongest
African cast; but still there was an expression of
goodness and benevolence pervading her countenance,
which, if it did not amount to positive beauty,
at least made amends for the want of it. She was
between four and five feet high, very broadly and
strongly built. She wore a man's hat upon her
head; a cloth cape, like that of a man's great-coat,
coming down to her waist, over her shoulders.</p>

<p>She received us kindly, and invited us into her
house, or rather room, which presented a different
aspect, to be sure, from the scene of elegant hospitality
I had just left. The room contained a few
rude articles of furniture and a stove. The plastering
had parted from the laths of the ceiling; so that
the sawdust of the mechanic's shop overhead would
shower down at times upon the floor. Within the
enclosure of counterpanes and old clothes we found
"the old lady," as Dinah always calls her, who has
been bedridden for a long time, being eighty-four
years old, and so deaf as to be absolutely impervious
to sound. She seemed, however, sensible of the
kindness of our intention in coming to see her. The
devotion of Dinah to her, and her absolute unconsciousness
that she was doing anything remarkable,
was perfectly beautiful. She did not seem to know
but that such a scene was acting in every house
in Portsmouth.</p>

<!-- v2 page 364 -->

<p>In a sort of shed behind her room she showed us
a hog of huge proportions, which she was raising for
winter supply, and also her harvest of Indian corn,
which she had garnered there; for, the infirmities
of her old friend requiring more time than her office
of mistress of the horse could spare, she had resigned
it, and turned her attention to other more manageable
modes of getting a subsistence, among which was
farming on a small scale. She cultivated to good
purpose, as I should judge from her crop, a small
piece of land belonging to the town; and to the honor
of the town be it told that it refuses to take any
rent of her, thus affording an exception to the general
rule that corporations have no souls. She
showed us these stores with an honest pride, and
evinced none of the shame, or indeed of the consciousness,
of poverty.</p>

<p>I do not know but some scrupulous persons may
be disposed to find fault with Dinah's <i>proteg&eacute;</i> for
being willing to be a burden upon her scanty revenue.
Possibly some admirer of the Caucasian race may
think it especially unworthy of a daughter of that
superior family to receive her support from one of
African descent. I would entreat such a one to
desist from his speculations at once, lest he should
find himself tampering with "delicate subjects," or,
peradventure, meddling with what is none of his
business. I would, however, in justice to my old
friend at Portsmouth, say that she is kept in countenance
by multitudes of reverend divines, learned

<!-- v2 page 365 -->

judges, and honorable women in the Southern States
who are provided with board and lodging, and supplied
with pocket-money, by negroes. Nay, more;
that not a few of the most eloquent advocates of the
rights of man, and the boldest opposers of monopolies,
in both branches of the national Legislature, and
some, at least, of those who from the chair of state
have uttered forth the oracles of democracy, are or
have been dependent for their daily bread and necessary
clothing upon the earnings of colored men and
women. So I conceive that Dinah's friend is borne
out by the example of these illustrious paupers, and
is not to be called in question by any one as to her
means of subsistence. Moreover, it should be remembered
that her support is given her cheerfully and
voluntarily, which, it is said, is not always the case
in the other instances I have cited; so that it appears
the difference is in her favor in the particular
in which the cases are not parallel. I did not hear,
indeed, of any attempt on her part to flog, brand, or
even sell her benefactress, upon any temptation of
pique or profit. But we must make allowances for
the disadvantages of her former condition and for
the defects of her early education.</p>

<p>What I saw and heard at this visit seemed to
imply that slaves may be able to take care of themselves,
and to dispense with the providence of a
master, without danger of starvation or beggary. I
also gathered from it that they were competent, not
only to take care of themselves, but of white people

<!-- v2 page 366 -->

too, even though they might not stand to them in
the relation of proprietor. Moreover, I perceived
that goodness of heart and refinement of feeling are
not limited by color, or conferred by education. I
discovered, too, that the truest riches may be possessed
by the poorest person, and that there are
nobler acts of munificence than those chronicled in
religious newspapers. Grateful for these lessons, I
took a kind farewell of her who had imparted them,
and heartily bade God bless her; and if ever I am
tempted to take a gloomy view of life, or to despair
of the improvement of the race, I shall refresh my
spirit by reverting to my interview with DINAH
ROLLINS.</p>
