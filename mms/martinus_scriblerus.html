<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> 

<p>TO THE</p>

<h2>READER.</h2>

</div>

<p>IN the Reign of Queen <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, 
(which notwithstanding those 
happy Times which succeeded, 
every Englishman may remember) 
thou mayst possibly, gentle 
Reader, have seen a certain Venerable 
Person who frequented 
the Outside of the Palace of St. 
James's, and who, by the Gravity 
of his Deportment and Habit, 
was generally taken for a decayed 
Gentleman of Spain. His stature 
was tall, his visage long, his 
complexion olive, his brows were

<!-- page ii -->

black and even, his eyes hollow 
yet piercing, his nose inclined to 
Aquiline, his beard neglected and 
mixed with grey: All this contributed 
to spread a solemn Melancholy 
over his countenance. 
Pythagoras was not more silent, 
Pyrrho more motionless, nor 
Zeno more austere. His Wig 
was as black and smooth as the 
plumes of a Raven, and hung 
as straight as the hair of a River God 
rising from the water. His 
Cloak so completely covered his 
whole person, that whether 
or no he had any other clothes 
(much less any linen) under it, 
I shall not say; but his sword 
appeared a full yard behind him, 
and his manner of wearing it 
was so stiff, that it seemed grown 
to his Thigh. His whole figure

<!-- page iii -->

was so utterly unlike any thing of 
this world, that it was not natural 
for any man to ask him a 
question without blessing himself 
first. Those who never saw a 
<i>Jesuit</i>, took him for one, and 
others believed him some <i>High 
Priest of the Jews</i>.</p>

<p>But under this macerated form 
was concealed a Mind replete 
with Science, burning with a 
Zeal of benefiting his fellow
creatures, and filled with an honest 
conscious Pride, mixed 
with a scorn of doing or suffering 
the least thing beneath the dignity 
of a Philosopher. Accordingly 
he had a soul that would 
not let him accept of any offers 
of Charity, at the same time 
that his body seemed but too 
much to require it. His lodging

<!-- page iv -->

was in a small chamber up four 
pair of stairs, where he regularly 
paid for what he had when he 
ate or drank, and he was often 
observed wholly to abstain from 
both. He declined speaking to 
any one, except the Queen, or her 
first Minister, to whom he 
attempted to make some applications; 
but his real business or 
intentions were utterly 
unknown to all men. Thus much is certain, 
that he was obnoxious to 
the Queen's Ministry; who either 
out of Jealousy or Envy, had 
him spirited away, and carried 
abroad as a dangerous person, 
without any regard to the known 
Laws of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>One day, as this Gentleman 
was walking about dinner-time 
alone in the Mall, it happened

<!-- page v -->

that a Manuscript dropped from 
under his cloak, which my servant 
picked up, and brought to 
me. It was written in the Latin 
tongue, and contained many 
most profound secrets, in an 
unusual turn of reasoning and 
style. The first leaf was inscribed 
with these words, <i>Codicillus, 
feu Liber Memorialis, Martini 
Scribleri</i>. The Book was of so 
wonderful a nature, that it is incredible 
what a desire I conceived 
that moment to be acquainted 
with the Author, who I clearly 
perceived was some great Philosopher 
in disguise. I several times 
endeavoured to speak to him, 
which he as often industriously 
avoided. At length I found an 
opportunity (as he stood under 
the Piazza by the Dancing-room

<!-- page vi -->

in St. James's) to acquaint him in 
the Latin tongue, that his 
Manuscript was fallen into my 
hands: and saying this, I presented 
it to him, with great Encomiums 
on the learned Author. 
Hereupon he took me aside, 
surveyed me over with a fixed 
attention, and opening the clasps 
of the Parchment cover, spoke 
(to my great surprise) in English, 
as follows.</p>

<p>"Courteous stranger, whoever 
thou art, I embrace thee 
as my best friend; for either 
the Stars and my Art are deceitful, 
or the destined time 
is come which is to manifest 
Martinus Scriblerus to the 
world, and thou the person 
chosen by fate for this task. 
What thou seest in me is a

<!-- page vii -->

body exhausted by the labours 
of the mind. I have found 
in Dame Nature not indeed an 
unkind, but a very coy Mistress: 
Watchful nights, anxious 
days, slender meals, and 
endless labours, must be the 
lot of all who pursue her, 
through her labyrinths and 
meanders. My first vital air 
I drew in this island (a soil 
fruitful of Philosophers) but 
my complexion is become 
adust, and my body arid, by 
visiting lands (as the Poet has
it) <i>alio sub sole calentes</i>. I 
have, through my whole life, 
passed under several disguises 
and unknown names, to screen 
myself from the envy and 
malice which mankind express 
against those who are

<!-- page viii -->

possessed of the <i>Arcanum 
Magnum</i>. But at present I 
am forced to take Sanctuary 
in the British Court, to avoid 
the Revenge of a cruel Spaniard,
who has pursued me almost 
through the whole terraqueous 
globe. Being about 
four years ago in the City of 
Madrid in quest of natural 
knowledge, I was informed 
of a Lady who was marked 
with a Pomegranate upon the 
inside of her right Thigh, 
which blossomed, and, as it 
were, seemed to ripen in the 
due season. Forthwith was 
I possessed with an insatiable 
curiosity to view this wonderful 
Phenomenon. I felt the 
ardour of my passion increase 
as the season advanced, till in

<!-- page ix -->

the month of July I could no 
longer contain. I bribed her 
Duenna, was admitted to the 
Bath, saw her undressed, and 
the wonder displayed. This 
was soon after discovered by 
the husband, who finding 
some letters I had writ to the 
Duenna, containing expressions 
of a doubtful meaning, 
suspected me of a crime most 
alien from the Purity of my 
Thoughts. Incontinently I 
left Madrid by the advice of 
friends, have been pursued, 
dogged, and way-laid through 
several Nations, and even now 
scarce think myself secure 
within the sacred walls of this 
Palace. It has been my good 
fortune to have seen all the 
grand Phenomena of Nature,

<!-- page x -->

excepting an Earthquake, which 
I waited for in Naples three 
years in vain; and now by 
means of some British Ship 
(whose Colours no Spaniard 
dares approach<span class="sup"><a href="#n01" id="r01">1</a></span>) I impatiently 
expect, a safe passage to Jamaica, 
for that benefit. To 
thee my Friend, whom Fate 
has marked for my Historiographer, 
I leave these my 
Commentaries, and others of 
my works, No more&mdash;be faithful 
and impartial."</p>

<p>He soon after performed his 
promise, and left me the Commentaries, 
giving me also further 
lights by many Conferences; when 
he was unfortunately snatched 
away (as I before related) by the 
jealousy of the Queen's Ministry.</p>

<!-- page xi -->

<p>Though I was thus to my eternal 
grief deprived of his conversation, 
he for some years continued his 
Correspondence, and communicated 
to me many of his Projects 
for the benefit of mankind. He 
sent me some of his Writings, and 
recommended to my care the 
recovery of others, straggling about 
the world, and assumed by 
other men. The last time I heard 
from him was on occasion 
of his Strictures on the Dunciad: since 
when, several years being elapsed, 
I have reason to believe this excellent 
person is either dead, or carried 
by his vehement thirst of 
knowledge into some remote, or 
perhaps undiscovered Region of 
the world. In either case, I think 
it a debt no longer to be delayed, 
to reveal what I know of this

<!-- page xii -->

Prodigy of Science, and to give 
the History of his life, and of his 
extensive merits to mankind; in 
which I dare promise the Reader, 
that whenever he begins to think 
any one Chapter dull, the style 
will be immediately changed in 
the next.</p>

<h3><i>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS</i>.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>BOOK I.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAP. I.</p>

<p>Of the Parentage and Family of Scriblerus, 
how he was begot, what Care was 
taken of him before he was born, and what 
Prodigies attended his Birth.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the City of Munster in Germany, 
lived a grave and learned Gentleman, 
by Profession an Antiquary; who 
among all his invaluable Curiosities, 
esteemed none more highly, than a Skin 
of the true Pergamenian Parchment, 
which hung at the upper-end of his 
hall. On this was curiously traced the 
ancient Pedigree of the <i>Scribleri</i>, with 
all their Alliances and collateral Relations

<!-- page 2 -->

(among which were reckoned Albertus 
Magnus, Paracelsus Bombastus, and the 
famous Scaligers in old time Princes 
of Verona) and deduced even from the 
Times of the Elder Pliny to Cornelius 
Scriblerus: For such was the name of 
this venerable Personage; whose glory it 
was, that by the singular Virtue of 
the Women, not one had a Head of a 
different Cast from his family.</p>

<p>His wife was a Lady of singular 
beauty, whom not for that reason only 
he espoused, but because she was undoubted 
daughter either of the great 
Scriverius, or of Gaspar Barthius. It 
happened on a time, the said Gaspar 
made a visit to Scriverius at Harlem, 
taking with him a comely Lady of his 
acquaintance, who was skilful in the 
Greek Tongue, of whom the learned 
Scriverius became so enamoured, as to 
inebriate his friend, and be familiar 
with his Mistress. I am not ignorant 
of what Columesius* affirms, that the

<!-- page 3 -->

learned Barthius was not so overtaken 
but he perceived it; and in Revenge 
suffered this unfortunate Gentlewoman 
to be drowned in the Rhine at her return. 
But Mrs. Scriblerus (the issue 
of that Amour) was a living proof of 
the falsehood of this Report. Dr. Cornelius 
was further induced to his marriage, 
from the certain information that 
the aforesaid Lady, the mother of his 
wife, was related to Cardan on the father's 
side, and to Aldrovandus on the 
mother's: Besides which, her Ancestors 
had been professors of Physic, 
Astrology, or Chemistry, in German 
Universities, from generation to generation.</p>

<p class="small">[*Columesius relates this from Isaac 
Vossius, in his Opuscul. p. 102.]</p>

<p>With this fair Gentlewoman had our 
Doctor lived in a comfortable Union 
for about ten years: But this our sober 
and orderly pair, without any natural 
infirmity, and with a constant and frequent 
compliance to the chief duty of 
conjugal life, were yet unhappy, in that 
Heaven had not blessed them with any 
issue. This was the utmost grief to 
the good man; especially considering

<!-- page 4 -->

what exact Precautions and Methods 
he had used to procure that Blessing: 
for he never had cohabitation with his 
spouse, but he pondered on the Rules of 
the Ancients, for the generation of 
Children of Wit. He ordered his diet 
according to the prescription of Galen, 
confining himself and his wife for almost 
the whole first year to Goat's 
Milk and Honey.* It unfortunately 
befel her, when she was about four 
months gone with child, to long for 
somewhat which that author inveighs 
against, as prejudicial to the understanding 
of the Infant: This her husband 
thought fit to deny her, affirming, it 
was better to be childless, than to become 
the Parent of a Fool. His Wife 
miscarried; but as the Abortion proved 
only a female Fetus, he comforted 
himself, that had it arrived to perfection, 
it would not have answered his 
account; his heart being wholly fixed 
upon the learned Sex. However he

<!-- page 5 -->

disdained not to treasure up the Embryo 
in a Vial, among the curiosities of 
his family.</p>

<p class="small">[*Galen Lib. de Cibis boni et mali succi. cap. 3.]</p>

<p>Having discovered that Galen's prescription 
could not determine the sex, 
he forthwith betook himself to Aristotle. 
Accordingly he with-held the 
nuptial embrace when the wind was 
in any point of the South; this Author* 
asserting that the grossness and 
moisture of the southerly winds occasion 
the procreation of females, and not 
of males. But he redoubled his diligence 
when the wind was at West, a 
wind on which that great Philosopher 
bestowed the Encomiums of Fattener of 
the earth, Breath of the Elysian Fields, 
and other glorious Elogies. For our 
learned man was clearly of opinion, that 
the Semina out of which Animals are 
produced, are Animalcula ready formed, 
and received in with the Air.†</p>

<p class="small">[*Arist. 14. Sect. Prob. 5.]</p>

<p class="small">[†Religion of Nature, Sect. 5. Parag. 15.]</p>

<p>Under these regulations, his wife, to 
his unexpressible joy, grew pregnant a

<!-- page 6 -->

second time; and, (what was no small 
addition to his happiness) he just then 
came to the possession of a considerable 
Estate by the death of her Uncle, a 
wealthy Jew who resided at London. 
This made it necessary for him to take 
a journey to England; nor would the 
care of his posterity let him suffer his 
Wife to remain behind him. During 
the voyage, he was perpetually taken 
up on the one hand, how to employ his 
great Riches; and on the other, how 
to educate his Child. He had already 
determined to set apart several annual 
Sums, for the recovery of <i>Manuscripts</i>, 
the effossion of <i>Coins</i>, the procuring of 
<i>Mummies;</i> and for all those curious discoveries 
by which he hoped to become 
(as himself was wont to say) a second 
<i>Peirescius</i>.<span class="sup"><a href="#n03" id="r03">3</a></span> He had already chalked 
out all possible schemes for the improvement 
of a male child, yet was so far 
prepared for the worst that could happen, 
that before the nine months were 
expired, he had composed two Treatises 
of Education; the one he called

<!-- page 7 -->

<i>A Daughter's Mirror</i>, and the other 
<i>A Son's Monitor</i>.</p>

<p>This is all we can find relating to 
Martinus, while he was in his Mother's 
womb, excepting that he was entertained 
there with a Consort of Music 
once in twenty-four hours, according to 
the Custom of the Magi: and that on a 
particular day,* he was observed to 
leap and kick exceedingly, which was 
on the first of April, the birth-day of 
the great <i>Basilius Valentinus</i>.</p>

<p class="small">[*Ramsey's Cyrus.<span class="sup"><a href="#n04" id="r04">4</a></span>]</p>

<p>The Truth of this, and every preceding 
Fact, may be depended upon, 
being taken literally from the Memoirs. 
But I must be so ingenuous as to own, 
that the Accounts are not so certain of 
the exact time and place of his birth. 
As to the first, he had the common 
frailty of old men, to conceal his age: 
as to the second, I only remember to 
have heard him say, that he first saw 
the light in St. Giles's Parish. But in 
the investigation of this point, Fortune 
hath favoured our diligence. For one

<!-- page 8 -->

day as I was passing by the <i>Seven Dials</i>, 
I overheard a dispute concerning the 
place of Nativity of a great Astrologer, 
which each man alleged to have been in 
his own street. The circumstances 
of the time, and the description of the 
person, made me imagine it might be 
that universal Genius whose life I am 
writing. I returned home, and having 
maturely considered their several arguments, 
which I found to be of equal 
weight, I quieted my curiosity with 
this natural conclusion, that he was born 
in some point common to all the seven 
streets; which must be that on which 
the Column is now erected. And it is 
with infinite pleasure that I since find 
my Conjecture confirmed, by the following 
passage in the Codicil to Mr. 
Neale's Will.</p>

<p><i>I appoint my Executors to engrave the 
following Inscription on the Column in the 
Center of the seven Streets which I erected</i>.</p> 

<p class="center">LOC. NAT. INCLUT. PHILOS. 
MAR. SCR.</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p>But Mr. Neale's Order was never performed, 
because the Executors dared not administer.</p>

<p>Nor was the Birth of this great man 
unattended with Prodigies: He himself 
has often told me, that on the night 
before he was born, Mrs. Scriblerus 
dreamed she was brought to bed of a huge 
<i>Ink-horn</i>, out of which issued 
several large streams of Ink, as it had 
been a fountain.  This dream was by 
her husband thought to signify, that the 
child should prove a very voluminous 
Writer. Likewise a <i>Crab-tree</i>* that 
had been hitherto barren, appeared on 
a sudden laden with a vast quantity of 
Crabs: This sign also the old gentleman 
imagined to be a prognostic of the 
acuteness of his Wit. A great swarm 
of <i>Wasps</i>† played round his Cradle 
without hurting him, but were very 
troublesome to all in the room besides: 
This seemed a certain presage of the effects 
of his Satire. A Dunghill was

<!-- page 10 -->

seen within the space of one night to be 
covered all over with <i>Mushroom:</i> This 
some interpreted to promise the infant great 
fertility of Fancy, but no long 
duration to his works: but the Father 
was of another opinion.</p>

<p class="small">[*Virgil's Laurel Donat.]</p>

<p class="small">[†Plato, Lucan, etc.]</p>

<p>But what was of all most wonderful, 
was a thing that seemed a monstrous 
<i>Fowl</i>, which just then dropped through 
the sky-light, near his wife's apartment. 
It had a large body, two little disproportioned 
wings, a prodigious tail, but 
no head. As its colour was white, he 
took it at first sight for a Swan, and 
was concluding his son would be a 
Poet: but on a nearer view, he perceived 
it to be speckled with black, in 
the form of letters; and that it was 
indeed a Paper kite which had broke its leash 
by the impetuosity of the wind. 
His back was armed with the Art 
Military, his belly was filled with Physic, 
his wings were the wings of Quarrels 
and Withers, the several Nodes of his 
voluminous tail were diversified with 
several branches of Science; where the 
Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of

<!-- page 11 -->

Logic, a knot of Metaphysics, a knot 
of Casuistry, a knot of Polemical Divinity, 
and a knot of Common Law, with a 
<i>Lantern</i> of <i>Jacob Behmen</i>.</p>

<p>There went a Report in the family, 
that as soon as he was born he uttered 
the voice of nine several animals: he 
cried like a Calf, bleated like a Sheep, 
chattered like a Magpie, grunted like 
a Hog, neighed like a Foal, croaked 
like a Raven, mewed like a Cat, gabbled 
like a Goose, and brayed like an 
Ass. And the next morning he was 
found playing in his bed with two 
Owls, which came down the chimney. 
His Father greatly rejoiced at all these 
signs, which betokened the variety of 
his Eloquence, and the extent of his 
Learning; but he was more particularly pleased 
with the last, as it nearly 
resembled what happened at the birth of Homer.*</p>

<p>CHAP. II.</p>

<p>The Speech of Cornelius over his Son, 
at the Hour of his Birth.</p>

</div>

<p>NO sooner was the cry of the Infant 
heard, but the old gentleman 
rushed into the room, and snatching 
it in his arms, examined every limb 
with attention. He was infinitely 
pleased to find, that the Child had the 
Wart of Cicero, the wry Neck of Alexander, 
knots upon his legs like Marius, 
and one of them shorter than the other 
like Agesilaus. The good Cornelius 
also hoped he would come to stammer 
like Demosthenes, in order to be as eloquent; 
and in time arrive at many other 
Defects of famous men. He held 
the child so long, that the Midwife 
grown out of all patience, snatched it 
from his arms, in order to swaddle it.</p>

<p>"Swaddle him?" (quoth he) "far be it 
from me to submit to such a pernicious 
Custom! Is not my son a Man?

<!-- page 13 -->

and is not Man the Lord of the Universe? 
Is it thus you use this Monarch 
at his first arrival in his dominions, 
to manacle and shackle him hand 
and foot? Is this what you call to be 
free-born? If you have no regard to 
his natural Liberty, at least have some 
to his natural Faculties. Behold 
with what agility he spreadeth his 
Toes, and moveth them with as great 
variety as his Fingers! a power, 
which in the small circle of a year
may be totally abolished, by the enormous 
confinement of shoes and 
stockings. His Ears (which other 
animals turn with great advantage towards 
the sonorous object) may, by 
the ministry of some accursed Nurse, 
for ever lie flat and immoveable. 
Not so the Ancients, they could move 
them at pleasure, and accordingly are 
often described <i>arrectis auribus</i>."</p>

<p>"What a devil," (quoth the Midwife) 
"would you have your son move his 
Ears like a Drill?"</p>

<p>"Yes fool," (said 
he) "why should he not have the perfection 
of a Drill, or of any other

<!-- page 14 -->

animal?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Scriblerus, who lay 
all this while fretting at her husband's 
discourse, at last broke out to this purpose.</p>

<p>"My dear, I have had many disputes 
with you upon this subject before 
I was a month gone: We have 
but one child, and can not afford to 
throw him away upon experiments. 
I'll have my boy bred up like other 
gentlemen, at home, and always under 
my own eye."</p>

<p>All the Gossips
with one voice, cried, "Ay, ay;" but 
Cornelius broke out in this manner.</p>

<p>"What, bred at home? Have I taken 
all this pains for a creature that is to 
lead the inglorious life of a Cabbage, 
to suck the nutritious juices from the 
spot where he was first planted? No; 
to perambulate this terraqueous Globe 
is too small a Range; were it permitted, 
he should at least make the 
Tour of the whole System of the Sun. 
Let other Mortals pore upon Maps, 
and swallow the legends of lying travellers; 
the son of Cornelius shall 
make his own Legs his Compasses; 
with those he shall measure Continents,

<!-- page 15 -->

Islands, Capes, Bays, Straits, 
and Isthmuses: He shall himself 
take the altitude of the highest mountains, 
from the peak of Derby to the 
peak of Teneriffe; when he has visited 
the top of Taurus, Imaus, Caucasus, 
and the famous Ararat where 
Noah's Ark first moored, he may take 
a slight view of the snowy Riph&aelig;ans; 
nor would I have him neglect Athos 
and Olympus, renowned for poetical 
fictions. Those that vomit fire will 
deserve a more particular attention: 
I will therefore have him observe 
with great care Vesuvius, &AElig;tna, the 
burning mountain of Java, but chiefly 
Hecla the greatest rarity in the Northern 
Regions. Then he may likewise 
contemplate the wonders of the 
Mephitic cave. When he has dived 
into the bowels of the earth, and surveyed 
the works of Nature under 
ground, and instructed himself fully 
in the nature of Volcanoes, Earthquakes, 
Thunders, Tempests and 
Hurricanes, I hope he will bless the 
world with a more exact survey of

<!-- page 16 -->

the deserts of Arabia and Tartary, 
than as yet we are able to obtain: 
Then will I have him cross the seven 
Gulfs, measure the currents in the 
fifteen famous Straits, and search 
for those fountains of fresh water, that 
are at the bottom of the Ocean."</p>

<p>At these last words Mrs. Scriblerus fell 
into a trembling: the description of 
this terrible Scene made too violent an 
impression upon a woman in her condition, 
and threw her into a strong hysteric 
Fit; which might have proved 
dangerous, if Cornelius had not been 
pushed out of the room by the united 
force of the women.</p>

<p>CHAP. III.</p>

<p>Showing what befel the Doctor's Son 
and his Shield, on the Day of the 
Christening.</p>

</div>

<p>THE day of the Christening being 
come, and the house filled 
with Gossips, the Levity of whose Conversation

<!-- page 17 -->

suited but ill with the Gravity 
of Dr. Cornelius, he cast about 
how to pass this day more agreeably 
to his Character; that is to say, not 
without some <i>Profitable Conference</i>, nor 
wholly without observance of some 
<i>Ancient Custom</i>.</p>

<p>He remembered to have read in Theocritus, 
that the Cradle of Hercules was 
a Shield; and being possessed of an antique 
<i>Buckler</i> which he held as a most 
inestimable Relic, he determined to 
have the infant laid therein, and in 
that manner brought into the Study, 
to be shown to certain learned men of 
his acquaintance.</p>

<p>The regard he had for this Shield, 
had caused him formerly to compile a 
Dissertation concerning it,<span class="sup"><a href="#n05" id="r05">5</a></span> proving 
from the several properties, and particularly 
the colour of the Rust, the exact 
chronology thereof.</p>

<p>With this Treatise, and a moderate 
supper, he proposed to entertain his 
Guests; though he had also another design, 
to have their assistance in the calculation 
of his Son's <i>Nativity</i>.</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>He therefore took the Buckler out 
of a Case (in which he always kept it 
lest it might contract any modern 
rust) and entrusted it to his House-maid, 
with orders that, when the company 
was come, she should lay the 
Child carefully in it, covered with a 
mantle of blue Satin.</p>

<p>The Guests were no sooner seated, 
but they entered into a warm Debate 
about the <i>Triclinium</i> and the manner 
of <i>Decubitus</i> of the Ancients, which 
Cornelius broke 
off in this manner.</p>

<p>"This day, my Friends, I purpose to exhibit 
my son before you; a Child not 
wholly unworthy of Inspection, as he is 
descended from a Race of Virtuosi. Let 
the Physiognomists examine his features; 
let the Chirographists behold his Palm; 
but above all, let us consult for the calculation 
of his Nativity. To this end, 
as the child is not vulgar, I will not present 
him unto you in a vulgar manner. 
He shall be cradled in my Ancient Shield, 
so famous through the Universities of 
Europe. You all know how I purchased 
that invaluable piece of Antiquity, at the

<!-- page 19 -->

great (though indeed inadequate) expense 
of all the Plate of our family, how happily 
I carried it off, and how triumphantly 
I transported it hither, to the 
inexpressible grief of all Germany. Happy 
in every circumstance, but that it broke 
the heart of the great Melchior Insipidus!"</p>

<p>Here he stopped his Speech, upon 
sight of the Maid, who entered the 
room with the Child: He took it in 
his arms, and proceeded:</p>

<p>"Behold then my Child, but first behold 
the Shield: Behold this Rust,&mdash;or rather 
let me call it this precious &AElig;rugo,&mdash;behold 
this beautiful Varnish of 
Time,&mdash;this venerable Verdure of 
so many Ages&mdash;"</p>

<p>In speaking these words, he slowly 
lifted up the Mantle, which covered it, 
inch by inch; but at every inch he uncovered, 
his cheeks grew paler, his hand 
trembled, his nerves failed, till on sight 
of the whole the Tremor became universal: 
The Shield and the Infant both 
dropped to the ground, and he had only

<!-- page 20 -->

strength enough to cry out, "O God! 
my Shield, my Shield!"</p>

<p>The Truth was, the Maid (extremely 
concerned for the reputation of her 
own cleanliness, and her young master's 
honour) had scoured it as clean as her 
Andirons.<span class="sup"><a href="#n06" id="r06">6</a></span></p>

<p>Cornelius sunk back on a chair, the 
Guests stood astonished, the infant 
squalled, the maid ran in, snatched it 
up again in her arms, flew into her mistress's 
room, and told what had happened. 
Down stairs in an instant hurried 
all the Gossips, where they found 
the Doctor in a Trance: Hungary water, 
Hartshorn, and the confused noise 
of shrill voices, at length awakened 
him: when opening his eyes, he saw 
the Shield in the hands of the House-maid.</p> 

<p>"O Woman! Woman!" he cried, 
(and snatched it violently from her) "was 
it to thy ignorance that this Relic owes 
its ruin? where, where is the beautiful 
Crust that covered thee so long? where 
those Traces of Time, and <i>Fingers</i> as it 
were of Antiquity? Where all those beautiful 
obscurities, the cause of much delightful

<!-- page 21 -->

disputation, where doubt and 
curiosity went hand in hand, and eternally 
exercised the speculations of the learned? 
All this the rude Touch of an ignorant 
woman hath done away! The <i>curious 
Prominence</i> at the belly of that 
figure, which some taking for the <i>Cuspis</i> 
of a sword, denominated a Roman 
Soldier; others accounting the <i>Insignia 
Virilia</i>, pronounced to be one of the <i>Dii 
Termini</i>; behold she hath cleaned it in 
like shameful sort, and shown to be the 
head of a Nail. O my Shield! my 
Shield! well may I say with Horace, 
<i>non bene relicta Parmula</i>."</p>

<p>The Gossips, not at all inquiring into 
the cause of his sorrow, only asked 
if the Child had no hurt? and cried, 
"Come, come, all is well; what has the 
woman done but her duty? a tight cleanly 
wench I warrant her; what a stir a 
man makes about a <i>Basin</i>, that an hour 
ago, before this labour was bestowed upon 
it, a Country Barber would not have 
hung at his shop door."</p> 

<p>"A <i>Basin!</i>" (cried 
another) "no such matter, 'tis nothing but 
a paltry old <i>Sconce</i>, with the nozzle

<!-- page 22 -->

broke off."</p> 

<p>The learned Gentlemen, 
who till now had stood speechless, hereupon 
looking narrowly on the Shield, 
declared their assent to this latter opinion; 
and desired Cornelius to be comforted, 
assuring him it was a <i>Sconce</i> and 
no other. But this, instead of comforting, 
threw the Doctor into such a 
violent Fit of Passion, that he was carried 
off groaning and speechless to bed; 
where, being quite spent, he fell into 
a kind of slumber.</p>

<p>CHAP. IV.</p>

<p>Of the Suction and Nutrition of the 
Great Scriblerus in his Infancy, and 
of the first Rudiments of his Learning.</p>

</div>

<p>AS soon as Cornelius awaked, he raised himself on 
his elbow, and casting his eye on Mrs. Scriblerus, 
spoke as follows.</p> 

<p>"Wisely was it said 
by Homer, that in the Cellar of Jupiter 
are two barrels, the one of good, the other

<!-- page 23 -->

of evil, which he never bestows on mortals 
separately, but constantly mingles them 
together. Thus at the same time hath 
Heaven blessed me with the birth of a 
Son, and afflicted me with the scouring 
of my Shield. Yet let us not repine at 
his Dispensations, who gives, and who 
takes away; but rather join in prayer, 
that the Rust of Antiquity which he hath 
been pleased to take from my Shield, may 
be added to my Son; and that so much 
of it as it is my purpose he shall contract 
in his Education, may never be destroyed 
by any modern polishing."</p>

<p>He could no longer bear the sight 
of the Shield, but ordered it should be 
removed for ever from his eyes. It 
was not long after purchased by Dr. 
Woodward, who, by the assistance of 
Mr. Kemp incrusted it with a new 
Rust, and is the same whereof a Cut 
hath been engraved, and exhibited to 
the great Contentation of the learned.</p>

<p>Cornelius now began to regulate the 
Suction of his child. Seldom did there 
pass a day without disputes between 
him and the Mother, or the Nurse,

<!-- page 24 -->

concerning the nature of Aliment. 
The poor woman never dined but he 
denied her some dish or other, which 
he judged prejudicial to her milk. One 
day she had a longing desire to a piece 
of beef, and as she stretched her hand 
towards it, the old gentleman drew it 
away, and spoke to this effect.</p>

<p>"Hadst 
thou read the Ancients, O Nurse, thou 
wouldst prefer the welfare of the Infant 
which thou nourishest, to the indulging 
of an irregular and voracious Appetite. 
Beef, it is true, may confer a Robustness 
on the limbs of my son, but will hebetate 
and clog his Intellectuals."</p>

<p>While he 
spoke this, the Nurse looked upon him 
with much anger, and now and then 
cast a wishful eye upon the beef.</p>

<p>"Passion," (continued the Doctor, still 
holding the dish) "throws the mind into too 
violent a fermentation; it is a kind of 
Fever of the soul, or, as Horace expresses 
it, a <i>Short Madness</i>. Consider Woman, 
that this day's Suction of my son may 
cause him to imbibe many ungovernable 
Passions, and in a manner spoil him for 
the temper of a Philosopher. Romulus

<!-- page 25 -->

by sucking a Wolf, became of a fierce and 
savage disposition: and were I to breed 
some Ottoman Emperor or Founder of a 
Military Commonwealth, perhaps I might 
indulge thee in this carnivorous Appetite."</p>

<p>"What," interrupted the Nurse, "Beef 
spoil the understanding? that's fine indeed&mdash;how 
then could our Parson 
preach as he does upon Beef, and Pudding 
too, if you go to that? Don't tell 
me of your Ancients, had not you almost 
killed the poor babe with a dish 
of D&aelig;monical black Broth?"</p>

<p>"Laced&aelig;monian black Broth, thou wouldst say," 
(replied Cornelius) "but I cannot allow 
the surfeit to have been occasioned by that 
diet, since it was recommended by the 
Divine Lycurgus. No, Nurse, thou 
must certainly have eaten some meats of 
ill digestion the day before, and that was 
the real cause of his disorder. Consider, 
Woman, the different Temperaments of 
different Nations: What makes the 
English Phlegmatic and melancholy but 
Beef? What renders the Welsh so hot 
and choleric, but cheese and leeks? the 
French derive their levity from their

<!-- page 26 -->

Soups, Frogs, and Mushrooms: I would 
not let my Son dine like an Italian, lest 
like an Italian he should be jealous and 
revengeful: The warm and solid diet of 
Spain may be more beneficial, as it might 
endow him with a profound Gravity, but 
at the same time he might suck in with 
their food their intolerable Vice of Pride. 
Therefore Nurse, in short, I hold it requisite 
to deny you at present, not only Beef, 
but likewise whatsoever any of those Nations 
eat."</p> 

<p>During this speech, the 
Nurse remained pouting and marking 
her plate with the knife, nor would 
she touch a bit during the whole dinner. 
This the old Gentleman observing, 
ordered that the Child, to avoid 
the risk of imbibing ill-humours, 
should be kept from her breast all that 
day, and be fed with Butter mixed 
with Honey, according to a Prescription 
he had met with somewhere in 
Eustathius upon Homer. This indeed 
gave the Child a great looseness, 
but he was not concerned at it, in the 
opinion that whatever harm it might 
do his body, would be amply recompensed

<!-- page 27 -->

by the improvements of his understanding. 
But from thenceforth 
he insisted every day upon a particular 
Diet to be observed by the Nurse; under 
which having been long uneasy, 
she at last parted from the family, on 
his ordering her for dinner the <i>Paps</i> of 
a <i>Sow</i> with Pig; taking it as the highest 
indignity, and a direct Insult upon 
her Sex and Calling.</p>

<p>Four years of young Martin's life 
passed away in squabbles of this nature. 
Mrs. Scriblerus considered it was now 
time to instruct him in the fundamentals 
of Religion, and to that end took 
no small pains in teaching him his <i>Catechism:</i> 
But Cornelius looked upon this 
as a tedious way of Instruction, and 
therefore employed his head to find out 
more pleasing methods, the better to 
induce him to be fond of learning. 
He would frequently carry him to the 
<i>Puppet-show</i> of the Creation of the 
world, where the Child with exceeding 
delight gained a notion of the History 
of the Bible. His first rudiments in 
profane history were acquired by seeing

<!-- page 28 -->

of <i>Raree-shows</i>, where he was 
brought acquainted with all the Princes 
of Europe. In short, the old Gentleman 
so contrived it, to make every 
thing contribute to the improvement 
of his knowledge, even to his very 
Dress. He invented for him a Geographical 
suit of clothes, which might 
give him some hints of that Science, and 
likewise some knowledge of the 
Commerce of different Nations. He 
had a French Hat with an African 
Feather, Holland Shirts and Flanders 
Lace, English Cloth lined with Indian 
Silk, his Gloves were Italian, and his 
Shoes were Spanish: He was made to 
observe this, and daily catechised thereupon, 
which his Father was wont to call 
<i>Travelling at home</i>. He never 
gave him a Fig or an Orange but he 
obliged him to give an account from 
what Country it came. In Natural 
history he was much assisted by his 
Curiosity in <i>Sign-Posts</i>, insomuch that 
he hath often confessed he owed to 
them the knowledge of many Creatures 
which he never found since in any Author,

<!-- page 29 -->

such as White Lions, Golden 
Dragons, etc. He once thought the 
same of Green Men, but had since 
found them mentioned by Kercherus, 
and verified in the History of William 
of Newbury.*</p>

<p class="small">[*Gul. Neubrig. Book i. Ch. 27.]</p>

<p>His disposition to the Mathematics 
was discovered very early, by his drawing 
parallel lines* on his bread and 
butter, and intersecting them at equal 
Angles, so as to form the whole Superficies 
into squares. But in the midst 
of all these Improvements, a stop was 
put to his learning the <i>Alphabet</i>, nor 
would he let him proceed to Letter D, 
till he could truly and distinctly pronounce 
C in the ancient manner, at 
which the Child unhappily boggled for 
near three months. He was also obliged 
to delay his learning to <i>write</i>, 
having turned away the Writing Master 
because he knew nothing of Fabius's 
Waxen Tables.</p>

<p class="small">[*Pascal's Life. Locke of Educ. <i>etc</i>.<span class="sup"><a href="#n07" id="r07">7</a></span>]</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>Cornelius having read, and seriously 
weighed the methods by which the famous 
Montaigne was educated,<span class="sup"><a href="#n08" id="r08">8</a></span> and resolving 
in some degree to exceed them, 
resolved he should speak and learn nothing 
but the learned Languages, and 
especially the Greek; in which he constantly 
ate and drank, according to 
Homer. But what most conduced to 
his easy attainment of this Language, 
was his love of Ginger-bread; which 
his Father observing, caused it to be 
stamped with the Letters of the Greek 
Alphabet; and the child the very first 
day ate as far as Iota. By this particular 
application to this language above 
the rest, he attained so great a proficiency 
therein, that Gronovius ingenuously 
confesses he dared not confer 
with this child in Greek at eight years 
old;<span class="sup"><a href="#n09" id="r09">9</a></span> and at fourteen he composed a 
Tragedy in the same language, as the 
younger Pliny* had done before him.</p>

<p class="small">[*Plin. Epist. Lib. 7.]</p>

<p>He learned the Oriental Languages 
of Erpenius who resided some time 

<!-- page 31 -->

with his father for that purpose. He 
had so early a relish for the Eastern 
way of writing, that even at this time 
he composed (in imitation of it) the 
<i>Thousand and One Arabian Tales</i>, and 
also the <i>Persian Tales</i>, which have been 
since translated into several languages, 
and lately into our own with particular 
elegance, by Mr. Ambrose Philips. In 
this work of his Childhood, he was 
not a little assisted by the historical 
Traditions of his 
<i>Nurse</i>.</p>

<p>CHAP. V.</p>

<p>A Dissertation upon Play-things.</p>

</div>

<p>HERE follow the Instructions 
of Cornelius Scriblerus concerning 
the Plays and Play-things to be 
used by his son Martin.</p>

<p>"<i>Play</i> was invented by the <i>Lydians</i> 
as a remedy against <i>Hunger</i>. Sophocles 
says of Palamedes, that he 
invented <i>Dice</i> to serve sometimes instead 
of a dinner. It is therefore

<!-- page 32 -->

wisely contrived by Nature, that 
Children, as they have the keenest 
<i>Appetites</i>, are most addicted to <i>Plays</i>. 
From the same cause, and from the 
unprejudiced and incorrupt simplicity 
of their minds it proceeds, that 
the Plays of the Ancient Children are 
preserved more entire than any other 
of their Customs.<span class="sup"><a href="#n10" id="r10">10</a></span> In this matter I 
would recommend to all who have 
any concern in my Son's Education, 
that they deviate not in the least from 
the primitive and simple Antiquity.</p>

<p>"To speak first of the <i>Whistle</i>, as it 
is the first of all Play-things. I will 
have it exactly to correspond with the 
ancient <i>Fistula</i>, and accordingly to 
be composed, <i>septem paribus disjuncta 
cicutis</i>.</p>

<p>"I heartily wish a diligent search 
may be made after the true <i>Crepitaculum</i> 
or <i>Rattle</i> of the Ancients, for 
that (as <i>Archytas Tarentinus</i> was of 
opinion) kept the children from breaking 
Earthen Ware. The <i>China</i> Cups 
in these days are not at all the safer 
for the modern <i>Rattles;</i> which is an

<!-- page 33 -->

evident proof how far their <i>Crepitacula</i> 
exceeded ours.</p>

<p>"I would not have Martin as yet to 
scourge a <i>Top</i>, till I am better informed 
whether the <i>Trochus</i>, which 
was recommended by <i>Cato</i>, be really 
our present <i>Top</i>, or rather the <i>Hoop</i> 
which the boys drive with a stick. 
Neither <i>Cross</i> and <i>Pile</i>, nor <i>Ducks</i> 
and <i>Drakes</i> are quite so ancient as 
<i>Handy-dandy</i>, though Marcobius and St. 
Augustine take notice of the first, and 
Minucius Felix describes the latter; 
but <i>Handy-dandy</i> is mentioned by 
Aristotle, Plato, and Aristophanes.</p>

<p>"The Play which the Italians call 
<i>Cinque</i>, and the French <i>Mourre</i>, is 
extremely ancient; it was played at by 
<i>Hymen</i> and <i>Cupid</i> at the Marriage of 
<i>Psyche</i>, and termed by the Latins, 
<i>digitis micare</i>.</p>

<p>"Julius Pollux describes the <i>Omilla</i> 
or <i>Chuck farthing:</i> though some will 
have our modern <i>Chuck-farthing</i> to 
be nearer the <i>Aphetinda</i> of the Ancients. 
He also mentions the <i>Basilinda</i>,

<!-- page 34 -->

or <i>King I am</i>; and <i>Myinda</i>, or 
<i>Hoopers-Hide</i>.</p>

<p>"But the <i>Chytindra</i> described by the 
same Author is certainly not our 
<i>Hot-cockle;</i> for that was by pinching 
and not by striking; though there are 
good authors who affirm the <i>Rathapygismus</i> 
to be yet nearer the modern 
<i>Hot-cockle</i>. My son Martin may 
use either of them indifferently, they 
being equally antique.</p>

<p>"<i>Building of Houses</i>, and <i>Riding upon 
Sticks</i>, have been used by children 
in all ages, <i>&AElig;dificare casas, equitare in 
arundine longa</i>. Yet I must doubt 
whether the Riding upon Sticks did 
not come into use after the age of 
the <i>Centaurs</i>.</p>

<p>"There is one Play which shows the 
gravity of ancient Education, called 
the <i>Acinetinda</i>, in which children 
contended who could longest <i>stand 
still</i>. This we have suffered to perish 
entirely; and, if I might be allowed 
to guess, it was certainly first 
lost among the <i>French</i>.</p>

<!-- page 35 -->

<p>"I will permit my Son to play at 
<i>Apodidiascinda</i>, which can be no other 
than our <i>Puss in a Corner</i>.</p>

<p>"Julius Pollux in his ninth book 
speaks of the <i>Melolonthe</i> or the <i>Kite;</i> 
but I question whether the Kite of 
Antiquity was the same with ours: 
And though the <i>'Ορτυγοκοπία</i> or <i>Quail-fighting</i> 
is what is most taken notice 
of, they had doubtless <i>Cock-matches</i> 
also, as is evident from certain ancient 
Gems and Relievos.</p>

<p>"In a word, let my son Martin disport 
himself at any Game truly Antique, 
except one, which was invented 
by a people among the Thracians, 
who hung up one of their Companions 
in a Rope, and gave him a Knife 
to cut himself down; which if he 
failed in, he was suffered to hang till 
he was dead; and this was only 
reckoned a sort of joke. I am utterly 
against this, as barbarous and 
cruel.</p>

<p>"I cannot conclude, without taking 
notice of the beauty of the <i>Greek</i> 
names, whose etymologies acquaint

<!-- page 36 -->

us with the nature of the sports; and 
how infinitely, both in sense and 
sound, they excel our barbarous names 
of Plays."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing Injunctions 
of Dr. Cornelius, he yet condescended 
to allow the Child the use of 
some few modern Play-things; such 
as might prove of any benefit to his 
mind, by instilling an early notion of 
the sciences. For example, he found 
that <i>Marbles</i> taught him <i>Percussion</i> and 
the <i>Laws of Motion;</i> <i>Nut-crackers</i> the 
use of the <i>Lever;</i> <i>Swinging</i> on the 
ends of a board, the <i>Balance;</i> <i>Bottle-screws</i>, 
the <i>Vice;</i> <i>Whirligigs</i> the <i>Axis</i> 
and <i>Peritrochia;</i> <i>Bird-cages</i>, the <i>Pulley;</i> 
and <i>Tops</i> the <i>Centrifugal</i> motion.</p>

<p>Others of his sports were farther 
carried to improve his tender soul even 
in Virtue and Morality. We shall only 
instance one of the most useful and 
instructive, <i>Bob-cherry</i>, which teaches 
at once two noble Virtues, Patience 
and Constancy; the first in adhering 
to the pursuit of one end, the latter in 
bearing a disappointment.</p>

<!-- page 37 -->

<p>Besides all these, he taught him as 
a diversion, an odd and secret manner of 
<i>Stealing</i>, according to the Custom 
of the Laced&aelig;monians; wherein he 
succeeded so well, that he practised it 
to the day of his death.</p>

<p>CHAP. VI.</p>

<p>Of the Gymnastics, in what Exercises 
Martinus was educated; something 
concerning Music, and what sort of 
a Man his Uncle was.</p>

</div>

<p>NOR was Cornelius less careful in 
adhering to the rules of the purest 
Antiquity, in relation to the <i>Exercises</i> 
of his Son. He was stripped, powdered, 
and anointed, but not constantly 
bathed, which occasioned many heavy 
complaints of the Laundress about dirtying 
his linen. When he played at 
Quoits, he was allowed his Breeches 
and Stockings; because the <i>Discoboli</i> 
(as Cornelius well knew) were naked 
to the middle only. The Mother often

<!-- page 38 -->

contended for modern Sports and common 
Customs, but this was his constant 
reply, "Let a Daughter be the care of her 
Mother, but the Education of a Son 
should be the Delight of his Father."</p>

<p>It was about this time, he heard to 
his exceeding content, that the <i>Harpastus</i> 
of the Ancients was yet in use 
in <i>Cornwall</i>, and known there by 
the name of <i>Hurling</i>. He was sensible 
the common <i>Foot-ball</i> was a very imperfect 
imitation of that exercise; and 
thought it necessary to send Martin into 
the West, to be initiated in that truly ancient 
and manly part of the <i>Gymnastics</i>. 
The poor boy was so unfortunate 
as to return with a broken leg. 
This Cornelius looked upon but as a 
slight ailment, and promised his Mother 
he would instantly cure it: He slit a 
green Reed, and cast the knife upward, 
then tying the two parts of the Reed 
to the disjointed place, pronounced 
these words,* <i>Daries, daries, astataries,

<!-- page 39 -->

dissunapiter; huat, hanat, huat, ista, 
pista fista, domi abo, damnaustra</i>. But 
finding to his no small astonishment, 
that this had no effect, in five days he 
condescended to have it set by a modern 
Surgeon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scriblerus, to prevent him from 
exposing her son to the like dangerous 
Exercises for the future, proposed to 
send for a Dancing-Master, and to have 
him taught the Minuet and Rigadoon.</p>

<p>"Dancing," (quoth Cornelius) "I much approve,

were the best Warriors; but not those 
species of Dancing which you mention: 
They are certainly Corruptions of the 
Comic and Satyric Dance, which were 
utterly disliked by the sounder Ancients.

only, and I will send all over <i>Europe</i> till

boasts to have performed this warlike 
Dance in the Presence of the Emperor, 
to the great admiration of all Germany.

and see one of his posterity so ignorant, 
as not to know the least step of that noble 
kind of <i>Saltation?</i>"</p>

<p>The poor Lady was at last inured to 
bear all these things with a laudable 
patience, till one day her husband was 
seized with a new thought. He had 
met with a saying, that "<i>Spleen</i>, <i>Garter</i>, 
and <i>Girdle</i> are the three impediments 
to the <i>Cursus</i>." Therefore 
Pliny (lib. xi. cap. 37.) says, that such 
as excel in that exercise have their 
<i>Spleen</i> cauterized.</p>

<p>"My son," (quoth Cornelius) 
"runs but heavily; therefore I 
will have this operation performed upon 
him immediately. Moreover it will cure 
that immoderate Laughter to which I 
perceive he is addicted: For laughter 
(as the same author hath it, ibid.) is 
caused by the bigness of the Spleen."</p> 

<p>This 
design was no sooner hinted to Mrs.  
Scriblerus, but she burst into tears,

<!-- page 41 -->

wrung her hands, and instantly sent to 
his Brother Albertus, begging him for 
the love of God to make haste to her 
husband.</p>

<p>Albertus was a discreet man, sober 
in his opinions, clear of Pedantry, and 
knowing enough both in books and in 
the world, to preserve a due regard for 
whatever was useful or excellent, whether 
ancient or modern: If he had not 
always the authority, he had at least 
the art, to divert Cornelius from many 
extravagancies. It was well he came 
speedily, or Martin could not have 
boasted the entire Quota of his Viscera.</p> 

<p>"What does it signify," (quoth Albertus) 
"whether my Nephew excels in the <i>Cursus</i> 
or not? Speed is often a symptom of Cowardice, 
witness Hares and Deer."</p>

<p>"Do 
not forget Achilles:" (quoth Cornelius) 
"I know that Running has been condemned 
by the proud Spartans, as useless in war; 
and yet Demosthenes could say <i>'Ανήρ ὁ φεύγων 
κὶ πάλιν μαχήσθαι</i>, a thought which the 
English Hudibras has well rendered,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza"><i>For he that runs may fight again,

</div>

<p>"That's true," (quoth Albertus) "but pray 
consider on the other side that Animals 
spleened* grow extremely salacious, an 
experiment well known in dogs."</p> 

<p class="small">[*Blackmore's Essay on Spleen.]</p>

<p>Cornelius 
was struck with this, and replied 
gravely; "If it be so, I will defer the 
Operation, for I will not increase the 
powers of my son's body at the expense of 
those of his mind. I am indeed disappointed 
in most of my projects, and fear 
I must sit down at last contented with 
such methods of Education as modern barbarity 
affords. Happy had it been for 
us all, had we lived in the age of Augustus! 
Then my son might have heard 
the Philosophers dispute in the Porticos of 
the Pal&aelig;stra, and at the same time formed 
his Body and his Understanding."</p>

<p>"It is 
true," (replied Albertus) "we have no <i>Exedra</i> 
for the Philosophers, adjoining to 
our Tennis-Courts; but there are Ale-Houses, 
where he will hear very notable

argumentations: Though we come not up to 
the Ancients in the <i>Tragic-dance</i>, we excel 
them in the <i>κυβισική</i>, or the art of 
<i>Tumbling</i>. The Ancients would have 
beat us at <i>Quoits</i>, but not so much at the 
<i>Jaculum</i> or <i>pitching the Bar</i>. The 
<i>Pugilatus</i>* is in as great perfection in 
England as in old Rome, and the Cornish-Hug 
in the <i>Luctus</i>† is equal to 
the <i>volutatoria</i> of the Ancients."</p>

<p class="small">[*Fisticuffs.]</p>

<p class="small">[†Wrestling.]</p>

<p>"You 
could not," (answered Cornelius) "have produced 
a more unlucky instance of modern 
folly and barbarity, than what you say 
of the <i>Jaculum</i>. The Cretans* wisely 
forbid their servants Gymnastics, as well 
as Arms; and yet your modern Footmen 
exercise themselves daily in the <i>Jaculum</i> 
at the corner of <i>Hyde Park</i>, whilst their 
enervated Lords are lolling in their chariots 
(a species of Vectitation seldom used 
amongst the Ancients, except by old Men.)"</p>

<p class="small">[*Arist. politic. lib. ii, cap. 3.]</p>

<p>"You say well," (quoth Albertus) "and we 
have several other kinds of Vectitation 
unknown to the Ancients, particularly 
flying Chariots, where the people may

<!-- page 44 -->

have the benefit of this exercise at the 
small expense of a farthing. But suppose 
(which I readily grant) that the Ancients 
excelled us almost in every thing, yet 
why this singularity? your son must take 
up with such masters as the present age 
affords; we have Dancing-masters, Writing-masters, 
and Music-masters."</p>

<p>The bare mention of <i>Music</i> 
threw Cornelius into a passion. "How can 
you dignify," (quoth he) "this modern fiddling 
with the name of Music? Will any of 
your best Hautboys encounter a Wolf nowadays 
with no other arms but their instruments, 
as did that ancient piper Pythocaris? 
Have ever wild Boars, Elephants, 
Deer, Dolphins, Whales or Turbots, 
showed the least emotion at the most 
elaborate strains of your modern Scrapers, 
all which have been, as it were, tamed and 
humanized by ancient Musicians? Does 
not &AElig;lian* tell us how the Lybian 
Mares were excited to horsing by Music? 
(which ought in truth to be a caution to 
modest Women against frequenting Operas;

<!-- page 45 -->

and consider, brother, you are brought to 
this dilemma, either to give up the virtue 
of the Ladies, or the power of your 
Music) Whence proceeds the degeneracy 
of our Morals? Is it not from the loss 
of ancient Music, by which (says Aristotle) 
they taught all the Virtues? Else 
might we turn Newgate into a College of 
Dorian Musicians, who should teach moral 
Virtues to those people. Whence 
comes it that our present diseases are so 
stubborn? whence is it that I daily deplore 
my Sciatical pains? Alas! because 
we have lost their true cure, by the melody 
of the Pipe. All this was well
known to the Ancients, as Theophrastus† 
assures us, (whence C&aelig;lius‡ calls it 
<i>loca dolentia decantare</i>) only indeed some 
small remains of this skill is preserved in 
the cure of the Tarantula. Did not 
Pythagoras§ stop a company of drunken 
Bullies from storming a civil house, by 
changing the strain of the Pipe to the sober 
Spond&aelig;us? and yet your modern Musicians 
want art to defend their windows

from common <i>Nickers</i>. It is well known 
that when the Laced&aelig;monian Mob were 
up, they commonly‖ sent for a Lesbian 
Musician to appease them, and they immediately 
grew calm as soon as they heard 
Terpander sing: Yet I don't believe that 
the Pope's whole band of Music, though 
the best of this age, could keep his Holiness's 
Image from being burnt on a fifth 
of November."</p>

<p>"Nor would Terpander 
himself," (replied Albertus) "at Billingsgate, 
nor Timotheus at Hockley in the 
Hole have any manner of effect, nor both 
of 'em together bring Horneck* to common 
civility."</p>

<p class="small">[*Horneck, a scurrilous Scribler who wrote a weekly 
paper, called <i>the High German Doctor</i>.]</p>

<p>"That's a gross mistake," 
(said Cornelius very warmly) and to prove 
it so, I have here a small Lyra of my 
own, framed, strung, and tuned after 
the ancient manner. I can play some 
fragments of Lesbian tunes, and I wish 
I were to try them upon the most passionate 
creatures alive."</p>

<p>"You never had a better 
opportunity," (says Albertus) "for yonder 
are two apple-women scolding, and just

<!-- page 47 -->

ready to uncoif one another."</p>

<p>With that 
Cornelius, undressed as he was, jumps 
out into his Balcony, his Lyra in hand, 
in his slippers, with his breeches hanging 
down to his ankles, a stocking upon 
his head, and a waistcoat of murrey-coloured 
satin upon his body: He 
touched his Lyra with a very unusual 
sort of an Harpegiatura, nor were his 
hopes frustrated. The odd Equipage, 
the uncouth Instrument, the strangeness 
of the Man and of the Music, 
drew the ears and eyes of the whole 
Mob that were got about the two female 
Champions, and at last of the 
Combatants themselves. They approached 
the Balcony, in as close attention 
as Orpheus's first Audience of Cattle, 
or that of an Italian Opera when 
some favourite Air is just awakened. 
This sudden effect of his Music encouraged 
him mightily, and it was observed 
he never touched his Lyre in such 
a truly chromatic and enharmonic 
manner as upon that occasion. The 
mob laughed, sung, jumped, danced, and 
used many odd gestures, all which he

<!-- page 48 -->

judged to be caused by his various strains 
and modulations.</p>

<p>"Mark," (quoth he) "in 
this, the power of the <i>Ionian</i>, in that, 
you see the effect of the <i>&AElig;olian</i>."</p> 

<p>But in 
a little time they began to grow riotous, 
and threw stones: Cornelius then 
withdrew, but with the greatest air of 
Triumph in the world.</p>

<p>"Brother," (said 
he) "do you observe I have mixed unawares 
too much of the <i>Phrygian;</i> I might 
change it to the <i>Lydian</i>, and soften their 
riotous tempers: But it is enough: learn 
from this Sample to speak with veneration 
of ancient Music. If this Lyre in 
my unskilful hands can perform such wonders, 
what must it not have done in those 
of a Timotheus or a Terpander?"</p> 

<p>Having 
said this, he retired with the utmost 
Exultation in himself, and Contempt 
of his Brother; and, it is said, behaved 
that night with such unusual 
haughtiness to his family, that they 
all had reason to wish for some ancient 
Tibicen to calm his Temper.</p>

<p>CHAP. VII.</p>

<p>Rhetoric, Logic, and Metaphysics.</p>

</div>

<p>CORNELIUS having (as hath been 
said) many ways been disappointed 
in his attempts of improving the 
bodily Forces of his son, thought it now 
high time to apply to the Culture of 
his Internal faculties. He judged it 
proper in the first place to instruct him 
in <i>Rhetoric</i>. But herein we shall not 
need to give the Reader any account of his 
wonderful progress, since it is already 
known to the learned world by his 
Treatise on this subject: I mean the 
admirable Discourse <i>Περι Βαθους</i>, which he 
wrote at this time, but concealed from 
his Father, knowing his extreme partiality 
for the Ancients. It lay by him 
concealed, and perhaps forgot among 
the great multiplicity of other Writings, 
till about the year 1727, he sent it us 
to be printed, with many additional examples 
drawn from the excellent live

<!-- page 50 -->

Poets of this present age. We proceed 
therefore to <i>Logic</i> and <i>Metaphysics</i>.</p>

<p>The wise Cornelius was convinced, 
that these being <i>Polemical</i> Arts, could 
no more be learned alone, than Fencing 
or Cudgel-playing. He thought it 
therefore necessary to look out for some 
Youth of pregnant parts, to be a sort of 
humble Companion to his son in those 
studies. His good fortune directed him 
to one of most singular endowments, 
whose name was Conradus Crambe, 
who by the father's side was related to 
the <i>Crouches</i> of Cambridge, and his mother 
was Cousin to Mr. <i>Swan</i>, Gamester 
and Punster of the City of London. 
So that from both parents he drew a 
natural disposition to sport himself with 
<i>Words</i>, which as they are said to be 
the counters of wise Men, and ready-money 
of Fools, Crambe had great 
store of cash of the latter sort. Happy 
Martin in such a Parent, and such a 
Companion! What might not he achieve 
in Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>Here I must premise a general observation 
of great benefit to mankind.

<!-- page 51 -->

That there are many people who have 
the use only of one Operation of the 
Intellect, though like short-sighted men 
they can hardly discover it themselves: 
they can form <i>single apprehensions</i>,<span class="sup"><a href="#n11" id="r11">11</a></span> but 
have neither of the other two faculties, 
the <i>judicium</i> or <i>discursus</i>. Now as it 
is wisely ordered, that people deprived 
of one sense have the others in more 
perfection, such people will form single 
Ideas with a great deal of vivacity; and 
happy were it indeed if they would 
confine themselves to such, without 
forming <i>judicia</i>, much less <i>argumentations</i>.</p>

<p>Cornelius quickly discovered, that 
these two last operations of the intellect 
were very weak in Martin, and almost 
totally extinguished in Crambe; 
however he used to say that Rules of 
Logic are Spectacles to a purblind understanding, 
and therefore he resolved 
to proceed with his two Pupils.</p>

<p>Martin's understanding was so totally 
immersed in <i>sensible objects</i>, that he 
demanded examples from Material 
things of the abstracted Ideas of Logic:

<!-- page 52 -->

as for Crambe, he contented 
himself with the Words, and when he 
could but form some conceit upon 
them, was fully satisfied. Thus Crambe 
would tell his Instructor, that All 
men were not <i>singular;</i> that Individuality 
could hardly be predicated of 
any man, for it was commonly said that 
a man <i>is</i> not the same he <i>was</i>; that 
madmen are <i>beside themselves</i>, and drunken 
men <i>come to themselves;</i> which 
shows, that few men have that most 
valuable logical endowment, Individuality.<span class="sup"><a href="#n12" id="r12">12</a></span> 
Cornelius told Martin that a 
shoulder of mutton was an individual, 
which Crambe denied, for he had seen 
it cut into commons:</p> 

<p>"That's true,"
(quoth the Tutor) "but you never saw 
it cut into shoulders of mutton."</p>

<p>"If it 
could," (quoth Crambe) "it would be the 
most lovely individual of the University."</p> 

<p>When he was told, a <i>substance</i> 
was that which was <i>subject to accidents;</i> 
"then Soldiers," (quoth Crambe) "are the 
most substantial people in the World."</p>

<p>Neither would he allow it to be a good 
definition of <i>accident</i>, that it could be

<!-- page 53 -->

<i>present or absent without the destruction 
of the subject;</i> since there are a great 
many accidents that destroy the subject, 
as burning does a house, and death 
a man. But as to that, Cornelius informed 
him, that there was a <i>natural 
death</i>, and a <i>logical death;</i> that though 
a man after his natural death was not 
capable of the least parish-office, yet 
he might still keep his Stall amongst 
the logical predicaments.</p>

<p>Cornelius was forced to give Martin 
sensible images; thus calling up the 
Coachman he asked him what he had 
seen in the Bear-garden? the man answered 
he saw two men fight a prize; 
one was a fair man, a Sergeant in the 
Guards, the other black, a Butcher; 
the Sergeant had red breeches, the 
Butcher blue; they fought upon a Stage 
about four o'clock, and the Sergeant 
wounded the Butcher in the leg.</p>

<p>"Mark," 
(quoth Cornelius) "how the fellow runs 
through the predicaments. Men, <i>Substantia;</i> 
two, <i>quantitas;</i> fair and black, 
<i>qualitas;</i> Sergeant and Butcher, <i>relatio;</i> 
wounded the other, <i>actio et passio;</i> fighting,

<!-- page 54 -->

<i>situs;</i> stage, <i>ubi;</i> four o'clock, 
<i>quando;</i> blue and red Breeches, <i>habitus</i>."</p>

<p>At the same time he warned Martin, 
that what he now <i>learned</i> as a Logician, 
he must <i>forget</i> as a natural Philosopher; 
that though he now taught them that accidents 
inhered in the subject, they 
would find in time there was no such 
thing; and that colour, taste, smell, 
heat, and cold, were not in the things 
but only phantasms of our brains. He 
was forced to let them into this secret, 
for Martin could not conceive how a 
habit of dancing inhered in a dancing-master, 
when he did not dance; nay, 
he would demand the Characteristics 
of Relations. Crambe used to help him 
out by telling him, a Cuckold, a losing 
gamester, a man that had not dined, a 
young heir that was kept short by his 
father, might be all known by their 
countenance; that, in this last case, 
the Paternity and Filiation leave very 
sensible impressions in the <i>relatum</i> and 
<i>correlatum</i>. The greatest difficulty was, 
when they came to the Tenth Predicament: 
Crambe affirmed, that his

<!-- page 55 -->

<i>Habitus</i> was more a substance than he 
was; for his clothes could better subsist 
without him, than he without his 
clothes.</p>

<p>Martin supposed an <i>Universal Man</i> 
to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Burgess 
of a Corporation, that represented 
a great many Individuals. His Father 
asked him, if he could not frame the 
Idea of an Universal Lord Mayor? 
Martin told him, that never having seen 
but one Lord Mayor, the Idea of that 
Lord Mayor always returned to his 
mind; that he had great difficulty to 
abstract a Lord Mayor from his Fur 
Gown, and Gold Chain; nay, that the 
horse he saw the Lord Mayor ride 
upon not a little disturbed his imagination. 
On the other hand Crambe, to show 
himself of a more penetrating genius, 
swore that he could frame a conception 
of a Lord Mayor not only without his 
Horse, Gown, and Gold Chain, but 
even without Stature, Feature, Colour, 
Hands, Head, Feet, or any Body; 
which he supposed was the abstract of 
a Lord Mayor.<span class="sup"><a href="#n13" id="r13">13</a></span> Cornelius told him

<!-- page 56 -->

that he was a lying Rascal; that an 
<i>Universale</i> was not the object of imagination, 
and that there was no such 
thing in reality, or a <i>parte Rei</i>.</p>

<p>"But I 
can prove," (quoth Crambe) "that there 
are <i>Clysters a parte Rei</i>, but <i>clysters</i> are 
<i>universales; ergo</i>. Thus I prove my 
Minor. <i>Quod aptum est inesse multis</i>, 
is an <i>universale</i> by definition: but every 
clyster before it is administered has that 
quality; therefore every clyster is an 
<i>universale</i>."</p>

<p>He also found fault with the Advertisements, 
that they were not strict 
logical <i>definitions:</i> In an advertisement 
of a Dog stolen or strayed, he said 
it ought to begin thus, <i>An irrational animal</i> 
of the <i>Genus Caninum</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Cornelius 
told them, that though those advertisements 
were not framed according 
to the exact rules of logical definitions, 
being only <i>descriptions</i> of things <i>numero 
differentibus</i>, yet they contained a faint 
image of the <i>pr&aelig;dicabilia</i>, 
and were highly subservient to the common purposes 
of life; often discovering things that were lost, 
both animate and inanimate.

<!-- page 57 -->

"An Italian Grey-hound, of a 
mouse-colour, a white speck in the neck, 
lame of one leg, belongs to such a Lady. 
Grey-hound, <i>genus;</i> mouse-coloured, 
etc. <i>differentia;</i> lame of one leg, <i>accidens;</i> 
belongs to such a Lady, <i>proprium</i>."</p>

<p>Though I'm afraid I have transgressed 
upon my Reader's patience already, I 
cannot help taking notice of one thing 
more extraordinary than any yet mentioned; 
which was Crambe's <i>Treatise 
of Syllogisms</i>. He supposed that a Philosopher's 
brain was like a great Forest, 
where Ideas ranged like animals of several 
kinds; that those Ideas copulated, 
and engendered Conclusions; that 
when those of different Species copulate, 
they bring forth monsters or absurdities; 
that the <i>Major</i> is the male, the 
<i>Minor</i> the female, which copulate 
by the Middle Term, and engender the 
Conclusion. Hence they are called the 
<i>pr&aelig;missa</i>, or Predecessors of the Conclusion; 
and it is properly said by Logicians 
<i>quod pariant scientiam, opinionem,</i> 
they <i>beget</i> science, opinion, etc. Universal

<!-- page 58 -->

Propositions are Persons of quality; 
and therefore in Logic they are 
said to be of the first <i>Figure</i>. Singular 
Propositions are private persons, and 
therefore placed in the third or last 
figure, or rank. From those principles 
all the rules of Syllogisms naturally 
follow.</p>

<ol type="I">

<li>That there are only three Terms, 
neither more nor less; for to a child 
there can be only one father and one 
mother.</li>

<li>From universal premises there follows 
an universal conclusion, as if 
one should say that persons of quality 
always beget persons of quality.</li>

<li>From singular premises follows 
only a singular conclusion, that is, if 
the parents be only private people, 
the issue must be so likewise.</li>

<li>From particular propositions nothing 
can be concluded, because the 
<i>Individua vaga</i> are (like whore-masters 
and common strumpets) 
barren.</li>

<!-- page 59 -->

<li>There cannot be more in the conclusion 
than was in the premises, 
that is, children can only inherit 
from their parents.</li>

<li>The conclusion follows the weaker 
part, that is, children inherit the 
diseases of their parents.</li>

<li>From two negatives nothing can 
be concluded, for from divorce or 
separation there can come no issue.</li>

<li>The medium cannot enter the 
conclusion, that being logical incest.</li>

<li>An hypothetical proposition is only 
a contract, or a promise of marriage; 
from such therefore there can spring 
no real issue.</li>

<li>When the premises or parents 
are necessarily joined (or in lawful 
wedlock) they beget lawful issue; 
but contingently joined, they beget 
bastards.</li>

</ol>

<p>So much for the Affirmative propositions; 
the Negative must be deferred 
to another occasion.</p>

<p>Crambe used to value himself upon 
this System, from whence he said one

<!-- page 60 -->

might see the propriety of the expression, 
<i>such a one has a barren imagination;</i> 
and how common is it for such 
people to <i>adopt</i> conclusions that are not 
the issue of their premises? therefore 
as an Absurdity is a <i>Monster</i>, a Falsity 
is a <i>Bastard;</i> and a true conclusion that 
followeth not from the premises, may 
properly be said to be <i>adopted</i>.</p>

<p>"But 
then what is an Enthymeme," (quoth 
Cornelius)?"</p>

<p>"Why, an Enthymeme," (replied 
Crambe) "is when the Major is 
indeed married to the Minor, but the 
Marriage <i>kept secret</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Metaphysics</span> were a large field 
in which to exercise the Weapons <i>Logic</i> 
had put into their hands. Here 
Martin and Crambe used to engage like 
any prize fighters, before their Father, 
and his other Learned companions 
of the Symposiacs. And as Prize fighters 
will agree to lay aside a buckler or 
some such defensive weapon, so would 
Crambe promise not to use <i>simpliciter 
et secundum quid</i>, provided Martin 
would part with <i>materialiter et formaliter:</i> 
But it was found, that, without

<!-- page 61 -->

the help of the defensive armour of 
those Distinctions, the arguments cut 
so deep, that they fetched blood at every 
stroke. Their <i>Theses</i> was picked 
out of Suarez, Thomas Aquinas, and 
other learned writers on those subjects. 
I shall give the Reader a taste of some 
of them.</p>

<ol type="I">

<li>If the Innate Desire of the knowledge 
of Metaphysics was the cause 
of the Fall of Adam; and the <i>Arbor 
Porphyriana</i>, the Tree of Knowledge of 
good and evil? <i>affirmed</i>.</li>

<li>If transcendental goodness could be 
truly predicated of the Devil? <i>affirmed</i>.</li>

<li>Whether one, or many be first? 
or if one doth not suppose the notion 
of many? <i>Suarez</i>.</li>

<li>If the desire of news in mankind

Whether besides the real being of

</ol>

<p>This brings into my mind a Project 
to banish Metaphysics out of Spain, 
which was supposed might be effectuated 
by this method: That nobody 
should use any Compound or Decompound 
of the Substantial Verbs but as 
they are read in the common conjugations: 
for every body will allow, that 
if you debar a Metaphysician from <i>ens, 
essentia, entitas, subsistentia,</i> etc. there 
is an end of him.</p>

<p>Crambe regretted extremely, that 
<i>Substantial Forms</i>, a race of harmless 
beings which had lasted for many years, 
and afforded a comfortable subsistence 
to many poor Philosophers, should be 
now hunted down like so many Wolves, 
without the possibility of a retreat. 
He considered that it had gone much 
harder with them than with <i>Essences</i>,

<!-- page 64 -->

which had retired from the <i>Schools</i> into 
the <i>Apothecaries Shops</i>, where some of 
them had been advanced to the degree 
of <i>Quintessences</i>. He thought there 
should be a retreat for poor <i>substantial 
Forms</i>, amongst the Gentleman-ushers at 
court; and that there were indeed <i>substantial 
forms</i>, such as <i>forms of Prayer</i>, 
and <i>forms of Government</i>, without which, 
the things themselves could never long 
subsist. He also used to wonder that 
there was not a reward for such as could 
find out a <i>fourth figure</i> in <i>Logic</i>, as 
well as for those who should discover 
the <i>Longitude</i>.</p>

<p>CHAP. VIII.</p>

<p>ANATOMY.</p>

</div>

<p>CORNELIUS, it is certain, had a most 
superstitious veneration for the 
Ancients; and if they contradicted each 
other, his Reason was so pliant and 
ductile, that he was always of the 
opinion of the last he read. But 
he reckoned it a point of honour never 
to be vanquished in a dispute; from

<!-- page 65 -->

which quality he acquired the title of 
the <i>Invincible Doctor</i>. While the Professor 
of Anatomy was demonstrating 
to his son the several kinds of <i>Intestines</i>, 
Cornelius affirmed that there were only 
two, the <i>Colon</i> and the <i>Aichos</i>, according 
to Hippocrates, who it was impossible 
could ever be mistaken. It was 
in vain to assure him this error proceeded 
from want of accuracy in dividing 
the whole Canal of the Guts: "Say 
what you please," (he replied) "this is 
both mine and Hippocrates's opinion."</p>

<p>"You may with equal reason," (answered 
the Professor) "affirm that a man's Liver 
hath five Lobes, and deny the Circulation 
of the blood."</p> 

<p>"Ocular demonstration," 
(said Cornelius) "seems to be on 
your side, yet I shall not give it up: 
Show me any viscus of a human body, 
and I will bring you a Monster that 
differs from the common rule in the 
structure of it. If Nature shows such 
variety in the same age, why may she 
not have extended it further in several 
ages? Produce me a man now of the 
age of an Antediluvian: of the strength

<!-- page 66 -->

of Sampson, or the size of the Giants. 
If in the whole, why not in parts of 
the body, may it not be possible the 
present generation of men may 
differ from the Ancients? The Moderns 
have perhaps lengthened the channel 
of the guts by Gluttony, and diminished 
the liver by hard drinking. Though 
it shall be demonstrated that modern 
blood circulates, yet I will still believe 
with Hippocrates, that the blood of 
the Ancients had a flux and reflux from 
the heart, like a Tide. Consider how 
Luxury hath introduced new diseases, 
and with them not improbably, altered 
the whole Course of the Fluids. Consider 
how the current of mighty Rivers, 
nay the very channels of the Ocean, are 
changed from what they were in ancient 
days; and can we be so vain to 
imagine, that the Microcosm of the 
human body alone is exempted from 
the fate of all things? I question not 
but plausible Conjectures may be made 
even as to the Time when the blood 
first began to circulate."</p>

<p>Such disputes as these frequently perplexed the

<!-- page 67 -->

Professor to that degree, that he would 
now and then in a passion leave him 
in the middle of a Lecture, as he did at 
this time.</p>

<p>There unfortunately happened soon 
after, an unusual accident, which retarded 
the prosecution of the studies of 
Martin. Having purchased the body 
of a Malefactor, he hired a Room for 
its dissection near the Pest-fields in St. 
Giles's, at a little distance from Tyburn 
Road. Crambe (to whose care this body 
was committed) carried it thither 
about twelve o'clock at night in a Hackney-coach, 
few House-keepers being 
very willing to let their lodgings to such 
kind of Operators. As he was softly 
stalking up stairs in the dark, with the 
dead man in his arms, his burthen had 
like to have slipped from him, which 
he (to save from falling) grasped so hard 
about the belly that it forced the wind 
through the <i>Anus</i>, with a noise exactly 
like the <i>Crepitus</i> of a living man. 
Crambe (who did not comprehend how 
this part of the Animal Economy could 
remain in a dead man) was so terrified,

<!-- page 68 -->

that he threw down the body, ran up 
to his master, and had scarce breath to 
tell him what had happened. Martin 
with all his philosophy could not prevail 
upon him to return to his post.</p>

<p>"You may say what you please," (quoth 
Crambe) "no man alive ever broke wind 
more naturally; nay, he seemed to be 
mightily relieved by it."</p>

<p>The rolling 
of the corpse down stairs made such a 
noise that it awaked the whole house. 
The maid shrieked, the landlady cried 
out "Thieves;" but the Landlord, in his 
shirt as he was, taking a candle in one 
hand and a drawn sword in the other, 
ventured out of the Room. The maid 
with only a single petticoat ran up stairs, 
but spurning at the dead body, fell upon 
it in a swoon. Now the Landlord 
stood still and listened, then he looked 
behind him, and ventured down in this 
manner one stair after another, till he 
came where lay his maid, as dead, upon 
another corpse unknown. The wife 
ran into the street and cried out "Murder!" 
the Watch ran in, while Martin 
and Crambe, hearing all this uproar,

<!-- page 69 -->

were coming down stairs. The Watch 
imagined they were making their escape, 
seized them immediately, and carried 
them to a neighbouring Justice; where, 
upon searching them, several kind of 
knives and dreadful weapons were found 
upon them. The Justice first examined 
Crambe.</p>

<p>"What is your Name?" says 
the Justice.</p>

<p>"I have acquired," (quoth 
Crambe) "no great Name as yet; they 
call me Crambe or Crambo, no matter 
which, as to myself; though it may be 
some dispute to posterity."</p>

<p>"What 
is yours and your Master's profession?"</p>

<p>"It is our business 
to imbrue our hands in blood; we cut off the 
heads, and pull out the hearts of those that never injured 
us; we rip up big-bellied women, and tear children 
limb from limb."</p> 

<p>Martin endeavoured to interrupt 
him; but the Justice, being strangely astonished 
with the frankness of Crambe's Confession, ordered him 
to proceed; upon which he made the following Speech.</p>

<p>"May it please your Worship, as touching 
the body of this man, I can answer 
each head that my accusers allege against

<!-- page 70 -->

me, to a hair. They have hitherto talked 
like numbskulls without brains; but if 
your Worship will not only give ear, but 
regard me with a favourable eye, I will 
not be brow-beaten by the supercilious 
looks of my adversaries, who now stand 
cheek by jowl by your Worship. I will 
prove to their faces, that their foul mouths 
have not opened their lips without a falsity; 
though they have showed their teeth 
as if they would bite off my nose. Now, 
Sir, that I may fairly slip my Neck out 
of the collar, I beg this matter may not 
be slightly skinned over. Though I have no 
man here to back me, I will unbosom 
myself, since Truth is on my side, and 
shall give them their bellies' full, though 
they think they have me upon the hip. 
Whereas they say I came into their lodgings, 
with arms, and murdered this man 
without their Privity, I declare I had 
not the least finger in it; and since 
I am to stand upon my own legs, nothing 
of this matter shall be left till I set it 
upon a right foot. In the vein I am in, 
I cannot for my heart's blood and guts 
bear this usage: I shall not spare my

<!-- page 71 -->

lungs to defend my good name: I was 
ever reckoned a good liver; and I think 
I have the bowels of compassion. I ask 
but justice, and from the crown of my 
head to the sole of my foot I shall ever 
acknowledge myself your Worship's humble 
Servant."</p>

<p>The Justice stared, the Landlord and 
Landlady lifted up their eyes, and Martin 
fretted, while Crambe talked in this 
rambling incoherent manner; till at 
length Martin begged to be heard. It 
was with great difficulty that the Justice 
was convinced, till they sent for 
the Finisher of human laws, of whom 
the Corpse had been purchased; who 
looking near the left ear, knew his own 
work, and gave Oath accordingly.</p>

<p>No sooner was Martin got home, 
but he fell into a passion at Crambe. 
"What Daemon," he cried, "hath possessed thee 
that thou will never forsake that impertinent 
custom of punning? Neither my 
council nor my example have thus misled 
thee; thou governest thyself by most erroneous 
Maxims."</p> 

<p>"Far from it," (answers 
Crambe) "my life is as orderly as my

<!-- page 72 -->

Dictionary, for by my Dictionary I order 
my life. I have made a Calendar 
of radical words for all the seasons, 
months, and days of the year: Every 
day I am under the dominion of a certain 
Word: but this day in particular 
I cannot be misled, for I am governed 
by one that rules all sexes, ages, conditions, 
nay all animals rational and irrational. 
Who is not governed by the word 
<i>Led?</i> Our Noblemen and Drunkards 
are pimp-led, Physicians and Pulses 
fee-led, their Patients and Oranges 
pil-led, a New-married Man and an 
Ass are bride-led, an Old-married Man 
and a Pack-horse sad-led; Cats and 
Dice are rat-led, Swine and Nobility are 
sty-led, a Coquette and a Tinder-box are 
spark-led, a Lover and a Blunderer are 
grove-led. And that I may not be tedious&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which thou art," (replied Martin, 
stamping with his foot) "which thou 
art, I say, beyond all human toleration. 
Such an unnatural, unaccountable, 
uncoherent, unintelligible, unprofitable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There it is now!" (interrupted 
Crambe) "this is your Day for <i>Uns</i>."</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p>Martin could bear no longer&mdash;however 
composing his Countenance, "Come hither," 
(he cried) "there are five pounds, 
seventeen shillings and nine pence: thou 
hast been with me eight months, three 
weeks, two days, and four hours."</p> 

<p>Poor Crambe upon the receipt of his Salary, 
fell into tears, flung the money upon 
the ground, and burst forth in these 
words:</p>

<p>"O Cicero, Cicero! if to pun be 
a crime, 'tis a crime I have learned from 
thee: O Bias, Bias! if to pun be a 
crime, by thy example was I biased."</p>

<p>Whereupon Martin (considering that 
one of the greatest of Orators, and even 
a Sage of Greece had punned), hesitated, 
relented, and reinstated Crambe in his Service.</p>

<p>CHAP. IX.</p>

<p>How Martin became a great Critic.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a most peculiar Talent in 
Martinus, to convert every Trifle 
into a serious thing, either in the way

<!-- page 74 -->

of Life, or in Learning. This can no 
way be better exemplified, than in the 
effect which the Puns of Crambe had 
on the Mind and Studies of Martinus. 
He conceived, that somewhat of a like 
Talent to this of Crambe, of <i>assembling 
parallel sounds</i>, either <i>syllables</i>, or <i>words</i>, 
might conduce to the Emendation and 
Correction of <i>Ancient Authors</i>, if applied 
to their Works, with the same 
<i>diligence</i>, and the same <i>liberty</i>. He resolved 
to try first upon Virgil, Horace, 
and Terence; concluding, that if the 
<i>most correct</i> Authors could be so served 
with any reputation to the Critic, the 
amendment and alteration of <i>all the 
rest</i> would easily follow; whereby a 
new, a vast, nay boundless Field of 
Glory would be opened to the true and 
<i>absolute Critic</i>.</p>

<p>This Specimen on Virgil he has given 
us, in the Addenda to his Notes on the 
Dunciad. His Terence and Horace 
are in every body's hands, under the 
names of Richard B&mdash;ley, and Francis 
H&mdash;re. And we have convincing 
proofs that the late Edition of Milton

<!-- page 75 -->

published in the name of the former of 
these, was in truth the Work of no other 
than our Scriblerus.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch10">

<p>CHAP. X.</p>

<p>Of Martinus's uncommon Practice of 
Physic, and how he applied himself 
to the Diseases of the Mind.</p>

</div>

<p>BUT it is high time to return to the 
History of the Progress of Martinus 
in the Studies of Physic, and to 
enumerate some at least of the many 
Discoveries and Experiments he made 
therein.</p>

<p>One of the first was his Method of 
investigating latent Distempers, by the 
sagacious Quality of <i>Setting-Dogs</i> and 
<i>Pointers</i>. The Success, and the Adventures 
that befel him, when he walked 
with these animals, to smell them out 
in the Parks and public places about 
London, are what we would willingly 
relate; but that his own Account, together 
with a <i>List of those Gentlemen

<!-- page 76 -->

and Ladies</i> at whom they made a <i>Full
Set</i>, will be published in time convenient. 
There will also be added the Representation, 
which, on occasion of one 
distemper which was become almost epidemical, 
he thought himself obliged 
to lay before both Houses of Parliament, 
entitled, <i>A Proposal for a General Flux</i>, 
to exterminate at one blow the P&mdash;x 
out of this kingdom.</p>

<p>He next proceeded to an Enquiry 
into the <i>Nature</i> and <i>Tokens</i> of <i>Virginity</i>, 
according to the Jewish Doctrines, 
which occasioned that most curious 
Treatise of the <i>Purification of Queen 
Esther</i>,* with a <i>Display</i> of her <i>Case</i> at 
large; speedily also to be published.</p>

<p class="small">[*Vid. Esther, chap. 2. vers. 12.]</p>

<p>But being weary of all practice on 
<i>f&oelig;tid Bodies</i>, from a certain niceness of 
Constitution, (especially when he attended 
Dr. Woodward through a Twelvemonth's 
course of Vomition) he determined 
to leave it off entirely, and to apply 
himself only to diseases of the <i>Mind</i>. 
He attempted to find out Specifics for

<!-- page 77 -->

all the <i>Passions;</i> and as other Physicians 
throw their Patients into sweats, 
vomits, purgations, etc. he cast them 
into Love, hatred, hope, fear, joy, grief, 
etc. And indeed the great Irregularity 
of the Passions in the English 
Nation, was the chief motive that induced 
him to apply his whole studies, 
while he continued among us, to the 
Diseases of the Mind.</p>

<p>To this purpose he directed, in the 
first place, his late acquired skill in <i>Anatomy</i>. 
He considered <i>Virtues</i> and <i>Vices</i> 
as certain Habits which proceed from 
the natural Formation and Structure of 
particular parts of the body. A Bird 
flies because it has Wings, a Duck 
swims because it is web-footed: and 
there can be no question but the Aduncity 
of the pounces, and beaks of the 
Hawks, as well as the length of the 
fangs, the sharpness of the teeth, and 
the strength of the crural and Masseter-muscles<span class="sup"><a href="#n14" id="r14">14</a></span> 
in Lions and Tigers, are the 
cause of the great and habitual Immorality 
of those Animals.</p>

<!-- page 78 -->

<p>1<i>st</i>, He observed that the Soul and 
Body mutually operate upon each other, 
and therefore if you deprive the 
Mind of the outward Instruments 
whereby she usually expresseth that 
Passion, you will in time abate the 
Passion itself, in like manner as Castration 
abates Lust.</p>

<p>2<i>dly</i>, That the Soul in mankind expresseth 
every Passion by the Motion of 
some particular <i>Muscles</i>.</p>

<p>3<i>dly</i>, That all Muscles grow stronger 
and thicker by being <i>much used;</i> therefore 
the habitual Passions may be discerned 
in particular persons by the 
<i>strength</i> and <i>bigness</i> of the Muscles used 
in the expression of that Passion.</p>

<p>4<i>thly</i>, That a Muscle may be 
strengthened or weakened by weakening 
or strengthening the force of its Antagonist. 
These things premised, he took notice,</p>

<p>That <i>Complaisance, humility, assent, 
approbation</i>, and <i>civility</i>, were expressed 
by nodding the head and bowing the 
body forward: on the contrary, <i>dissent, 
dislike, refusal, pride</i>, and <i>arrogance</i>,

<!-- page 79 -->

were marked by tossing the head, and 
bending the body backwards: which 
two Passions of <i>assent</i> and <i>dissent</i> the 
Latins rightly expressed by the words 
<i>adnuere</i> and <i>abnuere</i>. Now he observed 
that complaisant and civil people had 
the Flexors of the head very strong; 
but in the proud and insolent there was 
a great over-balance of strength in the 
Extensors of the Neck and the Muscles 
of the Back, from whence they perform 
with great facility the motion of 
<i>tossing</i>, but with great difficulty that of 
<i>bowing</i>, and therefore have justly acquired 
the Title of <i>stiff-necked</i> In order 
to reduce such persons to a just 
balance, he judged that the pair of 
Muscles called <i>Recti interni</i>, the Mastoidal, 
with other flexors of the head, 
neck, and body must be strengthened; 
their Antagonists, the <i>Splenii Complexi</i>, 
and the Extensors of the Spine, weakened; 
For which purpose Nature herself 
seems to have directed mankind to 
correct this Muscular Immorality by 
tying such fellows <i>Neck-and-heels</i>.</p>

<!-- page 80 -->

<p>Contrary to this, is the pernicious 
Custom of Mothers, who abolish the 
natural Signature of Modesty in their 
Daughters by teaching them <i>tossing</i> and 
<i>bridling</i>, rather than the bashful posture 
of <i>stooping</i>, and <i>hanging down the 
head</i>. Martinus charged all husbands 
to take notice of the <i>Posture of the 
Head</i> of such as they courted to Matrimony, 
as that upon which their future 
happiness did much depend.</p>

<p><i>Flatterers</i>, who have the flexor Muscles 
so strong that they are always bowing 
and cringing, he supposed might in 
some measure be corrected by being 
tied down upon a Tree by the back, 
like the children of the Indians; which 
doctrine was strongly confirmed by his 
observing the strength of the <i>levatores 
Scapul&aelig;:</i> This Muscle is called 
the Muscle of <i>patience</i>, because in that affection 
of Mind, people shrug and raise 
up the shoulder to the tip of the ear. 
This Muscle also he observed to be exceedingly 
strong and large in <i>Henpecked 
Husbands</i>, in <i>Italians</i>, and in <i>English 
Ministers</i>.</p>

<!-- page 81 -->

<p>In pursuance of his Theory, he supposed 
the <i>constrictors</i> of the <i>Eye-lids,</i> 
must be strengthened in the supercilious, 
the <i>abductors</i> in drunkards and contemplative 
men, who have the same steady and grave motion of the eye. 
That the <i>buccinators</i> or blowers up of 
the <i>cheeks</i>, and the <i>dilators</i> of the <i>Nose</i>, 
were too strong in Choleric people; 
and therefore Nature here again directed 
us to a remedy, which was to correct 
such extraordinary dilatation by 
<i>pulling by the Nose</i>.</p>

<p>The rolling amorous Eye, in the 
Passion of Love, might be corrected by 
frequently looking through glasses. Impertinent 
fellows that jump upon Tables, 
and cut capers, might be cured by relaxing 
medicines applied to the <i>Calves</i> of 
their <i>legs</i>, which in such people are too 
strong.</p>

<p>But there were two Cases which he 
reckoned extremely difficult. First, 
<i>Affectation</i>, in which there were so 
many Muscles of the bum, thighs, belly, 
neck, back, and the whole body, all

<!-- page 82 -->

in a false tone, that it required an impracticable 
multiplicity of applications.</p>

<p>The second case was immoderate 
<i>Laughter:</i> When any of that risible 
species were brought to the Doctor, and 
when he considered what an infinity of 
Muscles these laughing Rascals threw 
into a convulsive motion at the same 
time; whether we regard the spasms 
of the Diaphragm and all the muscles 
of respiration, the horrible <i>rictus</i> of the 
mouth, the distortion of the lower jaw, 
the crisping of the nose, twinkling of 
the eyes, or spherical convexity of the 
cheeks, with the tremulous succussion 
of the whole human body: when he 
considered, I say, all this, he used to cry 
out <i>Casus plane deplorabilis!</i> and give 
such Patients over.</p>

<p>CHAP. XI.</p>

<p>The Case of a young Nobleman at Court, 
with the Doctor's Prescription for 
the same.</p>

</div>

<p>AN eminent Instance of Martinus's 
Sagacity in discovering the Distempers 
of the Mind, appeared in the 
case of a young Nobleman at Court, 
who was observed to grow extremely 
affected in his speech, and whimsical in 
all his behaviour. He began to ask 
odd questions, talk in verse to himself, 
shut himself up from his friends, and be 
accessible to none, but Flatterers, Poets, and 
Pickpockets; till his Relations 
and old Acquaintance judged him to be so 
far gone, as to be a fit Patient for the 
Doctor.</p>

<p>As soon as he had heard and examined 
all the symptoms, he pronounced 
his distemper to be <i>Love</i>.</p>

<p>His friends assured him that they had 
with great care observed all his motions,

<!-- page 84 -->

and were perfectly satisfied there was 
no Woman in the case. Scriblerus 
was as positive that he was desperately 
in love with some person or other.</p>

<p>"How can that be?" (said his Aunt, who 
came to ask the advice) "when he converses 
almost with none but himself?"</p>

<p>"Say you 
so?" he replied, "why then he is in love 
with Himself, one of the most common 
cases in the world. I am astonished, 
people do not enough attend this 
Disease, which has the same causes and 
symptoms, and admits of the same cure, 
with the other: especially since here 
the case of the Patient is the more helpless 
and deplorable of the two, as this 
unfortunate passion is more blind than 
the other. There are people who discover 
from their very youth a most amorous 
inclination to themselves; 
which is unhappily nursed by such 
Mothers, as with their good will, would 
never suffer their children  to be <i>crossed 
in love</i>. Ease, luxury, and idleness, 
blow up this flame as well as the other: 
Constant opportunities of conversation 
with the person beloved, (the greatest

<!-- page 85 -->

of incentives) are here impossible to be 
prevented. Bawds and pimps, in the 
other love, will be perpetually doing 
kind offices, speaking a good word for 
the party, and carry about Billet-doux. 
Therefore I ask you, Madam, if this 
Gentleman has not been much frequented 
by Flatterers, and a sort of people 
who bring him dedications and verses?"</p>

<p>"O Lord! Sir," (quoth the Aunt) "the 
house is haunted with them."</p>

<p>"There it 
is," (replied Scriblerus) "those are the 
bawds and pimps that go between a 
man and himself. Are there no civil 
Ladies, that tell him he dresses well, 
has a gentlemanly air, and the like?"</p>

<p>"Why truly Sir, my Nephew is not awkward."</p>

<p>"Look you Madam, this is 
a misfortune to him: In former days 
these sort of lovers were happy in one 
respect, that they never had any Rivals, 
but of late they have all the Ladies so&mdash;&mdash;Be 
pleased to answer a few questions 
more. Whom does he generally 
talk of?"</p>

<p>"Himself," quoth the Aunt.</p> 

<p>"Whose wit and breeding does he most 
commend?"</p> 

<p>"His own," quoth the Aunt.</p>

<!-- page 86 -->

<p>"Whom does he write letters to?"</p> 

<p>"Himself."</p> 

<p>"Whom does he dream of?"</p> 

<p>"All 
the dreams I ever heard were of himself.</p>

<p>"Whom is he ogling yonder?"</p> 

<p>"Himself in his looking-glass."</p> 

<p>"Why 
does he throw back his head in that 
languishing posture?"</p> 

<p>"Only to be blessed 
with a smile of himself as he passes by."</p> 

<p>"Does he ever steal a kiss from himself, 
by biting his lips?"</p> 

<p>"Oh continually, till 
they are perfect vermilion."</p> 

<p>"Have you 
observed him to use Familiarities with 
any body?"</p> 

<p>"With none but himself: he 
often embraces himself with folded arms, 
he claps his hand often upon his hip, nay 
sometimes thrusts it into&mdash;his breast."</p>

<p>"Madam," said the Doctor, "all these 
are strong symptoms, but there remain 
a few more. Has this amorous gentleman 
presented himself with any Love-toys; 
such as gold Snuff-boxes, repeating 
Watches, or Tweezer-cases? those 
are things that in time will soften the 
most obdurate heart."</p> 

<p>"Not only so," (said 
the Aunt) "but he bought the other day a 
very fine brilliant diamond Ring for his 
own wearing."</p>

<p>"Nay, if he has accepted

<!-- page 87 -->

of this Ring, the intrigue is very 
forward indeed, and it is high time for 
friends to interpose. Pray Madam, a 
word or two more&mdash;Is he jealous that 
his acquaintance do not behave themselves 
with respect enough? will he 
bear jokes and innocent freedoms?"</p> 

<p>"By no means; a familiar appellation 
makes him angry; if you shake him a 
little roughly by the hand, he is in a rage; 
but if you chuck him under the chin he 
will return you a box on the ear."</p>

<p>"Then the case is plain: he has the true 
Pathognomic sign of Love, <i>Jealously;</i> 
for nobody will suffer his mistress to 
be treated at that rate. Madam, upon 
the whole this case is extremely dangerous. 
There are some people who are 
far gone in this passion of self-love, but 
then they keep a <i>very secret Intrigue</i> 
with themselves, and hide it from all 
the world besides. But this Patient 
has not the least care of the Reputation 
of his Beloved, he is downright scandalous 
in his behaviour with himself; 
he is enchanted, bewitched, and almost

<!-- page 88 -->

past cure. However, let the following 
methods be tried upon him.</p>

<p>"First, let him *** <i>Hiatus</i>. *** 
Secondly, let him wear a Bob-wig. 
Thirdly, shun the Company of flatterers, 
nay of ceremonious people, and of 
all Frenchmen in general. It would 
not be amiss if he traveled over England 
in a Stage-coach, and made the 
Tour of Holland in a Trackscout. 
Let him return the Snuff-boxes, Tweezer-cases 
(and particularly the Diamond 
Ring), which he has received 
from himself. Let some knowing 
friend represent to him the many vile 
Qualities of this Mistress of his: let 
him be shown that her Extravagance, 
Pride, and Prodigality, will infallibly 
bring him to a morsel of bread: Let it 
be proved, that he has been False to 
himself, and if Treachery is not a sufficient 
cause to discard a Mistress, what 
is? In short, let him be made to see 
that no mortal besides himself either 
loves or can suffer this Creature. Let 
all Looking-glasses, polished Toys, and 
even clean Plates be removed from him,

<!-- page 89 -->

for fear of bringing back the admired 
object. Let him be taught to put off 
all those tender airs, affected smiles, 
languishing looks, wanton tosses of the 
head, coy motions of the body, that 
mincing gait, soft tone of voice, and all 
that enchanting woman-like behaviour, 
that has made him the charm of his 
own eyes, and the object of his own adoration. 
Let him surprise the Beauty 
he adores at a disadvantage, survey himself 
naked, divested of artificial charms, 
and he will find himself a forked straddling 
Animal, with bandy legs, a short 
neck, a dun hide, and a pot-belly. It 
would be yet better if he took a strong 
purge once a week, in order to contemplate 
himself in that condition: at 
which time it will be convenient to 
make use of the Letters, Dedications, 
etc. abovesaid. Something like this 
has been observed by Lucretius and others 
to be a powerful remedy in the 
case of Women. If all this will not 
do, I must even leave the poor man to 
his destiny. Let him <i>marry himself</i>, 
and when he is condemned eternally to

<!-- page 90 -->

himself, perhaps he may run to the 
next pond to get rid of himself, the 
Fate of most violent Self-lovers."</p>

<p>CHAP. XII.</p>

<p>How Martinus endeavoured to find out 
the Seat of the Soul, and of his Correspondence 
with the Free-Thinkers.</p>

</div>

<p>IN this Design of Martin to investigate 
the Diseases of the Mind, he 
thought nothing so necessary as an Enquiry 
after the <i>Seat</i> of the <i>Soul;</i> in 
which at first he laboured under great 
uncertainties. Sometimes he was of 
opinion that it lodged in the Brain, 
sometimes in the Stomach, and sometimes 
in the Heart. Afterwards he 
thought it absurd to confine that sovereign 
Lady to one apartment, which 
made him infer that she shifted it according 
to the several functions of life: 
The Brain was her Study, the Heart 
her State-room, and the Stomach her 
Kitchen. But as he saw several Offices

<!-- page 91 -->

of life went on at the same time, he 
was forced to give up this Hypothesis 
also. He now conjectured it was more 
for the dignity of the Soul to perform 
several Operations by her little Ministers, 
the <i>Animal Spirits</i>, from whence it was 
natural to conclude, that she resides in 
different parts according to different Inclinations, 
Sexes, Ages, and Professions. 
Thus in Epicures he seated her in the 
mouth of the Stomach, Philosophers 
have her in the Brain, Soldiers in their 
Heart, Women in their Tongues, Fiddlers 
in their Fingers, and Rope-dancers 
in their Toes. At length he grew fond 
of the <i>Glandula Pinealis</i>, dissecting 
many Subjects to find out the different 
Figure of this Gland, from whence he 
might discover the cause of the different 
Tempers in mankind. He supposed 
that in factious and restless-spirited 
people he should find it sharp and 
pointed, allowing no room for the Soul 
to repose herself; that in quiet Tempers 
it was flat, smooth, and soft, affording 
to the Soul as it were an easy 
cushion. He was confirmed in this by

<!-- page 92 -->

observing, that Calves and Philosophers, 
Tigers and Statesmen, Foxes and Sharpers, 
Peacocks and Fops, Cock-Sparrows 
and Coquettes, Monkeys and Players, 
Courtiers and Spaniels, Moles and 
Misers, exactly resemble one another 
in the conformation of the <i>Pineal 
Gland</i>. He did not doubt likewise to 
find the same resemblance in Highwaymen 
and Conquerors: In order to satisfy 
himself in which, it was, that 
he purchased the body of one of the 
first Species (as hath been before related) 
at Tyburn, hoping in time to have 
the happiness of one of the latter too, 
under his Anatomical knife.</p>

<p>We must not omit taking notice here 
that these Inquiries into the <i>Seat</i> 
of the <i>Soul</i> gave occasion to his first 
correspondence with the society of <i>Free 
Thinkers</i>, who were then in their infancy 
in England, and so much taken with 
the promising endowments of Martin, 
that they ordered their Secretary to 
write him the following Letter.</p>

<br/>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p class="center"><i>To the learned Inquisitor into Nature</i>, 
<span class="smcap">Martinus Scriblerus</span>: <i>The 
Society of</i> Free-Thinkers <i>greeting</i>.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Grecian</i> Coffee-House, May 7.</p>

<p>IT is with unspeakable joy we have 
heard of your Inquisitive Genius, 
and we think it great pity that it 
should not be better employed, than in 
looking after that Theological Non-entity 
commonly called the <i>Soul:</i> Since 
after all your enquiries, it will appear 
you have lost your labour in seeking 
the Residence of such a Chimera, that 
never had being but in the brains of 
some dreaming Philosophers. Is it not 
<i>Demonstration</i> to a person of your Sense, 
that since <i>you cannot find it</i>, there is <i>no 
such thing?</i> In order to set so hopeful 
a Genius right in this matter, we have 
sent you an answer to the ill-grounded 
Sophisms of those crack-brained fellows, 
and likewise an easy <i>mechanical Explanation</i> 
of <i>Perception</i> or <i>Thinking</i>.</p>

<p>One<span class="sup"><a href="#n15" id="r15">15</a></span> of their chief Arguments is,

<!-- page 94 -->

that <i>Self-consciousness</i> cannot inhere in 
any system of <i>Matter</i>, because all matter 
is made up of several distinct beings, 
which never can make up one individual 
thinking being.</p>

<p>This is easily answered by a familiar 
instance. In every <i>Jack</i> there is a <i>meat-roasting</i> 
Quality, which neither resides 
in the Fly, nor in the Weight, nor in 
any particular wheel of the Jack, but 
is the result of the whole composition: 
So in an Animal, the Self-consciousness 
is not a real Quality inherent in one Being 
(any more than meat-roasting in 
a Jack) but the result of several Modes 
or Qualities in the same subject. As 
the fly, the wheels, the chain, the 
weight, the cords, etc. make one Jack, 
so the several parts of the body make 
one Animal. As perception or consciousness 
is said to be inherent in this Animal, 
so is meat-roasting said to be inherent 
in the Jack. As sensation, reasoning, 
volition, memory, etc. are the 
several Modes of thinking; so roasting 
of beef, roasting of mutton, roasting 
of pullets, geese, turkeys, etc. are the

<!-- page 95 -->

several modes of meat-roasting. And 
as the general Quality of meat-roasting, 
with its several modifications as to beef, 
mutton, pullets, etc. does not inhere 
in any one part of the Jack; so neither 
does consciousness, with its several 
modes of sensation, intellection, 
volition, etc. inhere in any one, but is 
the result from the mechanical composition 
of the whole Animal.</p>

<p>Just so, the Quality or disposition in 
a Fiddle to play tunes, with the several 
modifications of this <i>tune playing</i> 
quality in playing of Preludes, Sarabands, 
Jigs, and Gavottes, are as much 
real qualities in the Instrument, as the 
thought or the imagination is in the 
mind of the Person that composes them.</p>

<p>The Parts (say they) of an animal 
body are perpetually changed, and the 
fluids which seem to be subject of consciousness, 
are in a perpetual circulation; 
so that the same individual particles 
do not remain in the Brain; from 
whence it will follow, that the idea of 
Individual Consciousness must be constantly 
translated from one particle of

<!-- page 96 -->

matter to another, whereby the particle 
A, for example, must not only be 
conscious, but conscious that it is the 
same being with the particle B that went 
before.</p>

<p>We answer, this is only a fallacy of 
the imagination, and is to be understood 
in no other sense than that maxim of 
the English Law, that the <i>King never 
dies</i>. This power of thinking, self-moving, 
and governing the whole Machine, 
is communicated from every 
Particle to its immediate Successor; 
who, as soon as he is gone, immediately 
takes upon him the Government, 
which still preserves the Unity of the 
whole System.</p>

<p>They make a great noise about this 
Individuality: how a man is conscious 
to himself that he is the same Individual 
he was twenty years ago; notwithstanding 
the flux state of the Particles 
of matter that compose his body. We 
think this is capable of a very plain answer, 
and may be easily illustrated by a 
familiar example.</p>

<p>Sir John Cutler had a pair of black

<!-- page 97 -->

worsted stockings, which his maid darned 
so often with silk, that they became 
at last a pair of silk stockings. Now 
supposing those stockings of Sir John's 
endued with some degree of Consciousness 
at every particular darning, they 
would have been sensible, that they 
were the same individual pair of stockings 
both before and after the darning; 
and this sensation would have continued 
in them through all the succession of 
darnings; and yet after the last of all, 
there was not perhaps one thread left 
of the first pair of stockings, but they 
were grown to be silk stockings, as was 
said before.</p>

<p>And whereas it is affirmed, that every 
animal is conscious of some individual 
self-moving, self-determining principle; 
it is answered, that, as in a House 
of Commons all things are determined 
by a <i>Majority</i>, so it is in every Animal 
system. As that which determines the 
House is said to be the reason of the 
whole assembly; it is no otherwise with 
thinking Beings, who are determined 
by the greater force of several particles;

<!-- page 98 -->

which, like so many unthinking Members, 
compose one thinking System.</p>

<p>And whereas it is likewise objected, 
that Punishments cannot be just that 
are not inflicted upon the same individual, 
which cannot subsist without the 
notion of a spiritual substance. We 
reply, that this is no greater difficulty 
to conceive, than that a Corporation, 
which is likewise a flux body, may be 
punished for the faults, and liable to 
the debts, of their Predecessors.</p>

<p>We proceed now to explain, by the 
structure of the Brain, the several 
Modes of thinking. It is well known 
to Anatomists that the Brain is a <i>Congeries</i> 
of Glands, that separate the finer 
parts of the blood, called Animal 
Spirits; that a Gland is nothing but a 
canal of a great length, variously intorted 
and wound up together. From 
the Arietation and Motion of the Spirits 
in those Canals, proceed all the 
different sorts of Thoughts: Simple Ideas 
are produced by the motion of the 
Spirits in one simple Canal: when two 
of these Canals disembogue themselves

<!-- page 99 -->

into one, they make what we call a 
Proposition; and when two of these 
propositional Channels empty themselves 
into a third, they form a Syllogism, or 
a Ratiocination. Memory is performed 
in a distinct apartment of the brain, 
made up of vessels similar, and like situated 
to the ideal, propositional, and 
syllogistical vessels, in the primary parts 
of the brain. After the same manner 
it is easy to explain the other modes of 
thinking; as also why some people 
think so wrong and perversely, which 
proceeds from the bad configuration of 
those Glands. Some for example, are 
born without the propositional or syllogistical 
Canals; in others, that reason 
ill, they are of unequal capacities; in 
dull fellows, of too great a length, 
whereby the motion of the spirits is retarded; 
in trifling geniuses, weak and 
small: in the over-refining spirits, too 
much intorted and winding; and so of 
the rest.</p>

<p>We are so much persuaded of the
truth of this our Hypothesis, that we 
have employed one of our Members, a

<!-- page 100 -->

great Virtuoso at Nuremberg, to make 
a sort of an Hydraulic Engine, in 
which a chemical liquor resembling 
Blood, is driven through elastic channels 
resembling Arteries and veins, by 
the force of an Embolus like the heart, 
and wrought by a pneumatic Machine 
of the nature of the lungs, with ropes 
and pullies, like the nerves, tendons and 
muscles: And we are persuaded that 
this our artificial Man will not only 
walk, and speak, and perform most of 
the outward actions of the animal life, 
but (being wound up once a week) 
will perhaps reason as well as most of 
your Country Parsons.</p>

<p>We wait with the utmost impatience 
for the honour of having you a 
Member of our Society, and beg leave 
to assure you that we are, etc.</p>

<br/>

<p>What return Martin made to this 
obliging Letter, we must defer to another 
occasion: let it suffice at present 
to tell, that Crambe was in a great rage 
at them, for stealing (as he thought) a 
hint from his <i>Theory of Syllogisms</i>, without

<!-- page 101 -->

doing him the honour so much as 
to mention him. He advised his 
Master by no means to enter into their 
Society, unless they would give him 
sufficient security, to bear him harmless 
from any thing that might happen 
after this present life.</p>

<p>CHAP. XIII.</p>

<p>The Double Mistress.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">[N. B. <i>The style of this Chapter in the</i> 
Original Memoirs <i>is so singularly different 
from the rest, that it is hard to 
conceive by whom it was penned. But 
if we consider the particular Regard 
which our Philosopher had for it, 
who expressly directed that</i> not one 
Word of this Chapter should be 
altered, <i>it will be natural to suspect that 
it was written by himself, at the Time 
when</i> Love <i>(ever delighting in</i> Romances<i>) 
had somewhat tinctured his 
Style; and that the Remains of his 
first and strongest Passion gave him a 
Partiality to this Memorial of it. 
Thus it begins</i>.]</p>

<p>BUT now the successful Course of 
the Studies of Martin was interrupted 
by <i>Love:</i> Love, that unnerves 
the Vigour of the Hero, and softens

<!-- page 103 -->

the Severity of the Philosopher. It 
chanced, that as Martin was walking 
forth to inhale the fresh breeze of the 
Evening, after the long and severe 
Studies of the day, and passing through 
the Western Confines of the famous 
Metropolis of Albion, not far from the 
proud Battlements of the Palace of 
Whitehall, whose walls are embraced 
by the silver Thames; his eyes were 
drawn upwards by a large square piece 
of Canvas, which hung forth to the view 
of the passing Citizens. Upon it was 
portrayed by some accurate pencil, the 
Libyan Leopard more fierce than in his 
native Desert; the mighty Lion, who 
boasted thrice the bulk of the Nem&aelig;an 
monster; before whom stood the little 
Jackal, the faithful spy of the King of 
beasts: Near these was placed, of two 
Cubits high, the black Prince of Monomotapa; 
by whose side were seen the 
glaring Cat-a-mountain, the quill-darting 
Porcupine, and the Man-mimicking 
Manteger. Close adjoining to this, 
hung another piece of Canvas on which 
was displayed the portrait of two Bohemian

<!-- page 104 -->

Damsels, whom Nature had as 
closely united as the ancient Hermaphroditus 
and Salmacis; and whom it 
was as impossible to divide, as the 
mingled waters of the gentle Thames 
and the amorous Isis. While Martin 
stood in a meditating posture, feasting 
his eyes on this Picture, he heard on a 
sudden the sonorous notes of a Clarion, 
which seemed of the purest crystal: In 
an instant the passing multitude flocked 
to the sound, as when a Drum summons 
the straggling soldiers to the approaching 
Battle. The youthful Virtuoso, 
who was in daily pursuit of the 
Curiosities of Nature, was immediately 
surrounded by the gazing throng. The 
doors, forever barred to the penniless 
populace, seemed to open themselves at 
his producing a silver Six-pence, which 
(like &AElig;neas's golden bough) gained 
him admission into that Scene of Wonders. 
He no sooner entered the first 
apartment, but his nostrils were struck 
with the scent of Carnage; broken 
Bones and naked Carcasses bestrewed 
the floor. The majestic Lion roused

<!-- page 105 -->

from his bed, and shook his brindled 
Mane; the spotted Leopard gnashed 
his angry teeth, and walking to and fro, 
in indignation rattled his chains. Martin 
with infinite pleasure heard the History 
of the several Monsters, which 
was courteously opened to him by a 
Person of a grave and earnest mien; 
whose frank behaviour and ready answers 
discovered him to have been long 
conversant with different Nations, and 
to have journeyed through distant Regions. 
By him he was informed, that 
the Lion was hunted on the hills of 
Lebanon, by the Basha of Jerusalem; 
that the Leopard was nursed in the uninhabited 
woods of Libya; the Porcupine 
came from the kingdom of Prester-John, 
and the Manteger was a true 
descendant of the celebrated Hanniman 
the Magnificent.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mr. Randal 
(for that was the name of the 
Master of the Show) "the whole World 
cannot match these prodigies: twice 
have I sailed round the Globe; these 
feet have traversed the most remote and 
barbarous nations; and I can with

<!-- page 106 -->

conscience affirm, that not all the Deserts 
of the four Quarters of the Earth 
furnish out a more complete set of Animals 
than what are contained within these 
walls."</p> 

<p>"Friend," (answered Martin) 
"bold is thy Assertion, and wonderful 
is the knowledge of a Traveller. But 
didst thou ever risk thyself among 
the Scythian Cannibals*, or those 
wild men of Abarimon, who walk 
with their feet backwards? hast thou 
ever seen the Sciopi, so called because 
when laid supine, they shelter themselves 
from the Sun-beams with the 
shadow of their feet? canst thou procure 
me a Troglodyte footman, who 
can catch a Roe at his full speed? hast 
thou ever beheld those Illyrian damsels 
who have two sights in one eye, whose 
looks are poisonous to males that are 
adult? hast thou ever measured the gigantic 
Ethiopian, whose stature is above 
eight cubits high, or the sesquipedalian 
Pigmy? hast thou ever seen 
any of the Cynocephali, who have the

<!-- page 107 -->

head and voice of a Dog, and whose 
milk† is the only true specific for 
Consumptions?"</p>

<p class="small">[*Pliny lib. 7. cap. 2.]</p>

<p class="small">[†Pliny 16.]</p>

<p>"Sir," (replied Mr. Randal) 
"all these have I beheld, upon my 
honour, and many more which are set 
forth in my Journal: As for your dog-faced 
men, they are no other than what 
stands before you; that is naturally the 
fiercest, but by art the tamest Manteger 
in the world."</p>

<p>"That word," (replies 
Martin) "is a corruption of the Mantichora* 
of the Ancients, the most noxious 
Animal that ever infested the earth; 
who had a Sting above a cubit long, 
and would attack a rank of armed men 
at once, flinging his poisonous darts several 
miles around him. Canst thou 
inform me whether the Boars grunt in 
Macedonia? Canst thou give me a 
Certificate that the Lions in Africa 
are afraid of the scolding of Women? 
hast thou ever heard the sagacious 
Hyena counterfeit the voice of a 
shepherd, imitate the vomiting of a

<!-- page 108 -->

man to draw the dogs together, and 
even call a shepherd by his proper name? 
Your Crocodile is but a small one, but 
you ought to have brought with him 
the bird Trochilos that picks his teeth 
after dinner, at which the silly animal 
is so pleased, that he gapes wide enough 
to give the Ichneumon, his mortal enemy, 
an entrance into his belly. 
Your modern Ostriches are dwindled to 
mere Larks in comparison with those 
of the Ancients; theirs were equal in 
stature to a man on horseback. Alas! 
we have lost the chaste bird Porphyrion! 
the whole Race was destroyed by Women, 
because they discovered the infidelity 
of wives to their husbands. The Merops 
too is now nowhere to be found, 
the only bird that flew backward by 
the tail. But say, canst thou inform 
me, what Dialect of the Greek is spoken 
by the birds of Diomedes' island? 
for it is from them only we can learn 
the true pronunciation of that ancient 
language."</p>

<p class="small">[*&AElig;lian. lib. 4. cap. 2. 
Pliny lib. 11. cap 51. Pliny lib. 8. cap. 30. lib. 8. cap. 25. 
&AElig;lian lib. 3. cap. 42. &AElig;lian. lib. 1. cap. 49. &AElig;lian. lib 1. cap. 2.]</p>

<p>Mr. Randal made no satisfactory 
answer to these demands, but harangued chiefly upon modern Monsters,

<!-- page 109 -->

and seemed willing to confine his instances 
to the Animals of his own collection, 
pointing to each of them in 
order with his Rod.</p>

<p>After Martin had satisfied his curiosity 
here, he was conducted into another 
Apartment. Just at the entrance 
of the door appeared a Negro Prince. 
His habiliments bespoke him royal; 
his head was crowned with the feather 
of an Ostrich, his sable feet and legs 
were interlaced with Purple and Gold, 
spangled with the Diamonds of Cornwall, 
and the precious stones of Bristol. 
Though his stature was of the lowest, 
yet he behaved himself with such an 
Air of Grandeur, as gave evident tokens 
of his Regal Birth and Education. 
He was mounted upon the least Palfrey 
in the Universe; a Palfrey whose natural 
Beauty stood not in need of those 
various coloured Ribbons which braided 
his Mane, and were interwoven with 
his Tail. Again the crystal Clarion 
sounded, and after several courteous 
speeches between the black Prince and 
Martin, our youthful Philosopher

<!-- page 110 -->

walked into the midst of the room, to 
bless his sight with the most beautiful 
Curiosity of Nature. On a sudden entered 
at another door the two Bohemian 
Sisters, whose common parts of Generation, 
had so closely allied them, 
that Nature seemed here to have conspired 
with Fortune, that their lives 
should run in an eternal Parallel.</p>

<p>The Sun had twice eight times performed 
his annual course, since their 
Mother brought them into the world 
with double pangs. Lindamira's eyes 
were of a lively blue; Indamora's were 
black and piercing. Lindamira's cheeks 
might rival the blush of the morning; 
in Indamora the Lily overcame the 
Rose. Lindamira's tresses were of the 
paler Gold, while the locks of Indamora 
were black and glossy as the 
Plumes of a Raven.</p>

<p>How great is the power of Love in 
human breasts! In vain has the Wise 
man recourse to his Reason, when the 
insinuating Arrow touches his heart, 
and the pleasing poison is diffused 
through his veins. But then how violent,

<!-- page 111 -->

how transporting must that passion 
prove, where not only the Fire of 
Youth, but the unquenchable Curiosity 
of a Philosopher, pitched upon the 
same object! For how much soever 
our Martin was enamoured on her as a 
beautiful Woman, he was infinitely 
more ravished with her as a charming 
Monster. What wonder then, if his 
gentle Spirit, already humanized by a 
polite Education to receive all soft impressions, 
and fired by the sight of 
those beauties so lavishly exposed to his 
view, should prove unable to resist at 
once so pleasing a Passion, and so amiable 
a Phenomenon?</p>

<p>Martin, who felt the true emotions 
of Love, blushed that the Object of 
his flame should be so openly prostituted 
to vulgar eyes. And though he 
had been permitted to peruse her most 
secret charms, yet his honourable passion 
was so strong, that it ran into the 
extreme of bashfulness; so that at the 
first interview he made no Overtures of 
his Love. Pensive he returned, and 
flinging himself on his Couch, passed

<!-- page 112 -->

away the tedious hours of the night in the 
utmost Inquietude. The rushy 
Taper afforded a glimmering light, by 
which he contemplated the tender lines 
of Ovid; but alas! his Remedy of Love 
was no cure for our unhappy Lover's 
Anxiety! He closed the amorous volume, 
sighed, and casting his eyes around 
on the Books that adorned his 
room, broke forth in this pathetic Apostrophe.</p>

<p>"O ye Spirits of Antiquity, who yet 
live in those sacred leaves! why do I 
make you conscious of my shame? Yet 
why should I depreciate the noble Passion 
of Love, and call it Shame? your 
Heroes have felt it, your Poets and Orators 
have praised it. Were I enamoured 
on some gaudy Virgin, did I 
dote on vulgar Perfection, the Lustre 
of an Eye, or the Rose of a Cheek; 
with reason might I blush before you, 
most learned Inquisitors into Nature! 
most reverend Pliny, &AElig;lian, and Aldrovandus! 
Yet sure you cannot disapprove 
of this, which is no wanton Passion, 
but excited by so unparalleled a

<!-- page 113 -->

Production; a flame, that may not only 
justify itself to the Severity of a Philosopher, 
but even to the Avarice of a 
Parent; since she who causes it carries 
a most plentiful Fortune in the sole Exhibition 
of her person. Heavens! 
how I wonder at the Stupidity of mankind, 
who can affix the opprobrious 
Name of Monstrosity to what is only 
Variety of Beauty, and a Profusion of 
generous Nature? If there are charms 
in one face, one mouth, one body; if 
there are charms in two eyes, two 
breasts, two arms; are they not all redoubled 
in the Object of my Passion? 
What though she be the common Gaze of 
the multitude, and is followed about by 
the stupid and ignorant; does she not 
herein resemble the greatest Princes, 
and the greatest Beauties? only with 
this difference, that her Admirers are 
more numerous, and more lasting."</p>

<p>Thus sighed he away the melancholy 
Night; but no sooner had Aurora, 
with blushes in her cheeks (as conscious 
that she was just risen from the 
embraces of Tithon) advanced through

<!-- page 114 -->

the purple gates of the east, but Martin 
rose: He rose indeed, but Melancholy, 
the companion of his slumbers, 
rose and waked with him. This was 
the first day that he amused himself 
with the gaudy Ornaments of the body; 
that with secret pleasure he contemplated 
his Face, and the symmetry 
of his limbs in a looking-glass. And 
now forsaking his solitary apartment, 
he walked directly to the habitation 
that confined the Object of his desires. 
But as it is observed that the Curious 
never wander into the City to indulge 
their thirst of knowledge till about 
the hours of eleven or twelve; the Morning 
has ever been the season of Repose 
for all those Animals, who (trapanned 
by the frauds of Men) have been obliged 
to change their Woods and Wildernesses 
for Lodgings in Cities at the 
rate of four shillings a week. Therefore 
Martin at this early hour was neither 
saluted by the sound of the Trumpet, 
nor were his eyes feasted as before 
with the pleasing picture of his Mistress; 
but he walked to and fro before

<!-- page 115 -->

the door with folded arms, from the 
hour of five to eleven, humming in a 
low and melancholy tune.</p>

<p>The Trumpet no sooner sounded, 
but his heart leapt for joy, and a second 
six-pence gained him a second admittance 
into her apartment. Yet this 
day also, he only owned his Passion in 
the language of his Eyes: But alas! 
this language is only understood by those 
that love, and Lindamira remained still 
ignorant of his Passion.</p>

<p>In the mean time it was no small 
cause of wonder to Mr. Randal, that 
this Gentleman should come every day 
to behold the same show. He, no less 
covetous than the Guardian of a rich 
Heiress, entertained a suspicion that 
Martin had a design of stealing the Ladies. 
He thereupon issued out strict 
Orders, not to admit our Lover on any 
pretence whatsoever. What Torments 
must this occasion in the raging fever 
of Love! Martin had now recourse to 
Stratagem, and by a Bribe (which often 
even the Ermine and Scarlet Robe 
cannot resist) gained the Dwarf who

<!-- page 116 -->

kept the gates of the Show-room, to 
promote his Amour. He promised to 
convey a Letter to Lindamira the same 
evening, if he would bring it him 
when darkness favoured his design, at 
the apartment next the Monsters. Martin 
overjoyed, hasted home, and after 
having consulted all the Authors 
that treat of Love, composed his Billet-doux, 
and at the time appointed went 
to entrust it to the hands of his Confidant. 
Softly he stole up stairs, approached 
the door, and gave a gentle rap; when 
on a sudden a small hand was thrust 
through a little hole at the bottom of 
the door, whence issued an unintelligible, 
squeaking voice. Martin concluding 
it to be the Signal, delivered 
his Epistle, and made his retreat unobserved. 
He was no sooner retired, but 
Mr. Randal entered, and (as it was his 
usual custom before he went to bed) 
took a view if all were safe in the 
Show-room. At his coming in, he 
saw his Monkey exceedingly busy in 
picking the Seal-wax by little bits from 
a Letter, which he turned over and over

<!-- page 117 -->

with infinite satisfaction. Mr. 
Randal, not thinking it a breach of 
honour to pry into the secrets of his 
own family, took the Letter from him, 
and read as follows.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>To the most amiable</i> <span class="smcap">Lindamira</span>,</p>

<p>WHILE others, O darling of Nature, 
look upon thee with the 
eyes of Curiosity, I behold thee with 
those of Love. Since I have been 
struck with thy most astonishing 
Charms, how have I called upon Nature 
to make a new head, new arms, 
and a new body to sprout from this 
single Trunk of mine, and to double 
every member, so to render me a 
proper Mate for so lovely a Pair! 
but think to how little purpose it will 
be for thee to stay till Nature shall 
form another of thy kind! In such 
beauties she exhausts her whole art, 
and cannot afford to be prodigal. Ages 
must be numbered, nay perhaps some 
Comet may vitrify this Globe on which 
we tread, before we behold a Castor

<!-- page 118 -->

and a Pollux resembling the beauteous 
Lindamira and Indamora. Nature 
forms her wonders for the Wise, and 
such a Master-piece she could design 
for none but a Philosopher. Cease 
then to display those beauties to the 
profane Vulgar, which were created 
to crown the desires of</p>

<p class="right">Your Passionate Admirer,</p> 

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Martinus Scriblerus</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>The Dwarf entered as he was reading 
the Letter, and perceiving his Master 
moved with passion, immediately 
fell on his knees and confessed the 
whole affair. Mr. Randal bent on revenge, 
caused him to hasten to Martin's 
house, with assurances that Lindamira 
had read his Letter with infinite 
satisfaction, and conjured him that he 
would immediately favour her escape. 
Martin overjoyed at the news, flew thither 
on the Wings of Love. The perfidious 
Dwarf conducted him up stairs 
in the dark, gently opened the door,

<!-- page 119 -->

and bade him enter. How happy was 
Martin in that instant, who thought 
of nothing but leaping into the four 
soft arms of his Mistress! when lo, on 
a sudden he saw at the further end of 
the Room two glittering balls of Fire, 
which rolled to and fro in a most terrible 
manner. Immediately his ears were 
invaded with horrid hissings and spittings, 
the balls of Fire drew nearer 
him, and the noise redoubled as he approached. 
Our Philosopher bold and 
resolute with love, ventured towards it; 
when all at once he perceived something 
grasp him hard by the throat, and fix 
as it were sharp lances in his cheek, so 
that blood trickled amain down his chin. 
Thrice Martin essayed to free himself, 
but vain were all his endeavours: till 
at length, to save his life, he was forced 
to betray his Intrigue, and alarm 
the house with reiterated cries of Murder. 
The apartment of the Bohemian 
Beauties being the adjoining Room, 
they were the first that entered with a 
light to his assistance. Martin all bloody 
as he was, a most fierce Cat-a-mountain

<!-- page 120 -->

hanging at his chin, (which Mr. 
Randal had maliciously placed there on 
purpose) at the sight of Lindamira 
forgot his distress.</p>

<p>"Ah, my Love!" (he 
cried) "how like is thy fate to that of 
Thisbe! who staying but a moment too 
late, found, as she thought, her miserable 
Lover torn in pieces by a Savage 
beast!"</p>

<p>The affrighted Damsels shrieked 
aloud, Mr. Randal with all his Retinue 
rushed into the room, and now every 
hand conspired to free his under-jaw 
from the sharp teeth of the enraged
Monster. But the Lady, whose heart 
melted at the piteous Spectacle, was so 
zealous in this office of Humanity, that 
the Cat-a-mountain, provoked at her 
good-natured diligence, leaped furiously 
on her, and wounded three of her hands 
and her two noses, to such a barbarous 
degree that she was not fit to be shown 
publicly for the space of three weeks. 
The generous Lover, more wounded 
at this Spectacle than at all the scratches 
he had himself received, charged the 
monster again with the utmost Intrepidity, 
and rescued his mangled Mistress.

<!-- page 121 -->

Then (having taken her by the hand, 
and given it a gentle grasp) he retreated 
with his eye fixed upon her, and just 
as he left the room (in a low and tender 
Accent) thus breathed forth his 
Soul. 

"<i>Behold, all this have I suffered 
for you</i>."</p>

<p>Such, and so modest was the first 
Declaration of Love, made on this eminent 
occasion by our youthful Philosopher. 
Nor was it ungently received by 
the simple and innocent Lindamira; 
who hitherto unused to the soft Protestations 
of adoring Slaves, had rather 
been wondered at than beloved; and received 
but imperfect notions of that tender 
language, from the Addresses only 
of the black Prince or the Dwarf.</p>

<p>Martin, notwithstanding this unfortunate 
adventure, still pursued his 
wishes. His Letters were now no 
more intercepted. Lindamira read 
them, and behaved like other courteous 
dames when they receive those amorous 
Testimonials; concealed them 
from her Guardian, and returned the 
most engaging answers. In short, she

<!-- page 122 -->

was so far captivated, as to resolve no 
longer to be gazed at like a public 
Beauty in her own Assembly; but retire 
from the world, and become the 
virtuous Mistress of a Family.</p>

<p>But Fate had so ordained, that Martin 
was not more enamoured on Lindamira, 
than Indamora was on Martin. 
She, jealous that her Sister had the 
greatest share in this conquest, resented 
that an equal application had not been 
made to herself. She teased Lindamira 
to such a degree on this subject, as 
made her promise to see Martin no 
more. But then again might Indamora 
be deemed the unhappiest of Women, 
whom her Passion and Imprudence had 
robbed of the sight of her Lover. Yet 
shame caused her to conceal those anxieties 
from her Sister. And let the Reader 
judge how unhappy the Nymph 
must be, who was even deprived the 
universal Relief of a <i>Soliloquy</i>. However, 
thus she thought, without being 
allowed to tell it to any Grove or purling 
Stream.</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>"Wretched Indamora! if Lindamira 
must never more see Martin, Martin 
shall never again bless the eyes of Indamora: 
Yet why do I say wretched? 
since my Rival can never possess my 
Lover without me. The pangs that 
others feel in Absence, from the thought 
of those Joys that bless their Rivals, 
can never sting thy bosom; nor can 
they mortify thee by making thee a 
Witness, without giving thee at the 
same time a share of their Endearments. 
Change then thy proceeding, Indamora; 
thy Jealousy must act a new 
and unheard-of part, and promote the 
interest of thy Rival, as the only way 
to the enjoyment of thy Lover."</p>

<p>From that moment she studied by all 
methods to advance her Sister's Amour, 
and in that her own. And thus there 
appeared in these three Lovers as extraordinary 
a Conjunction of Passions 
as of Persons: Love had reconciled 
himself to his mortal foes, to Philosophy 
in Martin, and to Jealousy in Indamora.</p>

<!-- page 124 -->

<p>And now flourished the Amour of 
Martin; Success even prevented his 
wishes; the Marriage was agreed on, 
and the day appointed. Sunday was 
the time when Mr. Randal's Absence 
favoured their hopes, who never on that 
day, omitted taking the fresh air in the 
fields: The key of the door he always 
took with him. <i>Crambe</i> was ready 
laid at a convenient distance, who accommodated 
them with a ladder of 
ropes. The ladder was thrown up, and 
the Signal given at the window. Lindamira 
hastened to the Alarm of Love, 
when behold a new Disaster! As she 
was getting out of the window, the 
weight of her body on one side, and 
that of Indamora's on the other, unluckily 
caused them to stick in the midway: 
Lindamira hung with her coats 
stripped up to the navel without, and Indamora 
in no less immodest posture 
within. The <i>Manteger</i>, who for his 
gentleness was allowed to walk at large 
in the house, was so heightened at this 
sight, that he rushed upon Indamora 
like a barbarous Ravisher. Indamora

<!-- page 125 -->

cried aloud for help. Martin flew to 
revenge this insolent attempt, of a Rape 
on his wedding-day. The lustful Monster, 
driven from our double Lucrece, 
fled into the middle of the room, pursued 
by the valorous and indignant 
Martin. Three times the hot Manteger, 
frighted at the furious menaces of 
his Antagonist, made a circle round the 
chamber, and three times the swift-footed 
Martin pursued him. He caught 
up the <i>Horn</i> of a <i>Unicorn</i>, which lay 
ready for the entertainment of the curious 
spectator, and brandishing it over 
his head in airy circles, hurled it against 
the hairy son of Hanniman; who 
wrinkling his brown forehead, and 
gnashing his teeth in indignation, 
stooped low: The horny Lance just 
razed his left shoulder, and stuck into 
the tapestry hangings. Provoked at this 
the grinning Offspring of Hanniman 
caught up the pointed <i>Horn</i> of an <i>Antelope</i>, 
and aimed a blow against his undismayed 
Adversary. Our heroic Lover, 
who held his hat before him like 
a shield, received the weapon full on

<!-- page 126 -->

the Crown; it pierced the beaver, and 
gave a small rent to his breeches. Then 
the human Champion flung with mighty 
violence the hinder <i>foot</i> of an <i>Elk</i>, 
which hit the bestial Combatant full 
on the nether jaw. He reeled, but 
soon recovering, and his skill in war 
lying rather in the close fight than in 
projectile weapons, he endeavoured to 
close with him: Forthwith assailing 
him behind unawares, he clambered 
up his back, and plucked up by the 
roots a mighty grasp of hair&mdash;but 
Martin soon dismounted him, and kept 
him at a distance. Love not only inspired 
his breast with Courage, but gave 
double strength to his sinews; he heaved 
up the <i>hand</i> of a prodigious <i>Sea-Monster;</i> 
which when the chattering Champion 
beheld, he no less furious, wielded 
the ponderous <i>Thigh-bone</i> of a <i>Giant</i>. 
And now they stood opposed to each 
other, like the dread Captain of the 
sevenfold Shield and the redoubted 
Hector. The Thigh-bone missed its 
aim; but the hand of the Sea-Monster 
descended directly on the head of

<!-- page 127 -->

the Sylvian Ravisher. The Monster 
chattered horribly; he stretched his 
quivering limbs on the floor; and eternal 
sleep locked fast his eyelids.</p>

<p>The Lady from the window, like 
another Helen from the Trojan wall, 
was witness of the Combat caused by 
her own beauty. She saw with what 
gracefulness her Hero entered the Lists, 
admired his activity and courage in the 
combat, and was a joyful witness of 
his Triumph: She gave a spring from 
the window, and with open arms and 
legs embraced the neck and shoulders 
of her Champion. Our Philosopher 
received her with his face turned modestly 
from her, and in that manner 
conveyed her into the street. He called 
a Chair with all haste, but no chairman 
would take her; which obliged him 
to bear his extraordinary burden till he 
found a Coach, in which he carried 
her off, and was happily united to her 
that very evening, by a Reverend Clergyman 
in the Fleet, in the holy Bands 
of Matrimony.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAP. XIV.</p>

<p>Of the strange, and never to be parallelled 
Process at Law upon the Marriage 
of Scriblerus, and the Pleadings of the Advocates.</p>

</div>

<p>BUT <i>Nemesis</i>, who delights in traversing 
the best-laid designs of 
Cupid, maliciously contrived the means 
to make these three Lovers unhappy. 
No sooner had the Master of the Show 
received notice of their flight, but he 
seized on the Bohemian Ladies by a 
<i>Warrant;</i> and not content with having 
recovered the Possession of them, resolved 
to open all the Sluices of the 
<i>Law</i> upon Martin. So he instantly 
went to Council to advise upon all possible 
methods of revenge.</p>

<p>The first point he proceeded on was 
the <i>Property</i> of his Monster, and the 
question propounded was, "Whether

<!-- page 129 -->

Slaves could marry without the 
consent of their Master?" (1) To this 
he was answered in the Affirmative, 
but told at the same time, "That 
the Marriage did not exempt them 
from Servitude." (2)</p>

<p class="small">[1 <i>An Servi possint invitis Dominis Matrimonium contrahere?</i>]</p>

<p class="small">[2 <i>An Servus Matrimonio eximitur a Domini obsequio?</i>]</p>

<p>This put him in no small hopes of having 
Martin added to his <i>Show</i>, and 
acquiring a property in his <i>Bodily issue</i> 
by the Ladies. But his joy was soon 
dashed, when he was informed, that 
since Martin was a Free Man,
"The children must follow the condition 
of the Father: or, that indeed, 
if they were to follow that of 
their Mother, the Case would be the 
same, there being no slavery in England." (3)</p>

<p class="small">[3 <i>An Liberi sequuntur conditionem Patris, an Matris?</i>]</p>

<p>Then his Counsel judged it more adviseable 
to plead for a <i>Dissolution</i> of the 
<i>Marriage</i>, upon the impossibility of 
Conjugal dues in the Wife. But then 
the <i>Canon Law</i> allowed a <i>Triennal Cohabitation</i>, 
which entirely ruined this

<!-- page 130 -->

Project also. Besides it was evident by 
the same Law, that "Monstrosity could 
not incapacitate from Marriage,"
witness the Case of Hermaphrodites, 
who are allowed "<i>Facultatem Conjugii</i>, 
provided they <i>make Election</i> before 
the <i>Parish Priest</i>, in <i>what sex</i> they 
will act, and take an Oath never to 
perform in the other capacity." (1)</p>

<p class="small">[1 Sanchez. Hostiens. Sylvest.]</p>

<p>It was next consulted whether Martin 
should not be permitted to <i>take away</i> 
his Wife? since upon his so doing
"he might be sued for a <i>Rape</i> upon 
the body of her <i>Sister</i>, there being 
plainly the <i>four conditions</i> of a 
Rape." (2) But then again they considered, 
that Martin might answer he 
claimed nothing but his own; and if 
another person had fixed herself to his 
Wife, he must not for that cause be 
debarred the use of his Property.</p>

<p class="small">[2 <i>Violentia, Causa Libidinis, Traductio ad Locum, 
Mulier honesta</i>.]</p>

<p>Yet still, upon the same head of 
Martin's possessing his spouse, a Suit 
might be devised in the name of Lindamira,

<!-- page 131 -->

on this account; That a
"<i>Wife</i> was not obliged to live with a 
<i>Concubine</i>, (3) and such her Sister Indamora 
must be accounted to Martin 
from the common Proofs. (4)" To 
this too it was replied, that the Law 
ordered the Wife to <i>reside</i> with the <i>Husband</i> 
if there were sufficient security 
given to expel the Concubine. So 
Martin might say he was ready to accomplish 
his part of the Covenant, if 
his wife would perform hers, and consent 
to the Incision. (5) But this being 
an impossibility on the side of the 
Wife, it could no way be exacted of 
the Husband.</p>

<p class="small">[3 <i>Uxor non tenetur vivere cum viro Concubinam tenente</i>.]</p>

<p class="small">[4 <i>Tactus, amplexus, cohabitatio</i>.]</p>

<p class="small">[5 <i>An Uxor tenetur Incisionem pati? Sanchez de Matrimonio</i>.]</p>

<p>At length Mr. Randal, being vexed at 
the heart, to have been so long and so 
quaintly disappointed, determined to 
commence a Suit against Martin for 
<i>Bigamy</i> and <i>Incest</i>. Meanwhile he 
left no Artifice or Address untried to

<!-- page 132 -->

perplex the unhappy Philosopher: He 
even contrived with infinite cunning, to 
alienate Indamora's affections from him; 
and debauched her into an Intrigue with 
a Creature, of his own, the black 
Prince; whom he secretly caused to 
marry her, while her Sister was <i>asleep</i>.</p>

<p>Hereupon Martin was reduced to turn 
<i>Plaintiff</i>, and commenced a Suit in the 
<i>Spiritual Court</i> against the black Prince, 
for Cohabitation with his said wife. 
He was advised to insist upon a new 
Point, (viz.) "That Lindamira and 
Indamora <i>together</i> made up but <i>one</i> 
lawful wife."</p>

<p>The Monster-master, further to distress 
Martin, forced Lindamira to petition 
for Aliment, <i>lite pendente:</i> which 
was no sooner allowed her by the Court, 
but he obliged her to allege, that "it 
was not sufficient to maintain both 
herself and her Sister; and if her 
Sister perished, she could not live 
with the dead body about her."</p>

<p>Martin now began to repent that he 
had not executed a resolution he formerly 
conceived, of marrying <i>Crambe</i>

<!-- page 133 -->

to Indamora, as an Expedient to have 
made all secure. Moreover, it was insisted 
on, that the other also had a 
right to <i>Aliment</i>, "because if Martin's 
Wife should prove with child, the 
said Sister must necessarily perform 
the <i>Offices</i> of a <i>wife</i>, in contributing 
to the <i>Nutrition</i> and <i>Gestation</i> of the 
said child." A Jury of Physicians 
being impanneled, declared, that as to 
Nutrition they were doubtful, whether 
any blood of Lindamira circulated 
through Indamora: But as to Gestation, 
it was evidently true. And upon 
this, Martin was ordered to allow Aliment 
to both, the Black Prince appearing 
<i>insolvent</i>.</p>

<p>Then the Court proceeded to the 
Trial. And as both the Cause and 
the Pleadings are of an extraordinary 
Nature, we think fit here to insert 
them at length.</p>

<p>Dr. Penny-feather thus pleaded for 
Martinus Scriblerus the Plaintiff.</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p class="center">Dr. <span class="smcap">Penny-feather</span>.</p>

<p>"I appear before your Honour in 
behalf of Martinus Scriblerus, Bachelor 
of Physic, in a Complaint against 
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, commonly 
called the black Prince of 
Monomotapa; Inasmuch as the said 
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, hath maliciously, 
forcibly, and unlawfully seized, 
ravished, and detained Lindamira-Indamora, 
the wife of the said Martin, 
and the body of the said Lindamira-Indamora, 
from time to time ever 
since, hath wickedly, lewdly, and 
indecently used, handled, and evil 
entreated. And in order to make 
this his Villainy more lasting, hath 
presumed to marry this our Wife, 
pretending to give his wickedness the 
Sanction of a Law. And forasmuch 
as the Adulterer doth not deny the 
fact, but insists upon his said Marriage 
as lawful, we cannot open the 
Case more plainly to your Honour, 
than by answering his Reasons, 
which indeed, to mention, is to 
confute.</p>

<!-- page 135 -->

<p>"He maintains no less an absurdity 
than this, that <i>One</i> is <i>Two;</i> and that 
Lindamira-Indamora, the individual 
wife of the Plaintiff, is not one, but 
two Persons: And that the said Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw 
is not married to 
Lindamira, the wife of the said 
Martin, but to his own lawful wife 
Indamora, another individual Person 
distinct from the said Lindamira, 
though joined to her by a strong Ligament 
of Nature.</p>

<p>"In answer whereunto, we shall prove 
three things: <i>First</i>, that the said 
Lindamira-Indamora, now our lawful 
wife, makes but one individual 
person.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, that if they made two 
individual persons, yet they constitute 
but one wife.</p>

<p>"<i>Thirdly</i>, that supposing they made 
two individual persons, and two 
wives, each lawfully married to her 
own husband, yet Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw 
hath no right to detain Lindamira our lawfully wedded wife,

<!-- page 136 -->

on pretence of being married to Indamora.</p>

<p>"As to the first point: It will be 
necessary to determine the <i>constituent 
Principle</i> and <i>Essence</i> of <i>Individuality</i>, 
which in respect of mankind, we take 
to be one simple identical soul, in 
one simple identical body. The individuality, 
sameness, or identity of 
the body, is not determined (as some 
vainly imagine) by one head, and a 
certain number of arms, legs, and 
other members; but in one simple, 
single 'αιδοῖον, or member of Generation.</p>

<p>"Let us search Profane History, 
and we shall find Geryon with three 
heads, and Briareus with an hundred 
hands. Let us search Sacred History, 
and we meet with one of the 
sons of the Giants with six Fingers 
to each Hand, and six Toes to each 
Foot; yet none never accounted 
Geryon or Briareus more than one 
Person: and give us leave to say, the 
wife of the said Geryon would have 
had a good action against any women

<!-- page 137 -->

who should have espoused themselves 
to the two other heads of that Monarch. 
The Reason is plain; because 
each of these having but one 
simple 'αιδοῖον, or one member of Generation, 
could be looked upon but 
as one single person.</p>

<p>"In conformity to this, when we 
behold this one member, we distinguish 
the Sex, and pronounce it a 
<i>Man</i>, or a <i>Woman</i>; or, as the Latins 
express it, <i>unus Vir</i>, <i>una Mulier</i>, 
<i>une Homme</i>, <i>une Femme</i>, <i>One Man</i>, 
<i>One Woman</i>. For the same Reason 
Man and Wife are said to be one 
Flesh, because united in that part 
which constitutes the Sameness and 
Individuality of each sex.</p>

<p>"And as where there is but one 
Member of Generation, there is but 
one Body, so there can be but one 
Soul; because the said Organ of Generation 
is the Seat of the Soul; and 
consequently where there is but one 
such Organ, there can be but one 
Soul. Let me here say without injury 
to truth, that no Philosopher,

<!-- page 138 -->

either of the past or present age, 
hath taken more pains to discover 
where the Soul keeps her residence, 
than the Plaintiff, the learned Martinus 
Scriblerus: And after his most 
diligent enquiries and experiments, 
he hath been verily persuaded, that 
the Organ of Generation is the true 
and only <i>Seat of the Soul</i>. That this 
part is seated in the middle, and near 
the Center of the whole Body, is 
obvious to your Honour's view. 
From thence, like the Sun in the 
Center of the world, the Soul dispenses 
her warmth and vital influence: 
Let the Brain glory in the 
Wisdom of the aged, the Science of 
the learned, the Policy of the statesman, 
and the Invention of the witty; 
the accidental Amusements and Emanations 
of the Soul, and mortal 
as the Possessors of them! It is to 
the Organs of Generation that we 
owe Man himself; there the Soul is 
employed in works suitable to the 
Dignity of her Nature, and (as we

<!-- page 139 -->

may say) sits brooding over ages yet 
unborn."</p>

<p>"We need not tell your Honour, 
that it has been the opinion of many 
most learned Divines and Philosophers, 
that the Soul, as well as Body, 
is produced <i>Ex Traduce</i>. This 
doctrine has been defended by arguments 
irrefragable, and accounts for 
difficulties, without it, inexplicable. 
All which arguments conclude with 
equal strength, for the Soul's being 
seated in the Organs of Generation. 
For since the whole man, both Soul 
and Body, is <i>there</i> formed, and since 
nothing can operate but where it <i>is</i>, 
it follows that the Soul must reside 
in that individual place, where she 
exerts her generative and plastic 
Powers.</p>

<p>"This our Doctrine is confirmed by 
all those Experiments, which conspire 
to prove the absolute Dominion 
which that part hath over the whole 
Body. We see how many Women, 
who are deaf to the persuasions of 
the Eloquent, the insinuations of the

<!-- page 140 -->

Crafty, and the threats of the Imperious, 
are easily governed by some 
poor Logger-head, unfurnished with 
the least art, but that of making 
immediate application to this <i>Seat 
of the Soul</i>. The impressions made 
by the Ear are so distant, and transmitted 
through so many windings, that 
they lose their Energy: But your 
Honour, by immediately applying 
to the Organ of Generation, acts like 
a bold and wise Petitioner, who goes 
straight to the <i>very Throne</i> and <i>Judgment-Seat</i> 
of the Monarch.</p>

<p>"And whereas it is objected, that 
here are <i>two Wills</i>, and therefore <i>two</i> 
different <i>Persons;</i> we answer, if 
Multiplicity of Wills implied multiplicity 
of Persons, there are few Husbands but what are guilty of 
<i>Polygamy</i>, there being in the same 
Woman great and notorious diversity 
of Wills: A Point which we shall 
not need to insist upon before any 
married person, much less of your 
Honour's Experience.</p>

<!-- page 141 -->

<p>"Thus have we made good our first 
and principal Point; That if the wife 
of the Plaintiff, Lindamira-Indamora, 
hath but <i>one</i> Organ of Generation, 
she is but <i>one individual Person</i>, 
in the truest and most proper sense of 
Individuality. And that the matter 
of Fact is so, we are willing to put 
upon a fair Trial by a Jury of Matrons, 
whom your Honour shall 
think fit to nominate and appoint, 
to inspect the body of the said Lindamira-Indamora.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, we are to prove, that though 
Lindamira-Indamora were 
<i>two</i> individual Persons, consisting 
each of a Soul and Body, yet if they 
have but one Organ of Generation, 
they can constitute but one Wife. 
For, from whence can the <i>Unity</i> of 
any thing be denominated, but from 
that which <i>constitutes</i> the <i>Essence</i> or 
principal <i>Use</i> of it? Thus, if a Knife 
or Hatchet have but one blade, 
though two handles, it will properly 
be denominated but one Knife, or 
one Hatchet; inasmuch as it hath

<!-- page 142 -->

but one of that which constitutes 
the Essence or principal Use of a 
Knife or Hatchet. So if there were 
not only one, but twenty <i>Supposita 
Rationalia</i> with one common Organ 
of Generation, that one System 
would only make one Wife. Upon 
the whole, let not a few Heads, 
Legs, or Arms extraordinary, bias 
your Honour's Judgment, and deprive 
the Plaintiff of his legal Property: 
In which right our Client is 
so strongly fortified, that allowing 
both the former Propositions to be 
false, and that there were two Persons, 
two Bodies, two Rational Souls, 
yea, and two Organs of Generation, 
yet would it still be plain in the 
third place,</p>

<p>"That the Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, 
can have no Right 
to detain from the Plaintiff, his lawfully 
wedded <i>Wife</i>, Lindamira. 
For, abstracting from the <i>Priority</i> 
of the marriage of our Client, by 
which it would seem he acquired a 
property in his Wife and <i>all other

<!-- page 143 -->

Matter inseparably annexed unto her</i>, 
it is evident Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, 
by his marriage to Indamora, 
could never acquire any property in 
Lindamira; nor can produce any 
Cause why both of them should live 
with himself, rather than with the 
other? Therefore, we humbly hope 
your Honour will order the body of 
Our said Wife to be restored to us, 
and due Censure passed on the said 
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw."</p>

<p>Dr. Penny-feather having thus ended 
his Pleading, was thus answered by</p>

<p class="center">Dr. <span class="smcap">Leatherhead</span>.</p>

<p>"I will not trouble your Honour 
with any unnecessary Preamble, or 
false Colours of Eloquence, which 
Truth hath no need of, and which 
would prove too thin a Veil for 
Falsehood before the penetrating eyes 
of your Honour. In answer therefore 
to what our learned brother, Dr. 
Penny-feather hath asserted, we 
shall labour to demonstrate,</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>"<i>First</i>, That though there were 
but one Organ of Generation, yet 
are there two distinct persons.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, That although there were 
but one Organ of Generation, so far 
would it be from giving the Plaintiff 
any right to the body of Indamora, 
the wife of Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, 
that it will subject the Plaintiff to the 
penalty of Incest, or of Bigamy.</p>

<p>"<i>Thirdly</i>, We doubt not to prove 
that the said Lindamira-Indamora 
hath two distinct parts of Generation.</p>

<p>"And <i>First</i> we will show, that neither 
the individual Essence of mankind, 
nor the Seat of the Soul, doth 
reside in the Organ of Generation; 
and this first from Reason. For unreasonable 
indeed must it be, to 
make that the Seat of the Rational 
Soul, which alone sets us on a level 
with beasts: or to conceive, that the 
Essence of Unity and Individuality 
should consist in that which is the 
Source of Discord and Division. In 
a word, what can be a greater absurdity, 
than to affirm Bestiality to

<!-- page 145 -->

be the Essence of Humanity, Darkness 
the Center of Light, and Filthiness 
the Seat of Purity?"</p>

<p>"We could from the authority of 
the most eminent Philosophers of all 
ages, confirm this our Assertion; few 
of whom ever had the impudence to 
degrade this Queen, the Rational 
Soul, to the very lowest and vilest 
Apartment, or rather Sink of her 
whole Palace. But we shall produce 
still a greater Authority than these, 
to manifest that personal Individuality 
did subsist, when there was no 
such generative Carnality."</p>

<p>"It hath been strenuously maintained 
by many holy Divines (and particularly 
by Thomas Aquinas) that our 
first Parents, in the state of Innocence, 
did in no wise propagate their 
species after the present common 
manner of men and beasts: but that 
the propagation at that time must 
have been by Intuition, Coalition of 
Ideas, or some pure and spiritual 
manner, suitable to the dignity of 
their station. And though the Sexes

<!-- page 146 -->

were distinguished in that State, yet 
it is plain it was not by parts, such 
as we have at present; since, if our 
First Parents had any such, they 
must have known it; And it is written, 
that they discovered them not 
till after the Fall; when it is probable 
those parts were the immediate 
Excrescence of Sin, and only grew 
forth to render them fitter companions 
for those Beasts among 
which they were driven.</p>

<p>"It is a Maxim in Philosophy, that 
<i>Generatio unius est Corruptio alterius:</i> 
whence it is apparent that the Paradisaical 
Generation was of a different 
nature from ours, free from all 
Corruption and Imbecility. This 
is further corroborated by the Authority 
of those Doctors of the 
Church who have asserted, that before 
the Fall, Adam was endowed 
with a continual uninterrupted Faculty 
of Generation; which can be 
explained of no other than of that 
<i>Intuitive Generation</i> abovesaid: Since 
it is well known to all, the least

<!-- page 147 -->

skilled in Anatomy, that the present 
(male) part of Generation is utterly 
incapable of this continual Faculty.</p>

<p>"We come now to our <i>second</i> point, 
wherein the Advocate for the Plaintiff 
asserteth, that if there were two 
persons, and one Organ of Generation, 
this System would constitute but 
one Wife. This will put the Plaintiff 
still in a worse condition, and 
render him plainly guilty of Bigamy, 
Rape, or Incest. For if there be 
but one such Organ of Generation, 
then both the persons of Lindamira 
and Indamora have an equal property 
in it; and what is Indamora's 
property cannot be disposed of 
without her consent. We therefore 
bring the whole to this short issue; 
whether the Plaintiff <i>Martinus 
Scriblerus</i> had the <i>Consent</i> of Indamora, 
or <i>not?</i> If he hath <i>had</i> her 
consent, he is guilty of <i>Bigamy;</i> if 
<i>not</i>, he is guilty of a <i>Rape</i>, or <i>Incest</i>, 
or both.</p>

<p>"The Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, 
having been lately

<!-- page 148 -->

baptized, hath with singular modesty 
abstained from Consummation 
with his said Wife, until he shall be 
satisfied from the opinion of your 
Honour, his learned Judge, how 
far in Law and Conscience he may 
proceed: And therefore he cannot 
affirm much, nor positively, as to the 
structure of the Organ of Generation 
of this his wife Indamora. Yet 
make we no doubt, that it will upon 
inspection appear, that the said Organ 
is distinct from that of Lindamira: 
Whereupon we crave to hear 
the Report of the Jury of Matrons, 
appointed to inspect the body of the 
said gentlewoman.</p>

<p>"And if the Matter of Fact be thus, 
give me your Honour's permission 
to repeat what hath been said by 
the Advocate for the Plaintiff; to
wit, that <i>Martinus Scriblerus</i>, 
Bachelor in Physic, by this his 
Marriage with <i>Lindamira</i>, could, in 
no wise, acquire any property in the 
body of Indamora; not show any 
Cause why this duplicated Wife

<!-- page 149 -->

Lindamira-Indamora, should abide 
with him, rather than with the Defendant 
Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw 
of Monomotapa."</p>

<p>The Jury of Matrons having made 
their Report, and it appearing from 
thence that the Parts of Generation in 
Lindamira and Indamora were distinct; 
the Judge took time to deliberate, and 
the next Court-Day he spoke to this 
effect.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that Lindamira 
and Indamora are distinct persons, 
and that both the Marriages are 
good and valid: Therefore I order 
you Martinus Scriblerus, Bachelor 
in Physic, and you Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, 
Prince of Monomotapa, to 
cohabit with your wives, and to lie 
in bed each on the side of his own 
wife. I hope, Gentlemen, you will 
seriously consider, that you are under
a stricter Tie than common Brothers-in-law; 
that being, as it were, 
Joint Proprietors of one common

<!-- page 150 -->

Tenement, you will so behave as 
good fellow-lodgers ought to do, 
and with great modesty each to his 
respective sister-in-law, abstaining 
from all further Familiarities than 
what Conjugal Duties do naturally 
oblige you to. Consider also by 
how small limits the Duty and the 
Trespass is divided, lest, while ye discharge 
the duty of Matrimony, ye 
heedlessly slide into the sin of Adultery."</p>

<p>This Sentence pleased neither Party; 
and Martin appealed from the Consistory 
to the <i>Court</i> of <i>Arches;</i> but they 
confirmed the Sentence of the Consistory.</p>

<p>It was at last brought before a <i>Commission</i> 
of <i>Delegates;</i> who, having 
weighed the Case, reversed the Sentence 
of the inferior Courts, and disannulled 
the marriage, upon the following Reasons:
"That allowing the manner of 
Cohabitation enjoined to be practicable, 
(though highly inconvenient) 
yet the <i>Jus petendi &amp; reddendi Debitum 
conjugale</i> being at all times equal

<!-- page 151 -->

in both husbands and both wives, 
and at the same time impossible 
in more than one; Two persons 
could not have a Right to the entire 
possession of the same thing, at the 
same time; nor could one so enjoy 
his property, as to debar another from 
the use of his, who has an equal 
right. So much as to the <i>Debitum 
petendi</i>, and as to the <i>Debitum reddendi, 
nemo tenetur ad impossibile</i>."
Therefore the Lords, with great Wisdom, 
dissolved both Marriages, as proceeding 
upon a natural, as well as legal 
Absurdity.</p>

<p>CHAP. XV.</p>

<p>Of the Secession of Martinus, and some 
Hints of his Travels.</p>

</div>

<p>THIS affair being thus unhappily 
terminated, and become the 
whole Talk of the Town; Martinus, 
unable to support the Affliction, as well 
as to avoid the many disagreeable Consequences,

<!-- page 152 -->

resolved to quit the Kingdom.</p>

<p>But we must not here neglect to 
mention, that during the whole Course 
of this Process, his continual Attendance 
on the Courts in his own Cause, 
and his invincible Curiosity for all that 
passed in the Causes of others, gave him 
a wonderful insight into this Branch 
of Learning, which must be confessed to 
have been so improved by the Moderns, 
as beyond all comparison to exceed the 
Ancients. From the day his first Bill 
was filed, he began to collect <i>Reports;</i> 
and before his Suit was ended, he had 
time abundantly sufficient to compile a 
very considerable Volume. His Anger 
at his ill success caused him to destroy 
the greatest part of these <i>Reports;</i> and 
only to preserve such, as discovered most 
of the Chicanery and Futility of the 
practice. These we have some hopes 
to recover, if they were only mislaid at 
his Removal; if not, the world will be 
enough instructed to lament the loss, 
by the only one now public, viz. 
The <i>Case of</i> Stradling <i>and</i> Stiles, <i>in an

<!-- page 153 -->

Action concerning certain</i> black <i>and</i> 
white Horses.</p>

<p>We cannot wonder that he contracted 
a violent Aversion to the <i>Law</i>, as 
is evident from a whole Chapter of his 
Travels. And perhaps his Disappointment 
gave him also a Disinclination to 
the <i>Fair Sex</i>, for whom on some occasions 
he does not express all the Respect 
and Admiration possible. This 
doubtless must be the Reason, that in 
no part of his <i>Travels</i> we find him beloved 
by any <i>strange Princess;</i> nor 
have we the least account that he ever 
relapsed into this Passion, except what 
is mentioned in the Introduction, of the 
<i>Spanish Lady's Phenomenon</i>.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1699 that Martin set out on his
<i>Travels</i>. Thou wilt certainly be very curious to 
know what they were? It is not yet time to inform thee. 
But what hints I am at liberty to give, I will.</p>

<p>Thou shalt know then, that in his first Voyage he was 
carried by a prosperous Storm, to a Discovery of the

<!-- page 154 -->

Remains of the ancient <i>Pygm&aelig;an</i> Empire.</p>

<p>That in his second, he was as happily 
shipwrecked on the Land of the <i>Giants</i>, 
now the most humane people in the 
world.</p>

<p>That in his third Voyage, he discovered 
a whole Kingdom of <i>Philosophers</i>, 
who govern by the <i>Mathematics;</i> 
with whose admirable Schemes and 
Projects he returned to benefit his own 
dear Country, but had the misfortune 
to find them rejected by the envious 
Ministers of <i>Queen Anne</i>, and himself 
sent treacherously away.</p>

<p>And hence it is, that in his fourth 
Voyage he discovers a Vein of Melancholy 
proceeding almost to a Disgust of 
his Species; but above all, a mortal 
Detestation to the whole flagitious Race 
of <i>Ministers</i>, and a final Resolution 
not to give in any <i>Memorial</i> to the <i>Secretary 
of State</i>, in order to subject the 
Lands he discovered to the <i>Crown</i> of 
<i>Great Britain</i>.</p>

<p>Now if, by these hints, the Reader 
can help himself to a further discovery

<!-- page 155 -->

of the Nature and Contents of these 
Travels, he is welcome to as much light 
as they afford him; I am obliged by all 
the ties of honour not to speak more 
openly.</p>

<p>But if any man shall ever see such 
very extraordinary Voyages, into such 
very extraordinary Nations, which manifest 
the most distinguishing marks of 
a Philosopher, a Politician, and a Legislator; 
and can imagine them to belong 
to a <i>Surgeon of a Ship</i>, or a <i>Captain</i> of 
a <i>Merchant-man</i>, let him remain in his 
Ignorance.</p>

<p>And whoever he be, that shall further 
observe, in every page of such a 
book, that cordial <i>Love</i> of <i>Mankind</i>, 
that inviolable <i>Regard</i> to <i>Truth</i>, that 
<i>Passion</i> for his <i>dear Country</i>, and that 
particular attachment to the excellent 
Princess Queen <i>Anne;</i> surely that man 
deserves to be pitied, if by all those visible 
Signs and Characters, he cannot 
distinguish and acknowledge the Great 
<i>Scriblerus</i>.<span class="sup"><a href="#n16" id="r16">16</a></span></p>

<p>CHAP. XVI.</p>

<p>Of the Discoveries and Works of the 
Great Scriblerus, made and to be made, 
written and to be written, known and 
unknown.</p>

</div>

<p>AND here it seems but natural, to 
lament the unfortunate End of 
the Amour of our Philosopher. But 
the Historian of these Memoirs on the 
contrary cries out, "Happy, thrice 
happy day! which dissolved the 
Marriage of the great Scriblerus! 
let it be celebrated in every language, 
learned and unlearned! let the 
Latin, the Greek, the Arabian, the 
Coptic; let all the Tongues of many-languaged 
men, nay of Animals, be 
employed to resound it! since to this 
we owe such immense discoveries, 
not only of Oceans, Continents, Islands, 
with all their Inhabitants, 
minute, gigantic, mortal, and immortal; 
but those yet more enlarged

<!-- page 157 -->

and astonishing Views, of worlds 
philosophical, physical, moral, intelligible, 
and unintelligible!"</p>

<p>Here therefore, at this great Period, 
we end our first Book. And here, O Reader, 
we entreat thee utterly to forget 
all thou hast hitherto read, and to cast 
thy eyes only forward, to that boundless 
Field the next shall open unto thee; 
the fruits of which (if thine, or our sins 
do not prevent) are to spread and multiply 
over this our work, and over all 
the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>In the mean time, know what thou 
owest, and what thou yet mayst owe, 
to this excellent Person, this Prodigy of 
our Age; who may well be called <i>The 
Philosopher of Ultimate Causes</i>, since by 
a Sagacity peculiar to himself, he hath 
discovered Effects in their very Cause; 
and without the trivial helps of Experiments,
 or Observations, hath been the 
Inventor of most of the modern Systems 
and Hypotheses.</p>

<p>He hath enriched Mathematics 
with many precise and Geometrical 
<i>Quadratures</i> of the <i>Circle</i>. He first

<!-- page 158 -->

discovered the <i>Cause</i> of <i>Gravity</i>, 
and the intestine <i>Motion</i> of <i>Fluids</i>.</p>

<p>To him we owe all the observations 
on the <i>Parallax</i> of the <i>Pole-Star</i>, and 
all the new <i>Theories</i> of the <i>Deluge</i>.</p>

<p>He it was, that first taught the right 
use sometimes of the <i>Fuga Vacui</i>, and 
sometimes of the <i>Materia Subtilis</i>, in 
resolving the grand Phenomena of Nature.</p>

<p>He it was, that first found out the 
<i>Palpability</i> of <i>Colours;</i> and by the delicacy 
of his Touch, could distinguish 
the different Vibrations of the heterogeneous 
Rays of Light.</p>

<p>His were the Projects of <i>Perpetuum 
Mobiles</i>, <i>Flying Engines</i>, and <i>Pacing 
Saddles;</i> the Method of discovering the 
<i>Longitude</i>, by <i>Bomb-Vessels</i>, and of increasing 
the <i>Trade-Wind</i> by vast plantations 
of <i>Reeds</i> and <i>Sedges</i>.</p>

<p>I shall mention only a few of his 
Philosophical and Mathematical Works.</p>

<ol>

<li>A complete Digest of the Laws 
of Nature, with a Review of those that 
are obsolete or repealed, and of those

<!-- page 159 -->

that are ready to be renewed and put in 
force.</li>

<li>A Mechanical Explication of the 
Formation of the Universe, according 
to the Epicurean Hypothesis.</li>

<li>An Investigation of the Quantity 
of real Matter in the Universe, with the 
proportion of the specific Gravity of 
solid Matter to that of fluid.</li>

<li>Microscopical Observations of the 
Figure and Bulk of the constituent 
Parts of all fluids. A Calculation of 
the proportion in which the Fluids of 
the earth decrease, and of the period in 
which they will be totally exhausted.</li>

<li>A Computation of the Duration 
of the Sun, and how long it will last 
before it be burned out.</li>

<li>A Method to apply the Force arising 
from the immense Velocity of 
<i>Light</i> to mechanical purposes.</li>

<li>An answer to the question of a 
curious Gentleman; How long a <i>New 
Star</i> was lighted up before its appearance 
to the Inhabitants of our earth? 
To which is subjoined a Calculation, 
how much the Inhabitants of the <i>Moon</i>

<!-- page 160 -->

eat for Supper, considering that they 
pass a Night equal to fifteen of our 
natural days.</li>

<li>A Demonstration of the natural 
Dominion of the Inhabitants of the 
Earth over those of the Moon, if ever 
an intercourse should be opened between 
them. With a Proposal of a 
<i>Partition-Treaty</i>, among the earthly 
Potentates, in case of such discovery.</li>

<li>Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is 
to approximate towards the Earth.</li>

<li>The Number of the Inhabitants of 
London determined by the Reports 
of the Gold-finders, and the Tonnage 
of their Carriages; with allowance for the 
extraordinary quantity of the <i>Ingesta</i> 
and <i>Egesta</i> of the people of England, 
and a deduction of what is left under 
dead walls, and dry ditches.</li>

</ol>

<p>It will from hence be evident, how 
much all his Studies were directed to 
the universal Benefit of Mankind. 
Numerous have been his Projects to this 
end, of which <i>Two</i> alone will be sufficient 
to show the amazing Grandeur

<!-- page 161 -->

of his Genius. The first was a Proposal, 
by a general contribution of all 
Princes, to pierce the first crust or <i>Nucleus</i> 
of this our <i>Earth</i>, quite through, 
to the next concentrical Sphere: The 
advantage he proposed from it was, to 
find the <i>Parallax</i> of the <i>Fixed Stars;</i> 
but chiefly to refute Sir Isaac Newton's 
Theory of <i>Gravity</i>, and Mr. Halley's 
of the <i>Variations</i>. The second was, to 
build <i>Two Poles</i> to the <i>Meridian</i>, with 
immense Light-houses on the top of 
them; to supply the defect of Nature, 
and to make the Longitude as easy to 
be calculated as the Latitude. Both 
these he could not but think very practicable, 
by the Power of all the Potentates 
of the World.</p>

<p>May we presume after these to mention, 
how he descended from the sublime 
to the beneficial parts of Knowledge, 
and particularly his extraordinary 
practice of <i>Physic</i>. From the Age; 
Complexion, or Weight of the person 
given, he contrived to prescribe at a distance, 
as well as at a Patient's bed-side. 
He taught the way to many modern

<!-- page 162 -->

Physicians, to cure their Patients 
by <i>Intuition</i>, and to others to cure <i>without 
looking on them at all</i>. He projected 
a Menstruum to dissolve the Stone, 
made of Dr. Woodward's <i>Universal 
Deluge-water</i>. His also was the device 
to relieve Consumptive or Asthmatic 
persons by bringing fresh Air out of 
the Country to Town, by pipes of the 
nature of the Recipients of Air-pumps: 
And to introduce the Native air of a 
man's country into any other in which 
he should travel, with a seasonable Intromission 
of such Steams as were most 
familiar to him; to the inexpressible 
comfort of many Scotsmen, Laplanders, 
and white Bears.</p>

<p>In <i>Physiognomy</i>, his penetration is 
such, that from the <i>Picture</i> only of any 
person, he can write his <i>Life;</i> and 
from the features of the Parents, draw 
the Portrait of any Child that is to be 
born.</p>

<p>Nor hath he been so enrapt in these 
Studies, as to neglect the Polite Arts 
of Painting, Architecture, Music, 
Poetry, etc. It was he that gave the

<!-- page 163 -->

first hint to our modern <i>Painters</i>, to 
improve the <i>Likeness</i> of their Portraits 
by the use of such <i>Colours</i> as would 
faithfully and constantly accompany the 
<i>Life</i>, not only in its present state, but 
in all its alterations, decays, age, and 
death itself.</p>

<p>In <i>Architecture</i>, he builds not with 
so much regard to present symmetry or 
conveniency, as with a Thought well 
worthy a true lover of Antiquity, to 
wit, the noble effect the Building will 
have to posterity, when it shall fall and 
become a Ruin.</p>

<p>As to <i>Music</i>, I think Heidegger has 
not the face to deny that he has been 
much beholden to his Scores.</p>

<p>In <i>Poetry</i>, he hath appeared under a 
hundred different names, of which we 
may one day give a Catalogue.</p>

<p>In <i>Politics</i>, his Writings are of a 
peculiar Cast, for the most part Ironical, 
and the Drift of them often so 
delicate and refined as to be mistaken 
by the vulgar. He once went so far 
as to write a Persuasive to people to 
eat their own Children, which was so

<!-- page 164 -->

little understood as to be taken in ill 
part.<span class="sup"><a href="#n17" id="r17">17</a></span> He has often written against 
<i>Liberty</i> in the name of <i>Freemen</i> and 
<i>Algernon Sydney</i>, in vindication of the 
Measures of <i>Spain</i> under that of <i>Raleigh</i>, 
and in praise of <i>Corruption</i> under 
those of <i>Cato</i>, and <i>Publicola</i>.</p>

<p>It is true, that at his last departure 
from England, in the Reign of Queen 
<i>Anne</i>, apprehending lest any of these
 might be perverted to the Scandal of 
the weak, or Encouragement of the 
flagitious, he cast them all, without 
mercy, into a Bog-house near <i>St. 
James's</i>. Some however have been 
with great diligence recovered, and 
fished up with a hook and line by the 
Ministerial Writers, which make at 
present the great Ornaments of their 
works.</p>

<p>Whatever he judged beneficial to 
Mankind, he constantly communicated 
(not only during his stay among us, 
but ever since his absence) by some 
method or other in which Ostentation 
had no part. With what incredible 
Modesty he concealed himself, is known

to numbers of those to whom he addressed 
sometimes Epistles, sometimes 
Hints, sometimes whole Treatises, Advices 
to Friends, Projects to First Ministers, 
Letters to Members of Parliament, 
Accounts to the Royal Society, 
and innumerable others.</p>

<p>All these will be vindicated to the 
true Author, in the Course of these 
Memoirs. I may venture to say they 
cannot be unacceptable to any, but to 
those, who will appear too much concerned 
as <i>Plagiaries</i>, to be admitted as 
<i>Judges</i>. Wherefore we warn the public, 
to take particular notice of all 
such as manifest any indecent Passion 
at the appearance of this Work, as Persons 
most certainly involved in the 
Guilt.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>[From the 1778 Edition of the <i>Works of Alexander Pope</i>]</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r01" id="n01">1</a></span>This marks the time when the Introduction was written.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r02" id="n02">2</a></span>Mr. Pope, Dr. Arbuthnot, and Dr. Swift projected to write a satire,
in conjunction, <i>on the abuses of human learning;</i> and to make it the better received, 
they proposed to do it in the manner of Cervantes (the original author 
of this species of satire) under the history of some feigned adventures.
They had observed those <i>abuses</i> still kept their ground against all that the
ablest and gravest Authors could say to discredit them; they concluded therefore, 
the force of ridicule was wanting to quicken their disgrace; which was
here in its place, when the abuses had been already detected by sober reasoning; 
and <i>Truth</i> in no danger to suffer by the <i>premature</i> use of so powerful an
instrument. But the separation of our Author's friends, which soon after
happened, with the death of one, and the infirmities of the other, put a final 
stop to their project, when they had only drawn out an imperfect essay towards 
it, under the title of the <i>First book of the Memoirs of Scriblerus</i>.</p>

<p>Polite letters never lost more than in the defeat of this scheme, in which,
each of this illustrious triumvirate would have found exercise for his own peculiar 
talent; besides constant employment for that they all had in common.
Dr. Arbuthnot was skilled in every thing which related to <i>science;</i> Mr. Pope
was a master in the <i>fine arts;</i> and Dr. Swift excelled in the <i>knowledge of the
world</i>. <span class="smcap">Wit</span> they had all in equal measure, and this so large, that no age
perhaps ever produced three men, to whom <i>Nature</i> had more bountifully bestowed 
it, or <i>Art</i> brought it to higher perfection.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r03" id="n03">3</a></span>There was a great deal of trifling pedantry and curiosity in that great
Man's character.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r04" id="n04">4</a></span>It was with judgment that the Authors chose rather
to ridicule the modern relator of this ridiculous practice, than the Ancients
from whence he took it. As it is a sure instance of folly, when amongst the
many excellent things which may be learned from Antiquity, we find a modern 
writer only picking out their absurdities.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r05" id="n05">5</a></span>See the Dissertation on Dr. Woodward's Shield.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r06" id="n06">6</a></span>Poor Vadius, long with learned spleen devour'd,<br/>
Can taste no pleasure since his Shield was scour'd.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r07" id="n07">7</a></span>There are some extravagant lies told
of the excellent Pascal's amazing genius for Mathematics in his early youth;
and some trifling directions given for the introduction to the elements of
Science, in Mr. Locke's book of Education.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r08" id="n08">8</a></span>Who was taught Latin in his nurse's arms, and not suffered to hear a
Word of his mother-tongue, till he could speak the other perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r09" id="n09">9</a></span>So Montaigne says of his Latin. George Bucanan et Mark Antoine
Muret, mes precepteurs domestiques, m'ont dit souvent que j'avois ce language
en mon enfance si prest et si &agrave; main qu'ils craignoient a m'accoster.&mdash;Somme, 
nous nous latinizames tant, qu'il en regorgea jusqu' &agrave; nos villages
tout autour, ou il y a encores, et ont pris pied par l'usage, plusieurs appellations 
Latines d'Artisans et d'outils.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r10" id="n10">10</a></span>Dr. Arbuthnot used to say, that notwithstanding all the boasts of the
safe conveyance of <i>Tradition</i>, it was nowhere preserved pure and uncorrupt
but amongst Children; whose Games and Plays are delivered down invariably 
from one generation to another.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r11" id="n11">11</a></span>When a learned Friend once urged to our Author the Authority of a
famous Dictionary-maker against the Latinity of the expression <i>amor publicas</i>, 
which he had used in an inscription, he replied, that he would allow a
Dictionary-maker to understand a single word, but not two words put together.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r12" id="n12">12</a></span>"But if it be possible for the same man to have distinct incommunicable
consciousness at different times, it is without doubt the same man would,
at different times, make different persons. Which we see is the sense of
mankind in not punishing the madman for the sober man's actions, nor
the sober man for what the madman did, thereby making them two persons; 
which is somewhat explained by our way of speaking in <i>English</i>,
when they say such an one <i>is not himself</i>, or <i>is beside himself</i>." <i>Lock's Essay
on Hum. Underst.</i> B. ii. c. 27.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r13" id="n13">13</a></span>This is not a fair representation of what is said in the <i>Essay of Hum. Underst.</i> 
concerning <i>general and abstract ideas</i>. But serious writers have done
that Philosopher the same injustice.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r14" id="n14">14</a></span><i>Μασσητήρες μῦες</i></p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r15" id="n15">15</a></span>This whole Chapter is an inimitable ridicule on <i>Collins's</i> arguments against 
<i>Clarke</i>, to prove the Soul only a quality.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r16" id="n16">16</a></span><i>Gulliver's Travels</i> were first intended as a part of Scriblerus's Memoirs.</p>

<p><span class="sup"><a href="#r17" id="n17">17</a></span>Swift's ironical tract on that subject.</p>
