<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>KIND READER,&mdash;My characters are not such
as are usually found in books; but they are
none the less real,&mdash;are, indeed, more real
than are any of those in my previous works. "Eben
Rockman" is a friend of other years, though bearing
a different name; still there are those who, if they
read this book, can not fail to recognize who is intended.
He was, as is stated, once a Methodist
minister, but before his death was up to the most
radical questions of this hour; and we have portrayed
him as he would naturally have been under
similar circumstances.</p>

<p>In "Minnie Morris" we have combined two living
characters, making her greater than one and less
than the other; and there are many facts connected
with what I ascribe to her, enough to warrant me in
saying that the character is not overdrawn.</p>

<p>In the one spoken of as "I," we have a living
counterpart; a progressive mind with large caution

<!-- page 6 -->

and small self-esteem, in which an educated conscience
struggles with, but can not set aside, the
truths that press themselves upon the understanding.</p>

<p>Robert Crandall is no uncommon character, and
just such a one as our present order of society would
naturally produce under some combinations of circumstances.</p>

<p>That we have portrayed, have fairly delineated,
some of the causes that produce the unequal conditions
of society, making ignorance and degradation
prevalent, we are quite certain; and whenever we
hear the prayer, "Thy kingdom come, and thy will
be done on earth as it is in heaven," we tremble
before the import of the words uttered; for we
know that there must come such a change, such an
overturning, ere such a prayer can be answered,
that the mighty ones of earth may well call upon
the rocks and mountains to hide them.</p>

<p>But, no matter how new the thoughts advanced
may be to you, we hope, dear reader, that you will
not on that account set them aside, but will candidly
weigh their import, taking them for what they are
worth to you. And may the God of truth lead you
into all truth!</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">A QUEER CHARACTER.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"Mankind should be like rivers free:<br/>

The less they are damned, the better."</p>

<p>"SERPENTS, generation of vipers! how
can ye escape the damnation of hell?"
I was threading my way through the
back streets of a Christian city, and
wondering the while that, within sight
of so many steeples, there should be so much misery,
so much degradation, when the above words fell
upon my ear with so startling an emphasis that, in
spite of my hurry, I paused to see who had spoken
them.</p>

<p>Turning in the direction of the sound, I found
that I was not alone in my curiosity; for quite a
group had gathered around a tall, singular-looking
man, who stood with his head thrown back, his right
arm extended, his chest heaving with emotion, and
his eye flashing with a fire that seemed volcanic in
its intensity.</p>

<!-- page 10 -->

<p>"Eb is raving again," said a well-dressed but sensual-looking
man standing near me.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! a half-crazy fellow who believes that society
is all wrong. Rockman they call him,&mdash;Eben Rockman.
I do not see what he is allowed to run loose
for. But I suppose he is harmless."</p>

<p>The last words caught the ear of the one of whom
they were spoken, and a look passed over his face
which I have no power to analyze,&mdash;such a mixture
of severity, pity, and contempt, all in one; the
object of which cowered and shrank within himself
as though from a flash of coming doom. This but a
moment, however, and then he burst into a loud
laugh with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, Eb, don't annihilate a fellow."</p>

<p>"A fellow, are you? I am glad of it; something
less than a <i>man</i>, of course; a sheep-thief, people
used to call such when I was a boy."</p>

<p>Rockman paused till the laugh that this retort
had produced died away, and then continued, "No,
I would not annihilate a <i>fellow</i>; it would be too
small a business: but, had I the power, I would kick
this damned system of society to the hell in which it
belongs, and to which it is going too, as fast as time
can carry it."</p>

<p>"What has roused you so now, Mr. Rockman?"
asked a clerical-looking gentlemen who had just
come upon the scene.</p>

<p>"I suppose, parson, that you would say it was the
devil, the natural depravity within me; but, if I
should hold my peace, the very stones would cry out

<!-- page 11 -->

against the self-righteous injustice of this Pharisaical
world."</p>

<p>"It is necessary that we be charitable to all,"
replied the parson.</p>

<p>"Charitable? yes, even at the expense of justice.
Look there."</p>

<p>I looked in the direction indicated by his finger,
and saw a woman of perhaps thirty years of age
issuing from the office of a petty justice, police-court,
or something of the kind,&mdash;a place where men sit in
judgment on woman; where they condemn her for
breaking laws that she had no voice in making, and
no control of the circumstances which pressed her
into the breaking.</p>

<p>This woman was fair to look upon, notwithstanding
the despairing expression upon her features;
handsome she had been, was yet. There was something
of her native dignity left, for the jeer of the
crowd was hushed into silence ere it rose to the lip,
and all seemed to feel the splendor, the majesty even,
of the ruin that had been wrought, and so shrank
back, and allowed her to be led away by the burly
policeman without sending an insult after her.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Small sighed and turned away.
The well-dressed man who had called himself a
"fellow" asked, "What's the crime?" and Rockman
replied, "Love's sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Love's sacrifice?" I repeated inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; do you not know that it is a sin to love?
People can hate each other with impunity; but
when, like an innocent child, a woman loves and
trusts a man, then she is accursed, trodden under
foot."</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>"Please explain yourself," said I, for there was
something in this singular man that interested me.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to explain, madam; only she
loved a man, or a being called by that name, and
this is her requital. She bore him three children, or,
rather, she bore the State three children; for as soon
as they are old enough the State will take them, if it
needs them, and send them off to be shot at. But
the man she loved has forsaken her; and the State
that makes laws for her without her consent refuses
to provide for her while she is doing its work, and
so she took what they and she needed; and this is
the result."</p>

<p>"But where is her husband?"</p>

<p>"She has no husband that the law recognizes."</p>

<p>"No husband! What right has she with children,
then?"</p>

<p>"The right that God Almighty gave her, madam,&mdash;the
right in virtue of her being a woman."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The law had not said she might. I know it had
not; but had the law any right in the matter?"</p>

<p>"We should be in a state of anarchy, if there were
no laws to regulate society," I found tongue to say
at length, in spite of the piercing eye that Rockman
fixed upon me.</p>

<p>"Oh! come away, sister, and leave that crazy man
to himself," said a voice near me.</p>

<p>"Yes: go, madam, and don't waste your time and
strength on me," said Rockman; "go, and think out
this question: Has the law, has God or man, the right
to deprive us of the natural use of any organ of the
body or brain?"</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>And then, turning, he walked away, repeating
loud enough for all to hear, "God damn this thievish,
Christian nation!"</p>

<p>I went to my bed that night earlier than usual,
but could not sleep. My soul was full of questionings;
and the voice of the singular being that I had
met kept ringing in my ear, like the veritable curse
of the Almighty. His closing words would have
seemed the rankest profanity from any other lips;
but as I remembered his tall form, his white hair,
clear eye, and erect carriage, I could almost fancy
that one of the ancient prophets had returned to
earth to rebuke its sin.</p>

<p>And yet what strange ideas he had advocated? A
woman a right to be a mother, and not a wife?
Horrible! could I think of such a fate for my darling
sister just budding into womanhood? And yet
it might be hers; but woe to the man who would
dare to wrong her! I would take his heart's blood.
And then my mind went back to the woman I had
seen led away a prisoner. Where was the father of
her children? Who was he? Where were the children?</p>

<p>It was useless. I could not sleep: so I arose,
bathed my face, dressed, and sat by the window till
daylight broke. The first sound that I heard in the
morning was that of an early workman in the adjoining
lot, on which a house was being built. Presently
he began to sing in an undertone, raising his
voice a little as he entered into the spirit of the
piece; and I caught the words,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p class="small">"Woe to the man whose wealth proclaims<br/>

Another man's undoing;<br/>

Whose palace walls so proudly rise<br/>

On interest, rent, and ruin!"</p>

<p>"Hallo there, John! you seem to be merry this
morning. But where did you get those words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'On interest, rent, and ruin'?"</p>

</div>

<p>"I do not know, Mr. Wellby. I have heard them
somewhere, I presume, and repeated them without
thinking."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are not one of the discontented
sort, John; for I should dismiss you if you were. I
want none of your moping people about me. Why,
where do you suppose I get the money to build this
house?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do not know, sir."</p>

<p>"Didn't care, so that you got the pay for your
work, eh? Well, I guess you would be bad off if
we moneyed men did not furnish you work. And it
saves you the trouble of thinking too. All you have
to do is to do your work, and take your pay for it."</p>

<p>"We ought to be very much obliged to you, Mr.
Wellby, and very thankful for our lot, I presume,"
was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Come, now, don't be sarcastic, John, for I was
just going to tell you where the money came from
to build this house; and, as work is not very brisk
this season, perhaps you would have gone hungry
if I had not been able to build it."</p>

<p>"Please go on: I am listening."</p>

<p>"Yes: well, I suppose you know that twelve years

<!-- page 15 -->

ago city lots were not as high here in this part of
the city as they are now; and, more than that, there
was a bankrupt sale of some half-dozen or more; and,
having a little ready money, I got them for a mere
trifle."</p>

<p>"Less than their real worth, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but business is business, you know, John,
and they had to be sold."</p>

<p>"True: a bankrupt sale, I think you said?"</p>

<p>"I did, and a pretty mess they made of it; got in
debt to everybody, and then could not pay fifty cents
on a dollar. Downright dishonesty I call that."</p>

<p>John looked up, as if he would speak, then, closing
his lips firmly, looked down again, and went on
with his work; but there was a sort of tremor, a nervousness
in his movements, that had not been evident
before.</p>

<p>I was becoming interested, and listened for the
next word, fearing that I should lose it, or that some
other portion of the conversation would escape me.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, after a moment's silence,
"people have no business to go so beyond their
means. But, as those lots were to be sold, I might as
well have them as any one else; so I bought them,
and in two years' time sold two of them for twice as
much as I paid for the whole six. That money I
sent West, for I could get a better rate of interest
there than here. Twelve per cent I realized, getting
my pay once in six months, one hundred and twenty
dollars on two thousand, twice a year. I then borrowed
three thousand here at seven per cent, and
put up a house on one of the lots. Business grew

<!-- page 16 -->

brisk, rents went up; and in two years from the time
it was completed I received four hundred dollars
rent-money; over and above interest on the three
thousand, and taxes on the whole purchase, or what
there was left,&mdash;the four lots and the improvements.</p>

<p>"This, with the two hundred and forty from the
West, was the commencement of the second house; I
managing to support my family, wife and one child,
on what I could earn outside this business. In eight
years from the time I made the purchase, I had the
second house built and paid for without any additional
debt. Two years more, and I had the third
one built; and in the last two years I have paid up
the three thousand, and have enough left to build
another house.</p>

<p>"So much for interest and rents, and no robbery
nor ruin about it. Those who have hired my houses
have been glad to get them to do business in, and
have made money out of it too; and the man who
hired my money was glad to get that. I have given
employment to many a poor man who did not know
where else to go; and, taken as a whole, I feel that I
have blessed the world, instead of cursing it."</p>

<p>"And blessed yourself too, Mr. Wellby."</p>

<p>"Yes; for to-day I would not take fifty thousand
dollars for what I paid one thousand for twelve years
ago."</p>

<p>"For the lots?"</p>

<p>"For the four lots and the improvements; it has
all come from the six and my management."</p>

<p>"Has the same man held the money that you sent
West, all these years?"</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>"Yes; or, rather, his widow has for the last two
years. But, had I not taken pains to have had it well
secured, I should lose it now; for, since the man's
death, things have gone badly with them, and there
are other debts. He would have worked out of his
embarrassments, had he lived. I was there just
before he died, and talked over his plans with him;
but now I do not know how it will be. But I am
secure, at all events; for the farm and buildings at
forced sale and half price will bring twice that sum;
and, as I have the first mortgage, no one else can
get any thing till my claim is satisfied."</p>

<p>"So your one thousand twelve years ago has become
fifty thousand here, and the two thousand there
beside. Mr. Wellby, you seem to be a fortunate
man; but I do not think I would change places with
you."</p>

<p>"You are a sensible man, John Brown, and you
may well say that; for no one knows the care and
perplexity that property is, but those to whom it is
intrusted; and, as the Lord's stewards, we have no
right to set it aside."</p>

<p>"Woe unto you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites,"
rang out upon the morning air; and I turned to see
my friend of the day before rapidly approaching.
He paused beside of employer and employed, looked
at each a moment, and then to Brown, " 'Thou art
faithful over a few things, and shall yet be ruler over
many;' " and to Wellby, " 'Woe unto those who devour
widows' houses, and for a pretense make long
prayers;' the Lord's stewards indeed;" and, passing
on with rapid strides, was soon lost to sight.</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>Wellby and Brown looked at each other in astonishment,
while the latter after a moment asked,
"How did he know what you were saying? he certainly
was not near enough to hear."</p>

<p>"I do not know," was the reply, "unless the Devil
helps his own; for surely, if ever any one was possessed
of the Devil, it is old Rockman."</p>

<p>"He seems quite familiar with Scripture," said
Brown.</p>

<p>"Yes; as much so as was his master when he took
Jesus to the pinnacle of the temple."</p>

<p>"He is harmless, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, only so far as his tongue goes; and, if I had
the control of him, he would use that less. But I
must go, or I shall lose the boat. Good-morning,
John: I shall trust you to see that all goes right till
my return." And the man of money passed quickly
down the street toward the landing, while John resumed
his singing. This time his refrain was,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Whose money comes from usury,<br/>

And brings another's ruin."</p>

<p>I was sitting close to the window that looked out
over the new wall that was going up; and the sounds
floated up to me on the still morning air as distinctly
as though uttered in my room. But the blind was
partly closed, so the speakers had not seen me, and
doubtless never once suspected that they had a
listener; but their words were not soon forgotten.
Indeed, the fact that I am now penning them down,
shows that they are not likely to be forgotten. But
the sound of the breakfast-bell aroused me from the

<!-- page 19 -->

train of thought into which I had fallen; and for the
time it was dropped.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, as I sat by the open
window fronting the street, Eben Rockman again
made his appearance; he saw me, bowed, crossed
over, and rang the bell. My sister went to the door.</p>

<p>"Say to the lady I would like to see her a few
moments."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary, show the gentleman this way," I
said; for I had heard what he asked.</p>

<p>"May the blessing of the Lord rest upon his handmaiden!"
he said, bowing low as he entered. "I ask
no pardon for this intrusion," he continued; "for I
feel that thou art chosen to a work in the vineyard,
that thou wilt willingly do, when thou seest the
path plain before thee. This is a wicked and perverse
generation; but woman shall yet be clothed
with the sun of power, and the moon shall be under
her feet."</p>

<p>I looked at my strange visitor in silence, for I
knew not what to reply. Just then the refrain of
the song of the workman in the adjoining lot came
plainly, and to me it seemed plaintively, to my ear,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Whose palace walls are proudly built<br/>

From usury that bringeth ruin."</p>

<p>Rockman listened, as if to hear more; but whatever
came next was lost in the noise of the hammer.
"Poor soul! there is a tale to that undertone, if we
could only learn what it is," was the next comment.</p>

<p>This opened the way for me to speak; and I told
him what I had heard Wellby say the day before.</p>

<!-- page 20 -->

<p>"Two thousand dollars for ten years, at twelve per
cent interest, twenty-four hundred dollars,&mdash;four
hundred more than the original sum," said Rockman
as if to himself; and then turning to me, he asked,
"And, if this steward of the Lord had paid twelve
per cent on each six months' interest that has been
paid back to him, how much do you suppose,
madam, the amount would have been?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," I replied, "but nearly as much
as the original sum, I should think."</p>

<p>"True; but, instead of paying twelve per cent, he
has made it bring him more than that, so the matter
stands thus: For the use of two thousand dollars ten
years, he has received two thousand four hundred
dollars direct, and usury on that sum, through the
tricks of trade, at even a higher than twelve per
cent, for the time varying from nine years and six
months, down to six months.</p>

<p>"But the interest on two thousand two hundred
and ninety dollars for six months, at twelve per cent,
is one hundred forty-five dollars, eighty cents."</p>

<p>"Where do you get that sum for six months?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It is the amount from the two thousand at twelve
per cent for nine years and six months; and Wellby
has had the use of these sums, as they have been
paid from time to time, and, from his own statement,
has made them turn to what he calls good account."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see now," I replied after a moment's
thought; and Rockman continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the end of the first six months, he received
one hundred and twenty dollars; we have counted

<!-- page 21 -->

the interest on that for one six months in our last
statement; that would give, in nine years, one hundred
twenty-nine dollars, and over. But I will not go
on bothering you with figures: you can work it out
for yourself. According to his own statement, however,
Wellby has made that two thousand pay him
more than twice the amount; and now he talks of
securing the original sum. Outrageous! damnable!</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it sounds rough," he said as if in
reply to my thought; "but not half so rough as it
will be on that poor widow when her home is sold as
a sacrifice to, and she left penniless by, the wolves
of usury."</p>

<p>"I did not reprove you, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"Your lips did not, madam, but your eyes did.
No, you need not regret it: it is no more than is
to be expected from the way we have been educated.
Avoid rough things, seek smooth things, be delicate,
tender, refined; better slide down to hell on a
polished surface, than to climb into heaven over
thorns and briers. 'Prophesy smooth things unto
us;' that is the language of the people; but woe
unto them that sew pillows to all armholes, that cry,
'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace!"</p>

<p>"You seem familiar with Scripture," I said.</p>

<p>"I am, madam, and I ought to be: I was a Methodist
minister for twenty years, and the power of the
Lord went with me. I have had sinners lying in
heaps all about me, crying, agonizing for mercy.
The groan of anguish that told of soul travail, the
shout of the new born&mdash;well, well, I see, I feel, I
am in the spirit of it now; but it is past, it is past;

<!-- page 22 -->

the glory has departed, Ichabod is written upon all
the borders of that people; I am alone, alone."
Here his voice fell to a low, wailing pathos, ending in
a gush of tears.</p>

<p>He had remained standing, merely bowing as I
requested him to be seated; but now he sank into the
nearest chair, and sat some minutes, as if lost in
thought.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, at length, rising slowly to
his feet, "but even Jesus wept over Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Then clasping his hands, in attitude of supplication,
with eyes upraised, and head thrown back, he
exclaimed, "Oh, my country, my country! Father,
if it be possible, let the bitter cup pass from it;" and
then with a "Good-morning, madam," he left the
house, and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>His manner was so earnest, and the transition so
quick, so entire from the tone of anguished entreaty
to that of common politeness, that I was completely
puzzled, and could come to no decision whatever
concerning him. Was he crazy? If so, there was
method in his madness. But the cares and duties of
the next few days drove all thought of him from my
mind; and it was months before I met him again.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">LOVE AND LAW.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"Love divine, all loves excelling,<br/>

Fix in me thy humble home."</p>

<p>"LOVE is the fulfilling of the law." These
were the words that the Rev. Arthur
Berrian took for his text one sabbath
morning, some three months after the
occurrence related in the last chapter.</p>

<p>I had not met Mr. Rockman since; but somehow,
as these words were read from the desk, the thought
of him came to my mind, and I involuntarily looked
around as if expecting to see him. Nor was I mistaken:
there he sat, three or four slips in front, and
just far enough to the right, so that, by turning
a little sideways, he could look me in the face.</p>

<p>He was doing so when I looked up; perhaps it
was the magnetism of his eyes that drew mine that
way. I was surprised, and a little annoyed, at the
fixedness of his gaze. Its expression was that of
questioning, as though he was trying to read something,
to solve some problem. After a few moments
a conclusion seemed to have been reached; and then
he dropped his eyes, leaned forward till his head
rested on the slip in front of him, and never once
looked up again during service.</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>But the sermon was spoiled for me. I could not
listen to it. I do not know why, nor whither my
mind wandered; but I seemed in a sort of dream,
and this continued till far into the night. True, I did
whatever the occasion required, arose when the congregation
arose, spoke to my friends when service
was over; but it was like a dream in a dream, and
all done mechanically.</p>

<p>About a week afterward Rockman called again.
"Well, madam, what do you think of love's being
the fulfilling of the law?" was his first salutation.</p>

<p>I looked at him, but made no reply. I could not
think why he should ask such a question.</p>

<p>"Do you not remember the text of last sabbath?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, and that was all I could think to
say.</p>

<p>"You heard the text, but not the sermon," he continued,
smiling.</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By your looks and manner."</p>

<p>"By my looks and manner! you did not once
look at me during the sermon!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; yet I saw you, and saw, too, that
you will one day hold this sin-cursed people to the
logic of their own teachings."</p>

<p>"The logic of their own teachings?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;that 'love is the fulfilling of the law.' "</p>

<p>"Who and what are you?" I asked in astonishment;
for his manner awed me.</p>

<p>"The Devil, some say; those who, were He here,
would call the master of the house Beelzebub."</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>"But who do you say that you are?"</p>

<p>"Eben Rockman, a man who has been in a trance
with his eyes open; and 'man can not hide what
Heaven would reveal:' so says the poet, and so
say I. But never mind what I am, or what I predict;
you remember what I said to you when we first
met, that woman has a right to become a mother in
virtue of her womanhood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, put that with the Bible declaration, 'Love
is the fulfilling of the law.' But first let me ask,
what law is referred to, human or divine?"</p>

<p>"Divine law, of course."</p>

<p>"When the divine law is fulfilled, has the human
a right to step in, and exact something more?"</p>

<p>"It would seem not," I replied hesitatingly; for I
did not see the full bearing of his questioning, though
I had a glimpse of it.</p>

<p>"Well, I will change the form of the question a
little: have Christians a right to exact more?"</p>

<p>"I can not see that they have, Mr. Rockman."</p>

<p>"Don't put a handle to my name, madam. Once
I needed the Mr. and the Rev., but I have
grown big enough to do without either. I am simply
Eben, the son of Sarah and John. I would not
allow the Rockman, only for the convenience of the
people; I do not need it. Reid, Sarah Reid, was my
mother's name; and I have as good a right to be Eben
Reid as Eben Rockman,&mdash;should, only my mother
was a slave, and my father her master."</p>

<p>"Your mother a slave! you have no colored blood
in your veins?"</p>

<!-- page 26 -->

<p>"None, only red; and that, I believe, is the prevailing
color of healthy blood; if you mean African
blood, no; but there are other slaves than those of
African descent."</p>

<p>"I have never seen any," I said.</p>

<p>"Is not 'love the fulfilling of the law,' madam?
and, if so, any additional bond enslaves."</p>

<p>"But you would not have us do without law?"</p>

<p>"I would have law fulfilled; love alone can do
this. Legal enactments cannot fulfill: they make
void the divine law, if they have any effect whatever.
When in accordance with love, they are a
useless addition; and, when contrary to, they supersede,
or, as I have said, make void."</p>

<p>I must have looked the perplexity I felt; for he
regarded me a moment with a sort of paternal manner,
and then said, "Do not try to solve the problem
now, but watch and wait; it will all come clear
in time. 'Here a little, and there a little.' When
will the people reach the stature of men and women
in Christ Jesus?"</p>

<p>"But I do not believe in Christ Jesus in the
sense that the church teaches," I said.</p>

<p>"You need not believe in him at all, unless you
choose; believe in yourself, and you will find your
Christ soon enough."</p>

<p>"My Christ?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for 'love is the fulfilling of the law.'
Christ came to fulfill the law; and those who love
have found their Christ.</p>

<p>"But I will mystify you no more now; think of
what I have said, and watch and pray; and may the
God of Eben bless thee! Fare thee well."</p>

<!-- page 27 -->

<p>This last visit of Rockman had a most singular
effect upon me, and I resolved that I would not see
him again. I had read of mesmerism, and witnessed
some experiments in that direction; and, having never
felt such an effect from any one else, I came to the
conclusion that it was psychology, or mesmerism,
and, as such, to be avoided.</p>

<p>So I told each member of the family separately, in
order to impress it upon their minds in a way that
they could not forget it, that they were not to let
him in if he called; deciding for myself to keep out
of his sight if possible, and, if accidentally meeting
him, to ignore him, and get away from his vicinity.
This done, I resolutely set myself to the duties
devolving upon me, determined to drive even the
thought of him away.</p>

<p>But this was not so readily done: he had opened
a floodgate, and it was not easily closed. I saw more
reason in his remarks, more truth in his suggestions,
in his questionings, than I was willing to admit.</p>

<p>I feared to be convinced of what was being urged
upon me by observation, and the pertinacity of my
own reasoning. I could not, I would not, have it
proved to me that the profession and practice of even
good people were entirely at variance; in a word,
that it was utterly impossible, under the present
order of society, to obey even the plainest teachings
of Scripture.</p>

<p>Finally, I settled down to the conclusion, that all
that was required of us was to do the best we could
under the circumstances; that God was not unjust;
that he would demand of us only what we were able

<!-- page 28 -->

to perform. I say I settled down to this conclusion,
and so I did. But I could not rest upon it; for I found
that to be relieved of the fear of God's displeasure
was not enough; I wanted the blessing of being able
to bless others; I wanted the power to DO, to remove
the causes of the evils that everywhere prevailed.
Was I presuming? Was I trying to take God's
work out of his hands? At last, however, I succeeded
in smothering the voice of my own heart, in
a measure at least.</p>

<p>"It is of no use," I said; "I can do nothing."
So I determined to ignore the evils that I could not
cure; but Eben Rockman was my fate, my Nemesis,
would not let me sleep. I had, as I supposed, nearly
gained the point of indifference which I sought, when
the voice of that disturber of my peace fell upon my
ear with the following startling words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pay the price of your ignorance till you learn
that the cause is not beyond your reach. Talk of the
altar of sacrifice! Talk of fires extinguished, of the
sacrifice being made once for all in the person of
Jesus! The altar is yet standing; it is piled high
even at this hour, and the flame is consuming that
which is laid thereon. And still they come; heaps
upon heaps slain by the Samson of human prejudice,
of human power; by the jawbone, not of dead, but
of living stupidity."</p>

<p>By this time he had passed beyond hearing; or, at
least, I could no longer understand what he was
saying, though I still caught the sound of his voice
as it floated out upon the air.</p>

<p>I wonder, even yet, how I retained so clearly what

<!-- page 29 -->

I did hear; not a word lost, but all as distinct as if
written upon my brain with a pen of fire; but the
sentence that impressed me most of all was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pay the price of your ignorance till you learn
that the cause is not beyond your reach."</p>

<p>These words came to me with a power of conviction
that I could not rid myself of. Not beyond our
reach? not beyond our reach? Surely, causes belong
to God, and not to us. So I reasoned, but
so I could not feel with those words ringing in my
ears as they came from Eben Rockman's lips that
morning; and, since then, I have searched for causes
with a ceaseless searching.</p>

<p>It must have been at least a year before I met this
strange man again, and then under circumstances
that I shall never forget till my dying day. I was
passing along the outskirts of the city in search of
the residence of an old schoolmate who had lately
moved into the vicinity. I had her street and number,
but, not being familiar with the neighborhood,
did not know exactly where to look. I was upon
the point of inquiring, when a crowd just ahead of
me attracted my attention.</p>

<p>I moved quickly forward to learn what it meant;
when a woman started up, and attempted to move
forward, but reeled, and caught the lamp-post for
support.</p>

<p>"Are you sick, or drunk?" asked one of the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Both," she fairly shrieked; "sick of this false
world, and drunk with despair."</p>

<p>Great heaven! yes, it was&mdash;it was my little

<!-- page 30 -->

Rose, the pet of my schoolroom ten years before, my
darling, blue-eyed gazelle that I had loved almost as
if she were my own child.</p>

<p>I sprang to her side. "Who has done this?" I
exclaimed, in an agony of grief.</p>

<p>Rose looked up, recognized me, and fainted. I
caught her in my arms, and rained tears over her
upturned face.</p>

<p>"Let me have her," said a voice as tender as a
woman's; and Eben Rockman took her from me, took
her in his strong arms, and, bearing her through the
crowd, turned into a house near by, and laid her
upon the sofa in the parlor, the door of which was
standing open.</p>

<p>I followed him; and, as soon as he had deposited
his unconscious burden, he turned to me with, "I
am at home here: it is all right."</p>

<p>"Why, uncle, whom have you here?" said a
pleasant-looking woman coming in from the back
way."

<p>"One who has fallen among thieves, and been
stripped of all." And then straightening himself to
his full height, with his eyes flashing like coals of
fire glowing to the white heat, and his right arm
extended, he exclaimed, "Serpents, generation of
vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</p>

<p>"Ye priests, ye Pharisees, ye preach from your
pulpits that love is the fulfilling of the law; and this
is the reward that one gets for loving."</p>

<p>"Where am I?" said the poor girl, as she opened
her eyes, and looked around with a bewildered air.</p>

<p>"Where the angels of God are watching over you,
my poor lamb."</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>"Rose, my sweet darling," I said, laying my hand
caressingly upon her fair head.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rockman, and my teacher that I have not
seen for so long: what does it mean?" Then, as if
something had come back to her that she had for a
moment forgotten, she uttered a quick, gasping,
"Oh!" followed by such a despairing cry as I never
wish to listen to again.</p>

<p>Rockman's frame shook with the intensity of his
emotions. "I must say it, or die," said he; and then
he burst forth with the words I had heard him utter
once before, "God damn this thievish, Christian
nation."</p>

<p>"Don't, Mr. Rockman! don't call on God to curse
anybody: forgive them as I do," said Rose, who
seemed calmed and steadied through the intensity of
his emotion.</p>

<p>"It is well for you to say that, little one; but you
could not have done it, had I not scattered the force
of your agony by that very curse. I can stand it,
and you can not; I have been a sort of lightning-rod
to carry off the surplus charge."</p>

<p>This reply surprised me exceedingly; and I must
have looked what I felt, for he said, as if in response,
"Never mind, madam; I will explain that to
you another time."</p>

<p>"I think I understand it," said Rose, "though I
never thought of it before."</p>

<p>"Can you explain it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, but I can feel it. Still," she added, after a
moment's pause, "I can not say that I am glad of
the relief, for it only prolongs the torture; and, the

<!-- page 32 -->

sooner it is over, the better. I have lived too long
now."</p>

<p>"No, no, you must not die," said Rockman: "you
must live, live to help find out and destroy the
causes which lead to such results."</p>

<p>"The cause is plain enough," she answered. "It
is only to love and trust a man; and the rest follows
as certain as night follows day."</p>

<p>"O little Rose! there is strength where that bitterness
came from; you are worth a dozen dead ones
yet," he said.</p>

<p>The pleasant-spoken woman, who had addressed
Rockman as "uncle," had been absent from the room
a few moments: she now came with water and towels,
and, handing them to him, said, "Now, you two see
that she is well washed; bathe her face, neck, and
arms; it will help to rest her; and after a little I will
bring her some tea and toast."</p>

<p>When this was done, and her supper eaten,
Rockman said, "You will stay here. Miss Rose, for
the present. I have not had a sweetheart for some
time, and I think you will do me if you will be
good."</p>

<p>"Had I no worse men to deal with than you are,
I should never be harmed," was her reply.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure, puss: remember that there
was one woman so lovely that she drew an angel
from the skies, or, rather, God himself, if the book
is true."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Rockman!"</p>

<p>"Shocked, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes: how can you compare me to her who was
counted worthy of being the mother of Jesus?"</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>"And he was counted worthy to be her son; I do
not see but the honors were even; and, as to you
and Mary, I do not know why one loving woman is
any worse or any better than another, only as they
differ in the degrees of their love. If they get
defiled by loving, the defilement is an outside matter,
and not a part of them."</p>

<p>Rose looked bewildered, shocked at the reasoning
used, and Rockman only laughed. "Poor little
one!" he said, "somebody knocked it down, and
trampled on it, and it is ready to die with self-abasement;
better get well, grow strong and self-respecting."</p>

<p>The unhappy, wronged girl dropped her head
upon her hands, and wept convulsively; and Rockman
quietly left the room. As soon as she could
listen, I gave her a few kind words, and then proceeded
to the place I had started to find.</p>

<p>I afterward learned poor Rose's story, gathered
the history of her wrongs from her own lips, and I
must say that I had not deemed such things possible;
but further investigation and experience has shown
me, <i>not only possible, but true</i>.</p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Rockman, or Rockman without
the Mr., as we called him, both because it was
easier, and because it suited him better: I was not
at all pleased with his rough expressions when
strongly excited. I felt that he had a great, warm
heart; but why mar the effect of his manifest goodness?
and I resolved to talk with him seriously upon
the subject. I had not long to wait, for he called
the very next morning.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>As it happened, I answered the bell; and his first
words were, "Well, are you going to let me come
in?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am: why do you ask that?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would change your mind if I
waited long enough," said he as he walked past me
to a seat.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You did not intend to be bothered with me any
more, when I left your house last, madam."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"God told me,&mdash;the God of Eben Rockman; and
he further told me to stay away till you had need of
me; and that time has come."</p>

<p>I could only look my astonishment; and he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You think you do not; but never mind that.
Your spirit called me; and I have come, and am
ready to ease you of some of your load by allowing
you to criticise me.</p>

<p>"Now, don't go out and ask your friends to come
and see a man who has told you all you ever did; for
I have only hinted at a few things that you have
thought, and that only where those thoughts flowed
toward me. I can do it with but now and then one,
and you are of the number."</p>

<p>I thought of Mesmer again, and decided that it
were wise for me to be on my guard.</p>

<p>He read my thought, and said, "You are mistaken,
madam; this comes by no will-power of
mine; neither do I know the law which controls it.
I only know that it is so, and that we have a work
to do with and for each other.</p>

<!-- page 35 -->

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'God moves in a mysterious way,<br/>

His wonders to perform.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"This is very singular," I said at length.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am one of God's peculiar people, and
you are another: only you have not blossomed yet.
A rosebud of one color or variety does not look so
different from that of another; it is the blossom
which tells the story."</p>

<p>"And do you think that I shall ever blossom out
to swear?" I asked, pleased that I had found a path
to what I wished to say, at last.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not: I hope not," he replied.</p>

<p>"What is your reason for hoping that?"</p>

<p>"Because, madam, I do not wish you to have that
kind of work to do; would rather do a double
amount of it myself to save you."</p>

<p>"But I can not see the necessity of its being done
at all, sir."</p>

<p>"I presume you can not; and you have been puzzling
your brain ever since I left you yesterday, as to
how you could convince me that I should not talk
so. I thank you for the compliment you thus
unwittingly give me."</p>

<p>"I can not see any compliment in it. It seems to
me that your language should comport, somewhat
more at least, with your white hairs and venerable
appearance."</p>

<p>"Appearances are deceitful, madam, but the compliment
comes in just here. If you did not believe
that I intend to do right as fast as I see the right,
you would not try to show me an error; for you
would know that it would be of no use."</p>

<!-- page 36 -->

<p>I did not attempt to reply; for I was in doubt
whether to proceed, or drop the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes; go on, I wish to hear your strong reasonings.
It will do you good, if I get no benefit therefrom."</p>

<p>"But, really, Mr. Rockman, can you see any possible
good in the use of such language?"</p>

<p>"Full as much as there is in your putting a
handle to my name; and to me it is a necessity, consequently
of great use. Air will bear but a certain
amount of pressure; when that point is reached,
there must be egress equal to the ingress, or there is
an explosion. The pressure may be so great, and
the means of escape so small, that it comes with a
report like a pistol. This does not suit sensitive
ears; but is it not better than an explosion?"</p>

<p>"I should say it was an explosion, when it comes
with a force like that," I replied, laughing in spite
of myself.</p>

<p>"Yes; an explosive warning, which, if not heeded,
is only a precursor of complete wreck. I wish I
could say smooth things; wish I could draw the
elements from the overcharged mental, moral, and
spiritual atmosphere as quietly as the lightning-rod
draws the electricity from the over-burdened clouds,
and conveys it to the bosom of our common mother,
earth."</p>

<p>"But, my friend, there are principles in the philosophy
of nature which enable us to so construct
the lightning-rod that it can do this: is there not
power enough in the soul, through the application
of spiritual principles, to make us to the moral, what

<!-- page 37 -->

that rod is to the physical, the quiet extractors of
evil?"</p>

<p>"Not extractors, madam, but equalizers. It is
only the unbalanced condition which makes that
which is of itself good, an evil."</p>

<p>"Well, no matter about the terms, so that we get
at the bottom of this question; can we not become
spiritual lightning-rods?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and, were there enough such, all could go
on smoothly; but, where the supply is not equal to
the demand, there must be destruction somewhere,
or those in use must take on an extra charge, shocking
and throwing back those in the vicinity, but,
after all, doing less damage than if the stroke had
come elsewhere.</p>

<p>"I tell you, madam, we are safety-valves, saviors,
though not recognized as such. The pressure
brought to bear on the wronged souls, who have no
voice to speak for themselves, is so great, that, but
for such expression as is forced through lips like
mine, I sometimes think that the very air would take
fire, or the stones cry out. The masses who move
on in the ordinary routine of life are insulated from
all this; shut out, or rather, shut in, as the occupants
of pleasant parlors are shut in from the
winter's blast.</p>

<p>"But there are some who are caught in the
draught when the doors are open: such get some
idea of the strength of the tempest, and they give
an audible shiver. So spiritually, there are tides,
currents, rivers, of human woe that permeate the
moral atmosphere; and there are souls who are so

<!-- page 38 -->

related to these currents that they express the language
of wailing or indignation, with at least a
tithe of the strength with which it comes to them;
they must do this, even at the risk of jarring upon
musical ears, or chilling sensitive plants.</p>

<p>"It would be useless for me to express this to the
multitudes; but there is that in your nature, which
will enable you to comprehend this in part now, and
more fully after a while. Those who are counted as
the prophets of the ancient time were of this class.
They only expressed what came to them by contact
with the inner life of humanity, poured forth in
glowing language the unconscious and yet sensed
possibilities that were borne upon these currents,
gave expression in God's name to the condemnation
of the ignorance, the wrongs, which prevented the
actualization of these possibilities. I tell you, the
kingdom of heaven is within us; we are the temples
of the living God, but, as yet, temples with darkened
windows, and muddy walls. We do not have
to go hence to find God; we only need to purify the
temple; then the glory that is within will shine out.
It is coming, it is coming!" he exclaimed suddenly,
while his face shone as though bathed in
light.</p>

<p>But this changed quickly to a look of intense
suffering, while he added, "But oh the agony of
the purification! for our God is a consuming fire."
And then, as if the atmosphere was becoming too
close for him, he abruptly left the house.</p>

<p>For my part, I was more than astonished; I was
bewildered. Was this man what they called him,
half insane?</p>

<!-- page 39 -->

<p>Well, whatever he was, I would not attempt to
convince him that he was wrong again. I would
take my way, and he must have his without criticism
from me; I was not equal to the task.</p>

<p>But where was this to end? What was to be
the result of the law of sympathy which seemed to
unite us? Should I strive to break it, or should I
let things take their own course? I finally decided
upon the latter, for I must know more of Rose; and,
to see her, I must meet him again, for she was still
where he had taken her the day before. I was
mistaken, however, in my supposition that I should
meet him at the house of Mrs. Thorn (the lady who
had called him uncle). He had taken himself away,
and left Rose wholly to me.</p>

<p>In answer to my inquiry concerning him, Mrs.
Thorn said, "I do not know; he goes and comes as
he pleases, and I never question him."</p>

<p>"But is he really your uncle? or do you only call
him that because of his years, and for acquaintance'
sake?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He is my mother's step-brother, madam, and one
of the best men I ever knew. I am used to his
singular ways, so they do not annoy me as they do
strangers."</p>

<p>"He seems a good man," I remarked, a little
ashamed of the curiosity which prompted my questioning.
"How is Rose to-day?"</p>

<p>"Better in body, but very much depressed. I am
glad you have come. It will do her good. You will
find her up stairs in the front chamber. Please
walk up, and excuse me, for I am very busy," said
she, opening the door, and pointing the way.</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>Rose shuddered, and covered her face with her
hands, when she saw who it was; and I had considerable
difficulty in getting her to talk with me at
all. The full force of her situation was pressing
itself upon her so keenly, that the poor girl seemed
utterly incapable of control.</p>

<p>Finally I calmed her somewhat, and so far won
upon her as to get her to promise that she would
go home with me, if I would come for her after
dark. She was in such a state of mind, that I feared
that she made this as an excuse, and would slip
away from me when I left; so I staid till nearly
night, keeping her mind occupied as well as I could
with subjects that tended to lead her thoughts away
from herself. At last I told her that I had an
errand to do, but would return for her soon; and
then, charging Mrs. Thorn to see that she did not
leave the house till my return, I hastily secured a
carriage, and a policeman to aid me if she attempted
to break from me at the door, and hastened back.</p>

<p>But she made no objection to going with me;
seemed glad that she could ride, and, as the policeman
kept in the shade, had no suspicion of my precautions.
I had resolved to keep her with me, and I
succeeded, even till months lengthened into years;
and I never once had reason to regret doing so. She
took the place of the sister who soon left me for a
home of her own, and was ever after as a sister to
me.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">A THRIVING YOUNG MAN.</p>

</div>

<p>YES, a thriving young man was Robert
Crandall: so every one said who knew
him, and to all appearances they told
the truth; but "things that are, and
things that seem," often bleed in fantastic
strife in this stage of existence.</p>

<p>If to prosper in externals is to thrive, then Robert
Crandall was a thriving young man. If it is to be
cool, calculating, ambitious, and to know how to
adapt means to the accomplishment of self-aggrandizing
schemes, then Robert Crandall was a thriving
young man. But if more than this is required; if
honor, truth, veracity, soul-growth, must be taken
into the account,&mdash;then it might be questioned as
to whether he was what the world called him.</p>

<p>"Why did he not marry?" this was the question
that mammas with daughters to sell often asked, to
themselves at least, even if they were kept from
expressing their query aloud lest they should be
suspected of being interested.</p>

<p>Yes, why did he not marry? Ask that blue-eyed
little woman who stands aside from the crowd, but
follows him with her eyes as he passes, and, when
she sees him lift his hand to his head in a careless

<!-- page 42 -->

and yet peculiar manner,&mdash;ask her, as with a smile
in her eye, she turns and glides quickly away. She
will not say to you that she even knows who he is;
but in her soul she will be thinking, "Some day
they will know that he is married; but not yet, not
yet. Well, I can afford to wait, for he knows best;
but I wish the time would come."</p>

<p>That motion told her that he would be with her
soon. And he,&mdash;he is thinking, "How she loves
me! It is too bad to deceive her so; but a man
can not afford to sacrifice his prospects to a foolish
marriage. And yet she is so sweet and true! She
believes in me as she does in God. And what a face
and form! How the fellows would envy me, if they
knew! But I must keep my secret yet a while, for
I can not do without her: her love gives me life
when I am tired, worn out with anxiety. If I go to
her, my brain becomes clear, my pulse even, and I
can see my way out of any difficulty that comes up."
And then, as if a thought had occurred to him
for the first time, he adds after a moment, "I wonder
if all women are such helps to men."</p>

<p>But he is there now. He ascends the stairs, he
walks in at the open door; it is quickly shut
behind him, and he is as quickly clasped around the
neck by a pair of white arms.</p>

<p>"How is my little wife to-night?" he asks, as he
returns her warm caresses.</p>

<p>"Happy, now you are here, Edwin." You see
that he has not even given her his real name, that
is, his first name. He has a cousin who somewhat
resembles him, whose name is Edwin Crandall; this

<!-- page 43 -->

cousin is "rather wild:" so, if Robert's affair should
leak out, it would be laid to Edwin, and people
would think it only another of his <i>liaisons</i>.</p>

<p>When Robert Crandall first met Clara Warren, he
was poor and disheartened. He felt dissatisfied with
himself and with every thing about him; but having,
through the kindness of an uncle, been well educated,
his manners were those of a gentleman; and,
being what is called magnetic, readily made friends.
His mother was from a proud family, and, failing to
reach the mark of her ambition, stamped the feeling
upon her son with such an intensity that success
was the god to which he sacrificed.</p>

<p>All else was swallowed up, lost, in the one desire
to make his mark in the world; to be looked up to,
courted, honored. Still this man had the same
needs as other men have; was not sensual in any
true sense of that term; could not have been
satisfied with the paid harlot's caress; must have
love, must have the sweet caress that comes from
love; but this must not be at the expense of his
ruling passion, ambition. All the aids that he could
secure were admissible, desirable; but nothing must
stand in the way.</p>

<p>As I have said, he was depressed, disheartened,
when he met Clara Warren. Her presence, her
smile, thrilled, filled him with new life, gave him
power to do; and of course she must be his. He
succeeded in taking her from her home, and making
her believe that she was his wife; but it was&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 44 -->

<p class="small">"Power assumed by one who had none,&mdash;<br/>

Priestly robe and saintly face:<br/>

Thus they lured the trusting maiden,<br/>

Thus they snared her youthful feet;<br/>

But the soul, in unstained whiteness.<br/>

This their plotting could not reach."</p>

<p>He who aided in the plot supposed that it was
simply a joke, a frolic that neither party had any
intention of carrying out, and thought no more
about it. Going to sea soon after, even this possible
witness was removed from his path. So Robert
Crandall had things all his own way; and Clara,
pure, sweet, innocent Clara, waited patiently for the
day when he could acknowledge her before the
world, without incurring the anger of his "rich
uncle."</p>

<p>"I do not care for his wealth, my bird: I had
rather owe success to my own efforts. But I want his
influence for a time. If that was turned against me
now, I fear that I should fail in what I have undertaken."</p>

<p>And Clara listened and believed, while Robert
planned and prospered; she never once dreaming
that she was contributing to his success, that her
<i>life forces</i> were being worked up in the results of his
efforts. Oh, no! she was only an expense to him;
but he loved her so much, that it was no burden for
him to care for her, to furnish her with food and
clothing.</p>

<p>This was what she thought, and what women are
taught to think. But this will change some time.
As well say that the sun contributes nothing to the

<!-- page 45 -->

products of the earth because it neither plows,
sows, nor harvests. But the sun is not subject to
man; if it were, he would pay for its warmth as he
pays woman for her favors, and think it enough
that he was taking care of that luminary, because it
had no executive power, could not be self-supporting.
If the inhabitants of the sun were dependent
on this earth for food and raiment, would not the
quickening warmth received therefrom be sufficient
compensation without their coming here to sow and
reap?</p>

<p>Woman is the sun of our social system, or should
be; would be, were she not dragged from her place
by impious hands; and, as such, should be as
independent of man's control, as is the sun of the
earth's.</p>

<p>But to return to Robert Crandall and Clara Warren.
Robert, as we have said, prospered from the
time he met Clara. She gave her forces, her love-life
to him; he gave his to his business: consequently
there came a time when she had nothing
more to give, for an unreplenished fountain must
some time become dry. Robert continued to visit,
to gather her life-forces; till at last she closed her
beautiful eyes, folded her hands upon her breast,
and went to her final sleep,&mdash;went thinking how
kind he had been to her, and how lonely he would
be without her.</p>

<p>"You will take me home," she said, "and bury
me by my mother. And tell father and sister that
I was really your wife."</p>

<p>He promised, and intended then to do as she

<!-- page 46 -->

wished; but afterward prudential reasons caused
him to decide otherwise.</p>

<p>She lay a few moments in silence after he had
made her this promise, and then added, "I am so
glad you could be here! I feared that the business
which detained you would keep you till it was too
late; and it would have been so sad for you to have
come, and found that your Clara had left you!"</p>

<p>Self-forgetful to the last, thinking only of him;
if love is the fulfilling of the law, surely she was not
lacking.</p>

<p>To say that Robert did not mourn her loss would
be false. He felt for a time that the light of his
life had gone out. He missed her smile; he missed
her cooling hand upon his tired brain, and in every
other way where she had been a blessing to <i>him</i>,
He did not once think of her in any other light, did
not think of what she might have become in and of
herself. It was <i>his</i> loss that he mourned.</p>

<p>A few weeks, and he saw another face that pleased
him, listened to another voice that charmed. But
this time he found a more ready acquiescence. The
girl loved him as well, was as earnest, and as innocent
in her nature, as was Clara; but her education
had been different, and she did not sense as fully the
necessity of the form, if the spirit of marriage was
present. She loved William Smith (another false
name), and he loved her; and, if he thought so, that
was enough. The world would say that she was
bad; but the world judged falsely (as it generally
does). It was Robert Crandall who knew better:
he was the one who was bad, for he did not intend
to do rightly by her, and she did by him.</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>Minnie Morris had a different style of beauty from
Clara Warren, was more sparkling, and less gentle
in her manners; and Robert loved to tease her occasionally,
"just to see the fire flash from her eyes,"
as he said.</p>

<p>Once, when he had provoked her more than
usual, she turned upon him with, "William Smith,
you will be sorry for this some day."</p>

<p>"Why, what will you do, puss?"</p>

<p>"Will find out if you have lied to me."</p>

<p>"And what then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It will be time enough to decide when that time
comes," was her prompt response.</p>

<p>"Well, darling, you really do look dangerous. I
guess I had better behave myself," he continued in a
tone of pleasant raillery; and so there was peace for
the time.</p>

<p>Robert's business did not prosper quite as well as
it did while Clara lived, for he could not absorb
Minnie as readily; still he was remarkably successful,
and on the high road to fortune. He rather
liked her spunk. He said to his particular friend,
Charles Reading, "And when I tire of her, and wish
to leave, I have only to make her angry, and the
thing is done."</p>

<p>You see, he had changed, was becoming more and
more the man of the world; was learning that a new
love was one of the necessities of a man of business.
"Life's elixir," he termed it. Still he was rather
constant: Minnie remained with him nearly three
years, and during that time he had added to his possessions
over six thousand dollars. Now, whose money

<!-- page 48 -->

was it? The law, human law, <i>man</i>-made law, gave
it to him; but the law of love, of justice, of equity,
would have given her one-half of it. To our sorrow,
however, we are not under the jurisdiction of these.
Love is the fulfilling of the law; but love's law is not
obeyed, or only, if at all, at a most terrible cost.</p>

<p>The time came at length when Robert cared no
longer for Minnie's company; and, with the ready tact
of a preconceived plan, she was provoked beyond
endurance, and he was so offended that he refused to
be appeased. "He would give her a small sum to
aid her till she could look about a little; perhaps she
could please herself better; he could not put up with
her temper any longer, and he was doing better by
her than many would do under the circumstances,
but he could not bear to see her go out penniless:"
so he said.</p>

<p>And so poor Minnie was turned away with a paltry
sum that could last her but a few weeks at best. The
babe that was the fruit of their union was dead; and
the mother, heart-broken, and depreciated in body and
soul, was thus cast upon the market of lust to be sold
for her keeping.</p>

<p>Well, the sacrifice of the ages will be complete
some time; and then the "refining fire" will consume
the altar itself.</p>

<p>"But why did she not go to work?" you will ask.
Ah, and who would employ her? Would that respectable
lady whose lover meets her by stealth at
night, and deals out the bread and wine to kneeling
communicants the next sabbath morning? Of course
not: she can not encourage vice by taking such a
character into her house.</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>Will that calm, blue-eyed beauty (if beauty can
be soulless) who is as cold as ice, and as chaste as
snow? Not she, indeed! for how can she understand
the power of the creative fire that responds to
the touch of its kindred flame? The fact that a
woman has yielded herself to love is proof positive
to her of total depravity; and such must not be sheltered
in her house. She, of course, is an <i>obedient</i>
wife; but her husband must not come into daily contact
with such a creature.</p>

<p>And thus we might go the entire round of respectable
holiness, with perhaps now and then a rare
exception; and those exceptions poor Minnie knew
not where to find; and so, with a soul shrinking from
her fate, she is drawn into the whirlpool in which so
many rare gems are ingulfed.</p>

<p>But she does not yield without a struggle, and
Robert Crandall's steps are watched. She is not long
in learning that he had given her a false name; and,
this clew gained, she tracks him till she has learned
the story of his connection with Clara; then she sets
herself to find Clara's friends. But this was not so
easy a task, and for a long time she was completely
baffled.</p>

<p>But the hate that comes from wronged, outraged
love is as persevering as the fates; and Minnie was
no tame character. She would have been a superior
angel; but, cheated of this her birthright, she becomes
a splendid devil,&mdash;devil so far as her hatred of men,
and her arts to accomplish their ruin, were concerned;
but angel still to the innocent and wronged of her
own sex.</p>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>Many a man who had, as he supposed, his victim
just within his grasp, found himself suddenly and
entirely defeated, and some one else thrown across his
path to whom he himself became the victim. Finding
that the door to an honest living was closed
against her, she coolly looked her fate in the face, and
made friends with the "mammon of unrighteousness."</p>

<p>In this work of love and revenge, Eben Rockman
became her friend and ally; but she set about that
work too late to save poor Rose, who became his next
victim. Neither did Rockman learn aught of her
wrongs till the day that he took her from the street
in his arms, and bore her to a place of safety. Something
of the steps taken by Crandall to accomplish
his object was learned from Rose herself, but more
through Minnie and those she set upon his track.
Crandall had a clerk in his business, a sort of head
man, of whom he sometimes made a confidant: they
were together when he first met Rose, and his first
remark was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look there, James!" pointing in a way that
seemed a careless, unpremeditated movement, in the
direction from which she was coming, "did you ever
see her equal? One could sip the nectar of the gods
from those lips."</p>

<p>"Better not let Minnie catch you at such sipping,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Minnie! Pshaw I do you suppose I am to be tied
to her apron-strings? no, indeed! and she is becoming
tiresome too, altogether too imperious. I had as
soon break with her as not."</p>

<!-- page 51 -->

<p>"But you are not certain of getting this one; and
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, you
know."</p>

<p>"The bird in the hand might frighten the bird out
of the bush, and then there would be no chance of
securing it, so I will run the risk of letting the one
in hand go."</p>

<p>This conversation was related by James to Minnie
afterward. "I would have warned her," he said,
"but I had no opportunity of doing so: I did not
meet Rose again till it was too late, and he never
spoke to me of her after that day. I think he must
have read something in my face that warned him not
to trust me."</p>

<p>"But why have you come to me with this now?"
asked Minnie, looking at him as if she suspected that
his motives were none of the best.</p>

<p>James blushed beneath her gaze, but replied frankly,
"I always liked you. Miss Morris; but, knowing
that you loved Crandall, I felt that it would be useless
for me to say a word as long as you could hold
him. But, now that the breach between you is
irreparable, I hoped that you would look favorably
upon me."</p>

<p>"And so you thought to win my favor by telling
me his faults; that is honest, to say the least; and, on
one condition, I do not know but it may be as you
wish," she replied.</p>

<p>"Name the condition!" he exclaimed eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not quite so fast, as you may not like to agree to
it when you hear it."</p>

<p>"But please give me the chance of deciding without
the torture of suspense. Miss Morris."</p>

<!-- page 52 -->

<p>"Miss Morris: very respectful now, sir."</p>

<p>The young man looked her in the face, but made
no reply. He saw that she was in the mood for teasing,
and so would not be hurried. Finding that he
did not speak, she continued, "Men stand by their
own sex, and women turn against theirs."</p>

<p>"Quite true," he assented, "but there are exceptions
to all rules."</p>

<p>"I mean to be one exception, James, and I want
you to be another. I intend to stand by my sex, and
fight yours; and I want you to work with me, to help
me defeat such as are trying to ruin the innocent.
If you see a wolf in sheep's clothing on the track of
a lamb, I want you to come and tell me, and help me
to save them, and to throw such as are already
branded across the track instead. Pledge this, and
I am yours."</p>

<p>"I will pledge it till I meet one who attracts me
stronger than yourself, which I do not think likely to
occur soon."</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon his arm, and lifted her eyes
to his with a pleading gaze. "And if she be innocent
you will marry her? Think of it, James: is it not
enough that society accords to you the privilege of
taking a pure girl to your bosom as a wife, after you
have mingled with us, but it gives us no such chance
of getting husbands: think of this; and think, if you
should live to have a daughter, would you not like
to feel, as she looked you in the face, that you had
never wronged such?"</p>

<p>"I will promise," he said, more moved than he
liked to own. And so their strange compact was concluded;

<!-- page 53 -->

she taking a house, and boarding such as
wished, or had no other alternative than to live what
the world calls free lives, but which is in fact the
most terrible slavery; and he aiding her in seeing to it
that no unwilling victims were brought thither. But,
as I have said, this was too late to save poor Rose.</p>

<p>Robert Crandall knew that the utmost caution and
skill were needed if he should succeed with Rose
Barron, but this did not deter him in the least from
the pursuit. What strange pertinacity is this which
causes a man to pursue so unrelentingly, and then
after possession to throw away so carelessly, so
heartlessly?</p>

<p>I have sometimes thought it was a disease, or species
of madness. If so, it is a madness upon which society
looks without seeing, of which it takes no
account; but woe, woe to the victims who come within
its power!</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the citadel of the heart was
giving away to the insidious approaches that were
being made, till at length Rose loved. She showed
this by the light in her eye, the deepening color upon
her cheek, and the sweet cooing cadence, that, unconsciously
to herself, crept into the undertones of her
voice.</p>

<p>Crandall marked all these, and yet dared not venture
by any word or act to show his real purpose.
But, while he was thus careful and deferential, his
magnetism, his sphere as Swedenborg would call it,
was permeated with intense passion; and Rose in her
loving had become receptive to this sphere, took it in
as air will receive escaping gas, even till a match

<!-- page 54 -->

lighted in the room will set it on fire. She did not
comprehend the nature of this feeling; neither did
he intend that she should. But still it was pervading
her entire being, running along her nerves with
a strange thrill, mounting to and bewildering her
brain. She had no power to think, to reason; and,
when the moment came that the besieger decided to
storm the castle, she had no power to resist.</p>

<p>And this was the being that the pharisaical ones,
the cold and calculating ones, the false, the hypocritical
ones, together with the ignorantly innocent, and
the untempted ones,&mdash;this was the being that these,
all these, presumed to call fallen!</p>

<p>Great heaven! and is this a Christian people? does
Christian morality presume to lift its head here? Is
this the Christ charity, the Christ love and tenderness?
Out upon such hypocrisy! It is condemned,
damned, cursed, and only waits the execution of the
sentence that has been pronounced against it.</p>

<p>Do you say that I am getting to be as bad as Rockman?
Perhaps: as page after page of society's
workings open before me, as the wrong, the outrage
that I find so prevalent, becomes manifest, I sometimes
think that I shall become worse.</p>

<p>Still I meet with good people, kind, tender-hearted
people, everywhere. Touch the right chords, and the
sweet music of sympathy gushes forth like the song of
spring birds. The husband and father toils unceasingly
for wife and little ones; the mother will even give
her own life to save her children. The sick man's
couch is watched the livelong night by the neighbor
who knows that there can be no release from the
next day's toil.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>What does it all mean? so much goodness, so much
evident desire to do the right, and yet so much wrong!
Even Robert Crandall, I have no doubt, once thought
only of being a good boy, and was till some strong
desire, something that he wanted so badly, came in
conflict; and so on, till the man forgot all but self.</p>

<p>Why is it that our wants, our needs, so conflict?
Are we not all the victims of false conditions?
Who will help me to solve this problem, so that if
condemnation must fall it shall not fall amiss?</p>

<p>But let me return to the point from which I have
wandered. I shrink from the finale, and yet it must
be told. Crandall, as he sat beside Rose, silent, and
seemingly abashed at the boldness of what he had
done, was expecting a storm of tears and reproaches,
and, as they did not come, was wondering what
course she would take, when she laid her hand on his
arm with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Robert, we have been carried beyond ourselves,
and there is only one course open to us."</p>

<p>The calmness with which these words were uttered
disturbed him more than any amount of upbraiding
would have done. "<i>We</i> have been carried beyond
ourselves:" she had no suspicion, then, that it was
premeditated on his part; no condemnation, but only
holding him to the right by taking it for granted that
he would be but too glad to place their relations on
a recognized basis, for he knew, without asking, that
she referred to an immediate marriage.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" he sighed: "I wish I had controlled
myself, for it will be impossible for me to marry
you"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 56 -->

<p>"Impossible to marry me!" she exclaimed, springing
to her feet.</p>

<p>"Wait, will you, till I have finished what I was
going to say," he interrupted, in an impatient tone.
"It will be impossible for me to marry you immediately;
of course I shall do so soon."</p>

<p>"Soon, how soon?"</p>

<p>"It will be at least a month before I can bring
things into shape to make it convenient," was his
reply; this with his eyes fixed on the ground, for,
hardened as he was, he could not look her in the face.</p>

<p>Rose stood like one stunned. She had not doubted
him till now. Her face became the hue of death,
and her hands were like ice; another moment, and she
had fallen at his feet as unconscious as the dead.
When she came to herself he was bending over her
with a frightened look; and, as soon as he saw that
she could hear him he began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rose, don't, oh, don't feel so! indeed I will bring
things about as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>He was distressed, frightened; but, as she interpreted
it, not on her account, but lest she should do
something desperate, and thus bring him into difficulty.
She, however, gathered hope from his manner,
and promised to trust him for a few days, a week
at least.</p>

<p>He continued to see her as usual, invented excuses
that put marriage two weeks ahead instead of one,
venturing, after a few days, to approach her again.
He was repulsed so thoroughly that he saw that
while he had overcome he had not subdued her; that
she was so thoroughly shocked and steadied, that

<!-- page 57 -->

there was no further hope for him, only through the
channel which she most firmly believed came the right
to the relation he desired; to wit, the legal sanction.</p>

<p>No amount of argument or sophistry could move
her in the least. This angered him, roused his worst
feelings, and lashed them into fury; he would not
be thus defeated; if he could not conquer in one
way, he would in another. True, his heart plead,
"Why not marry her and be happy? She is more to
you than another ever can be; you love her as you
never have loved, and you know that you do."</p>

<p>But pride, ambition, said, "No, she is poor, and,
though very lovely, not the one to help you in your
upward career: her stern sense of right would be
sure to stand in the way, to defeat your plans."
Ambition triumphed, and he thrust his cup of life
from his lips. But the demon in his nature was
aroused; he would hold her in his arms again, at all
hazards; so he drugged, and managed to have her
conveyed where she could not escape him, and then,
day by day, and week by week, wreaked the passion,
that, from its perversion, had become hellish, upon
her defenseless form.</p>

<p>This, till thoroughly sated; and then he turned her
over to another, for it would not do to let her escape
and tell her story. And for these wrongs that were
heaped upon her she was counted vile.</p>

<p>She managed to escape at length, and, reeling from
weakness and despair, she had fallen in the street;
and it was thus that we found her. And could not
this man be brought to justice? you ask. How? he
had given her a false name also, called himself Robert

<!-- page 58 -->

Wilson, and always went in partial disguise when
he visited her. His business was unknown to her, as
was his real position in society; and how was she to
track him out?</p>

<p>Besides, she was so broken in spirit that she had
no courage to act; and, shrinking as she naturally
was, how could she go before the great world and
declare the indignities to which she had been subjected?
For a long time we could not learn who
was the real author of her wrongs; but finally Rockman
got upon his track, and, with the aid of Minnie
and her friend James, succeeded, at length, in identifying
him.</p>

<p>After leaving Rose, he had made no more efforts in
the direction of unlawful love. Indeed, he sickened
at the very thought of love, made no pretensions to
it whatever, and that which his nature demanded he
went to the paid harlot for. He seemed to have
overacted, and to have recoiled from the shock that
his course had produced: business did not thrive
with him as formerly; and it was a question as to
whether he could so harden himself as to go on, or
whether he should yield and go down. The restless
hungering that had taken possession of him, since he
no longer received the caress, the magnetism, of real
love, well nigh drove him to the love of strong drink.
Finally, however, the ruling passion, ambition, triumphed,
and he took up life once more with a firm
hand. True, his heart had turned to ashes; but he
urned it in a marble heart of the natural hue and
size, and the world saw not the difference.</p>

<p>His brain cleared, at least the portion of it brought

<!-- page 59 -->

into action; and he decided, that, to go forward to the
goal desired, it was necessary that he should marry.
So he began to look about for the one who could
bring him the most wealth, family influence, and
personal dignity: he wanted a queenly creature, one
who could command homage as she walked by his
side. Tall and finely formed himself, he wanted people
to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a fine-looking couple!"</p>

<p>He soon fixed upon one that he thought would
suit; and now he taxed his energies as entirely to win
her openly as he had hitherto done to win the others
secretly; and he succeeded, for, as you already know,
he was a thriving man, though not quite so young as
once; still a young man, for he had seen only thirty
summers.</p>

<p>Lucelle Loudan was a fitting mate for Robert
Crandall: proud, imperious, cold, ambitious, and
counted regal in her beauty. He told her of his
purpose to win a high place in society, that he had
struggled alone, had worshiped her at a distance,
hoping to be able one day to offer her the position
that she deserved, but that he had concluded that he
could climb better, faster, with her by his side; would
she consent to aid him by becoming his honored wife?</p>

<p>Flattered by his preference, his courtly address,
and the expression of sentiments so in accordance
with her own, she consented to give what he asked,
her <i>hand</i>; and the preparations for the bridal commenced.</p>

<p>But one day a letter was handed her, that, when
she had read it, she started up with flashing eye, and
demanded of the waiter who brought it.</p>

<!-- page 60 -->

<p>"The gentleman waits in the parlor, and would
like to see you." She descended thither quickly, and
found Eben Rockman in waiting.</p>

<p>"You?" she said when she saw him, surprise for
the moment overcoming every other feeling.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Loudan, Lucelle. I have known you
from a child; and though, since to womanhood grown,
you have ignored your eccentric but true friend, yet
I could not be silent, and see you taking a step
which, if you have any real womanhood, must make
you wretched."</p>

<p>"You refer, I presume, to my approaching marriage
with Mr. Crandall," she said, drawing herself up
proudly; "and I must say that it well becomes one
who is known to be on intimate terms with as notorious
a character as is Minnie Morris, to bring such
accusations as are contained in your letter, against
one whose reputation is as unsullied as is that of my
promised husband."</p>

<p>"It was he, Miss Loudan, who made Minnie Morris
what she is."</p>

<p>"It is false, false as her own vile heart; and this
story is some of her concocting."</p>

<p>"You mistake, Lucelle: I learned it first from other
sources, and can bring proof of what I state. My
connection with Miss Morris only relates to aiding
her in saving young girls from just such men as Robert
Crandall, <i>alias</i> Edward Crandall, <i>alias</i> William
Smith, <i>alias</i> Robert Wilson."</p>

<p>"Aiding a keeper of a house of infamy in saving
young girls! really, now, do you expect me to believe
so absurd a statement?"</p>

<!-- page 61 -->

<p>"Lucelle! you dare not look me in the face, and
tell me that you believe I would lie to you."</p>

<p>"I dare to call you an insane fool, and to ask you
to leave this house, and never enter it again."</p>

<p>"I obey you," he said, rising; "but it shall be more
tolerable for Minnie Morris in the day of judgment
than for you."</p>

<p>And so the marriage took place,&mdash;a mockery of
what marriage should be; and still it was marriage,
for the active faculties of each were in unison, they
both bowed at the shrine of ambition, were united in
their purpose to rise at any and every cost to their
higher selves, or to others. It was a union of what
was left of two dwarfed souls.</p>

<p>So Robert Crandall, the thriving young man, became
the successful, the wealthy married man, and
the world looked on and envied; people were proud
of him as a man and a citizen; and his victims were
never mentioned, never thought of, by those who
courted his smiles.</p>

<p>But there is a day coming that shall burn as an
oven; and the wood, hay, stubble, gold, silver, precious
stones, whatever men and women have gathered
that can not stand its intensity, must be consumed,
while they themselves will be saved as by fire; and
Heaven help Robert Crandall then!</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE OTHER SIDE.</p>

</div>

<p>"I WISH people would ever look at the
other side of a thing before deciding
upon it," said Rockman, as he walked
into my sitting-room one morning without
as much as saying, "By your leave."
I had long since given up the idea of shutting him
out, or being in any way afraid of him; and he came
and went at his own convenience as if at home, as,
in fact, he was when he chose to be.</p>

<p>"What now, Eben?"</p>

<p>"Nothing new; only I do not like one-sided arguments,
though perhaps inclined to make them myself
sometimes. I have just been hearing the song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'The world is what we make it.'</p>

</div>

<p>Which is all very true; and yet it is equally true, that
we are what the world makes us."</p>

<p>"The world seems to have but little influence
upon some people either way," I replied.</p>

<p>"And yet those very ones may be more easily influenced
than others, if you touch them rightly. Do
you remember, child, the day you gave me such a
schooling for talking so roughly?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," I replied, laughing at the recollection.</p>

<!-- page 63 -->

<p>"I presume you think you did not influence me in
the least; but I have either so enlarged my capacity
that I can hold a greater amount of indignation
without exploding, or I am really softening down;
now, which is it?"</p>

<p>"There may be some truth in both suppositions.
Uncle Eben; but there is still another cause, of
which you do not seem to have thought."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"You have divided the load; Minnie and I are
helping you carry it."</p>

<p>"There, you have given me the other side, and I
understand it better now. Why, if you will believe
it, I have chided myself for this very modification,
have feared that I was becoming hardened."</p>

<p>"Well you need not; for, if what I sometimes feel
were thrown back upon you, I fear you would outdo
even your old self in cursing conditions, to say nothing
of what Minnie carries. To use your own illustration,
it is like using three lightning-rods where
formerly there was but one; for, being in direct sympathy
with you, we aid you to carry off in deeds the
forces that formerly had to explode in words."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! what a philosopher you have become!"
he exclaimed; "but I have another side to
show, as well as you. You remember Wellby, with
his two thousand on interest, his rise of property,
and his rent-roll, together with the good that he
boasted of doing with his money; to wit, giving
poor men the chance to work so that they could live."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember, and have often thought I should
like to know what he was doing now, how he was

<!-- page 64 -->

employing men since that house was finished; the
one on the last of his four lots here, I mean. I do
not know how many lots he may have bought since,
or how many houses he may have had put up in
some other part of the city."</p>

<p>"Well there is another side to that question; and
if he could see the workings of the system which
has made him rich, if he could see its effects on that
other side, I hardly think that even he is selfish
enough to boast of the good he does with the money
thus obtained.</p>

<p>"In the first place, how came he by the money
with which he bought those lots? Was it by any
worth or industry of his own? Not in the least.
His father took what was thought a worthless piece
of ground in payment of a liquor bill; took it because
he could get nothing else. This piece of land became
valuable in time; not that it had changed its
nature, not that it had become better calculated to
produce what would support human beings; but
because there had been some unexpected improvements
put up in the vicinity, and, by grading down
and filling up, it would be valuable for business
purposes.</p>

<p>"It was sold; and, the elder Wellby dying soon
after, this son inherited his portion of the proceeds.
The widow of the man who had sold the lot was
poor; and her children were growing up in ignorance
and rags, were being fitted for paupers or
criminals. To say nothing of the uses or abuses of
strong drink, had the elder Wellby taken the principal
and interest of the original debt out of the

<!-- page 65 -->

proceeds of the sale of what had become valuable
through no exertion of his, and then handed the
balance to that widow to aid her in bringing up her
family, it would have looked a little more like justice.
It should have belonged to her children, instead of
his."</p>

<p>"But how have you found all this out?" I asked:
"are you certain of its correctness?"</p>

<p>"I found it out because I sought for it; and I
know that what I have learned is a correct statement
of facts," he replied; "and I have learned, too, that
more than one widow has contributed her mite to the
building-up of this man's fortune,&mdash;contributed
through the force of circumstances which said, 'Your
money, or your life.' "</p>

<p>"Eben Rockman, was there ever a text of Scripture,
a common saying, or any thing else, that you
could not quote, or use to illustrate your ideas, when
you wished?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What now, child?"</p>

<p>"Who but you would have thought to use the
robber's argument in that relation?"</p>

<p>"I do not know as any one would; but it is so
perfectly natural, that I can not understand how a
wayfaring man, though a fool, could fail to see the
justice of the application. But, to go on with <i>the
other side</i> that I was showing up: those six lots
that Wellby bought with the 'ready money' he
happened to have by him belonged to a widow also;
and she could not keep them because she was not
able to pay the taxes, and make the improvements
that the city demanded."</p>

<!-- page 66 -->

<p>"I was not aware," I said, "that people were
obliged to improve their own property, or sell it."</p>

<p>"Not where such improvement would not add to
the general wealth, madam; not where rich people
do not need aid to become richer. We never grind
the poor for nothing."</p>

<p>"I wish you would explain this matter, for I can
not understand it."</p>

<p>"And that is what I will, if you will give me
time, little woman."</p>

<p>"All the time you need, if you will only make it
plain: I want to see the exact workings of a system
that seems to me like a mill where one portion of the
people are ground, used up, for the benefit of another
portion," was my reply.</p>

<p>"And those who are thus ground prove any thing
but the bread of life: such flesh and blood has little
of the saving power attributed to the blood of Christ."</p>

<p>"Why should it have?"</p>

<p>"And why should it not have, if the Scriptures are
true in the sense we have been taught to understand
them? We are there told that the sufferings of
Christ are fulfilled in his members. 'Inasmuch
as ye have done it to the least of these my disciples,
ye have done it unto me.' Now, if the broken
body and shed blood of Jesus has such saving power,
why should not that which is ground from his members,
that which is a part of his body, be efficacious
also?"</p>

<p>"I get a glimmer of a sense in which it is; but we
shall never get to the explanation, uncle (I had
taken to calling him that for convenience), if we keep
on making digressions."</p>

<!-- page 67 -->

<p>"True, but the explanation will keep: you promised
me all the time I needed, and there is such a
thing as digressions helping the main point. I do
not know as I can illustrate this grinding process,
this species of civilized, of Christian robbery, better
than by telling you a story, 'a true story,' as my boy
used to ask for, before God took him. I had a friend
who several years since went to a Western State, and
bought a few acres of land on the outskirts of a thriving
village. He put up a small but comfortable
house, and set out some three acres of ground to
fruit, mostly of the smaller kind, together with a few
peach, apple, and dwarf-pear trees.</p>

<p>"He was consumptive, did not expect to remain
here many years, and wished to provide his family
with a comfortable means of support; and he saw in
the growing tendency of a neighboring city a ready
market for what he was thus cultivating. Finding
his health failing fast, he sold all but the three acres
thus appropriated, and used the money to put what
was left in the best possible shape for those for whose
future he was thus caring, his dearly loved wife and
children.</p>

<p>"This man was a member of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, and a Christian if I ever saw one; and
after doing all that he could for his family, he closed
his eyes in death, committing his widow and fatherless
ones to God, relying upon the Scripture promise
that they would be cared for. The village grew, and
its limits enlarged till it became an incorporated city.
Several wealthy members of the church of which this
woman, whom for the sake of convenience I will call

<!-- page 68 -->

the Widow Brown, was a communicant, bought lots
near her, and commenced putting up residences.</p>

<p>"But these men were business men: they must go
every day to the business part of the city, and they
wanted a sidewalk. And still another reason why a
sidewalk should be built was, that a new church was
to be put up soon; and, if they could secure its location
in that part of the city, it would induce those
who were of the Methodist faith, who should move
thither to settle there, so as to be near their place
of worship. Mr. Blank owned ten acres just beyond
his own residence, which was at the outskirts in that
direction; so, if he could only get the church out
there, he might in time make himself independently
rich.</p>

<p>"But, to bring this all about, there must be some
wire-pulling, some planning done. Now, it happens
that Mr. Ledger owns land in that direction also; so
they put their heads together, look over the probabilities
of success, and decide accordingly. There must
be an <i>appearance</i> of growth in that direction. A
stranger comes into town a few days after, and, after
looking around a while, buys a lot of Mr. Blank (it
is so supposed), and talks of building; will do so right
away, if there can only be a walk made to the business
part of the place, and the street so improved
otherwise that it will be passable at all times.</p>

<p>" 'Well, I don't know,' says Blank reflectively:
'what do you think, Mr. Ledger?'</p>

<p>"Mr. Ledger wishes it could be done; for he
knows of two or three parties who would build out
there, were it not for the badness of the street in
muddy weather.</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>" 'I will tell you what we can do,' says Blank: 'we
can lay the matter before those who live out this
way, and those who own property here and would
come if this could be done, and see what they say
about it. If we can get them, or a majority of them,
to sign a petition to that effect, we will present it to
the "city fathers;" and perhaps we can get them to
decree that it shall be done. Each owner will have
to build that portion of the walk in front of his own
lot; but where it crosses the street, and whatever is
done to the street itself, will have to be raised by tax.
It will make the taxes high, and they may object to
such a drain on the city treasury; but the increased
value of property, even with a lower rate of taxation,
after another year will soon replenish that. We can
try what can be done, anyhow. I had rather give the
city a lot than to have it fail.'</p>

<p>"They did try, and they succeeded too; for one or
two of the <i>city fathers</i> owned property in that part
of the city also. The next move was to get the
church there. And this, too, was accomplished; for
those men who were to be benefited gave largely.
But the hardness of that pavement bruised the feet
or, rather, the hearts, of those fatherless ones; and
the shadow of that church took the roof from over
their heads.</p>

<p>"The Widow Brown must build her proportion of
the pavement; and she had twenty rods of ground
fronting on the street. She must also pay her fate
of the increased amount of taxation; and, as the
valuation of her place had thus been increased, this
was no small addition to her burden. Her returns

<!-- page 70 -->

from fruit and garden had been even less than usual,
and sickness in her family had laid a heavy bill of
expense upon her, and it was impossible for her to
build the walk; so the city must do it, and charge
it to the estate.</p>

<p>"Brother Blank visits her about this time; and, as
he is a member of the same church, she consults
him. He thinks a while, and then says, 'Sister
Brown, I am really sorry for you. It is too bad for
you to have to give up your home upon which
Brother Brown spent so much time and care; but I
do not see how it is to be avoided. I fear you will
have to sell.'</p>

<p>'But I do not know of any one who wishes to
buy,' replies the widow with a tremor in her voice
that is almost a sob.</p>

<p>"Another silence. Brother Blank is very much
affected himself. Finally he says, 'Well, sister, I
will do what I can for you. I will try to find you a
purchaser.'</p>

<p>"Brother Blank leaves; and Widow Brown thinks,
'What a good Christian brother he is!'</p>

<p>"A few weeks pass, and Brother Blank calls again.
'Well, sister, I have not succeeded in finding a
purchaser yet. How are you getting along? any
hope of being able to keep the place?'</p>

<p>"He says this with a cheery voice, as though he
really expected she was going to reply, 'Yes, things
are growing brighter;' and when he finds the reverse
his faces clouds, and his tone changes to one of sympathy.
After a little he says, 'I have about all on
my hands I can attend to; but, if you will give me

<!-- page 71 -->

time, I do not know but, to save you trouble, I will
try and take your place, if you will let me have it at
a reasonable price. I can pay you the interest till I
can sell a portion of it, and, as fast as I can, will pay
the principal.'</p>

<p>" 'What can you afford to give, and how much time
do you want?' is the reply, speaking cheerfully of
what but a short time before she could scarcely bear
to think; for the prospect of having the pressure
removed for the moment makes her forget the
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Again Brother Blank thinks a while, and finally
says, 'I think I might pay you half of it in two
years, and the balance at the end of four; and I will
give you'&mdash;so much; naming a sum that was about
what the property was worth taken at the old valuation,
but much less than it could have been sold for
with the improvements that were being made in that
neighborhood; and remember that it was because her
place had been made to contribute to those improvements
that she was obliged to sell.</p>

<p>" 'If you can pay me something in advance, say
two hundred dollars, I will do so,' is her reply; and
so the bargain is completed. Brother Blank thinking
that he has done the fair thing by the widow. 'It
will be better for her,' he says to himself, 'to leave
the city, and go into some smaller place; and now I
will have a good residence put up in the place of that
little house, which really spoils the looks of the
street.'</p>

<p>"Brother Blank put up the new house; and in six
months sold half the ground for more than he was to

<!-- page 72 -->

pay for the whole, retaining to himself the half on
which the new house was built. So you see, that,
with a little management, he got half of Widow
Brown's place for nothing. He could have paid her
up then, thus giving her a chance to have invested
her money in something that would have increased
in value, while values were on the increase; but so
said not the bond, and she was forced to plan and
contrive to eke out her scanty income the best way
she could."</p>

<p>I had listened without interrupting Mr. Rockman,
for I wished to retain every point in the story; but
now I asked, "How did you learn all this, so as to
relate the particulars so minutely?"</p>

<p>"I have preached in that church," was the reply:
"my sister's child is Brother Blank's wife. I have
been behind the scenes. I know how much religion
there is in church building, and in business men who
furnish the money, and hold the best pews. We are
a thievish Christian nation: we devour widows'
houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. The
condemnation of justice, of a just God, rests upon us,
and it ought to. There! does that manner of expressing
it suit you any better than the other?"</p>

<p>"Some better, I think," I said.</p>

<p>"And yet, little woman, it is a tame, stereotyped
form of speech, that will make about as much impression
as a pancake would on a rock."</p>

<p>I laughed outright at the originality of his comparison.
"Laugh if you wish," he continued, "but
it is true. 'The agitation of thought' is far more
likely to prove 'the beginning of wisdom' than a

<!-- page 73 -->

blind 'fear of the Lord.' One of the draymen on the
street, or an angry ditcher, might swear to his heart's
content, and no one pays any particular attention, for
there is nothing in particular meant; but let Eben
Rockman call for God's curse upon a nation's sins,
and what a shock it creates! the mental atmosphere
is stirred all about him; and why?</p>

<p>"Simply because he means something. There is
intent, purpose, force, intelligence, behind it. It is a
breath from the flame of God Almighty's indignation."</p>

<p>"I gave up contending with you on that point
long since, uncle, and have nothing to say now, only,
do your own work your own way, as you will, no
matter what I might say; but I should like to know
what became of Widow Brown and her children."</p>

<p>"Ah, you would? Well, you have seen one of
them in the carpenter who sang</p>

<p class="small">'Woe to the man whose wealth proclaims<br/>

Another man's undoing!' "</p>

<p>"What, John Brown!" I exclaimed. "I thought
you called the woman Brown just for convenience.
I did not suppose it was her real name."</p>

<p>"And why should it not be as convenient for me to
call one by their right name as by any other, I should
like to know? Besides, a genuine surprise is a good,
healthy mental shock. You are quite a philosopher,
madam, but you have not learned it all yet."</p>

<p>"Are Blank and Ledger real names too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly they are <i>real</i> names; but they did not
exactly belong to the men I designated by their
use."</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"Your pun is lost, uncle, for I am not annoyed in
the least, not even a slight mental shock. Did you
learn what became of the rest of the family?&mdash;Browns,
I mean, not Blanks or Ledgers."</p>

<p>"I did," he replied, but said nothing further. I
waited a little, and then added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, please?"</p>

<p>"I did not learn it all from John, but enough so
that I could trace out the rest. Mrs. Brown caught
a heavy cold consequent on the overwork and anxiety
caused by moving; and this held her, in spite of
remedies, till it became a settled cough, ending in
the same disease of which her husband died,&mdash;a
lingering consumption,&mdash;which finally took her
hence. George, the eldest, became reckless through
strong drink and evil companions, into whose company
he was thrown by the change; and, of the
three girls, two of them, so I have learned from
Minnie, are in a house of prostitution. Mary, the
second girl, is married; but they are very poor, her
husband not being able to work near all the time;
and John you have seen."</p>

<p>"A sad conclusion, but are we sure that it would
have been better had they remained where they were?
All that you have named might have occurred, even
then," I said, not willing to look upon their misfortunes
as the legitimate outgrowth of the prosperity
of others.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he replied; "but Brown does not
think so; and suppose that Blank had acted the part
of a brother to 'Sister Brown,'&mdash;suppose he had
paid what was laid upon her in consequence of his

<!-- page 75 -->

efforts to add to the value of his own property.
Had he done this, instead of paying that extra hundred
toward building the church, she could have got
along for a while; and then, as the value of the
property increased, he could have aided her in selling
a portion of it, and have helped her to put the proceeds
to such use as would have enabled her to have
educated her children, and still retained a home.
Do you not believe that the genial influence of such
a course would have saved that family to have become
a blessing to the community?</p>

<p>"But he had the power to do otherwise, and so
he did it; and that is just what he ought to have
been deprived of. No government is a just one that
permits one man or class of men to grow rich upon
the necessities of another man or class of men. If
we had city mothers, as well as city fathers, I opine
that the poor would not be hedged around us as they
are now. In a case like that of Widow Brown's, the
power that decreed those improvements should have
seen to it that she sustained no loss thereby. City
fathers, indeed! such fathers ought to be accursed."</p>

<p>"But I cannot see the necessity," I said, "for
those girls becoming prostitutes because they were
poor: there is certainly work enough to be done to
give one an honest support in a country like this. I
know of any number of ladies who would count a
quiet, steady American girl a treasure; for they are
so annoyed with ignorant, inefficient help they hardly
know what to do at times."</p>

<p>"They have no business to be <i>ladies</i>: let them be
women,&mdash;true, whole-souled, helpful women; and

<!-- page 76 -->

then quiet, well-educated girls who chanced to be
poor would not shrink from taking a part of their
burdens; but, as it is now, it is about the worst
place that an intelligent girl can be put. They can
have no society, unless they accept that of the
coarse and ignorant who occupy the same sphere
that they do,&mdash;that of servants. If they can not do
this, then they are subject to all the annoyance that
ignorance and jealousy can inflict, this becoming
especially bitter if there chance to be one or more
of this class in the same house.</p>

<p>"The poor girl has no society, no sympathy, and
she is human. She is lovely, intelligent, refined;
often more so than the one who occupies the place
of mistress. The husband or sons can not fail to see
this, and speak kindly to her if at all; relieve her
of some burden, do her some favor, and in so respectful
a manner that she can no more put them
aside, than one famishing of thirst can dash a cup
of cold water to the ground. And step by step the
bonds of sympathy draw them toward each other;
no thought of evil on her part; on his, perhaps, and
perhaps not, oftener not: till, finally, they are borne
beyond the point of safety; to one, at least.</p>

<p>"O God! how I wish I could show up these
things as I see them! Our system of society makes
men what they are, makes women what they are:
and then we curse them, despise and curse ourselves.
Well does Scripture say, 'The creature was <i>made</i>
subject to vanity, <i>not willingly</i>.' We do not do as
we do willingly; we are urged on by an invisible
force, fate, devil, or whatever else you may choose

<!-- page 77 -->

to call it. In cases like these to which I have referred,
the woman tempts the man."</p>

<p>"Tempts the man! do you know what you are
saying, Mr. Rockman?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mr</i>. Rockman knows what he is saying perfectly
well. Does the parched, the thirsty earth tempt the
falling rain? does a vacuum tempt a fullness? I do
not say that there is an intelligent effort to tempt
the man; far from it: but her loneliness, her heart-hunger,
goes out in her magnetic sphere, and reaches
toward him as the plant turns from darkness toward
the sunlight. Oh this accursed spirit of caste, this
devil of the pride of position! Wealth sets a fool
on high: the want of it drags an angel down to the
ditch."</p>

<p>"All that you say is true," I answered, "but
where is the remedy? We must find and apply that,
or make the best of things as they are. There is not
much use in running into a hedge, if the only result
is to scratch ourselves."</p>

<p>"Of course not: it is easier to push others on."</p>

<p>"But why need we do that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If there is not room enough for all, how is it to
be helped. In the very efforts we make to keep off,
we push others on, and we can not avoid it."</p>

<p>"What can we do, then, uncle? tell me that."</p>

<p>"Tear down the hedge; burn it up; dig it out by
the roots; any way to get rid of it. But that will
never be done till people learn to look on both sides
of a thing. They think now that the Devil is just
the other side of the hedge, think the hedge is the
only thing that keeps his satanic majesty from having

<!-- page 78 -->

full sway among the human family. That crown
of thorns, it can't be spared; some one must wear
it to save the rest.</p>

<p>"If they would only look a little closer,&mdash;would
look on the other side,&mdash;they would find an angel
instead; would become so charmed, that the hedge
could not hold them back: they would break through
it, jump over, or crawl under. Those who cared
only for themselves would do one of the latter; but
those whose hearts burned with love for humanity
would bare their breasts to the thorns, and, pressing
forward, carry the hedge with them, that they might
make a breach through which others could follow.
And that is what the martyr heroes, the Christs of
the ages, have been doing."</p>

<p>After this outburst, we sat for some time in
silence. Finally he commenced again with, "Mankind
love the good, love to think they are doing
good: somewhere, in some shape, you will be sure to
find this desire manifest, if you will watch for it; if
they only knew how, they would love to make everybody
happy. Wellby enjoys the thought that he is
doing good with his money; but if he could only
comprehend the workings of the system which
makes him rich at the expense of others"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," I interrupted, "that you
have only given a portion of the other side to that
matter."</p>

<p>"Yes; have only told you how he came by his
money: the results of its use are yet to be given.
Well, we will look at the other side there, now. We
have already seen that he bought six city lots at a

<!-- page 79 -->

low price, and sold two of them, two years afterward,
for twice the sum that he paid for the whole six.
Now, what was the cause of this increase in value?
Improvements made in that vicinity; an increase of
business facilities. But did he do any thing toward
increasing that business? did he make any of those
improvements?</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor the other; and a large proportion
were made at the city's expense. Of this he paid
his proportion in tax; but the increase in value, to
the tax he paid, is as a thousand to one. Consequently
that widow who owned a little home, and
paid one-tenth as much of that tax as he did, did
one-tenth as much as he did toward that thousand
increase, and, when he sold those lots at such an
advance, had just as good a right to her proportion
of the increase as he had to the whole."</p>

<p>"Was not her property increased in value, as well
as his, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so far as the lot was concerned; but the
house was cheapened, made valueless, for it had become
out of place with its surroundings; and, if she
sold, it would be to some one who could and would
put up another house, moving that back for a stable,
or tearing it down: consequently she would be
likely to get only what the bare lot was worth, thus,
as I have said, making her house valueless.</p>

<p>"Neither would it be worth as much to <i>her</i> for a
home; because, her income not increasing, and her
taxes becoming higher on account of increased valuation,
she would find it more difficult to support herself
and children than before. So of that laboring

<!-- page 80 -->

man on the opposite corner. His garden will yield
no more than before; neither will his house hold any
more people. He gets no more for his work; but he,
too, must pay higher taxes on account of increased
valuation. But Wellby, or another who held vacant
lots, could sell them, and put the money at interest,
while every dollar thus obtained goes where he can
make it pay him, where it will coin other dollars to
gain still others, and so on.</p>

<p>"You see that property is valued according to
what use the rich can make of it, and not by what
the poor need, or can do; and the result is, that the
poor are forced by their necessities to aid in making
the rich richer, while they themselves are driven
into the highways and byways.</p>

<p>"John Brown is not able to own a house of his
own, and so he hires one of Jerome Smith; but Mr.
Smith has plenty of money, and he sees, that, by putting
up a block of new buildings, he can bring more
business into the neighborhood, and increase the
value of his property. He does not mind the increase
of the taxes, because he has the power to
make others pay them. How? do you ask? I will
tell you. He hires Brown to put up these buildings;
and when they are done he says, 'Mr. Brown, I shall
be obliged to raise your rent, for there is a demand
for house-room; and, besides, property has increased
in valuation, and my taxes will be higher. I must
make the place pay interest and taxes.'</p>

<p>"So he computes thus: 'The property is worth a
cool thousand more than it was;' and then he adds
the probable increase of taxes to the interest on a

<!-- page 81 -->

thousand, puts it into Brown's rent; and he must pay
it, or move elsewhere. John Brown's work has increased
the valuation of the house over his own head;
and John Brown must pay the bill, or go into less
respectable quarters. Oh! it is a splendid grinding-machine,
the present structure of society; and the
poor must not only turn the crank, but hold their
own noses to the grindstone.</p>

<p>"And yet Smith, Wellby, and others think they
are doing good with their money, <i>because</i> they furnish
poor people employment. Suppose I am hungry,
and see what will bring me bread, but am not
able to reach it. Well, here comes along another
hungry man, and I see that he can do what will
bring me that bread: so I say to him, 'I have some
bread out yonder, which, if you will bring me, I will
give you some of it.' Now, the bread does not belong
to me, any more than it does to him: only I claim it
by right of discovery. But he goes and gets it, and
of three loaves I give him half a loaf; and I boast of
the good I have done by giving that man work, and
keeping him from starving.</p>

<p>"Starving, indeed! did he not keep me from starving?
He knew not where to get bread, and I showed
him. I had not the strength to get it, and he got it
for me. We should both have starved without my
knowledge, and we should have both starved without
his strength; why, then, do I presume to deal out
his share, making it only one-fifth as large as mine?
An equal division would have been justice.</p>

<p>"This is Christianity, is it? this is the brotherhood
that Jesus taught? Not much!</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p>"Now, to show the other side of the workings of
this system which puts money into one man's pocket,
so that he can employ others and keep them from
starving,&mdash;to show up this system more fully, let us
take Wellby's case again; and perhaps we may learn
whether it is he, or some one else, that does this.</p>

<p>"If I remember rightly, it was two thousand dollars
that he sent West to draw twelve per cent interest.
Men of money, men of speculative powers, could use
money, and make it bring them as great a return as
this, or more; and so <i>fathers</i> of the State, or 'State
fathers,' made that rate legal. No 'State mothers,'
to care for the <i>little ones</i>, the poor.</p>

<p>"Well, 'little ones' try to do as the big ones do.
There is a man who has a piece of land that he is
told, and he believes, that it will become very valuable
if he can put certain improvements upon it. He
has a growing family, and he would like to shape
things so that they may have something to begin life
with; so he is persuaded to borrow two thousand,
and make the desired changes, or additions. His
eighty acres of land, for which he paid one hundred
dollars, is not worth half enough to secure this sum
on mortgage, not even with the five years' labor
that he has put upon it; but he is so bound to use
the money on the premises, that his farm is the forfeit
if he does not, and the men of money are safe."</p>

<p>"They look out for the safety of the dollar, I perceive,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! it is the nest-egg, upon which they
manage to set the geese that lay them golden ones;
<i>poor geese</i>! and they get plucked of their feathers in

<!-- page 83 -->

the end, to pay for the privilege. I am showing up
the workings of a civilization that calls itself 'Christian,'
remember."</p>

<p>"I shall not be very likely to forget it," I replied,
as some of my own bitter experiences flashed
across my mind; and he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But you see there is an agent in the case, and he
must live. He charges from two to five per cent for
doing the business, and that must be taken from the
two thousand; then there is the expense of the
mortgage, putting it on record, &amp;c.; so, by the
time the man gets the money, it is considerably
less than two thousand; but that is the sum upon
which he must pay interest. The lender gets the
benefit, and the borrower pays the bills.</p>

<p>"Now, when the improvements are made for which
what is left of the two thousand pays, the man has
put considerably more than that sum into them, for
his time, labor, &amp;c., have gone in also; and he gets
what? A business that will pay him just about as
much more than he could earn before as to enable
him to pay the two hundred and forty dollars
interest, and perhaps the additional tax that the
increased valuation of his property brings. Perhaps,
and perhaps not; all he gets, then, in return for all
this trouble and care, is the satisfaction of being
<i>counted</i> a wealthy man."</p>

<p>"A goose indeed!" was my audible thought.</p>

<p>"The world is full of them, child; but I have not
done with the results of the two thousand yet, as
seen from the other side than that which puts money
into Wellby's pocket, and enables him to do good.

<!-- page 84 -->

Every acre of land, within a mile each way from
where these improvements have been made, is counted
as worth at least a dollar more, more likely from
two to five more; and within a few weeks an Eastern
capitalist sells a piece of land in that vicinity for
three thousand dollars, for which, eighteen months
before, he paid only one thousand."</p>

<p>"The two thousand has gone back to Massachusetts,
to Boston, perhaps," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, or is expended where some one else will
make improvements, till it doubles or trebles itself
again; but the man's debt is not paid. Still he has
run the risk, been to the trouble of doing what has
put money into that other man's pocket; while the
other man has done nothing toward it. Justice
would have given at least a portion of that increase
to him, to aid in canceling that debt; but there is no
justice in the God-cursed system. Away with it
from the face of the earth!</p>

<p>"Wellby, however, gets his two hundred and forty
each year," continued Rockman, after taking time to
quiet down a little from his burst of indignation;
"for his money has made slaves of that Western
family, and they must furnish him with that sum, or
they lose their home. He thus has them by the
throat, you see; and it is 'your money, or your life.' "</p>

<p>"But there is one point you have not named even
yet. Uncle Rockman."</p>

<p>"And what is that, child?"</p>

<p>"The State gets a greater amount in taxes from
the increased valuation caused by the use of that
two thousand."</p>

<!-- page 85 -->

<p>"Yes, I spoke of increased taxes, little woman:
you forget."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, uncle; I do not forget. It is true
that you spoke of increased taxation in reference to
the people's pockets, but you said nothing of the
use made by the 'State fathers' of that money;
you failed to look on the other side."</p>

<p>"Oh! they increased their salaries on account of
their increased duties, I presume. As there were no
'State mothers' to do it for them without charge,
their washing bills would grow large; their spit-boxes
would have to be cleaned occasionally too;
much oftener than before <i>they</i> became a great State,
and had a great deal of company from abroad; gentlemen,
of course. These virtuous fathers would
never think of entertaining ladies."</p>

<p>"When did you take your last dose of wormwood,
Uncle Rockman, that you are so sarcastically
bitter?" I asked; for the sneering tone that he
used when in some of his moods annoyed me.</p>

<p>"The last time I was athirst. This sin-cursed
world has nothing but vinegar mingled with wormwood
and gall, to give to such as I.</p>

<p class="small">'Nothing but a manger,<br/>

Cursed sinners could afford,<br/>

To receive the heavenly stranger.' "</p>

<p>"But Jesus sweetened his with, 'Father, forgive
them,' you know."</p>

<p>"That is what we are told, madam: he sweetened
his in his way, and I must mine in my way. But we
have not done with Wellby yet."</p>

<!-- page 86 -->

<p>"And are not likely to be, it seems," said I laughingly.</p>

<p>"Not if you keep interrupting me, puss. Every
year he receives his two hundred and forty dollars,
and uses it in paying men for doing what will bring
him twice that sum. He is doing so much good
with his money, you know! Those men didn't do
him any good; oh, no! Why, they would starve if
he didn't furnish them with work!"</p>

<p>"You see, he doesn't look on the other side."</p>

<p>"Well, ten years have rolled away. The husband
and father has died with the two thousand unpaid,
the thought thereof imbittering his last moments.
True, Wellby has received two thousand four hundred;
but what of that? It has only been for the
use of the money: it is only the interest that he has
received; but he now needs the principal, and must
have it, for he sees a chance to do so much good
with it. The result is, the property must be sold.
When the two thousand is paid, together with the
expense attendant on forced sale, the widow and
children have about as much as they would have
had, had it been sold before the two thousand was
used upon it.</p>

<p>"Ten years of labor gone, and Wellby has had the
avails in that two thousand four hundred of interest-money.
For ten years, men East and men West
have worked for this man, he so managing that
those West paid those East; and neither have added
to their possessions, while he has been growing rich
all the time. Now, what would be justice between
them, in your estimation, madam?"</p>

<!-- page 87 -->

<p>"I can give you my estimate of it," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, if you please."</p>

<p>"All that Wellby has now, over and above what he
had ten years ago, should be divided between him
and those who have helped him to gain it. Fifty
thousand dollars, I think he said that his property is
worth now. Well, suppose that he was worth five
thousand then; and suppose that it has taken the
labor, the time, of eight men beside himself, to make
this increase; he having had his living for self and
family, and they theirs. Taking out his original five
thousand, we have forty-five thousand left; an equal
division of that would give him and them five thousand
each."</p>

<p>"And that is your idea of justice?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Why, woman! you have given capital no chance
whatever."</p>

<p>"I did not intend to, further than the chance of
keeping itself whole. Give us the same chance to
repair life's forces as they wear away, and we
should live forever. Death would be swallowed up
in victory, and immortality sure. Why should dead
matter, in the shape of capital, be permitted to
increase itself at the expense of human hearts and
brains, I would ask?"</p>

<p>"Well done! well done, little woman!" he exclaimed,
rising and walking rapidly back and forth;
"but we cannot spare you yet."</p>

<p>"And who talks of sparing me?"</p>

<p>He stopped in his walk, faced me a moment, and
answered, "You are so near the kingdom, that, if the

<!-- page 88 -->

gate should be left ajar, the draught might take you
in."</p>

<p>"And then I should know what was on the '<i>other
side</i>,' " said I quickly.</p>

<p>"There may be a possibility of seeing the 'other
side' of things too soon for our own good. I sometimes
think there is," was his thoughtful response.</p>

<p>"And there comes the 'other side' to this discussion;
or, rather, what will put an end to it," said I,
starting up as I saw a carriage stop at the door, and
a friend preparing to alight.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">OTHER POINTS.&mdash;A PROBLEM.</p>

</div>

<p>"I DO not exactly like the way the other
side of those questions was illustrated,"
I said to Rockman a few mornings after
we had been interrupted, as related in
the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>"Why? did I not compliment you highly enough?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! you know better. But it seems to me
that you took particular pains to bring out the very
darkest points, to cite extreme cases; and I think it
hardly fair. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Don't, now, appeal to my sense of justice, I
beg," said he in tones of mock distress; "besides,
it is 'not fair' to make a witness testify against
himself."</p>

<p>"Never mind your 'sense of justice:' waive that
in favor of gallantry, and answer my question,
please," I returned in the same strain.</p>

<p>"Well, if I must, I must. But I shall defend
myself. YES, I DO. I think it perfectly right to
match one extreme with another. It is the system
that I am showing up. It is the system which causes
men and women to make fools of themselves and one
another; hardening their hearts, and blinding their
eyes, by continually presenting to them false issues,
false hopes.

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"I do not like to make human beings look ugly;
but if there is something that is making them really
so, and its advocates show us what is good in us in
spite of that something, that system, claiming this
good to be the result of the system itself, have I not
the right to hold up the true results, and the worst
that can be found, in order to convince them of their
error?"</p>

<p>"But will it do that? Will they not see at once
that you have given extreme cases, the results of
individual folly perhaps, and thus just the opposite
effect from what you desire be produced?"</p>

<p>"So thought not the agitators of the slavery question:
they quoted the worst features, not because
they were everywhere true, but because they existed
under, were the legitimate fruits of, the system.
Many of our best people thought them too severe;
but they knew that it took Gabriel's trump to wake
the dead, and they could not be induced to blow
softly, even to save weak ears."</p>

<p>"Still I can not but feel, uncle, that those 'anti-slavery'
veterans made a mistake somewhere, somehow;
though I do not see clearly how."</p>

<p>"Well, I can," he said: "they condemned the
people with the system; they denounced the slave-holder
as the chief of all villains, as well as the system
as the sum of all villainies. They said, 'Stand by thyself:
I am holier than thou,' forgetting that we are all
sinners, that we have all come short of the perfect law.
People are conscious in their inner souls of a desire
to do right; and whatever of wrong they admit, they
justify by the force of circumstances, consequently
will not submit quietly to unqualified condemnation."</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p>"And that is where you think the mistake was?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," I said after a moment's
thought; "but it seems to me that people are so inclined
to identify themselves with that which they
advocate or sustain, that opposition thereto is considered
as opposition to themselves."</p>

<p>"Where, then, did the mistake come in?"</p>

<p>"I do not know: perhaps there was none."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he repeated: "Christians say that
there are no mistakes in God's perfect plan, and I
suppose that slavery comes in with the rest; but it
seems like blasphemy to admit it."</p>

<p>"If we go into the realm of the absolute, Uncle
Rockman, we are sure to get beyond our depth; let
us confine ourselves to facts and their relations.
You have owned that you have quoted extreme
cases to illustrate the workings of our present financial
system, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You mistake, child: it was you who accused me
of that, and I claimed that I had that right, neither
affirming nor denying as to the accusation."</p>

<p>"You said that you should defend yourself; and
what need of defense if there was nothing to defend?"</p>

<p>"The rights of the people, your rights; general
principles."</p>

<p>"But they are not yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! they are when they are represented in
me. You said it was not fair: I said that it was, and
thus defended myself in the right to do so if I chose;
and, in defending myself, defended you, should you
be placed in a similar position."</p>

<!-- page 92 -->

<p>"Thanks for your championship."</p>

<p>"Of truth," he interrupted.</p>

<p>"Well, I am truth when I represent it," I retorted,
using his own illustration against him; "so thanks for
your championship of myself; but did you not really
use extreme cases in illustrating the other side of
the results of Blank, Ledger, and Wellby's speculations?"</p>

<p>"If you mean beyond the medium, yes; if the very
worst, no. I have given extremes perhaps, as they
occur through the acts of people who have a desire
to be honest in their dealings one with another; such
as would not willingly injure any one; but 'business
is business, you know,' is their motto, and they obey
it. But there are those whose ruling love is money,
or, it may be, an ambition that money is needed to
carry out. Such will let nothing stand in their way:
the technicalities of the law itself are taken advantage
of, and the system can not prevent even this.
Here extreme cases come in; but I did not use them,
though I have known some such.</p>

<p>"Why? do you ask? Simply because they would
not have been the true opposite, the other side to the
characters I was dealing with. Blank and Ledger
were not bad-intentioned men; neither is Wellby.
On the contrary, they were and are good men, as the
world goes; as good, perhaps better, than the average;
consequently, are a fairer illustration of the workings
of a system which <i>must</i> change, pass away, to give
place to one more perfect."</p>

<p>"I wish that time would come," I said.</p>

<p>"But what shall take its place?" he asked with

<!-- page 93 -->

startling emphasis: "you can not answer, neither can
I; it is a problem that is yet to be solved."</p>

<p>"And, till it is, we must be content with what we
have, for any thing that I can see," I asserted in a
tone that showed a desire to close the discussion.</p>

<p>"Not content with, but as patient under it as is
consistent."</p>

<p>"A patience that will permit of cursing when one
feels like it," I retorted: "ha, ha, ha! you are a
pretty example of patience."</p>

<p>"Of course I am," he replied with the most imperturbable
coolness; "an emetic deliberately taken to
dislodge the contents of an overloaded stomach is no
sign of impatience; but it is a sign, is good evidence,
that the party is not content with his condition: so
I may be, am discontented; and cursing may help me
to bear, to make me patient, simply because of the
relief to overcharged nerves; do you comprehend?"</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"But you are tired of this, and are too polite to
say so in words, though your manner shows it plainly
enough: no, I am not offended; it is time I was
going. Good morning."</p>

<p>"Is there or was there ever another like him?"
was my involuntary comment as he closed the door
behind him. Then my mind reverted to the system
of society, to the methods of dealing one with another,
to the powers that be, and their natural resistance
to the changes, that I agreed with Rockman in
saying, must be made; and I cried out in an agony of
spirit,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is sufficient for these things?"</p>

<!-- page 94 -->

<p>Then there came to my mind the Rabbinical
legend of Sandalphon, the angel of prayer; and I
wondered if he was really gathering the prayers of
humanity, the heart-hungering prayers, that were
constantly going up for a better state of things.</p>

<p>If so, and they finally "change into flowers in his
hands," what a flowery future we have before us,
which will be ours <i>when we get to it!</i> But the, "How
long, O Lord, how long?" that we send up so often,
seems many times to be met too much as was the
darky's when overheard by his master,&mdash;</p>

<p>"As long as my whip-lash;" the weight of its swift
descent resting, at the same moment, upon the poor
fellow's back. Well, if "whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth," then we are all beloved; and if the
words of the Methodist hymn are true, "Through
tribulations deep, the way to glory lies," we shall be
likely to reach the glory some time; for the <i>deep</i> tribulation
comes to us all sooner or later.<p>

<p>The poet, after portraying the legend of Sandalphon,
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"It is but a legend, I know,&mdash;<br/>

A fable, a phantom, a show,<br/>

Of the ancient Rabbinical lore;<br/>

Yet the old medi&aelig;val tradition,<br/>

The beautiful, strange superstition,<br/>

But haunts me and holds me the more.</p>

<p>When I look from my window at night,<br/>

And the welkin above is all white,<br/>

All throbbing and panting with stars,<br/>

Among the majestic is standing<br/>

Sandalphon the angel, expanding<br/>

His pinions in nebulous bars.</p>

<!-- page 95 -->

<p>And the legend, I feel, is a part<br/>

Of the hunger and thirst of the heart,<br/>

Of the frenzy and fire of the brain,<br/>

That grasps at the fruitage forbidden.<br/>

The golden pomegranates of Eden,<br/>

To quiet its fever and pain."</p>

</div>

<p>Yes, that is it,&mdash;the true reason of our restlessness;
we are fevered with the results of false conditions;
fevered, and full of pain, our restless spirits
grasp hither and thither. Some look upward to the
stars, and pour forth their longings in language of
such plaintive eloquence, that I sometimes wonder if
the angels ever stoop to listen.</p>

<p>Still it is a feverish pleading, in which the true
and false are strangely mixed, in which realities and
shadows interchange and multiply each other.</p>

<p>Others, with different phases of this fever, this
heart, soul hunger, take to whiskey, tobacco, opium,
dress, style, fashion, politics, religion,&mdash;yes, religion;
for a fevered devotion is as common as any other
form of this disease. O God! how much gall and
wormwood will it take to cleanse and clear both
heart and brain?</p>

<p>Thus questioning and groaning in spirit, the
atmosphere of my room became too close for me, and
I went out into the sunlight. Brick walls all about
me, brick under my feet, and hard pebbles, threaded
with iron rails, over the entire street. I looked upward,
and the sky was as blue, as pure, as soft and
yielding, as though it was not made up, in part, with
emanations from brick that had been hardened by
man's invention, from iron that he had wrenched

<!-- page 96 -->

from its native ore, and from stone that he had
made to serve him.</p>

<p>"O man!" I said, "thou makest all things to serve
thee: why canst thou not solve this problem of the
ages? why canst thou not find that which will allay
thy fevered thirst?</p>

<p>"The churchman points me to Him who sat by the
well of Samaria, and talked of the living water, of
which if one drink, it shall be a well of water springing
up within him into everlasting life. But have
they received it? Do they not sicken and die like
others?"</p>

<p>On, on, through the busy streets, I pass as I thus
question, till at length my feet become weary with
pressing the unyielding pavement; and I take my seat
in the cars for the convenience of which those iron
rails separated the pebbles in the equally unyielding
street.</p>

<p>Passengers must get on and off; and we stop in
front of a vehicle from which two strong men are
lifting something. What is it?</p>

<p>Can it be possible? yes, it is a woman; in spite of
all her rags and dirt, I recognize the sad fact, that
soul-hunger, that the "fever and pain," have dragged
a woman down to this. Those strong men, some
woman's sons, were policemen; and the building into
which they were taking her was a police court.
Alas, my sister! unconscious, stupefied by the liquid
fire of man's invention, thou hast for the time forgotten
thy thirst, but only to awake with keener
gnawings.</p>

<p>But who is this sitting opposite me? his bloodshot

<!-- page 97 -->

eyes, his blistered face, his blossoming nose, all tell
the same tale, three witnesses testifying to his degradation;
but he is well dressed, and sits independently
erect. He has never been obliged to sell himself for
bread; he is a gentleman, of course he is; and yet his
magnetism would scorch a sensitive, a pure woman
like the flames of hell. No wonder that a woman
with a spark of the human still left in her takes to
alcoholic fires, if forced by conditions into such fires
as that.</p>

<p>But I pass on till at length the bit of nature
beautified by art, the park, meets my eye,&mdash;an oasis
amid a desert of brick and stone.</p>

<p>Thank heaven that the god Mammon can not rob
Nature of all of the love of her children! The good
mother still retains her hold, and so there is hope.</p>

<p>Here I took my seat, and watched the comers and
goers, studying the various characters as they passed
before me. Presently my attention was attracted by
the appearance of a tall, finely formed man, with jet
black wavy hair, and eyes to match, who stepped
quickly forward to meet one of the most lovely girls
that I had ever seen. She seemed to me like a gush
of sunshine and song pervading a bed of violets. She
blushed and smiled as the gentleman approached;
and then they walked slowly back and forth, his head
bent toward her the while, with a deferential air, as
he listened and talked.</p>

<p>I could see, both from her dress and manner, that
she was unaccustomed to city life; and the deference
paid her by the courtly man of the world evidently
charmed and bewildered her thoughtless little head.</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

<p>"Another victim!" "Who is she?" "Some one
ought to warn her," were the remarks that I heard
from those around me. Just then I saw Rockman
coming quickly toward me.</p>

<p>"Prepare for a scene," said he, as soon as he was
near enough to speak without the others hearing.</p>

<p>"What is coming?" said I, glancing toward the
couple who had just passed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is of them; Minnie has been defeated so
far in every movement that she has made to separate
them; and she feels that something must be done
soon, or it will be too late. Be prepared to act as
the occasion demands, for I never saw Minnie so
aroused: there she comes!"</p>

<p>I turned, and saw a lady approaching with a quick,
firm step, and the air of a princess. Was that Minnie
Morris? Was she an infamous woman? She went
up to the couple, threw back her veil, and confronted
them. Her face was as pale as it will ever be when
in her winding-sheet, but her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>The girl gave a frightened little scream, and
shrank closer to the man's side. "You here!" he
exclaimed turning pale, then flushing to an angry
red.</p>

<p>"I am here, and intend to save that child from
your hellish grasp, if it costs me my life."</p>

<p>"Begone, or I will call the police."</p>

<p>"If you dare, Henry Gould."</p>

<p>"I most certainly should, did you not wear a
woman's form; though there is not much womanhood
left, I should infer from the character you bear."</p>

<p>"Enough left to match all the manhood that is left

<!-- page 99 -->

of a dozen such as you; and much you care for a
woman's form, only so far as you can make it minister
to your demands," was her quick retort.</p>

<p>"Come away. Miss Leland: this is no place for
you," he said, attempting to pass. But the crowd
was too dense to make that an easy matter, and Minnie
had come prepared. Suddenly there stepped
forth a veiled form; and, dropping upon her knees in
front of the pair, she threw back her veil, and looked
Gould in the face; it was but a moment, till another
and then a third did the same thing. It was too
much; the man fled from the faces of his victims.</p>

<p>"Now you and your friend look after this sweet
child," said Minnie, turning to Rockman, "and I will
away to my own work." The others went their ways
also; but the poor child (she was but a child, not
more than sixteen) when she found that her "<i>hero</i>"
had fled and left her, fainted, and would have fallen
prostrate had not Rockman caught her.</p>

<p>"Poor lamb, poor lamb!" he murmured, as he
rested her head upon his breast, and chafed her
hands and temples.</p>

<p>"Who, what, what does this mean? my child, oh,
my child!" cried a middle-aged man, who had just
come up, starting forward as he beheld the fainting
girl.</p>

<p>"We have saved her," said Rockman, comprehending
the anguish of the question.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" and, tottering to a seat, he
extended his arms.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, and Minnie Morris," said Rockman,
placing his child therein; and when Violet

<!-- page 100 -->

opened her eyes, her head was resting upon her
father's breast.</p>

<p>"Violet," I repeated, as I heard the name, "my
comparison, my thought, was not out of place. She is
a violet in her sweet modesty, and a golden crowned
lily in her rare beauty."</p>

<p>It was her sweet, shrinking modesty, that had held
the destroyer back, even while it intensified his desire
to possess. He dare not move too fast, and thus
there had been time for Minnie to act; and faithfully
had she worked.</p>

<p>From the first moment she had set her eyes upon
the girl, she felt that the city was not her atmosphere,&mdash;that
she was marked for some one's victim,
but whose? To learn this, she must move cautiously.
She set her agents to work, Rockman with the rest,
and finally she learned the girl's name and home;
then her friends were warned; and the father set
forth to find the child that he had supposed, till a few
hours before, was safe with an aunt in an adjoining
State.</p>

<p>They had learned before Minnie's letter reached
them, that she was not, had not been, with her aunt,
and were in a state of the utmost consternation, when
they, through the efforts of one that the world called
infamous, found the clew that led to her restoration.</p>

<p>But things were taking such a shape, that Minnie
dared not wait the result of her letter, so resorted to
the method that we have related.</p>

<p>I had often heard Mr. Rockman speak of Minnie
Morris, had become interested in her, but had never
met her till now, and now had not even spoken with

<!-- page 101 -->

her; but a glance at her determined face, as she confronted
Gould, had bound me to her for ever. I cared
not what the world called her, my soul claimed her
as sister; and I no longer wondered that Jesus said
of such,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The publicans and harlots go into the kingdom
of heaven before you."</p>

<p>It would be needless to relate, even if a full account
could be given of, the steps that were taken, the
means used to draw Violet Leland from the protection
of her friends. We have seen that the plot was
defeated, and we rejoice together, my dear reader,&mdash;defeated
in this case; but, oh! of how many plots
that are laid, can this be said?</p>

<p>Is God partial? does he leave things to be directed
by chance? or what does it all mean?</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"God moves in a mysterious way,<br/>

His wonders to perform;<br/>

He plants his footsteps in the sea,<br/>

And rides upon the storm.</p>

<p>Blind unbelief is sure to err,<br/>

And scan his works in vain:<br/>

God is his own interpreter,<br/>

And he will make it plain."</p>

</div>

<p>So says the poet; and John the Revelator says that
the angel who stood with one foot on the sea and the
other upon the land sware that&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when
he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should
be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the
prophets."</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>And our hearts cry out, "Hasten the unfolding of
this mystery;" but, even as we thus ask, there cometh
to us the words of Jesus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye know not what ye ask."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">A SURPRISE.&mdash;FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.</p>

</div>

<p>I NOTICED, when describing the scene
in the park, that Rose was particularly
interested. Her color went and came;
and, as I neared the finale, her excitement
increased. When I concluded,
she drew a long breath, and left the room; and as I
passed her door, soon after, I heard her sobbing. I
asked no questions, but resolved to watch and wait;
for as I remembered how Rose looked when I knew
her, a happy school-girl, I fancied that I could trace
a resemblance between her and Violet Leland.</p>

<p>Mr. Leland remained in the city a few days, but
he did not lose sight of his daughter. With a
strange pertinacity, so it seemed to his friends, he
took her with him while he sought out Minnie
Morris, the three girls who had confronted Gould,
and, last of all, coming with Rockman to call upon
me.</p>

<p>"I will risk Violet's coming to any harm by going
where her father goes, and listening to what he
hears," he said. "Had my girl been better informed,
she could never have been drawn so near to the
precipice."</p>

<p>I had said nothing of my suspicions to any one;

<!-- page 104 -->

but, when I saw them coming, I sent Rose to my
closet for an article that I could have done without,
but which I took a notion to have just then. I did
this to have her as far from the door as possible.</p>

<p>"I have brought Mr. Leland and his daughter,"
said Rockman, leading the way, "as they wished to
see you before they left the city."</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you," said I, extending my
hand; "and allow me to introduce my friend Miss
Barron," turning quickly toward Rose, who had
started to leave the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Leland looked up with a start, as I pronounced
the name; then, getting a full view of her
face, he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do the dead come to life? Rose, O Rose! what
does this mean?"</p>

<p>Rose managed to say "Uncle," but was too much
overcome to add any thing more; and I replied for
her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It means, Mr. Leland, that the lamb can be saved
out of the den of the wolf, as well as prevented
from going in."</p>

<p>Violet looked from one to the other with a puzzled
expression upon her face: "I should say it was
Cousin Rose, only I thought she was dead."</p>

<p>"And so I was, to all intents and purposes; oh!
why have you come to drag me out before the
world again?" sobbed Rose.</p>

<p>"But why do this, Rose? why leave us to think
you were dead? who wrote that letter telling us that
you had fallen into the sea, and that your body had
never been found?" asked Mr. Leland.</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

<p>"I wrote it, uncle; I thought my friends would
feel better thinking so, than to know the truth;" and
then, "oh, my poor mother! how is she?"</p>

<p>But I will pass over the next half-hour, in which
something of what Rose had suffered was told to her
rejoicing yet sorrowing relatives.</p>

<p>Still the worst was kept back to be told by Rockman
afterward.</p>

<p>"And this is what I have been saved from,"
sobbed Violet. "How much I have learned within a
few days! I feel as though I was ten years older."</p>

<p>"It is a terrible awakening, my child," said Mr.
Leland; "but the lesson learned has not cost us too
dearly."</p>

<p>Mr. Leland tried hard to induce Rose to accompany
him home, Violet joining in the request.</p>

<p>"I can not, I can not," was her only reply.</p>

<p>"What shall I tell your mother, then?" he asked,
when he found that his pleading was useless.</p>

<p>"I would rather that she would continue to think
me dead," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But I can not allow that, my child; for I know
that she would give all she possesses to look upon
your face once more."</p>

<p>Rose opened her lips as if to speak, and then
closed them again.</p>

<p>"What is it, my child?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of what I have heard her say,
but no matter; say to her what you please. If she
wishes to come here, I will see her; but I can not go
there."</p>

<p>I had tried several times to learn of Rose where

<!-- page 106 -->

her friends resided, but could get nothing from her.
When she attended my school she was boarding with
a distant relative, a maiden lady who had since died:
and so I had no clew whatever. But that which I
had sought to do was at length brought about without
my aid, and she was restored to her friends, at
least so far as the knowledge of her whereabouts was
concerned.</p>

<p>A few weeks afterward, a pale, sorrowful-looking,
elderly lady rang the bell, and asked for me. I
knew, as soon as I looked into her face, who it was
that stood before me; and, quietly leading the way,
I rapped at the door of Rose's room. She came and
opened it; and I left them standing face to face.</p>

<p>What transpired between mother and child, the
next few hours, none but God and attending angels
know; but, when they came down to tea, Rose wore
a look of subdued happiness such as I had never seen
upon her face before; while every line of the mother's
features said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This my child was dead, and is alive; was lost,
and is found."</p>

<p>But no word of pleading could induce Rose to
return with her mother: "I can not, I can not," was
still her cry. After her mother had left, I tried by
gradual efforts to bring her out from her seclusion,
to mingle in that society of which she was so well
fitted to form a part. She resisted my efforts, and
finally turned upon me one day with, "I will go
where you will never hear from me again, if you will
not leave me in peace."</p>

<p>"But why will you persist in throwing your life
away?" I asked.</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p>"I am not throwing it away," she replied. "It
has been taken from me, and I can not bring it back.
Do you suppose, with the wrongs I have endured
for ever haunting me, that I can go out and face the
world?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and show that you are greater than that
world by looking it in the face, and defying its injustice.
I know, Rose, that you have suffered terribly:
I have waited, giving you time to gather
strength, still hoping, expecting, that you would yet
become a worker in</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'The cause that lacks assistance,'</p>

</div>

<p>against</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'The wrong that needs resistance.'</p>

</div>

<p>Tell me, have I hoped in vain?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my kind, my best of friends, do not, do not
press me so hardly!" she exclaimed, sobbing as if
her heart would break.</p>

<p>My heart bled for her; but I knew that she must
be aroused, so I continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you allow the only benefit that can be gathered
from your sufferings to escape you for want of
courage to use the opportunity thus afforded you?
It seems to me that it has cost too much to have it
thrown away."</p>

<p>She gave me a startled look. "What do you
mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I mean this: you have not sinned, but have been
sinned against. You have been crucified, have worn
the crown of thorns, drinked the wormwood and the

<!-- page 108 -->

gall, and you have lain in the grave of inaction, of
forgetfulness; but has it not been long enough? I
know that it is hewn out of a rock, that it is well
guarded; but let the angel of determination come
to your rescue, and the keepers will begin to quake
before you. I mean, Rose Barron, that you are
greater than all you have suffered, greater than all
that opposes, if you will only think so."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" she asked, in a way that
showed me I was making an impression.</p>

<p>"I will find enough for you to do, if you will only
do it; but the first thing necessary is to look yourself
squarely in the face without blushing; in other
words, assert your self-respect. Why, even Minnie
Morris, in saving others, will yet save herself; for
their loving magnetism will bear her upward, whether
she will or no."</p>

<p>"Yes, Minnie is doing a good work; but I wish
she would leave the business she is in," was her
reply, after a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"From the world's standpoint, it might seem
better; but I am not so sure that it would be."</p>

<p>Rose looked at me with so much astonishment
depicted upon her countenance, that I laughed
heartily, in spite of my efforts to the contrary.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, dear: I am not advocating
prostitution," I said, as soon as I could speak. "But
Minnie's life is under her own control where she is,
as much as though she was in some other business;
and perhaps more so, for she has the means to be
independent. True, she boards those whose lives
are not what we could wish; but the merchant, the

<!-- page 109 -->

lawyer, the dressmaker, and all others, are just as
ready to take their money in payment of dues, as
she is for their board; at an exorbitant price, you
may say, but not in proportion to the risk. Society,
though ever ready to take their money, would push
them out of existence if it could.</p>

<p>"If they should go to church, as they often do,
and, when the contribution-box was passed, should
put in a five or a ten dollar bill, the minister will be
just as glad to get it, as he would have been had it
been paid first to the deacon for goods, and then
passed into the box for his use."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you think Minnie can
do more good where she is than elsewhere?" asked
Rose.</p>

<p>"I mean to say that she can if she will; that she
has greater opportunities. She has access now to
those that she could not reach, were she to try to
work with such as call themselves Christians. Beside,
if she were to attempt to join with that class
of people, she would have to conform to their ideas
of things, or she would not be accepted; and even
then she would be expected to take a back seat, and
Minnie will never do that.</p>

<p>"Many a one who would otherwise be efficient
workers are kept back by the Pharisaical, 'Stand by
thyself: I am holier than thou,' pride of those who
take the lead in benevolent enterprises and works of
charity; and, where she now is, Minnie is not limited
by long faces or mock prayers; so she can do her
own work in her own way, and saves more young
girls from destruction in one year than any half-dozen

<!-- page 110 -->

church-members in the city do in twice that
length of time. True, her good is not unmixed;
but whose is?"</p>

<p>I waited for some further response from Rose, but
she made none. She seemed in deep thought; and I
left her, praying that she might yet learn that&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Heaven has its own peculiar way<br/>

Of making angels out of clay;<br/>

And deep the chiselings of God,<br/>

That mold a seraph from the sod."</p>

<p>The next morning Rose came down to breakfast
as usual, but her face wore the same thoughtful look
as when I left her on the night previous: her manner
was quiet and subdued, but it lacked the give-up,
the helpless element that had so long pervaded
it. Toward night she came to me with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not know as I quite understood you last
night; but it seems to me you intended to say, that, if
we were lost to the world, we should find ourselves."</p>

<p>"That is just what I meant, but you have said it
better than I did," I replied, more pleased than I
chose to show.</p>

<p>"And, when we have thus found our real selves,
that we should do what we can in our own way,
regardless of what the world that had cast us out
might say, our acts being subject only to the
approval of God and our own souls?" she continued.</p>

<p>"Yes: that is, we must not <i>seek</i> the approval of
the world; but, if our line of duty lies where it
comes without seeking, then we need not go out of
our way to provoke martyrdom."</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<p>"Well, I do not know as I crave martyrdom," she
said, "but I do not feel as though I desired the
world's approval; I should fear that I was not
wholly unselfish; beside, I see so much that is false,
that I think I should prefer its frowns to its smiles.
I had hoped to remain quiet, and provoke neither;
but I find that it is not to be."</p>

<p>I waited, expecting to hear some definite decision,
some expression of purpose as to what she intended;
but she did not seem inclined to converse further,
and I would not question. I knew that time was
the best developer in her case, and I was content to
abide the result.</p>

<p>The next day, as she came down dressed to go
out, she put her hand upon mine, looked into my
face, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whatever you hear, whatever you see, trust me."</p>

<p>"Yes, and bless you too!" I replied, pressing a kiss
upon her sweet lips.</p>

<p>"Thank you," and she was gone. She did not
return till in the evening, and then Rockman came
with her. She said nothing, neither did I. This
was repeated some three or four times within the
next two weeks, till at length I remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you two engaged in a conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Rose; and Rockman added,
"Where ignorance is best, 'tis folly to be wise."</p>

<p>"You are not good at quoting, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I am; for I know just how to bend the
quotation to suit the case. Ignorance is not bliss for
you or any other child of Eve; for you all want to
know all that is going on."</p>

<!-- page 112 -->

<p>"Well, I do not seem very likely to find out," I
retorted, assuming an injured look.</p>

<p>"Now, don't, or I shall cry; don't, please, be
angry with me," said Rose, with mock terror
depicted upon her countenance.</p>

<p>"Come, little girls, don't waste your time in trying
to be actresses; for you will never succeed,
though you might become good at caricature."</p>

<p>"Now, Uncle Eben, that is too bad!" we both
exclaimed at once; but his only response was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's the truth."</p>

<p>About a week after this. Rose said, on going out,
"Do not be alarmed if I do not return to-night."</p>

<p>I wondered what it all meant, but felt certain that
there was nothing wrong, so simply bowed in assent.</p>

<p>The next morning about ten o'clock the bell rang;
and a lad, apparently about fifteen years of age, presented
a note, saying that it was from Miss Morris,
and with a bow retired.</p>

<p>"No answer is needed, it seems," I said to myself
as the boy left, and then proceeded to read the note,
which ran thus: "Do not be uneasy about Rose: she
is under my care, and I would protect her with my
life if necessary. Your friend,</p>

<p>"MINNIE MORRIS.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;How do you like the looks of my errand-boy?"</p>

<p>I had no anxiety about Rose, but the postscript
puzzled me. It made me keep thinking of the boy;
and somehow I fancied that I had seen that face
before, or one very much like it. But, the more I

<!-- page 113 -->

thought, the more I couldn't tell where or when, so
the more I was puzzled.</p>

<p>Another night passed, and Rose did not return.
The next morning, about the same hour, another
note was brought; but this time the bearer was a
middle-aged man of dignified appearance and gentlemanly
bearing, and the postscript read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you like the looks of my <i>particular</i>
friend, or, in other words, lover?"</p>

<p>This, as before, had the effect to keep me thinking
of the bearer; and the same haunting resemblance
to some one I had seen, that had troubled me
in reference to the boy, existed in this case also. In
the afternoon Rockman called, and I related these
facts to him.</p>

<p>There came a look over his face that was like a
flash, gone before you have caught it, and yet saying
so much. That look told me that he understood the
mystery, and yet told me so indistinctly that I was
not quite sure that I had read aright.</p>

<p>He laughed, and remarked, "You women are
always imagining something. I presume that you
have met them on the street."</p>

<p>"And you men are always doing something to
make us imagine," was my retort.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said he, "how much of your doings
would you like to have us shoulder, I should be glad
to be informed? It seems to me that in this case it
is women who are doing,&mdash;Minnie and Rose, for
instance; while the third one can only imagine, and
so is troubled. Poor puss wants a corner. That's
what's the matter."</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>"Well, there should be four corners, uncle; and
if Rose, Minnie, and yourself occupy but three, why
should I not have the other?"</p>

<p>"You mistake, child: it is Rose, Minnie, and her
errand-bearers, the boy and the lover, who occupy
the corners."</p>

<p>"And yourself left out also. Well, I must say
that it is too bad. Still you are such a philosopher,
I suppose that you can endure it; but what can I
do?"</p>

<p>He smiled at my nonsense, and replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prepare for denouements."</p>

<p>"There is something at the bottom of all this that I
intend to find out," said I, noticing his peculiar tone.</p>

<p>"Of course you will; when a woman says she
will, she will, you may depend upon it;" and then,
rising to his feet, he added, "The atmosphere of a
curious, inquisitive, dissatisfied woman does not
exactly suit me: so I will bid you good afternoon,
madam."</p>

<p>"Cowards always run when the battle gets too
hot for their liking," I flung after him as he closed
the door, and then I sat down to think. But I must
confess that, in this case, thinking did not give me
any light. The next morning the boy brought a
third note, saying that Rose would be back that
evening; and, as I looked into his face, the truth
flashed upon me.</p>

<p>"Rose," I exclaimed, "what masquerading is
this?"</p>

<p>"Don't," said she, casting a quick, apprehensive
glance around: "no one must know but yourself;
take me to your room, and I will explain."</p>

<!-- page 115 -->

<p>I took her to her own room, and, closing and locking
the door, pointed to her closet. "Go and change
your dress," said I, "that I may know it is really
you; but, how you are going to be yourself without
your curls, is more than I can understand."</p>

<p>She laughed, and, taking a package from her
pocket, tossed it to me with, "Undo and brush
them, while I do as you have so peremptorily
demanded."</p>

<p>I undid the package; and there was her own beautiful
hair, and so fitted to her head that when
adjusted one would not know, without looking
closely, that it had ever been cut off. She was soon
arrayed in one of her becoming dresses; and, with
the hair in its old place, she was again my own sweet
Rose.</p>

<p>"I can not realize it," I said: "you look so differently
from what you did a half-hour since!"</p>

<p>"Many things are hard to realize, that are nevertheless
true," she replied in a tone of such serious
gravity, that I was again astonished. How many
transformations was my little Rose to pass through?</p>

<p>"I begin to think," she continued, "that the whole
world is two-sided; and we judge of those with whom
we come in contact by the side that is turned toward
us."</p>

<p>"Have you been with Minnie all this time?" I
asked, beginning to be anxious to get at the bottom
of her plans.</p>

<p>"I have: Minnie and I have a common bond of
sympathy. We have both suffered from one man's
perfidy; and, would you believe it, I saw him there."</p>

<p>"Is it possible, Rose!"</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p>"It is not only possible, but true; and he patted
Minnie on the back, saying that she was a trump,
had too good sense to go moping around because a
fellow happened to be changeable, and so spoil the
rest of her life.</p>

<p>" 'Spare your compliments, if you please, Mr.
Crandall,' was her quiet reply; but I saw the fire
flash from her eye in a way that boded him no good.</p>

<p>" 'Well, Minn, it was your own fault, after all: your
temper drove me from you, or I presume I should
have been faithful yet.'</p>

<p>" 'Miss Morris, if you please,' she said, drawing
herself up proudly.</p>

<p>" 'None of your airs with me, miss: they won't go
down.' "</p>

<p>"But where were you, Rose?" I asked, interrupting
her.</p>

<p>"Oh! I was Miss Morris's little waiter, and no one
paid any attention to me; that is, only once, when a
gentleman who seemed a little the worse for liquor
commenced talking to me."</p>

<p>"Were you not frightened?"</p>

<p>"Just a little startled; but Minnie's stern, 'Let
my servants alone, if you please,' put a stop to
any thing further in that direction. But I have not
done with Robert Crandall yet. Minnie turned upon
him with, 'Where is Rose Barron, Mr. Crandall?'</p>

<p>"Had a clap of thunder burst upon him from a
clear sky, he could not have been more startled.
'Why, what, what do you know of her?' he
asked.</p>

<p>" 'I know the history of that transaction, and that
is enough for you, sir,' was the prompt reply.</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>"Robert was silent for some moments. Minnie had
said to me, pointing to a chair a little back of where
she was standing, 'Sit down and rest you, Henry: I
shall want you presently.' I knew that she did it
to give me an excuse for staying, so I took the seat
indicated.</p>

<p>"I watched and listened, without seeming to do so;
and Robert, judging from his looks, was trying to
decide what course to take to disarm Minnie of
whatever feeling she might have toward him on
account of his treatment of me.</p>

<p>"At length he said, 'Well, Minnie, I must confess
that was the very meanest thing I ever did; I have
been sorry ever since, indeed I have; but your
temper drove me from you, and her beauty and her
prudery made me wild. Where is the girl? do you
know?'

<p>" 'I do, but you can not find her;' and then, looking
him full in the face, 'you say that you are sorry.
Prove it.'</p>

<p>" 'How?'</p>

<p>" 'I will tell you,' she answered. 'You wronged
that girl beyond the power of language to express;
you are a wealthy man in and of yourself, and, more
than that, have married a rich wife: you have plenty,
Rose is poor; put a thousand dollars into my hands
for her use, and I will believe what you say."</p>

<p>" 'But how am I to know that she gets it? I have
only your word.'</p>

<p>" 'And that is the word of one who has never told
you an untruth,' she replied proudly.</p>

<p>" 'Pshaw, the word of a '&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 118 -->

<p>" 'Stop,' said she in a tone of command: 'Henry,'
turning to me, 'show the gentleman out.'</p>

<p>"I do not think I could have walked to the door
but for the look she gave me,&mdash;a look which said,
'You are the one to do this. It is justice.'</p>

<p>"When he had gone, she sat down and laughed till
the tears rolled down her cheeks, and then, catching
me in her arms, exclaimed, 'Well, this is turning the
tables, isn't it? Woman is not helpless, if she only
knew her power; but, by holding us up to our own
contempt, they take that power from us.</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' she continued, 'if woman only knew her
power! Why, if I could get all who occupy a position
of shame in this city, if I could get them all
to feel as I do, we would turn things bottom side up,
and for the better too. We would have justice, and
no real harm can come from rendering justice to
the wronged.'</p>

<p>"I tell you she looked like a queen, when she
said it," said Rose, her eyes kindling as she told
me all this.</p>

<p>"But who is Minnie's lover?" I asked: "is he
another disguise?"</p>

<p>"Minnie's lover? I have seen none," she said
wonderingly.</p>

<p>I began to suspect who it was, and said, "We
will go down now: I see Mr. Rockman coming."</p>

<p>"And so you have got Rose back," was his first
remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, and I have found the boy who brought
the note. Do you think I shall succeed as well in
learning who the lover is?"</p>

<!-- page 119 -->

<p>"Perhaps: was he any thing like this?" taking a
wig and false whiskers from his pocket.</p>

<p>"You, too," said Rose starting forward; while I
said, "I can not tell, sir, till I see them on."</p>

<p>I could not imagine how he was going to do this
with the hair and whiskers he had; but he did, and
in such a manner that his own were entirely hidden,
or only appeared as a slight sprinkling of gray mingling
with the glossy brown.</p>

<p>Rose fairly shrieked with laughter. "And you
are the gentleman who came in soon after I shut the
door on Robert Crandall," she said, as soon as she
could speak.</p>

<p>"I was told that Crandall had been there," he
replied demurely; while Rose continued, "I thought
it such a pity that so pleasant, kind-looking a gentleman
should visit such a place! And I wondered if
he had a wife, mother, or sisters, and how they would
feel if they knew it."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! you did, puss; and what were you doing
there?"</p>

<p>"Watching you, sir, and others, gathering information
to serve me in the future," she replied.</p>

<p>"There as the friend, and under the protection,
of the mistress of the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, make the world believe that you was there
for any but an evil purpose, if you can."</p>

<p>"I shall not try, my friend," she said as the tears
came to her eyes. "I care but little now what the
world thinks: if I can only win the approval of my
own soul by helping to save some poor girl from
suffering as I have done, I shall be content."</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>"You may be content with that," he said; "but I
shall never be satisfied till I have found means to
remove the causes that produce such results."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, in doing my work, I may learn something
that will aid you in what you wish to do; at
least, I shall keep my eyes and ears open, and my
brain thinking, Uncle Rockman."</p>

<p>"I do not undervalue your work, little girl, and
shall often be near when you little think it, to aid
you, if need be; but when, oh! when, shall the
problem be solved, the mystery finished, and this
double dealing cease?" he exclaimed; and a far-off,
prophetic look came into his eyes, as he laid his hand
upon Rose's head, and added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, keep eyes and ears and heart open; not only
to what you see around you, but don't forget to look
heavenward, for from thence must come your
strength. My child, God help you! Amen."</p>

<p>"Amen," we both responded, and from earnest
hearts; then there fell upon us the cooling dew of a
silence, such as those experience who come into converse
with their inner selves.</p>

<p>"Why can not we hear God's voice now?" asked
one who had been reading the Bible account of those
who talked with him of old.</p>

<p>"And so we could, if we could get still enough,"
was the reply.</p>

<p class="small">"Louder than ten thousand thunders<br/>

Is the <i>silent</i> voice of God;<br/>

Wonderful above all wonders,<br/>

Coming from his blest abode;<br/>

<!-- page 121 -->

While my heart to him is praying<br/>

In a sweet rapportal kiss,<br/>

Up in heaven I hear him saying,<br/>

Trancing all my soul in bliss,<br/>

Come up hither, come up hither."</p>

<p>It is ever thus: in our calm, silent blendings with
the unseen, we must gather the strength that will
be our sheet-anchor in the hour of trial, the strength
that will enable us to ascend to the heights that are
above the storm-cloud.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">CHANGED.&mdash;TREASONABLE DESIGNS.</p>

</div>

<p>"IT seems to me that you have changed
wonderfully since I first met you, Mr.
Rockman," I said to him a few days
after the occurrence related in the last
chapter.</p>

<p>"Why do you think that? Is it because I allow
you to have your own way, and put a handle to my
name when you choose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! that is because you have grown lazy, sir, and
do not wish to take the trouble to correct me so
often."</p>

<p>"Not so very often, madam; for you do not do it
only when you forget yourself; but perhaps I am
yielding somewhat to the friction of life,&mdash;smoothing
off a little. Do you like me any the better for it?"</p>

<p>"I can not say that I do, sir. Indeed, I miss those
startling speeches, and feel as though I had lost
something."</p>

<p>"So you prefer lightning let loose to lightning
harnessed," he said, with one of his old flashes.</p>

<p>"Lightning let loose," I repeated, not exactly understanding
what he meant.</p>

<p>"Yes, lightning let loose darts along the blackened
cloud in zigzag lines of brightness, dazzling the eyes

<!-- page 123 -->

with its intensity; but it may prove very destructive,
and it will do no good to dodge, for you can have no
idea of where it will hit. Lightning harnessed loses
this brilliant flash, but follows the track of the wire
with unerring certainty; still, if designed for that
purpose, may be far more destructive than before."</p>

<p>"Oh! you think it is the brightness, the flash, that
I miss," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, is it not?"</p>

<p>"I had not thought what it was; but there is certainly
an exhilaration about a thunderstorm that the
telegraphic wire can not give,&mdash;to me, at least."</p>

<p>He looked at me and smiled, repeating, after a
moment,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"But whether good, or whether bad,<br/>

Depends on how you take it."</p>

</div>

<p>"The application, if you please?" said I.</p>

<p>"Depends upon how you stand related to it, would
have been better; for, if you are waiting a dispatch
that may bring you a message of life or death, I think
the excitement would be as great, and the interest
more intense, than could be produced by any ordinary
storm, even though</p>

<p class="small">"The lightning's flash, and the thunder's roll,<br/>

Were seen and felt from pole to pole."</p>

<p>"But will you give me the particular application
of all this to the change in your character?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No change of character, my child; iron is iron,
whether liquid in the furnace, or molded into vessels
of use. When 'God damn this thievish Christian

<!-- page 124 -->

nation,' burst from my lips, it was the flash of
the lightning from the overcharged cloud. I mingled
with the world, and looked upon wrongs that I could
not redress, till my soul was stirred to a fever heat, and
must find vent in some manner; so, being deeply
religious by nature, my indignation took the form of
an appeal to God for his curse upon such a state of
things. Before people understood the use of lightning-rods,
when the storm came, they made the unspoken,
if not spoken prayer for God's intervention
in their behalf; but now their prayers take an entirely
different form, that of practical work to the
same end. As I walked in and out among the people
an unseen presence went with me, and was ever
whispering, 'Come up to the help of the Lord against
the mighty.'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An unseen presence, Mr. Rockman?" said Rose.</p>

<p class="small">" 'Yes, unseen, but still believe me,<br/>

Such a guide my steps attend.'</p>

<p>"Thus I used to sing when I preached for the
Methodists. I believed it then; I know it now."</p>

<p>"You know it now! pray tell us how?" we both
exclaimed, almost in the same breath.</p>

<p>He sat a moment in silence. "I can not," he said,
at length: "my experience would be no evidence to
you; you must learn for yourselves; but I have
found that there is more than one mount of transfiguration,
and more than Moses and Elias, of those
who have gone before, who walk by our sides, and
give us of their aid."</p>

<p>The solemnity of his manner awed us, and we tried

<!-- page 125 -->

to shake off its influence by calling him a Spiritualist;
but he only replied, "Yes, such a Spiritualist as
Jesus was; we are of the same family, only he is a
few years older."</p>

<p>"How can you?" said Rose, her reverence being
shocked, in spite of her appreciation of his genuine
goodness.</p>

<p>"How can I speak thus of my brother? Why not?
He called himself our brother, and have I not a right
to take him at his word? I tell you we put him too
far off,&mdash;hold him at arm's length, instead of close
to our hearts. He is not far away, or his words are
not correctly reported; for he said, 'If I go, I will
come again;' and, 'Lo, I am with you alway, even
to the end of the world.' "</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Yes, unseen, but still believe me."</p>

</div>

<p>"Now, if Jesus is here, he is here for a purpose;
and he must have agents, both in the seen and in the
unseen, to aid in carrying out that purpose; and why
not use me as well as another?</p>

<p>"But a purpose indicates a plan," he continued.
"Electricity in the overcharged cloud is a force;
obedient to the law of the wire it is a power."</p>

<p>"Where is the difference between power and
force?" I asked. "If I force this window open, it is
because I have the power to do it."</p>

<p>"True. But if you know how to undo the fastenings,
you have the power to open it with a much less
expenditure of force, of strength."</p>

<p>"I see," I said, and then waited for him to go on
with his illustrations.</p>

<!-- page 126 -->

<p>"As I was saying," he resumed, "a purpose indicates
a plan. But the wages of sin is death; sin is
the transgression of the law, a lack of coming up to
its requirements. A perfect thing can not die; is not,
can not be, condemned, damned. We have not now,
have never had, a perfect form of society; no part of
it is, or has been, constructed according to the perfect
law: consequently, it is God-damned, or damned,
condemned of God.</p>

<p>"To have it otherwise would be the most terrible
thing that could be possible. What! God sanctioning,
accepting, approving an imperfect thing, in the
final sense of that term! He may approve <i>as an experiment</i>,
may bless us in the experiment; but we
must not expect to be left alone with the results of
such experiment till that which is perfect is reached.
As a nation, we are an experiment, and a grand one;
in that sense the blessing of the Almighty has rested
upon us in a wonderful manner.</p>

<p>"But the experiment is a failure, full of good
points, but still a failure; and when I call upon God
to damn, condemn, cast it aside, that a more perfect
may take its place, I am really calling for his
blessing."</p>

<p>"O Mr. Rockman, what a thinker you are!" said
Rose, drawing a long breath, as though she felt a relief
in thus giving a partial expression to the intense
feeling stirred within her; while my thought was,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Prophet of God, go on!"</p>

</div>

<p>"A perfect life, The Perfect Good, or God, smiles
upon an imperfect thing or good, only so long as it

<!-- page 127 -->

strives to attain to the perfect, reaches higher and yet
higher, cries out after the good, the God," said he in
continuation. "The purpose of our brother Jesus in
remaining with us, as I understand it, is the bringing
about of a perfect government, a perfect order of
society; and he is planning to that end.</p>

<p>"But we must work out our own salvation; for
it is God, the good in us, that both wills and does,
while our forces must be so directed as to become the
power of God, of our good, unto salvation. Well,
our brother Jesus, or some other brother of the unseen
realm, finds in me a great deal of that element
which, under certain conditions, becomes sheet or
chain lightning. It is a good, though evil-spoken of
while in that form.</p>

<p>"Some messenger sent from God, or the inner good
of his own being, becomes a Franklin to me, takes
Minnie as the kite, uses you and Rose here for tail,
and, drawing the force of this lightning from the
dark cloud of my ignorance, sets me to organizing it
as a power with which to execute the before-uttered
curse.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going deliberately to work; first, to
find where the imperfection lies, in society and in
government; then I shall plan for their overthrow,
and the inauguration of a higher."</p>

<p>"Treason," said Rose, half in sport and half in
earnest.</p>

<p>"You have undertaken a mighty work, call it treason
or what you will," I added.</p>

<p>"The work that my Father hath given me, shall I
not do it? beside, I am only opening the way, am the

<!-- page 128 -->

voice of one crying in the wilderness. Woman must
eventually lift up her own banner, she must be free,
ere she can bring forth the power to bruise the serpent's
head. 'The son of the bond-woman' <i>can not</i>,
instead of shall not, be heir with the son of the free-woman.</p>

<p>"Society, government, is to-day the child of the
bond-woman, and as such must be cast out. Woman
everywhere is in bondage, is not accorded equal
rights with man, has not the right even to the use
of her maternal functions unless <i>bound</i> to some man.
A <i>bound</i>-woman, how can she become the mother of
the sons and daughters of the Lord, the all-powerful,
the perfect good?"</p>

<p>"Is not man bound also?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Most certainly he is: his relations with woman
are such, that, no matter how much he may think it
otherwise, she can not be bound without involving
him. But the year of 'full release, of jubilee,' is on
its way: it will come, and not tarry, for the Lord of
hosts hath declared it."</p>

<p>"When do you commence your treasonable campaign,
Mr. Rockman?" asked Rose.</p>

<p>"I have commenced it, and you have been acting
as spy, little one," he replied gayly (he could go
from the solemn to the playful, or the ridiculous, as
quickly as a musician can touch the different keys of
an instrument).</p>

<p>"Me a spy!" she repeated, holding up her hands
in mock distress.</p>

<p>"Yes, you a spy. For what else were you in the
parlor of a disreputable house, and dressed as a
boy?"</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>"Oh, oh! and you have entrapped me into this!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, little one: you went to my chief
counselor of your own accord, and without my
knowledge; if she persuaded you to enlist, it is not
my fault."</p>

<p>"Of course not, Mr. Rockman; I never saw a man
yet who was to blame: Eve did it."</p>

<p>"Take care there, you little rebel," he said, as she
snapped her fingers at him, and ran up stairs to her
room.</p>

<p>After Rose left, we had some further talk as to
the course to be pursued; I, as usual, bringing in
objections, principally against the deceit practiced in
appearing in disguise. I could not quite reconcile it
with my ideas of right.</p>

<p>"Society is one mass of deceit now," I said; "and
I can not see the good that can come from doing what
we condemn, of doing evil that good may come."</p>

<p>"We are not doing evil, but good," he urged: "we
are only gaining a knowledge of the evil, that we
may know how to overcome it with good; or, in
other words, that we may supersede it with good.
Time was when it would have been sin to me to
have planned otherwise than for the present order
of things; but that time has gone by; it has been
weighed and found wanting, and must pass away.
The 'young child' that is to take its place is already
born; but its life is threatened, will be taken if it is
not carried into Egypt, is not hidden, covered with
darkness, disguise. Egypt signifies darkness."</p>

<p>"You quote Scripture very readily," I said; "but
you can not convince me, sir, that your application
is always correct."</p>

<!-- page 130 -->

<p>"Perhaps not, but history only repeats itself. The
facts of one age become the symbols of the next;
while its symbols in turn are to become the facts
of the coming one on a still grander scale."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said I, despairing of making any
headway against him in argument, "do as you think
best: I am not responsible for your sins or mistakes."</p>

<p>"And you are glad to be free of the load," he
responded, laughing at me, as usual when I showed
annoyance at defeat.</p>

<p>"You are an enigma to me," I answered: "you
make me hold my breath with your lofty flights,
make me feel as though one of the old prophets had
returned to earth, and then propose methods of action
that shock all my previous ideas of right."</p>

<p>"Don't try to solve the riddle, child.</p>

<p class="small">'God is his own interpreter,<br/>

And he will make it plain.' "</p>

<p>Then, as he generally did when he had wrought
me up to about such a pitch, he left me to my own
thoughts.</p>

<p class="small">CHANGE OF BASE.</p>

</div>

<p>"MINNIE has been absent from the city for
a few days, but when she returns she
will let me know," said Rose, in reply
to a question from me as to what Miss
Morris was doing; "and then I wish you
would go with me to see her."</p>

<p>"I would rather not," I said hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Who was it that taught me to be brave?" she
asked, looking me searchingly in the eye.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," I stammered.</p>

<p>"But, as you have never been trodden under foot,
you prefer to keep at a distance," she said bitterly.</p>

<p>"Rose, Rose, do not say that!"</p>

<p>"It is the truth, nevertheless: you have been, you
are, very kind to me, you urge me to self-respect, tell
me that the fault was not mine; and yet, ere you are
aware of it, you show me that you do not forget, that
you think it well enough for me to go where it would
not be quite proper for you."</p>

<p>"But, Rose"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know; you feel that I have nothing to lose, but
something to gain; while you risk your good name,
and have nothing to gain;" and she burst into a
passion of weeping. "No, don't touch me now, I

<!-- page 132 -->

can not bear it," she said, as I tried to put my arms
around her: "it is not pity I want, but genuine
respect, and I will have it too, or nothing," she exclaimed,
starting up, and walking rapidly back and
forth through the room, and then out into the hall,
with a movement as though she was smothering.</p>

<p>I had never seen her in such a mood, and knew
not how to comfort her, and so was silent; but my
heart was busy with questionings. Had I indeed
given the poor child cause to feel thus? "<i>Poor
child</i>," yes, I saw it now; in that very term was
wrapped the pity from which she shrank.</p>

<p>"Rose, my dear friend, my sister, you distress me
beyond measure," I said at length.</p>

<p>She came, and laid her head in my lap like a
wearied child. "My best of friends, forgive me; but a
wounded spirit is hard to bear, and mine is very sore."</p>

<p>"I will go with you to see Minnie, or you can
invite her here," I said.</p>

<p>"Will you invite her as one who must come in
disguise, or as an honored guest whom you can introduce
to your friends?" she asked, raising her head.</p>

<p>"I should insult my friends by doing that; not in
reality, but by trampling on their individual rights,"
I said, after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"How? I can not see that," she said.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have me introduce to you one
with whom I knew you did not wish to have even a
speaking acquaintance?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I should not."</p>

<p>"You would feel that I had done what I had no
right to do, at least without your consent."</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>"I should," she replied. "I see I was wrong; but
Minnie is really far nobler than many who scorn
her."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it, Rose, and has self-respect
enough to rest in that nobility."</p>

<p>"And I will try to have self-respect too, and rest
in what I am, instead of trying to grasp at what is
not freely and fully accorded," she said, throwing
her arms about my neck.</p>

<p>I had learned a lesson, and so had she; so the hour
was not lost, nor the tears wasted. The next morning
a note came, telling of Minnie's return. Rose
laid it in my hand when she had read it; and I
asked, "Which shall it be? will you invite her here,
or shall I go to see her with you?"</p>

<p>She blushed, laughed, and then said, "I had like
to have been caught in my own trap. I have always
gone veiled, and so dressed that I would not have
been known from dozens of others; though one
reason for my doing so was, I feared I should meet
and be recognized by Robert Crandall."</p>

<p>"There is no such fear as that in my case," I said.</p>

<p>"I do not know about that: if he should meet and
recognize you, and see you enter there, he would be
sure to use it against you, if he ever found it for his
interest to do so," was her reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I do not see but we shall have to go disguised
after all, Rose."</p>

<p>"Wait, I have just thought how we can fix it. I
will send Minnie word that we are coming to-night;
and she will let us in by a private way leading from
another street, the servants' entrance."</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p>"Do so," I said. And that night, for the first
time in my life, I stood within the house of one
whose steps, according to Scripture, "take hold on
hell." But there is another declaration which says
of publicans and harlots, "They go into the kingdom
of heaven before you," which indicates that steps
may take hold on hell, and yet be really nearer
heaven than are the steps of many who think themselves
almost there.</p>

<p>What kind of a people are we? What manner
of country have we?</p>

<p>The word of "the Master" is on the lip, the
places in which they say to worship him point heavenward
from valley and hilltop; and yet I have
known a Christian woman, so called, pay five dollars
for a toy to amuse her child, while Christians in the
same city were hungry for bread; yes, and her
Christian husband, to keep peace in the family, felt
it his duty to give his wife that money for that foolish
object, when it would have been his pleasure to
have given it to that poor, toiling woman whose
child had not enough to keep it comfortable.</p>

<p>"I will not be a woman's slave," said a man in my
hearing not long since. Men are slaves, as well as
women, under the present order of society. Eben
Rockman's words are true, for I find the proof everywhere.</p>

<p>Yes, I went to the house of Minnie Morris. I saw
her boarders in their rich attire, saw the luxury with
which they were surrounded, and I thought of the
toiling seamstress in her garret, of honest poverty
and its reward; and I felt that a nation calling itself

<!-- page 135 -->

Christian ought to be damned for permitting such
things to exist.</p>

<p>But I must cease moralizing, and come to practical
work, relating first, however, that I had promised
the ladies of the church I attended, that I would go
with them the next day to visit some poor families
who were in need of aid. I told Minnie this; and
she promised me a donation from each of the ladies,
if I would pledge them to expend it myself, instead
of giving it into the hands of any committee.</p>

<p>I gave the required pledge, and she collected for
me thirty dollars. It was expended to good purpose,
I assure you, dear reader; and I took good care also,
that those who were benefited knew who the donors
were. Perhaps I was a little foolish in this, but I
like to see justice done even to the Magdalen.</p>

<p>But, coming to business, Minnie had been to the
capital of the State, and had made arrangements to
spend the time there during the session of the legislature;
and she wished myself, Rose, and Mr. Rockman
to be in the city also. "My girls are all going,"
she said: "they begin to get some idea of Rockman's
plans; and they say that they will aid in furnishing
means, so that it will cost you nothing but your
time."</p>

<p>"I do not see how I can leave for so long," I said;
but the fact was, I rather shrank from taking such a
step.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can! shut up your house, or let it to
some one; I will take it, and pay you well for it, if
there is no other way. No," she replied, reading
my thought, "I do not wish to put any one into it;

<!-- page 136 -->

and it need not matter to you, if I keep it shut up,
so that you are paid."</p>

<p>"I shall not consent to that," I said; "and it seems
to me that this is like handling edge-tools."</p>

<p>"Well, we must handle edge-tools, if we would
learn how to use them; and they are capital in severing
bonds. If it is information that you need to aid
in changing this cursed state of things, you will
never have a better opportunity for obtaining it; and
as Rockman is your uncle, and Rose your sister,
you will have nothing to do but board them; that
is, when my <i>lover</i> and <i>errand-boy</i> are absent."</p>

<p>"Rose does not look enough like me to pass for my
sister. Miss Morris."</p>

<p>"Well, half-sister, then, or sister's child."</p>

<p>"I should like that," said Rose, "it would be easy
to call you aunt."</p>

<p>"You, madam," continued Minnie, "need know
nothing of that infamous creature Minnie Morris;
and Rose and your uncle will be other parties altogether
when with me."</p>

<p>"Don't," said I, for it hurt me to hear her speak
so of herself.</p>

<p>"That is what the world counts me, madam, and
it were well to look things squarely in the face;
but, when infamy meets infamy, 'then comes the tug
of war;' and Robert Crandall will be there as one
infamy, for he has been elected representative from
this district."</p>

<p>This last decided me, for I hated Robert Crandall
as the Devil is said to hate a Christian; and, if I
could in any manner aid in bringing home to him

<!-- page 137 -->

what he so richly deserved, I should be more than
repaid. I am ashamed to own that personal feeling
had more to do in the matter than the thought of
the ultimate good to be brought out of all this; but,
nevertheless, it is the truth.</p>

<p>Rockman and Minnie were both above me in this
respect; for Rockman was moved only from the
plane of principle, and Minnie had caught the inspiration
of the idea that even such as she might aid in
bringing in the universal good.</p>

<p>And so things were arranged in accordance with
Minnie's planning. In a quiet street, away from the
bustle of business, a few furnished rooms were found,
of which Mr. Rockman and his "<i>niece</i>" took possession,
a younger lady being with them a portion of
the time, and, when absent, was supposed to be
away from the city.</p>

<p>In another portion of the city, Minnie Morris the
courtesan opened a boarding-house for ladies, which
was soon filled with an array of beauty, such as
senators, representatives, judges, and others of high
position, are not likely to pass unnoticed. True,
there are exceptions to all rules; but I am speaking
in general terms.</p>

<p>Remember, kind reader, I am not writing to please,
but to illustrate life as it is; for, only as we see it
thus, can we judge of it correctly, and of what steps
to take to make it better.</p>

<p>It is folly for us to think that our sons and daughters
can be saved from the evils which threaten, by
keeping them in ignorance of what exists; for ignorance
is the poorest of all safeguards.</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

<p>The home of the quiet, staid citizen, and the home
of the courtesan,&mdash;who of all the thronging crowd
imagined that there was any connection between
them? Not one.</p>

<p>Little does that fine-looking senator dream, as he
pays court to the beautiful woman to whom he has
just been introduced, that she saw him only the
night before in the spacious parlor of Minnie
Morris.</p>

<p>"One-half at least of the most popular of the
gentlemen here, I have seen there," Rose thought as
she looked over the crowd.</p>

<p>Rose had been into society but little, for she knew
that Robert Crandall and his proud wife were there,
and she did not wish to meet them where he could
recognize her; at least not till her stay in the city
was nearly over.</p>

<p>Several times during the winter she had seen him
at Minnie's house, and had the dates, with the record
of much that she had heard him say, and to whom,
in her possession. She wished to give him a lesson;
but it would not do to have it suspected that there
was a spy at Minnie's house; for every visitor would
be warned, and the money upon which they
depended to carry out their plans would be withheld.</p>

<p>"Man controls the purse, and through it controls
us," said Minnie one day, when discussing this question.
"True, we handle a great deal of it; but we
must submit to his terms, one of which is, we <i>must
not betray him</i>. He can betray us. We must be
public property, and objects of public scorn, in consequence;

<!-- page 139 -->

but he, oh, no! he must not be exposed;
we must not even speak to him on the street."</p>

<p>"But woman is beginning to fill places of trust,
and to command better pay," I said: "I see many
of them here and elsewhere acting as clerks; and I
find them in telegraph-offices and post-offices, where
I am told they get good pay; sufficient, at least, to
maintain them comfortably."</p>

<p>Minnie's eyes flashed. "Yes, and who has control
of such appointments? Men, to be sure; and do
you think that they forget their pockets in this? I
tell you no! A man in office who supports a woman
for her company can get her a place where she can
earn her own money, and yet be subject to him. He
thus saves his money; and, if she dares to refuse
him, he gets her turned out of her position, and
another takes her place.</p>

<p>"Oh, this cursed money-power!" she continued,
getting up, and walking back and forth like a caged
tigress.</p>

<p>"But all women who hold such positions are not
of that class," I said.</p>

<p>"True, they are not; some of them are daughters
or sisters, whose fathers or brothers have the influence
to secure them a place. But what of that?
They thus lessen their own expenses, and save
money to spend with us. This is the rule. There
are exceptions, noble ones, I admit; but, so long as
men have the disposal of places where money can be
made, the tendency is to give them to men, or to
women, who will serve them,&mdash;will serve them by
doing the same work for less pay, if in no other
way."</p>

<!-- page 140 -->

<p>"I do not see how things are ever to be any better,"
said Rose sadly; "for, if what they tell us is
true, it must go on from bad to worse."</p>

<p>"If what is true?" asked Rockman.</p>

<p>"If it is true that the condition and surroundings
of the mother before the birth of the child determine
its character so far as this life is concerned."</p>

<p>"If that is true," said Minnie, "I can not see who
is to blame for any thing."</p>

<p>"Conditions are to blame," laughed Rose, and at
the very absurdity of the idea she had advanced.</p>

<p>"Conditions have no moral character," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Then why should those acts have, that are the
result of conditions?" she asked with a puzzled
expression upon her face, as though she hardly knew
whether to treat the matter seriously or not.</p>

<p>"But we make the conditions," I persisted.</p>

<p>"And they in turn make us," said Rockman; "still
we, as individuals, do not make the conditions which
control us; they are made for us; and we must adapt
ourselves to them, be ground to the dust by them,
or overcome for ourselves and others, by making
better conditions.</p>

<p>"The masses of the people never think beyond
the law of adaptation, that of adapting themselves to
conditions. Of these but few can succeed; and the
others are ground, become grist, are tributary to
those few. This is because conditions are such that
the success of one is the failure of half a dozen, perhaps
more. This of necessity."</p>

<p>"But what are we going to do about it? that is
the question," persisted Rose.</p>

<!-- page 141 -->

<p>"That we are trying to learn," he said; "and to do
this it is necessary to get behind the scenes, to learn
the working of the ropes; in fact, we must find the
principle upon which the machine moves, learn the
natural tendency of that principle; and, if the evil of
its workings is the result of ignorance of its proper
application, then we must set that ignorance before
the people in such a light that they will see and
remove it.</p>

<p>"But, if the principle itself is wrong, then we
must seek a principle, that, when applied, will produce
no such results, and reconstruct accordingly."</p>

<p>"A big job, Mr. Rockman," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we are big folks; the powers within us
have but just begun to unfold as yet. As a man
thinketh, so is he, or she, if it is a woman who
thinks; and the first step toward doing a thing is to
think that we can do it,&mdash;to believe that we have
the power. The next is to look the ground all over,
within and without. Then, having learned what is
to be done, and how to do it, we must go to work
with a determination to accomplish the result
sought.</p>

<p>"I have become satisfied that man grows, progresses,
mentally and spiritually, in the realm of
mind as applied to matter, and in the realm of mind
as applied to the moral and the spiritual, <i>just in proportion,
and in the direction, that he believes in himself</i>.
It is the most pernicious of all doctrines, that
which teaches mankind that there is one single thing
necessary for the happiness, the perfection of the
race, that it has not within itself the power of
attaining to."</p>

<!-- page 142 -->

<p>"Would you put God out of the universe?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Indeed I would not, madam; but we shut him
away from the race when we claim that he has not
the power to work out their perfection through
themselves. God worketh in <i>us</i>, is in <i>us</i>; but <i>we</i> do
not believe it, do not believe in him, in the <i>I am</i>
within <i>us</i>, in ourselves: so we fail."</p>

<p>"I do not see but you make yourself and God one
and the same," I said.</p>

<p>"Then there is at-one-ment, reconciliation; and I
am at peace with him."</p>

<p>"That is not what I mean."</p>

<p>"And what do you mean, madam?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;well, perhaps I can not exactly express
it; but it seems to me that one does not quarrel
with one's self; and if God is in us, is our essential
life, then there is, has been, no need of reconciliation."</p>

<p>"But we do contend with ourselves; there are the
fiercest of conflicts right here within our own beings;
and when we find, become reconciled to ourselves,
then we are at peace with God. No use in talking,
madam; I know that you do not believe in Jesus in
the sense that he has been taught to the people;
neither can I say that I do; but there is a deep meaning
in the words, 'I and my Father are one.' "</p>

<p>"Emmanuel, God with us; this must become true
of every soul,&mdash;of the race."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we have left business to talk
theology," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Morris, you mistake: we are only preparing

<!-- page 143 -->

the way for business. Faith is necessary to
works; and we said in the commencement that we
progress as we believe in ourselves; and it is true.
Suppose, now, that you, when Crandall forsook you,
had had no faith in yourself, had not sensed that,
though condemned by the world, you could live as
pure a life in the midst of vice, as others could when
surrounded by the protection of that society which
cast you out, where would you have been now?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!" she replied, as the tears
started.</p>

<p>"Look over that life for the years that you have
been thus condemned, and tell me if you know of a
single soul who has been made worse because of
you?"</p>

<p>"Not one," she replied with brightening eye, "not
one, but many are better. I have held more than
one back from the path of sin, who would have been
destroyed but for my watchfulness; I have given
many a dollar to the sick and suffering; and I have
counseled those who have boarded with me to be as
good as conditions would permit; and never have I
urged a poor girl to submit to one whom I knew
was hateful to her because the rules of business
would have given me an extra dollar thereby; and
the only lover I have had since (except yourself, and
you are bogus) I accepted in the interest of others,
but could not endure it, so gave him up."</p>

<p>Rose and I laughed at this joke on Rockman; but
he continued, "And you have learned that which,
if you will use aright, will yet bless the whole world;
you have gained a knowledge of the under-currents
of society."</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>"Oh, Mr. Rockman, if I could only believe it!"</p>

<p>"I told you we had not forgotten business," he
continued; "and now I must go on showing that
self-belief is faith in God, that only in the direction
in which we believe in ourselves do we succeed.
Self-belief, that which is genuine, compels belief
from others."</p>

<p>"This is quite contrary to the teachings we have
received," said Minnie thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And what have our teachings brought us? Look
about you, and see the condition of society. In
the direction in which man has believed in himself,
in the promptings of the God within, he has succeeded.
Our achievements are grand; our steamboats,
railroads, telegraphic lines, telescopes, our
wonderful machinery that takes the place of hand-work,
all tell the same story. We send our messages
under the sea, we go through the hearts of the
mountains, we measure the stars, we chase up the
comets in their flight,&mdash;all this, and much more;
and why?</p>

<p>"Simply because we have believed that we had
the power to do it. Jesus said, 'All power is given
me.' He was our <i>brother</i>; remember that,&mdash;<i>our
brother</i>.</p>

<p>"I say we have succeeded gloriously in the direction
that self-belief has compelled action. Not one
of the achievements we have named would ever have
been accomplished had there not been a belief in its
possibility first. I do not say that all believed: far
from it; the masses did not believe; they opposed.
They could not believe till the idea was made manifest,

<!-- page 145 -->

actualized, born into matter. Only those to
whom God had whispered the idea could believe
without seeing.</p>

<p>"And they must work it out for themselves; the
God who whispered it to the ears of their inner
consciousness working through their own powers."</p>

<p>"Any one would know, to hear you talk five minutes,
that you had been a preacher, Uncle Rockman,"
said Rose, with a smile and manner which showed
her interest in what he was saying, and at the same
time indicated a desire to catch breath, to rest from
the weight of the thoughts that were being expressed.</p>

<p>"And you thus make me remember, little Rose,
that there is another side to this question,&mdash;the side
in which man has not believed in himself; and that
is the moral, the spiritual side. We have been taught
to believe that on this side of ourselves we were
totally depraved; that we could not do a good deed,
or think a good thought, without God's help. God
must do this work for us; <i>we</i> could do nothing.</p>

<p>"What has been the result, friends? What has
been the result, Rose, Minnie, and you, my fair monitor,
who in your goodness of heart have so often
tried to soften and polish my rough, hard, abrupt
ways? Just what might have been expected under
such teachings. We are so mean, so low, so hypocritical,
so utterly false as a people, that it sometimes
makes me blush to think that I am human.</p>

<p>"GREAT GOD!" he exclaimed, rising, and walking
rapidly back and forth, his tall form stooping, his
hands behind him, and his head dropped forward

<!-- page 146 -->

upon his heaving chest, as though grief and shame
were well-nigh crushing him. For several minutes
he continued his rapid motion, till finally his step
grew slower; the look of shame and agony disappeared,
giving place to one of the proud consciousness
of power, as he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But God, the Lord God of Eben Rockman, has
whispered it to his soul, that these things need not
be; that the complicated machine called society is
constructed upon a false principle; that it must be
replaced by something better; that there must be a
new heaven and a new earth, in which shall dwell
righteousness, or right conditions; and to this end,
Minnie, Rose, all of you, are aiding me to investigate
the present structure, that its weak points may
become apparent; for, <i>by the Eternal!</i> it must die;
the sinful, the accursed thing! it must die, that the
reign of righteousness may commence."</p>

<p>The terrible earnestness with which he uttered
these words thrilled, awed us, till silence seemed
the natural expression of our feelings; but at length
Minnie broke it by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have come to business, at length."</p>

<p>"And enough of it," I added.</p>

<p>"And time enough to do it in," said Rockman.</p>

<p>"I do not know about that; it seems to me that
one short life is hardly sufficient for the commencement
of such a work, to say nothing of completing
it," I said.</p>

<p>Rockman turned upon me a luminous, questioning
gaze. "What do you mean by one short life?"</p>

<p>"The few years that we can remain here on earth,
of course."</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>"And where are you going then, pray?" he continued,
with the same look.</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir; wherever God sends me, I
expect."</p>

<p>"I expect to stay here," he said slowly,&mdash;"here
upon the earth upon which I came into mortal existence.
It is my home; and I intend to spend some
part, at least, of eternity in making it beautiful.
Those who have left our sight, and those who are
here, are yet to be one family, to be re-united,&mdash;made
one; the at-one-ment for which we all pray. I
shall stand at the latter day upon earth, '<i>and in my
flesh</i>,' says Job."</p>

<p>"You do not believe in the literal resurrection of
the body?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I believe in resurrection of all things, my friend;
all things that go down come up again in some form:
A recent poet says of one who was called dead,&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>'Look for blossoms with fairer hues,<br/>

When earth shall smile into bloom once more;<br/>

Search in the bright-eyed pansy's face,<br/>

For richer tints than ever before.<br/>

Stars will bud in the sober moss;<br/>

For Nature will stretch her floral laws,<br/>

And add new links to the primitive chain<br/>

Of producing forces, only because<br/>

Of all this brightness gone to the ground.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The beauty that faded into a blank<br/>

<i>Must</i> burst into blossom again, somewhere,&mdash;<br/>

All this beauty gone to the ground.'</p>

</div>

<p>"And I believe it, feel, know, that it must be so.

<!-- page 148 -->

Why is it that we die, so they call it; why is it that
we drop these bodies? I will tell you. It is because
there is no harmony between them and our
spirits; the matter of which they are composed is
not fine enough for us. They are better adapted to
the outside coarseness; but that is too coarse for
them; we must protect ourselves from without; and
yet this double friction, that from within cutting
away the links, as the diamond severs bars of steel,
or scratches the hardest glass, and that from without
filing and grinding like sand,&mdash;these two steal away
the forces, the strength of the body, like two
thieves; and between them it bows its head, and
gives up the ghost, or spirit.</p>

<p>"But 'our God is a refining fire;' matter submitted
to this refining process gives us</p>

<p class="small">'Blossoms of fairer hues,<br/>

Richer tints than ever before;'</p>

<p>"And finally matter will become so refined that the
spirit can draw to itself a body suited to its needs.
Then there shall be no more death; for the former
things will have passed away, and all things will
have become new."</p>

<p>"And you think when time comes, that we can
clothe ourselves again with material bodies, and hold
them?" asked Rose.</p>

<p>"We can not help it," he replied: "it will cling to
us as the magnet attracts steel, will clothe our spirits
in forms of eternal beauty, will give us eyes whose
luminous depths are like stars; lips</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p class="small">'Full to wasting with honeyed bliss,&mdash;<br/>

Lips that it were never a sin<br/>

For anybody to wish to kiss.'</p>

<p>"Why! the gray-haired earth will herself grow
young again, when the work to which we, acting in
harmony with the divine within us,&mdash;the work
which we have set ourselves to do,&mdash;is completed."</p>

<p>"Don't," said Minnie, drawing a long breath:
"you will carry us so far away that we shall never
get back again."</p>

<p>"No danger; business will bring us back. We
must help to refine a great deal of matter yet, in the
way of eating, drinking, and wearing. The practicalities
of life hold us to the actual while they still
carry us forward toward the ideal."</p>

<p>"If wearing has any thing to do with the work we
have undertaken, I can come to the practical without
the least difficulty," said Rose; "for I must
decide what to wear to the next and last ball of the
season."</p>

<p>"From immortal bodies to a ball-dress!" I exclaimed.
"Well, I have heard people tell of going
from the sublime to the ridiculous, but I never saw
it exemplified before; and it has shocked my breath
nearly out of me, the transition was so sudden."</p>

<p>Rose laughed, and sang,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"One more unfortunate<br/>

Gone to her death,"</p>

<p>and then, "Minnie, what shall I wear?"</p>

<p>"Let me see what you have, and then I can tell
you if you need any thing new," she replied.</p>

<!-- page 150 -->

<p>"Come, then, and I will show you;" and Rose ran
off to her room followed by Minnie, while I turned
to Rockman with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you going to leave here without confronting
that villain?"</p>

<p>"To what villain do you refer? there are so many
here, one needs something more definite."</p>

<p>"You know very well that I mean Crandall," I
replied, nettled at his coolness; for I cared more just
then to humble Robert Crandall, than I did about
what seemed to me Rockman's chimeras.</p>

<p>I liked his enthusiasm, it is true, and especially
when I saw it manifested in any practical work of
to-day; but his plans and anticipations for the future
were all too vague, too dreamy, for me. I could wish
they might come true, but I saw no way to make
them so, and I could not puzzle myself over them;
but I did see a way to strike a hard but just blow at
the one who had so wronged Rose, and I ached to do
it.</p>

<p>Rockman smiled, as he read my feelings from my
telltale face, and said, "We will try to gratify you,
you desire it so much."</p>

<p>"To gratify me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you seem to take more interest in his particular
wickedness than in that of any other single
individual."</p>

<p>"I do not understand it," I said, "how Rose and
Minnie can keep so cool about him."</p>

<p>"Minnie's boarders have a right to choose their
own company, and so she can not very well avoid
meeting him frequently; and Rose has borne her part

<!-- page 151 -->

like a martyr. It has not been considered politic to
attack him. Rose, as you know, has not been to
any public gathering but once since she has been in
the city. She would not have gone then, only she
heard Crandall say, the night before, that he could
not attend, as circumstances made it necessary for
him to be absent."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that too; but how about this ball?
Will he be there, and will she confront him?" I
asked, my impatience getting control.</p>

<p>"She will not shrink from meeting him."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go too, for I want to see them
meet," said I, starting up as though I must commence
getting ready that very moment.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have me attend you, dressed
in the disguise of Minnie's lover?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not care; any way, so that I can see
him abashed."</p>

<p>"I am going with Rose in that character, and we
can all go together then," he said.</p>

<p>The ball came off according to notice, and was
counted a brilliant affair. I took Mr. St. John's, to
wit, Mr. Rockman's arm; and Rose made the rounds
of the room with Senator Dillenough. We, St.
John and I, managed to get very near to where
Robert Crandall was standing, when I asked loud
enough for him to hear me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is that beautiful lady with Senator Dillenough?"</p>

<p>"Some new face, I think," said St. John, after a
moment: "we shall find out presently; let us get
nearer to them."</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p>I saw Robert Crandall's eyes follow mine as I
indicated Rose. He did not seem to recognize her,
but yet he could not keep his eyes off her. "Where
have I seen that face?" he said to the gentleman to
whom he was talking.</p>

<p>"It is well to pretend that you have seen her
before; it serves as an excuse for your evident admiration:
but it will not do; I must seek out Mrs.
Crandall, and tell her to be on her guard," replied
the gentleman, laughing.</p>

<p>"And thus give her to understand that you think
her hold upon me so weak, it may possibly break;
you dare not insult her thus," retorted Crandall in
the same playful manner; and then his eyes turned
again toward Rose. A set was being formed for
dancing, and she and the Senator led. I watched
Crandall, and he watched her.</p>

<p>As soon as she was seated, he sought the Senator,
and requested an introduction. I was near Rose
now, and where I could see both their faces as they
met. She saw him coming, and knew that he had
not yet recognized her. Her cheek paled and then
flushed, while her eyes fairly flashed.</p>

<p>"Miss Barron, allow me to introduce to you the
Hon. Mr. Crandall from"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The gracious Senator was startled out of his polite
bow with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, I do not allow it," casting at
the same time a look upon Crandall, that well might
be termed a haughty stare.</p>

<p>I saw by the flash of intelligence upon Crandall's
face that recognition came with the name; but,

<!-- page 153 -->

when she so thoroughly ignored him, he was white
with rage. He opened his lips to speak, and I saw
he meant mischief. St. John laid his hand upon
Crandall's arm, and whispered,</p>

<p>"Not a word, or you will regret it."</p>

<p>"I see it all now; you brought her here; you are
Minn Morris's lover, and it is some of her doings.
I knew them both long ago," replied Crandall in an
undertone. There was too much at stake for him to
make an open charge against Rose, though in his
rage it was what he would have done, had he not
been prevented by the words of St. John.</p>

<p>"I am not Miss Morris's lover, never was. Things
are not always what they seem," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Who in God's name are you, then?"</p>

<p>Come this way, and I will show you."</p>

<p>Crandall was only too glad to get away from the
questioning eyes around him, and he followed St.
John into the ante-room. It was empty: enough of
the disguise was removed to show the face of Eben
Rockman to the astonished gaze of the Hon. Mr.
Crandall.</p>

<p>"You!" he said.</p>

<p>"Me," replied Rockman. "I have long known of
the course you pursued toward Rose Barron years
since, Robert Crandall; and, if you dare to throw
out one insinuation against her, it will be the worse
for you. We have planned to some purpose, and
we can not allow you to defeat us because you have
met with a just rebuke in public."</p>

<p>"We?" said Crandall questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rose, Minnie, and I. You thought I was

<!-- page 154 -->

there as Minnie's lover; and you thought it strange
sometimes, that she allowed her waiting-boy in the
parlor so much. Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Crandall started. "And was that boy a cheat
too? Upon my soul, I believe it was Rose."</p>

<p>Again that "Ha, ha!" from Rockman.</p>

<p>"I will raise hell itself, but I will be revenged,"
said the now thoroughly excited man.</p>

<p>"You can not alarm me any there," said Rockman;
"for I am in league with hell, and, when I find such
fellows as you, can deal it out in doses to suit."</p>

<p>"I always thought that you were the Devil's self,
notwithstanding your wonderful talk about the
world's wickedness, and all of that; but I never
expected to hear you own as much," replied Crandall.</p>

<p>"You mistake, young man. I said nothing about
the Devil: I simply asserted that I was in league
with hell; and so I am with what will make your
hell till you change your course of conduct. Fire
burns; and our God is a consuming fire to those who
will not accept him as a refiner. I am at peace, consequently
in league with him, and am ready to
accept a little job of scorching when he gives me
such work to do."</p>

<p>Baffled beyond the power of words to reply, Crandall
turned and left the room; and Rockman replaced
his disguise, and returned to the side of Rose, who
had already said to Senator Dillenough, "Had Mr.
Crandall recognized me, he would not have dared to
approach me; for he knows full well that he offended
years ago beyond all hopes of forgiveness."</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>"And do you think he recognized you when you
spoke?" asked the senator.</p>

<p>"I think the name and my manner of meeting
him told him all; indeed, I am certain they did.
But with your permission I will introduce a friend."</p>

<p>"Most certainly, Miss Barron, as I know of no
one who has offended me beyond the power of forgiveness."</p>

<p>Rose colored, but took no further notice of the
remark, and quietly introduced Rockman as Mr. St.
John.</p>

<p>Senator Dillenough received him as though they
had never met before; and Rose wondered if the cool
self-possession of the man of the world would forsake
him if he knew that she saw them in conversation at
Minnie's house the week before.</p>

<p>Rockman smiled a quiet smile as he thought of
the time when Crandall would tell this same senator,
and others who had been frequent visitors at the
same place, of the trap that had been laid for them.
He did not expect to keep Crandall's mouth shut
long; but he was determined that no breath of scandal
should touch Rose that night, and the next day
they, Minnie and all, would be far away.</p>

<p>I was to return to my old home; but the others
had other plans laid, other work to do.</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<div class="center" id="IX">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">SEARCHING THE SCRIPTURES.</p>

</div>

<p>I WAS at home again, and alone. Rose,
with her sad smile, was not there;
Minnie never tripped up the back
stairs disguised as the poor seamstress
whose children needed the bread that
her hands could earn; and, when the bell rang, I
had no hopes of seeing my eccentric friend Eben
Rockman. I dreamed of them often at night, and
the mail brought me frequent letters; but this could
not supply the lack that I felt, or only in part.</p>

<p>What should I do to occupy my time, to quiet
my restlessness? One day, for want of I knew not
what, I took up the big Bible. Years before, I had
read it much; but there came a time when I felt that
I must lay it aside. I could not understand why,
but I could take no interest in its contents. I
grieved that it was so; and then a something made
me feel that the time would come when a new light
would be shed upon its pages, and that till then I
must rest content to have it closed against me.</p>

<p>In time, I lost my reverence for it as a sacred
book. That there were grand truths therein, I did
not doubt; and so there was in other books. I
would accept truth wherever found; and so years

<!-- page 157 -->

had passed in which I had seldom looked into the
Bible. But now, as I turned its pages, I saw a new
and deep meaning to much that I found there. But
one thing more than any other impressed itself upon
me, and it was this: the texts, passages, many of
them, that I had been taught to understand as referring
to another life, seemed to me now to belong particularly
to this; and still another point was, much
that had been supposed to refer to the individual
man, that man being Jesus, the Christ, the Son of
man, &amp;c., seemed to me now to refer to collective
man, to nationalities, forms of government, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I confess to a difficulty in separating that which is
literal and that which is symbolic in its meaning;
but it has been my fortune in my search after knowledge
to meet with some of the writings of Emanuel
Swedenborg, for whom his followers claim a wonderful
power; and he compares the human family to
one grand man, the atoms of which are individual
men.</p>

<p>It is as if a pyramid were constructed of stones,
each of which was in pyramidal form.</p>

<p>I am certain of this, however: whatever interpretation
may be given to the symbols and mysticisms
of that book, there is no one thing so well calculated
to stimulate the religious mind to mental action as is
this very mixing-up of the literal and the symbolic.
Indeed, much therein seems to be double in its
meaning, presenting first a literal, and then a symbolic
or representative side.</p>

<p>I might go still farther, and say that we have the
individual, the national, and the world meaning; and

<!-- page 158 -->

these repeating themselves throughout the realms of
the universal.</p>

<p>Recognizing this law in scriptural interpretation, I
found it the same old book, and yet a new one.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no one book of the Bible that has
been studied so much within a few years, in reference
to its prophetic significance, as has the Book of
Daniel; and, true to the spirit which has induced
others to do this, I began to study it also. While
doing this, I came across an obscure publication,
which professed to give some new ideas in reference
to what is written in that book.</p>

<p>I did not know as to the validity of the writer's
claim, but I did know that I had never seen the same
ideas elsewhere. This writer's name, strange to say,
was Daniel also; but he had the addition of the
uncommon title of Jones, which, I believe, is not a
Bible name. This man Daniel had also an initial T.
between the first and last division of his name, and
he does not tell us for what it stands; but as he
claims to be a theocrat, or God-sent man, perhaps
that is the significance of the T.</p>

<p>But there is another strange character mixed up
with this publication; one the last portion of whose
name analyzed would make him the son of <i>Nick</i>,
instead of God.</p>

<p>Well, these two men claim that the following passage
from the Book of Daniel,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I saw in the night visions; and, behold, one like
to the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,"
&amp;c.,&mdash;these men claim that the one like to the Son
of man, above spoken of, is a nation, a government.

<!-- page 159 -->

The preceding kingdoms, or nations, they claim, are
spoken of as beasts; that step by step the nations
have progressed till our United States stands upon
its feet as a man; has a man's heart, a man's body,
but its head is that of a beast.</p>

<p>Or, that the people, the body, have progressed
beyond the government, or head. Well, thought I
as I read, whatever these two men may be,&mdash;and one
of them says of himself that he lay in the tomb, to
wit, a lunatic asylum, three months instead of days,&mdash;whatever
they may be in and of themselves, their
interpretation of scripture looks as reasonable as that
of any D. D.; and, as to the governmental head of
this nation, if it is no better, so far as the men of
which it is composed is concerned, than are the men
I found at the capital of the State, as its representative
head, then the beast-interpretation is certainly
very applicable.</p>

<p>I studied a while longer over the theories of these
men, but finally concluded to wait and get Rockman's
idea of their views; going on, the while, with
my Bible-reading, and thinking my own thoughts in
reference to the meaning of its different passages as
they particularly impressed me.</p>

<p>One day, I was honored with a call from the
minister, the Rev. Mr. Berrian. For four successive
years he had been the pastor of the church
where I generally attended, if I could be said to
<i>attend</i> any church; for I will own I did not go very
regularly. There were two reasons for this: one
was, I could see no harmony between preaching and
practice; and another was, I did not believe in the

<!-- page 160 -->

prevailing theology, and, being quite combative, it
was not pleasant for me to listen to what to me was
error.</p>

<p>I do not wish the reader to class me as a barbarian,
however; for I believed in doing justly, and
loving mercy; and, as to walking humbly, I am not
so sure about that, and especially if humbly means
submissive. I was rebellious in my feelings. I was
not content with things as they were, nor very
patient under the workings of what the most of
people thought could not be cured.</p>

<p>The fact was, I did not then, do not now, believe
in "I can't." I believed that the difficulty lay more
in the lack of will, than in the lack of power.</p>

<p>I was surprised, and rather pleased, to see Mr.
Berrian; for, since I had been deprived of my combats
with Rockman, I was, to use a vulgar phrase,
"spoiling for a fight." The Bible was lying open
before me, and he made it a point from which to
commence conversation.</p>

<p>"I am glad, madam, to find you reading that
blessed book."</p>

<p>(Perhaps the reader would like to know who I
am. I am a woman who has loved and lost, and
that is all I choose to tell you.)</p>

<p>"I was looking over it to pass away time," I
replied.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear you speak so lightly of it; I
had hoped that you found it a source of consolation,"
was his very grave comment.</p>

<p>"I find consolation, sir, in whatever helps me to
pass my time profitably."</p>

<!-- page 161 -->

<p>"Yes, if it helps you to pass your time profitably,"
he said; "but to read the Bible simply to pass one's
time hardly indicates profitable reading."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Mr. Berrian; but I could not
pass time, unless obliged to do so, with that which
did not interest me; and, if a thing interests me,
there is a good to me in it."</p>

<p>He seemed surprised at the turn I had given to
what he intended as a clerical reproof, and said,
"Your reasoning is quite conclusive, and, when
applied to things in general, is admirable; but it
seems to me that the Bible, the book of books, God's
holy word, should be treated somewhat differently."</p>

<p>"And I, sir, regard all that can bless me, whether
in or out of the Bible, as God's word, God's blessing
to me. Can you tell me, sir, why it is that people
interpret the Bible so differently?"</p>

<p>"Because they bring their own human knowledge
to bear upon it, instead of waiting for the Spirit of
God to shine upon its pages," was his ready reply.</p>

<p>I laughed. "Excuse me, sir, I do not wish to be
rude or trifling; but, so far as my experience goes,
of all self-sufficiency, I have found that which claims
to be taught of God, the most so," I said.</p>

<p>He colored at this, but asked, "How can man
understand God's word, unless God's Spirit teach
him?"</p>

<p>And I replied by saying, "How can God teach
man except through the powers he has given him?"</p>

<p>"You mean carnal reason, I presume," he said.</p>

<p>"Is not God all and in all?" I asked.</p>

<p>To this he could but give assent; and I continued,

<!-- page 162 -->

"Then he must touch creation at all points,
have a supply for all needs. This being true, each
individual will find in the Bible that which corresponds
to his own needs, his own degree of development;
and he would do this if any other book were
given to him as God's word, he having been taught
to look to it for instruction and consolation in the
same way that he has been taught to look to that
book; and why? Because God is in all things; and,
wherever we look for him, there we find him.</p>

<p class="small">'The heart of the rosebud pineth<br/>

In darkness yet a while,&mdash;<br/>

Pines till its own expanding<br/>

That gladdens everywhere;<br/>

No more, no more in darkness.<br/>

For light is everywhere;<br/>

Then pine, soul, till you learn it,<br/>

That God is everywhere.' "</p>

<p>His face had expressed his dissent from my positions
very strongly, till I came to the poetry; and
then another chord of his nature seemed touched,
and his first words were, "Where did you find those
lines?"</p>

<p>"In the scrap-book of one the world calls infidel,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"Selected?"</p>

<p>"No, sir: original."</p>

<p class="small">" 'No more, no more in darkness,<br/>

For light is everywhere;<br/>

Then pine, soul, till you learn it,<br/>

That God is everywhere,' "</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>he repeated; and then added, "I care not what the
world says: the one who wrote those lines has been
taught of God."</p>

<p>The man, the soul within, had for the moment
got the better of his theology. He had come in a
minister; I had made a man of him, and the man was
the best of the two. I sometimes think I was born
to be on the opposite side; had he come to me
simply as a man, a friend, I should probably have
done something to have thrown him upon his ministerial
dignity; but, as it was, I had accomplished
just the reverse.</p>

<p>After this, I got along "<i>beautifully</i>" with him; no
more ministerial tones to provoke my opposition, but
the friendliness of a brother. Together we turned
the pages of the Bible, and discussed the meaning of
the different passages, sometimes agreeing, sometimes
differing; but, as there was no more assumption
on his part, there was no occasion for self-assertion
on mine.</p>

<p>He called frequently after that, and one day we
took up the Book of Daniel for discussion. I had
just pointed to the passage that says, one like to the
Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,
when I was surprised by a visit from Mr. Rockman.
I had not expected him for several weeks yet.</p>

<p>"Haven't forgotten your old uncle, child?" he
said as I met him in the hall.</p>

<p>"Not at all; but the minister is here, and we are
studying the Bible together. Come in and be introduced."</p>

<p>"Will wonders never cease? of course I will."</p>

<!-- page 164 -->

<p>"Young man," said Rockman as soon as the introduction
was over, "I used to study that book, and
preach to the people; but I have laid the book of
printed matter aside, and gone to studying God's
word as written in the human heart; and, the more
I learn, the more I find I don't know."</p>

<p>"Have laid the Bible aside, Mr. Rockman?"
said Mr. Berrian in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, as seed sown upon good ground that must
have time to grow. Many of its passages enlarge
upon me as I go in and out among the people, like
to wells of water springing up into everlasting life;
passages that have taken root, sir, and do not need
to be reset and tended continually."</p>

<p>"But here is a passage, uncle, that I want you to
look at," said I.</p>

<p>He read it, and asked, "What of it? I have
preached from that very text scores of times."</p>

<p>"But did you ever think that the 'one like unto
the Son of man' was intended to represent a form
of government?"</p>

<p>He started as though a new thought had struck
him, and forcibly too: "No. Where did you get
that idea?"</p>

<p>"No matter where I got it; tell me what you
think of it."</p>

<p>"Think? why, I do not know; yes, why not? The
term 'beasts' is used to represent earthly governments
that perish; and why should not 'one like to
the Son of man' represent a form of government that
shall endure? I will think of that."</p>

<p>"But I have something more, uncle; the writer

<!-- page 165 -->

who suggests this idea says that governments have
progressed till we have here in our own country one
with the body of a man, the people being the body,
and the head of a beast, the government being the
head."</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment in silence, and then
said, "I must think into this matter; I may here
find the key to what I am seeking."</p>

<p>Mr. Berrian seemed equally interested, but was
inclined to give it, the government, into the hands of
the saints of the Most High, or to the church.</p>

<p>"Pretty saints we find in the church," said Rockman.</p>

<p>"But they are not all bad, Mr. Rockman," said
the minister.</p>

<p>"No, they are not: many of them are most excellent
people. But I have found outside of all churches,
outside of the pale of society even, better saints than
I ever found in the church; yes, Jesus told the truth
when he said, 'Publicans and harlots go into the
kingdom of heaven before you.' "</p>

<p>"I believe that, Mr. Rockman."</p>

<p>"You say that you do, sir; you think that you
do: but with God in the Constitution, as you church
people are working for, such would have little
chance here on earth."</p>

<p>"They would have the chance to repent and be
saved the same as now, Mr. Rockman."</p>

<p>"We are not talking of a salvation that fits for
another state of existence, but of a place in this
that will give us a chance for life. I tell you, Mr.
Berrian, God never transcends the governing law;

<!-- page 166 -->

and, were he to take possession of a beast's head, he
would be forced to act through a beast's head and in
a beastly manner.</p>

<p>"I believe the man this lady speaks of is right.
Our national head is constructed in the form of a
beast's head. We have the animal, the lower brain
organs represented in our national structure; but the
higher organs are not there, in organized form I
mean."</p>

<p>"And is that the sense in which your author
means that governments are formed after the pattern
of the beast?" asked Mr. Berrian, turning to me.</p>

<p>"It is, sir, though I had not thought to speak of
it; and now it is not necessary, for Uncle Rockman
has caught the idea, and I am certain that he will
follow it to its legitimate conclusion," I replied.</p>

<p>"And I shall be glad to share in that investigation.
I am heartily glad that I have made your
acquaintance," said Mr. Berrian, bowing to us both;
"for you have given me more food for thought than
I have gathered from my entire congregation for the
last two years."</p>

<p>"You will not find the goats all on the outside,
nor all the sheep inside, of church walls," said Rockman.</p>

<p>"I presume not," he replied, "but I must bid you
Good-day."</p>

<p>And I was glad to have him go, for I wanted to
ask after Rose and Minnie.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">FURTHER ADVENTURES.</p>

</div>

<p>"WHAT brought you back so soon?" I
asked, as soon as Mr. Berrian had
gone. "I was not expecting you for
a month yet; and how are Rose and
Minnie?"</p>

<p>"One question at a time, please: the Lord told
me to come."</p>

<p>"The Lord told you to come! Now, Mr. Rockman,
will you please tell me what you mean by that expression?
I have heard you use it before, and I can
not understand why you say it."</p>

<p>"You, with the Bible open before you, do not
know any thing of the God within? have you never
yet been still enough to hear his voice, or her
voice?"</p>

<p>"Her voice?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Why do you repeat my words? Yes, her voice.
The book says God made man in his own image,
male and female; now, why is it not just as proper to
say 'her voice,' as 'his voice'? Indeed, in my case,
I think it would be her voice; in yours, perhaps his
voice."</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me what you mean," I
said in an impatient tone.</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>"I mean this, my child: there is a side of us
which is related to, touches the unseen world; a side
so different in its action from that which connects us
with this busy, bustling life, that we hardly know of
its existence. Now, if we are in God's image, double,
male and female in our very natures, then this internal
self will be opposite in this respect to the external;
and this internal self is, or should be, the
controlling power, the focalizing center, of the infinite
as our God."</p>

<p>"So it is an inner feeling that prompts you to do
or not to do a thing, for which at the time you can
give no reason, that you call the voice of God."</p>

<p>"Precisely," he replied, and then asked, "But
what about Rose and Minnie? have you forgotten
them in your search after my God?"</p>

<p>"You said one question at a time, sir; and I
thought I would get at the bottom meaning of this
one before I took up the other; unless, indeed, it is
like a certain pit we read of, bottomless; but, if you
are ready to tell me, I shall be glad to hear about
Rose and Minnie."</p>

<p>"Sharp for a woman who has been visiting with
the minister," he retorted.</p>

<p>"Yes; but what about Rose and Minnie?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I left them well."</p>

<p>"But when am I to see them again?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That I can not tell you, little woman."</p>

<p>"When and where did you leave them?" I continued,
for there was a look of mischief in his eye which
showed me there was something that he was waiting
to tell.</p>

<!-- page 169 -->

<p>"I left them about an hour before you saw my
genial face, and about ten miles from here, at a little
railroad village called Iris. There! I have answered
two questions, and without stopping: have you another
to propose?"</p>

<p>"Yes: how long do they remain there?"</p>

<p>"That I can not exactly tell;" he glanced at the
clock as he said this, and I exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are coming here!"</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Lord told me!"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess he has told you the truth this
time. I believe they intend to come up on the
evening train, and that will be here about seven
o'clock."</p>

<p>"And you have kept this back all this time," I
said, going to him and shaking him, in the exuberance
of my joy.</p>

<p>"Don't be too much elated," said he; "for if your
new acquaintance, the minister, should learn that the
notorious Minnie Morris visited you, he might faint
at the thought of such contamination; at least, he
would never turn the leaves of the Bible with you
again."</p>

<p>"Hang the minister!" said I. "Minnie is worth
a dozen of him, is nearer the kingdom now than he
is."</p>

<p>Rockman laughed. "You are really improving,
child; but I wouldn't hang the minister; that is the
poorest use to which a man can be put."</p>

<p>"It is strange, uncle, that you can not hear more
correctly. A man who shows so little of the infirmities

<!-- page 170 -->

of age ought to understand better than that."
I said this with the utmost gravity, and then laughed
heartily at the surprised look upon his face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>I said nothing about hanging the <i>man</i>: it was
the <i>minister</i> I spoke of. Did Eben Rockman die
when he crucified his ministership?"</p>

<p>"Why, puss!" said he, a light breaking over his
face: "I will own up; you have the start of me this
time. No, Eben Rockman did not die then, but became
a thousand times more alive."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, that is just what I intend to do with
Mr. Berrian, kill the minister to find the man; and,
if finding that Minnie Morris is my friend will do
the work, all the better."</p>

"Little woman, I am delighted: you are progressing
rapidly," said he, rising and walking back and
forth, as he generally did when under the influence
of strong feeling,&mdash;yes, always when conditions
would permit.<p>

<p>"Don't," said I, "or I shall be sure to spoil it all;
and then&mdash;&mdash; Would you like to hear the darky's
definition of progress, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly: better than any minister could give, I
presume."</p>

<p>"That is what I thought, sir, when I heard it; it
is this; If, when I'se little feller, I crawl up through
a little hole, and stays there till I get big, I can't get
back agin. Now, Uncle Rockman," I continued, "I's
the little feller; I's crawled up through the little
hole; but I haven't got big enough yet, but I might
be frightened back; please give me time to grow."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"The best sermon I ever heard! the best sermon
I ever heard!" he exclaimed. "O Father, I thank
thee that thou hast hidden these things from the
wise and prudent, and revealed them unto babes!
Child," he continued, turning to me after this ejaculation,
"that little story has done more to convince me
that I must adapt myself to people's conditions, if I
would benefit them, than all that you have ever said.
I am not in the least afraid of frightening you back;
but there are others who have crawled up, who do
not really know where they are; such need time to
grow."</p>

<p>"Here at seven," I said, glancing at the clock:
"well, make yourself comfortable, and excuse me,
for I must put things in readiness to give them a
right royal welcome."</p>

<p>"But I have not told you all," he said: "Minnie
has one of her boarders with her."</p>

<p>I must confess that I shrank. Minnie I had
learned to love: circumstances had placed her where
she must take advantage of them, or be crushed.
But she only boarded the girls; she did not sell herself.
True, I had been at her house, and talked with
the inmates; but that was quite a different thing.</p>

<p>Rockman was watching me: "Take care there, and
not slip"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down the hole," I laughed: "no, I will not: I
will welcome all who come with Minnie and Rose;
the inner life, the God within, may be untarnished,
no matter how defaced the external."</P>

<p>"Amen and amen." The sound followed me
down the stairs, as I went to make the desired

<!-- page 172 -->

preparation for my expected guests. As I moved
hither and thither, the words "made subject to
vanity, made subject to vanity," kept running
through my mind; but I could not place, could not
tell, where I had heard them.</p>

<p>"Uncle Eben," I called from the foot of the stairs,
"is there a passage in the Bible that speaks of being
made subject to vanity?"</p>

<p>"There is, little woman; and I have quoted it to
you in the past."</p>

<p>"I knew that I had heard the words somewhere,"
I said, "but I could not remember where: will you
give me the entire passage?"</p>

<p>I will, and tell you where to find it too. It
reads thus: 'For the creature was made subject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who
has subjected <i>the same</i> in hope,'&mdash;twentieth verse,
eighth chapter, of Paul's Epistle to the Romans: a
very good passage to think of if you wish to be
charitable to Lina Brown."</p>

<p>"Is that the name of the lady who is coming with
Minnie?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and sister of our old friend John Brown,
the carpenter."</p>

<p>I was all interest now; no more shrinking, but an
earnest desire to meet this to me new face, as well
as those I knew and loved. "What a difference a
little knowledge of one's history makes! If we
could look into the inner life of all, could see and
feel their joys and sorrows, as the 'dear God' does,
we should no longer be cold or uncharitable." It
was thus I mused, as I tripped to and fro; but there

<!-- page 173 -->

came a voice, I can not tell from whence: I only
know that it reached my inner consciousness, and it
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What of Robert Crandall?"</p>

<p>I struggled to include him in my charity, but it was
a hard task.</p>

<p>"Slipping back?" the voice still questioned. I
rallied, and replied, "Only holding on, give me time
to grow," when the bell rang, and I knew that my
friends had come. Forgetful of every thing but the
joy of the meeting, I rushed up stairs; and having
clasped both Rose and Minnie to my heart, I could
do no less than press a kiss upon the white brow of
the little figure who turned her eyes so appealingly
toward me, as I was introduced to "Miss Brown."</p>

<p>Uncle Eben was watching me; and the blessing his
eyes flashed upon me was a real benediction.</p>

<p>"We have been to tea," was the response to my
invitation to the dining-room.</p>

<p>"And why did you do that when you knew you
were coming here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Only hear her!" said Rose: "she would have had
us gone hungry for two mortal hours just for the
pleasure of feeding us herself."</p>

<p>"If it is two hours since you have eaten, I shall
not excuse you, miss; for, whatever the others might
do, I know that, with the prospect before you of
seeing me so soon, it was but precious little food
that you swallowed," I said.</p>

<p>"I guess there is but little to choose between us
on that score," remarked Minnie; "but our Lina's
cousin (glancing affectionately at Miss Brown)
would not let us leave without a cup of tea."</p>

<!-- page 174 -->

<p>"Come then, uncle, you too: no excuses," and we
were soon seated around the table, and if we did not
eat, we talked; and a portion of what I had prepared
disappeared somewhere; that is certain.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Morris, we will adjourn to the parlor,
and listen to your plans," said Rockman, when tea
was over.</p>

<p>"Not till these dishes are washed," replied
Minnie. She had noticed that I had no girl. "If
we are to be independent, self-sustaining, we must
lay no extra burdens upon others."</p>

<p>It was in vain that I protested: she would have
her way. "You take care of the food," she said to
me, "and, Rose, you put away the things, while Lina
and I wash and wipe the dishes;" and without a
moment's delay she pinned back her skirts, stepped
into the kitchen, took the dishpan from its place,
and went to work. I fell into the line marked out
for me; and in about as little time as it has taken to
tell it the work was done.</p>

<p>"There," said Minnie, "that is something of the
system that I intend to have in my 'Home of the
Sisters.' Come, we will go to the parlor now, and
talk about it."</p>

<p>" 'Home of the Sisters,' an appropriate name," I
thought as I led the way up stairs. Once seated,
Minnie glanced around upon us, and began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There have been many efforts made to assist the
Magdalen; good, well-meaning people have talked,
prayed, and worked to this end: but what have they
accomplished? Nothing, so to speak; and why?
Simply because they do not understand us. They

<!-- page 175 -->

label us, hold us up before the public as those who
need aid; but we must receive that aid humbly,
thankfully, with our faces in the dust. It does not
suit us; we rebel, and are cut off from sympathy.</p>

<p>"Now, I propose an entirely different plan. I propose
that there shall be no Magdalens, no outcasts,
but simply honest, self-sustaining women, who will
yield their love only as love is given in return.</p>

<p>"How will I make them self-sustaining, do you
ask? That is easy enough if there is a money base
to start with, and a determination to succeed. The
money base we have. There are ten of us combined;
enough to make a beginning. We have
planned for this end. The girls who were with me
at the capital, and those I have won over to work
with me since we left there; and that which was
raised by a tax on the people to pay senators, representatives,
and other State officers, has added largely
to this money base. They paid it to the girls for
their pleasure, and the girls saved it to free themselves.</p>

<p>"We have sold our jewelry, the most of it; also
our rich clothing. I have put all I have saved for
seven years into the fund, and we have fifteen thousand
dollars. Ten thousand of that is on interest at
ten per cent, which will bring us one thousand
yearly, as income."</p>

<p>"Using the money-god's weapon, interest, to cut
the lust-god's throat," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, or in other words to sever the chains of his
victims," she replied, and then continued, "We
have five thousand to commence work with. We

<!-- page 176 -->

might go into some business like keeping store, a
fashionable millinery, or something of that kind;
but I do not choose it. We want something that
will bring us into respectful social contact with men.
It is not good for man to be alone; it is not good
for woman to be alone. God never intended that
they should be separated; and he has planted a law
of life in woman's heart, that followed, free from
the money pressure to warp it from its legitimate
action, followed thus, will never lead to really evil
results."</p>

<p>"Your standard of morality would not be recognized
by the world," I said.</p>

<p>"Neither do we recognize theirs," was the response.
"We know theirs to be false, one which
they can not, and but few of them try to live by.
But we need say nothing of our standard, till by its
fruits we have demonstrated its value.</p>

<p>"But we ourselves can not live fully up to our
standard at first: we may so far as the spirit is concerned,
but we shall be obliged for a time to conform
somewhat to the letter of the old."</p>

<p>"I do not exactly understand what you mean," I
said.</p>

<p>She turned to me with, "Do you believe that the
legal tie without love constitutes marriage in any
true sense of that term?"</p>

<p>"I can not say that I do," was my unwilling reply;
for I saw where the logic of her reasoning was
leading me, and I did not like to follow.</p>

<p>" 'Love is the fulfilling of the law;' do you
remember that sermon?" asked Rockman.</p>

<!-- page 177 -->

<p>"I shall not be very likely to forget it, with you
before me, sir."</p>

<p>He smiled: "Don't fall through, child."</p>

<p>Minnie looked as though she did not quite understand,
and I gave an impatient toss of the head;
while she continued, "It is love, and not law, that
constitutes marriage; but in order to make ourselves
secure, should any of us find love's bonds upon us,
we shall demand the legal tie, or no public recognition.
So, you see, circumstances force us to put a
chain about our necks; will for a time, but not
always. The time will come when the world must
learn that love is the fulfilling of the law."</p>

<p>"But you have not told us yet what your plan
is," I said.</p>

<p>"True; well, it is this. My girls, all but Lina
here, are to be scattered through different portions
of the State, learning some useful trade. Some of
them have already found places; and others need but
little training, having been taught to work in early
life. This done, I intend to find some inland city,
one not intimately connected with the great thoroughfares,
and hire a double house for the double
purpose of having a place for my girls, and a place
to keep boarders.</p>

<p>"Lina and I will take charge of one-half of the
house, and we will board and lodge gentlemen, single
gentlemen. Rose here, and Uncle Rockman,&mdash;and
they would like to have you join them,&mdash;will
take the other half, and make it a lodging-house for
ladies who take in sewing, teach music, or some
other employment that may present; and I will
board them all.</p>

<!-- page 178 -->

<p>"You see, the ladies will lodge in one house, and
the gentlemen in the other. My girls are attractive,
and can make a home so agreeable that I shall have
no difficulty in keeping an equal number of gentlemen;
and I will invite them all into my parlor twice
a week, to spend the evening, and Rose will do the
same; so that four evenings will be used for social
life; and this, with what sociability we have at the
table, will so equalize the magnetic forces between
the sexes that there will be little or no excess, and
the lives of those who have existed on excitement
will be made tolerable; whereas those Christians who
attempt to save them make their lives intolerable."</p>

<p>"But how will the girls live when your money is
gone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not intend that our money shall be gone,"
she replied. "I can, or <i>we</i> can, get such a house as I
have named for eight or nine hundred dollars per
year; and ten boarders at five dollars per week,&mdash;those
who had the best rooms more, and the poorest
ones less, but average that,&mdash;ten boarders at that
price would be twenty-six hundred per year. I should
expect the girls to do the work, washing and all."</p>

<p>"For the gentlemen too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I could get it for them, and I know
I could; and many hands make light work. A
healthy, industrious woman would think it no great
task to cook, wash, and sew for herself and husband;
and where the work is done for twenty, instead of
two, the work will not be more than half as much in
proportion; and the girls can earn something outside
of doing their own work, and still have time for
study and recreation."</p>

<!-- page 179 -->

<p>"Study!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not? We intend to keep well informed
as to what is going on in the world; but, to
the money-question. We will suppose that the girls,
in various ways, earn fifty dollars each beside doing
the work I have named. That would be five hundred
dollars, or ten dollars a week. Now we will
suppose the rent nine hundred, fuel and food bought
at wholesale prices twelve hundred, two hundred for
loss on board-bills, and that would leave eighty each
to the girls for clothing; and recollect that we have
a thousand income beside, so I do not see much danger
of the money's being gone."</p>

<p>"There is only one thing about it that hurts me,"
said Rockman, "and that is the thousand dollars
interest-money. Who earns it? In the last analysis
it is the laborer."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Minnie, "but remember that we
are studying how to do away with this system of
interest; how to supersede it with something better.
It is not prostitution only that we are aiming to
destroy; that is but one branch of the tree of evil."</p>

<p>"We first make a platform of that which we aim
at destroying, in order to get a footing somewhere
else, before we kick it over," said Rose.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; well, I do not know as it is well to
ask too much at once, but I wish it could be otherwise,"
said Uncle Eben sadly.</p>

<p>Miss Brown&mdash;Lina, as Rose and Minnie called
her&mdash;said nothing, but her expressive face showed
the interest she felt.</p>

<p>"This is all very nice," said I, "as far as it goes;

<!-- page 180 -->

but what are ten girls saved, to the whole number
that need saving?"</p>

<p>"Do not imagine that I shall stop with ten; that
is only the beginning. Remember that we are a
band of sisters, each and all pledged to stand by one
another. There is heavy work to be done by and
by, and we shall be preparing for it. Do you suppose
there will be no thought in our parlor-meetings,
no questioning of the tendency of the present order
of things, no searching into the causes which produce
this hungering after stimulants, &amp;c.?</p>

<p>"I shall go out and bring in others as these get
the working of things, and shall see to it that two or
three of those best fitted to take the lead go into
another house, and take gentlemen to board, they
lodging elsewhere; and I will soon have ten girls in
the house, and ten gentlemen who only come to their
meals, and to the parlor-meetings once or twice a
week. Then I will start another upon a little different
plan, but giving woman the controlling power of
the home every time; and seeing to it that man provides
the means for both, while she does the work
for both."</p>

<p>"That is the way it is in society now, Minnie," I
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but with this difference: man controls the
purse; while, in the plan I propose, woman does it,
or enough, at least, to make her independent of
him."</p>

<p>"But suppose, Minnie, that your boarders fall in
love with the girls: what then?"</p>

<p>"If the love is mutual, it will be legitimate."</p>

<!-- page 181 -->

<p>"Marriage will take them out of your band of sisters,
however," I urged.</p>

<p>"Legal marriage will; but, realizing that love is
marriage, there need be no legal bonds unless the
parties desire it," she said.</p>

<p>"And what kind of salvation would that be?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It would be exchanging a condition in which
one was obliged to sell her person for bread, for one
in which mutual love was the only sanction for such
union; and, if you think that is no salvation, try
both," she replied with a bitterness in her tone,
which showed that she had some comprehension of
the difference. "No," she continued, "I have never
sold myself, but I have seen enough of it. I have
witnessed the anguish of those who have been forced
to it, and I know what love without legality is. It
is purity itself compared to the legal sales termed
marriage, which are consummated every day."</p>

<p>"But society will never recognize such unions," I
continued.</p>

<p>"Society need know nothing about it, if we are
true to each other; not at present, at least, and
remember, we are not dealing with society's members,
but with those whom she has cast out. We
are aiming to save such from utter degradation, and
society from the curse which such degradation brings
to it."</p>

<p>"And society will not thank you for snatching its
victims away from its capacious maw," said Rockman.</p>

<p>"But the victims will, Uncle Eben," said Rose.</p>

<!-- page 182 -->

<p>"Yes," added Minnie; "and when we have
enough of them saved, and they are taught to act in
concert, society will be glad to notice us."</p>

<p>"How will you make them do it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By proving that love is the fulfilling of the law;
by showing that justice, love, fraternity, and equality
form a fourfold cord that will protect its members
from outward assault," was her response.</p>

<p>"By their fruits ye shall know them, and the
fruits of love will be lovely; judged by such a rule,
are one-half the children we see upon the streets the
fruits of love?" asked Miss Brown.</p>

<p>It was the first remark she had made since we commenced
upon this subject; and I looked up in surprise,
while Mr. Rockman remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you do not say much, Miss Lina, you think to
some purpose."</p>

<p>"Judged by your standard, Lina," said Rose, "too
many of the children we meet on the street and elsewhere
would be counted the children of tiger-cats,
from the way they scratch and bite when angry."</p>

<p>"They teach me," said Rockman, "that human
nature is made of pretty good stuff: they are so
much better, the most of them, than I should think
they could be, considering conditions and surroundings."</p>

<p>"And I," I said, turning to Minnie, "must be
excused from joining in your plan, though I will
throw no impediments in your way, and will give a
home to any girl who really desires to reform; but I
want no half-way work. I was persuaded into going
to the Capital with you, but I can not consent to this."</p>

<!-- page 183 -->

<p>"You did not go to the Capital with me, my friend;
you went with Mr. Rockman and Rose," was her
quiet reply.</p>

<p>"But you were the master spirit in the planning,
Minnie."</p>

<p>"And I am able to be the master spirit in this: I
shall not shrink because some of my friends do not
see the work as I do."</p>

<p>"Stand by your colors, Miss Morris: I am with
you," said Uncle Eben; and then there was silence
till another subject was introduced, or, rather,
another branch of the same subject; to wit, woman's
relation to labor and capital, and the causes which
make her so dependent.</p>

<p>But the hour was getting late, and we soon separated
for the night. I went, however, to a sleepless
pillow. All night long, I turned over in my mind
Minnie's plans; and, the more I thought, the more
repulsed I became. "Deception, hypocrisy all the
way through," I said to myself. "If they were only
willing to come out and own what they have been,
and promise to do better, I would help them; but
now"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You want them to confess," said the inner voice.
"And why should they not be willing to appear in
their true colors?" I responded.</p>

<p>"Are you a Catholic?" the voice questioned again.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Don't believe in confessing to the priest, but
only to God?"</p>

<p>I was silent; and the same inward monitor continued,
"Then why ask these girls to make the great
public their priest, yourself among the rest?"</p>

<!-- page 184 -->

<p>"But what would become of society if marriage
was ignored?" I urged, not liking to yield the point.</p>

<p>"Who would marry these girls?" was the response.</p>

<p>"But some one might marry one of them, if they
go under false colors."</p>

<p>"And what of the men who have associated with
these girls? must they come out and give the world
their history to keep from marrying under false
colors?"</p>

<p>So the conflict went on, till I could almost imagine
that an unseen presence, a distinct personality, stood
by my bed, arguing the cause of the outcast with me.
In the morning I was worn, haggard almost; and
Minnie remarked it.</p>

<p>"I could not sleep," I said, "for thinking of your
plans. You know that I object to this underhanded
work, was not satisfied with it while we were in the
city, but the rest of you overruled me."</p>

<p>Miss Brown looked at me with shy brown eyes as
I said this, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What kind of prayers do you believe in?"</p>

<p>"What kind of prayers? I do not understand
you."</p>

<p>"If I was hungry, and you had plenty, which
would you do,&mdash;ask God to feed me, or do it yourself?"</p>

<p>"I should do it myself," I said.</p>

<p>"You believe in doing your prayers, then, instead
of saying them; well, that is the kind Miss Morris
believes in. But Jesus said, 'When thou prayest
enter into thy closet, and, when thou hast shut the

<!-- page 185 -->

door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
Father which seest thee in secret shall reward thee
openly.' "</p>

<p>I looked at her wondering why she should quote
that text of Scripture, and what application she
could make of it, when Rose came to my aid by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lina means that Minnie's plans are her prayers."</p>

<p>"And she expects to be rewarded openly; perhaps
she may, but I can not see any blessing to come out
of an effort to destroy marriage," I said.</p>

<p>"God ordained marriage, and man can not destroy
it; though he has tried very hard by insisting that
the legal shall supersede the real, whenever they
come in conflict," said Minnie with a quiet solemnity
that silenced me for the time.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">A CONSERVATOR OF PUBLIC MORALS.</p>

</div>

<p>AN hour or so after the conversation referred
to in our last chapter, Minnie,
Rose, and Miss Brown made preparations
to go out, and then I was in
trouble; for Minnie was so well known
in the city, that I feared she would be recognized,
and the neighbors would learn that she was visiting
at my house.</p>

<p>I had been very brave when Mr. Rockman told me
she was coming, and was ready to "hang the minister"
or any thing else that came in the way; but now the
actuality of facing the public as the friend and associate
of such a woman appalled me. "Such a
woman," said the same inner voice that I had contended
with the night before: "is she not really as
worthy as the most, if not all, of your acquaintances?"</p>

<p>I could but acknowledge that she was; but then,
<i>people did not think so</i>.</p>

<p>"People would not think it amiss, should you be
seen on the street with Robert Crandall: would you
think that a sufficient reason for associating with
him?" questioned this persistent invisible.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! nothing could induce me to give him
the least countenance," was my indignant response.</p>

<!-- page 187 -->

<p>"Then why not decide for yourself in one case as
well as in the other?"</p>

<p>But my trouble about the matter came to an end
by Minnie's appearing so equipped and disguised
that even I myself should not have known her, had
I seen her elsewhere. Her tall, straight form had
given place to a stoop; her hair had changed its
color; and her face, by the aid of cosmetics deftly
put on, looked at least fifteen years older than when
she left the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>I could only look my surprise; while she laughed,
and said, "You had all your trouble for nothing,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>I could not see my own face; but, judging by my
feelings, I must have flushed to the hue of scarlet.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said, seeing my embarrassment:
"it was only natural that you should wish to save
yourself from the fangs of Mother Grundy, for she
is a terrible creature; but we are so accustomed to
her blear-eyed criticisms that we can stand the ordeal
without flinching."</p>

<p>I turned to Rose; she was her own natural self.
"What if you should meet Robert Crandall?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Indeed, aunty, I should rather like it. I put him
down so nicely last winter, that I think he will be
glad to let me alone."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of it," I said; "for he has the
impudence of Satan, and the malice too. He will
make you suffer for that yet, I fear."</p>

<p>"I will risk him, with Minnie by my side," she
replied.</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>"But where are you going, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"Lina has a brother in the city somewhere, and
we are going to help her to find him."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you will be successful; but, oh,
dear! this state of things that requires constant
deception," I groaned.</p>

<p>When they were gone, I turned to Mr. Rockman,
and took up the subject of Minnie's plans. "What
do you think of them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think, child, that, when a class that has been
so wronged and trodden under foot get the idea
that they can help themselves, it is a hopeful sign."</p>

<p>"True; but do you think that she will be able
to accomplish any thing?"</p>

<p>"I do not think that her plans are perfect, but she
will learn by experience. She is made of the right
stuff, and when she undertakes a things she will not
be likely to yield readily," he said.</p>

<p>"But what good will it do, even supposing that
she makes a hundred or two self-supporting, outside
of the miserable traffic in which they are now
engaged? they will be but a drop to the bucket
compared to the entire number. If one could only
put a stop to the thing itself, it would amount to
something."</p>

<p>Eben Rockman looked at me without speaking,
till I fairly shrank into myself to get away from his
gaze. At length he drew a long breath, and said,
"If one of that number was your sister, or your
child, you would not say that. Do you know, have
you any idea, what prostitution is?</p>

<p>"I am a man, and can not be supposed to know

<!-- page 189 -->

what a woman feels; but I have seen women who
were so repulsive to me,&mdash;not ignorant, dirty,
degraded ones, but well-dressed, well-behaved,&mdash;I
have seen such, that, were I obliged to lie down in
their arms, I believe I should curse God and die to
escape such a doom. It is not so terrible a thing to
associate with one we love, one whose touch is
pleasure to us; the woman who believes she is
legally married is as happy as though she was really
so. It is the hated association, the repulsive embraces,
that make the curse of prostitution,&mdash;<i>is
prostitution</i>, for nature knows no other."</p>

<p>"I believe I should curse God and die to escape
such a doom." With what terrible earnestness he
uttered these words, and what a picture it presented
to my mind! I was a woman, and I knew what
this utter shrinking meant when felt towards the
legal mate, when felt where we are taught that it is
duty to yield; yet, strange to say, I had never before
looked at the Magdalen's life from this stand-point.
Not that I had never heard it spoken of, but I had
never been made to feel, to realize it. I shuddered
at the thought of such a fate for me or mine; but
somehow I had not sensed that the poor outcast was
of the same flesh and blood.</p>

<p>"Nature is true to herself," he continued; "and
that which she so repels is, must be, destructive. It
is this that kills those poor girls, fills them with
disease, makes them at last objects of loathing to
themselves and others. Suppose you were compelled,
day after day, to take the most loathsome
food into your stomach, or starve; mixed, perhaps,

<!-- page 190 -->

with that which was agreeable, but still the repulsive
must be taken; how long do you think you
could remain healthy?"</p>

<p>"Don't," said I, "the picture is too terrible; but
why will they remain there? it seems to me that
there must be some means of escape."</p>

<p>"Could you live wholly separated from your
kind?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I should not like to, certainly."</p>

<p>"Would you like to live among people who
looked down upon you, making you feel that you
were only tolerated through their charity, their
gracious generosity?"</p>

<p>"I do not think that I should stay among such
people long," I replied.</p>

<p>"And especially if you felt that you were just as
good as they were, but with this difference: they
had stolen a thousand dollars, and you knew it,
though you had no means of proving it on them,
and the world believed them honest; while, on the
contrary, you had stolen but a hundred, but had
been found out in your theft. Would you accept a
lower place beside such people, if they would consent
to tolerate you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would not. I might be content to
humble myself before the really good, but before
such hypocrites, never!" was my indignant reply.</p>

<p>The man seemed determined to put the case
before me from every possible standpoint; for he
continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You would feel more at home as an equal
among recognized thieves, than you would as a penitent
among unrecognized thieves?"</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p>"I should, yes."</p>

<p>"Madam, you have answered your own question,
as to why those poor girls stay where they are, why
they accept the condition and make the most of
it. Change the word thieves to violators of the
marriage-law, and the analogy is perfect.</p>

<p>"The world, the great pretentious, hypocritical
world, will never receive such as Minnie Morris as
an equal. It demands that they remain where they
are, or that they keep at its feet as penitents, begging
for the mantle of forgiveness, of charity, to be
thrown over them. And yet, were Minnie to go
into society, she would meet at almost every turn
those who had been her guests; who had used their
influence, their power, so far as their money and
their presence went, to hold her where she was.
And do you suppose that she will bow and stand
back before such?</p>

<p>"There is no hope for that class, for her and such
as she mingles with, only as they take the matter in
their own hands, and fight it out with the world;
for there is one thing that always commands respect,
and that is grit; the cool, persevering self-assertion
that refuses to submit to the wrong. I
repeat it, Minnie has started on the right track.
She will respect herself, and teach those who join
with her to do the same; and, the movement once
started, others will take it up; and in combination
they will be a power, one of the powers that will
aid in changing our present imperfect system of
things to something higher and better."</p>

<p>As I followed his argument, I felt that he was

<!-- page 192 -->

right; and yet I found myself rebelling against every
practical step in the direction indicated, till he
finally said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Child, your good name stands in your way: you
will never be an efficient worker till that is taken
from you. You look on and sympathize with the
wounded, but are so very much afraid that their
touch will stain your white robes, you dare not come
near to aid. When a sword pierces your own soul,
and the blood streams from thence, you will then
know that your garment is not <i>yourself</i>."</p>

<p>Prophetic words! but I did not think that I was
so soon to test them.</p>

<p>Minnie and her daughters, as she laughingly called
Rose and Lina, were gone about three hours. Lina
had succeeded in finding her brother, but he could
not invite her home on his wife's account: so he
would be here this evening, with my permission, and
talk with her a while.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said; "your brother seems like an
old acquaintance to me, though I have never spoken
with him. I used to watch him at work when he
was building the house next me."</p>

<p>"And did he build that house?" she asked, giving
it an affectionate look, as though his touch had
endeared it to her.</p>

<p>"The very embodiment of womanly trust and
love," thought I as I looked upon her.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Rose turning to me, "we did
meet Crandall, and he looked as though he would
annihilate me; but I do not think he had any idea
who Minnie was; for, just as he passed us, Lina called

<!-- page 193 -->

out, 'Mother, isn't that beautiful?' pointing to an
oil-painting which hung in a show-window of a large
picture-store.</p>

<p>"Oh! it was rich to see the black cloud which
settled down upon his honor's countenance; only he
makes me shudder when I come near him, as if I
had come in contact with some slimy reptile."</p>

<p>"I wish he had not seen you, Rose," said Rockman
quietly; but I detected an undertone of anxiety.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>"Look there!" said he, pointing across the street.</p>

<p>"He has tracked us home," said Rose.</p>

<p>"He means mischief," said I.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! what mischief can he do?" exclaimed
Rose; but yet she did not look quite satisfied.</p>

<p>"I am not so certain that he did not recognize
Minnie," said Rockman: "he knows her too well
to be readily deceived," glancing at the same time at
me in a way which showed that he had not expressed
his whole thought.</p>

<p>It was not necessary that he should, for I felt it
all through me. <i>My good name was gone!</i></p>

<p>Minnie as yet had said nothing, but her look
showed that she was thinking. "Did Robert Crandall
get an idea, last winter, that Rose had ever
been at my house in disguise, Mr. Rockman?" she
asked at length.</p>

<p>"I think he did: he accused Rose to me of being
your errand-boy the night I confronted him at the
ball; and I only laughed at him."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am sorry you did not tell me, uncle; for,

<!-- page 194 -->

had I known it, I should have taken care to have
kept her, as well as myself, entirely out of his way,
or have so disguised both, that neither would have
been suspected because of being with the other."</p>

<p>"Disguised! disguised! disguised!" I exclaimed
in a tone of vexation. "I am sick of this disguising:
one would think we were all a set of criminals."</p>

<p>"And so we are," said Minnie. "In the first
place, it is a criminal offence that we were born to
be women; in the second place, we were born slaves,
and have no right to our own bodies, only as the law
directs; consequently, a part of us have offended in
this direction; and, in the third place, it is against
the law for a woman to dress in male attire.</p>

<p>"Crandall knows this, and he holds a grudge
against us because we dared to deceive his honorship:
so he will make us trouble if he can. Rose, we
must get out of this."</p>

<p>"How, what?" said I, hardly knowing what I
did say.</p>

<p>"Lina can stay here: it is Rose and I that he is
angry with, and we must leave the city immediately.
Were I at my own home, and in my own
proper colors, I would meet and defy him; but, for
your sake, we must leave."</p>

<p>I was about to remonstrate, but she put her hand
upon my lips with, "Not a word;" and in a few
minutes she and Rose sped out of the back way, and,
hailing a passing hack, were soon at the depot and
aboard the train, which, had they been a moment
later, would have left them behind.</p>

<p>Rockman, after they left, did as he usually did

<!-- page 195 -->

under strong excitement,&mdash;walked the room with
rapid strides; and I sat down, and cried with anger.
Could I have had the handling of Crandall for
a while, I think he would not have been treated
very tenderly.</p>

<p>"Possess your soul in patience, little woman:
'the wicked shall not always triumph,' " said he at
length, coming and placing his hand on my head.</p>

<p>"But why need they triumph at all?" I asked.</p>

<p class="small">"God moves in a mysterious way<br/>

His wonders to perform:<br/>

He plants his footsteps in the sea,<br/>

And rides upon the storm."</p>

<p>"I have heard you repeat that before," I said in
no amiable tones.</p>

<p>"And you may hear me repeat it many times
more, for that old hymn of Watts's is one of the
grandest things in the English language."</p>

<p>"It may be grand to you, sir; but I prefer less
mystery and more justice." I had dried my eyes;
but the indignant blood was coursing through my
veins at unusual speed, and the look I wore was
any thing but that of submission; that is, if feelings
are any indication of looks; I did not consult the
glass. Just then the door-bell rang.</p>

<p>"It is Crandall with an officer," Rockman said.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I asked.</p>

<p>"God told me."</p>

<p>"I think God had better have told you before," I
snapped out.</p>

<p>"His ways are not like our ways: shall I go
down?"</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>The bell rang the second time with an impatient
jerk.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I will go," for I ached to give
Crandall "a bit of my tongue," as an Irishman
would say. I descended the stairs, and went quickly
to the door. I did not find Crandall, but a gentlemanly
looking man stood there.</p>

<p>"Is there a Miss Barron here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is not, sir."</p>

<p>"Has there been no such lady here?"</p>

<p>"There has; but she left in company with a lady
friend, about an hour since."</p>

<p>"Can you inform me, madam, where she went?"</p>

<p>"I can not, sir: she did not know herself just
where she should stop, but said she would write and
let me know."</p>

<p>He stood back a moment as if in thought, while I
drew back as if to close the door. "Madam," said
he, "I am sorry to trouble you, but I have a warrant
for the arrest of Miss Barron; she was seen to
enter this house, and has not been seen to leave
it."</p>

<p>"You can search the house, sir, as thoroughly as
you like; but I must first know of what my friend
Miss Rose Barron is accused."</p>

<p>"She is accused, as you will see by this warrant,
of wearing male attire at different times, and in
public places."</p>

<p>"By whom is this accusation made?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By the Hon. Robert Crandall, representative
from this district." I drew back.</p>

<p>"You can search as much as you please," I said.

<!-- page 197 -->

"But Robert Crandall will find that his prey has
escaped him this time; and he will not have the
opportunity of drugging her, as he did years ago."</p>

<p>I felt a warning touch, and, looking up, found
Rockman standing by me. "Be careful what accusations
you make," he whispered in my ear: "you may
be called upon to prove them;" then aloud, "Crandall
is out the back way watching," and for reply, I
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you please show this gentleman over the
house?"</p>

<p>Of course the search was fruitless; but I could
not sit quietly down and wait while the officer was
going over the house: so I walked out the back door,
went to the fence from whence I could look into the
street, and confronted Crandall with, "Are you at
the head of the moral police, sir?"</p>

<p>He looked at me with a sneer upon his face, but
made no reply. "Because if you are," I said, "I can
tell you where the nearest drug-store is, if you are
not supplied with that kind of moral suasion."</p>

<p>"Madam, if you think to divert my attention, and
so give your accomplices a chance to escape, you will
fail," he said with a lofty air of severity.</p>

<p>"And, if you think to set eyes on her you seek,
you will fail, for she is beyond your reach," I retorted.
"A nice law-maker you are! a splendid
conservator of public morals."</p>

<p>"Rail on, madam: the tongue of a woman of
doubtful reputation is no slander," he said, with a
leer that so fired me with indignation, that, had I
been in reach of a pistol, I should have tried my

<!-- page 198 -->

hand at ridding the earth of his presence. I felt
that I would be willing to die, could I look upon his
dead body first. Wicked, was I? wait, whoever you
are that read these lines,&mdash;wait till you have been
tried in a similar manner, before you condemn.</p>

<p>I controlled myself, however, for he should not see
that he had moved me; and the next words I
uttered were as calm as intense hate and intense
pride could make them.</p>

<p>"With you, sir, reputation is every thing; you
have no character to defend; honor, manhood, all
that is valuable, went long ago; poor fellow, I pity
you!" and, turning upon my heel, I left him looking
the image of concentrated rage.</p>

<p>"Pride and hatred,&mdash;poor weapons these to vanquish
an enemy with," I often think as I look back
upon that time. How much I needed growth!
How little I realized the spirit of the words, "Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do"!</p>

<p>That evening I sent for the Rev. Mr. Berrian, and,
upon his arrival, sat down in company with Eben
Rockman, and gave him the whole history of my
acquaintance with Rose, told him of her school-days,
of finding her afterward in the street in the condition
I had; of my acquaintance with Minnie,&mdash;in
fact, told him all without reservation; Mr. Rockman
supplying many links that I could not, he not having
told even me.</p>

<p>The looks of horror, the tears of sympathy, that
he gave to my recital, convinced me that, whatever
his prejudices as a minister might be, as a man he
had a heart that was true and tender. One week

<!-- page 199 -->

before, I could not have looked him in the face, and
told him all this; but the experience of the last few
hours had swept away, and for ever, all the barriers
of false modesty; and now the truth was of more
value to me than all else.</p>

<p>It was a terrible experience, but it brought me
eventually the richest boon of my life.</p>

<p>"And is there no way to reach this man?" asked
Mr. Berrian at length.</p>

<p>"None that I see, sir: he is rich and honorable,
and who would believe the story, were it given to
the public? a woman's word, if there can be even a
shadow thrown upon her character, no matter how
unjustly, is counted of but little worth."</p>

<p>"God help us to bear the bitter wrong, then!" he
said; his indignation, and what he believed to be
Christian submission, struggling for the mastery.</p>

<p>"God help us to do away with the causes which
produce such wrong!" was Rockman's response.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman looked at him in surprise.
"How can we reach the causes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By giving woman her rightful place beside man
as his equal, sir: she is a slave, now, is under man's
control, subject to his will. Man stands in the place
of God to woman, and what an idea he gives her of
the divine! Oh, heaven! I sometimes blush that I
wear a man's form!" and again the rapid strides
back and forth across the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Berrian's look said, "What kind of a man is
this?" and Eben, turning as though he had read the
thought, replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am one whose soul is linked to the souls of

<!-- page 200 -->

the suffering; so linked, that there is no rest for
me till their wrongs are righted. Their cause is
my cause; and neither height nor depth, things
present, nor things to come, can separate me from
them."</p>

<p>"Do you not use Scripture lightly, my friend?"
questioned Mr. Berrian.</p>

<p>"If God has written in my heart the same language
that is found in the book, I shall not give
preference to one over another, sir," was Rockman's
reply. And Mr. Berrian, finding a character that he
could not handle, made no further attempt to do so,
but, turning to me, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, I thank you for honoring me with your
confidence in this matter; and rest assured, that,
whenever it is in my power to serve you, I shall be
only too glad to do so," and then retired, and left
us to ourselves.</p>

<p>"You were right, little woman," said uncle, as
soon as he was gone. "Hang the <i>minister</i>, and there
will be a splendid <i>man</i> left; but, while the minister
lives to take the lead, the man is cast into the
shade."</p>

<p>"What is that you say about hanging ministers?"
asked Lina, coming into the room at the moment.</p>

<p>I laughed: "Uncle Rockman thinks that Mr.
Berrian is more of a man than he is a minister, and
he does not like the idea of the professional title
taking the precedence of the one who wears it: that
is all."</p>

<p>"And enough too. Why will men who profess to
follow Jesus take to themselves titles, allow themselves

<!-- page 201 -->

to be called rabbis, masters, reverends, when
Jesus directly forbade it? The Rev. Mr. Rockman,
the Rev. Mr. Berrian: away with such nonsense!"
said Eben.</p>

<p>"Men should be tender of babies, or cripples, Mr.
Rockman," said Lina in response to this outburst.
"Because you are strong, and do not need a title, a
staff, it does not follow that those who are weak
should be denied the support of one."</p>

<p>"A great support it must be to carry a title.
Why not say Carpenter Smith, Ditcher Brown, and
Ploughman Leslie? I am sure it is quite as honorable
to work at the trade that Jesus did, or to search
the bosom of mother earth, as it is to pore over the
pages of a book, about the meaning of which no
two can exactly agree. We know that a God-power
was necessary to the existence of the earth
and her products, but we are not so certain about
the other."</p>

<p>"Fie, fie. Uncle Rockman! I thought you believed
in the Bible."</p>

<p>"And so I do. Miss Lina; but, if I find more of
God outside of it than I do upon its pages, what
then?"</p>

<p>"I expect, uncle, that we must all take him
where we find him and as we find him," was her
reply.</p>

<p>"Well answered, little one: thou art not far from
the kingdom. Flesh and blood gave not to thee
the wisdom of that reply, but our Father in
heaven."</p>

<p>After a few days we heard from Rose and Minnie;

<!-- page 202 -->

and, as soon as it was practicable, Mr. Rockman and
Lina went to them.</p>

<p>"We need a man with us," wrote Minnie, "to aid
us in our plans. Men are dreadful beings, but a
woman needs one as a protector; that is, if she is
within the pale of respectable society; but if her
reputation is dead, and she is cast out of the temple,
then men, like carrion crows, become her dissectors,
while women stand afar off and hold their noses.</p>

<p>"There are exceptions to this, as you, my friend,
and Eben Rockman, have proved to be true of your
own selves; but, if the buzzards do not tear you
somewhat before this thing is through with, then I
am mistaken. By the way, one of the ladies who
will be with me when we get settled is now in
Omaha; and I mailed her a letter yesterday inclosing
one to Robert Crandall, and asked her to re-mail it
from there to him. Wouldn't it be funny if he
should start for California soon?"</p>

<p>"Crandall is too old a bird to be caught in that
way," said Rockman as he read this; "and they must
not stay where they are another day."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Crandall, I have no doubt, will get either the
postmaster or the carrier to give him the post-mark
of our letters."</p>

<p>I settled back in my chair with a gasp. "Are heaven
and earth combined against us?" I managed to
say at length.</p>

<p>"No; but hell is; and hell rules this earth just
now, while God's kings and queens must hide from
the face of him who sitteth on its accursed throne.
Get me pen, ink, and paper."</p>

<!-- page 203 -->

<p>I did as he requested; and, hastily dashing off a
letter, he took his hat, and went out. "Look for me
when I come," he said as he closed the door after
him; and I did not see him again for two weeks.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, almost to the minute, he
walked in again. I then learned that he had gone
five miles on foot the night he left, mailed his letter
to Minnie, and then had taken the midnight express,
and gone twenty miles in the opposite direction, to
the point at which she was to reply. And so for the
entire time he had been changing here and there,
giving no clew by which he could be traced.</p>

<p>"Is all this necessary?" I asked. "One would
think you were a criminal hiding from justice."</p>

<p>"And so I am,&mdash;from the justice that pursues my
criminal folly. I made a very great mistake, when,
for the satisfaction of seeing Crandall's chagrin at
being deceived and defeated, I took off my disguise;
and through that he learned the part Rose had been
playing.</p>

<p>"He swore then that he would have his revenge,
and he is a perfect bloodhound on track."</p>

<p>"I could wish you had not done so," I said, "but
that would not change matters now; and I think I
should have done the same; indeed, if I remember
right, I urged you on. I felt as if my winter at the
capital would be wasted, if I could not see him put
to shame."</p>

<p>"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith the
Lord," he repeated to himself.</p>

<p>"I believe it," I said; "and if I had left him to
God, instead of trying to take his punishment into

<!-- page 204 -->

my own hands, I should have saved myself a great
deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, do not grieve over it; good will come out
of it somehow. The wrath of man shall praise him,
and the remainder of that wrath he will restrain.
Minnie has found a place to locate,&mdash;a much better
one she says, than where she stopped first; and I
shall go to her next week; but I must not write to
you here, neither must she; and how shall we communicate
with you?"</p>

<p>"I think I can manage it," I said. "I will ask Mr.
Berrian to let you write me, and inclose it to him;
and when I write I will direct to Lina as Mrs. L. W.
Brown, and mail it at some other office."</p>

<p>"That will do for the present," he replied; "but
are you not presuming on Mr. Berrian's kindness?"
casting upon me a look that brought the blood to my
cheeks.</p>

<p>In the mean time Robert Crandall had called upon
Mr. Berrian, stating that he had the pleasure of listening
to him the sabbath before, and expressed a
desire for a better acquaintance. Of course, the
<i>minister</i> could do no better than to treat him
kindly. The <i>man</i> would have shaken him off
like the slimy serpent he was; but the minister ruled
the man as yet.</p>

<p>Not a word of Rose Barron, nor of Minnie Morris;
though he had learned from Minnie's letter that it
was she that had defeated him by taking Rose out
of his reach. The next sabbath Crandall attended
Mr. Berrian's church again; and this time I was
there. Mr. Berrian came, at the close of the service,

<!-- page 205 -->

and shook me warmly by the hand, asking after my
health, and saying that he had missed my face.</p>

<p>Robert Crandall, with his haughty wife, stood but
a few feet away, and not a muscle of his face showed
that he saw me; but, as the minister moved on, he
stepped forward, and introduced Mrs. Crandall, and
together they passed out of the church. Mr. Berrian
looked back to where I was standing, and his
face showed, to me at least, that he was not pleased
with his company; but Crandall managed in such
a way that he could not break away without being
rude.</p>

<p>There was a flutter of pleasure in the congregation,
for Mr. Berrian was deservedly popular, and
his people liked to have him appreciated; and the
Hon. Mr. Crandall and lady were quite an accession
to their ranks. Of course it was their minister who
drew these notables. Simple souls! they had no
thought that there could be any other reason.</p>

<p>The next day, but quite late in the day, as though
he had put off a disagreeable task as long as possible,
Robert Crandall called upon the Rev. Mr. Berrian
again; and after discussing the weather, the sermon,
&amp;c., there was a pause: finally Crandall remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see, Mr. Berrian, that you are acquainted with
the lady who lives next house to what is called
Wellby's Row; nothing more than a speaking acquaintance,
I presume?"</p>

<p>"I have called there a few times," Mr. Berrian
replied quietly.</p>

<p>"Indeed! I am not surprised at all, for I met her
in society last winter several times, while at the capital,

<!-- page 206 -->

though she does not seem to go out much here:
yet I have always supposed her to be a respectable
woman; but we never know who we are going to
meet in this world of sin."</p>

<p>"Please explain yourself, Mr. Crandall."</p>

<p>"I feel it my duty to do so, sir, though I should
be glad to avoid it if I conscientiously could; but
you, as a minister, ought to know of this matter.
Well, to make the disagreeable story as short as possible,
years ago I met with a beautiful, and I supposed
at the time an innocent girl. It was before
I was married, and I was quite attracted to her.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, however, I learned her character
before it was too late. Well, last winter, just before
the close of the legislature, I met this same girl at a
public ball, and under the care of the lady we are
speaking of. I was surprised, shocked, that our
wives and daughters could not go into company
without meeting with such characters.</p>

<p>"But this is not all. I learned afterward, and
from reliable sources, that this same girl had spent
the most of the winter at the house of a notorious
character by the name of Minnie Morris: she is
well known in this city. Well, only two or three
weeks since, this girl and this woman, with another
one of the same style, and an old man who spends a
great deal of his time with them, came to this city,
and stopped with the woman in question several
days. Indeed, I believe that the man and one of the
girls have but just gone."</p>

<p>"And you know these things to be true?" asked
Mr. Berrian, looking Crandall full in the face.</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"If I did not, I should not come and tell you,
sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"It was all I could do," said Mr. Berrian to me
afterward, in talking about it, "to so restrain myself
as to keep from revealing to the smooth-faced hypocrite
the fact that I had some previous knowledge
of what he was telling me; only that it bore quite a
different light to what he had given it. As it was, I
sat for a while as if in troubled thought (which was
true), and then rising, I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Mr. Crandall, it is well that you have told me
this: it is not pleasant work; but, as a servant of
Him who was the friend of publicans and sinners, I
feel that he brings to me such as he desires me to
benefit, and I shall try to do my duty.'</p>

<p>"He looked as though I had not taken the subject
quite in the way he hoped, but was too politic to
say so; and, with a hope that I should be able to
accomplish the good I desired, he bade me good-evening."</p>

<p>"How did you feel," I asked, "when he was telling
you all this?"</p>

<p>"I felt as though I was in the presence of Satan,"
was the vehement reply.</p>

<p>I laughed in spite of myself, and he looked up
inquiringly; so I told him of our conversation in
reference to the man and the minister, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"You think the minister is growing weak," he
interrupted, and laughed so heartily that I joined in
his merriment without restraint.</p>

<p>The next sabbath, Crandall and his wife were
again at church; and again they made an effort to

<!-- page 208 -->

monopolize the minister, but did not meet with quite
as much success as on the previous Sunday. Mr.
Berrian took even more pains than usual to show me
the friendship and respect he felt; which was of
course gratifying to me, or would have been but for
the fear that he was injuring himself.</p>

<p>I knew, by the cold looks cast upon me from other
quarters, that the poison had begun its work; the
minds of the people were being prejudiced against
me. And as the choking, smothering atmosphere
thus generated inclosed me round, I thought,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If, with conscious rectitude to sustain me, this is
so hard to bear, I do not wonder that the wronged
and forsaken woman shrinks from contact with, or
hardens herself to defy, when forced to meet it."</p>

<p>The next sabbath Crandall came in alone; and a
party near me said loud enough for me to hear,
glancing at him as he took his seat, "He says he
can not bring his wife here so long as that woman
comes."</p>

<p>I knew very well who "that woman" was; and
but for Crandall's presence I should have left the
house then, such a crushing sense of injustice came
over me. Fool that I was, to make him of enough
account to have it affect my course of action!</p>

<p>I was too proud, however, to let him see that I was
in the least moved. I did not see then that I was
belittling myself: I had not grown big enough for
that. I did not wait, though, to speak with Mr.
Berrian; and I thought then that it was on his
account. I would save him; but I am now satisfied
that it was on my own. I could not have met his
kindly gaze without tears.</p>

<!-- page 209 -->

<p>Upon going home, and thinking the matter over, I
resolved that I would leave the city; for I saw, that,
let what would come, Mr. Berrian would stand by
me; and I felt quite sure that such a course would
result in his losing his place, and that I did not wish.
I knew where I could sell my house; for Wellby had
tried to buy it when building the last house on his
block, and he had asked me to let him know if I
ever wanted to dispose of it.</p>

<p>So the next day, when Mr. Berrian rang my bell,
I was out on business; and he got no response. "I
guess he would have rung all day, if I had not told
him you had gone out, madam," said the Irish girl
from the next yard on my return.</p>

<p>"And sure he's a fine gentleman, if he is a Protestant
priest, and more's the pity," she continued. I
thanked her for telling the gentleman I was out, and
hastened to my room to have a good cry. This luxury
over, I commenced to pack my trunks, and to get
things ready generally for removal. It was a hard
task, but it had to be done. The next morning I
was off again to complete the sale of my house by
getting the papers all ready for the signatures; but I
told Wellby that I had particular reasons for keeping
matters quiet, and that I would not sign the
papers till the last minute; and, if he told any one
of the matter, I would not sign them at all.</p>

<p>He seemed a little curious to know why I desired
this, but I did not enlighten him; and he was only
too glad to get the place, to spoil his chance by
talking about it where I did not wish. When I
came home this time, Bridget handed me a note

<!-- page 210 -->

over the fence; and upon opening it I found these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>MRS. &mdash;&mdash;, This is the second time I have called, and you
away. You need not think to escape me thus; and, if I do
not find you to-morrow, I shall wait on your doorstep till you
return. Gossip does not frighten me.</p>

<p>Respectfully your friend,</p>

<p>A. BERRIAN.</p>

</div>

<p>"Well," said I to myself, "I will meet you once
more; but, as to remaining here to test your friendship,
I will not. I can suffer alone, but I shall not
stay and drag you down."</p>

<p>He came; and we had a long and pleasant talk,
each avoiding that which was most on the mind, to
wit, Crandall and the slime of his oily tongue; but
on leaving he said playfully, and yet I knew that he
meant it, "Now, don't run off next sabbath, till I
have time to speak with you; for if you do I shall
follow you home."</p>

<p>"Then if I am there, I will wait; for that would
never do for a minister," I replied.</p>

<p>"If you are there?" he repeated, looking at me
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes," I laughed, for he must not suspect, "if I
am there; something might happen to detain me."</p>

<p>I remained at home that day, and the next till
toward evening: then I called on Wellby, had the
papers all properly signed and attested, told him that
I should go on the midnight express, but would leave
the keys with the hackman to be given to him the
next morning. I then had a drayman take what I
wished to sell to the auction-rooms, and, instead of

<!-- page 211 -->

going on the train I had named, took the one half an
hour earlier, and went in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Thus was the home of years broken up; thus did
I flee away by night like a criminal, and for what?
Simply because my heart had ruled my head in my
course toward the wronged ones that circumstances
had brought me in contact with. Woman's reputation
is so delicate, that if she dares to befriend a sister
who has been deceived, betrayed, she, too, must be
branded with the mark of Cain.</p>

<p>Robert Crandall, under pretense of caring for the
public morals, had raised the indignation of the
neighborhood against me to that degree, that, had I
remained, I should have been subject to indignity if
not violence; for it had been represented that I kept
a decoy-house, was in league with Minnie Morris,
aiding in furnishing victims for her use.</p>

<p>Of course their daughters were in danger, and
their sons liable to be led astray: why should they
not be aroused, indignant?</p>

<p>Still I should have staid, and faced the storm, but
for the minister. He would stand by me; and he
must not suffer on my account. You will say that
Mr. Berrian was a man, as well as Robert Crandall;
and why could not one man compete with another?
A minister is supposed to have a great deal of influence.</p>

<p>I thought of that; and the only answer that came
to me was, "Ministers, like women, are owned.
The church, the congregation, own the minister,
support him, and, so long as he comes up to their
standard, it is well. There is a higher type of morality

<!-- page 212 -->

required of him than of the masses, and a higher
morality required of woman than of man: consequently
both the woman and the minister are enslaved;
for, if the people can be made to believe that
the standard has been marred, there is no hope for
them."</p>

<p>So the woman fled to save the minister; and the
man of the world, the smooth, politic, hypocritical
man, prevailed.</p>

<p>"You are too excitable," said a friend to me years
ago; "you need to be more cool, calculating"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Devil," I burst forth; and in my mind the three
words have become so associated, that, where I find
the two first in any great degree, it makes me fear
that I shall find the last also.</p>

<p>The continued, persistent self-possession of a
friend distresses me.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">FIVE OF THE TEN.</p>

</div>

<p>AS the reader will doubtless infer, I went,
when driven from my home, to the home
that Minnie had prepared for herself
and friends,&mdash;another evidence, those I
left behind me would have said, had
they known of it, that I was just what Crandall represented
me to be.</p>

<p>I found, upon reaching the place, that Minnie had
changed her plans somewhat; and, instead of leasing
two houses together, she had bought two, one on one
side of the town, and the other nearer the central
portion. She had found a thriving inland town of
some ten thousand inhabitants, where property was
not unreasonably high; and by doing this she could
secure a greater degree of variety for the girls, each
home forming its own circle of acquaintance, and
then intermingling with each other as visitors.</p>

<p>It gave, also, a better opportunity for remunerative
employment. The reader will recollect, however,
that their interests were one. They were a band of
sisters, pledged to stand by each other, to divide the
last crust, if need be; so that the doom which society
accorded them, that of wearing sackcloth the rest of
their lives, or selling their bodies for bread, might be
escaped.</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>I purchased the third house, and then we each had
a threefold home. They boarded gentlemen only, and
lodged no one outside of their own. Their boarders
were generally those who neither drank, chewed, nor
smoked. (This was not made an absolute condition,
but they were given to understand that such were
preferred.) And those who were the victims of these
habits either left them off or went elsewhere.</p>

<p>But they (I did not take boarders, but aided otherwise)
made things so pleasant that but few left. It
was understood at each home that all, inmates and
boarders, were invited to spend an evening each
week at each of the other homes; so we went out
twice, and received company once at each place.
Music, select readings, games, and whatever else we
could think of that was either instructive or amusing,
filled up the time.</p>

<p>Sometimes we would all join and go to some place
of public amusement, which gave subjects for comment
or conversation afterward.</p>

<p>I had been there some three months when I said
to Minnie that I should like to know the history of
those girls, to hear what it was that first led them to
the brink from which society had cast them down.</p>

<p>"They will tell you," she said; and so, the next
afternoon, five of the original ten gave me their stories,
a short history of the steps taken to bring them
where they were when Minnie came, and, like an
angel from heaven, whispered the word "Hope" in
their ears.</p>

<p>The names of the five were Irene Bradley, Dora
Fenn, Sarah Blackman, Helen Myres, and Mary Bliss.</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>Irene was tall and fair, and, as poets would say,
had blue eyes and golden hair, though her hair was
too dark for that appellation. She was as graceful
in her movements as the willow, and looked as pure
and sweet as the lily. And yet she had walked in
the paths of sin, and the world had counted her lost.</p>

<p>She began with, "I was the youngest of seven
children, and the place of my birth a lovely valley
between two of the highest of a range of hills in old
Vermont. Three of us died in childhood; and the
two oldest, both sons, married and settled in the
neighborhood; leaving only myself and my sister
Julia, two years older, at home.</p>

<p>"Deacon Bradley, my father, was noted for his
stern rectitude of character, and his orthodox views.
It might be said of a truth that he feared God; but,
that love and trust are compatible with such fear, I
do not believe. The frown of an angry God seemed
ever before him, and mirth he regarded as a sinful
mockery of the awful majesty of heaven.</p>

<p>"My mother, I think, was naturally the reverse.
In a different atmosphere, I doubt not, she would
have been a sunny, happy woman; but this had long
since been crushed out of her, or, at least, so suppressed
that it never manifested itself in my father's
presence. But this element, so repressed in my
mother, took its revenge by giving us, Julia and I, a
double portion. Mirth, laughter, song, was as natural
to us as the air we breathed.</p>

<p>"Poor mother! how hard she strove to keep us
from manifesting it in father's presence! and how
often and how severely she was reprimanded because

<!-- page 216 -->

she failed! As we grew older, we saw how much
trouble it made her, and we were more careful when
father was by; but it was like damming the flowing
stream: when the waters rose high enough, they
would overflow. We used to talk about it nights
after we went to bed; we could not, we would not,
stand it so; we would break this bondage, or do something
desperate.</p>

<p>"Finally Deacon Smith's only son, and only child
also, asked father for permission to address Julia.
He was very pious, and, being the heir, would, when
the deacon his father concluded to step out, be rich;
and, of course, father was pleased. It was a greater
blessing than he had ever dared to expect for his sinful
child.</p>

<p>" 'I do not love him one bit,' said Julia to me; 'but
he is not bad looking, and I suppose I must marry, or
always remain cooped up here; so I guess I'll take
him. I wish, Irene, that you could live with me, and
get out of this.'</p>

<p>"I said nothing, but I intended to get out of this.
I had met a handsome city youth down at Aunt Mabel's
a few months before, and he was coming soon to
ask me of my father; for so he had promised. I had
not whispered this even to my sister, for there was a
possibility of his being false; I had heard of such
things, and, in that case, I could not bear even a sister's
pity.</p>

<p>"But he came, and my father questioned him as to
his religion. If that was right, why, all else was supposed
to be. Oh, horror! his parents were Methodists,
and he was not a member of any church. 'Give my

<!-- page 217 -->

daughter to the son of a Methodist class-leader!
Never! I would rather bury her.'</p>

<p>"Henry told me the result of this interview with
my father, and begged me to elope with him. This I
did not like to do, and probably should not have
done, had not my father heaped reproaches on my
head for encouraging 'such a reprobate,' as he was
pleased to call Henry.</p>

<p>"This so aroused me that I resolved to be free
from the tyranny I was under, let what would be
the consequences; so I went with my handsome lover
to the neighboring State, and we were married. This
done, Henry plead for a few months of secrecy, so
as to get his business in a little different shape, telling
me the whys and wherefores, till I was convinced it
was for the best, and so consented.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mabel, mother's only sister, lived close to
the State line; and under the excuse of visiting a
young friend some three miles distant, and a 'perhaps
I shall stay two or three days,' I stole away to meet
Henry. I remained away two nights, and then returned
to aunt's alone, with the pledge that in three
months my husband would claim me openly.</p>

<p>"Henry had a sister some three years younger than
himself, to whom he confided his secret; and she came
to see me the day before I returned to my father's,
and we talked the matter over. She seemed well
pleased with me, as, indeed, I think she was; but
the love of money makes fiends of people, I sometimes
think.</p>

<p>"About a week before I was expecting Henry, she
came again, and stole my marriage-certificate from

<!-- page 218 -->

me, at the same time telling me that Henry was not
very well, and I need not be surprised if he did not
come for me quite as soon as I expected.</p>

<p>"No, he was not much sick, she said, but was
not able to get along with his business as fast as he
had hoped to do.</p>

<p>"The very next day after she left, I learned that
he was dead, was buried the day before she left home.
There were three of the children, another brother and
this sister, beside Henry; and, when he found that he
was going to die, Henry had told his brother also of
his marriage. The business that he sought to accomplish
had been completed; and he had secured a certain
portion of his father's estate to himself by signing
away all claim to any thing further at his father's
death.</p>

<p>"This made him independent, though it gave him
much less than would have been his had he waited to
share equally with the other children. His brother
knew that if the marriage was proven, and I should
bear a child, that child would hold his father's property;
otherwise it would go back into the family,
his father being the next heir; so he sent his sister
down to find out if there was any prospect of my
becoming a mother, and, if so, to get from me the
proof of our marriage.</p>

<p>"When I heard of Henry's death, I fainted. My
father was present, and, I think, began to suspect
that there was something that he did not understand.
When I came to, he questioned me; and then, for
the first time, I missed my marriage-certificate. In
my desperation I told him all, for I felt a wild hope,

<!-- page 219 -->

that he would take some step to prove my marriage,
and thus save me from the disgrace that would
otherwise come upon me; but I was mistaken.</p>

<p>"I had disobeyed him, and there was no pity in his
heart for me. He refused to believe that I had been
married; said that, if I would deceive in one thing,
I would in another; and calling me a reprobate, a
child of the Devil, he turned me from his door, and
bade me never to enter it again. I think my mother
believed my story, and I know that Julia did; but
neither of them dared to defend me, though they did
for me what they could in secret.</p>

<p>"Well, I will not dwell upon the agony, the
shame, of the next few months. Suffice it to say
that my baby died, and I in my desperation took to
the only life that seemed open to me; everywhere
else I was treated with scorn, but with the world's
outcasts I could meet on equal footing; and, if there
is a hell upon earth, it is to be surrounded by and
obliged to mingle with those who scorn or pity you,
or both; I mean the pity that is born of scorn, a
scornful pity. It is terrible."</p>

<p>"Religious prejudice, and heirship of property,"
said Rockman at this point.</p>

<p>Irene looked at him as if to gather his meaning
from the expression of his face.</p>

<p>"They were the two forces that caused your woe,
and both accursed," he continued.</p>

<p>"I can not see how the heirship of property is
wrong," she remarked.</p>

<p>"And yet if Henry had not been worth a cent,
or if at his death his property had gone into a public

<!-- page 220 -->

fund to be used for the support of all fatherless
children, there would have been no inducement for
his sister to have stolen your marriage certificate,
and you would thus been saved all the disgrace,
except that which arose from religious prejudice."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rockman, I never thought of it in that
light before," she replied; "but you are certainly
right so far as the effect was concerned."</p>

<p>"To be sure, I am; and by what right are relatives
who have enough and to spare, made heirs of
the property of those who chance to be of their
blood, so said, when widows and orphans without
number are needing it? The selfish right of family
clanship, and among those who claim to be Christians
too. Let those Christians who are so anxious
to have God honored by this government honor him
themselves by making it obligatory upon church-members,
that all who are worth above a given sum
shall not hold inherited wealth, but put it into a
common fund for the benefit of the widows and
orphans in the county where they reside.</p>

<p>"Let them do this, being no respecters of persons,
but, like the God they say to worship, share this
fund equally with all who need it of the classes
named; and then see how many children would
become bitter enemies in quarreling over a dead
parent's money. See how many lawyers' fees would
be paid to decide who should have it; see how
many sickly children would be left to die of neglect,
or murdered by slow poison, or killed by accidents
done on purpose, that rich relatives may become
richer thereby.</p>

<!-- page 221 -->

<p>"Why, I sometimes think that such a change in
our laws, or even in church policy, would do more
to abolish crime than all that all our ministers are
doing now. Society, as it is at present constructed,
is one great tempting machine; and if single men,
or men with wives and without families, knew that
what they gathered together would go, in case of
their death, to all the needy women and children
within their town or county, such knowledge would
lead them to take more interest in such as were
liable to become their heirs; it would be a bond of
love between them, that would bless all concerned."</p>

<p>"Uncle Eben, I wish you could be our law-maker
for a time," I said.</p>

<p>"And I would prefer that people should make
just laws for themselves. The Lord's Prayer teaches
us to say, 'Lead us not into temptation;' and I would
not like to try how much temptation, in the shape of
power, I could bear; I am but human."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "we will talk of this matter more
fully at another time. I want to hear Miss Fenn's
story now."</p>

<p>"I have not much to tell," replied Dora, "and
yet you may think it considerable. My father was
an Episcopalian minister; and no Presbyterian or
Baptist of the old school could be more strict. I
had no childhood in any true sense of that term.
When fifteen years of age, I met a man much older
than myself, that I fell desperately in love with. I
think my manner toward him must have shown him
the state of my heart; for he said to me one day,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Miss Dora, I would not wrong you for the

<!-- page 222 -->

world; and your father with his strict ideas of
things would never give you to me.'</p>

<p>"I think I must have been what the world calls
reckless; for I looked him in the face, and asked,
'And would you have me if he would give me to
you?'</p>

<p>"He looked surprised, but replied, 'It would not
be hard to love you; indeed, I hardly know how one
could help doing so.'</p>

<p>" 'Then I will be my own mistress long enough to
give myself to you,' I said.</p>

<p>" 'But you are under age, dear child, and I can not
marry you without your father's consent, unless I
steal you, and leave the State.'</p>

<p>" 'I will steal myself, and leave the State, then,'
I said, 'even if I have to steal the money to go with,
for I will not stay here; I had as lief be in prison.'</p>

<p>"He sat for some time in silence. I think he must
have been weighing the chances of my doing something
desperate if left to myself; at length he asked,
'Do you love me, Dora?'</p>

<p>" 'I do, sir,' I said.</p>

<p>" 'Come here, and let me take your hands in mine;
now look me in the face, and tell me why you love
me,' said he.</p>

<p>"I did so, and replied, 'It is because I can breathe
freely where you are. I feel free and light as a
bird.'</p>

<p>"He bent his dark eyes upon me, and I shrank
abashed beneath their gaze. At length he said, 'It
shall be as you say, little one,' adding, as if to himself,
'it will be the only way to save you.' I was

<!-- page 223 -->

too happy to take in the full import of his words;
and that night I left my father's house, and became
the wife of Arnold Greyson. He was old enough to
have been my father, but I did not care for that. I
was as happy as the day was long."</p>

<p>"What of your mother? did you never think of
her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! I forgot to tell you," she said, "that my
mother died when I was but ten years old, and I
had a second mother who had one child of her own
by a previous marriage, and one by my father; and
she seemed to care but little for me further than to
complain to my father of what she called 'my waywardness.'
So you see, I was not missed much at
home. My husband was not a man of property, and
at the end of a year he was killed by an accident;
and I was left penniless.</p>

<p>"I was but a child, only sixteen years of age, and
had never been taught to work; and I was helpless.
The lady with whom we boarded wrote to my father
stating the condition I was in, and asked him to take
me home. This he refused to do, saying that I had
made my bed: I must lie on it. This cold reply
aroused the lady's indignation; and she told me to
stay with her till something better could be done,
uttering at the same time an invective that was
neither polite nor elegant against ministers in general
and stepmothers in particular.</p>

<p>"After a little, an opportunity offered, and I
studied for the stage; there temptation beset me on
all hands, and I did not try very hard to resist; so I
was soon counted an outcast; but I do not think myself

<!-- page 224 -->

so much worse than thousands of others whose
only advantage over us is in not having been found
out. I think a woman who, as Irene's sister did,
marries just for a home, is just as much of a prostitute
as one who sells herself otherwise; it is a sale
in one case as much as in the other. The difference
is only the Government stamp upon a counterfeit
marriage."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Irene; "and the woman who thus
sells herself in marriage is very likely to have a
lover outside of marriage. My sister would not dare
to invite me to her home, or to speak to me on the
street in the presence of her husband or any one who
knew who I was; and yet I have often helped to
shelter her and her lover. For my part, I should
prefer to live an outcast and done with it, to being
in constant fear of detection."</p>

<p>"Those who have no character have none to
lose," said Rockman.</p>

<p>"And none to worry over," she continued: "so
whatever of goodness one has is natural, spontaneous."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you leave the life you led, and
come with Minnie?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! to help her carry out her experiment. I
wanted to see if the world, and especially the Christian
world, would let us be <i>respectable</i>, I am satisfied
in my own mind that it will be no longer than they
get some hint of our past."</p>

<p>Miss Blackman here remarked, "You call both of
these ladies Miss, while, according to what they tell,
they should both be Mrs."</p>

<!-- page 225 -->

<p>"How is this, ladies? You both gave me your
maiden names, and I have called you by them," I
said. They both laughed.</p>

<p>"We have neither of us given you our real names,
neither do we intend to do so. We are not anxious
to have people trace us out, and connect us with those
who would be ashamed to acknowledge relationship;
some of them do not even know that we are living,
and would much prefer that we were dead, even if,
according to their theories, we were in hell: they
would prefer even this to having us around to disgrace
them."</p>

<p>"And for that very reason I would be around and
disgrace them all I could," said Sarah Blackman, her
eyes fairly flashing.</p>

<p>They all looked up, and Minnie said, "You are a
spunky piece, Sarah."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, and I am glad of it. It was revenge
that drove me to a life of shame; and, if my father
was living, I would be there yet. If I had a thousand
bodies, I would lay them all upon the altar if I
could by the means kill, and forever, that kind of
respectability that is preferred before human happiness."</p>

<p>"It seems to me a strange kind of revenge," I
said.</p>

<p>"I know it, but it was all that was left me. My
parents were rich and proud, and more especially
my father. I was their only child, and they desired
to make a brilliant marriage for me. The man of
their choice was rich, handsome, talented, and ambitious;
the man of my choice was poor. My father

<!-- page 226 -->

knew that I would never marry Edward Remmington
so long as Herbert Stanton was about; so he and
Remmington planned to have him sent to England
on business for them under so good a salary that it
was an inducement for him to go; for he hoped that,
with what he could save for the two years he was to
remain away, he could furnish for me a home when
he returned.</p>

<p>"Father knew of our attachment, and had said
that, if I chose to marry him, I could do so, but if I
did I should never have a cent of his property; so,
when Remmington offered him the position, he had no
idea that it was a plan to get him out of the way, for
Remmington had only spoken to my father, and
neither Herbert nor I knew of it. Soon after he left,
however, I began to find that Remmington was my
father's choice, and that he desired to marry me.</p>

<p>"I told him plainly that I was engaged to Herbert
Stanton, and should never marry any one else. He
professed great sorrow that I could not love him,
but said that he accepted his fate, and only asked
the privilege of being a friend and brother. In that
light I accepted his escort when I needed one; and
nearly a year had passed when I began to miss, in
Herbert's letters, the warmth that had hitherto
characterized them.</p>

<p>"I had no suspicion of foul play, and it grieved
me very much. Several months passed when one day
I was startled by a letter from him upraiding me in
the most bitter terms for my falsehood, and announcing,
that, as he would as soon die as live, he had
enlisted, and was on his way to the Crimea. He had

<!-- page 227 -->

addressed me by my old name, he said, as he could
never call me by any other. I took it to my father,
and asked him what it meant?</p>

<p>" 'It means,' said he, 'that he is false to you, and
takes this way to get out of it;' and then he showed
me a letter purporting to come from a cousin of
Remmington's, stating that Herbert Stanton had
married an English girl who was both beautiful and
wealthy. This letter, he said, had come to Remmington
the week before, and they were studying how to
break the news to me; but now this letter of pretension
showed that he was so unworthy, he hoped
I had pride enough to forget him as he deserved.</p>

<p>"I noticed that father avoided looking me full in
the face while he was telling me this; and I felt as
sure of it as I do now that I know it, that there had
been treachery.</p>

<p>" 'Father,' I said, 'look at me.' He did so; but
he could not look steadily and with a clear gaze.</p>

<p>" 'It is false, all false,' I said; but I said it so
calmly that I wondered at myself.</p>

<p>" 'False: what do you mean?' he stammered.</p>

<p>" 'I mean that you and Edward Remmington have
been plotting together. But I shall never marry
any one but Herbert Stanton; I will find some way
to let him know of this,' I replied.</p>

<p>" 'There is not much chance for that, for he will
not be very likely to live to get back to America,'
he said, throwing off all reserve when he found that
he was defeated in his plan to finally marry me to
Remmington.</p>

<p>" 'Then I shall never marry,' I said.</p>

<!-- page 228 -->

<p>" 'Well, I have saved myself the disgrace of having
you throw yourself away on Stanton,' he replied,
'for I will see to it that you never marry him; girl,
if you think to foil me, you will find your mistake.'</p>

<p>" 'And, if Herbert Stanton does not live to get
home, I will show you, sir, that I have yet the
power left to disgrace you,' was my calm but firm
reply, as I turned and left him. I succeeded in
undeceiving Herbert; but his reply to me was written
by another, for his right arm had been shot
away. The next news was of his death; and, to
have revenge upon my father for taking away the
brightness of my life, to save himself the disgrace of
having a son-in-law who was poor and the son of
poor, hardworking people, I disgraced him by deliberately
taking up the life of degradation to which
the pride of a hypocritical society consigns so many
of my sisters."

<p>"How is that?" I asked: "how is it that pride
consigns them to such a fate?"</p>

<p>"Because pride, their own or that of relatives,
will not permit the sons of the rich to marry poor
girls; yet there is a freshness, a womanliness, about
such girls, that attracts these rich young men powerfully;
and, as they can not marry them without
running into the face of almost insurmountable
obstacles, they lay plans to get them without marriage,
use their time and their money to accomplish
this. To ruin a poor girl, is, in the eyes of the rich
and respectable, a venial offense for a rich young
man to commit; but to marry her, an unpardonable
one. Out upon such respectability!"</p>

<!-- page 229 -->

<p>"It is damned respectability," said Rockman.</p>

<p>"But not respectable to call it by that name," I
added.</p>

<p>"I could not respect myself if I did not call it by
its right name, madam; and</p>

<p class="small">'One self-approving hour whole years outweighs<br/>

Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas.' "</p>

<p>"You must have a fund of poetry laid by to use
when argument fails, you are so ready with your
quotations," I said, laughing.</p>

<p>"This poetry is truth, though not all truth is
poetry," he retorted; and I turned to listen to the
next story.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Helen Myers, "is different from any
of yours, and I think rather a peculiar one. I lived
till I was twenty-five years of age as virtuous a life
as the world need ask for; but, after I was twenty,
my health began to fail. I was very miserable most
of the time, gloomy, despondent, had but little
strength, and medicine seemed to do me no good.
I suffered on till I was nearly twenty-five, when I
was advised to go to a water-cure, or not altogether
that, but a sort of eclectic institute, where various
agencies were used, water and dieting being among
the principal agencies. Here I grew to be better;
but I felt a strange attraction to the physician who
had charge of the institute. I had never met any
one who affected me as he did. No word passed
between us upon the subject; but I knew without
words, that the feeling was mutual, and something
that neither of us could help.

<!-- page 230 -->

<p>"He had a wife and two children; and he paid me
no more attention than he did the other lady patients,
and yet I knew that he cared more for me; and I
felt, too, that there was no love between him and
his wife; and I afterward learned that she said she
never cared for him more than she did for any other
man, but he was good-looking, intelligent, and could
give her a good home; and she married him because
she could take him away from all the other girls,
and she thought it such a triumph.</p>

<p>" 'Do you think he loved you?' asked the one to
whom she told this; and she replied, 'Oh! he would
make a fool of himself if I would let him, and I had
quite a trial with him for a while; but I finally
taught him that I was not going to have a man all
the time kissing and petting me.' But, like most
women of this class, she liked to exact all the attentions
from him that she considered her due as a
wife.</p>

<p>"She wanted people to think that he was devoted
to her, and she honored him by allowing it. I had
been there some weeks, and was getting better all
the time, when one morning he came into his room,
and found me there. I supposed that he had gone
out for the day, as he left with his wife and children
about half an hour before, and was not expected
back till toward evening. I hardly knew why I
went to his room then, though I was assisting some
about the house, and I sometimes swept out his
office.</p>

<p>"I had done so that morning before he left, while
he was visiting the patients who were not well

<!-- page 231 -->

enough to leave their rooms. But for some reason,
or without a reason, I had gone in there and sat
down after he had driven away. I was surprised to
see him, and started to leave the room; but he
caught me in his arms, and I had no power to
resist him.* It seems that he had forgotten something
that he needed, and, leaving his wife to make
a call on a friend some three-fourths of a mile away,
had come back to get it.</p>

<p class="small">[*This girl's story, as was the preceding one, is taken almost
literally from real life.]</p>

<p>"I staid there about ten days after that, and was
so far cured, that I went to my brothers, with whom
I made my home. The doctor and I never passed a
word about what had occurred that morning, but I
never felt so well in my life. I soon found, however,
that something must be done, or I was ruined for
this life; so, to save my reputation, I, with the help
of a friend, a lady much older than myself, succeeded
in destroying the result of that embrace.
But it all came out in spite of what I did to prevent
its being known; and that through a letter I sent
him when I first learned my condition, asking him
what I should do. This his wife got hold of, and
took pains to tell what she could of it that would
injure me, and at the same time keeping his name
back, claiming only that I had consulted him as a
physician.</p>

<p>"I, of course, could not make things any better by
giving his name; but it would, in reality, have been
the worse for me had the public known that it was a
married man with whom I had been intimate; so I

<!-- page 232 -->

kept still, and baffled their curiosity. But my health
was not as good after that, and my friends turned
their backs upon me; and I left them to go where
every face would not flash scorn upon me, and that
is my story."</p>

<p>"Such purity, and such respectability! Heaven
help us!" exclaimed Rockman. "The crime that
you did, Helen, was the one that respectability
forced you to, to save yourself from the natural
result of a natural attraction; and the woman
who took care to impale you upon the hook that
<i>saints</i> are always barbing for <i>sinners</i> was as much
worse than you are as the Devil is worse than an
angel. 'Ye hypocrites, ye generation of vipers,
how can ye escape the damnation of hell?'</p>

<p>"<i>Make clean</i>, MAKE CLEAN, the outside of the cup
and platter; but think not that the filth within will
escape the all-searching eye!"</p>

<p>I had expected some such outburst from Mr.
Rockman, and so made no comment, but turned to
Mary Bliss with, "And yours last."</p>

<p>"And the worst, I presume you will think," she
replied.</p>

<p>"I hope not," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, I have no plea to make other than that I
naturally loved men's society, and felt that I had a
right to it. I did not make myself; and, if such
desires make me vile, then my Creator is responsible;
I am not."</p>

<p>I must say that I was astonished; but I tried to
show as little of it as possible, and simply asked,
"Why, then, did you leave the life you were leading?"</p>

<!-- page 233 -->

<p>"Because I did not like it. I do not want what I
do not like, neither will I have it," she continued,
her eyes flashing; "and if I had staid there I
should have murdered somebody before this."</p>

<p>"Must take more than you want of men's society,
and such as you do not want, or you shall live entirely
alone; for the men are all so <i>pure</i> that they
will never marry such as you, Miss Mary," was
Rockman's comment; and she replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will see about that."</p>

<p>"You had better keep your eye on that girl, or she
will make you trouble," I said to Minnie aside.</p>

<p>"And she will be sure to make me trouble if I
attempt to watch her," was Minnie's reply.</p>

<p>I retired that night earlier than usual; not that I
expected to go immediately to sleep, for I knew that
I should not; but I wanted to think. And this was
the story of five out of ten; and in every case but
the last the evil had been induced, or made worse,
through fear of the world's frown,&mdash;in all except the
last; and she, well, even she, rejected by the world,
cast out, she had to fight the deeper degradation
which sought to force itself upon her.</p>

<p>Family pride, religious pride, and prejudice,&mdash;the
letter of the law held to be of more value than the
spirit. O God! who should solve the problem?
who should find the key that would unlock and
bring to our knowledge the reconciling law which
would harmonize these discords, right these wrongs?
And I too: what was it that had brought me to be
the companion of the Magdalen? By no deed of
wrong had this been done; and yet, in the eyes of

<!-- page 234 -->

the great world, I was counted as one of them, yea,
even as the most vile of all; for Robert Crandall had
made it appear that I was a sort of procuress in the
disguise of respectability.</p>

<p>True, I was not suspected here, neither were the
others, and we all were trying to live rightly; but,
if the past were known, how soon those young men
who boarded in those families,&mdash;the two into which
Minnie had divided the girls,&mdash;how soon they
would refuse to be <i>seen</i> going there! how soon all
support, all patronage that could aid them in earning
an honest living, would be withdrawn! And
even if this were not so, if there were those who
would stand by them in their efforts to lead an honest
life, the air of suspicion that would envelop
them, the constant espionage to which they would
be subject, would be enough to drive them wild.</p>

<p>Yes, I lay there hour after hour, and thought of all
these things, till my agony became so great that I bit
my tongue, lips, and fingers, till I nearly brought the
blood, to keep from screaming outright.</p>

<p>Finally, I dropped into a troubled slumber; and in
it I saw a vast multitude of women, who were
divided into three companies; but, as I looked
closely, I beheld that they were all chained.</p>

<p>One company stood alone, and claimed that they
always intended to stand thus; but still they looked
longingly toward a company of men who walked
hither and thither at their will. This company of
women were chained by the State; for the law of the
State said, "Thou shalt not come close to man
unless thou first compliest with the terms laid down

<!-- page 235 -->

in the book of ordinances; to wit, thou shalt be freed
from the State bonds only on condition that a bond,
a chain just long enough to bind two as one, take its
place; and, if thou darest to do otherwise, thou shalt
be stoned in the market-place; not with literal
rocks, but with the scorn that is even of a more
unyielding material." And all the people, as this
command was uttered, lifted up their voices, and
said, "AMEN."</p>

<p>The second company stood behind a long row of
men, though I noticed that now and then a woman
had stepped to the front, and placed the man behind
her; but this was a rare occurrence. Now and then a
man had also put his arm around the woman standing
behind him, and brought her up to his side; but
this was unusual, and she could stand thus only as
he held her. The rule was, that a man could take a
woman from the State, if she chose to go with him,
upon condition that he bound her to himself; and,
because woman had this right to the choice of masters,
I heard a song of rejoicing, the burden of which
was, "Freedom."</p>

<p>Now, it seemed to me in my sleep that this was a
strange kind of freedom; and, when I spoke of it,
those standing by pointed to the third company of
women, and asked me if I would prefer such freedom
as theirs. Then I looked, and beheld that these
women, who were called free women, were in a most
terrible condition; for the women who belonged to
the State hated them because they stood in the way,
oftentimes, of their getting individual masters; while
those who stood behind the men hated them because

<!-- page 236 -->

the eyes of their owners often turned toward these,
instead of looking lovingly over their shoulders upon
those who were legally theirs.</p>

<p>And I further saw that these women who were
called free were really in the power of the State
when it chose to oppress them; and of not only one,
but of all men who chose to claim them, indirectly
at least; and that, more than all this, both of the
before-named companies of women were combined
against them; so that, in reality, instead of freedom,
they were in the most abject of all bondages.
They were the scorn of all, and had the rights of
none.</p>

<p>I grieved in my sleep that this was so, and wondered
if there was none to help, when a voice from
one that I could not see said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered
that there was none to uphold; then my own
arm brought salvation."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" I asked of one standing
near. He looked at me as though he did not comprehend;
and I said, "Did you not hear the voice?"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing," was the reply; and again the
voice said, "Having ears they hear not, neither can
they understand. I am that I am, and I reside within
each and all as the power that can bring salvation,
when they will turn to me: then I assert myself in
them both to will and to do; and they are made to
feel a self-reliant strength, which they know is not
of themselves, and still is one with them."</p>

<p>"God within," I murmured under my breath; and
the response was "God within."</p>

<!-- page 237 -->

<p>When I woke to outer consciousness, the sun was
shining full in my face, and the sound of the words
"A new heaven and a new earth," were lingering in
my ears.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">LIKE UNTO THE SON OF MAN.</p>

</div>

<p>THE next evening after this singular
dream, or vision, Minnie, Rose, Rockman,
and myself were sitting together
at my home; and I told them of what I
have already told the reader, adding as
I finished the relation, "It is strange how Bible-scenes
and the application of Bible-texts seem to
mingle in with all that we think or do." As I concluded,
Eben looked up and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, in what sense is truth like God?"</p>

<p>"Because, like God, it is eternal," said Rose.</p>

<p>"Eternal in its essence, but continually changing
its form," I added.</p>

<p>"You mistake in saying that truth changes its
form," said Rockman: "it never does."</p>

<p>"I do not see how you can say that?" questioned
Rose.</p>

<p>"Can that which fills all forms change one
form for another? The change is in us,&mdash;in the
growth which takes us through one form into the
next. We say that truth changes its form, and we
say the sun rises and sets; both of which are apparently
so, but really not so. It is in this sense that
truth is like God; it is infinite in form, and a unit in
essence."</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

<p>"But what connection has this with what I
remarked about Bible-scenes?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Simply this: the inner life, the form of truth in
such as constantly use the Bible as illustrative of
life, is in harmony with the form of truth as there
expressed."</p>

<p>"And, if not really in the same form, they see it
so," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Truth is in reality naked; we clothe her to
suit ourselves. I have somewhere read a story of a
man who read a Bible-text wrong, but he deduced a
truth from the mistake, and made his application
accordingly. The text that he spoke from reads as
follows; 'And he maketh my feet like unto hind's
feet;' but he read it 'hen's feet,' and then went on
to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'You see, my brethren, how God protects and
provides for us. As the hen can clasp her feet around
her perch, and go to sleep without the fear of falling,
God having so constructed the muscles that they
will not unclasp even while she sleeps, and can not
watch for herself; thus she sleeps in safety, for she
is in God's care: so we, if we trust in him, shall
find that our feet will cling, even when the enemy
thinks we must fall; for God holds us, his everlasting
arm is round about and beneath us.' You see
in this case," continued Rockman, "Truth could
bend around a twig with a hen's foot as easily as she
could skip over the mountains with the foot of the
hind."</p>

<p>We all laughed heartily at Eben's story, and asked
him if he was relating some of his own ministerial
experience.</p>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p>"I said I read it," he replied, pretending to be
offended that we should doubt his word.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said I, "if he is angry: I have a
story to tell that will make him good natured again.
I did not read it; but I heard a man tell it who
said that a cousin of his was the minister in question."</p>

<p>"That is more definite: let us hear it, aunty,"
cried Rose.</p>

<p>"Well, it was like this: there is a passage in
Revelation which reads, 'And I beheld, and, lo, a
black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of
balances in his hand.' The minister, who was cousin
to the man who related it to me, read, 'And he had a
pair of bellowses in his hand:' then, laying down
the book, he proceeded to make the application
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'My friends, these were not the bellowses that
the housewife uses to blow up the fire, nor the ones
that the blacksmith uses at the forge, but God
Almighty's eternal great bellows to blow sinners to
hell with.' "</p>

<p>This story was greeted with peals of laughter,
and the declaration that I had beat Uncle Eben
entirely.</p>

<p>"But he did not carry out the bellowses to the
end: he had to make the word 'bellows' at last,"
remarked Rockman.</p>

<p>"Oh! that is nothing," laughed Minnie; "he kept
up the added syllable till he got far enough away
from balances to forget it, and after that it did not
matter."</p>

<!-- page 241 -->

<p>"Neither does it make but little difference
whether truth swings in the balance, or is blown
through the bellows, I suppose you will say," I
added.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Rockman. "But this
reminds me of some conversation that we had about
the Bible, some time since, in which the idea was
advanced, that the 'one like unto the Son of man,'
spoken of by the prophet Daniel, was a government
that was to come upon the earth, which in its construction
should correspond to the human constitution."</p>

<p>"And the writer who broached the idea further
declared, if I recollect aright, that this nation is
now, as to its form of government, like to a man's
body with the head of a beast," I added.</p>

<p>"Yes: and I have thought very much of it since,
and I believe that he was about right."</p>

<p>"Will you please give us your ideas upon the
subject. Uncle Eben?" asked Rose.</p>

<p>"I will try to do so, child. And, in the first
place, I will say what you all know to be true; to
wit, a beast walks upon four legs, and a man upon
two."</p>

<p>"I believe we all know that, uncle."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have not applied it to this problem,
I presume, puss. We as a nation have ceased to
bow down before our rulers: we walk upright, like
men, like independent sovereigns; we have, nationally,
a man's body. Now, what of the head? What
is the difference between the head of the man, and
the head of the beast?"</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>"I rather think, uncle, that the man has the most
brain."</p>

<p>"In what respect, Rose? more absolutely, or
more in proportion to the faculties and powers possessed?"</p>

<p>"More absolutely, I think," she replied.</p>

<p>"And yet the beast has a brain organ for every
power possessed, as well as the man."</p>

<p>"You mean, uncle, for every power of thought,
of intelligence?"</p>

<p>"I do, Rose; and for every instinctive function
also. Combativeness helps it to overcome obstacles,
and destructiveness aids in securing its food; alimentiveness
corresponds to the stomach, and amativeness
to the procreative function. These are
the names that phrenologists give to some of the
organs in the base of the human brain; and they are
in common with those possessed by the animal.
But there are other powers possessed by the human;
and these powers are represented in the human
head, the human brain. Each and every one of
them are thus represented."</p>

<p>"And you think that this is not true of our national
head?" I said.</p>

<p>"I know that it is not; indeed, in that respect,
we have hardly the head of a beast, nationally
speaking. Our governmental head makes one department
do the part of two or three brain-organs,
instead of having a department to represent each.
Then look at the different classes in society: are
they represented by distinct departments in the
governmental head? Not by any means.</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p>"We have in this representative district, doctors,
lawyers, mechanics, farmers, manufacturers, merchants,
&amp;c.; and all these must be represented
in Congress by one man; and not a woman there.
A one-sided head that, a sort of blockhead.</p>

<p>"Suppose a lawyer is elected from this district; to
be true to his constituents, he must represent both
the men and the women of every class and trade, of
every profession and calling, in the whole district.
It would be just as reasonable to expect that the
organ of hope in the human head should act for
caution, secretiveness, ideality, benevolence, sublimity,
conscientiousness, &amp;c.,&mdash;it would be just as
reasonable to expect that this one organ of the
human head should act for and represent all these
separate powers of the soul, as to expect that a
lawyer can fairly represent and act for all these
different classes of people.</p>

<p>"But our governmental head has no organ, no
department, separate and distinct from, yet acting
with, the others, to represent these varying interests.
It does not represent all the powers of its national
body, its national soul; so it is the head of a beast
upon the shoulders of a man, nationally speaking."</p>

<p>"And what are we going to do about it?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Educate the people to see that this is so first,
and the rest will take care of itself," was his
reply.</p>

<p>"But when this government like unto the Son
of man, one that has this harmony between the
capacities of its head, and the needs of its body the

<!-- page 244 -->

people,&mdash;when this government is inaugurated,
what then?" said Minnie.</p>

<p>"It will break in pieces and destroy all the beast
kingdoms, and it will reign over the whole earth;
for then the kingdoms of this world, <i>the beast kingdoms</i>,
will become the kingdoms of our Lord and his
Christ; the entire human family constituting one
grand man, with a head so related to the body, that
it will provide for all the needs of that body, from
the fact that there will be pain in the head, or suffering
of some kind, if this is not done.</p>

<p>"If our governmental head was so related to its
body that every pain felt by the body was telegraphed
there by the nerves of sensation, in exact
quantity and quality, think you that the people's
money would be used and the people's needs forgotten
as they are now?</p>

<p>"But we have a beast's head; and how can it
respond to the needs of a body like unto that of a
man?"</p>

<p>"And do you really think, uncle," asked Rose,
"that the one like unto the Son of man, seen by the
prophet, is to be a government so perfect that it will
endure for ever?"</p>

<p>"I think, puss, that this is as likely to be the
true interpretation as any other. Truth, like God,
is large enough to fill a nation, as well as small
enough to dwell in a man. I do not see why it
can not sway a nation as one man, as well as to sway
a nation through one man."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Minnie, "I am sick of all these
various Bible interpretations: what difference does
it make, anyhow?"</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>"You think, if you could find one son of man who
would be loving and true, you would be satisfied, I
presume," laughed Rockman.</p>

<p>"If he should happen to suit me, I would; otherwise
not," she replied.</p>

<p>"What a nice little housewife it would make!"
he continued in the same strain.</p>

<p>"You mistake, sir, I shall never marry; but
when that Son of man form of government is established,
I presume that the kingdom of heaven will
be set up on earth, and they will neither marry nor
be given in marriage, but be like the angels; and
we can then have what love we need without being
slaves."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they will put money out upon interest
then?" said Rose.</p>

<p>"Yes, when people put a hand out upon interest,
and expect two hands in return," I said.</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" she retorted; "when the
governmental head becomes perfected, and the
national body is joined to it rightly, we shall then
be one; and you might as well talk of one hand
eating the other hand, or of the heart asking interest
of the foot, because it furnished the blood that made
it a live foot. Suppose, now, that, for every ten
drops of blood furnished by the heart to the foot,
it should demand eleven in return?"</p>

<p>Rockman clapped his hands. "Bravo, little Rose:
you have given us the best illustration yet, of the
one-sided tendency of capital drawing interest."</p>

<p>"Then I hardly think that poor folks will have to
pay interest on their debts till they have more than

<!-- page 246 -->

paid the amount of the principal, when the one like
unto the Son of man comes. I wish he would hurry
along."</p>

<p>"Of course you do, Rose. I never saw a pretty
girl who did not wish that some son of man would
come."</p>

<p>"That will do, uncle. I do not relish that kind
of joking: my experiences have been too bitter."</p>

<p>"Well, you may forgive me this time, if you think
it will benefit you any to exercise that virtue," he
said with a mock gravity that made her laugh in
spite of her efforts to the contrary.</p>

<p>"I wonder if woman will ever have to sell herself
for bread when that form of government is inaugurated?"
said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Of course not. What does the book say of it,
or of what shall be done when one like to the Son
of man comes? If we accept one portion of it, there
must be some connection of that which is accepted,
with the rest of it," said Rose earnestly.</p>

<p>"What does it say, Rose?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It says that the saints of the Most High, not
such as we have now, pretended ones, but real
saints, shall take the kingdom and possess it for ever,
even for ever and ever."</p>

<p>"Such saints can never defile woman," remarked
Rockman: "that is certain."</p>

<p>"If that kingdom is to be set up upon earth, and
there shall be no more sorrow nor crying when it is
done, let us all work and pray for its coming," said
Minnie solemnly.</p>

<p>Amen and amen, we responded; and we were

<!-- page 247 -->

silent, though each continued to think how a government
could be constructed so that it would in
reality be as intimately connected with the interests
of the people, as is the head with the body.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">MINNIE'S WORK</p>

</div>

<p>PROGRESSED finely. The girls in each
home so planned, that, after the necessary
household cares were over, they
had time for considerable other business;
they continuing to keep day-boarders
(gentlemen) a number at least equal to themselves,
sometimes more. This kept up sort of a balance
between the two sexes, magnetically, holding the
young men back from questionable places of recreation,
and saving the girls from that isolation so
common to sewing-girls.</p>

<p>Commencing with two homes and ten girls, she
had enlarged the number till there were four homes
in that place; and she had added, beside, one girl to
each home, and to one of them two; so there were
twenty-five girls there who had been counted lost,
who were earning an honest living, and as many
more in other places; and beside these there, were
ten others, or, rather, ten that had been in these homes
till they had been somewhat tested as to being in
earnest in their efforts, who had been placed by
Minnie, where they could become skilled in the
different trades pertaining to woman's work; and
others had taken their places in the homes: sixty

<!-- page 249 -->

in all, besides two who had married, and gone to the
Far West.</p>

<p>"And this in one year," Minnie said to me one
day, her eyes sparkling with delight at the thought;
"sixty-two in one year; at the same rate, ten years
would give six hundred and twenty. That for my
efforts; while the others, many of them, will have become
helpers long before that time."</p>

<p>I smiled on her enthusiasm, and was glad with her;
and yet, somehow, I rejoiced with trembling, for I
felt as though they were only succeeding because the
public, the great Christian public, did not know
their past. I was well aware, that should they join
the church, and consent to be watched and patronized,
being exceedingly humble and submissive,
grateful for all the critical care that would be
gratuitously bestowed, then they might be permitted
to live if they could support themselves.</p>

<p>But that they would be allowed to retain their
independence, their self-respect, I knew could not
be; and I knew further, that these girls would accept
no such position, and there would be nothing
for them but to go back to their old lives.</p>

<p>And even if they would accept all this watching,
all this criticism, how were they to live? Would men
dare to face the world, and continue to board with
them? Would they continue to treat them with the
deference and respect that they now accorded them
publicly? Would those men, who now went with
them openly to places of amusement, continue to do
so? would they give them their sewing and whatever
other work they could furnish, to aid them in securing
an honest livelihood?</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>They would not dare; and why? Because of
those virtuous women who rule society openly. Such
women know that men visit these women secretly,
and they will not discard them for that; but the <i>woman</i>,
she must be ostracised. Why are these things
so? There is a reason why, but I could not see it
then; I only knew that it was so.</p>

<p>The next time Mr. Rockman came, I told him
what Minnie had said, and my feelings upon the
subject.</p>

<p>"Minnie is benefiting herself, but is doing the
world no real good," was his reply.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say, madam."</p>

<p>"Doing no good! Do you intend to say that these
girls are no better off than when living a life of
shame?"</p>

<p>"These particular girls may be, but it is only robbing
Peter to pay Paul."</p>

<p>I looked at him in a dazed sort of way; for I began
to get a faint glimpse of his meaning, and was
not ready to admit the conclusion that must come
if I accepted his premises.</p>

<p>"The human family is one," he continued, "and
its interests are one, though people as yet are not big
enough,&mdash;have not grown to the condition in which
they can see this. That, then, which lifts one up at
the expense of pulling another down is no real
benefit."</p>

<p>"But I can not see," I said, "how lifting these girls
out of their degradation is going to pull others in."</p>

<p>"It need not, if society were not constructed upon

<!-- page 251 -->

the see-saw principle. I suppose you know what
teetering is; have put a board across a log or through
the fence, and sitting on one end, with a playmate on
the other, have balanced up and down."</p>

<p>"Of course I have; was there ever a child who
did not do this some time in the course of their childhood?"
and I laughed as I said it at the simpleness
of the illustration.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is simple," he remarked, "so simple that
you know that it is utterly impossible for one end of
the board to rise higher than that upon which it
rests across at the center, without the opposite end
going down just as far. Society is constructed upon
the same principle: only they have loaded one end of
the board so heavy that it is all of the time down;
this brings the opposite end up, and it is so high that
those upon it can not stay there only as every inch is
filled till there can be no sliding; this forces those at
the lower end to bear the weight of all above them;
and it is so great that the lower end keeps sinking
deeper and deeper into the mud, while those above
rest more and more wholly upon those upon it.</p>

<p>"This being true, no one can manage to crawl up
without crowding some one else down. They may
not see who it is, may not see the connection between
another's fall and their elevation; but it
exists nevertheless."</p>

<p>"I do not see, then, as anybody can do any real
good," I said, with a despairing sob, a sort of choking,
which nearly took my breath.</p>

<p>"The only real good, as I said of Minnie, is to
ourselves; it is educational. We try to do good

<!-- page 252 -->

under the present order of things, and, when we find
that we can not, then if we have within us the persevering
good, if we do not become weary in our
efforts at well-doing, we turn our attention to the
principle upon which a better order of things can be
constructed, a ladder or stairway upon which the
angels can descend, and mortals ascend, without one
interfering with another."</p>

<p>"But how is the present order to be changed for
another?" I asked. "I, for my part, can not see how
it can be done when we are so connected one with
another, that it takes all our strength to keep ourselves
and those others from falling."</p>

<p>"Fall, if there is no other way to get out; even if
the whole fabric tumbles in consequence. I know
that parents suffer, that children suffer, and that
we are counted cruel if we dare to take a step which
causes them suffering; and as we love our reputation
too well to part with it, and are too selfish to want
<i>our</i> friends to suffer, we keep on in the same old
track. But he that loveth father or mother, wife or
children, more than the truth, can not enter into the
enjoyment of the blessings which Truth has in store
for those who follow in her footsteps."</p>

<p>"Too selfish to permit our friends to suffer," I repeated,
my mind fastening only upon that point: "I
thought it was self-denial when we refrained from
doing what we desired to do, on the account of
others."</p>

<p>"It may be that, madam; or it may be the most
abject selfishness or cowardice."</p>

<p>"If you will please, uncle, to explain this to me so

<!-- page 253 -->

that I can understand just what you mean, I shall be
very much obliged," I said. I did this because I had
learned from experience that he generally knew what
he was saying, and, at the same time, I could not in
the least see how it could be possible that self-denial
could be selfishness; so I put the question to him in
as humble and deferential a manner as possible.</p>

<p>He laughed in his peculiar manner, and said, "Certainly
uncle will please to do that very thing; and he
will take the teeter&mdash;the board across the fence&mdash;as
an illustration. We will first imagine the board to be
a hundred times as long, and a hundred times as wide,
and the fence correspondingly high; and the whole
so inclosed that there was no getting away unless the
wall is broken down, scaled, or a hole made through
it."</p>

<p>I interrupted him with, "You have made a wonderful
supposition now."</p>

<p>"Well, it is a true one so far as its analogy to the
present structure of society is concerned," he replied,
"for we are in just that condition. Let us look now
at our supposed case. All along the bottom line are
weak ones and strong ones; and this is true all the
way up. All along the bottom line are noble hearts
of manhood and trusting hearts of womanhood, as
well as selfish ones of each class; and this is also
true all the way up.</p>

<p>"All along the bottom line are those who are, who
must be, crushed by the pressure; and this, too, is more
or less true all the way up; for there is side pressure
as well as the pressure from above. Now look at
them; see them squirm. What a wriggling mass!

<!-- page 254 -->

They can not help it; in their child's play, in their
ignorance, they have got themselves into this condition,
and they can not get out.</p>

<p>" 'If I could make a hole in that wall, I could get
out of this; and, if I did not have to use my strength
to keep my wife and children from being crushed, I
could do it,' is the conclusion arrived at by those
who stop to consider the situation.</p>

<p>"The selfish man would say, 'Well, I can't stand
this: I am going to make a hole in that wall, or jump
over it;' and regardless of wife, children, or any
thing else, he does so; but wife and children are
crushed.</p>

<p>"His neighbor says, 'What a selfish man! I would
die before I would do that: if we must perish, dear
wife, we will all die together.'</p>

<p>"Here we have a selfish man, and a generous, self-sacrificing
man, as we find them at one standpoint.
And we will now take a couple from another standpoint;
and we shall find, that, so far as immediate acts
are concerned, their positions are reversed: the generous,
self-denying man doing what the selfish one
did in the other case, and the selfish one acting
apparently from the plane of self-denial.</p>

<p>"The selfish man says, 'If I could only turn my
strength against that wall, I could beat it down, and
then these people could get out. But there would
be a terrible rush, and many would be crushed.
Could I be certain that I could take my wife and
children with me, or that I should not lose my own life
in the attempt, I would do it; but, as it is now, there
is too much risk; and, beside, if I use my strength

<!-- page 255 -->

to batter down that wall, I can not use it for the comfort
of my family, and people will say that I am only
selfish in my efforts; and I guess I will stay where I
am; but I really wish somebody would do that work,
would open a way to escape from this.'</p>

<p>"Poor, weak, selfish coward that he is! and yet he
flatters himself with the terms, 'duty, self-denial.'
His duty is staying by his family <i>because</i> he prefers
to work for them, rather than lose his good name;
his self-denial consists in saving his own life, refusing
even the risk of losing it, though he sees that he
might save the lives of hundreds by so doing. The
fact of having more light on the subject, the fact
of seeing, of feeling all this, is what changes the
character of his acts. Has 'uncle' made it plain
so far?"</p>

<p>"Uncle has made it plain;" I said, "and he does
not need to carry out the illustration, for I can understand
now, how that which would look like selfishness
to another might in reality be the grandest
self-denial, the grandest benevolence; and I never
before saw so plainly the meaning of the declaration,
'He that loveth father or mother, wife or children,
more than Me, is not worthy of me.' "</p>

<p>He made no comment; and I continued, "Do you
think it would be well to tell Minnie what you have
told me?"</p>

<p>"No: let her work at the problem a little longer
in her own way. The Lord of hosts is preparing a
goodly number to blow down the walls of Jericho,
and Rahab the harlot must do her share."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Rockman, you do not call Minnie a
harlot."</p>

<!-- page 256 -->

<p>"<i>Mr</i>. Rockman does not; but the world has counted
her one, and would now did it know all; while many
of those that she is trying to save have really been
such. Minnie is of the household of faith, for she
has actually protected the spies, myself and Rose;
and, more, she has faith that she can save herself, and
those that she is gathering from among society's
doomed ones, or she would never attempt it."</p>

<p>"Uncle, do you really live and move and have
your being in the Bible?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Got off your stilts, have you, and can call me
uncle again? No, madam, I do not, but I seem to
have a great deal of it treasured up, ready for use;
and it is in me, instead of my being in it. That it
vitalizes and moves me, I do not question; but it
does not surround, envelop me."</p>

<p>"You say, 'Minnie believes, has faith, that she can
save herself and those with her;' and you said a while
since that she was doing no 'real good to the world.'
I can not quite understand in what particular sense
you mean this."</p>

<p>"I thought I explained the principles involved,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I want the particular application."</p>

<p>"Ah, you do? Well, do you suppose there is any
more sewing or washing done now, than there was
one year ago?"</p>

<p>"I do not think there is," I replied.</p>

<p>"Are there any more men who want board, in proportion
to those who depend upon that method of
getting a livelihood?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," I was forced to admit, though I

<!-- page 257 -->

could but see that he was making me answer my own
question.</p>

<p>"Are the influences that tend to crush woman any
less,&mdash;the libertine any less determined to secure his
victim; parents who are rich and proud any more
willing that their sons should marry poor girls; or are
ambitious, unprincipled young men any more willing
to marry poor but worthy or really lovely girls,&mdash;than
they were one year ago?"</p>

<p>"I can not see, uncle, that there has been any
change in that respect," I said.</p>

<p>"One more question, and then I will make the
application if you wish; or you may do so yourself,"
he said. "Has woman's heart, woman's nature,
changed in any particular respect? does she hunger
less for love? or is she any less liable to trust where
she loves?"</p>

<p>I only shook my head, and he continued, "Then
we have the same material to work upon, the same
general relations one to another, and the same force
to be expended; only the particular relations have
changed. Sixty girls have stepped out of the range
of these forces, and are doing the work that supported,
that went to aid others in feeding and clothing
themselves. There is no more work to be done
than before.</p>

<p>"No particular sixty girls are deprived of all their
means of support; but there is a greater pressure
brought to bear upon a large number; and, through
this extra pressure, at least sixty will be thrown so
much more directly under the influences that made
the other sixty what they were, that these will take
their places."</p>

<!-- page 258 -->

<p>"O God!" I groaned, burying my face in my
hands, "who shall deliver us from this state of
things?"</p>

<p>"God manifest in the flesh," he replied.</p>

<p>"God manifest in the flesh! I have heard that old,
old story long enough. We are told that God was
manifest in the flesh more than eighteen hundred
years ago, and the world is not saved; we are not
even taught to expect salvation for the masses, but
only for ourselves and a chosen few," I said bitterly.</p>

<p>"All do not teach that: some claim salvation for
all," he said.</p>

<p>"Not here; not of the body, not from the evils of
this present condition; we are only taught to endure,
to be patient, to trust. I want a present salvation,
one that will take hold of the whole people, and lift
them up."</p>

<p>"And God wants them to grow up, instead of being
lifted up. Those who are lifted up must be held up;
while those who grow to the same height can stand
alone, and, at the same time, aid those who are growing.
Poor child, groan away; they are growing
pains. St. Paul says that 'the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the
glory that shall be revealed'&mdash;where? not in Jesus,
but '<i>in us</i>.' "</p>

<p>"More Bible," I repeated in the same bitter
spirit.</p>

<p>"Yes, wormwood and gall for you to drink, while
in your present state of mind; but it is Bible that
tells where God must be manifest in the flesh in

<!-- page 259 -->

order to salvation,&mdash;in us, in the race; and we must
grow ere we are large enough to manifest a saving
degree thereof."</p>

<p>"But what of those who not get large enough in
this life?" I asked.</p>

<p>"God will take care of them; and there is room
enough in the universe for them to grow, and time
enough in eternity in which to grow," was his reply.</p>

<p>"But that will not bring the redemption of the
body, that Paul speaks of," I said.</p>

<p>"I do not see why it will not, if we grow in knowledge
till we can resume and take care of them, little
woman."</p>

<p>"Only God can give us that power."</p>

<p>"And that is just what I am talking about,&mdash;God
manifest in the flesh. If we grow till we can hold
enough of God to enable us to re-clothe ourselves in
the flesh, would not God be manifest in the flesh, our
flesh, to salvation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! you are so metaphysical! no, not
exactly that, for you make things plain enough; but
it takes so long to bring about the result, that one
gets tired of waiting," I said.</p>

<p>"If you can find a quicker way, do not wait; I
would not." He said this with such provoking calmness,
that, to my impatient spirit, it was like pouring
oil on fire; and, to avoid the storm that I felt rising,
I turned and left him.</p>

<p>Rebellious, was I? I know it; and I am not
wholly cured of that fault yet; but I am beginning
to learn that there is wisdom at the helm, a wisdom
directing things, that is greater than mine.</p>

<!-- page 260 -->

<p>When I have fully grown to this, when the lesson is
learned, then perhaps God can so manifest himself
through me as to accomplish what, or a portion of
what, I so earnestly desire.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">LOVE'S CONFLICT.</p>

</div>

<p>PERHAPS, by this time, the reader would
like to hear something more of the Rev.
Arthur Berrian. The night that I left
my home, and stole away like the guilty
thing I was <i>not</i>. I had intended leaving
a note for the minister, telling him that it would be
of no use to try to learn where I had gone, but, upon
further thought, had decided that it would look like
presuming that he felt quite an interest in me: so I
did nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Neither did I leave any clew by means of which
he could trace me; and the first thing I did after
reaching Rose, Minnie, and the others, was to impress
upon them the absolute necessity of holding no communication
whatever with any one in B&mdash;&mdash;; "for,"
said I, "if you do, Robert Crandall will be sure to
trace us."</p>

<p>I had been there but a few weeks, when Rockman
received a letter from Mr. Berrian, inquiring how
things prospered, and asked if I was with them;
saying that I had left B&mdash;&mdash;, and he presumed I was
aiding in carrying out the good work that had been
planned. Rockman did not reply then; but, having
occasion to go to an adjoining town a few weeks
afterward, he replied from there, saying,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 262 -->

<p>"Your letter has reached me, sir, but I am alone.
I know where the others are, and the work they
have undertaken is prospering; but you know, sir,
what the prejudices of society are, and you know
also that there is one at least, whose malice would
lead him to pursue them to the death; therefore,
though appreciating your kindness, I know that I
speak their sentiments when I beg that you will
leave us all entirely alone."</p>

<p>Months elapsed before we heard any thing further,
and I had concluded that he had given us up;
but I was mistaken. He had heard something said,
it seemed, when away from home, that, in connection
with what he knew of us, led him to believe related
to us. As near as I could learn, it must have been
one of our boarders, who, while on a visit home, had
entered into conversation with a friend about his
business, and was trying to persuade the friend to
return with him, and among the inducements offered
spoke of his boarding-place, and mentioned a name
which Mr. Berrian only partially understood, and yet,
taken in connection with what else he heard, he decided
to be Morris.</p>

<p>Knowing what Minnie Morris was trying to do,
he made another effort to learn where I was, and this
time he wrote to her. She did not reply. A few
weeks after, he wrote to Rose with the same result;
and in each letter he inquired for me.</p>

<p>"He is in love with you," said Minnie. I laughed
at the supposition, but will confess that I had half
suspected as much, and that it made my heart beat
more quickly to have my suspicions thus strengthened.</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>A month or six weeks more elapsed, and I received
one myself. I did as the others had, took no
notice of it. But he was not to be put off thus.
In less than a month I received another; and in this
he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am determined to find you, if I have to write
to every post-office in the United States. I have
written the postmaster, that, if this is taken out, to
let me know immediately: so if you are there I shall
know it, and, if I do not get a reply in a reasonable
length of time, I shall come myself."</p>

<p>"Love is more persevering than hate," was my
comment when I read this; for I no longer had any
doubt of his love. I had suspected it before; I
knew it now. How was it with myself, do you ask?
Ah, there was where the difficulty lay. I loved him
so well, I felt that I had rather die than bring the
shadow of reproach upon him.</p>

<p>But what should I do now? Could I stay and
meet him? for if he came to the place he would be
certain to find me. If I did not write he would
come; and if I did, and forbade it, would he heed
my commands? I felt that he would not. Then
my mind went to Robert Crandall. I thought of all
that he had done, of the respect in which he was
held by the world, of the malice which had prompted
him to misrepresent and defame me under pretense
of caring for the morals of society. I thought
how but for this I might have remained in B&mdash;&mdash;,
and have accepted the love that I so hungered for,
without the danger of blighting the usefulness of
him I loved: I thought of all this, till, if there

<!-- page 264 -->

was ever murder in a human heart, there was in
mine.</p>

<p>True, had Robert Crandall been present, and in
my power, I could not have carried out the feeling:
I had neither the nerve nor the courage; but, could
I have seen him dead at my feet, I should have rejoiced.
Then I recoiled from myself as the thought
of Mr. Berrian, of Arthur, came to me. What
would he think of such wickedness? Was I worthy
of a true man's love, of the love of an earnest Christian
man, if such feelings could find place in my
heart?</p>

<p>No, I was not; and it was well, perhaps, that circumstances
had shown me this: otherwise I should
never have known how wicked I was. And yet I
might have known it; for had I not turned with
impatience, if not with contempt, from what seemed
to me a too constant reference to the Bible? But
why should I see this now as wickedness, hardness
of heart, any more than at any previous time? was
it because I was so in love with Mr. Berrian that I
condemned myself from what I thought would be
his standpoint of judgment?</p>

<p>My pride rebelled at this: I would be myself or
nothing; and thus the conflict went on through the
livelong night, and in the morning I was no better
prepared to take a definite step in any direction,
than before. However, I must do something; and
in my desperation I dashed off the following note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>MR. BERRIAN.</p>

<p><i>Rev. Sir</i>,&mdash;I am fully conscious of the honor you do me in
the interest you take in my whereabouts, and as conscious that

<!-- page 265 -->

a further acquaintance can be of no benefit to either of us.
The Hon. Mr. Crandall drove me from B&mdash;&mdash;, and the Rev.
Mr. Berrian now drives me from this place. You can come if
you choose; but I shall not be here, neither shall I leave any
clew by means of which I can be found.</p>

<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

</div>

<p>"There!" said I to myself as I sealed and directed
it, "I guess that will settle the matter."</p>

<p>But the difficulty was not over yet. I had said
that I would leave the place, and I intended to do
so; but where should I go? Could I get things
settled so as to leave before he would get there? I
was haggard with the loss of sleep, and the effect
of the mental struggle through which I had passed,
I was going to say; but that would not have been the
truth, for it was not yet over. I saw this as I looked
in my glass, and said to myself, "A pretty looking
object I would be for Mr. Berrian to see now."</p>

<p>Rockman came in soon after, and, as he saw me,
started back in surprise. "What is the matter,
woman? have you been struggling with fiends of
darkness? the grip of old Apollyon himself could
not make you look worse!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I had not intended to say a thing about the
matter to any of them; but somehow I was not
myself. A something, I know not what, constrained
me to act contrary to my intentions, and I placed
Mr. Berrian's letter in his hands.</p>

<p>He read it, looked at me, and then read it again,
and finally said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should this distress you?"</p>

<p>I was not prepared to tell him why, and I blushed
scarlet.</p>

<!-- page 266 -->

<p>"Lest haply ye be found fighting against God,"
he repeated.</p>

<p>I was about to burst forth with an indignant protest
against this persistent quotation of Scripture to
meet every case that came up; but the remembrance
of what I had suffered the night previous calmed
me, and I simply asked, "What do you mean by
that?"</p>

<p>"I mean that love, real honest love, is God, and
woe to those who crucify him! Love has taken
possession of your heart; and you are determined to
cast out the heavenly guest."</p>

<p>"True love will never knowingly bring shame to
its object," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh! there is where you have given the Devil
place, is it? What would you think of the man, who,
having won a woman's love and confidence, would
murder her, because he so loved her that he would
save her from disgrace?"</p>

<p>"I can not see what bearing that question has
upon this," I said.</p>

<p>"Stop," said he sternly. "You may deceive yourself
in your pride, but you can not deceive me. You
do see the bearing of my question: you know that
Arthur Berrian loves you; and you further know,
that, to such a nature as his, love is no light thing.
You love him also, and you are trying to kill his
love, to render it hopeless, and at the same time
endeavoring to crush your own heart,&mdash;a double
murder; and all because you are too proud to allow
him to decide whether he is strong enough to let
your love cost him something.</p>

<!-- page 267 -->

<p>"If you could feel, that, in the eyes of the world,
you could bring honor to the man you love, there
would be no difficulty. You pay small compliment
to his manhood, when you thus practically say that
he is not strong enough to meet and battle down
unjust reproach. Oh, pride, pride, what a subtle
devil thou art!"</p>

<p>I can not describe the contending feelings that
possessed me while he was speaking; and I made no
reply to this outburst. Presently he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fight away; you need the discipline; God's
chosen ones must be tried as by fire, and you will
find yourself at length."</p>

<p>I looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "you will find yourself; and
then you will overcome the world, will cast it out,
and its smile or its frown will no longer influence
your decisions. What if the world does demand
that a minister's wife should be above reproach? does
he serve the world, or God? Was the Master who
overcame the world free from its reproach? His
heart has gone out to you, yours has responded; and
through that double voice God has spoken, and
declared that ye are one: will you, at the world's
command, try to put asunder what God hath joined?</p>

<p>"No man, no woman, can bless the world till, like
Jesus, they are lifted above it; hold themselves, or
are held by the power of God, and their faith in him;
are thus held where they can draw the world upward
and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I am not fit to be a minister's wife," I burst
forth.</p>

<!-- page 268 -->

<p>"Do you know what he wants better than he
does?</p>

<p class="small">'If you tarry till you're better,<br/>

You will never come at all.'</p>

<p>"So says the hymn of invitation, and it tells the
truth. When God sends the blessing of a great love
to the human soul, it has no right to reject the gift."</p>

<p>"One would think you were pleading for yourself,
you talk so earnestly," I said at length.</p>

<p>"That is because I love my neighbor as myself,"
he replied; and just then the door-bell rang.</p>

<p>"I will go," he said, "and give you time to put
on a company face: you do not want to meet any
one with such a dubious-looking countenance as
that."</p>

<p>I left him to do as he suggested, while I went and
washed my face and hands, brushed my hair, and
tried to bring back my natural look; for, as before
said, I was haggard with the loss of sleep, and with
the mental struggle that was upon me. When I
returned to learn who had called, I was confronted
with the Rev. Mr. Berrian himself. He came quickly
forward with the assurance of a man who loves, and
feels that he is beloved. After getting his note announcing
his determination to find me at all hazards,
the thought of meeting him had almost taken my
breath; but my sense of personal right, when once
roused, was very strong; so that instead of being
confused, flustered, at this unexpected meeting, I
was politely self-possessed.</p>

<p>"I replied to your letter, Mr. Berrian," I said as

<!-- page 269 -->

soon as we had exchanged greetings, "but I hardly
think you could have received it as soon as this."</p>

<p>The coolness of my manner did not disturb him
in the least; or, if so, he did not show it, but
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'No: I decided not to wait, but started immediately
upon receiving the postmaster's dispatch."</p>

<p>"Dispatch! he telegraphed, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes: did you suppose that I should tolerate any
unnecessary delay when I had once decided that a
thing must be done? neither was I desirous of raising
any needless obstacles, so I dodged your letter;
for, being ignorant of its commands, I could not be
censured if I disobeyed them. Why did you steal
away like a thief in the night, and thus spoil my
well-laid plans?"</p>

<p>"I left," I replied, "because I did not wish to
raise a conflict between you and your people."</p>

<p>"How, in what way, would you be likely to do
that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because of being placed in a false position.
That wretch, Crandall, had scattered his slime among
them, so prejudicing them against me that I could
feel it in the very air, as I walked the streets; and I
thought I knew you well enough to be assured that
you would defend the right at all hazards, so I took
myself out of the way."</p>

<p>"Thanks, fair lady, for your good opinion of me;
and yet I wish it had not been quite so good, in one
particular at least."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"One's intentions, motives, may be good, and purpose

<!-- page 270 -->

to do, strong; but the power to execute may be
weak. It seems that you had so much confidence in
my ability that you thought I needed no assistance,
so left me to fight the battle alone."</p>

<p>"You have placed the subject before me in a new
light, I will acknowledge," I said; "but I see no
reason why there need to have been a conflict after
my leaving."</p>

<p>He smiled, and replied, "You will pardon me,
please, if I point out what seems to me as evidence
of quite a different estimate of my humble self than
you professed a short time since; and I am sorry to
find that you really have so poor an opinion of me."</p>

<p>"Poor opinion of you!" I repeated in a tone that
I had not intended, but which would have betrayed
to the most careless observer the state of my feelings
toward him. The look he gave me told me what I
had done.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied without seeming to notice my
confusion: "had the case been reversed, would you
have kept silent, and have heard me unjustly
blamed? I know that you would not; you would
defend the absent when wronged, no matter who it
might be: and yet, though declaring that you knew I
would stand by the right, you coolly tell me, that, if
you left, there would be no necessity for a conflict
between my people and myself."</p>

<p>"I certainly never thought of it in that light," I
said at length; "I supposed, if I left, the subject
would be dropped, and nothing further said about
it."</p>

<p>A hearty laugh was his first response to this, and

<!-- page 271 -->

then, "Little you knew of the world as found in the
church, if you imagined that so rich a bit of scandal
would be dropped so readily; people are too hungry
for a sensation for that."<p>

<p>Rockman had sat quietly by, making no comment,
but now he remarked, "Your leaving was taken as
conclusive evidence of guilt; and Mr. Berrian had so
much the harder task to defend you."</p>

<p>"They might come to what conclusions they chose
about me, if"&mdash;I stopped in confusion; for, in my
impatience at being defeated with my own weapons,
I was on the point of making an admission that I
did not wish to.</p>

<p>"You did not care if they would only let me
alone," he said, finishing the sentence for me.
"Thanks for that admission; it opens the way for
me to hope that you will allow me to take the same
interest in yourself, only with this difference: instead
of running away to induce them to let you
alone, I will stand my ground; and they shall let
you alone, so far as this or any other scandal is concerned,
or I will make them give a reason why."</p>

<p>"How can you do your people any good," I persisted,
"if you so arouse their prejudices that they
will not listen to you?"</p>

<p>"And how can I do them any good, if I allow a
cruel wrong to go unrebuked because I am too weak
or too cowardly to speak?" he asked in reply.</p>

<p>"It is of no use for me to contend with you two,"
I said, "for, what one can not think of, the other
will."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that," said he, "for it emboldens

<!-- page 272 -->

me to make a proposition to which I feared you
would not give your consent; but, if you acknowledge
that it is of no use for you to contend further,
it gives me a hope that you will go back to B&mdash;&mdash;
with me, and help me to fight this battle to the
end."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can not!" I said.</p>

<p>"I want you to go as my wife," he continued
without heeding my remark. "As such, people will
know that I believe in you; and together we may
be able to unearth this man Crandall, to show him
in his true character to those who now believe in
him, and condemn an innocent woman because she
has befriended his victims."</p>

<p>He had used the best argument that he could have
brought to bear. I do not mean that the simple fact
of his proposing to try and show Crandall's real character
would have induced me to marry him or any
one else, or that I would have married one man for
the purpose of being revenged upon another. No
such motive could have influenced me for a moment
where love was wanting; but the reader will remember
that I loved Arthur Berrian, and that he loved
me; and they will remember, further, that Robert
Crandall, in casting suspicions upon my character,
had placed me in a position, that the more I loved
Arthur Berrian, the more reason it furnished me for
refusing to marry him, judging of pure love, self-sacrificing
love, from the standpoint I did.</p>

<p>I felt that he was a useful man, and that, to do
the good of which he was capable, his reputation,
and that of all connected with him, should be stainless.

<!-- page 273 -->

It would be my happiness to be his wife, but
my happiness must not come between him and the
good that he might do. But if I could secure my
own happiness, and, in so doing, aid him in accomplishing
greater good, could aid him in unmasking a
most consummate hypocrite, it placed the subject in
so different a light, that my objections were robbed
of all their weight.</p>

<p>Still I would not yield readily: so I asked, "Have
you reason to think that you can do that?"</p>

<p>"With your aid I think I can."</p>

<p>"And if you should fail?"</p>

<p>"I shall have saved myself the worse failure of
losing my self-respect because I did not try. Do
you not see," he continued, "that it is a test of
strength between my congregation and myself?
Shall I be able to lead them beyond the sphere of
narrow prejudice, to the open sunlight of fearless investigation?
or shall I permit them to hold me to
their present standard?</p>

<p>"Now, if I can prove to them that this man, who
pretends to have such an interest in the moral welfare
of the community, is a hypocrite, and that those
acts which they look upon as evidence of the blackest
of crimes were only prompted by the human
love, the Christian charity, which, if more were exercised,
the world would be the better for it, then I
have gained an advantage which will enable me to
lead them into fields of open conflict with the prevailing
sins of the age: otherwise I shall show that
I am not strong enough to lead, and must be content
to serve."</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<p>"You desire to test your strength?" I said.</p>

<p>"I am called upon to test my strength; and, as
you have been made the occasion, I want you to aid
me by coming to my side, instead of standing off like
a dead weight with a long string attached."</p>

<p>I laughed at the quaintness of the illustration, and
asked, "Why not show your valor, test your strength,
by cutting the string, and letting the dead weight
go?"</p>

<p>"Because my heart is with the dead weight, and
refuses to return to me; and a heartless minister is
of but little account," was his prompt response.</p>

<p>"But I am not a Christian," I persisted. "I do
not believe in the divinity of Jesus, nor in the infallibility
of the Bible; and a pretty minister's wife I
would make."</p>

<p>"Tell me that you do not believe in the divinity
of the love he manifested, of the sweet charity that
he was ever showing toward the weak, the unfortunate,
the erring ones who thronged his path; tell me
that your heart does not respond to these characteristics
of his nature; and tell me, further, that you do
not love me, can not return my love; tell me all this,"
said he, looking at me with a gaze that held me, "and
then I will urge no more."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to say that I had no sympathy
with the character of Jesus," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me that you do not love me, then, and
I will urge no further."</p>

<p>I was silent. Mr. Rockman left the room; and he
came close to my side, took my hands in his, and said,
"Do not, oh! do not, with your false reasoning, so

<!-- page 275 -->

wrong yourself and me as to refuse what I ask! We
have a right to be happy, and, in being so, shall be
doubly able to bless others."</p>

<p>I was still silent; and then he drew my head to
his breast, for I had no power to resist him: he had
conquered.</p>

<p>When he returned to B&mdash;&mdash; the following day, he
carried with him my promise to be his in three
months; and thus ended my attempt to run away
from love, from duty, because the path that I was
called to walk in must be cleared to let in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Minnie and Rose were jubilant, and Rockman behaved
more like a boy of fifteen than any thing else;
while I, now that I felt I might, listened hourly to
the music with which the singing birds of gladness
were filling my soul.</p>

<p>My head and my heart were reconciled, and I was
more than glad,&mdash;I was happy.</p>

<p>Yes, I was happy; and I felt like modifying the
poet's words, and making them my own, for&mdash;</p>

<p>"I DON'T believe it."</p>

<p>Arthur came to visit me once during
his probation; and such were the words
he used one day, after Minnie had been
discussing her plans, telling her experiences,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>He had been sitting as if in thought for some minutes
after she left, and I was surprised to hear him
speak out so abruptly.</p>

<p>"Don't believe what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In the doctrine of total depravity."</p>

<p>"Be careful, sir, or you will lose your ministerial
caste, and I shall be blamed for it," I laughingly
replied.</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment, and then said, "What
put that idea into your head?"</p>

<p>"What idea? I expressed two, I believe."</p>

<p>"That you could be blamed for any honest conclusion
to which experience or investigation might
lead me."</p>

<p>"Simply because 'Eve did it' has become ingrained
into the very life of the race; so I guess the
idea got there without being put in; it came as Topsy
did; it growed."</p>

<!-- page 277 -->

<p>"Suppose I should tell you that you really are at
the bottom of my heterodoxy, little woman."</p>

<p>"I should say, sir, that I had not tried to exert any
such influence over you, but had sought to conform
my religious views to yours."</p>

<p>He looked up archly. "You haven't promised to
obey me yet, have you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I have not; neither do I intend to. I
mean to have the ceremony performed by one who
will leave that part out, sir."</p>

<p>"We shall see, we shall see how that will be; and,
to test you, I am going to lay a command upon you
now; and I want you to promise to obey, and implicitly
too."</p>

<p>I was going to retort playfully, but he looked so
serious that I only asked, "What is it?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not command, but rather entreat, that
you will never <i>try</i> to conform to my religious views
again. I want a woman who thinks for herself, and
not one who only reflects my ideas."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed, my good sir! that sounds nicely," I
said, my spirit of mirth returning; "but you hardly
acted upon it when you was here before. You strove
hard enough to make me think as you did."</p>

<p>"So I did, and so I shall continue to do, my dear;
but you were not trying to think as I did: you were
trying right the reverse, and only yielded when convinced."</p>

<p>"I understand you now," I said; "and I will make
the promise; so look out for some mighty conflicts,
and it may sometimes be yourself that will be convinced."</p>

<!-- page 278 -->

<p>"And, when I am, I shall yield, and be happy in so
doing; but I have not told you in what sense you
have been the means of changing some of my ideas.
There is something in your presence that acts, well,
I will say, as a key to my intellect, unlocking chambers
of thought before unexplored. It seems as
though my being was quickened with a new life, a
new light."</p>

<p>"I hope the latter will not prove an <i>ignis fatuus</i>,"
I said.</p>

<p>"No danger; it is a living, not a dead, element
from which it springs, for it brings life with it. And,
as to this total depravity doctrine, how can I believe
it, when I see such a woman as Miss Morris, one
whom the world counts as degraded, and the church
looks upon as belonging to the vilest of the vile,&mdash;when
I see her planning and sacrificing for the good
of others with an earnestness that puts my efforts to
the blush?"</p>

<p>"Is there not a passage of Scripture," I asked,
"that speaks of being ignorant of Christ's righteousness,
and going about to establish one of our own?"</p>

<p>"That may be true in some cases, but not in this,"
he replied. "She is not thinking of herself, of gaining
God's favor, or of evading his anger: these motives
do not seem to influence her at all; but simply
to do good for the love of doing so, to bless and
save others, is her object."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right in your estimate of Minnie,"
I said; "and, as you repudiate the doctrine of
total depravity, I will give you some insight into my
ideas upon nature's laws."</p>

<!-- page 279 -->

<p>"I really wish you would," he replied.</p>

<p>"You, sir, have called my influence upon you a
key. I believe that nature's protests, as expressed
through the human soul, are nature's prophecies."</p>

<p>"How is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I believe that nature's protests are nature's prophecies;
to wit, nature protests against the violation
of her laws; she does this in various ways, but it is
sure to come in some form. Now, would this continue
to be done from generation to generation, and
from age to age, if such protests were of no use?&mdash;if
it were not a declaration that we have the innate
power to fulfill, and a prophecy that this power will
yet be so unfolded that the knowledge will come
through which the power can and will be applied."</p>

<p>He opened his blue eyes wider and wider as I proceeded;
and, when I ceased, he burst into a hearty
laugh. I could not quite see what I had said that
was laughable; and I think my countenance must
have expressed as much, for he hastened to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A nice piece of work you would make, trying to
conform to some one else's religious views, with such
clear, well-defined ideas of your own; but please
go on, and I will try and not be so rude again."</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir, as I can say any more now;
for you have scattered my ideas as completely as the
report of a pistol would a flock of birds."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to wait, then, till they
collect again; but you may be sure that I shall be on
the watch."</p>

<p>"Yes," I added, "I have one thought left; nature's
promptings are nature's fingerboards, pointing the
way to the fulfillment of her prophecies."</p>

<!-- page 280 -->

<p>"And, with such ideas, you have tried to conform
to my religious views. Do you not know that your
fingerboards point directly the other way, or, as the
darky said to his questioner, would spoil all 'de
feology' in the world?"</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh as I said, "If you do not
use the key, nor go as the fingerboard points, they
will neither of them harm you, sir."</p>

<p>"But the key is self-acting; and, if the fingerboard
should be of the same nature, what is a man going
to do?"</p>

<p>"Keep entirely out of the way of both," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I can not close the chambers of thought
that have been unlocked; I can not quench the light
with which they have been illumined; and, as one of
nature's promptings has led me to your side, I shall
not fear to go where the next fingerboard points."</p>

<p>"Follow, then, at your own risk; but here comes
Rockman and Rose," I said, as I ran down to meet
them.</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion for you from Minnie, Mr.
Berrian," said Rockman as soon as they were seated,
"and I think it a good one."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to hear it, Mr. Rockman."</p>

<p>"Well, we have been talking of the position you
occupy in reference to Robert Crandall, and the
difficulty there will be in counteracting the prejudice
he has raised against our friend here; and she
wished me to ask you if you had stated to any one
any of the circumstances of his life as you know
them from us?"</p>

<p>"I have not; there has been but little said to me

<!-- page 281 -->

on the subject that he excited the people's prejudices
over; and, when it has been referred to, I have
simply said, that there was another side to that
matter, which, when known, would put things in
quite a different light; and, when questioned as to
what I referred, I have replied that I should wait
till I knew something more before I said any thing
further than to declare that I knew the inferences
that had been drawn in reference to at least one
of the ladies were entirely unjust."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my way is clear for the suggestion.
Minnie says, that, if you approve, she will prepare in
substance what she knows of Robert Crandall, connecting
it with Rose, herself, and aunty here, but so
wording all that persons or places will not be suspected;
she will make it short, put it in circular
form; and you are to take them, and see that they
are well distributed through your congregation, telling
them that they were given you by parties that
you have recently met; that they purport to be,
and you have reason to believe that they are, a
statement of facts."</p>

<p>"I will think of this," said Arthur. "Has she
any particular time when she thinks that they should
be circulated?"</p>

<p>"She thinks that the sabbath before your marriage
will be the best time, and that it would be
well to state that you have been informed that one
or more of the parties named in the circular will be
there on the following sabbath."</p>

<p>"Give me an hour or two to decide, and then I
will tell you what I think," he said, taking his hat

<!-- page 282 -->

and leaving the house; but, before doing so, he came
around to where I was sitting, and stood at least
five minutes, making no remark, but, taking a portion
of my work in his hand, seemed intent upon
its examination.</p>

<p>"Is it well done?" asked Rose.</p>

<p>He looked at her, then at me, smiled, and walked
out of the door. I understood him. I knew that
he was seeking that which he had called the key, to
wit, what Swedenborg would designate as the influence
of my sphere; and I can not tell you what a
thrill of pleasure it gave me.</p>

<p>He returned in about an hour, and brought Minnie
with him. We discussed the pros and cons for
perhaps another hour; and then Arthur said, "We
will move along in our own path, doing what we
think is right; and, if occasion requires, we shall
find means to defeat the enemies that rise up against
us; till there is need to act, we will not plan to
meet or to forestall the evil. God will take care of
it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Minnie; "and any
thing that I can do to put down that hypocrite will
not be wanting, you may rest assured."</p>

<p>"And if we proceed against him in a spirit of
bitterness we shall certainly fail," was his reply.</p>

<p>"I wish I could put away all bitterness out of my
heart, and for ever, Mr. Berrian," she replied as the
tears started; "but when I think of the wrongs to
which thousands, yea, hundreds of thousands, of my
sex are subjected, I feel sometimes as though I
would like to spit wormwood and gall upon such a

<!-- page 283 -->

condition of things, till it was sunk to the depths of
hell."</p>

<p>"You speak strongly, Miss Morris, and I do not
wonder at all that you feel these wrongs intensely;
but remember that this life is not all," Arthur replied
with a deep sympathy in his voice that set the
tears she was endeavoring to suppress rolling in
streams down her cheeks.</p>

<p>These were followed by choking sobs that seemed
to rend her very soul. I had never seen Minnie
weep before; and now it was as though the pent-up
agony of years had broken through and would not
be stayed. We could not help it, we all wept with
her; and those tears did more to bind our hearts in
one, than all else that had occurred. I resolved
then and there, that, let what would come, I would
under no circumstances shrink from recognizing
Minnie Morris as a friend and sister; and when I
told my husband of that resolve, one week after our
marriage, he blessed me for it.</p>

<p>"It may be hard to do;" he said; "but we must
overcome the world, or it will overcome us; and,
when it has done this, it will bind us hand and foot,
requiring the most abject submission to its commands
and demands."</p>

<p>"The very words that Mr. Rockman used when
contending with me for holding out against your
love!" I exclaimed. "Not exactly the very words
either; but he said that when I had found myself I
would overcome the world, I would cast it out,
would so renounce it that its smile or its frown
would no longer influence my decisions."</p>

<!-- page 284 -->

<p>"Well, I guess you have found yourself," he responded.</p>

<p>"I have found you," I answered, "and that is
more than finding myself."</p>

<p>But I have digressed, have left myself and friends
in tears, to tell what occurred weeks afterward. I
will return now, and find that the tears have been
wiped away and calmness restored.</p>

<p>Rockman was the first to speak. "Do you not
think, Minnie, that you will yet grow strong enough
to overcome all this,&mdash;to meet and defy the world,
so respecting yourself that you will command the
respect of others?"</p>

<p>"I shall never stoop to win the world's approval,"
she said.</p>

<p>"That is what I would not ask, but I fear you are
doing so now."</p>

<p>"How?" she asked.</p>

<p>"By keeping your present work covered: you
stoop to hide."

<p>"Not for myself. Uncle Rockman: were only
myself concerned, I would defy them all; but these
others, I can not bear that they should be driven to
desperation."</p>

<p>"And here," I said, "we find one of nature's
fingerboards."</p>

<p>"Nature's fingerboards! what do you mean by
that?" she asked.</p>

<p>I looked at Arthur, and he laughingly said, "She
has been talking natural theology to me, and perhaps
she will now explain some of it to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! every thing is theology with a minister,"
said Rose.</p>

<!-- page 285 -->

<p>"Give us the explanation, and never mind what
they call it," said Minnie; while Rockman gave me
a look that seemed to ask if I, too, had become a
preacher.</p>

<p>"Yes, Saul is among the prophets," I replied to
his look, and then tried to give them an idea of what
I had meant by speaking as I did of Minnie's covered
work.</p>

<p>"I believe, Mr. Berrian, that my theology, or a
tenet of it, was that nature's promptings are nature's
fingerboards pointing the way to the fulfillment of
her prophecies." He bowed, and I continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, now to the application. You, Minnie, do
not feel happy in being obliged to cover your track,
to hide your past. In that unhappiness. Nature protests
against a wrong; it is not necessarily a wrong
in the one who conceals, but a wrong somewhere.
If in the individual, it needs to come to the light to
be righted; if the community ignorantly or selfishly
represses the individual, making him or her hide
that which should come to light, but dare not for
fear of unjust condemnation, then the ignorance
that thus represses honest effort should have the
lamp held firmly before its face, till it sees clearly
the law of justice, and becomes willing to accept the
new truth, or is forced to shut its eyes.</p>

<p>"The wrong of ignorance must be educated; that
of guilt, exposed. Nature, in protesting against
secrecy, prophesies that the time will come when
there will be no need of concealment; and, in the
spying propensities of the race, we have the fingerboard
that points the way to the fulfillment of her
prophecy.</p>

<!-- page 286 -->

<p>"Crime must be made so unhappy in concealment,
that it gives the clew to its retreat by its very
efforts to turn people's attention in another direction;
and Ignorance must be made so restless lest there
should be something concealed, that she must inevitably
stumble upon any light that is under a bushel,
and uncover it."</p>

<p>"Who now is quoting Scripture as an illustration?"
asked Rockman.</p>

<p>"I am, sir: what else could you expect from one
who is so completely under a minister's influence?"
I replied very demurely.</p>

<p>This turned the laugh against him; but he only
laughed too, and added, "I should think you had
been taking lessons of the minister for the last ten
years, by the way you talk."</p>

<p>"I protest against taking the credit of that," said
Arthur, "for she goes beyond me in natural analysis."</p>

<p>"I do not see where she has got it all, then; for
when I have talked with her she has always hung
back, instead of going ahead. Why, she has expressed
what I have been talking, and she has
hitherto opposed, even better than I could have
done," Rockman continued, looking as if he could
not quite understand why it was so.</p>

<p>I looked at Mr. Berrian, and remarked, "Sometimes
people swap keys."</p>

<p>"I wish you two people would stop talking in
riddles," said Rose; "now I presume that we shall
have to listen to another sermon to learn what swapping
keys means."</p>

<!-- page 287 -->

<p>"Never mind the keys," said Minnie: "they,
no doubt, refer to those with which each unlocked
the other's heart. I want to talk more about this
covering-up business. I wish I could see the way
clear to face the world, and defy its cruelty; for this
constant fear that something will occur to bring a
storm of condemnation upon us, is torture."</p>

<p>"Miss Morris, had you better not prepare a circular
giving some of your own experiences, and the
motives which prompted you to take the course you
have, and be ready, if a storm begins to gather, to
scatter them broadcast?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will do so, Mr. Berrian," she
said.</p>

<p>"You need not thank me. Miss Morris: I should
never have thought of it had not your desire to
serve me prompted a similar suggestion," he replied.</p>

<p>The next morning Arthur returned to B&mdash;&mdash;, saying
as he left, "The next time, my darling, I shall
not go alone."</p>

<p>"And then comes the tug of war," was my
thought; but I would not, by expressing it, cast a
single shadow upon his happiness. When he had
gone, I pondered over the remark about the effect
that my sphere had upon him, and I felt that there
was more in it than a lover's fancy; for though his
sphere, magnetism, or whatever it might be called,
did not exactly unlock new chambers of thought for
me, it seemed to sweep away the cobwebs from much
that Mr. Rockman had expressed from time to time,
giving me the power to see his idea so clearly, that I
could put it in my own language, and tell it, as he

<!-- page 288 -->

said, even better than he did; that is, more smoothly
if not more pointedly.</p>

<p>As to my shrinking from the responsible position
of being a minister's wife, I could not entirely avoid
it; but I comforted myself as best I could with the
thought of what he had said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be your own self; act not from what people will
think, but as your nature prompts and circumstances
indicate; and you will do well enough."</p>

<p>MINNIE prepared her circular, went to
B&mdash;&mdash;, found an obscure job-printer
who would do the work and say nothing
about it, and had as many struck
off as she thought she would need, then
returned to find that she had been none too soon in
doing so.</p>

<p>One of the girls had been recognized upon the
street the day before, and had been obliged to use
the utmost caution to prevent being followed home;
and this by a man who knew Minnie and at least
three of the girls well. "I am glad you came in the
night," she said to Minnie; "for he was really in
love with Julia Shaw; and, as we used to be
together, he will think we are now, and he will be
on the watch."</p>

<p>"Did she care for him?" asked Minnie.</p>

<p>"I thought you knew that she did not," Irene

<!-- page 290 -->

replied. "Don't you remember that rich old fool
who used to annoy us all so much when we were at
the capital?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean that he is the man you are talking
of!" exclaimed Minnie, turning pale.</p>

<p>"He is the very man, and I would rather have
met old Splitfoot himself; the contemptible, disgusting
puppy!"</p>

<p>Minnie sank into the nearest seat, and groaned
aloud, "Great heaven! how long must we be
crushed by men, the vilest and lowest of whom can
go where they please if they happen to have money,
while we must hide away, must steal the chance to
get an honest living, or be held to what we hate?"</p>

<p>The girls gathered around her with white, anxious
faces. "Go," she said at length, "and gather
them all here: those that this wretch happens to
know are here now, and the others can manage it so
as to come without attracting attention; but the
most of them had better come in the back way.
When we are all together, then we will decide what
is to be done."</p>

<p>I was summoned with the others; and now let the
reader imagine a midnight hour, and a room with
closed blinds, and so guarded that not a particle of
light could reach the eyes of those without, and in
that room about twenty women taking counsel
together as to how they can secure bread to eat, and
clothes to wear, without being subject to the lusts of
the men of a Christian community.</p>

<p>Think of these women as holding the secrets of
hundreds, yea, of thousands, who went whither they

<!-- page 291 -->

would, and were respected, honored, because their
acts were covered; think of the alternative placed
before these women, of going before the public as
humble suppliants, taking the place of sinners at the
feet of these very men and women; think of their
being obliged to do this, or be driven back to dens
of shame, to the gilded hells that they loathed.
Why are these things so?</p>

<p>Men control the staff of life, bread, or that which
brings it; and woman is everywhere dependent. Men
do not realize, many of them, what they are doing, I
know; they do not intend to be the tyrants they
are; neither do they have a true appreciation of
woman and her work, of what she could do for the
race if permitted to make conditions for herself.
They do not, they can not as yet, see this; but the
results of the present order of things are none the
less to be deplored, because people are blind to
causes, and deal unforgivingly with effects.</p>

<p>But the night waned, and each one of this company
must be in their respective places in the morning;
and what should be done?</p>

<p>Minnie had caught the spirit of the idea advanced
by Rockman,&mdash;that of overcoming the world by a
firm self-respect, and a refusal to obey its dictates, or
abide by its decisions. She tried to impress the girls
with this idea, and to inspire them with the hope
that there was a possibility of demanding, and finally
obtaining, what they might plead for in vain; to wit,
the respect of the public.</p>

<p>"We can at least retain our own," said she, "by
this course; while if we yield to their demands, or

<!-- page 292 -->

allow ourselves to be driven back to where we were
before, we can not do even that."</p>

<p>Some of the girls were silently defiant, and others
wept and cursed by turns; wept as they thought of
their condition, and then cursed the injustice that
would push them from the footing they had obtained.</p>

<p>"I will never again walk with bowed head and
shame-facedness before a hypocritical society!"
exclaimed Dora Fenn. "Nor I, nor I, nor I," was
repeated from lip to lip.</p>

<p>"I would not mind the old life so much," said
Helen Myres, "if I never had to receive company
that was repulsive to me, or when I did not wish it."</p>

<p>"That is not a curse to which the Magdalen alone
has to submit," I remarked.</p>

<p>"You have been married, and your life as a wife
was not a happy one?" said Minnie.</p>

<p>"It was not," I replied. "It is what I never like to
speak of, and would forget if I could; but, had the
man who called me wife lived, I should not have
been here now. He was, to all appearance, all that
a woman could desire,&mdash;fine-looking, affable, gentlemanly;
and, though I sometimes felt a sense of
shrinking while in his presence, I attributed it to
maidenly modesty. I was young, too young to
marry; but my parents desired it, and I, without
knowing what love meant, consented to become a
wife.</p>

<p>"It did not take long to open my eyes to what I
had done; but I thought it was woman's fate, and
that it was my duty to submit in silence. I did so,
trying to do the best I could; but Heaven was kinder

<!-- page 293 -->

to me than mortals, and death broke the bonds for
me."</p>

<p>I had never said as much before; but now my
sympathy for these girls drew from me what I should
otherwise have continued to keep concealed within
my own breast.</p>

<p>Minnie had not yet told them of the circulars, for
she did not wish to annoy them with the thought
that there might be a need for them; but now she
spoke of this, and explained her idea in reference to
their use, and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We call ourselves a band of sisters, and, let what
will come, I will never forsake you; so long as I have
a dollar you shall share it. How many of you feel
like abiding by this compact?"</p>

<p>There was not a dissenting voice. "Clasp hands,
then," she continued. All did this, even to Rose,
though she did not necessarily belong to them. I
looked on with tearful eyes, and said, "I will do all
I can consistent with my duties elsewhere."</p>

<p>Minnie smiled sadly, and said, "Marriage is our
natural enemy, and you can not serve two masters.
We are bound together in the bonds of affliction;
will those who have clasped hands rise?" They did
so; and she stepped into the middle of the room, telling
them to complete the circle around her.</p>

<p>"My sisters, my children, we are henceforth and
inseparably one; and may God in heaven help us, for
mankind will not!" They all bowed their heads as
if receiving a benediction; and then, when they were
reseated, she unfolded her plans.</p>

<p>"We will never humble ourselves to what society

<!-- page 294 -->

demands," she said; "but we will make it impossible
for them to say with truth that we are deceiving
them. I have set forth in this circular our past;
declaring that we were not alone to blame, and that
we are making an honest effort to lead a life of rectitude.
I have alluded to the feeling we have about
being humbled or set aside because of that for which
those who aided in placing us in the condition we
were are not condemned; and declared that such
treatment tended to drive those who had been
wronged to desperation; and asserted that we only
desired the opportunity to earn an honest living, and
if they would not allow this, if through the public
frown our customers were driven from us, thus
depriving us of the means of gaining our bread, then
the sin would be upon their own heads; and God
would require it at their hands.</p>

<p>"Now, girls, we are in danger of having the people's
prejudices aroused through the influence of this
degraded creature in the form of a man; this creature
that any of us would die sooner than marry, and yet
society accepts him, for he is a man, and has money;
and I propose to forestall him with these circulars.
Every minister and every minister's wife must have
one; every boarder we have, and every one who furnishes
us with sewing, must have one; and we will
watch the effect.</p>

<p>"If we are utterly forsaken, or so nearly so that
we see no hopes of continuing in our present work,
then we will not bow to the public demand of humiliation;
but we will seek a large city, establish ourselves
in different parts of it, and receive such company

<!-- page 295 -->

as is agreeable to us, pledging ourselves to each
other, that under no condition whatever shall a
money consideration induce us to accept that which
is repulsive. That kind of degradation we will never
consent to. And thus we shall not be utterly
crushed; for with cleanly habits, and the exclusion
of liquors from our table and the house, we can
remain healthy, and maintain our self-respect.</p>

<p>"Remember, now, this is not to be of choice, but
as a last resort, when we find that a Christian society
will not allow us any other resource, only as we kiss
Mother Grundy's big toe, and remain content to lie
at her feet. Who approves of this?"</p>

<p>"We will do or die; we will defeat the world by
refusing their terms on either hand; we will not
kneel to our equals, or to those who are beneath us,
so far as the reality goes; neither will we be prostituted
to the lusts of those we hate, so help us God!"
was the hearty response given to Minnie's plans.</p>

<p>"Then let there be no more hiding after this
night; let each go home as quietly as possible; and
from this time forth let each go where it is necessary,
without shrinking from the face of man or woman.
Good-night, and let the morrow take care of itself."</p>

<p>The excitement that filled the place the next day
was something wonderful. You would have thought,
had you heard some of the people talk, that the
plague had broke out in their midst, or that an earthquake
was imminent. The boarders were questioned
upon every corner of the street,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you know who you were boarding with?"</p>

<p>"Never had the least idea till this morning," was
the prompt response.</p>

<!-- page 296 -->

<p>"How have they behaved?"</p>

<p>"Like ladies: we have never seen the least thing
immodest or unladylike."</p>

<p>"What did they tell on themselves for, the
fools?"</p>

<p>"Some one came into town, I understand, who
used to know some of them, I believe."</p>

<p>"Are you going to continue boarding with them?"</p>

<p>Different answers were given to this. Some said,
"As long as they continue to behave like ladies."
Others asked, "Would you drive them to desperation
by withdrawing all means of support?" and
still others would reply, "Not longer than till my
week is up;" and one or two said, "Yes, if they will
let me sleep with them."</p>

<p>The most of the boarders were young men, and
were inclined to stand by the girls; and one of the
very best among them urged Irene Bradley to marry
him: but she said, "No, I will not forsake those I
have pledged myself to: we are a band of sisters, and
we stand or fall together."</p>

<p>Some ten of the young men were at work in the
foundry of which the dissipated old Cr&oelig;sus who had
recognized Irene was proprietor; and, when he found
that he was defied, his rage vented itself by demanding
that those ten should board elsewhere, or be discharged.
True, he had no direct right to hire or
discharge any of the workmen, as he had leased the
property to another for a given length of time; but
the man who held the lease was financially in his
power, and so was obliged to do his bidding.</p>

<p>He resided elsewhere, and had not been in the

<!-- page 297 -->

place before for nearly two years; and this was why
the girls had lived so long in peace. The most of
the ten submitted, and changed their place of boarding;
though they assured the girls that they did
it of necessity, not of choice. Three of them, however,
refused to yield to such arbitrary dictation, and
found employment elsewhere. In three days' time,
there were but seven of their twenty boarders left;
and six out of the other thirteen had offered to pay
the same that they had paid for board, and even
more, for the privilege of coming secretly, and staying
with some one of the girls once a week.</p>

<p>Ministers and their wives came together, and consulted
as to what was to be done, and decided, that
if they were only humble, repentant, it would be
proper and right to stand by them; but that with
the proud, independent spirit they manifested, it
would only be encouraging sin to countenance them.</p>

<p>Some two dozen of the most pious ladies in the
place called on them in a body, and told them that
it was not proper for them, under the circumstances,
to receive men into their homes unless accompanied
by their wives or mothers, and that if they would
dismiss the rest of their boarders, and would work at
reasonable prices, they would furnish what work they
could, and use their influence to aid them getting
more elsewhere.</p>

<p>Men, merchants, lawyers, physicians, and others
whose business gave them money to spend on pleasure,
these to the number of at least a dozen, during
the first ten days sent them notes through the office,
or dropped them in the yard, offering them money if

<!-- page 298 -->

they could be allowed to visit them under cover of
darkness; but these notes were always so worded,
that there was no certainty as to who sent them, and
specified some sign by means of which they might
know if their offers were accepted; and so the conflict
went on.</p>

<p>Eben Rockman went upon the street in his old
disguise, and listened to the comments made;
learned the decision of the conclave of ministers and
wives, heard Minnie's report of the proposition of the
pious women, read the notes making offers to the
girls, noted the pressure brought to bear upon the
young men; and he said it not only once but dozens
of times,&mdash;</p>

<p>"God damn this thievish Christian nation!" and,
with all I saw and heard as an illustration of the
general Christian character, I could not find it in my
heart to reprove him; for I felt, that if some strong,
determined soul did not speak, the stones beneath
our feet would cry out in agony.</p>

<p>Minnie wrote to Mr. Berrian, telling him how
things were going, and sent him some of the circulars
she had distributed, and also some that she had prepared
for him to use, if he should need them. This
she had done from her own promptings, we not
knowing of it till afterward.</p>

<p>The three months, that I had stipulated for had
expired with the exception of one week. Arthur
had secured a substitute to fill the desk for one sabbath,
and had written to the minister here, that he
should require his services to perform a marriage-ceremony.
The sabbath before leaving B&mdash;&mdash;, he
had preached from these words in the morning:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 299 -->

<p>"Man looketh at the outward appearance; but God
looketh at the heart;" and in the afternoon he had
taken, "Judge not, that ye be not judged."</p>

<p>That he spoke of the deceitfulness of appearances,
of the plans of the hypocrite to cast his sins upon
others, of the necessity of care lest we should condemn
the innocent, the reader will doubtless not
need to be told. At the close of the discourse, he
announced that he should be absent the following
Sunday, and, that, upon his return, he should bring a
wife to be the sharer of his labors among them.</p>

<p>"And still another subject," he said, "I wish to present;
or, rather, to state, that some circular pamphlets
have been sent to me recently, in reference to some
facts that illustrate the text of this afternoon. These
circulars do not name the parties concerned; but I
have reasons to believe that they are a statement of
facts. Those reasons I will give you at another
time; but the circulars will be given to the brother
who officiates here next sabbath, and he will hand
the package to Deacon Barnes to distribute.</p>

<p>"I desire that you read them carefully, and, when
I return, I shall have something to say in reference
to them."</p>

<p>This excited the curiosity of the people, as he
expected it would; and the next sabbath every one
was desirous of getting hold of a circular, and Crandall
with the others. Minnie had stated the facts,
but she had so worded the entire relation, that no
one, unless acquainted with some of the main features,
would have suspected the parties or the place;
and every one inquired of his neighbor, "Who is this

<!-- page 300 -->

smooth-faced hypocrite? Who are those women who
were so wronged?"</p>

<p>Crandall knew who was intended; but he was
shrewd enough to see that there was nothing in the
circular to point to him: so he joined in the general
expressions of indignation and pity with as much
earnestness as though he was really the righteous
man that he appeared.</p>

<p>Upon reaching C&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Berrian talked with
Rockman and myself, as to what course to pursue
toward Minnie and her friends.</p>

<p>"The public are connecting Rose and myself with
them," I said, "although Minnie has expressly stated,
time and again, that we were only incidental acquaintances,
who had become friends through sympathy
with their resolution to leave the old life and begin a
better one."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said he: "we will turn that tide.
I shall ask the privilege of speaking in the morning;
and, though not very much used to speaking without
previous preparation, I feel that through the help of
my God I can do so, and do it well too. The spirit
of my Master is upon me, and I shall love to tell
those who fear contamination that the publicans and
harlots go into the kingdom before them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rockman and Rose will be with you, of
course; and I want Miss Morris and all her friends to
be there, and to be among the first to give us greeting
after the ceremony is over. You can go to church
as usual in the morning; I will stay at Brother
Weston's to-night, and no one need know who the
bride is to be till she is called for."</p>

<!-- page 301 -->

<p>His courage inspired me, and all was arranged as
he had planned, in the morning he occupied the
pulpit in company with Mr. Weston, the regular
minister; and after singing and prayer he announced
to the congregation, that, as the Rev. Mr. Berrian
from B&mdash;&mdash;, was with them, they would have the
pleasure of listening to a discourse from him.</p>

<p>Minnie and the girls were all there, quiet and well
behaved, and paying no attention to the scornful
looks directed toward them. Mr. Rockman, Rose,
and myself occupied our usual places, and were
treated to our proportion of condemning glances.</p>

<p>Mr. Berrian arose, and, looking slowly over the
audience, announced these words as the text from
which to make a few remarks: "or as the Spirit
giveth utterance."</p>

<p>"If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is
none of his."</p>

<p>Pausing till he had the attention of every one in
the house, he again repeated the words, "If any
man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to show, as illustrated by his
life, what that spirit was; and it seemed to me, as I
listened, that, like the prophet of old, his lips had
been touched with a live coal from off the altar.</p>

<p>"Jesus shrank not from speaking the truth because
it touched the rich, the great ones of earth, but
showed that, like his Father in heaven, he was no
respecter of persons. Do we do this? Oh, no! the
rich man's broadcloth, and the wealthy woman's
silks and laces, so dazzle our eyes that we can not see
their sins; so we accord to them the best places

<!-- page 302 -->

everywhere. Their money pays for what they have;
but money will not tempt the spirit of Christ to
give them a place in heaven.</p>

<p>" 'If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is
none of his.'</p>

<p>"He was never heard to thunder his condemnation
against the weak and erring among the poor and
lowly; he always spoke gently to, and looked kindly
on them, winning them with the dew of his love, as
the sunlight woos the desolate places of the earth,
till, if there is the germ of a flower there, it will open
its petals and show its richest hues. The rich, the
high and lifted-up, needed severe language to bring
them to a sense of what they were; but these, their
hearts were bruised and sore already, and they needed
the gentle dews of love to revive their drooping
spirits. The bruised reed he will not break.</p>

<p>"Do we manifest a gentle spirit toward the same
classes? do we win the drunkard from his cups by
surrounding him with better influences? do we draw
the Magdalen from her wretched life with gentle
words and loving deeds? do we?</p>

<p>" 'If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is
none of his.'</p>

<p>"Do we find Jesus at any time guarding himself
from disreputable society lest his character should
suffer reproach? do we find him demanding that
they should humble themselves and stand afar off,
because of the past? did he put them under the surveillance
of watchful eyes and suspicious looks? Not
at all; but, dismissing them with a smile of blessing
and a word of admonition, he sent them about their
business, threw them upon their own responsibility.</p>

<!-- page 303 -->

<p>"Do we do this? Do we not, on the contrary, keep
the hounds of suspicion on their track till they are
driven to despair by our constant espionage of their
acts, and misinterpretation of their motives? do we
not demand from them so much humiliation, that
their self-respect rebels, and refuses to submit? And
because of this, because our burdens are so hard that
they can not bear them, because, instead of being
meek and lowly in spirit, we are so self-righteous
that they can not come near unto us,&mdash;because of all
this, we turn our backs upon them, and claim that
they do not desire a better life.</p>

<p>" 'If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is
none of his.' "</p>

<p>But no description of mine can do justice to that
sermon. It was not so much the words as the manner
in which they were said, the looks and gestures
which accompanied, that gave them force and power.</p>

<p>The audience could but make the application for
themselves; and, long before he sat down, the questioning
glance, the cold looks, that had been directed
toward Minnie and her company at commencement,
ceased entirely. For once they forgot the shortcomings
of others in the realizing sense that they
themselves had not the spirit of Christ. For my
own part, I felt that, with such a man to stand by my
side, I need not fear to face the world.</p>

<p>At the close of the services, the resident minister
said that he hoped the audience would all be there in
the afternoon; for, though he could not hope to interest
them as the brother had done, the lack would be
made up in part, at least, by that which always
interested,&mdash;a marriage-ceremony.</p>

<!-- page 304 -->

<p>This changed the whole current of thought.
"Who is to be married?" was the question that flew
from lip to lip: no one knew but the minister, and
he was bound to secrecy. In the afternoon the
church was filled to the overflowing. Arthur sat in
the desk as in the morning, while the minister went
forward with the usual services. The sermon was
ended at last, and expectation was on tiptoe.</p>

<p>Very quietly Arthur arose, descended from the
desk, came to where I was sitting, and taking me by
the hand led me forward to the altar, while Rockman
and Rose took their places on either side of us.
I will not attempt to picture the surprise, almost
consternation, that was pictured upon the faces of the
congregation. Suffice it to say that the effect of
that day's occurrences, together with the influence
exerted the few days that we remained in town, so
smoothed the path for Minnie that she managed to
maintain her ground till the reaction came that gave
her the real respect she deserved.</p>

<p>True, there were some who never could be made
to comprehend that once in disgrace was not always
in disgrace; but they were the weak, the cowardly,
or the self-conceited ones, whose law was to follow,
not to lead. You will say that self-conceit desires to
lead. I mean the self-conceit that claims the right
to stand beside the leaders, to be first in their notice;
those who receive smiles from those who stand above
them, to dispense frowns to those they imagine below
them. Such are generally too feeble to lead, or too
indolent to take the necessary trouble.</p>

<p>When we returned to B&mdash;&mdash;, Rose and Rockman

<!-- page 305 -->

went with us. We stopped upon the way to visit an
old friend of Arthur's, and when we reached home
it was late on Saturday night; so that no one saw us,
and consequently had no idea who the bride was till
we entered church on sabbath morning.</p>

<p>Very calmly Arthur arose in his place, gave out
the hymn, and offered up the accustomed prayer,
then took for his text, "Deal justly, love mercy, and
walk humbly."</p>

<p>"Do we do this?" he asked. "We do not ask if
the world at large does this, but do we who profess
to be the followers of Christ Jesus do this? First,
as to dealing justly, let us test the matter by facts
from real life. I once knew two girls of the same
neighborhood, who were counted as the most beautiful
of all in the country around; but they were poor.
These girls were both sought by rich young men;
and one of them loved him who sought her society,
and the other did not.</p>

<p>"The one who did not was ambitious of place and
position; and resolved to marry the man she did not
love, for the sake of his money. Remember she had
no love for him, consequently it was no trouble for
her to keep him at his proper distance till she had so
bound him that he could not leave her. She coolly,
calculatingly, sold herself to this man under the sacred
name of marriage. It was not marriage; there was
no union between them; only the symbol of a union
which was not, and never could be. She told her
friends that she did not love him, but that she could
and would marry him.</p>

<p>"They were professed Christians, those friends,

<!-- page 306 -->

the most of them; but did they turn from her in
scorn? did they tell her that a legal sale of herself
with perjury upon her lips could not sanction such
an accursed bond? Did they? If so, it was with
a frown so mingled with a smile that it lost its power
to influence; and as to scorning, and turning their
backs upon her, they did far otherwise.</p>

<p>"The banquet was spread for her and the man to
whom she had sold herself, in many a so-called
Christian home; and she in turn entertained them
as guests. But how was it with the other one? She
loved: she was pure and sweet as the morning in her
intentions; the thought of selling herself for gold,
for wealth or position, would have been sacrilege to
her; but she loved, and he to whom her heart's worship
was given succeeded, by arts at which a fiend
ought to blush, in accomplishing her ruin. And
what was the result? ay, what was the result?</p>

<p>"Did Christians take that poor wounded lamb to
their bosoms, and comfort her? did they turn their
indignation against her betrayer? Would to God
that I could say that they did! but alas, no: the
betrayer walked forth unharmed; the woman who
had sold herself for gold was accepted, because she
had conformed to human law; while she who had
loved, had fulfilled God's law, but had been betrayed
into neglecting the human, she was scorned, till,
driven to desperation, she hid herself from Christian
cruelty in a den of infamy.</p>

<p>"Did those who called themselves Christians deal
justly with that poor girl? did they love mercy?
did they walk humbly when they presumed to judge
her?"</p>

<!-- page 307 -->

<p>Here he paused, and looking directly at Crandall
for a moment, added, "And there was another who
was betrayed, and then confined in a den of infamy,
by him who professed to love her; she manages to
escape, and finds refuge with a friend, while he
marries another. He professes a great deal of
morality, and warns the public against this very girl
and her friend; and a Christian public without investigation,
without bringing the accuser and the
accused face to face, accepts the man's story as
truth, and crushes the woman with scorn.</p>

<p>"Is this doing justly? is this loving mercy? is this
walking humbly, as in the presence of God who
looketh at the heart? Is this an unusual subject for
a sabbath morning's discourse? Then the more
shame to those who stand upon the walls of Zion.
The Lord hath called me to preach the gospel to the
poor, to plead the cause of the oppressed; and I shall
obey God, rather than man."</p>

<p>The effect of this discourse, in connection with the
circulars that had been scattered, and the marriage
with the woman upon whom they had set the seal of
their condemnation because the "Hon. Mr. Crandall"
had warned them against her,&mdash;the effect of
all this was simply tremendous. Men and women
turned pale before the firm daring of the minister.
No direct charge was made, but all knew that Crandall
was the one intended by the last example given.
How dare Arthur Berrian brave such a man, and the
whole community with him?</p>

<p>In the evening the text was, "Shall I obey God or
man? judge ye." The church was even more

<!-- page 308 -->

crowded than in the morning; but the temper of the
audience was like powder, and needed only a spark
to create an explosion. But the spark was not
furnished; for, as he proceeded to portray the terrible
responsibility resting upon the minister, his tones
seemed almost a prayer, an entreaty that they would
consider the position he held, and pardon him for the
wounds that he felt he must inflict. Gradually, as
he proceeded, the clouds dispersed, the atmosphere
changed; and when he sat down the man had conquered
what the minister had aroused.</p>

<p>Crandall was there with the rest; but from that
day he came no more. The tide turned against him,
and his power was gone. He was nominated for
office again, but was defeated; and, as people began
to sense more and more his real character, he was
driven by an influence that he could not grapple
with, into the obscurity he deserved. And there, with
the disappointed woman that he made his wife from
no purer motives than those which prompted her
to accept him as husband,&mdash;there we will leave them
to just such happiness as they have prepared for
themselves; feeling that,&mdash;</p>

<p>ROSE remained with me in my new home
as the trusted friend and sister that she
had been for years. True, she was
pledged to Minnie's band, and, had they
needed her, she would have gone to
them at once; but for the present she could be of
no particular use to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Rockman, as usual, came and went at his
pleasure. Some ten days after our marriage, we
were all four sitting quietly together one evening,
when Mr. Rockman said to Arthur,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Berrian, are we not taught to pray for the
will of God to be done on earth as it is in heaven?"</p>

<p>"We certainly are," he replied.</p>

<p>"Can human law ever bring about such a result,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Human law is imperfect, and ever must be; but
God's law is perfect, and must be obeyed in order to
so glorious a result," he answered.</p>

<p>"Is there any need of adding the sanction of the
human, the imperfect, when God's, the perfect, is
satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I do not see the purport of your questions, Mr.
Rockman; but, I can not perceive such a need any

<!-- page 310 -->

more than John could when Jesus came to be
baptized. John objected; but the reply was, 'Suffer
it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
righteousness.' "</p>

<p>Eben laughed. "You have given the only answer
that you could have made without condemning yourself,"
he said.</p>

<p>"How is that?" Arthur asked.</p>

<p>"Love is the fulfilling of the law, of God's law;
it is all that he requires in marriage. This existed
between you and Mrs. Berrian; yet you added to it
the sanction of human law."</p>

<p>"God commands marriage," said Arthur, looking
as if he did not quite understand what particular
point Rockman wished to illustrate.</p>

<p>"What kind of marriage,&mdash;that of love, or that
which the State sanctions? It was the authority of
the State, and not that of God, by which you were
pronounced man and wife."</p>

<p>"Does not Paul say that marriage is honorable?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but is it law marriage, or love marriage?
If the first, then love has nothing to do in the
matter; if the latter, then we do not need the first;
and, if it takes both to complete the bond, then God's
law, the law of love, is not perfect till it has man's
sanction."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rockman, would you have us disregard the
laws that enforce justice and order?"</p>

<p>"I would have those who call themselves Christians
consistent. You pray for the will of the
Father to be done on earth as it is in heaven; you
say that human law can never bring about such a

<!-- page 311 -->

result; and He whom you call Master said, 'In that
world they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels in heaven;' and yet you continue
to recognize legal marriage. Now, I want to
know how the will of the Father is to be done on
earth as it is in heaven, how it is that we are to
become as the angels, so long as we continue to act
as though God's law of love needs the addition of
man's sanction?"</p>

<p>"You are asking hard questions, Mr. Rockman,"
Arthur said, after sitting some moments as if in deep
thought.</p>

<p>"Well, I will put the question in another form:
what is it that makes legal marriage necessary?"</p>

<p>"What is it that makes legal marriage necessary?
Who would take care of the women and children, if
a man was not held for the support of his own children
and their mother?"</p>

<p>"You have answered the question, Mr. Berrian; it
is property, the law of descent, that which sustains
the present order of things, sustains all its injustice,
its usury, its extravagance, pride,&mdash;all these and
much more demand legal marriage, can not exist without
it. The law of love, God's law, does not demand
it; in that world it does not exist, and they are as
the angels in heaven."</p>

<p>"When we become as the angels, Mr. Rockman,
we shall not need marriage law; till then, I do not
see how we can get along without it."</p>

<p>"When we know how to swim, Mr. Berrian, we can
be trusted upon the water; till then it is not safe to
go near it," he replied.</p>

<!-- page 312 -->

<p>Rose laughed; and Arthur looked confused, but
said in reply, "I should like to have you explain how
it is that legal marriage upholds, sustains, all the
wrongs you have named."</p>

<p>"Is one child any more worthy at birth than
another?" asked Rockman.</p>

<p>"Certainly not: they have done neither good nor
evil, and can not be counted worthy or unworthy,
having not, as yet, reached the years of accountability."</p>

<p>"What would you think, Mr. Berrian, of a man
who would give all his property to one child, and
leave the others penniless?"</p>

<p>"I should that he was an unjust, an unnatural
father, sir."</p>

<p>"And yet the time was when the eldest son inherited
the estate; it is so now in some countries. The
law of the land enforced this; and, no matter how
much the parent desired, he could not make his children
equally his heirs. This was done to perpetuate
a titled, an aristocratic class, by keeping large estates
undivided. Millions of acres are to-day, in England,
laid out in extensive parks, where the nobility can
sport at their leisure, while millions of the poor, the
landless, are subject to these rich lords, dependent
upon them, either directly or indirectly, for the
chance to earn their bread; and woe to the luckless
poacher who dares to snare a hare or shoot a bird
upon these broad domains, if he is caught!"</p>

<p>"But what has all this to do with legal marriage?"
interrupted Arthur.</p>

<p>"There is often a contest as to the real heirship of

<!-- page 313 -->

these large estates; and the fact of an actual, a legal
marriage must be established as existing between the
parents a sufficient length of time before the birth of
the child, to prove its legitimacy, or the inheritance
passes to another. Thus legal marriage takes
its value from the property basis, and love between
the parties is not taken into account. Who ever
heard of such a thing as the question being asked as
to whether the parents loved one another when the
legitimacy, and consequent heirship accruing to a
child, were being tried in a court of law?</p>

<p>"The opposing counsel would object in a moment;
would say, 'This is not a question of love, but of law.
Were the parties legally married? and is this child,
this man or woman, the fruit of that marriage?' In
this country we have no titled aristocracy; consequently
the selfish ambition to stand above one's
fellows must find its support in money, and that
which money brings; hence the struggle for wealth
for <i>ourselves</i> and <i>our children</i>. The law of descent
gives to children who are legitimate, those whose
parents were legally married,&mdash;it gives such children
the property that belonged to their parents. Here
again law takes precedence, even when love exists;
while love without legality has no rights that the law
is bound to respect, and law without love has all the
rights that law with love has; so you must see that
legal marriage utterly ignores, sets aside, the law of
love. And yet the Scriptures declare that 'love is the
fulfilling of the law.'</p>

<p>"It may be counted heresy, Mr. Berrian; but, to
me, the man or woman who takes upon them legal

<!-- page 314 -->

bonds casts contempt upon the law of God. I am
aware that they do it ignorantly; but they nevertheless
belittle the divine law of love, which is all the
law that God requires the parties to obey."</p>

<p>"No rights that the law is bound to respect," repeated
Rose. "I do not see, then, but love is in the
same condition that the negro was under the Dred
Scott decision."</p>

<p>"Exactly, puss: you have hit the nail right on the
head; and, as the value of the negro was always
counted from the money standpoint, so also is the
value of legal marriage."</p>

<p>"You mistake," said Arthur: "the negro was often
loved and tenderly cared for; and masters, in that
case, would part with almost any thing else sooner
than with a favorite slave; and legal marriage has a
moral value in the eyes of the people, that is above
money."</p>

<p>"I was speaking," said Rockman, "in reference to
law. The master might love his slave very dearly,
but the law paid no regard whatever to that love;
for if he was in debt, and could not raise the money
otherwise, the slave must be sold. As to legal
marriage, the people may get the idea that it has a
moral value, and cling to it on that account; but the
law itself recognizes no such value, any more than it
does a love-value in the person of the slave."</p>

<p>"Can a simply legal act, in and of itself, have a
moral value?" asked Rose.</p>

<p>Rockman turned to Arthur, instead of answering
her himself, with, "How is that, Mr. Berrian?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as I exactly understand the question,"
he said.</p>

<!-- page 315 -->

<p>"Will you repeat it, Rose?"</p>

<p>"Can a legal act, in and of itself, have a moral
value? Or, in other words, can legal sanction make
an immoral act a moral one, or the lack of such sanction
make a moral act an immoral one?"</p>

<p>"Wife, I wish you would come to my aid," said
Arthur, turning to me; "or, with two such sophists
to deal with, I shall get into deep water."</p>

<p>"Say, rather, that you are already in deep water,
and have never learned to swim," laughed Rockman.
"You know that we are not sophists; the difficulty
is, we go straight from premises to conclusions, and
it kindles more of the hay and stubble into a flame
than you like."</p>

<p>"Will you please answer my question?" said Rose.</p>

<p>"He can not," interrupted Rockman; "he is in as
bad a condition as the Jews were when Jesus questioned
them of the baptism of John, whether it was
from heaven or of men; if he says that legal sanction
can not make an immoral act a moral one, you can
ask him why a mother who has not been legally married
is necessarily less pure than one who has been
thus married; and, if he says that legal sanction can
make an immoral act a moral one, then you can ask
him why it is that human law does not step in and
change the character of all wrong-doing by sanctioning
and thus making it right."</p>

<p>"But I did not intend to ask either," said Rose.
"I only wished to ask if a legal morality did not
really do more harm than good by standing in the
way of real morality?"</p>

<p>"If we make the legal take the place of the moral,

<!-- page 316 -->

it certainly does; but, if we only use the legal as a
sign of the real, I can not see where the harm comes
in," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"True," said Rockman, "if the sign is never used
only where the real exists; but if, as in the present
state of society, the sign is used full as often to mislead
as otherwise, and when it is once up it must stay
there to bind the parties to a false relation, and they
are taught that it is their duty to live out the falsehood,
what then? I tell you, friend Berrian, the
declaration that 'by the works of the law shall no
flesh be justified,' contains a grand truth, and one
that pertains to more than the ceremonial law of the
Jews, or the ten commandments given upon Mount
Sinai. The enactments of to-day, the very best of
those laws that attempt to regulate the morals of a
community, are an utter failure. They tend to produce
more crime than they prevent; and of none can
this be more truly said than of legal marriage."</p>

<p>"You may be right, friend Rockman; but I can not
see, as yet, that you have made good your accusations
against legal marriage; and I shall be slow to decide
against what, to me, is among the most sacred of all
institutions," said Arthur in reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should have said that it was both the
cause and result of these evils; but it is certain to
my mind that such evils can never be done away with
while legal marriage exists. Time was when property
was held by the law of direct force. What a man
took and was able to hold was his, whether wives,
slaves, gold, silver, or whatever else was considered
of value; then there were no written codes to regulate

<!-- page 317 -->

the relations of property, nor courts, judges, and
lawyers, with the whole power of the government as
an indirect force to secure the fulfillment of their requirements.
But men and women can never become
like the angels in heaven under either of these systems:
they belong to the realm of the external, instead
of the internal or spiritual life.</p>

<p>"The law of descent of property from parents to
children, and the legal marriage system which strives
to secure this result, are both the offspring of selfishness.
You have acknowledged, Mr. Berrian, that it
would be unjust for a father to give all his property
to one child, and leave the others penniless: what is
a State but a larger family?"</p>

<p>"But the State does not own the property; it has
no right to confiscate or control that which belongs
to the individual, Mr. Rockman."</p>

<p>"The State has just those rights, in a republican
form of government, which individuals give it. It
has the right to protect its citizens; it has the right
to say that one man shall not rob another. Time
was when only the eldest son inherited the estate,
and the ruling power was vested in the king: the
time is when a man's children inherit equally what
he can earn, or get from others directly or indirectly,
so that he does it legally; and the power has passed
from the king to the people: time will be when the
State will be every man's heir, and all children of the
State will, at the age of twenty-one, receive a definite
sum to begin life with, and, previous to that time,
they will be secured equal advantages in every
respect."</p>

<!-- page 318 -->

<p>"Do you mean to say that children will be taken
from the parents, and educated by the State?"</p>

<p>"By no means, Mr. Berrian; but I mean to say
that children shall no longer be left to suffer from
the inability of parents to provide what they need;
that, if sickness or death intervene, children shall not
be orphaned; and, if parents fail to earn wealth, children
shall not be obliged to commence active life
under circumstances that will make them, as laborers,
the slaves of capital."</p>

<p>"Would to heaven that such a state of things existed
now!" exclaimed Arthur with deep emotion;
and I could but add a hearty "Amen!"</p>

<p>Rose only sighed, as the contrast between such an
order of things and the present one presented itself
to her mind.</p>

<p>"Do you think that we could do without legal marriage
then?" asked Rockman.</p>

<p>"I should be inclined to think that we could," was
the reply.</p>

<p>He then turned to me with, "Mrs. Berrian, is not
that one of your fingerboards?"</p>

<p>"I must know, uncle, just how you mean to apply
it, before I answer that question," I said.</p>

<p>"If I remember rightly, you said that Nature's
protests are Nature's prophecies; does not Nature
protest against the present order of things, declare
that it is imperfect by the pain and suffering that are
irreparable from it?"</p>

<p>"I understand it so," I replied,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And even your reverend husband here acknowledges
that, in the state of society that he wishes existed,

he believes we could do without legal marriage;
now I want to know if this does not indicate that
this is one of the steps to be taken in order to bring
about so desirable a state of things?"</p>

<p>"If I have stated a principle, Uncle Rockman,
and you apply it wrongfully, it is not my fault."</p>

<p>"But will you say that he has made a wrong application?"
asked Rose.</p>

<p>"And you too?" I said, shaking my finger at
her.</p>

<p>"We will not press her too hardly, Rose; she
has too recently assumed the bonds to be willing to
decide against them; but one thing is certain. We
can never have such a state of society so long as the
law of inheritance as regulated by legal marriage
exists.</p>

<p>"You may think this a strong assertion; but let
us suppose a case to illustrate the point in question.
Here is a man worth one hundred thousand dollars,
and he has five sons grown to manhood; and living
in the same place are ten men who have nothing but
what they earn from day to day, with perhaps
enough for funeral expenses; and these men have
also five sons apiece.</p>

<p>"Well, these men all die; the rich man's sons come
into the possession of twenty thousand dollars each,
and the poor men's sons have nothing. The rich
man's sons build each of them ten houses, which,
when finished, are worth, with the lots on which they
stand, fifteen hundred dollars each, leaving five thousand
for a residence for themselves. They then lease
these fifty houses to the fifty sons of the ten poor

<!-- page 320 -->

men, at twelve dollars a month, or one hundred and
forty-four dollars per year.</p>

<p>"We will take the forty-four dollars to pay taxes
and keep up repairs, thus giving each of the sons of
that rich man one thousand dollars per year out of
the earnings of the sons of those poor men. Let
this continue for fifteen years, and each rich man's
son has had the repairs kept up, and the taxes paid
on each one of those houses, and has received beside
the original cost the fifteen hundred dollars. And
who owns the houses?</p>

<p>"Do those day-laborers? No: they have paid for
them, and paid the taxes on them, have kept them in
repair all these years; and yet they have no home of
their own. Their labor, as expended upon the improvements
in the town, has increased the value of
all the property therein, and those same houses are
now valued at twenty-five hundred dollars instead
of fifteen; so they must pay a higher rate of rent,
or, with an increasing family, be crowded into a
smaller space.</p>

<p>"Now the sons of that rich man were no better
as boys, are no better as men, than the sons of the
poor men; they have not produced by actual labor
one dollar in all these years, but have traded upon
and lived off the labor of others; they are all equally
the children of the State: now, where is the justice
in such a state of things?</p>

<p>"Can men and women become like the angels under
such conditions? The sons of those poor men, by
the necessary action of such inequality, have been all
these years the slaves of the sons of that rich man.

<!-- page 321 -->

<p>"But suppose, after the death of the rich man, it
could have been shown that there was a son living
by a former marriage, and that he had never legally
married the mother of those five sons; then the
hundred thousand would have gone to the one son,
the one that the law recognized as legitimate, and
the others would have had nothing. Does not the
value of legal marriage rest upon the property basis?
Does not each sustain and perpetuate the other?"</p>

<p>"Do not the poor value legal marriage, make it a
standard of honor, or the lack of it dishonor, as well
as the rich?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They do, Mrs. Berrian; but even here the rich
make the standard, and the poor obey it; and, as in
other cases, they make the standard in their own
interest."</p>

<p>"I do no not see how you can make that appear,"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Which is it, Mr. Berrian, that stands by the
illegitimate child,&mdash;the father, or the mother? We
all know which; but why is it? Public sentiment
curses the mother who will neglect her child,
but public sentiment does not thus condemn the
father who does not support his illegal child; and,
beside, the mother's love is by nature stronger than
that of the father's. He is held more by the external
pressure than by the internal love. Rich men
know this; and they throw their influence in favor
of legal marriage and the public sentiment that
makes each man support his own, thus perpetuating
the property basis for legal marriage.</p>

<p>"The poor man's inheritance, his property, is his

<!-- page 322 -->

bone and muscle, his strength and skill as a laborer;
and these are pledged, become the basis of legal
marriage."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Mr. Rockman, that you are getting
into deep water. If it is as you say, what would
the poor man find to hold him to his labor, if he was
not held to his family by the law and public sentiment?"</p>

<p>"And why should he be held to all the productive
labor, the rich man trading upon and living off the
results of that labor, but producing nothing himself?
There is love enough in the poor man's heart to cause
him to stay by the woman he loves, and to look out
for the happiness of her and her children; it is the
extra load against which he rebels, and he has a
right so to do. The extra load comes from the
double source of legal marriage, and the law of
descent that puts money into the hands of the rich
men's sons, and thus gives them the power to enslave
the sons of the poor."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rockman, are you not morbid upon this
subject? Human nature is imperfect, and has much
to learn as yet; but what is more beautiful than the
family relation? The love of husbands and wives,
brothers and sisters, parents and children, gives us a
glimpse of heaven upon earth."</p>

<p>"It is not the love that I am speaking of, sir, but
the law. Love enforced by law gains no added
charm; and this question of inheritance often causes
children to contend over what the parents have left,
till their love turns to hatred, and they become the
bitterest of enemies."</p>

<!-- page 323 -->

<p>"If, with the present restraints that are thrown
around them, people are so ready to go astray, what
would they be without law to hold them in check?
I can not, for my part, Mr. Rockman, see how your
theory is going to make things any better."</p>

<p>"It is not my theory, Mr. Berrian: I am a student
at the feet of Nature and Nature's God; and, if in
my researches I discover that certain causes produce
certain results, the discovery is mine, but not the law
discovered; the truth that I have gathered from
Nature's pages belongs to humanity. I have discovered
for myself at least, I do not say that others
have not seen this before me; but I find, upon investigation
of the principles involved, that legal
marriage and the law of inheritance as it exists in
society to-day stand directly in the way of the fulfillment
of the request that the will of the Father shall
be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p>

<p>"They can not continue to exist, these two inventions
of man's device, and we become as the angels in
heaven; the first must be swept away before the
last can take place. The conclusion is as inevitable
as that two and two make four; and you and I, sir,
had as well look this truth in the face first as last.
Every time that you pray that the will of the Father
may be done on earth as it is in heaven, you ask
that love may take the place of, may supersede, law;
you ask that the law of hereditary descent may be
abolished in the narrow sense that it now exists, and
that the State, the nation, the world, may become one
great family.</p>

<p>"Every time that you pray for the incoming of

<!-- page 324 -->

Christ's kingdom, you ask for an entire change in
the present order of society. Christians do this
everywhere; and yet when God sends disturbers
of the peace of society, when he sends those who
refuse to obey that which it is their work to unsettle,
to destroy, then comes the wormwood and the gall,
the nails and the thorns. Well could Jesus say to
you all as he did to the two disciples who desired to
sit on his right hand and on his left,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Ye know not what you ask.' "</p>

<p>"And I feel like saying, as the disciples did when
Jesus declared it to be 'easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven,'&mdash;who then can be
saved?"</p>

<p>I had never seen so serious, so troubled a look
upon Arthur's face as when he said this; there
seemed a shrinking, a holding of the breath, as it
were, as he contemplated the possibility of the truth
of the ideas advanced by Rockman. It was as
though one were walking in a straight, smooth path,
and a chasm had suddenly yawned beneath his feet.
I pitied him; for I knew that he would follow where
truth led, and I knew also to what a terrible ordeal
the acceptance of such ideas would subject him. I
thought not of myself, but only of him; for, wherever
he went, whatever he might be called upon to
sacrifice, my place was by his side, and my happiness
to aid and strengthen his hands in whatever his heart
and conscience dictated.</p>

<p>We sat for some moments in silence; but at length
I asked, "Do you recollect, Uncle Rockman, when

<!-- page 325 -->

we were speaking of Minnie's work, and you said
that she was benefiting only herself?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I do, madam," he replied.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me in what particular sense
she was benefiting herself?"</p>

<p>"In the same sense that anyone benefits themselves
when they are learning lessons of use. The Lord
of hosts is preparing his instruments for the final
battle between truth and error, for the great battle
of Gog and Magog; and he selects those instruments
from among all classes. This army of the Lord is
to march in solid phalanx against all the strongholds
of error; but, to do this successfully, the leaders must
be of those who have had experience in, have been
subject to, these very conditions.</p>

<p>"Our government has its military schools, where
young men are educated in the tactics of war; and,
when occasion requires, these schools furnish the
leaders for the nation's army. God sends those who
are to be the leaders in his work to school also: he
takes both men and women, and he sends some to
brothels, some to saloons, some to theological schools
of learning, some to schools of science and philosophy;
some toil with the slave under the lash of the
master, and some go before the mast on the high
seas; some delve in the mine beside the toiling sons
of hardship, and some spend years at the factory's
loom; some beg in the streets, and some fill a felon's
cell.</p>

<p>"To every class, every condition, the voice of
prophecy saith, 'From among your brethren shall
the Lord raise up one to whom you shall listen and

<!-- page 326 -->

find deliverance;' and when the day of fierce conflict
comes, those who have been thus schooled will take
their respective places as officers, leaders, and those
who have been the lowest down may hold the most
responsible positions. Rahab the harlot is then
counted as is Abraham the faithful, among the
worthies. Minnie is preparing for such a position,
and so is friend Berrian here. He obeys the legal
while remaining in school, has accepted the woman
that God gave him from the hands of the law; and
she is now conforming to society's demands, recognizing
the law of the State, which says that she shall
not live with a man without its sanction; but, when
the trumpet sounds that calls to action, then both
will arise and cast aside these bonds, will stand forth
in the liberty wherewith God had made them free.
And the one that can wield the heaviest sword, can
do the greatest execution among the hosts of the
enemy, can deal the surest blows upon the walls of
error's strongholds, such, be it man or woman, and
coming from the brothel or the pulpit, will take the
lead, will wear the insignia of command."</p>

<p>"Do you really look for such a change as will do
away with legal marriage, and the law that gives to
children the property belonging to parents, Mr.
Rockman?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in the bible, Mr. Berrian? do you
believe that God answers prayer? do you believe
that the will of the Father will ever be done on
earth, as it is in heaven? do you believe that we can
have a new earth, a renewed, redeemed one in which
we can be as the angels? do you believe that all this

<!-- page 327 -->

can be realized? and, if so, can the present order of
things, the present human laws, remain in force?"</p>

<p>"I know, Mr. Rockman, that they can not," was
the firm reply; and yet it was given in a tone that
indicated a soul-shiver at the possible results of such
an admission.</p>

<p>"Then, my friend, it only remains to learn how
this change is to be brought about, and also, if you
and I are to blow the rams' horns that are to demolish
the walls of this city of destruction, ere the new
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
can take its place; or, if we are to remain by the
stuff, and let others do this work."</p>

<p>"I shall have to be alone with my own soul and
my God, shall have time to look at this question
on all sides, before I shall know where my path
leads," said Arthur; and, taking the Bible from the
shelf, he proceeded to lead the evening devotions.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">THE VALLEY OF DECISION.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"Choose ye this day whom ye will serve: if the Lord be God,
serve him; if Baal, serve him."&mdash;BIBLE.</p>

<p>THE months sped by, till they lengthened
into years; and Minnie Morris was a
welcome guest in homes from the doors
of which she would once have been
spurned; but the work that she had
once been so active in lagged upon her hands. Of
the band of sisters who had pledged themselves on
that memorable night, not one had failed; but, of
those in other places who had been gathered from
the haunts of vice, some had returned thereto, some
gone to points far West, and married; and the most
of the others had scattered she knew not where.</p>

<p>"Why had she grown weary in well doing?" do
you ask? She had not; but she had learned that
efforts directed toward saving a particular class,
while there was no change in the general structure,
were thrown away. She had learned that there was
a power at work that would not so permit of the readjustment
of imperfect conditions as to render them
desirable or permanent; and she wearied of wasting
her efforts.</p>

<p>She had tested her power to face the world, and
obtain justice so far as she could make them see

<!-- page 329 -->

what justice meant, but she felt that there was a
mightier work still to be done, and one in which she
could not hope for the approval of society. She had
visited us, and we had discussed these things by the
hour. Slowly but surely the conviction was forcing
itself upon us, that the time was coming when we
should be called upon to decide for or against the
opinions that were gaining ground among the thinkers;
but we waited the hour, bided our time.</p>

<p>It came at length to Minnie. Mary Bliss, the one
of the five who had spoken so defiantly when they
gave the history of what had made them outcasts,
had a lover from whom she refused to be separated,
and she would not marry him legally. "I love him,
and he loves me; and that is enough," she said.</p>

<p>"But, if you love each other, why object to marriage?"
it was urged by those who desired most sincerely
that nothing should occur to mar "the good
work that had been done." For, betwixt you and
me, dear reader, after Minnie, aided by Arthur's sermon
that came in so opportunely, had fought the
battle and won the victory for herself and those who
stood with her, the good sisters of the church were
never weary of pointing to her as an evidence of
what might be done, "if people would only have
charity for those who tried to reform."</p>

<p>These were anxious that Mary should do just the
right thing; but to all their urging she would only
reply, "If I can not hold a man without the law to
help me, I do not want him."</p>

<p>"But it is wrong, Mary: God commands marriage."</p>

<p>"I can find no other command than that the man

<!-- page 330 -->

should cleave unto his wife, which he will be sure to do
if he loves her, and if he does not there can be no such
marriage as God sanctions; and, more than this, I am
pledged to these my sisters, and I will not take bonds
upon myself that will give another power over me."</p>

<p>"But you will ruin them, or force them to reject
you" was urged still further.</p>

<p>"They will not reject me for being true to myself,
to my ideas of right; they are not a set of Pharisees;
and, if others forsake them, the fault will be with
those who dare to sit in judgment upon their acts.
Were the Jesus whom you pretend to worship here,
he would not condemn me."</p>

<p>"But his command was, 'Go, and sin no more.' "</p>

<p>"I am not sinning; love is the fulfilling of the
law: so your Bible says. But you do not believe it:
if you did you would leave me in peace. God made
me as I am, and he will take care of me; and it is not
your business what I do, so long as I do not intrude
myself upon you."</p>

<p>They finally gave her up, and demanded that
Minnie should do the same. "If you permit her to
remain with you, you sanction her course, and are as
bad as she is," so they said.</p>

<p>But Minnie had carried the day once, and brought
the public to her terms, and she did not intend to be
dictated to now; so she steadily refused their demands,
and for reward was ostracised by the entire
community. The past was all brought up anew; those
who had been her warm friends declared that they
knew how it would be, that they did not believe that
any of them had been any better than they should

<!-- page 331 -->

be all this time, that there was no knowing how
much crime had been carried on underhandedly, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Finally the excitement ran so high that a mob was
raised; the house in which Minnie and Mary resided
was demolished, and the inmates were driven into
the streets, while the others were threatened. Minnie
made no appeal to the law against this outrage, but,
collecting the girls all together, they held another
midnight convocation; and, with the momentary
expectation of being intruded upon and driven out,
they renewed their pledges to stand by each other.</p>

<p>The lover of Mary Bliss, and Eben Rockman, were
both with them; and there, with the calm stars shining
down upon them, they listened for one hour to Rockman
as he quoted Bible, and pointed to the coming
conflict between that which existed now and the
better order of society which must take its place; and
they wrote out a new declaration of independence,
those twenty, for Rose had gone to them as soon as
the storm commenced.</p>

<p>There, in the midnight hour, those twenty women
wrote out their declaration of independence; in
which they asserted their right to their own persons,
subject only to the law of love, repudiating the
usurped authority of both Church and State, and
vowing that they would never delegate that right to
any man. To this declaration they pledged all the
powers of their being, time, talents, money, strength
of body and soul, and life itself, if need be; and then
sent forth that declaration to the great public.</p>

<p>"We will test this matter to the utmost," they
said; "we will take Freedom, Love, and Truth as our

<!-- page 332 -->

watchwords; the law that God has written upon the
tablet of our hearts, as our guide; and we will wage an
eternal war upon all institutions that place the keeping
of woman's person in the hand of man, and that
make men and women of less account than money.</p>

<p>"We take this position, make the declaration, because
we sincerely believe that we have a right to do
so under the declaration that all have the right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; we also
believe that the law of the land has no right to interfere
with this our religious conviction of the sacredness
of our own persons, and the sacrilege of any
attempt to take from us the right of their control.</p>

<p>"We have counted the cost; we have come to this
decision slowly, and, through years of bitter experience;
and come life, come death, come then what
will, we intend to abide by it."</p>

<p>The effect of this declaration upon the community
seemed to confound by its very boldness, and people
stood as if in amaze; and, in their confusion as to
what was best to be done, they did nothing. The
idea, that a woman should dare to assert that she
belonged to herself, was so tremendous that it took
away their breath.</p>

<p>Rockman and Rose put on their old disguises, and
passed around among the people till they became
satisfied that no further violence was intended, for
the time at least; and then Rose returned to me,
bringing a report of what had been done, and copies
of their declaration. We said nothing; but the
news reached B&mdash;&mdash;, and the church over which
Arthur was pastor; and then those who had been

<!-- page 333 -->

overruled, but were not satisfied with his marriage
and the course he had then pursued, demanded from
him a decided condemnation of the course taken by
Minnie and her friends, or his resignation.</p>

<p>"I must think of this a while first, friends," he
said in reply. "There are many things that were
once accounted as crimes, that are now considered
virtues; and I can not decide hastily. The Scriptures
declare that God will turn and overturn, till he
shall come whose right is to reign; and how do I
know but this is one of his methods of overturning?
If this thing is not of God, it will come to nought
without my frown; and otherwise we can not put it
down. Permit me to let it alone, for a time at least,
lest haply I be found fighting against God."</p>

<p>But this they would not listen to; when there was
evidence of repentance and a better life, it was his
Christian duty to exercise charity toward them; but
now, when they had come out so boldly in their
wickedness, were defying God and man, having defended
them then, it was his duty to denounce them
now, or his silence would be construed into approval.</p>

<p>This aroused the old fire within him, and he coolly
replied, "I shall not speak till I choose; no one has
a right to lord it over my conscience. The question
lies between me and my God, and, when it is decided
there, I will tell you; not before."</p>

<p>This did not content them; and they declared the
pulpit vacant till his decision was brought in.</p>

<p>"And your pulpit would stand for ever vacant, so
far as I am concerned, if I recognized no higher authority
than yours," he replied; "but truth demands

<!-- page 334 -->

my open allegiance; and when my decision is made,
when I have had time to look at this matter till I
can separate truth and error, time to analyze the
causes which have led to this result,&mdash;then you shall
hear from me: I think I can do this in one month."</p>

<p>To this they finally consented, and even went so
far as to retract their previous decision, and ask him
to fill the desk till then. Such is the power of a soul
that, strong in conscious rectitude, refuses to bow
to the arbitrary demands of ignorance or prejudice.</p>

<p>My pride had taken umbrage at their treatment,
and I did not wish him to accept their offer; but
his reply was, "No, dear wife: if my decision is
such as I think it must be, we have such a battle to
fight, that we can not afford to indulge in mere personal
feelings.</p>

<p class="small">'We must stay in the beautiful valley<br/>

Where love crowns the meek and the lowly,'&mdash;</p>

<p>Even in the valley of humility,&mdash;if we would gather
the strength that we shall need."</p>

<p>"But the poet says that,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'This low vale is far from contention,<br/>

Where no soul can dream of dissension,' "&mdash;</p>

<p>I replied.</p>

<p>"We will carry the vale in our hearts, then; and
the dews that descend from the mountains of power
shall refresh and prepare us for whatever we are
called to pass through," was his gentle answer.</p>

<p>"That does not sound much like the defiance you
gave the church, my dear," I said.</p>

<!-- page 335 -->

<p>"Well, wife, I am only human, and liable to err;
but, had the church assailed no rights but those of
Arthur Berrian, I hardly think I should have been
so unyielding. I fight for truth, freedom, humanity:
when these are assailed, I have no right to yield."</p>

<p>The next month was a trying one; I watched and
waited with an anxiety beyond any thing that I had
ever felt before. Arthur spent much of his time
alone; and I knew that he was wrestling with himself,
striving for the firmness, the calmness, that an
abiding faith in the truth can alone give; so that, if
truth led him into the valley of the shadow of death
to his previous ideas of right, he could walk fearlessly
wherever she indicated.</p>

<p>"Wife," said he to me one day as the month of probation
drew toward its close, "it is easy to talk of
renouncing all for Christ's sake,&mdash;to talk of declaring
the truth you see, when you know that all men will
forsake you and flee, but it is no light thing to be
counted as vile when your motives are pure, and to
be meek and patient under undeserved reproach."</p>

<p>I looked at him with a smile, though my own heart
sank within me; for I knew then as well as I do now
what his decision would be.</p>

<p>When the month expired he went with firm step
but pale face into the desk that he knew he should
never ascend again. The hymn that he announced
was,&mdash;</p>


<p class="small">"Jesus, I my cross have taken,<br/>

All to leave and follow thee;<br/>

Naked, poor, despised, forsaken,<br/>

Thou from hence my all shalt be."</p>

<!-- page 336 -->

<p>And then such a petition! it seemed like that of a
mother who commends her children to God when
about to leave them for ever; closing with the Lord's
Prayer, and emphasizing the words, "Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven;" then, taking for his text
the declaration of Jesus, "In that world they neither
marry nor are given in marriage," he preached from
it a discourse that it seemed to me ought to have
convinced the most obstinate; closing with the declaration
that he believed love to be the fulfilling of the
law, and that Minnie Morris had been disciplined to
do a work that would eventually place her name
among those who should be accounted worthy of
honor by coming generations.</p>

<p>His earnestness, the deep feeling manifested, won
for him the sympathy of many of his audience; but
they regarded his position as erroneous, dangerous
even, and they dare not sustain him.</p>

<p>And thus at length they stood, Arthur Berrian
the minister, side by side with Minnie Morris the so-called
harlot; he with the woman who loved him,
and she with her score of sisters, each bearing aloft
the flag of woman's full emancipation, and each feeling,
that, with truth to sustain, they, like Elijah of
old, were individually stronger than the four hundred
prophets of the Baal of error.</p>

<p>As for Eben Rockman, he seemed to grow young
