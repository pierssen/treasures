<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> of the following chapters have already
appeared in print. Two of the incidents contained 
in them have been dramatized; one on the
French, and the other on the English stage.</p>

<p>This circumstance, which has been noticed
by one of the ablest and most impartial of our
periodicals (the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>), has arisen from the
fact of the Editor's having, in society, frequently
described the events which actually occurred
many years since. He does not, however, think
this a sufficient reason for omitting them in his
bundle of gleanings from the late lamented Mr.
Gurney's papers, in which they stand <i>originally</i>
recorded.</p>

<h2>GILBERT GURNEY.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I resolved upon committing to paper
sundry passages of my life, I determined most
carefully to abstain from the perpetration of a
piece of <i>autobiography</i>&mdash;not because the public
has been somewhat surfeited with that kind of
literature; since, if I have my will, <i>my</i> memoranda 
of the scenes and circumstances which I
have witnessed, and which have occurred to me,
will never meet the public eye&mdash;but because, for
the most part, "Reminiscences," and "Lives
and Times," and the like, are extremely tiresome 
to read, seeing that the matters and events

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

incidents and occurrences, which are, or were at
the time at which they were set down, all of
great importance to the recording individual,
have (as all those books savour sadly of senility)
lost all interest for the reader, long before they
reach his eye.</p>

<p>Nevertheless and notwithstanding, such is the
force of habit, and such the dominion of principle, 
that, for the life of me, I cannot prevail
upon myself to leave my notes huddled together
without something like arrangement, nor without
just so much notice of myself and my family as
may serve to account for my curious wanderings
over the face of the earth, and for many of the
transactions in which I have been doomed to
bear a principal part.</p>

<p>Begin we, therefore, with the beginning. "A
fig for your dates," says the Smyrna man to the
Tunisian. Nevertheless, in this place, dates
are really essential, as marking the progress of
the writer through his chequered career. Be
patient, reader, whomsoever thou mayst chance
to be, and I will be brief.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

<p>I was born in the same year, and in the same
month of the same year, as Lord Byron&mdash;but
eight days later&mdash;on the 30th of January&mdash;a
memorable day, too. I always felt a sort of
sympathetic self-satisfaction as Byron advanced
in age and reputation, in the recollection that&mdash;although, 
with my inherent respect for his rank
and talents, I could not possibly take the liberty
of coming into the world before him&mdash;I began
my life so nearly about the same period.</p>

<p>There was, nevertheless, something very disheartening 
to me in the sombre seriousness of
my <i>jour de f&ecirc;te</i>. I would rather have been born
on the anniversary of a victory or a coronation.
Let me be ever so good a boy, I could enjoy no
holiday on my birth-day&mdash;never could be taken
to a play&mdash;seeing that the theatres were all
closed; and moreover, and above this, I lost
twelve thousand pounds which my godfather,
the late Sir Charles Smith, <i>would have left me</i>,
if I had been christened after him, as he had
proposed, and my parents had intended: but,
happening to be born upon the anniversary of

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

the martyrdom of our too conceding king, my
sire, somewhat superstitious, would not hear of
my bearing the same name as the unfortunate
monarch;&mdash;so I was christened Gilbert, and lost
my legacy, Sir Charles having taken huff at my
not being named after him, as our old friend
Pepys did at Mrs. Brown's, where he and Sir
William Penn were godfathers, and Mrs. Jordan
and Shipman godmothers to her boy&mdash;<i>that</i> being
the king's birth-day, upon which Pepys rose
early and put six spoons and a silver porringer
<i>into his pocket to give away;</i> but in the sequel 
did give the midwife ten shillings, and the
nurse five shillings, and the maid of the house
two shillings;&mdash;"yet forasmuch as he expected
to give his name to the child, but did not (it
being called John), he forbore, then, to give
his plate." Thus, by similar mishaps, did <i>Gilbert</i> 
Gurney lose twelve thousand pounds, and
<i>John</i> Browne a porringer and six spoons.</p>

<p>The saying goes that it is "a wise child
who knows his own father." For myself it is
a disparagement neither to my own personal

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

wisdom nor to my mother's unquestionable character, 
to admit that I knew very little of mine.
A faint vision of a large red face, a white
head, a black tail, and a brown walking-stick,
floats in my mind, the possessor of which I was
taught in infancy to respect as my parent. He
died, however, before I was three years old, in
the house in which he had lived for upwards of
twenty years, and in which I was born; it stood
in Bolsover-street, Cavendish-square,&mdash;a street
which no longer exists, thanks to the extraordinary 
improvements which have taken place in
that part of the metropolis; it having, several
years since, subsided into a chaos of old materials, 
whence has arisen one of the most magnificent 
promenades in Europe. Like the Dragon's
teeth, the buried bricks of former houses have
given birth to a legion of palaces.</p>

<p>I remember our particular house perfectly;
the front parlour had two windows looking to
the street, over the blinds of which I recollect
my father had a strange propensity for looking
out at the passengers; and so earnestly did he

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

indulge in the pursuit (if standing still, may be
so called), that in its enjoyment he would remain
intently watching the most trifling occurrence
which came under his observation, with his nose
flattened against the pane, as little aware of the
circumstance as the anxious hero who stuck his
spear through his foot without knowing it, while
leaning his chin on the reversed end of it watching 
the fate of a battle. I remember, too, that
opposite to the windows, one of which, that
nearest the fire-place, was the solace of my
parent's leisure, there was a recess in which
stood a sideboard, perpetually decorated with
cruets, beakers, and glasses, and three mahogany
cases, two for smart-handled knives, and one in
the centre for spoons, over which sideboard was
affixed to the panel (for the room was wainscotted), 
a round mirror, encircled with gilt boluses, 
supporting two branches for candles; and
over the mantel-piece hung a portrait of my
father himself, when a smart young man, by
an artist of the name of Abbot, who obtained a
reputation for painting Lord Nelson more than

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

once, and who, I recollect, lost his life by swallowing 
as a draught, a mixture sent him from
an apothecary to be used as a gargle.</p>

<p>The drawing-room had three windows in it;
over the fire-place there hung a picture of my
mother, by Wheatley, and in one panel at the
side was a portrait of my sister Jane, who died
before I was born; and in the other a likeness of
my brother Cuthbert, who was seventeen years
my senior, and in India at the time of which I
now speak.</p>

<p>My grandfather I never saw; he was a physician 
in the West of England, or rather, as I
suspect, an apothecary, &amp;c., for I never could
find his name in any old list of the college. He
set my father to study the law, who, being deficient 
either in talent or industry, soon found, to
use a colloquial phrase in a double sense that
"he could make nothing of it;" he, therefore,
abandoned it as a profession, and marrying soon
afterwards, the old gentleman contributed liberally 
during his lifetime to support the establishment 
of the young couple, and at his death

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

bequeathed them a fortune perfectly adequate
to all their wants and wishes.</p>

<p>My mother's maiden name was Gataker, and
my father, who has been represented to me as a
proud man, was very vain of the connexion.
The earliest of her ancestors married a Miss
Jocosa Burley; but the one from which, it
seemed, she claimed to descend, was a clergyman 
who had been married four times. Certain
it is that I have at this moment a seal of my
father's arms impaled with those of his wife;
and there I find the lion rampant per fess, sable
and gules, and the cross pattee fleury with blue
tips.</p>

<p>My father never was known so seriously and
suddenly to lose his temper as when he was
thought to be descended from the Norfolk
Gurneys (not that a more honourable or respectable 
family exists; and quite sure am I that
a monarch might be proud of a connexion with
one of its members, whose noble heart and charitable 
disposition would do honour to a throne);
because he fancied his to be an elder branch

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

of the house, and that he sprang from the De
Gourneys, while they were yet resident at Le
Brai, before the conquest; and so satisfied of this
fact was he, that nothing but a request from my
mother to the contrary prevented his christening,
or rather naming, my eldest brother Cuthbert,
Eudes, after his pet ancestor, who assumed the
name of Gournay, when Rollo, at the division of
Neustria, amongst his adherents, bestowed upon
him the fortress so called.</p>

<p>All this was a question of time and history,
but hence arose his firm conviction that, instead
of the junior, it was the elder branch of the
family that settled in Somersetshire, and that the
Gurneys of Barew Gurney and Inglishcombe,
with all the accumulation of the Harpetree
property, had of right the precedence of the
Gurneys of Keswick.</p>

<p>Of the plain blue cross on his shield my father
was justly proud; and his gurnet capsized upon
his chapeau gules, was to him a point of no little
importance; and having not only great respect
for his memory, but strong faith in his accuracy,

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

I have continued to use the same arms and crest
even up to the present moment, without doubt,
hesitation, or disturbance of mind.</p>

<p>I pass over the first sixteen or seventeen
years of my career at a dash&mdash;<i>per saltum</i>. My
school life was not a happy one. I was idle and
careless of my tasks&mdash;I had no aptitude for
learning languages&mdash;I hated Greek, and absolutely 
shuddered at Hebrew&mdash;I fancied myself
a genius, and any thing that could be done in
a hurry and with little trouble, I did tolerably
well&mdash;but application I had not; and when
my excellent mother (who survived her husband
eighteen years) suggested to me, on the advice
of Mr. Graham, a most worthy man and excellent 
magistrate, to enter myself of Lincoln's-inn
and commence the study of the law, I could not
help calling to her mind the history she had
herself told me of my father's signal defeat in
the same pursuit.</p>

<p>There is something extremely vague in the
term studying for the bar&mdash;in seven cases out of
ten it means doing nothing, under a gentlemanly

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

pretence; in mine nothing could be more unlike
what it professed to be; I paid my entrance-money, 
gave my caution, and thenceforth proceeded 
to "mine Inn" for four or five days in
each term, threw on my gown, walked into hall,
and dreading the fatigue of even eating professionally, 
wrote down my name and walked
out again.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, to satisfy my
kind and anxious mother, who, with something
more like certainty than ever I considered justifiable 
by appearances, anticipated my elevation
to either the Woolsack or the King's Bench&mdash;the 
latter by far the more probable&mdash;that I
should put myself under somebody who might
do me the favour of permitting me to copy his
papers <i>gratis</i>, while he did her the kindness of
taking three hundred pounds <i>per annum</i> out of
her pocket in return for his good nature: and
accordingly I was harnessed under the inspection
and direction of the worthy magistrate whose
name I have already mentioned, and confided
to the care of a very learned gentleman of the

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

profession, who, at the time of my writing this,
is filling a situation not very far below one of
those which my too fond parent, in the ardour of
her affection, had destined for my occupation.
What might have been the result of my serious
application to the dry drudgery of this learned
man's office it is impossible for me to surmise.
It so happened that the experiment was destined
never to be tried, for, among my fellow-pupils
at his chambers, there was one whose society
and conversation I found so much more agreeable 
than the elaborated tautology over which I
had to pore from ten o'clock in the morning till
ten at night&mdash;dinner alone intervening&mdash;that I
gradually relaxed from a regular attendance
upon my work, first, to a gentle indifference,
and then to an absolute aversion and distaste for
the whole pursuit.</p>

<p>My young companion was a bit of a poet, a
bit of an artist, a bit of a musician, and above
all,&mdash;to me at the period delightful,&mdash;a bit of an
actor. He knew several of the regular actors&mdash;they 
visited at his father's house&mdash;I was invited

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

by my young friend, and met Charles Kemble
and Mathews. The latter at that period was
new to London&mdash;his merits were not yet appreciated&mdash;he 
wanted that nerve and confidence
which subsequent patronage and ultimate success 
inspired. I well remember the evening.
Charles Kemble was grave and gentlemanly;
but Mathews, although quite gentlemanly
enough for all earthly purposes, was gay as a
lark. He gave us imitations and personifications. 
There, yet unseen by metropolitan eyes,
his old Frenchman, his old Scotswoman, all the
bright and vivid pictures, now grown familiar to
the public, were exhibited to us fresh in all
the charms of novelty.</p>

<p>That night decided me as to Lincoln's Inn&mdash;not 
that I intended to mount the stage myself,
but after seeing that exquisite mimic, the best
actor off the stage that ever lived, I resolved
to put into execution a design which I had
previously imparted to my young friend&mdash;a
design no other than that of writing a farce for
one of the theatres.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

<p>The moment this notable scheme took possession 
of what I fancied my brain, law was at
an end; I had no patience with the parchments.
As that witty (now veteran) George Colman
the younger says in his "Reckoning with
Time,"&mdash;which, by the by, he wrote when he
was five and forty, and fancied himself old,&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"&mdash;&mdash;Congreve beat Blackstone hollow,
And in <i>my</i> crown no pleas had Hale
        To supersede Apollo."</p>

</div>

<p>It is quite clear that when a man takes what
is called a fancy, the one pursuit is paramount.
A geologist will tell you that there is nothing
in the world so interesting, so engrossing, so
captivating, as perambulating a dull and miserable 
country, chipping off bits of rock, and
scooping out lumps of clay. He sees no beauty
in Richmond Hill&mdash;his only delight is in discovering 
and telling you of what it is composed.
The finest mountain in the world has no charm
for his eye in the mass. No; to be agreeable
to <i>him</i>, he must go and knock a little bit of
it off, and wrap up that little bit of dirt in a

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

little bit of paper, and carry it to Somerset-house, 
and then take another little bit of
paper, and write a history of it.</p>

<p>To ordinary folks nothing can be much more
dull than such a course of proceeding; to the
geologist it is delight&mdash;upon me the particular
taste for dramatic-writing had a similar effect:
Act 1. Scene 1.&mdash;"Enter Sir Jeremy Bootjack;"
delightful thought!&mdash;there I saw him dressed
as nobody ever was dressed in his life&mdash;he, the
said Sir Jeremy, appearing in a sort of mongrel
full dress with jockey tops and a pig-tail: whilst
all the lovers and their ladies were to be flirting
and tom-fooling about in the costume of the
then present day. But what was all that to me?
Munden and Dowton, and all those men, wore
court suits, and jack boots, and cocked hats, and
pigtails; and I was sure it was right, and so
to work I went; bought three or four French
vaudevilles (which, it being then war-time,
were not quite so easy of access as they became
after the Duke of Wellington had set Europe
to rest and raised England to the pinnacle of

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

glory, whence smaller people than his Grace
have been every day dragging her down), and,
filching an incident from each, made up my
very effective drama.</p>

<p>Young as I was at that time, and inexperienced 
in such matters, a little observation assured
me that the English audiences, who are, in point
of fact, as undramatic in their notions as Methodists, 
would not be satisfied with a <i>single</i> incident, 
which, on the foreign stage, amply serves
to amuse and delight. The French go to a play
prepared to view the affair theatrically, and are
ready to catch the slightest allusion, and enter
into the spirit of the author&mdash;with the English
it is necessary to thump in your meaning, to
make every effect clear "to the meanest comprehension," 
or else you fail; and as to incidents, 
there must be a dozen in a farce, one
after the other, if you mean that people should
laugh or be pleased. This being clearly the
case, I set to work, and, as I have just said,
crammed the materials of some four or five
light French pieces into my maiden drama (as

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

an Indian cook sticks kabobs upon a skewer),
and was, when I had finished it, convinced that
I had at least equalled Foote, emulating therein
the exultation which a dramatist of our own day
expressed at having given "Billy the go by"&mdash;Billy 
meaning Shakspeare!&mdash;I recollect so well
the anxiety with which I copied out my MS.,
the infinite pains I took to dash and underline
the points which I felt quite confident would
set the house in a roar, and the nervous solicitude 
with which I read my first effort to my
young friend, who had promised when it was
finished to present it to the manager.</p>

<p>My exemplary mother, who had a sort of
instinctive horror of actors and actresses, was not
slow to find out the enormity&mdash;as she thought
it&mdash;of which I had been guilty. Something
fell from my young friend during a visit which
we were paying her, which developed the important 
secret&mdash;for such I intended it to be;
and the result of the discovery was the following
letter. Upon recording which, it may be as
well to observe that my surviving parent had

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

shortly after my admission into Lincoln's-inn,
given up her house in Bolsover-street, and retired 
to the neighbourhood of Teddington, leaving 
me in possession of some ready-furnished
lodgings in Great Suffolk-street, Haymarket.</p>

<p>But for the letter&mdash;here it is:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="right">"<i>Teddington, May</i> 8, 18&mdash;.</p>

<p>"My dearest Gilbert,&mdash;I take up my pen
with regret to address you upon a subject to
which I once before slightly alluded, and upon
which I am quite aware our opinions are at
variance.</p>

<p>"I think I may assure myself of your readiness 
to give me credit for an anxious desire for
your happiness as well as your respectability,
and for having no wish either to curtail the
enjoyments which your income justifies, or to
restrain the amusements which are congenial to
your age and inclinations; but there <i>is</i> one point
upon which I feel it my duty to speak out,&mdash;to 
warn you of dangers by which what appears
a most innocent pursuit is environed, and to

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

endeavour, if possible, to check you in a career
which I know you are on the point of beginning,
or, perhaps, have actually begun&mdash;I mean
that of a dramatic author.</p>

<p>"I dare say you will laugh at me for my
apprehensions, and even ridicule the partiality
which, in the midst of my fears, magnifies my son
into a 'dramatic author,' because, as I happen
to know, he has written a farce. Everything
has a beginning; and if this farce be produced
and succeeds, it will only be the first of a
lengthened race; if it fail, you will be exposed
to the ridicule of the newspapers and the green-room. 
Why adopt such an alternative?</p>

<p>"Now, understand me, my dear Gilbert. Do
not imagine that I feel any of those blind and
determined prejudices against actors and actresses 
which you have, more than once, half
playfully and half in earnest, accused me of
maintaining. I have no doubt that they may
be extremely worthy persons in their way.
What I contend for is, that while pursuing your
studies for a serious avocation, in which no success 

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

can be hoped for, without sedulous attention, 
it will be ruinous to associate with a class
of men and women whose whole existence is
one tissue of artificiality; who see nature not in
her proper colours, but through the darkened
medium of theatrical lamp-light, and who, from
the constant mechanical repetition of exalted
sentiments, the personification of conflicting
passions, and the assumption of a diversity of
characters, are rendered callous to the realities
of life,&mdash;except when they may personally affect
their own interests,&mdash;and are imbued with a contempt 
for those principles and qualities which
they habitually treat as mere matters of acting.</p>

<p>"It is curious to observe, although the effect
may be extremely natural, how the force of habit
weakens the value and importance of the most
serious objects in our existence. How different
are the feelings of the man who administers an
oath to a witness in a court of justice from those
of the individual to whom it is tended! The
undertaker's man at a funeral, if he be serious
at all, is sad only in the way of business. No

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

ceremony of that nature or character could be
made either solemn or affecting to him. The
butcher never could be brought to pity the
struggles of a dying lamb. The dramatic performer, 
in the same way, talks of honour, and
virtue, and the best affections of the heart, like
a parrot; and although, here and there, there
may be one whose taste for literature induces
him to dwell upon some splendid passages of
our great dramatic poets, he speaks and thinks
even of those professionally,&mdash;and considers
them relatively to the 'effect' they will produce 
in the delivery, and not with reference to
the principles they inculcate or the virtues they
applaud.</p>

<p>"But it is not with the individuals I quarrel;
nor is it just that a universal censure should be
applied to a community in which there are, no
doubt, many exceptions to the general rule. It
is to the art, or calling, and to the pursuits connected 
with it, I object, as affecting the study of
the law. I hate lecturing, and, indeed, am not
well qualified for it; but experience convinces

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

me that the avocations of the lawyer and the
dramatist are incompatible. You need not tell
me that there are many attractions in the prospect 
of success as a dramatist, which, to a very
young man, are in a high degree alluring&mdash;the
facility which it affords to an introduction to the
gay and lively,&mdash;the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the playhouses,&mdash;the 
society of wits,&mdash;the association with talent
and beauty. But ask yourself, my dear child,
whether these enticements are to be admitted or
rejected. Look round, and see whether any
instance exists of high professional success in
any other pursuit, where the equivocal avocation
of play-writing has been adopted."</p>

<br/>

<p>I recollect perfectly well throwing down my
mother's letter when I came to this passage,
absolutely indignant at the supposition of the
incompatibility of my two pursuits. But when
I came to the examination of facts, I found
myself unable to make out a case. Sheridan
was my strong hold: but that failed me; for
although his genius placed him in the first ranks
of society (and he was then yet in full strength

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

and vigour), he had never established himself
in a profession. Murphy was a barrister; but
although he was a good dramatic author, he
never shone at the bar. Our own George
Colman, with talent equal to anything, began
with the law; he became an admirable dramatist, 
but no lawyer.</p>

<p>Then I bethought me of Addison, whose one
great play established him in the highest class of
dramatic authors, but I found myself little better
off; for he, like Sheridan, made no figure in
any learned profession: but having been for
many years avowedly "a man of letters," married 
Lady Warwick, got into Parliament, and
was made Secretary of State. Now, said I, I
have my triumph. I'll quote Addison upon my
exemplary parent. But no: what his biographer
says of him settled that question:&mdash;"In 1717
he rose to his highest elevation, being made
Secretary of State; <i>but it is universally confessed 
that he was unequal to the duties of the
place</i>." This, considering the Secretaries of
State we have since seen flourishing in office,

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

was rather a damper to my ardour in <i>his</i> behalf.
"In the House of Commons he could not speak,
and therefore was useless to the Government.
In the office he could not issue an order without
losing his time in quest of fine expressions.
What he gained in rank he lost in credit, and
finding by experience his own inability, was
forced to solicit his dismission with a pension
of 1500<i>l</i>. a-year. His friends palliated this relinquishment, 
of which both friends and enemies
knew the true reason, with an account of declining 
health, and the necessity of recess and quiet.
<i>He now returned to his vocation, and began to plan
literary occupations for his future life</i>. He prepared 
a <i>tragedy</i> on the death of Socrates,
and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I threw down the book in despair. The
author, incompetent to the fulfilment of high
office in real life, returns from the station to
which he had ascended, and, resuming his vocation, 
prepares a tragedy. This vexed me.</p>

<p>Congreve was my next attempt. He died in
honour and in affluence, and his body lay in

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

State in the Jerusalem Chamber, and the Duke
of Bridgewater, and Lord Godolphin, and Lord
Wilmington, and the Lord knows whom besides,
were pall-bearers. What could my exemplary
parent say to <i>that?</i>&mdash;When I asked the "authorities," 
they answered me, that "Congreve was
sent to school at Kilkenny, and thence to the
University of Dublin, where he acquired a perfect 
skill in all the branches of polite literature;
a little after the revolution in 1688, he was sent
over to London, and placed in the Middle
Temple, but&mdash;"&mdash;What did I see?&mdash;"<i>the law
proving too dry for him, he troubled himself
little with it, and continued to pursue his former
studies</i>." He brought out his "Old Bachelor"
in 1693, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "here is another break-down;
but still his admirable plays have procured for
him an immortal reputation. What signified
the law to him? He must have been as proud
of his place in society as any Lord Chief Justice
in Christendom." There again was I wrong,

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

for Voltaire has recorded of him quite the contrary.</p>

<p>"He raised the glory of comedy," says Voltaire, 
"to a greater height than any English
writer before or since our time&mdash;he wrote only
a few plays, but they were excellent in their
kind&mdash;the laws of the drama are strictly
observed in them." This praise elated and
delighted me: what immediately follows I confess 
surprised me&mdash;"They abound with characters 
which are shadowed <i>with the utmost
delicacy, and we meet with not so much as one
low or coarse jest</i>."</p>

<p>What can more strongly mark the difference
which exists between the manners and conversation 
of Congreve's day and our own? In order
to render Congreve's comedies endurable on the
modern stage, more than one-third of the dialogue 
is now either omitted or greatly modified&mdash;a 
circumstance which gave rise to that witty
observation of Sheridan's, who, after witnessing
the representation of "Love for Love," purified

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

for the refined modern public, said,&mdash;"This is
not Congreve's play&mdash;the popular fastidiousness
has ruined it&mdash;such prunings for propriety's
sake are like the emasculation of animals; you
eradicate their vice, but you destroy their
vigour."</p>

<p>Still, however, I dwelt upon Voltaire's praises.
"He was infirm," says Voltaire, "and come
to the verge of life when I knew him. Mr.
Congreve had one defect, which was his entertaining 
<i>too mean an idea of his profession, that of
a writer</i>."</p>

<p>What, said I, was even Congreve ashamed
of play-writing&mdash;he who (as his French friend
says) owed to it both fame and fortune? This,
thought I, is as bad an answer to my mother
as any of the former ones which I had prepared.</p>

<p>I then bethought me of Massinger, a man
universally esteemed, as I had always heard,&mdash;but 
<i>he</i> served me no better than the others; for
having been entered of St. Alban's Hall, Oxford,

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

he applied his mind to poetry and romance for
four years or more, and not to logic or philosophy, 
as he ought to have done, and for which
alone he was patronized by the Earl of Pembroke. 
He left the University <i>without a degree</i>,
became a play-writer, and died in his house near
the Theatre&mdash;to be sure he was a good play-writer, 
but he was nothing else.</p>

<p>Otway, like Massinger, had, or might have
had, the advantages of an University education&mdash;but 
leaving College <i>without a degree</i>, took to
writing plays for his livelihood&mdash;they were good
plays&mdash;popular plays, and he was a successful
author,&mdash;but he died of starvation, or rather in
the act of hastily satisfying the hunger under
which he had been suffering, through the
charity of a stranger in a Coffee House.&mdash;I
did not think it prudent to let Otway loose upon
my mother, neither could I venture to quote
Farquhar, whose career began under equally
auspicious circumstances, and ended nearly as
ill.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

<p>Rowe, who was the son of a Sergeant-at-Law,
was by his father entered of the Middle Temple
at an early age; and being extremely clever,
could have made himself a highly distinguished
member of the profession&mdash;but&mdash;at twenty-four
he wrote a tragedy, and, although he lived
respectably, and received the honours of a grave
in Poets' Corner, he never made a figure at the
Bar.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson was a bricklayer, and then a
soldier, but the "said Ben" neither built houses
nor reaped laurels. Beaumont was the son of a
judge, and entered of the Inner Temple; but,
says his biographer, "it does not appear <i>that he
made any proficiency in the law</i>, his passion for
the Muses being such as made him devote
himself entirely to the Muses." Foote was educated 
at Oxford, and thence removed to the
Temple, as designed for the law. "The dryness 
and gravity of this study, however, not
suiting the vivacity and volubility of Foote's
spirit, <i>and his fortune, whatever it was, being
dissipated, he took to the stage</i>." I then began

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

to despair; I looked round me, but found no
more justification in the successes of my contemporaries 
than in those of my predecessors, and
accordingly, instead of replying with the pertness 
of self-sufficiency to my mother, upon a
point where, as it seemed to me, she was unassailable, 
I fell to calculating, since there must be
a choice, and since it was clear that the "two
trades could never agree," which was likely to
be the pleasanter and more profitable of the
two.</p>

<p>The result of these deliberations was a resolution 
for the present to temporise&mdash;to finish my
one farce, if I never wrote another, and then to
judge, by its reception and success, whether I
should entirely renounce or decidedly embrace
the craft of play-writing, for which, as every
dunce who spoiled paper thought before me, I
fancied I had a "wonderful talent."</p>

<p>It was to the effect of procrastinating my
final decision upon these points that I wrote
to my excellent mother, imploring her to believe
that I duly appreciated all her care and kindness, 

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

and assuring her, that, let me take what
course I might, she might be perfectly certain
that I should do nothing to disgrace the family
of the Gurneys, or its alliance with that of
Gataker.</p>

<p>I had, however, accidentally placed myself in
a situation full of temptation. I could not obtain
chambers in Lincoln's Inn, which I was anxious
to secure, and, as I have already mentioned,
took a first floor in Suffolk-street, Charing
Cross, then extremely unlike what it afterwards
became, in the course of the improvements in
that neighbourhood. At that period it consisted
for the most part of tailors' houses, the upper
floors of which were tenanted in their different
degrees by gentlemen loose upon town, visitors
to the metropolis, and officers on half-pay, of
which it appeared the greater proportion were
considered to be "frae the North," inasmuch
as Suffolk-street was nicknamed in that day
"The Scotch Barracks."</p>

<p>I had been settled in my apartments a few days
only, when I perceived from my windows during

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

the morning, a constant passing and repassing
of pretty-looking women, with a certain perking, 
jerking pace, gaily dressed, particularly smart
about the feet and ankles, with parasols over
their heads, and little rolls of paper in their
hands; and men with their hats on one side,
and frills, and chains, and frogged coats with
fur collars, although it was May! and I heard
them hum songs and quaver out cantabiles as
they swaggered down the street and up the
street. I thought I could not be mistaken in
their vocation, and thrust my head out of the
window to watch where they went, for the street
was a <i>cul de sac</i>, and the only place to which I
fancied they could resort was a sort of tavern,
which I one day explored, in the right-hand
corner. To my surprise I saw them all enter a
house exactly opposite that tavern&mdash;then I saw
a smart chariot drive up and stop at the same
place&mdash;then I saw come out of it two well-known 
London performers. I was delighted&mdash;I 
was in the middle of Attica&mdash;in the region of
Thespis. I rang the bell, and inquired of the

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

rosy-cheeked maid of the house, what place
"that was?" pointing to the spot whence the
stars disappeared from my sight.</p>

<p>"La! Sir," said the girl, "don't <i>you</i> know?
that's the stage-door of the Little Thĕātre."</p>

<p>What charm had Lincoln's Inn for <i>me</i> after I
made this discovery? Here, in the plenitude
of my devotion to the drama, could I see all the
wit and beauty of the stage and the age in
constant motion&mdash;here could I hear them talk
in "<i>common parlance</i>"&mdash;and here I resolved I
would renew, or rather improve, my acquaintance 
with the agreeable Mathews, and endeavour 
by his means to procure the representation
of my farce, and the consequent <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of the
<i>coulisses</i>.</p>

<p>It sounds indicative of either grievous affectation 
or woeful ignorance that I, professing
myself theatrical, should not know where the
stage-door of the Little Haymarket was located;
it is, however, true that I did not till the housemaid 
enlightened me. No sooner had I obtained
the information, than my intuitive and instinctive

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

love of the "art" induced me to prowl up the
street and look into the dark dirty passage,
progress through which was checked by a well-spiked 
gate; there, however, my heart lingered;
and when my fellow pupil, who had just returned
from playing truant, called upon me, we partook
together the delights of this peep into Tartarus,
and joined in a sympathetic anticipation of the
privileges and pleasures we should enjoy when
my admirable two-act piece had been received
with unbounded applause by an "overflowing
and delighted audience."</p>

<p>How childish do all these anxieties and expectations 
now seem! How wonderful does it
now appear to me, that a mind which has since
been destined to bear with mighty evils, and
endure the saddest reverses without shrinking or
flinching, should have been so acted upon by
hopes and fears, and doubts and wishes, the
overthrow or fulfilment of which was, after all&mdash;for 
that was the great object&mdash;the power of
smelling "lamp-oil, orange-peel, and sawdust,"
behind the scenes of a playhouse!</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

<p>The Fates seemed propitious; for availing
myself of my previous introduction to the
modern Aristophanes, I addressed him in the
street the very first day I met him. There was
a frankness and plainness of manner about him
which quite delighted me; and after having
conversed with him touching my "farce," he
told me that he would not only read it, if I
wished it, but that he would himself present it
to Mr. Colman, with whom he was in habits of
intimacy. This was the very point I had been
longing to gain; and when my new friend
invited me to dine with him, at a cottage which
he then inhabited at Colney Hatch, on the
following Sunday, and bade me put my maiden
production into my pocket, I felt extremely
happy.</p>

<p>There must be constant alternations in this
world of vicissitudes. I left my friend full of
present gratification and future hope; I went to
my rooms, and there found a letter, of which the
following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

<p class="right">"<i>Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields</i>,<br/>

"<i>May</i> 26, 180&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I feel very great pain in writing to you
upon the subject of this letter; but I think it
my duty to do so, on account of your exemplary
mother, whose anxiety for your welfare is incessant 
and unqualified. I have received a communication 
from the gentleman under whose
care I placed you in Lincoln's Inn, representing
to me, for her information, the absolute uselessness 
of your prosecuting your studies under him
in the manner in which they are at present conducted. 
He says that he cannot consider himself 
justified in receiving a stipend while your
utter want of attention renders it impossible that
you should benefit by his instructions, or that
you should acquire either knowledge or experience 
from the practice of his office.</p>

<p>"Unwilling, however, to take any decided
step likely to wound the feelings of Mrs. Gurney, 
he begs me to offer you the alternative in

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

the first instance, assuring me that, if you decide
upon a sedulous application and constant attendance 
at his chambers, he shall be most happy to
devote himself particularly to your interests; but
that, if you do not feel yourself able to come to
such a determination, he must beg to decline
any further professional connexion with you. I
assure you this is extremely painful to me; but
as I said in the outset, I consider I am only
doing my duty to all parties concerned. Believe
me, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="right">"Yours, faithfully,<br/>

"A. G."</p>

<br/>

<p>This was awkward&mdash;it was unpleasant. I felt
I had acted wrongly, I was sure that my mother
would be vexed and mortified; but I could not
feel sufficient confidence in myself to promise
such amendment as my task-master required.
It appeared to me the wisest plan to go down
to Teddington and see my mother, and explain
to her my aversion from the profession for which
she had destined me. The truth is, that I had

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

no absolute necessity for any profession. I had
a gentlemanly allowance (for I was yet a minor),
and at my mother's death I should become possessed 
of an income more than treble in amount
to that which I at present enjoyed; yet I could
not say to her&mdash;dear, kind, excellent being!&mdash;that 
I anticipated any event which was to result
from the loss of <i>her</i>. I was quite certain that I
never should make a lawyer; and I resolved to
take my ground upon her own history, often
repeated to me, of my father's entire failure in
the same pursuit. But when could I go to her?
Here was Friday afternoon: I wanted to devote
a few hours to my farce,&mdash;I could not spare time
on Saturday,&mdash;and on Sunday it was to be conveyed 
to Colney Hatch to be read by a competent 
judge.</p>

<p>I remember when I was at school, two of the
boys proceeded to a pond, for the purpose of
swimming a gallipot, which was the property of
the bigger boy of the two. It chanced that, in
the eagerness incidental to this exciting amusement, 
the smaller boy tipped into the water, and,

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

after a good deal of struggling, sank, and was
drowned. After the melancholy catastrophe,
the bigger boy was questioned as to what efforts
he had made to rescue his companion, and his
answers made it evident that he had by no
means exerted himself to the utmost. This
conviction produced a severe rebuke from the
tutor; upon which Master Simpson burst into
a flood of tears, and said&mdash;"I <i>do</i> think that I
could have saved Green&mdash;but&mdash;if I had tried, I
should <i>have lost my gallipot</i>."</p>

<p>My infernal farce was <i>my</i> gallipot; and, to
advance the success of that parcel of trash, I
made up my mind to postpone my answer to
my kind friend upon a vital question, affecting
my future prospects, and delay my visit to my
mother, whose heart and soul were devoted to
my interests. I need not say, that, having
come to this resolution, I passed the whole of
the following morning in revising my work; nor
need I add, that, immediately after morning
service on Sunday, I mounted my horse, and
proceeded to the villa of my fostering patron.

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

I reached it in good time; was presented to his
amiable lady; and, shortly after, walked with
mine host to a small summer-house, which commanded 
a most agreeable view of the country,
where I began, with faltering tongue, to read
my production.</p>

<p>I saw that the effect it produced was not
disheartening. My auditor smiled, and sometimes 
laughed; but it struck me that his attention 
was somewhat too exclusively fixed upon
the part which, in case the piece should be
accepted, was intended for himself: indeed, my
apprehensions of his peculiar partiality for this
character were completely realized when, after
a little hesitation, he suggested the introduction
of two or three jokes&mdash;"hits," I recollect he
called them&mdash;into the speeches of that personage, 
the said "hits" being to be taken out
of the parts which were intended for other
actors.</p>

<p>Suffice it here to say, that I was quite satisfied
with the reception of my bantling, not only
from the manner of my host, but from what he

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

said upon the subject to his better half, and still
more from the announcement of his determination 
to take it over the very next day to
Melina-place, where Mr. Colman then resided.</p>

<p>To me this was perfect happiness. I enjoyed 
the air and the sunshine, and the dinner,
and the wine, and the conversation, which, as
the party was subsequently increased to six,
became extremely agreeable and animated; and
the favourable impression which had been made
upon me at my first meeting with my new friend
was even yet more improved as I became better
acquainted with him, and found, in his observations 
and remarks, not only all the wit and
drollery for which the world so justly gave him
credit, but a depth and shrewdness to which
much of the success with which he has been subsequently 
rewarded is unquestionably owing.</p>

<p>Having brought myself to what I call the
first halting-place of my career, I shall reserve
for to-morrow's task the record of occurrences
which immediately followed this very agreeable
beginning of my literary life&mdash;for so it must be

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

considered. Lincoln's Inn was fast disappearing
in the distance; and I resolved that, next day,
while my drama was undergoing the Colmanic
ordeal in St. George's-fields, I would make such
an appeal to my mother as might terminate my
suspense, and cut the Gordian knot of all my
difficulties.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> my head full of bright visions I returned 
to my lodgings, and having retired to
bed, passed a feverish, restless night. I had
heard conversations on subjects which were new
to me; I had been admitted into the secrets of
what, to a young and ill-regulated mind, is a
very striking profession; I had been told stories
and anecdotes of the private lives of public characters; 
and madder than ever with pleasure
at the anticipation of the enjoyments I should
reap from the acceptance of my farce, and my
consequent familiarity with the wits and the
geniuses and the players, I could not settle myself 
to sleep.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

<p>In the morning I arose unrefreshed, ate a
tasteless breakfast, and mingled the azure milk
with the almost colourless tea, without caring,
or even thinking, what I did. Still, however,
there was a clog of deeper anxiety hanging over
my mind than this fitful, feverish kind of irritation. 
I had to make a visit to my mother; I
had to express my regret as to the unconquerable 
difficulties which I thought interposed in
my path towards the Bench, or even the Bar,
and to decide the question so deeply interesting
to my respected parent as to my future career;
yet, somehow, my one day's association with
wags and worldlings had very much altered the
tone and character of my sentiments towards
the old lady. I felt rather ashamed of my dutiful 
anxiety about her, and wondered what had
hitherto made me so diffident in speaking out
my mind, which, in the end, I resolved to do,
cost what it might.</p>

<p>But a circumstance occurred the next day
which, at any other time, would have been
regarded by me as most important and exciting;

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

as it was, it made but little effect. My mother
had received a letter from my brother Cuthbert
(at that period more than thirty years old), informing 
her that he had been admitted as partner
into the great commercial firm in Calcutta, in the
service of which he had passed several years of
probation, and that he felt it would be greatly
advantageous to me, and, in short, open the
road to a splendid fortune, if I were to be placed
for some time in some banking or mercantile
establishment in London, to ground myself in
all the arcana of the counting-house; and, after
a certain period of education in that school,
proceed to join <i>him</i> in India.</p>

<p>At that time the amusing pursuit of "shaking
the pagoda-tree," once so popular in our Oriental 
possessions, had not been entirely exploded:
and, it must be confessed, the way in which he
wrote was extremely tempting to a young gentleman 
endowed with a strong disposition to
extravagance. Lacs and crores of rupees&mdash;maunds 
of cotton&mdash;pekuls of indigo&mdash;and a
thousand things of which I had never heard before&mdash;sounded 

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

magnificently; and, to a young
and sanguine mind, perhaps the novelty itself
was even more attractive than the vastitude of
the expressions contained in his despatch; but
more than all, when he described the women&mdash;the 
ladies of the City of Palaces,&mdash;their sway,&mdash;their 
charms,&mdash;their interesting indolence,&mdash;their 
lovely listlessness,&mdash;the amiable manner in
which they passed their mornings, playing with
their lank ringlets before looking-glasses, till
tiffin-time,&mdash;and then the amiability with which
they performed the ceremonies of that peculiarly-named 
Eastern repast.&mdash;This combination
of beauty, grace, languor, and tenderness,&mdash;with 
a detail of the vestibules, varhandahs, kitmaygars, 
hurkarahs, peons, palanquins, and punkahs,&mdash;influenced 
my mind for a moment, until
I recollected that the scenery of "Blue-Beard"
was infinitely more beautiful than that of Bengal; 
and that Mrs. Senior Merchant Mackirkincroft, 
or Mrs. Secretary Macnab, was,
after all, like the ale she imbibed, of home
manufacture, or rather, as the old joke goes,

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

like a pack of playing-cards made in England
for exportation, with a penalty marked upon it
if re-landed.</p>

<p>No, thought I, there can be no attraction that
way <i>from</i> England; yet I must own the prospect 
of great wealth had a dazzling effect for a
moment. It was but for a moment. A laugh
in the street attracted me to the window, and I
saw two of the <i>dram. pers.</i> (female) walking to
rehearsal, with a fresh breeze blowing in their
pretty faces, and pekuls, pagodas, peons, palanquins, 
and punkahs were instantly banished for
ever from my thoughts. Nevertheless, the letter 
required attention. The proposition was
one submitted to me by my mother, and must
be attended to; so I resolved, <i>co&ucirc;te qui co&ucirc;te</i>,
to make my visit to Teddington the very next
day.</p>

<p>Still I could not quite abandon my "gallipot;" 
and so to work I went upon my precious
drama, in order to write two comic songs, in a
style which was then somewhat popular. Indeed,
that of "Miss Bailey," which then continued

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

in fashion, afforded the strongest proof of the
effect produced by Colman in the narrative
style. It has been translated into Greek, Latin,
French, and German; and I am not quite sure
that it is not completely the rage at this moment
in the best circles of Spitzbergen and Kamtschatka. 
As proofs of what a young author
fancies good, I have preserved from the wreck
of my papers these two "poetical" efforts; and
I am sure that, at the time I wrote them, I fancied 
them quite equal to O'Keefe, or Dibdin,
or even Colman himself. Nothing is more extraordinary 
than a reference to such records, in
order to prove what were the feelings and opinions 
by which we have been acted upon at
some former period of our lives.</p>

<p>The first was to be sung in the character of
Sir Jeffery Boot-top, by Mathews, founded
upon an incident in real life: and thus it ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Song</span>.</p>

<p class="stanza">The plump Lady Tott to her husband one day
Said, "Let us go driving this evening, I pray."
    (Lady Tott was an Alderman's daughter.)
"Well, where shall we go?" said Sir Tilbury Tott.
<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->"Why, my love," said my Lady, "the weather is hot,
    Suppose we drive round by the water,&mdash;
            The water,&mdash;
    Suppose we drive round by the water."</p>

<p class="stanza">The dinner was ended, the claret was "done,"
The knight getting up,&mdash;getting down was the sun,&mdash;
    And my Lady agog for heart-slaughter;
When Sir Tilbury, lazy, like cows after grains,
Said, "The weather is low'ring, my love; see, it rains&mdash;
    Only look at the drops in the water,&mdash;
            The water,&mdash;
    Only look at the drops in the water."</p>

<p class="stanza">Lady Tott, who, when earnestly fixed on a drive,
Overcame all excuses Sir Til might contrive.
    Had her bonnet and parasol brought her:
Says she, "Dear Sir Til, don't let <i>me</i> ask in vain;
The dots in the pond which you take to be rain
    Are nothing but flies in the water,&mdash;
            The water,
    Are nothing but flies in the water."</p>

<p class="stanza">Sir Tilbury saw that he could not escape;
So he put on his coat, with a three-doubled cape,
    And then by the hand gently caught her;
And lifting her up to his high one-horse "shay"
She settled her "things," and the pair drove away,
    And skirted the edge of the water,&mdash;
            The water,&mdash;
And skirted the edge of the water.</p>

<p class="stanza">Sir Til was quite right; on the top of his crown,
Like small shot in volleys, the rain peppered down,&mdash;
<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->    Only small shot would do much more slaughter,&mdash;
Till the gay Lady Tott, who was getting quite wet,
Said, "My dear Sir T. T.," in a kind of half pet,
    "Turn back, for I'm drench'd with rain-water,&mdash;
            Rain-water,&mdash;
    Turn back, for I'm drench'd with rain-water."</p>

<p class="stanza">"Oh, dear Lady T.," said Til, winking his eye,
"You every thing know so much better than I."
    (For, when angry, with kindness he fought her),
"You may fancy this rain, as I did before;
But you show'd me my folly;&mdash;'tis really no more
    Than the skimming of flies in the water,&mdash;
            The water,&mdash;
The skimming of flies in the water."</p>

<p class="stanza">He drove her about for an hour or two,
Till her Ladyship's clothes were completely soak'd through,
    Then home to Tott Cottage he brought her.
And said, "Now, Lady T., by the joke of to-night,
I'll <i>reign</i> over you; for you'll own that I'm right.
    And know rain, Ma'am, from flies in the water,&mdash;
            The water,&mdash;
    Know rain, Ma'am, from flies in the water."</p>

</div>

<p>This was one of the effusions for the sake of
which I abandoned my studies, neglected my
parent, and expended two hours; yet I confess,
when it was finished, I thought I had "done it."
But I had another to do; for it had been hinted
to me, during the time that my maiden production 

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

was undergoing the process of examination
by the manager, that it wanted enlivening; and,
moreover, that if Mr. Mathews had a song,
Mr. Liston would expect to have one also; that
these were little points of professional etiquette
which were as rigidly observed as the rules and
ceremonies of other services; and that there
would be as great an impropriety in offering a
secondary part to a first-rate actor, or putting a
secondary actor into a first-rate part, as there
would be in giving a lieutenant a field-officer's
command, or sending a commander to commission 
a seventy-four.</p>

<p>I was somewhat puzzled for a subject, fancying 
that the songs of a drama should have some
reference to the plot and dialogue of the piece;
but upon this point I was very speedily enlightened. 
Instead of following the example of Gay,
in the "Beggar's Opera," Bickerstaff, in "Love
in a Village," or Sheridan, in the "Duenna,"
in which operas the music seems but an adjunct
to the dialogue, and the songs, the natural sentiments 
arising out of it, only versified,&mdash;I was

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

told that, much after the fashion of the man
who introduced his story of a gun, <i>&agrave;propos</i> to
nothing, a song, no matter what its subject or
purport, might be cleverly and properly introduced 
by three lines of preparatory prose.</p>

<p>This principle established, I had no hesitation 
in proceeding to my task. At that period
it was the rage to parodize tragedies. Horace
Smith wrote a parody on "George Barnwell;"
Horace Twiss did another; and Theodore Hook
indulged the town with one upon "Othello,"
and, I believe, an <i>extremely facetious</i> ridicule
of "Hamlet." The good taste of such proceedings 
I do not mean to discuss; that these
things <i>had been</i> successful was enough for me,
and I determined to follow in the wake, and
accordingly produced the following travestie of
"Venice Preserved," which was to receive additional 
point and piquancy by being sung with
an Irish brogue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">Tune&mdash;<i>The Sprig of Shillelagh</i>.</p>

<p class="stanza">Och tell me the truth now, and did you ne'er hear
Of a pair of big traitors, called Jaffier and Pierre,
<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->    Who thought that their country was shockingly served?
Who met in the dark, and the night, and the fogs,&mdash;
Who "who howl'd at the moon," and call'd themselves "dogs,"
Till Jaffier to Pierre pledged his honour and life,
And into the bargain his iligant wife,&mdash;
    By which very means was ould Venice preserved.</p>

<p class="stanza">The ringleaders held a snug club in the town,
The object of which was to knock the Doge down,
    Because from his duty they thought he had swerved.
They met every evening, and more was their fault.
At the house of a gentleman, Mr. Renault,
Who&mdash;Och, the spalpeen!&mdash;when they all went away,
Stayed at home, and made love to the sweet Mrs. J.,&mdash;
    By which, in the end, was ould Venice preserved.</p>

<p class="stanza">When Jaffier came back, his most delicate belle&mdash;
Belvidera they call'd her&mdash;determined to tell
    How she by old Renault that night had been served.
This blew up a breeze, and made Jaffier repent
Of the plots he had laid: to the Senate he went.
He got safe home by twelve: his wife bade him not fail;
And by half-after-one he was snug in the gaol,&mdash;
    By which, as we'll see, was ould Venice preserved.</p>

<p class="stanza">The Doge and the Court, when J.'s story they'd heard.
Thought it good for the country to forfeit their word.
    And break the conditions they should have observed
So they sent the police out to clear every street,
And seize whomsoever by chance they might meet;
And before the bright sun was aloft in the sky.
Twenty-two of the party were sentenced to die,&mdash;
    And that was the way was ould Venice preserved.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

<p class="stanza">Mr. Jaffier, who 'peach'd, was let off at the time;
But that wouldn't do, he committed a crime,
    Which punishment more than his others deserved;
So when Pierre was condemn'd, to the scaffold he went.
Pierre whisper'd and nodded, and J. said "Content."
They mounted together, till kind Mr. J.,
Having stabb'd Mr. P.. served himself the same way,&mdash;
    And so was their honour in Venice preserved.</p>

<p class="stanza">But och! what a scene, when the beautiful Bell,
At her father's, found out how her dear husband fell!
    The sight would the stoutest of hearts have unnerved.
She did nothing but tumble, and squabble, and rave,
And try to scratch J., with her nails from the grave.
This lasted three months, when, cured of her pain,
She chuck'd off her weeds, and got married again,&mdash;
    By which very means was this <i>Venus</i> preserved.</p>

</div>

<p>In this piece of tom-foolery I trace the first
fruits of that disposition to treat high and serious
subjects farcically, which is engendered and fostered 
in the society of those who, as my poor
mother said in her letter, from which I have
already made an extract, are habituated to judge
of real events histrionically. The effect the
thing produced at the time remains to be told.</p>

<p>Having done my task, I enclosed my effusions 
to my Mec&aelig;nas, and prepared for my
departure on the next morning to Teddington,

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

endeavouring if possible to fix my thoughts
upon the proposition contained in my brother's
letter, and upon the solicitude which I well
knew my excellent parent would feel as to my
decision; but I found this a much more difficult
task than the grave and sober-minded may suppose. 
The moment I had settled myself, some
trivial accident would scatter my thoughts; and
while I was pondering upon my future destiny,
I found myself singing the most important
passages of Cuthbert's despatch to the tune of
the "Sprig of Shillelagh," to which I had
written my ridiculous parody.</p>

<p>I was still in the agonies of suspense&mdash;eight-and-forty 
hours had elapsed, and no tidings of
my drama. Every man fancies his own affairs
of paramount importance. Dennis the critic came
away from the sea-side because he imagined
the King of France was sending a ship to carry
him off, in consequence of his having written a
severe squib against him in the shape of a pamphlet; 
and I once knew a young ensign who,
expressing to me his anxiety that a leave of

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

absence which was about to be granted him
should be correct to the letter, told me that he
was the more solicitous, as he had only entered
the service three days before, and the eyes of
the whole army were upon him.</p>

<p>It never occurred to me, while I earnestly
watched every knock or ring at the door in expectation 
of Mr. Colman's fiat, that Mr. Colman
had fifty other things to do besides reading my
farce&mdash;that perhaps he had never even opened it.
I did not then know the story of Sheridan and
the playwright, which is vouched for upon good
authority. The playwright had sent a comedy
to Mr. Sheridan for perusal, and of course
approval, and of course heard nothing more of
his comedy. He waited six months patiently&mdash;the 
season was then over, and he therefore
resolved to wait on till the next season began:
he did so&mdash;he then called at Mr. Sheridan's,
who at that time lived in George-street, Hanover-square&mdash;not 
at home, of course&mdash;he then
dispatched a note&mdash;no answer&mdash;another&mdash;ditto&mdash;another 
call&mdash;still the same result. At last,

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

however, the author hit upon the expedient of
posting himself in the hall, on a day in the evening 
of which there was to be an important debate
in the House of Commons. This was a blockade
which even the ingenuity of the wit could not
evade; the author was therefore admitted.</p>

<p>His inquiries were respectful, but earnest.
"<i>My</i> comedy, Mr. Sheridan&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to be sure&mdash;clearly&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"<i>Fashionable Involvements</i>, in five acts," said
the author, helping his great friend to the name
of his work, which he hoped might recall the work
itself to his recollection&mdash;a hope most vain.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said Sheridan, "I&mdash;I'm
in a great hurry&mdash;I really don't remember&mdash;I
am afraid your play has been somehow mislaid."</p>

<p>"Mislaid!" exclaimed the anxious parent of
the lost bantling. "My dear Sir, if it is, I am
ruined&mdash;I have no copy of it."</p>

<p>"It is very unfortunate," said Mr. Sheridan,
"very&mdash;I'm sure I regret&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what can I <i>do</i>, Sir?" said the author.</p>

<p>"I tell you what my dear friend," replied

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

Mr. Sheridan, "I cannot promise you your own
play back, because I don't know where any of
the last year's pieces are; but if you will open
that table-drawer, you will find a great number
that have been sent me this year: you may
take any three of those in exchange, and do
what you like with them."</p>

<p>Had I at the time when I was so sensitively
alive to the fate of my farce known this <i>historiette</i>, 
I should perhaps have been better able
to regulate my expectations.</p>

<p>On the following morning, however, I proceeded 
to Teddington, and found my mother and
her friend and companion Miss Crab, at home.
My reception was every thing that ought to have
been delightful to a fond and dutiful son: somehow 
it was unsatisfactory, and Miss Crab was so
plain, and the place was so quiet, and they began
to talk so seriously to me, and when I heard
them both expressing themselves sentimentally, I
could scarcely hold my tongue to listen to them.</p>

<p>"Gilbert," said my mother, "after what you
have said with regard to making the law your

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

profession, I think I should not be justified in
endeavouring to force your inclinations; but,
painful as it would be to me when the time came
to part with you, I do think this proposal of
Cuthbert's merits your best attention; you see
he is well established, his prospects are bright,
and he holds out his hand to lift his brother into
the same station."</p>

<p>"Why yes," said I; "but after all what <i>is</i>
the station? He is only a merchant&mdash;now the
law leads to the highest honours, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So it does," replied my mother; "but as
you have yourself decided against striving for
those honours, why try back upon what you
have rejected, in order to draw a comparison
unfavourable to that, which now presents itself?"</p>

<p>"I should never make a lawyer," said I; "and&mdash;I 
do not think I should like to be a merchant&mdash;there 
is something in the words shop and
counting-house discordant to my ear."</p>

<p>"I think," said Miss Crab,&mdash;and what she
said was true enough,&mdash;"Gilbert prefers being
a gentleman to any other occupation."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

<p>"He has not sufficient means to maintain himself 
in that character," said my mother, "and I
apprehend, that if he rely upon his talents for
dramatic literature to make up the deficiency, he
will only reap what alone grow in abundance in
that field&mdash;regrets and disappointments."</p>

<p>My mother had touched the right chord.</p>

<p>"Well, for <i>my</i> part," said Miss Crab, "I wish
there was not such a thing as a playhouse or a
player; they are the ruin of more young people
than anything else in the world."</p>

<p>I thought I never saw Crab look so frightful
as she did at the moment she uttered that little
speech.</p>

<p>"I do not quite agree with you there," said
my admirable parent: "I believe a well-regulated 
stage, speaking both morally and politically, 
might be rendered highly serviceable to
the people, not more for amusement than for
instruction&mdash;for when is instruction so gladly
received as through the means of rational amusement?&mdash;it 
has the same effect upon the mind as
indirect taxation has upon the purse&mdash;no sudden

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

and abrupt demand is made, which at once
enforces a claim, and proclaims a superiority.
If, through the medium of the theatre, morality
and virtue were exhibited in all their beauty,
and vice and dissipation held up in all their
deformity, great good might ensue."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Miss Crab, "but they are <i>not;</i>
all the things the people run after, now-a-days,
are either gingerbread pantomimes, culled from
Mother Bunch, or stupid farces translated from
the French."</p>

<p>Miss Crab looked more hideous than she did
before; but what could I say? Had I defended
the stage and farces, it would have led to endless 
controversies&mdash;Had I discarded them, I
should instantly have been doomed to a pair of
canvas sleeves, and perhaps an apron; posted
behind a counter, or stuck up on a high stool
from nine till six, with a pen behind my ear, in
some wretched hole of an office in a dark lane
in the City.</p>

<p>The great difficulty I had to contend with, in
these controversial conversations, as they threatened 

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

to be, and which I have before noticed,
arose from the fact that, although I certainly
had not at that time an income sufficient for the
indulgence of my favourite pursuits, and the
enjoyment of my natural amusements, as I held
them to be, I should be quite rich enough to
please myself at the death of my mother. If she
had lived to this hour, and I remained poor, I
should have been but too happy; and I felt it
impossible to explain to <i>her</i> the real grounds of
my apparent carelessness of my future prospects.
It was clear, too, that she was fast declining;
and this very circumstance rendered it utterly
out of the question to allude to an event which
seemed to me too probably not far distant. I
therefore resolved to temporize, and at last hit
upon an expedient which, before I had turned
my mind theatrically, perhaps would not have
occurred to me, in order to gain time.</p>

<p>I suggested to my mother what I considered
the inexpediency of plunging at once into mercantile 
life without some more distinct and
explicit statement from Cuthbert. All that he

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

said, tempting as I admit it to have been, was
said generally, and, for the most part, hypothetically. 
"I do not think it would be a bad
plan for Gilbert to do so and so;" and "if" he
did, he "might perhaps;" and "if he might
perhaps," why then, perhaps, "I might be able,"
and so on. I argued that this was an invitation
hardly strong enough to adopt as credentials for
the total alteration of my pursuits and prospects,
and what I considered my immolation in a
counting-house.</p>

<p>My mother listened attentively to what I said,
and appeared rather struck by my reasoning,
although she did not see that Cuthbert could
have said more, being, as he was, ignorant of what
course I had shaped for myself in England.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Miss Crab, "it is as plain
as the nose on my face&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked at her, and thought, whatever it is,
nothing can be plainer.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;that Cuthbert wishes Gilbert to go to
him; that there are bright prospects, the realization 
of which depends only upon his preparatory 

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

attention and assiduity here. If I were
you, my dear Mrs. Gurney, I would not hesitate
a moment."</p>

<p>I could have strangled her.</p>

<p>"There," continued she, "is that highly
respectable Indian house, Curry, Raikes, Yellowly, 
Lefevre, and Company."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us, Miss Crab," said I, "have
you made that firm, with all their orientally
bilious names, to terrify me?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, Mr. Gurney," said Miss Crab.
"I know them intimately well; and, if your
mother chooses, I will write to Mr. Yellowly,
who is my particular friend, such a letter as will
ensure you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;the highest stool in the darkest corner of
their counting-house," interrupted I, forgetting
at once my notions of temporizing.</p>

<p>"Oh! Sir," said Miss Crab, "if I am to be
subjected to such farcical remarks as these, and
you are determined to throw cold water upon
the scheme, I have done."</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Crab," said my mother.

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

"Gilbert's idea is not a bad one. He is yet
young. A few months' postponement can do no
harm."</p>

<p>"There I differ with you entirely, Mrs.
Gurney," said Miss Crab. "At <i>his</i> time of
life, and in the society and habits into which he
has fallen, six or eight months will make all the
difference in the world."</p>

<p>"I fancy," said my mother, "that I know
Gilbert pretty well; and I believe that, although
idle, and gay, and thoughtless, he will never
suffer himself to be led into conduct or circumstances 
likely to affect <i>me</i> or dishonour <i>himself</i>.
If we were immediately to avail ourselves of
your kind offer of writing to the gentleman you
have named, and he were admitted to a participation 
in the duties of his office, and, after a
severe probation of eight or ten months, Cuthbert's 
offer should turn out of less importance
than we at first imagined it, we should have lost
so much time."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Miss Crab; "wouldn't
Gilbert be much better employed posting ledgers

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

and copying letters all the day, than lounging
about the streets and writing farces? There is
no disgrace in a mercantile life; and supposing
he never went to India at all, what would he be
the worse for knowing what he would learn in
the City?"</p>

<p>I could scarcely listen complacently to the
odious interruptions and interference of my
mother's most excellent and disagreeable friend.
I could not endure the woman for talking so
sensibly; yet I saw that, with a parent's partiality, 
my mother leant very much to my views;
and I found, not without reason, that her readiness 
to acquiesce with me in the proposal of
giving time for consideration arose from a latent
unwillingness to lose my society altogether, and
doom me to a transportation for life,&mdash;for such,
a residence in India seems to those who have
never quitted their "fatherland," and who believe, 
with great reason, at all events where
England is concerned, that "there is no place
like home."</p>

<p>It was somewhat past ten o'clock at night

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

when I mounted my horse at my mother's gate
to return to London, and I must confess that I
felt as if I had achieved a great deal in the
course of my visit, in spite of fate and Miss
Crab. I had, in fact, left my affairs, as far as
regarded India, Cuthbert, and the partnership,
much as I had begun upon them, with this signal 
advantage in my favour, that they had
been under discussion and nothing had been
decided upon, so that I felt myself quite at
liberty to go on with a snaffle until my excellent
mother thought proper to apply the curb.</p>

<p>There was one point upon which the old
gentlewoman was particularly susceptible and
tenacious, but upon which, as it happened, I had
not yet seen reason to give her any uneasiness.
She had&mdash;next to the playhouses and the actresses&mdash;a 
most sensitive and matronly horror of
the designing wiles of the young woman creatures 
who enliven and illuminate the world; and
proportionably fearful that I should fall a prey
to some young adventuress, which, considering
what I possessed in the way of prize-money, was

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

really not ground for serious alarm; for it was
clear that nobody who had anything would think
of making a good speculation by catching a youth
who had nothing. She never went the length
of cautioning me against the artillery of bright
eyes, or the music of soft words, because being
a woman, although <i>my</i> mother, she perhaps was
aware that the surest method of setting a young
heart on, is by warning it off. "I'm driving
the pig to Cork," says Paddy, "but don't you
let him hear <i>that</i>&mdash;he thinks he is going to
Bandon." Prohibit, prevent, and warn, and what
nine times in ten are the consequences.</p>

<p>What happened to the ostler and the priest?&mdash;I 
believe it is an old story, but never mind&mdash;it 
is in point. An ostler of the Popish persuasion 
annually paid two shillings and threepence
halfpenny to his priest to confess and whitewash
him at Easter. Down on his knees did he lay
open his heart to the Padr&eacute;, and tell everything
he had done amiss during the preceding year.
"Father," says Paddy, "I water the whisky, I
take half a quartern out of every peck of oats,

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

and I charge fourpence for horsekeeping and
give my master but threepence."&mdash;"Tell me,"
says the Padr&eacute;, "do you never grease the
horses' teeth to prevent their eating the beans?"&mdash;"Never, 
your reverence, never!" cries Paddy,
with tears in his eyes.&mdash;"Good boy, get up
wid ye then," says the Padr&eacute;; "tip us the
thirteeners, and you are as clean as a whistle
for the next twelve months."</p>

<p>Those twelve months over, back comes the
priest. The same mummery goes on; the same
kneeling down and confessing to the absolving
Padr&eacute;,&mdash;whose infallible power of absolution is
best tested by the fact that the infallible head of
the Church himself, who can excommunicate
and absolve every Roman Catholic in the world,
confesses to his own particular chaplain,&mdash;and
there we have the ostler at it again; the same
questions are repeated the same admissions made&mdash;till 
at last Dominie reiterates his inquiry,
"Have you not greased the horses' teeth to
prevent their eating the beans?" Different
from that of the preceding year was the answer

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

to this&mdash;"Yes, your reverence, I have."&mdash;"How!" 
exclaims Doctor O'Doddipole; "what!
an accession of crime as you draw nearer the
grave! How comes this? Last year, you told
me you had never done such a thing in your life;
how happens it that this year you have?"&mdash;"Plase 
your reverence," says the ostler, "I'd
never have had sich a thought in my head if
your reverence hadn't been kind enough to put
it there."</p>

<p>Upon this principle, I suppose, my excellent
mother never directly cautioned me about the
sparkling eyes, the downy cheeks, the pouting
lips, and all the rest of the charms so likely to
catch such a person as I then was, lest "her
reverence should put strange thoughts into my
head." However, thoughts <i>had</i> been there,
without her putting; and I verily believe if my
new and absorbing passion for Thespian pursuits
had not unluckily intervened, I should have engaged 
myself to one of the very prettiest girls
in the world, who shall be nameless. However,
the sequel will show how that affair terminated,

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

and in what manner I escaped matrimony. In
the sequel, too it will be seen that if I were only
singed in my <i>coup d'essai</i>, I got considerably
more damaged in my subsequent career.</p>

<p>The one great point of delay having been
gained, I felt myself more at ease than I had
been for the previous week or fortnight. A
sanguine mind always sees daylight through the
darkness&mdash;and upon the principle and in the
hope, which all through life have sustained me, I
fancied that "something would turn up" before
the possible return of letters from Cuthbert,
which might favourably decide the question
now in abeyance.</p>

<p>On my return home, I found, much to my
delight, that my farce had been read&mdash;ay, and
approved&mdash;for a note which I discovered lying
upon my table, from my Mec&aelig;nas, informed me
that he would call upon me the next day at
five o'clock, if I happened to be disengaged,
take me over to Melina-place and introduce me
to Mr. Colman, who wished us to dine with
him. This, it may be easily imagined, was to

<!-- vol 1 page 72 -->

<i>me</i> as decided a "command" as if it had come
from George, King of England, instead of
George, King of the Dramatists; and I did not
allow a moment to elapse before I answered my
friend in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I scarcely recollect how the intervening hours
were passed; my friend and <i>ci-devant</i> fellow-pupil 
(who continued to "make believe" in
Lincoln's Inn) was of course apprised of my
<i>premier pas</i>, and I received his warm congratulations 
upon my initiatory success. The mere
routine of eating, drinking, and sleeping, had
in it nothing of interest, except as the performance 
of those ordinary functions served for
points by which to reckon time, until the hour
of my introduction to the Haymarket proprietor
was to take place.</p>

<p>That hour at length arrived: punctual to the
minute, my friend knocked at my door, and we
proceeded together to the scene of action. I there
found mine host everything that was agreeable.
I met four or five "ladies and gentlemen," all
delightful in their way. Mr. Colman suggested

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

one or two alterations, which it would be needless 
to say were improvements, in my drama;
and having despatched what I fancied our important 
business, we sat down to dinner, somewhere 
about six. How delightful the party
was, may perhaps best be imagined from the
fact, that we did not separate for the evening
until five in the morning, when I returned home
enchanted with the amusements of the day and
night.</p>

<p>Everything was now <i>en train</i>. The following
Friday&mdash;a day from which, for the commencement 
of any undertaking, I have a great and
unconquerable aversion&mdash;was fixed for the reading 
of my farce, and my eyes were gladdened
the very next morning, by seeing in the play-bills 
an announcement, technically (as I afterwards 
discovered) called "underlined," that a
new farce was in rehearsal and would speedily
be produced.</p>

<p>The Friday came; and for the first time in
my life I found myself in the green-room of a
theatre&mdash;it was literally a green room, into

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

which light was admitted by a thing like a cucumber-frame 
at one end of it. It was matted,
and round the walls ran a bench covered with
faded green stuff, whereupon the <i>dramatis personc&aelig;</i> 
deposited themselves until called to go on
the stage; a looking-glass under the skylight,
and a large bottle of water and a tumbler on
the chimney-piece, completed the furniture of
this classic apartment.</p>

<p>Upon the special occasion of reading my
farce, a table, with pens, ink, and paper, was
introduced, and deposited in one corner of the
room under the cucumber-frame, and at which
the reader was to preside. The actors and
actresses began to assemble. I was introduced
to such of them as were concerned in the performance 
of my hopeful work; and having
declined to undertake the reading myself, the
manager proceeded to execute that task.</p>

<p>A dead silence prevailed as he delivered, in a
hurried, monotonous tone, all the pointed and
witty dialogues of the first scene, upon which I
had spent so much time, and to which I had

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

devoted so much attention. Not a smile did I
see; Liston, from whom I had expected all the
compliments of excessive laughter at the jokes
introduced into his part, sat still and mute, the
very picture of gravity, until the reader came
to a bit which I had intended to be marvellously 
comic, when he made a face of so
grotesque a character of extreme disapprobation, 
that Mrs. Gibbs burst into a loud fit of
merriment, which was only moderated by a sort
of admonitory look from Mathews,&mdash;who had
the best part in the piece,&mdash;to spare the feelings 
of the young author.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour and a quarter did I
endure this purgatorial process; and I must
admit, that, during that period, my feelings of
self-complacency had undergone a very important 
change. Just as I anticipated a positive
cheer, at a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> which I was quite sure
must be unexpected, I looked round, and saw
Mrs. Davenport, the main-stay of my plot, fast
asleep, with her head in a corner; and the
aforesaid Liston, another of my props, tickling

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

her nose with the end of her parasol. It then
occurred to me, that it would have been better
that I should not have been present, inasmuch
as in my absence, those ladies and gentlemen,
who, regardless of my agonies and sensitiveness, 
thus practically exhibited their perfect
indifference to my "work," might have expressed 
their opinions in cabinet, and while
they disapproved some portion of the performance, 
might have suggested improvements in
others. When the reading was over, nobody said
capital, or even good, or even tolerable. One
of the gentlemen asked "When is this thing to
be put in rehearsal?" "To-morrow," was the
reply, "and it must be out to-morrow week."</p>

<p>"To-morrow week!" said one; "how am I
to study this infernal part, nine lengths and a
half, by to-morrow week, besides all the stock
business?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think," said Mrs. Davenport, "that <i>I</i>
should be better out of the farce than in it.
Mrs. Kendall, or Mrs. Wall, would do just as
well for all there is to do."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

<p>"Anybody would do as well as me," whispered 
Liston; and then Mrs. Gibbs made her
joyous, handsome face look hideous in my eyes
for the moment, by giving a sign of perfect acquiescence 
in Mr. Liston's opinion.</p>

<p>I felt that I could not endure their comments
any longer, so sought safety in flight, and got
out of the regions, into which at length, after
many years' working, I had obtained admission,
not, however, without attracting the notice of
my good-natured Mec&aelig;nas, who walked down
the street with me, and gave me his opinion,
that I must reconcile myself to lose one or two
of the principal performers; adding that it was
always the wisest plan to let a discontented
actor give up the part of which he complained;
for your leaders of the profession, if they say
they can make nothing of a character, generally 
back their opinions by their acting on the
first night.</p>

<p>Here began those difficulties and annoyances
by which the progress of a dramatic author is
impeded: the operation of small jealousies

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

which the uninitiated cannot comprehend; the
great vanities which the unenlightened are unable 
to appreciate; and the combinations for and
against certain persons and purposes, the intricacies 
of which are hidden from the common
eye, but the workings of which, more or less,
affect every individual brought into contact with
the dramatic department of English literature.
The thing, however, was too far gone to retract,
and I resolved to bear with fortitude evils which
I then was foolish enough to think great, and
submit myself to the guidance of those who, of
course much better than I could be supposed to
do, understood the nature of such proceedings.</p>

<p>The next morning was our first rehearsal.
The cool atmosphere of the theatre in a hot
summer's day, blended with the peculiar smell
which all theatres have, was to <i>me</i> quite refreshing 
and invigorating; and when I found myself
referred to by such of the performers as were
present, for <i>my</i> views and opinions of how <i>this</i>
should be said, and how <i>that</i> should be done,
I felt tolerably reconciled to the absence of

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

two or three of the "stars" by whom I had
hoped to see my work adorned and illuminated.</p>

<p>The efforts of five days perfected the work
of rehearsal. My "Venice Preserved" song&mdash;the 
idol of my heart&mdash;was omitted, because the
gentleman who was Mr. Liston's substitute
could not sing&mdash;a failing which I the less deplored, 
inasmuch as Mr. Liston, even if he had
acted the part, had declined singing the song.
My misfortunes, however, did not end here;
for as it had been resolved to omit that song,
and as the young lady who was to enact my
heroine sang no more than Mr. Liston's successor, 
it was considered not usual to have one
song in a piece, not musical, and so out they
cut my "Flies in the Water." I own these
two sacrifices cost me a pang, but it was decreed
by better judges than myself, and away they
went.</p>

<p>The time now drew near when my fate was
to be decided, and no rational person can possibly 
believe how much I was agitated on the
morning of performance. The sight of my

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

title, flaring in huge red letters in the play-bills,
was in the highest degree gratifying to my eye.
I stopped and perused the <i>affiche</i>, as if it had
been a document of the highest public interest.
I fancied I was known in the streets as the
author of the new piece&mdash;I walked upon air.
But as the evening drew nigh, I felt that
aching pain of anxiety, which in other days,
such interests could excite; and when it was
time to go to the theatre, I scarcely knew
whether I should be able to endure the trial.</p>

<p>After the opera of "Inkle and Yarico" came
my drama. I was placed in the manager's box,
allotted the seat of honour behind the <i>treillage</i>,
favoured by the presence of two of the handsomest 
and most agreeable ladies in London,
and treated in the kindest possible manner.
Overture over&mdash;curtain up&mdash;I listened to my
own words fearfully and tremblingly; not that
I heard quite so many of them as I had confidently 
expected, seeing that most of the low
comedians substituted, for what they had not
learned, speeches and dialogues, not one word of

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

which I had written; indeed, daring the greater
part of the first act, the voice of the prompter
was more generally audible than those of the
actors. Still, however, we went on smoothly,
but not with that spirit which I had anticipated;
and when the curtain fell, at the close of the first
act the audience gave no signs of approbation
or dissent, and the only sound which I heard in
any degree indicative of popular opinion, was
the loud twanging of an elderly gentleman's
nose, who was fast asleep, with his head reclined 
against the partition of the box in which
we sat.</p>

<p>The second act began, and in the middle of
the second scene of it, several parties removed
themselves from the lower boxes, evidently
tired with what was going on. Would that the
gods in the galleries had been equally well-bred! 
their patience, however, was not proof
against my drollery&mdash;one point of which, a cant
phrase by my hero. Sir Jeffery Boot-top, of
"How d'ye know&mdash;don't you think so?" appeared, 
after innumerable repetitions, to make

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

the first seat in the pit angry&mdash;they began to
groan, and then to answer Sir Jeffery's questions, 
with shouts of "No, no, no!"&mdash;these, by
a natural transition, were converted into cries
of "Off, off, off!" and at a quarter after eleven
o'clock, the green curtain of the Theatre Royal,
Haymarket, descended upon my condemned
farce, and concluded my career as a dramatic
writer.</p>

<p>I had anticipated a triumph&mdash;I had encountered 
a defeat. It was in vain I cracked the
joke of "laudatur ab <i>hiss</i>,"&mdash;in vain affected to
laugh at my own disaster. I rejected the gay
supper which had been prepared to await the
successful young author, and returned to my
lodgings ashamed to look even the servants in
the face; I hurried to bed, in the full consciousness 
of my failure, and the certain malevolence 
of the accounts of that failure, as they
would appear the next day in the criticisms
of the newspapers. I slept little&mdash;I made a
hundred different resolves&mdash;I hoped at least
my name would be kept secret&mdash;I anticipated

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

the misery of my poor mother at the publicity
of my overthrow, in which, she of course,
would find ample ground for congratulating
herself upon her unheeded efforts to save me
from such an exposure. I at length determined
to fly the scene of my mortification as soon as
possible, and by nine o'clock I had quitted my
lodgings, and was on my road to the maternal
roof at Teddington.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I cantered down towards Teddington, all
the events of the preceding evening passed in
review before me. I almost hoped that I had
only had a frightful dream, and that the scene
and proceedings at the playhouse were all
images of a disordered brain&mdash;but the hope was
vain; and already in the streets the playbills of
the day had negatively declared my defeat by
announcing "Peeping Tom," or "The Village
Lawyer," or some such ancient favourite, instead 
of a repetition of my doomed drama.</p>

<p>Breakfast appears to me to have been destined 
for a solitary meal&mdash;nothing to me is less

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

endurable than a breakfast party. I love the
lengthened lounging meal made up of eating,
drinking, and reading; but there is nothing
social or sociable in its attributes; one cannot
"hob-nob" in tea or coffee. Moreover, it is
an ungraceful meal. Egg-eating and prawn-picking 
are not delicate performances: and,
besides, a man when he is first up and just
down, if he tries his mind and temper by a
moral "spirit-level," will find that breakfast-time 
is not the time for company or conversation. 
Most especially, then, was I disqualified
for a <i>public</i> breakfast at my mother's on this
particular day, with Miss Crab for a companion.
I therefore resolved to call a halt at Richmond,
and take my morning meal at the Castle, an
inn full of delightful associations in my mind,
and where the coolness of the breeze and the
fragrance of the flowers promised to moderate
the fever into which I had fidgetted myself.</p>

<p>I was, however, mistaken; for just as one of
the waiters had arranged my table, and the huge
urn, hissing and sputtering forth its steam and

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

smoke, was put down, another officious varlet,
with a smirk and bow, laid upon the cloth the
"Morning Chronicle." Little could he conceive 
the dread and apprehension with which I
regarded the fatal sheet. New to the world, and
as thin-skinned as a Whig, I could not venture
even to unfold the paper. I waited till the
servants had retired, and then respectfully and
fearfully lifted the front page and peeped into
that part of the journal usually appropriated to
"theatricals." I saw the great word "theatricals" 
stare me in the face, and I hastily left my
hold and closed the leaf with the haste and trepidation 
with which, in after years, I might have
started back from the hiss of a snake or the
growl of a tiger.</p>

<p>At length, having fortified my courage by a
sip of coffee, I again approached the dreaded
page, and having with fingers as cold as ice
opened the paper, read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Theatricals</span>.&mdash;Last night a new farce
was acted at the Haymarket Theatre; as it was
finally and decidedly condemned, any further

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

notice of the absurd abortion would be superfluous."</p>

<p>After reading this short, pithy paragraph, I
felt that sort of gratitude to the writer, which a
culprit may be supposed to feel for an executioner 
who puts him speedily out of pain: there
was no tedious process of strangulation in this&mdash;no 
roasting before a slow fire&mdash;the bolt was
drawn and the spine of my vanity broken without 
any lingering preparation. I thought "absurd 
abortion" rather a strong term: but I was
glad to find that my name had escaped either
the knowledge or the notice of the critic. I
felt comparatively calm and easy, not at the
moment reflecting: that there were more newspapers 
than one, published in London.</p>

<p>It was in this temper of mind that I heard&mdash;it 
was then past eleven o'clock&mdash;merry peals of
laughter ringing by a company which, unperceived 
by me, had taken possession of the
pavilion which opens on the terrace at the back
of the house, and which appeared to be excited
by some waggeries of which I could not exactly

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

comprehend the nature or character. I never
was a listener nor an eaves-dropper; but the
most incurious person in the world will admit,
that nothing is so tantalizing as to hear laughter 
in an adjoining room without being aware
of its cause, and nothing so worrying as to be
treated with conversation through a wainscot
which never rises above a sort of mumbling,
grumbling noise, in sound something like what
Colman in his Preface to the "Iron Chest,"
describes as the distinguishing characteristics
of a great tragic actor's voice&mdash;"Flies in a
bottle&mdash;frogs in a marsh&mdash;wind in a crevice&mdash;and 
the drone of a bagpipe." I could not&mdash;fond 
as I then was of laughing&mdash;endure to
hear mirth going on, and not somehow contrive 
to be a partaker and participator. I
admit, therefore, that I protruded my head
from the breakfast-room window to catch some
clue to the gaiety of my noisy neighbours.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said one, whose voice sounded
peculiarly familiar to me, "I wonder where the
poor devil is to-day!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

<p>"Dangling on a beam in his garret by a
silk pocket-handkerchief," replied somebody,
whose tone and accent I also thought I recognized.</p>

<p>"No;" rejoined a third, "his suspense was
over last night&mdash;to be sure, my dear friend, the
idea of bringing out that infernal farce!"</p>

<p>"I did it to please the boy," answered somebody. 
"I liked the fellow, and could not say
no to the goose; but as for his farce, I admit
it deserved to be condemned as much as anything 
I ever saw. The only hits in it I put in
myself, but they were so overlaid by his own
original twaddle that they were lost to the
million."</p>

<p>I felt the blood tingling in my ears and
cheeks: the people were talking of <i>me</i>&mdash;I
thought I could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>"Well," said one of the amiable ladies, who
acted as my bottle&mdash;smelling-bottle holder&mdash;the
night before, "poor fellow, I pity him very
much; he may be foolish, and I think he is,
but he is remarkably good-natured."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

<p>"Perhaps," said some odious person, "you
will presently find out that he is good-looking."
A roar of laughter followed this, which had
nearly killed me.</p>

<p>"Saracen's Head!" said one.</p>

<p>"Buckhurst!" cried another.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said a third, "he is gone to tell
his mamma the history of his misfortunes."</p>

<p>"I believe she wrote the farce herself," said
a fourth.</p>

<p>"Well, poor devil," exclaimed the first speaker,
"let us leave him alone&mdash;his business is done&mdash;I 
flatter myself the shine was taken out of him
last night, and there's an end; so, what's to be
done till dinner-time&mdash;Patience in a punt, or a
drive to Hampton Court?"</p>

<p>This speech, so surely indicative of a move,
induced me suddenly to withdraw my head and
make a retreat towards the front door, where I
desired the waiter to bring my bill and order my
servant to bring the horses to the door.</p>

<p>Here, however, I was foiled, for scarcely had
I made two knight's moves over the chequered

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

pavement of the hall, before I found myself surrounded 
by the gay party from the pavilion.
Nothing could exceed their expressions of delight 
at finding me there; the poor devil hanging 
in his silk handkerchief, whom they had been
abusing five minutes before, was suddenly converted 
into their dear friend and delightful
Mr. Gurney. The group consisted of several
of my theatrical friends, and, to my utter
horror, they began condoling with me on the
annihilation of my farce before the waiters
and chambermaids, all of them declaring unanimously 
that it had been unfairly treated, and
that it possessed the most unquestionable marks
of great dramatic genius.</p>

<p>I then did not know the world quite so well
as I afterwards did; and when I saw the smile
of friendship upon the countenances of these
ladies and gentlemen, and felt the kind pressure
of their proffered hands, I also felt assured that
I had not been the subject of their conversation
in the next room, but that some other man and
some other drama had been so generally anathematised; 

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

and, perhaps, my ignorance was bliss,
for seeing how extremely happy they were to
meet me, and hearing how earnestly they pressed
me to join their party, I countermanded my
horses till the evening, and passed what, in the
sequel, turned out to be a very entertaining day.</p>

<p>It was agreed&mdash;and what would I not at that
period of my life have agreed to?&mdash;that some of
the party should fish, some walk, some row
about, according to their several fancies, and
that all should dine at the early hour of three;
the reason for the adoption of a period so Gothic
for such a meal being, that one or two of the
party had to present themselves in the evening
to the eyes of the admiring audience of the
Haymarket Theatre.</p>

<p>Among the group was a man, whose name
was Daly&mdash;who, of all the people accounted
sane and permitted to range the world keeperless, 
I hold to have been the most decidedly
mad. His conversation was full of droll conceits,
mixed with a considerable degree of superior
talent, and the strongest evidence of general

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

acquirements and accomplishments. He appeared 
to be on terms of familiar intimacy with
all the members of our little community, and,
by his observations and anecdotes, equally well
known to persons of much higher consideration;
but his description of himself to <i>me</i>, shortly after
our introduction, savoured so very strongly of
insanity&mdash;peculiar in its character, I admit&mdash;that 
I almost repented having, previously to
hearing his autobiography, consented to send on
my horses to Teddington, in order to accompany 
him to that village after the departure of
the rest of the party to London, in a boat in
which he proposed to row himself up to Hampton 
Court, where, it appeared, he had, a few
days before, fixed his temporary residence.</p>

<p>"I hope," said he, "that we shall be better
acquainted. I dare say you think me an odd
fish&mdash;I know I <i>am</i> one. My father, who is no
more, was a most respectable man in his way&mdash;a 
sugar-baker in St. Mary Axe. I was destined
to follow in his wake and succeed to the business; 
however, I cut the treacle tubs at an early

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

age&mdash;I saw no fun in firkins, and could not
manage conviviality in canvas sleeves. D'ye
ever read the 'London Gazette?' "</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said I.</p>

<p>"In that interesting paper," said Daly, "I
used to look twice a week to see the price of
Muscovados. One hapless Saturday I saw my
father's name along with the crush: the affair
was done&mdash;settled; dad went through the usual
ceremony, and came out of Guildhall as white as
one of his own superfine lumps. Refreshed by
his ruin, my exemplary parent soon afterwards
bought a house in Berkeley-square, stood a contest 
for a county, and died rather richer than he
started."</p>

<p>"And you, I suppose, his heir?" said I.</p>

<p>"He had not much to leave," replied my
new friend. "He ran it rather fine towards
the close of his career. My two sisters got their
fortunes paid, but I came off with what we technically 
called the scrapings&mdash;four hundred a
year, Sir, is the whole of my income; all my
personal property I carry under my hat. Timber 

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

I have none&mdash;save my walking-stick; and
as to land, except the mould in three geranium
pots, which stand in my sitting-room window, I
haven't an inch. Still, Mr. Gurney, although I
have not a ducat in my purse,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">" 'Yet I'm in love, and pleased with ruin.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"I envy your philosophy and spirits," said I.</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Daly; "fun is to
me what ale was to Boniface; I sleep upon fun&mdash;I 
drink for fun&mdash;I talk for fun&mdash;I live for
fun; hence my addiction to our dear funny
friends of to-day. They just suit me&mdash;they do
nothing but laugh; they laugh <i>with</i> one when
present, and <i>at</i> one when absent&mdash;but to me
that is the fun."</p>

<p>I immediately thought of the "funny" observations 
upon myself, which I had overheard
earlier in the day, pretty well assured that the
voice of my new laughter-loving acquaintance
had not been the least loud in the debate.</p>

<p>"I admit myself fond of practical joking,"
continued my friend. "I don't mean in one's

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

own particular circle; there it is dangerous;
people are not always in the same humour&mdash;what 
they think uncommonly good fun one day,
they will seriously resent as an insult the next.
There's no judging with certainty a man's
temper of mind, and it is not easy to ascertain
how much melted butter a gentleman would like
to have poured into his coat-pocket without
kicking; I avoid that sort of thing, but on the
great scale I confess my addiction. Coming
here yesterday evening, I stopped the chaise at
the corner of Egham, to turn the finger-post at
the corner half round&mdash;sent all the people bound
for London to Chertsey, all the people destined
for Egham to Windsor, and all the people
destined for Windsor, to London&mdash;that's <i>my</i>
way."</p>

<p>"Probably," said I, "but not theirs. And
do you often indulge yourself in these freaks?"</p>

<p>"Perpetually," replied Daly; "I've whipped 
off every knocker in Sloane-street three
nights running&mdash;a hundred and ninety-four,
exclusive of shops; and if ever the project

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

of lighting London with smoke should be
brought to bear, I flatter myself you will hear of
my darkening the whole parish of Pancras, by
grinding a gimlet through a gas-pipe."</p>

<p>"These frolics must cost something," said I.</p>

<p>"Occasionally," said my friend; "but what
of that? Every man has his pursuits&mdash;I have
mine."</p>

<p>"I should think," replied I, "if you perform
such tricks often, your pursuits must be innumerable."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Daly; "pursuits after
me, you mean? I'm obliged to you for <i>that</i>&mdash;I 
see we shall be better acquainted&mdash;of that I
am now quite certain. One thing I <i>must</i> tell you
of myself, because, although there is something
equivocal in the outset of the adventure, I set
it all to rights afterwards, and will prove to you
that in fact all I did, was done for fun&mdash;pure fun."</p>

<p>I foresaw an awkward discovery of some sort
by the prefatory deprecation of criticism; however, 
I listened to my slight acquaintance with
complacency and confidence.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

<p>"You must know," said Daly, "that I once
had a brother,&mdash;long since dead,&mdash;and you must
know that he was my elder brother, and he
went abroad; I remained at home, and was my
father's darling&mdash;he fancied nothing on earth
was like me. I was the wittiest, if not the
wisest fellow breathing, and I have seen my
respectable parent shake his fat sides with
laughing at my jokes and antics, till the tears
ran down his rosy cheeks.&mdash;Nevertheless I <i>had</i>
a fault,&mdash;I cannot distinctly aver that I have
even yet overcome it,&mdash;I was extravagant&mdash;extravagant 
in everything&mdash;extravagant in mirth&mdash;extravagant 
in love&mdash;extravagant in money-matters. 
After my respected parent's death, I
lodged at an upholsterer's&mdash;excellent man!&mdash;occupied 
his first floor&mdash;but paid him no rent;
on the contrary, borrowed money of him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I, "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't frown, Mr. Gurney," interrupted
Daly, "you will find that it all comes right in
the end. I'm as honest as a Parsee&mdash;don't be
alarmed&mdash;I was then much younger than I

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

am now; and, although the world unjustly,
ungenerously, and invariably judge a man's character 
in after life, by the foibles of his youth,
don't be prejudiced, but hear me. I borrowed 
money of him&mdash;I consulted him upon all
occasions&mdash;he was delighted with <i>me</i>, I with
<i>him</i>&mdash;reciprocity of feeling, you know, and all
that sort of thing. My upholsterer was my
<i>cabinet</i>-minister&mdash;who better? who fitter to be
consulted when any new measure was on the
<i>tapis?</i> So things went on for a year, at the
end of which, I owed him fourteen hundred
and seventy-two pounds, thirteen shillings, and
ninepence halfpenny, without the interest."</p>

<p>"That was no joke, Mr. Daly," said I.</p>

<p>"No, but what followed was," continued my
equivocal friend. "My cabinet-minister applied 
for funds&mdash;I had none at hand. I therefore 
quitted London, and retired to the blest
shades of Holyrood&mdash;not that this sort of
constraint was at all necessary, for my friend,
the sofa-maker, never troubled himself to inquire
after me."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

<p>"Why, then, did you go?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, you see I thought he might," replied
Daly. "After I had hovered about Scotland,
seen the sights, visited the Highlands, shot
some grouse,&mdash;and a pretty job I made of that,
umph!&mdash;I returned to Edinburgh, and began
to be anxious to get back to London. I therefore 
took the resolution of killing myself forthwith."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" said I.</p>

<p>"Most horrible!" replied he; "nevertheless
I put that resolve into immediate execution."</p>

<p>"How?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"By transmitting an account of my death to
the metropolitan newspapers in these words&mdash;'Died, 
at Antigua, on the 15th March, in the
28th year of his age, Robert Fergusson Daly,
Esq., son of the late Thomas Fergusson Daly,
Esq., of St. Mary Axe, London.' "</p>

<p>"What earthly purpose could that have answered?"</p>

<p>"You shall hear," said Daly. "About ten
days after this announcement, having 'incurred'

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

for a suit of mourning, I proceeded to my
friend the upholsterer. Dear man, I recollect
his little white bald head peering over his desk
in the counting-house as well as if it were but
yesterday&mdash;in I went&mdash;made a bow&mdash;up jumped
my creditor.</p>

<p>" 'Ah, Mr. Daly,' cried he, 'then what I
have read in the newspaper is not true!&mdash;you
are alive and merry.'</p>

<p>"Upon which I, looking as grave as a judge,
said, with a long-drawn sigh, 'Sir, I see you
have fallen into the common mistake.'</p>

<p>" 'Mistake, Sir,' said he, 'no mistake in the
world! Why, I read in the newspapers that you
were dead. How those fellows do fib!'</p>

<p>" 'In this instance,' I replied, 'they are as true as
the tides to the moon&mdash;or the needle to the Pole.'</p>

<p>" 'Why,' cried he, 'you are not dead, for
here you are!'</p>

<p>" 'So I am,' said I, 'but I am not the Mr.
Daly who died in Antigua.'</p>

<p>" 'That's very clear,' said the old cabinet-maker, 
'for, as I said before, here you are.'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

<p>" 'Still,' said I, 'Sir,'&mdash;I thought the Sir
good&mdash;'you do not understand; I am the brother&mdash;the 
twin brother of poor Bob Daly who
lived here with you, and who has died, as I
unfortunately know, deep in your debt.'</p>

<p>" 'What!' exclaimed the upholsterer, '<i>you</i>
his brother! Impossible&mdash;ridiculous! Why, I
should know you from a thousand by that little
knob on your nose.'</p>

<p>" 'That may be, Sir,' said I; 'but I was born
with a knob on my nose as well as my brother.
I assure you he is in his grave at Antigua.'</p>

<p>"This astounded him, and he was proceeding
to ring the bell in order to call up the housemaid, 
who had made herself particularly familiar 
with my knob, in order to identify me,
when I pacified him by fresh assurances that he
was mistaken, and that I was come to settle the
account due from my late brother to himself."</p>

<p>"This," said I, "was all very funny, no
doubt; but <i>cui bono?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Nous verrons</i>," said Daly. "The moment
I talked of paying, all doubt ended; he felt

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

convinced that it could not be me, for he was
quite of opinion that at that time I had no notion 
of muddling away my income in paying
bills. So he listened, looking all the while at
my knob&mdash;you see the thing I mean, Mr.
Gurney," said Daly, pointing to a pimple; "till
at last I begged to see his account&mdash;he produced
it&mdash;I sighed&mdash;so did he."</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said he, 'this is&mdash;dear me, is it possible 
two people should be so much alike?&mdash;your
brother's last account before he went.'</p>

<p>"I could not help saying, 'He is gone to his
last account now, Sir.' If it had been to save
my life, I could never check my fun.</p>

<p>" 'Lord, how like Mr. Robert that is!' said
the upholsterer.</p>

<p>" 'What is the amount?' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Fourteen hundred and seventy-two pounds,
thirteen shillings, and ninepence halfpenny. As
for interest, Mr. Daly, I don't want it.'</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said I, drawing out of my pocket a
handkerchief whiter than unsunned snow, 'I
honour and reverence you. I can now account

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

for the high respect and veneration with which
my poor brother Bob used to speak of you and
write about you. You shall judge what he has
done;&mdash;he has died worth three thousand five
hundred pounds; the claims upon him are numerous 
and heavy; in his letter&mdash;the last I ever
received from him&mdash;he directs me to make an
equitable division of his property.'</p>

<p>" 'Poor fellow!' said the cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>" 'An innocent young creature, with three
children,' said I, 'first claims his care.'</p>

<p>" 'Dear me!' said the man. 'Rely upon it
I won't interfere there. No, no. I gave him
credit farther than he asked it. I won't visit
his sins upon those who perhaps are helpless,
and certainly blameless in this affair.'</p>

<p>"There was something so kind in this, that I
was near betraying myself; but I should have
spoiled the joke.</p>

<p>" 'After those,' continued I, 'you come next;
and, having divided his assets fairly, he decided
that he could, acting conscientiously towards
others, afford to pay you five shillings in the

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

pound upon the amount due; and, accordingly,
I have brought you to-day a sum calculated at
that rate&mdash;that is to say, three hundred and
sixty-eight pounds, thirteen shillings and sixpence, 
for I don't descend to fractions.'</p>

<p>" 'Well now,' said the honest old man, 'I
love and honour him for that. He needn't have
paid me a farthing. I knew not where he was;&mdash;and 
to think of me on his death-bed!&mdash;that,
Sir, shows good principle; and as you are so
like him in everything else,&mdash;and how like you
are, to be sure!&mdash;I hope and trust&mdash;don't be
angry, Sir&mdash;that you will follow the example he
set you in the last act of his life.'</p>

<p>" 'Then,' said I, 'you accept the proposal?'</p>

<p>" 'Most happily, Sir,' said he. 'I tell you I
honour his feelings. I had given the whole
thing up as lost. I thought he was a hard-hearted 
and a practised taker-in of credulous
men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said I, bowing, 'you little knew my
poor brother Bob if you thought that. Here,
Sir, is the money; all I ask, as a satisfaction to

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

the interesting young creature who survives
him, is a receipt in full of all demands as against
him.'</p>

<p>" 'In course, Mr. Daly,' said the upholsterer,
taking the notes I proffered. 'Why, la!' exclaimed 
he, 'I declare you have got the very
ring on, that I have seen a hundred times, with
a leetel patent key twisted into the inside, that
he used to wear.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' said I, rather taken aback at this; for
with all my cunning I had forgotten to dis-ring
my finger for the occasion. 'Yes, it was the
only thing he left me; and I wear it for his sake.'</p>

<p>" 'And how well it fits!' said the cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>" 'Often the case with twins,' said I. 'There
are two hundred, three hundred, and fifty, a ten
pound note, eight guineas, and five shillings and
sixpence; count it yourself.'</p>

<p>" 'And now,' said he, 'I am to give you a
receipt in full; to be sure I will. But I do wish
you would do me one favour, Sir,' continued he;
'I wish you would let my housemaid Becky see

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

you; she was very fond of your poor brother,
and very attentive to him, and I should&mdash;I
know it is taking a great liberty&mdash;I should like
her to see you.'</p>

<p>" 'I should be too happy,' said I, trembling
at the apprehension that the girl, who was more
than usually civil to me while I lived in the
lodgings, should make her appearance, convinced 
that she would not be deceived as to
the identity, or believe in the story of two
brothers having the same knobs on their noses;
'but don't you think it might shock the poor
young woman?'</p>

<p>" 'No, no, Sir,' said he, looking over a black
leather book for a proper stamp; 'Becky isn't
frightened at trifles; shall I ring?'</p>

<p>"I could not help myself, and Becky was
summoned. Luckily, however, she had just
stepped out to get something, and satisfied, by
the way in which the other servant conveyed
the intelligence to her master, that it was not
very probable she would soon return, I screwed
my courage to the sticking-place, and remained

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

until he had written, signed, and delivered my
entire acquittance from my whole debt, in consideration 
of the receipt of 368<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; having
secured which, I made my bow and left my
upholsterer, not ill pleased with the adventure
of the day."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said I, after I had heard this
narrative, "but I see no joke in all this: it
appears to me that a person less favourably
disposed than myself would find a very different
name for such a proceeding."</p>

<p>"So would anybody," said my valuable friend,
"if it were not for the sequel. A short time
after, I had the means to set all right, and lost
no time in doing so; I confessed my <i>ruse</i> to my
worthy friend, made him laugh heartily at his
own credulity, paid him the difference, and
gave Becky a guinea or two."</p>

<p>I honestly confess, that although my new
friend polished off the end of his story with a
few retributive facts, the account of his adventure 
with the cabinet-maker did not very much
elevate him in my opinion, and I began again

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

to repent of having hastily engaged myself as
passenger in his boat, so appropriately, as he
himself said, called a "funny." The only consolation 
I could afford myself arose from the
consideration that our connexion would not be
of long duration&mdash;that it need never be renewed&mdash;that 
few people, if any, would see me in my
way up the river&mdash;and that, from all I had heard
of him from himself, he did not appear likely to
die a watery death, so that my personal safety
was rather guaranteed than not, by my having
placed myself under his command in our aquatic
excursion.</p>

<p>I had never seen such a man before, nor have
I ever seen such a one since: from the time
he sat down to dinner till all was done, his
tongue never ceased&mdash;he was <i>au fait</i> at everything&mdash;played 
billiards better than anybody I
ever saw&mdash;jumped higher&mdash;imitated birds and
beasts, including men, women, and children more
correctly&mdash;caught more fish in an hour than all
the rest of the punters did in three&mdash;sang all
sorts of songs&mdash;made speeches&mdash;and told stories

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

of himself which would have made my poor
mother's hair stand on end. One of his practical 
jokes, played off upon one of the ladies of
our party, I must set down. She had never
been at Richmond before, or if she had, knew
none of the little peculiarities attached to it.
He desired the waiter to bring some "maids of
honour"&mdash;those cheesecakes for which the place
has been time out of mind so celebrated. The
lady stared and then laughed; Daly saw her
surprise, and elicited all he wanted&mdash;her innocent 
question of "What do you mean by maids
of honour?" "Dear me," said he, "don't you
know that this is so courtly a place, and so completely 
under the influence of state etiquette,
that everything in Richmond is called after the
functionaries of the palace? What are called
cheesecakes elsewhere, are here called maids of
honour; a capon is a lord chamberlain; a goose,
a lord steward; a roast pig is a master of the
horse; a pair of ducks, grooms of the bedchamber; 
and a gooseberry tart, a gentleman usher
of the black rod; and so on."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

<p>The unsophisticated lady was taken in; and
with all the confidence which Daly's gravity
inspired, when she actually saw the maids of
honour make their appearance in the shape of
cheesecakes, convulsed the whole party, by
turning to the waiter and desiring him, in a
sweet but decided tone, to bring her a gentleman 
usher of the black rod, if they had one in
the house, quite cold.</p>

<p>These were the sort of <i>plaisanteries</i> (<i>mauvaises</i>, 
if you will) in which this most extraordinary 
person indulged. In the sequel, I had
occasion to see his versatile powers more profitably 
engaged, and which led me to reflect somewhat 
more seriously upon the adventure of the
upholsterer and the receipt in full of all demands.</p>

<p>The dinner was rather inconveniently despatched, 
in order to suit the convenience of
the engaged performers, and by seven o'clock
my new friend and myself were left to commence 
our voyage up the river. His spirits
appeared even higher than they had been before, 

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

and I felt myself, when consigned to his
care, something in the same situation as Mr.
O'Rourke on the eagle's back: whither I was to
be carried by his influence, or how to be dashed
down when he got tired of me, I could not
clearly comprehend; nor were my apprehensions 
of consequences in any satisfactory degree
diminished when my perilous companion commenced 
a violent wordy attack upon a very
respectable round-bodied gentleman who was
sitting squeezed into the stern-sheets of a skiff,
floating most agreeably to himself adown the
stream, the gentle south-west breeze giving the
sail of his boat a shape very similar to that of
his equally well-filled white dimity waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Hollo!" cried my friend Daly; "I say, you
Sir, what are you doing in that boat?"</p>

<p>The suburban Josh maintained a dignified
silence.</p>

<p>"I say, you Sir," continued the undaunted
joker, "what are you doing there? you have
no business in that boat, and you know it!"</p>

<p>A slight yaw of the skiff into the wind's eye

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

was the only proof of the stout navigator's
agitation.</p>

<p>Still Daly was inexorable, and he again called
to the unhappy mariner to get out of the boat.
"I tell you, my fat friend," cried he, "you
have no business in that boat!"</p>

<p>Flesh and blood could not endure this reiterated 
declaration. The ire of the Cockney
was roused. "No business in this boat, Sir!"
cried he; "what d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," said Daly; "you have
no business in it, and I'll prove it."</p>

<p>"I think, Sir, you will prove no such thing,"
said the navigator, whose progress through the
water was none of the quickest; "perhaps you
don't know, Sir, that this is my own pleasure-boat?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Daly, "now you <i>have</i> it&mdash;no
man can have any <i>business</i> in a <i>pleasure</i>-boat.
Good day, Sir. That's all."</p>

<p>I confess I was a good deal shocked at this
mode of terminating the colloquy. However,
no ill consequences arose; the fat man went his

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

way, and so did we, and in a few minutes more
embarked in Daly's "pleasure"-boat, in which
I felt, according to his dictum, that I had no
business whatever.</p>

<p>Richmond, which seems, every time one sees
it, as if it were dressed to look lovely for that
particular day, was smiling in all its radiance
and gaiety; the velvet meadows of Twickenham,
studded with noble trees, looked cooler and
greener than ever; and my friend began to
perform that incomprehensibly agreeable exercise 
of pulling up against the stream, when all
at once a thought seemed to flash upon his
mind, and a look of regret sadden his countenance; 
the expression was too distinct to be
mistaken or disregarded.</p>

<p>"What," said I, "what is the matter? have
you left anything behind?"</p>

<p>"No," said he, laughing; "but if I had
thought of it, we would not have come away
so soon from Richmond; and I would have
shown you some sport in Cockney-catching."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked innocent I.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

<p>"A trick specially my own," replied Daly,
"to be played with the greatest success between
the grounds of Sion and Kew Gardens. Thus:&mdash;In 
the dusk of the evening&mdash;I prescribe
scientifically&mdash;take a strong line, fix him to
a peg in the bank of Sion, carry him across
the river, and fix him to another peg in the
bank of Kew; strain him tight, and then retire
to watch the effect. Tide running down, presently 
comes a Cockney-couple, the man flirting 
and pulling, the lady sitting and smiling:
when they reach the chosen spot, the tight line
catches the Cockney Corydon on the back of
his head, and tumbles him forward at the feet
of his Phyllis; in a twinkling, the same effect
is produced on the lady, with this single simple
difference, that the cord catches <i>her</i> under the
chin, and tumbles her backwards. In the confusion 
of the moment, tide ebbing fast, the happy
pair are swept down the stream; and having,
after the lapse of few minutes, set themselves
to rights again, begin to wonder what has happened, 
and of course never think of trying back

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

against tide to ascertain the cause; which, however, 
if they did, would assist them little, for the
moment you have caught your Cockneys you cast
off the line from the peg, and the cause of the
mischief disappears from the sight&mdash;<i>probatum est</i>."</p>

<p>"That seems rather a serious joke," said I.</p>

<p>"Umph!" replied Daly; "perhaps you
would prefer keeping the line, but for my
part I am not particular."</p>

<p>This he certainly need not have mentioned.
Every moment added fresh evidence to the fearful 
fact; I was yet unprepared for what was to
come.</p>

<p>"I wish," said my friend, as he plied the oar,
"that we had stayed a little longer at Richmond. 
I think one more bottle of claret, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, 
would have been vastly agreeable."</p>

<p>"I should not have disliked it myself," said I.
"Is it impossible to repair the mischief?&mdash;is
there no agreeable retreat on these shores, in
which we may solace ourselves for our imprudence?"</p>

<p>"No," said my friend: "the Eel-pie House

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

is a wretched hole&mdash;the inns at Twickenham are
all inland&mdash;there is nothing marine short of the
Toy, and we are to part long before I reach that
much-loved spot."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "we must make up our
minds to the evil, and bear it as well as we can."</p>

<p>At this moment we were under the bank of
a beautiful garden, upon which opened a spacious 
bow-windowed dinner-room, flanked by an
extensive conservatory. Within the circle of
the window was placed a table, whereon stood
bottles and decanters, rising, as it were, from
amidst a <i>cornucopia</i> of the choicest fruits.
Around this table were seated a highly respectable 
family; a portly gentleman, whose cheeks
and chin gave ample evidence that such refections 
were "his custom always in the afternoon,"
and near him a lady, evidently his better, if not
his larger half&mdash;on either side bloomed two
young creatures, unquestionably the daughters
of the well-fed pair. Our appearance, although
the lawn was some twenty or thirty yards in
depth, had caught their attention, as their respective 

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

forms and figures had attracted our
notice.</p>

<p>"There," said I, "this scene is exhibited to
us by our evil genius, to tantalize us with the
prospect we may not enjoy."</p>

<p>"You are wrong," said Daly, "quite wrong&mdash;be 
quiet&mdash;beautiful girls, cool wine, and
agreeable society, are worth making a dash for.
Those girls will we become acquainted with&mdash;that 
society will we join&mdash;those wines will we
imbibe."</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" said I.</p>

<p>"Never saw them by any chance in my life,"
said Daly; "but here goes&mdash;the thing is settled&mdash;arranged&mdash;done. 
Have you a pocket-book
and a pencil about you? if you have, lend
them to <i>me;</i> say nothing, and I will manage
the rest. Assent to all I assert, and stay in the
boat till we are invited to partake of the collation."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Sir," said I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mum," said Daly, at the same moment
pulling the head of his funny "chock block,"

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

as the sailors say, into the bank of the garden,
upon whose velvet surface he jumped with the
activity of an opera-dancer. I sat in amazement, 
doubting what he was about to do, and
what I should do myself. The first thing I saw,
was my friend pacing in measured steps along
the front of the terrace. He then affected to
write down something in my book&mdash;then he
stopped&mdash;raised his hand to his eyes, as if to
make an horizon in order to obtain a level&mdash;then 
noted something more&mdash;and then began to
pace the ground afresh.</p>

<p>"Bring the staff out of the boat," said he to
me, with an air of command, which was so
extremely well assumed that I scarcely knew
whether he were in joke or in earnest. I
obeyed and landed with the staff. Without any
further ceremony, he stuck the pole into the
lawn, a measure which, as he whispered to me,
while in the act of taking it, he felt assured
would bring things to a crisis.</p>

<p>Sure enough, after a certain ringing of the
dinner-room bell, which we heard, and which

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

conveyed to Daly's mind a conviction that he
had created a sensation, a butler, <i>bien poudr&eacute;</i>, in
a blue coat, white waistcoat, and black <i>et ceteras</i>,
followed at a properly-graduated distance by a
strapping footman, in a blue and scarlet livery,
were seen approaching. I thought the next
step would be our sudden and unceremonious
expulsion from the Eden we had trespassed
upon&mdash;not so my friend, who continued pacing,
and measuring, and "jotting down," until the
minister for the home department was at his
elbow.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said the
butler, "but&mdash;my master's compliments, begs
to know what your pleasure here is&mdash;it is not
usual for strangers to land&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly like the man in the boat, Sir,"
said Daly, "only quite the reverse. I am not
here for pleasure&mdash;business calls me here&mdash;duty, 
Sir&mdash;duty. Here, Mr. Higgins, carry
the staff to that stump."</p>

<p>These words were addressed to me, and I,
completely infatuated&mdash;fascinated, like the bird

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

by the rattle-snake&mdash;did as I was told, not
daring to rebel, lest a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> might ensue,
which would <i>&eacute;clater</i> in our being jointly and
severally kicked into the river, in which case,
from the very little, or rather the very great deal,
which I had seen of my companion during our
short acquaintance, I felt perfectly certain that
<i>I</i> should sink, and <i>he</i> would swim, and that
while I was floundering in all the agonies of
ignominy and disgrace, he would be capering
and flourishing with the two pretty girls in the
dining-room, laying all the blame of the affair
upon my most incompetent shoulders, and
cracking his jokes upon the tyro who had so
blunderingly botched the business.</p>

<p>The butler, who found that he made very
little impression upon Daly, seemed inclined
to come at <i>me</i>, which, as I had not the slightest
idea of the game my companion was playing,
nor the faintest notion what he expected to
be the result, alarmed me considerably. Daly
was too much on the alert however, to permit
me to be cross-questioned.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

<p>"Sir," said he to the butler, "present my
compliments to your master, and make my humble 
apologies for the liberty I am obliged to
take. I am the acting Deputy Assistant Surveyor 
of the Grand Junction Paddington Canal
Company, and an Act of Parliament is just
about to be applied for, to construct and cut a
branch from the basin at Brentford, into the
river Thames, near this point. A great deal
depends upon my decision as to the line it will
take, and I should not have ventured to land
without apprising your master of my business,
but that no time is to be lost, inasmuch as my
plan for the cut must be ready for the committee
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Cut a canal through my master's grounds,
Sir?" said the butler.</p>

<p>"Right through," said Daly, poking the fore-finger 
of his right hand very nearly into the
butler's left eye; "and what I am now so particular 
about is, I am most anxious that the line
should not take down the corner of the conservatory."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

<p>"Dear me, Sir," said the man, "my mistress
would go mad at the very thought of such a
thing. Will you just wait, Sir, while I speak
to Sir Timothy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he, "and assure him&mdash;assure 
Sir Timothy&mdash;that I will do all I can to
preserve the elevation of his mansion; for, as it
all depends upon my opinion, I shall of course
be extremely scrupulous how I decide."</p>

<p>"I am sure, Sir," said the astounded and
mollified butler, "Sir Timothy will be greatly
obliged to you. I'll be back directly, Sir."</p>

<p>Saying which the butler returned to the
house, and giving a significant look to the strapping 
footman, with the grenadier shoulders and
balustrade legs, which seemed to imply that he
need not kick us into the water till he had consulted 
his master, the fellow followed him, which
afforded me an opportunity of asking my volatile 
friend what the deuce he was at.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," said he&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Women and wine compare so well,

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

<p>I am the Company's acting Deputy Assistant

Yes, Mr. Gurney, as King Arthur says&mdash;</p>

<p class="stanza">'It is our royal will and pleasure to be drunk,

<p>Who knows but we may make an agreeable and
permanent acquaintance with this interesting
family!"</p>

<p>"But," said I, "you don't even know their
name."</p>

<p>"You are in error," replied Daly, "the man's
name <i>is</i> known to me."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you are known to <i>him</i>,"
said I.</p>

<p>"That is a <i>non sequitur</i>," said Daly; "I
knew nothing of him before I landed here&mdash;now 
I am <i>au fait</i>&mdash;my friend in the powder and
sticking-plasters calls his master Sir Timothy.
There are hundreds of Sir Timothies; but what
do I do upon hearing this little distinctive appellation, 
but glance my eye to the livery button of

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

the lacquey&mdash;and what do I see there? a serpent 
issuing from and piercing a garb or gerb.
The crest is unique&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, my new acquaintance 
is neither more nor less than Sir Timothy
Dod."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "you are, like myself, a bit
of a herald, too!"</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Daly, "in my composition 
are</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">'Arts with <i>arms</i> contending,'</p>

</div>

<p>I am a bit of everything; but somehow all
my accomplishments are so jumbled, and each
is so minute in itself, that they are patched
together in my mind like the squares of a harlequin's 
jacket, only to make their master ridiculous. 
Here, however, comes Sir Timothy
himself. You are my clerk&mdash;keep the staff and
the joke up, and you shall be repaid with some
of Tim's very best Lafitte, or I'm an ass."</p>

<p>"Good day, Sir," said Sir Timothy, somewhat 
warmed with the intelligence given him
by the butler, and the exertion of trotting himself 

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

across his lawn. "My servant tells me
that you are here for the purpose of deciding
upon the line of some new branch of the Paddington 
Canal;&mdash;it is very extraordinary I never
should have heard of it!"</p>

<p>"You ought, Sir Timothy," said Daly, "to
have been apprised of it. Do you understand
much of ground-plans, Sir Timothy?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir; very little indeed," replied the
worthy Knight.</p>

<p>"So much the better," I heard Daly distinctly 
say, for he could not resist an impulse.
"If you will just cast your eye over this paper,
I will endeavour to explain, Sir. A, there you
see;&mdash;A is your house, Sir Timothy; B is the
conservatory; C is the river,&mdash;that perhaps you
will think strange?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said Sir Timothy, "not at all."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, D, E, F, and G are the points,
from which I take the direct line from the bridge
at Brentford; and thus you perceive, by continuing 
that line to the corner of Twickenham
churchyard, where the <i>embouchure</i> is to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

<p>"The what, Sir?" said Sir Timothy.</p>

<p>"The mouth, Sir,&mdash;the entrance to the new
branch, the canal will clip your conservatory
diagonally to the extent of about eighteen feet
six inches, and leave it deprived of its original
dimensions somewhat in the shape of a cocked-hat 
box. You see&mdash;so, Sir,&mdash;H, I, K."</p>

<p>"I give you my honour, Sir," said Sir
Timothy, "such a thing would drive Lady Dod
mad!"</p>

<p>"I admit it would be a dreadful cut," said
Daly; "and then the noise of the bargemen,
and the barge-horses close under the windows,&mdash;clanking 
chains,&mdash;horrible oaths,&mdash;disgusting
language&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My daughters' bed-rooms are at that end of
the house," said Sir Timothy. "What am I to
do Sir? What interest can I make? Are the
magistrates&mdash;are the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said Daly, with a face of the most
imperturbable gravity; "all that would be perfectly 
unavailing. The decision as to the line
rests entirely with me; and, as I said to Mr.

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

Higgins, my assistant,&mdash;Higgins," continued
he, calling me to him, "let me present you to
Sir Timothy Dod,&mdash;I said to Higgins, what a
pity it would be to disturb the Dods,&mdash;what a
cut at their comforts;&mdash;it goes against my heart
to send in the plan, but the line is so decidedly
the shortest. 'Ah, Sir!' says Higgins to me,
with a deep sigh, I assure you,&mdash;'but <i>do</i> consider 
the conservatory.' "</p>

<p>"I'm sure, Sir," said Sir Timothy, extending
his hand to me, "I feel very grateful for your
kindness. It would indeed be a sad thing; and
must the decision be made so soon?"</p>

<p>"Immediately, Sir," said Daly: "but we are
keeping you out here in the open air without
your hat. I am afraid, Sir, you may catch
cold."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Sir," said Sir Timothy; "don't mind
that. Perhaps, gentlemen, you would do me
the kindness to walk in. The servants shall take
care of your boat. I will introduce you to Lady
Dod, she must try what <i>her</i> influence can effect,
and I am sure you have the disposition to serve

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

us. Here, Philip, James, George, some of you,
come and make this boat fast, and stay down by
her while the gentlemen stop. Let me show
you the way, gentlemen."</p>

<p>I never shall forget the look which Daly gave
me as we followed the respectable knight to his
lady and family,&mdash;the triumphant chuckle of his
countenance, the daring laugh in his eyes; while
I, who only saw in the success of the design the
beginning of a signal defeat, scarce knew whether 
I was walking on my head or my heels: resistance 
or remonstrance was equally vain under
the circumstances, and in a few minutes we
found ourselves in the presence of Lady Dod
and her daughters, breathing an atmosphere
redolent with the fumes of the departed dinner,
and the still remaining fruit and wine. I never
was so abashed in my life. My friend, on the
contrary, seemed perfectly at home; and, placing
himself beside her Ladyship, made a sign for
me to occupy a vacant seat between the young
ladies. Never did I see two more lovely girls.</p>

<p>It has frequently been a serious matter of

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

deliberation with me, whether it is more advantageous 
to be next neighbour, or <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, to an
object of attraction, such as either of these
charming creatures was. I sat between them, as
Garrick stands between Tragedy and Comedy,
in the profane theatrical monument which some
superannuated or careless Dean of other days
has permitted to disgrace and desecrate the
wails of Westminster Abbey. Augusta Dod
was a <i>brunette</i>, with a countenance fall of expression 
and intelligence. Fanny Dod a <i>blonde</i>,
with melting blue eyes, and a pair of lips that,
spite of my feigned occupation, I could not help
gazing at in a manner of which I believe I
ought to have been very much ashamed. The
young witches soon saw the effect of their fascination, 
and I could perceive in the sparkle of
Augusta's brilliant orbs, and the intellectual,
but saucy expression of her playful mouth, that
they triumphed in "astonishing a native," even
in the shape of an acting deputy assistant
surveyor's clerk.</p>

<p>The courtesy of Sir Timothy, the sweetness

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

of my Lady, and the constrained fun of the
girls, were, I admit, when I recovered my composure 
in some degree, a great treat; while
Daly, "helping himself and passing the bottle"
to <i>me</i>, kept up a fire of conversation, which, if
the senior Dods had known anything of the
world, would have convinced them in ten minutes
that the part of acting deputy assistant measurer
was an assumed one. It certainly was a sight
to see the respectable lady of the house pleading
the cause of her conservatory, and piling the
choicest fruits upon the plate of the arbiter of
her destinies, while Fanny's civilities to me were
displayed with equal zeal and far superior grace.
I would have given the world to have owned
the truth; and I am sure, if we had done so,
we should not have been the worse received;
for, independently of the excellence of the joke
and the impudence of the proceeding, the relief
which would have been afforded to the minds of
the whole Doddery would have ensured us their
eternal favour and affection.</p>

<p>Daly having finished the claret, and taken a

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

last "stopper over all" (as the sailors say), of
sherry, gave me the signal for departure. I, too
gladly took the hint, and drew back my chair.
Fanny looked as if she thought we were in a
hurry; however, it was getting late, and my
master had some distance to pull. We accordingly 
rose and prepared to take leave. I bowed
my adieu to the girls, and shook hands with
Fanny, at which I saw Augusta toss back
her head and throw up her sparkling eyes, as
much as to say, "Well, Fanny!" meaning exactly 
the reverse. I bowed low to my Lady
Dod, and Sir Timothy attended us to our boat.
I stepped in; Daly was at the bow; Sir Timothy 
desired the man who had been left in
charge of the funny to go away; and then I
saw, with doubt and trepidation, the respectable
dupe of Daly's consummate impudence shake
him by the hand with a peculiarity of manner
which particularly attracted my attention. I saw
him in the execution of this man&oelig;uvre press
upon his palm a bank-note, with a flourish in the
corner like the top of a raspberry tartlet.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

<p>I never was more agitated. If Daly took this
bribe for saving the corner of the conservatory
it was an act of swindling. The strawberries,
grapes, and claret, were fit matters of joke,
although I admit it was carrying the joke a little
too far; but money,&mdash;if he took <i>that</i>, I was resolved 
to avow the whole affair to Sir Timothy,
show up my companion, and leave him to the
fate he deserved. Judge my mingled delight
and horror when I heard him say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir! what I have done in your house or in
your society to induce you to believe me capable 
of taking a bribe to compromise my duty, I
really don't know. Mr. Higgins, I call you to
witness that this person has had the insolence
to put a fifty-pound bank-note into my hand.
Witness, too, the manner in which I throw it
back to him." Here he suited the word to the
action. "Learn, old gentleman," continued he,
with an anger so well feigned that I almost
believed him in earnest, "that neither fifty nor
fifty thousand pounds will warp an honest man
from the duty he owes to his employers; and so,

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

Sir, good night, and rely upon it, your conservatory 
goes,&mdash;rely upon it, Sir Timothy;&mdash;It
comes in the right line, and the short line, and
down it goes&mdash;and I feel it incumbent on me
not only to tell the history of your petty bribe,
but to prove my unimpeachable integrity by
running the canal right under your dining-room
windows; and so, Sir, good night."</p>

<p>Saying which he jumped into the boat, and
pulling away manfully, left his unfortunate victim 
in all the horrors of defeated corruption, and
the certainty of the destruction of his most favourite 
object, for the preservation of which
he had actually crammed his betrayers, and
committed himself to a perfect stranger.</p>

<p>I confess I regretted the termination of this
adventure as much as I had apprehended its
consequences in the beginning; however, Daly
swore that it was right to leave the old gentleman 
in an agony of suspense for having entertained 
so mean an idea of his honour and
honesty.</p>

<p>The thing seemed all like a dream, but

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

I found myself awake when Daly ran the
narrow nose of his boat into the nook at
Teddington Church, where I landed; and having 
shaken my extraordinary friend by the
hand, proceeded to my mother's villa, while
he continued his pull up to Hampton Court, at
which place, as he told me, he had been staying 
a few days, and intended to remain two or
three more.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> voyager long pent up within the "wooden 
walls" of a ship, feels a sensation upon once
again walking the "lean earth," which cannot
be adequately described to one who has not
experienced it. I confess, although the nature
of the effect produced upon me when I stepped
from Mr. Daly's "funny" was of course perfectly 
different in its character, yet as far as the
relief afforded me, it was almost equally pleasurable. 
It seemed to me that I had escaped from
some incarnate fiend, whose whole existence
was devoted to what he called fun, but which I
could not but consider absolute and unqualified

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

mischief; and as I walked onwards to my
mother's villa, I seriously revolved the events of
the day in my mind, at the same time forming
a resolution never again to subject myself to the
domination of a practical joker, although my
new friend had given me a pressing invitation
to visit him at Hampton Court, where he had
so recently established himself, and of which
sedate and aristocratic neighbourhood he would,
as I suspected, soon become, even by his own
showing, the terror and affright.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening when I reached
the gate of Mrs. Gurney's cottage, the mere
sight of which recalled all the misfortunes of
the previous night to my mind. The striking
contrast afforded by the quiet aspect of the villa,
the well-mown lawn, the gently waving trees,
and the gay beds of flowers, to that of the house
in which I had been but twenty-four hours before 
eternally disgraced as a dramatist, went to
my heart; while the parterre, full of roses, and
pinks, and geraniums, gently bowing their heads
and smelling sweetly, exhibited so refreshing a

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

"reverse" to the parterre of the Haymarket,
with its "greasy citizens." and yelling apprentices, 
that all my regrets burst upon me in a
flood of remorse and sorrow, and found utterance 
in one exclamation of "how <i>could</i> I be
such a fool!"</p>

<p>It was however necessary that I should summon 
all my resolution to bear the reproaches
with which I knew I was destined to be assailed,
if the news of my exposure had preceded me.
In vain I hoped that my respectable parent
might not have seen a newspaper, for I recollected 
that my servant, although not entirely
informed of my share in the entertainment of
the preceding evening, had made himself master
of so much of my secret as would serve to enlighten 
Mrs. Sadler, my mother's maid, of whose
disposition to find out whatever he was unable
to explain, I had no doubt; once the clue given,
and the train lighted, the explosion was a matter 
of certainty.</p>

<p>Full of contending feelings, somewhat excited 
by the rapid consumption of Sir Timothy's

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

claret and sherry, I entered the cottage, and
found, as I had anticipated, my excellent parent
seated at tea, opposite to her never-failing friend
and companion, Crab.</p>

<p>"Dear child," said my excellent parent,&mdash;and 
she would have called me child had she
lived till I was forty,&mdash;"what on earth has
kept you at Richmond so late? Have you
dined? or&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Dined? hours ago," replied I, rather too
hastily, considering it to have been my intention 
not to confess the company in which I had
passed the day.</p>

<p>"Theatricals again, Gilbert!" said my mother, 
with a sigh.</p>

<p>How the deuce did she know that?</p>

<p>"You were coming <i>here</i> to pass the day, but
the fascination of those syrens of the stage was
irresistible&mdash;we waited dinner nearly an hour
for you."</p>

<p>"More, Ma'am," said Miss Crab: "the
lamb was stone cold, and the fish boiled to
pieces."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

<p>"I am extremely sorry," said I, "but I told
William that I should not be here until the
evening."</p>

<p>"He misunderstood you then," said my
mother; "not that I should have waited at all
if I had known who were your associates. I am
quite aware of the attractions of such society."</p>

<p>My mother was evidently vexed, and knowing 
as little of the qualities or accomplishments
of my fair friends at Richmond, as she did of
the syrens to whom she likened them, imagined
them, as I believe, to be something quite as
extraordinary as the well-fledged daughters of
Achelous; and no doubt transformed the eyrie
opposite Mrs. Forty's excellent inn into the
little Sicilian island which the classical leash of
ornithological beauties occupied in other times.
If I could have explained the real cause of
my late arrival it would have all been extremely
well, but I would not for the world have ventured
to confess to my most exemplary parent, more
especially in the presence of the fair vinaigrette
"she loved so much," the adventure at Twickenham. 

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

I therefore resolved upon bowing my
head to the coming storm, and without attempting 
to vindicate the character or qualities of my
merry-hearted companions at the Castle, endeavouring 
to soothe the ladies with an humble
apology.</p>

<p>As for my mother, with great shrewdness and
knowledge of the world, she blended a remarkably 
sweet temper, but her constant association
with Miss Crab appeared to me latterly to have
somewhat acidulated her character. This officious 
aide-de-camp was always ready to throw
in the sours; and from having arrived at the
unmentionable age of fifty-six, without having
changed her state of single-unblessedness, all
the kindness of her nature had curdled, and, as
people say, every thing went wrong with her&mdash;<i>couleur 
de rose</i> was a tint unknown to her eyes&mdash;every 
thing was jaundiced&mdash;she was full of
jealousy, without one grain of love to compensate 
for her failing; and to <i>her</i> influence, more
than anything else, I attributed my mother's
apparent ill-humour upon the present occasion.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

<p>"Will you have some coffee, Gilbert?" said
my mother.</p>

<p>"None, I thank you," said I.</p>

<p>"Some tea?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no," said Miss Crab, "dissipated
people never drink such weak liquors as tea
or coffee."</p>

<p>"You seem," said I, "to have formed a very
unfavourable and somewhat erroneous opinion
of <i>my</i> character, Miss Crab; I am not conscious
of having deserved to be called dissipated, nor
do I know that I have either denounced tea
or renounced coffee."</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know," said the lady,
"but this I do know, that actors, and actresses
too, are invariably drunkards, profaners, and
Sabbath-breakers. When I was a few years
younger, and secretary to a very well-conducted 
Vice-suppression Society at Peckham, we
actually ascertained that a man of the name of
Pluggs, the husband of an exemplary and ill-treated 
laundress of that place, was known to

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

have gone on the evening of the Sabbath to
Covent-garden playhouse to which he belonged,
and put on a pair of feather trowsers and a
wooden nose, in order to rehearse the part of
a goose which he had to act in a pantomime,
the next night."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "at all events he had the
excuse of his poverty for making himself a goose,
which the coterie who criticised him had <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, I quite agree with Miss Crab," said
my mother, "there is no defending the thing;
and joking with serious subjects is extremely
offensive."</p>

<p>I found the odds were against me. I therefore 
made no reply, satisfied at all events that
the intelligence of my defeat as a dramatist had
not yet reached Teddington.</p>

<p>"I hope," said my mother, "that you are
come to stay with us for two or three days?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>he</i>, Ma'am," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>I could almost have found it in my heart to
declare my intention of stopping a fortnight,
merely to vex her.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

<p>"I have no engagement in town," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Miss Crab," said my mother,
"I think we may let him into our scheme."</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "a plot against me?"</p>

<p>"A plot for your happiness," said my mother.
"If you will but attend to us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no hope of <i>that</i>," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said I; "an immediate voyage
to India, or a fresh touch at the law?"</p>

<p>"Neither Gilbert," said my mother; "but
much more agreeable than either. Miss Crab
and I <i>have</i> seen&mdash;haven't we, Miss Crab?"</p>

<p>"I think we have," replied Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"Such a charming girl," said my mother.</p>

<p>"Two," cried her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, but the younger one is <i>my</i> favourite,"
said Mrs. Gurney; "she <i>is</i> so gentle, so mild, so
amiable, so pretty, and so good!"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "and what then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ma'am," said Miss Crab, "it's all of
no use talking to Gilbert about such sort of
people. A young gentleman who spends his

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

time with actresses has no taste&mdash;<i>can</i> have no
taste&mdash;for the gentler attributes of women, nor
appreciate the qualities which, in well-regulated
society, render their influence so powerful and
beneficial."</p>

<p>"I don't know that, Miss Crab," said my
mother; "I don't think he is yet irredeemable,
and I am quite sure if anything could draw him
back into the right path the charms of our dear
Fanny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, "a pretty girl is what you
prescribe as a sedative."</p>

<p>"As an alterative, Mr. Gilbert," said Miss
Crab.</p>

<p>"But you don't seriously mean," said I, "that
I should turn Benedick before I have arrived at
years of discretion?"</p>

<p>"I am an advocate of early marriages," said
my mother.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Miss Crab (<i>&aelig;tat</i>. 56), drawing 
a sigh as long as the thread with which she
was working.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

<p>"And who may this paragon of perfection
be?" said I.</p>

<p>"A neighbour of ours," said my mother;
"there are two sisters, both delightful persons;
but Fanny&mdash;is to <i>me</i> quite charming."</p>

<p>"We must not say too much about them,"
said Miss Crab, "or Gilbert will be disappointed; 
nor will we tell him which is Fanny,
and which her sister&mdash;he shall judge for himself.
All we have to observe Mr. Gilbert," continued
Miss Crab, "is that they have fifty thousand
pounds apiece."</p>

<p>"Equal then in <i>that</i> respect," said I; "and
when shall I see these fair creatures?"</p>

<p>"They are coming to me, to-morrow," said
my mother; "so that you will not have long to
wait before you may gratify your curiosity."</p>

<p>"And what may their name be?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"The name is not euphonic," answered my
mother.</p>

<p>"The stronger the reason for changing it,"
said I.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

<p>"Try that scheme," said my anxious parent;
"at present they rejoice in the monosyllabic
patronymic of Dod."</p>

<p>"Dod!" exclaimed I.</p>

<p>"Dod," said my mother.</p>

<p>"Dod," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"What," said I, "daughters of Sir Timothy
Dod, of Twickenham?"</p>

<p>"The same," said Mrs. Gurney; "do you
know them?"</p>

<p>What was I to say? I did know them, and I did
not know them&mdash;I had sat between them an hour
before&mdash;drank wine with them&mdash;shaken hands
with one of them&mdash;but under what circumstances? 
I felt justified in saying "No." It was truth
to a certain extent, and if I had attempted to
give the entire truth, and nothing but the truth,
it would have involved me in the confession of
an adventure, of which, though, I had escaped
with a whole skin, I was by no means proud.</p>

<p>"They live," said my mother, "in that large
house on the banks of the river, with the fine
conservatory."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 148 -->

<p>Yes, thought I, <i>that</i> conservatory which is to
come down, to make room for a branch of the
Paddington Canal.</p>

<p>"Lady Dod is a great botanist," continued my
dear unconscious mother; "and Fanny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is a great beauty," interrupted Miss Crab;
"a <i>leetel</i> on one side I think, but that's not to
be wondered at; I remember hearing Sir
Everard Home say that nine women out of ten
were more or less so."</p>

<p>"Well," said my mother, "let Gilbert judge
for himself; Fanny seems to me to be the most
likeable and loveable person I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Is Fanny the one with the beautiful hair?"
said I, like a fool.</p>

<p>"Yes," said my mother.</p>

<p>"Why, la," said Miss Crab, laying down her
work, and looking me full in the face over the
candle; "how do <i>you</i> know anything about her
beautiful hair, if you know nothing of the girls?"</p>

<p>"Me," said I; "why you talked about her
beautiful hair yourself;" not that she had, but
luckily for me, the confident manner in which I

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

made the assertion, induced her to believe she
had, and she was for the moment satisfied.</p>

<p>To me this affair was in the highest degree
perplexing. The girls were charming&mdash;the
opportunity of making their acquaintance favourable 
and inviting. Although my heart
even then was, perhaps, not mine to give, and
love altogether out of the question, still, their
society would have made the shades of Teddington, 
Elysium; and here was I, driven by
the rash imprudence of my slight acquaintance,
Daly, to fly them, to shun them, and to decamp
on their approach, not only to the detriment of
my own happiness, but to the vexation of my
anxious parent, whose whole heart was ardently
set upon making a <i>partie</i>, and who would attribute 
my flight from the maternal roof to a
distaste for the pleasing calm of retirement, or
to an addiction to grosser pleasures and less
refined pursuits; and yet, what was to be done?
the moment they saw me they would of course
recognize in the son of their much-respected
neighbour the obsequious Higgins, measuring

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

clerk to the deputy assistant surveyor of the
Paddington Canal Company. If our expedition
and invasion of Sir Timothy's lawn and house
had ended civilly, I should have had little
scruple in admitting the joke, deprecating the
anger of the young ladies, and trusting to their
love of fun for pardon; but as the catastrophe
was any thing but agreeable to their venerable
papa, and as that worthy gentleman had fallen
under the lash of Mr. Daly's practical satire, I
did not see the possibility of patching up anything 
like peace. The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> was not to
be risked; I therefore, contented myself with
listening to the praises of the beautiful sisters,
and expressing the great pleasure I should have
in making their acquaintance, at the same time,
resolving in my own mind to be up with the
lark, and in London to breakfast.</p>

<p>In those days of ingenuousness, I was not
able, even though I might have wished it,
to conceal the real feelings by which I was
affected, although, as in this instance, their
workings might be frequently misinterpreted.

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

My mother exchanged a look with Miss Crab
which I perfectly understood: it conveyed to
me at once the certainty that my excellent
parent was satisfied that something was wrong;
and as by the perpetual counsellings of her
companion, she had made up her mind
that I was going in a hand-canter&mdash;or perhaps,
I should rather say by the <i>stage</i>&mdash;on the
road to ruin, it was evident that the dear
soul attributed to some prior engagement the
cold and uncomfortable manner in which I
responded to the beautiful inspirations about a
lovely girl and fifty thousand pounds. Little
did they think what my real feelings were&mdash;how
much shame I felt at Daly's pranks, and what
regret I experienced that I could not venture to
meet the two dear victims of his most unjustifiable 
frolic. However, my miseries were only
beginning; for just as I had listened my companions 
into a calm, and heard a detail of all
the perfections of the two Miss Dods, in walked
the footman, and going up to my mother, said,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

<p>"Miss Marshall's compliments, Ma'am, she
has sent you the newspaper;" at the same moment 
placing in her hands the "Morning Post"
of the day.</p>

<p>My mother made her acknowledgments, and
I endeavoured to avail myself of the opportunity
of being very civil and offered to read it to her.
I saw it was not the paper I had seen in the
morning, and anticipated some more dreadful
criticisms upon my unhappy farce&mdash;but no&mdash;my
mother declared that she could not endure to
hear the newspaper read, and that she would look
at it herself; saying which, she forthwith proceeded 
to read the births, deaths, and marriages,
and one or two advertisements about bonnets and
caps, and then, having turned with cordial and
candid disgust from some long article upon the
state of affairs in general, she threw the popular
journal upon the table, and resumed her work.</p>

<p>Miss Crab&mdash;always active&mdash;immediately took
it up, and began in an audible voice to do that
which my respected parent had just declared

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

she disliked so much, and doled out, with a sort
of melancholy twang, sundry pieces of much
important intelligence: <i>e. g.</i></p>

<p>"Captain and Mrs. Hobkirk arrived on
Tuesday at the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly, from
Cheltenham.</p>

<p>"We understand that Sir Robert Hitchcock
is expected next Tuesday at his house in Curzon-street. 
May-fair.</p>

<p>"We are requested to contradict the report
of Miss Hall's approaching marriage with Mr.
Wetherspoon. It originated in the malicious
contrivance of a person who will not long remain
concealed.</p>

<p>"The wind in Hyde Park yesterday was
uncommonly high; the equestrians, however,
mustered strongly. Amongst the most striking
equipages we noticed the new carriage of Lady
Ann Stiffkey, built by Chamberlain and Co.,
Liquorpond-street, Gray's Inn-lane.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Huffy Buggins entertained a select
party at dinner yesterday, at her house in Portman-square; 
among the company we noticed

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

Lord Daudle, the Right Honourable John
Gumdum and Mrs. Gumdum, Sir Anthony
Bumpus and Lady, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Hogg,
and Mr. Dilbury Maggenton.</p>

<p>"Pink is the prevailing colour for the season; 
we observed in Kensington Gardens last
Sunday a bonnet peculiarly becoming; it did
not require a second glance to know that it was
of the <i>fabrique</i> of Madame Boss Tickner, of

</div>

<p>All these witticisms, and truisms, and follies,
and platitudes, I patiently bore; they fell upon

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

my tympanum, from Miss Crab's lips, as might
the sound of wind down the chimney, for I was
completely absorbed in the regret I felt at the
absolute necessity which existed for my avoiding 
the girls, with whom an acquaintance would
have been so particularly agreeable; but my
abstraction was very speedily ended, and my
heart set beating, by hearing Miss Crab, in a
somewhat louder tone than usual, twang out the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Theatre</span>.</p>

<p>"Last night afforded us the opportunity of
witnessing the justly-merited condemnation of
one of the most contemptible attempts at a
farce, with which the manager of a play-house
ever ventured to insult the public. From the
moment the curtain rose, until it fell amidst the
yells of a disgusted audience, we could not detect
one line or word calculated to moderate the
disapprobation with which the thing was received. 
The incidents&mdash;if incidents they may
be called&mdash;are stolen from the French, and the

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

dialogue from the oldest editions of Joe Miller.
It was, indeed, painful to see good actors and
actresses doomed to repeat such absurdities.
The audience were wonderfully patient, but
everything in this world must wear out; and
accordingly the second act proving, if possible,
worse than the first, forbearance was at an end,
and the whole house rose to hoot the nuisance
from the stage.</p>

<p>"This most beautiful example of modern
authorship is, we are told, from the pen of a
young gentleman of the name of Gurney, a law-student. 
If he should ever come to be a judge,
it must be of something else than literature; for,
without one redeeming point, his farce combined
dullness, indelicacy, ignorance of society, a total
want of knowledge of character, and what may,
perhaps, be worse in the present state of the
drama, entire ignorance of the peculiar qualities
of the actors. We trust that the dunce will
drive his quill in some other direction than that
of the stage, and that we shall never again be
kept from a comfortable party at home, to witness 

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

the representation of a second effort from
the same quarter."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Miss Crab?" said my
mother. "Mr. Gurney, a law-student&mdash;you
are joking?"</p>

<p>"I never joke, Ma'am," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"Now, Gilbert, explain," said my parent,
with highly erected eyebrows, "are <i>you</i> the
person meant in this odious newspaper&mdash;have
you really disgraced yourself by putting into
execution the crude and absurd ideas you admitted 
you had formed of writing a farce&mdash;tell
me&mdash;without evasion or equivocation?"</p>

<p>I saw that the blood of the Gatakers had
mounted to her cheeks, and recollecting the
precautionary letter she had written me on the
subject, I felt that I wished Miss Marshall at
Jericho for sending in the newspaper, Miss Crab
at Botany Bay for having read it, and myself
anywhere but where I was.</p>

<p>"My dear mother," said I, "when you were
good enough to express your opinions upon the
subject of my dramatic authorship, I made no

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

promise&mdash;I was guilty of no evasion or equivocation. 
I told you <i>then</i> that, let me take what
course I might, I never would do anything to
disgrace myself or my family."</p>

<p>"And how have you kept that promise?" exclaimed 
my mother; "by directly flying in the
face of my wishes and entreaties, and bringing
out a farce at the summer theatre, which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Has been damned Ma'am," exclaimed
Miss Crab, with a force and energy which made
me feel that if she were to experience a similar
fate I should not very much care.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," rejoined my mother; "if it
had succeeded&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The fault," interrupted I, "would have
been just the same."</p>

<p>"As far as regards your disobedience to me,"
said my mother;&mdash;"Yes,&mdash;as far as regards your
own reputation&mdash;No."</p>

<p>"To be sure not," chimed in Miss Crab,
pursing herself up and chuckling and turning
her head round first one way and then another.</p>

<p>"And then"&mdash;exclaimed my distressed parent.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

<p>"I know what you are going to say Mrs.
Gurney," screamed her dear companion.</p>

<p>"One at a time," cried I, and the noise
at <i>this</i> time was prodigious; both ladies had
opened on me at once, which aroused the two
little dogs on the carpet, who began barking,
upon which the three cock canary birds immediately 
began singing with all their might and
main. "One would think that I had committed
some heinous offence;" bawled I, at the top of
my voice, "I have only done what hundreds of
gentlemen have done before me; and as for
the failure, that cannot be helped&mdash;many a
better farce has been cut short in its career in
a similar manner&mdash;nipped in the bud."</p>

<p>"Only to burst out again next spring, I
fear," said Mrs. Gurney.</p>

<p>"You may be sure of <i>that</i>, Ma'am," said
Miss Crab; "once the propensity gets hold of
a man, his pen never keeps still&mdash;scribble&mdash;scribble&mdash;scribble."</p>

<p>"There you are mistaken," said I. "I have
committed a fault&mdash;that I admit; but it is not

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

ever likely to be repeated. If I had met with
the success the absence of which you so much
regret, I might have been tempted to try again;
but the first round of the ladder to fame having
snapped under my feet, I shall give it up, and
turn to something else."</p>

<p>"Fame, indeed!" said my mother; "the idea
of the fame of a farce-writer&mdash;while, with common 
application, the Bench or the Woolsack is
open to you&mdash;the notion of wasting your time
in composing folly for fools to repeat, for the
amusement of fools greater than themselves."</p>

<p>"Upon this occasion, Ma'am," said Miss
Crab, with a diabolical smile of self-satisfaction,
"the audience were not such great fools as to
listen."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Miss Crab," said I, "you are
adding pepper to the seasoning of the newspaper 
critic. I tell you all preachings and
lectures are useless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I truly believe," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"For this reason, that I am as firmly resolved
never to attempt another dramatic work, as I am

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

not to study the law, for which I have neither
turn nor ability, and my devotion to which
would be a much more ridiculous farce in real
life, than that of the mimic world which was last
night so unceremoniously driven from the stage."</p>

<p>"I see how it is," said my respected parent,
"you want to break my heart."</p>

<p>"My dear mother!" said I.</p>

<p>"No matter," said my mother, "I shall not
be here to trouble you long: surely the little
time I have to live, I might see you pursuing
a career, the termination of which might render
you happy and honourable!"</p>

<p>"I thought, my dear mother," said I, "that
let what might happen to either of us, you had
so far reconciled yourself to losing <i>me</i>, that you
were actually waiting only to learn a little more
of my brother Cuthbert's plans, to ship me off
to Calcutta."</p>

<p>"Ship you off, my child," said my mother,
whose earnestness for my respectability, and my
preservation from all the evils of dissipation
into which she feared my present pursuits and

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

connexions would lead me, induced her to
propose what she sincerely felt to be a great
sacrifice; "you do me an injustice by using
such an expression. I would rather do anything 
than part with you."</p>

<p>"Rely upon it," said Miss Crab, "it is the
best thing you <i>can</i> do&mdash;save him from
destruction, and make him a rich man into the
bargain."</p>

<p>"And lose his society for ever," said my
kind parent.</p>

<p>"You have not much of it as it is, Ma'am, I
think," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"While my mother is so happy to have <i>you</i>
as a companion," said I, "<i>my</i> presence can be
little needed here; indeed," continued I, "it
seems to me as if my appearance under this roof
was the signal for discord and confusion. I am
perfectly content to hear the advice, and even
bear the reproaches of a parent when I merit
them, but I really do not see what right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come, dear Gilbert," said my mother,
"do not speak angrily&mdash;we all mean for the best."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

<p>"Yes, I'm sure <i>I</i> do," said Miss Crab; "but
advice to young folks who <i>will</i> have their own
way is not always agreeable&mdash;medicine, however 
salutary, is seldom palatable."</p>

<p>"What I mean to say then, is this," said I:
"I have no turn for the law&mdash;I know it would
be folly in me to attempt it&mdash;I am quite satisfied 
to live upon my allowance&mdash;I owe no debts&mdash;I 
am not likely to incur any&mdash;but if my
mother is of opinion that a life of idle independence 
is not desirable, then, I repeat, I am
ready to start whenever she pleases to my
brother, according to her desire."</p>

<p>"Having previously prepared yourself in a
mercantile house in the city," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>I confess I had a great mind to quarrel with
the matured virgin for her constant interference
in my schemes and arrangements, not only
because I was really irritated at what appeared
to me to be her vast presumption on my mother's
kindness, but because it was absolutely necessary 
I should somehow "get up" a grievance in
the course of the evening, upon the strength of

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

which I might retire in dudgeon early in the
morning, so as to avoid the presence of the two
fair Dods, whom, of all girls in the world, my
anxious mother most particularly wished me to
meet.</p>

<p>I was a good deal worried about this little
<i>contretemps</i>, which went a great way to impress
upon my mind the truth of the saying, which
since has become indelibly stamped there, that
"wrong never comes right." As I have already
said, the foolish trick in which I had been involved 
that evening had rendered it impossible
for me to look the gentle victims of our hoax in
the face, or permit them to look in mine. I was
quite sure my absence would be attributed by my
parent&mdash;if not in the first instance, certainly at
the suggestion of her most unamiable companion&mdash;to 
a resolute opposition to her wishes,
and, in all probability, to the existence of some
<i>tendresse</i> in another quarter, or some clandestine
connexion of a less respectable character; but
what could I do? I asked myself this question
once or twice during what the sailors call a

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

"lull" in the storm of discussion, and I should
have been glad either to have answered it satisfactorily, 
or to have found it the only one I had
to put; unluckily, there was another which cut
me even deeper than the first. How came I
involved in the surveying affair?&mdash;by an association 
with one of those agreeable <i>vauriens</i> of
whom my excellent parent had such a violent,
and, as I used to think, needless dread.</p>

<p>Here, however, in this one instance, I could
neither impugn nor gainsay her apprehensions.
If I had not written the farce I should not have
known the actors,&mdash;if I had not known the actors
I could not have joined them at Richmond,&mdash;if
I had not joined them at Richmond I should not
have made the acquaintance of Mr. Daly,&mdash;and
if I had not have made his acquaintance I should
have ridden quietly home to my mother's cottage, 
have enjoyed her society without rebuke
or reproach, and the next morning have been
presented to two lovely and amiable young
women, with one of whom, even situated as I

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

was, I might have formed, at some future period,
a happy and honourable alliance.</p>

<p>"After all," thought I, "my mother is right;"
but, as if Old Nick had set his hoof in it, it was
the only occasion I could recollect upon which I
was unable to admit her to be so; and thus,
adding hypocrisy to undutifulness, I combated
her arguments, which, in fact, convinced me;
opposed suggestions which I was satisfied were
admirable, and closed an uncomfortable evening
by going to bed in an unamiable fit of assumed
anger.</p>

<p>After I had retired to my room I heard the
two ladies holding converse rather long than
gentle. It struck me that my mother was taking 
my part against the vindictive malignity of
her ill-conditioned friend, whose anxious desire
for my departure for India I was base enough to
attribute to a desire on her part to get entire
possession of my excellent mother during her
life, and of her property after her death; and
more than once I had resolved to open my heart

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

to my mother and communicate my thoughts and
suspicions. However, for the present, the "evil
of the day" was sufficient to encounter, and the
only question which remained unsettled in my
mind was whether I should get away as I first
proposed to myself before breakfast, or breakfast 
with the ladies, pretend an engagement in
town, and so depart about eleven.</p>

<p>Upon mature deliberation, I determined upon
an early flight: there could then be no remonstrances, 
no explanations, no pressings or insistings,&mdash;no 
demurrings, or evasions. I therefore
wrote a note before I went to bed, and ordered
my servant to have the horses at the stable gate
by eight o'clock. The note too was unworthy
of me. I pleaded the unpleasantness of useless
discussions at the cause of my sudden departure,
and expressed a perfect readiness to return and
accommodate myself to my mother's wishes
whenever she was prepared to receive me with
less harshness than she had exhibited that evening. 
Thus evil upon evil seemed to accumulate.
It would vex her gentle nature to think she had

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

wounded my feelings, and she would worry herself 
at my absence. Yet without some cause I
could not have gone; and thus, as one falsehood
invariably begets another, one meanness produced 
more, and I condescended to sneak out
of my mother's house under false pretences, in
order to avoid being detected in an unwarrantable 
proceeding, contrived and carried into effect
by one of my new theatrical connexions.</p>

<p>I did not feel satisfied with these results, and
I think I slept worse than I otherwise should,
considering that I had undergone much fatigue,
mental and bodily, during the day, and that I
had scarcely closed my eyes the night before,
while my heart was full of the martyrdom of my
favourite Sir Jeffery. I arose stealthily and
noiselessly before my note could be conveyed
to my mother's room by her maid, and by half-past 
eight found myself journeying back to
town, less composed, and more unsettled than I
ever recollected to have been before.</p>

<p>For a narrative of the events which occurred
after my departure I am indebted to a letter

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

from my excellent parent, upon whose mind
they were impressed with an almost indelible
severity: a letter which, as will hereafter be seen,
was rendered by circumstances deeply and painfully 
interesting.</p>

<p>Breakfast ready, and Miss Crab waiting;
down came my mother with my note in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Miss Crab. "I was
down before you, waiting to take a turn round
the shrubbery with Gilbert, and prepare his
mind for the beauties he is to see at luncheon."</p>

<p>"You would have lost your labour had you
waited till luncheon-time itself," said my mother.
"Gilbert is gone to town."</p>

<p>"To town!" exclaimed Miss Crab. "Umph!
That is strange. What reason does he give for
running away from the treat we have proposed
for him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Gurney, "that he
is altogether wrong in his feelings; but I am
quite sure I know what those feelings are. He

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

thinks that whatever right <i>I</i> may have to question 
and even censure his conduct when I think
it faulty, a second person&mdash;not a relation, and
having, no legitimate control over him&mdash;has
<i>none;</i>&mdash;in fact, my belief is, that he is worried
and vexed by your interference."</p>

<p>"Mine, Ma'am!" said Miss Crab; "really
I did not expect this. You have been most
candid and confidential in all your communications 
about your son to me; and I thought, after
the observations you had made, that I was supporting 
you in your endeavours to keep him
right, at your own special desire."</p>

<p>"I do not, in the slightest degree," said my
mother, "impugn your intentions or doubt your
anxiety, Miss Crab; but <i>he</i> feels that your support 
generally has the effect of heightening
whatever fault of his is under discussion, and of
urging me to a severity which he does not believe 
to be natural to my character."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, Ma'am," said Miss Crab, "I
have done. Let him follow his own inclinations,&mdash;let 

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

him go upon the stage or upon the
highway, which, in my mind, is little worse;&mdash;rely 
upon it, Ma'am, I will never say another
syllable."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Crab," said my mother, who
was, with respect to our quarrels, something
like what a wife is to a husband,&mdash;she did not
care how much she scolded me herself, but was
very tetchy if any third person attempted to
assail me&mdash;"My dear Miss Crab, what extraordinary 
ideas, and how strangely expressed!
Gilbert is wild and thoughtless, and idle, and
giddy, and, unfortunately, addicted to pursuits
which perhaps may be unprofitable, but certainly
not dishonourable. He dislikes the law, and
shrinks from trade."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure he does!" said Miss Crab;
"and of course it is all quite right. If I had
known what his determinations were, and how
he was to be upheld in them, I certainly
should not have made a very considerable
effort to speak to Mr. Yellowly, of the firm of
Curry, Raikes, Yellowly, Lefevre, and Co.,

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

in his behalf. Now, that I understand how
my advice and suggestions are received, I
shall venture them no longer. As for this
morning, my belief is, that his reason for going
away is the coming hither of the two Miss
Dods: rely upon it, living as he is, and has been
for some time past, he has formed some <i>liaison</i>,
which, if it does not definitively prevent his
forming a respectable matrimonial connexion,
gives him, at least for the present, a distaste for
any other society. I saw his restlessness and
agitation the moment you mentioned that your
young and virtuous visitors were expected."</p>

<p>"We must not be too fastidious: no, nor too
inquisitive," said my mother. "Recollect that
our conversation about our fair neighbours and
the probability of the results of this interview
were jokes;&mdash;that nothing upon earth could be
much more improbable than that a casual visit
here should lead to an union between one of the
young ladies and my son."</p>

<p>"Improbable!" said Miss Crab, "nothing
<i>more</i> probable! Everything must have a beginning, 

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

and <i>my</i> creed is, that young ladies who
are over-fastidious are not over-wise."</p>

<p>This was what Daly would have called a
"bad shot," for either Miss Crab had, by her
own showing, been extremely unwise, or had
never been asked. My mother perceived the
slip, but was too amiable and too well-bred to
take advantage of it.</p>

<p>"What I mean to say, my dear Miss Crab,"
said my mother, "is, that in spite of all the follies
and indiscretions of which Gilbert, at twenty
years of age, may be guilty, I am quite sure
that he would neither sacrifice himself in a
mercenary marriage, nor form an acquaintance
or connexion likely to turn out disgracefully."</p>

<p>"Well, Ma'am," said Miss Crab, "enjoy
your own opinion. I know the difficulty of
persuading parents upon particular points; however, 
you may rely upon it that your son's
absence this morning is not owing to anything
that I have either said or done to annoy him&mdash;time, 
perhaps, will show who is right."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

<p>"I am content to let it rest there," said my
mother; and having thus made peace, she proceeded 
to make tea, not, however, without an
observation from Miss Crab as to the water
being quite cold in consequence of having stood
so long upon the table, the flame under the
urn having been, in consequence of the carelessness 
of the servant, out for the last ten minutes.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Crab, let the subject be what it
might, always contrived to drop her little contribution 
of acid into the cup; and yet my mother
had become so used to her, and so convinced&mdash;which 
I was not&mdash;of her disinterested attachment 
to her, that although, when I was the
object of her varying attacks, she would rally all
her energies in my defence, I really believe she
liked the excitement produced by her friend's
perpetual and unvarying fault-finding.</p>

<p>The breakfast went on as usual; there was of
course a little too much cream, and much too
little sugar, in Miss Crab's tea; and the butter
was extremely bad for the time of year, when

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

there was plenty of grass for the cows to eat,&mdash;and 
the raspberries were not ripe,&mdash;and the eggs
were not so fresh as they might have been,&mdash;and
so, in all other matters, something was wrong.
Yet time and patience conquered these little ills,
and a stroll in the grounds, succeeded by writing
little notes and doing a little "work," brought
the domesticated couple to within half an hour
of the time at which luncheon would be served,
and the Misses Dod arrive to partake of it.</p>

<p>At this juncture a smartish ringing at the
gate-bell aroused the attention of the ladies,
who began putting their faces into the most
amiable shape, expecting their sylph-like visitors; 
but they were somewhat disappointed, and
perhaps more surprised, when the servant, throwing 
open the door, announced "Mr. Daly."</p>

<p>"Mr. Daly!" said my mother. "Who?"</p>

<p>"Daly!" said Miss Crab. "What?"</p>

<p>"A friend of Mr. Gilbert's, Ma'am," said the
servant.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said my excellent parent; "pray
desire Mr. Daly to walk in."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

<p>The invitation was superfluous, for he had
"followed the heels" of the footman so closely,
as to be actually in the room before it was completed.</p>

<p>"I beg ten thousand pardons, Ma'am," said
Daly; "I believe I have the honour of addressing 
the mother of my friend Gilbert?" He hit
<i>that</i> off, happily, by a glance at the mystic badge
which my amiable parent exhibited on the third
finger of her left hand.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am intruding upon your
delightful seclusion, but knowing that our dear
Gilbert was here last night, it occurred to me
that in all probability he would also be here this
morning; so, as I am domesticated at Hampton
Court, I did hope to persuade him to come over
and take a cutlet with me, and meet two or
three of the 18th, who, as of course you know,
are quartered there."</p>

<p>"My son," said Mrs. Gurney, "<i>was</i> here
last night, but went unexpectedly to town this
morning before breakfast."</p>

<p>"What a delightful person he is, Ma'am!"

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

said Daly; "so full of kindness and ingenuousness, 
and so clever! The worst of these geniuses 
is, they seldom have any application&mdash;sorry
about his farce, poor fellow&mdash;however, he does
not seem to take it much to heart&mdash;met him
yesterday at Richmond&mdash;pleasant day&mdash;pleasant
place&mdash;pleasant people&mdash;do you visit much at
Hampton Court, Ma'am?"</p>

<p>My mother, who was perfectly astounded at
the ease and volubility of my "slight acquaintance,"&mdash;said 
"that her visiting-list was a very
small one, and that she rarely ventured so far."</p>

<p>"I find it uncommon pleasant," said Daly,
"because the 18th are there&mdash;deuced fine fellows, 
you know, and all that&mdash;else it seems
dullish. I confess I like having all the parties
of Palace people under the same roof&mdash;the long
passages and the steep staircases&mdash;not to speak
of ringing Lady Niddynod's bell, and stuffing
a cork into the jet of the fountain&mdash;and then
to see the Cockneys come to look at the
Cartoons, and then to watch them at the Toy&mdash;capital 
fun I have there sometimes, Ma'am,&mdash;locking 

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

a whole family of fowls into a
bed-room cupboard&mdash;the sleeping sight-seers
tumble into their beds, and all is hushed and
calm as my own conscience&mdash;just about daylight, 
Ma'am, the cock in the closet begins to
crow, which sets Mrs. Cock, and all the Miss
Cockses into a charm of cackling, which the
affrighted innocents from Finsbury-square or
St. Mary Axe are as unable to account for as
to check; and so from daylight, till they can
rouse the servants to their assistance, the inhabitants 
of the hen-roost, like so many minor
Macbeths, 'murder sleep.' I call that very
good fun, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"Mischief <i>I</i> call it," said Miss Crab. "And
pray, Sir, does Mr. Gilbert Gurney participate
in such amusements as these?"</p>

<p>"I never tell tales out of school," said Daly.
"For myself, I confess I love fun; and only the
night before last, being considerably annoyed
by a loud snoring in the next room, proceeded
to see who was the monster that caused it;
there I found a venerable lady, who incautiously 

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

slept with her door unfastened, snoring
away&mdash;'discoursing,' as Shakspeare has it&mdash;most 
discordant music with her nose. What
d'ye think I did, Ma'am? Ran to my room,
burnt the cork of an Eau de Cologne bottle in
the candle, returned to the apartment of the
sleeping hyena, and gave her a pair of coal-black
mustachios, which, when she presented her grim
visage to her daughter, who came the first thing
in the morning to beg her blessing, threw the
young lady into a fit of convulsions, which took
Griffinhoof of Hampton three hours and a half
to get rid of&mdash;that's fun, or the deuce is in it."

<p>"And is it," said my mother&mdash;who sat petrified
at the indomitable manner of the wag&mdash;"is it to
enjoy such jokes as these that you wish my son
to join you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by no means," said Daly; "I never
involve a friend&mdash;never&mdash;if I can possibly help
it&mdash;no, I should like to introduce him to the
18th; and then there are Lord and Lady Griggs,
and the Miss Cranbournes, and dear Lady Venerable, 
the charming Miss Fizzgiggle, and her

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

very agreeable mother. The delightful Lady
Katharine Mango, and her very charming
daughter, and the best of all excellent men,
a kind-hearted, hospitable East India Captain,
the very double of the Lord Chancellor, who
has got a pet bird fifteen feet high, with legs
like stilts, and a body like a goose. I promise
you I will skim the cream of the Court for Gilbert 
if he will but come&mdash;canter to Kingston&mdash;migrate 
to Molesy&mdash;saunter to Sunbury&mdash;drop 
in at Ditton&mdash;make him acquainted with
all the news of the neighbourhood, and place
him only second to myself in the estimation of
our enlightened and select circle of society."</p>

<p>It must have been a curious sight to see
Daly running on in this free and easy manner, 
and the two ladies sitting, one beside and
the other opposite to him, perfectly thunderstruck 
by his proceedings, and evidently uncertain 
what he would next say or do.</p>

<p>"I like Hampton Court, Ma'am," continued
Daly, without paying the least attention to the
astonished countenances of his companions; "it's

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

such a nice distance from town&mdash;out of the smoke,
and among nice people&mdash;Toy, bad inn&mdash;landlord
<i>smart;</i>&mdash;servants not&mdash;only one waiter, and he
a Goth&mdash;I had three friends to dine with me on
Tuesday, and what d'ye think happened, Ma'am?
If you recollect, it was vastly hot on Tuesday&mdash;glass 
82° in the shade&mdash;asked if there was any
ice&mdash;not an ounce in the house&mdash;where was the
waiter&mdash;only conceive, Ma'am, the singularity
of the sound, '<i>the</i> waiter,' in an inn half as
big as a county hospital&mdash;Lawrence was gone
to Chertsey&mdash;I had no resource&mdash;could not wait
till he came back&mdash;wanted to cool my wine&mdash;ordered 
the maid to get a pail of pump-water,
put it in the shade on the leads at the back of
the house, and pop into it two bottles of Grave,
two of Hock, and two of Champagne&mdash;what
d'ye think occurred, Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," said Miss Crab, who was
at last absolutely provoked into conversation.
"Most likely the girl forgot it."</p>

<p>"Not she, Ma'am," said Daly; "I'm sure
I wish she had. No; she did as she was

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

bid most punctually. Dinner-time came; soup
served. My friends, Tootle, Bootle, and Sims
of the 18th, all seated. I turned to Lawrence,
who had just returned from Chertsey, and was
standing at the back of my chair, 'Get a bottle
of Hock and a bottle of Grave,' said I."</p>

<p>" 'Where are they, Sir?' said he.</p>

<p>" 'Oh,' said I, 'you'll find them cooling in
a pail of water, in a shady draught of air on the
leads.'</p>

<p>" 'Very well, Sir,' says he, and away he goes,
and quickly enough he comes back. 'Pretty job,
Sir,' says Lawrence, with a face like the ghost
of Gaffer Thumb&mdash;' Who did <i>this</i> for you, Sir?'</p>

<p>" 'What?' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Put the Grave and the Hock to cool.'</p>

<p>" 'Who?' said I. 'Why, Fanny Lanshawe,
the chambermaid.'</p>

<p>" 'Fanny be&mdash;&mdash;!' You'll excuse my not repeating 
what he said, Ma'am.&mdash;'She has served
you a nice trick, Sir. Look here.' And sure
enough, Ma'am, suiting the action to the word,
in he brings the pail, into which the simple

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

creature had emptied the six bottles of enlivening 
liquor, and exhibits, to our utter amazement 
and confusion, three gallons and a half of
very weak mixed wine-and-water. These <i>are</i>
drawbacks, Ma'am, you'll admit; but there
must be alloys to everything. For <i>my</i> part,
nothing damps me&mdash;nothing shakes me; I go
on laughing along my flowery course, and care
for nothing upon earth."</p>

<p>At this moment, in which Daly was boasting
of his imperturbable serenity and joyousness,
the drawing-room door was again flung open, the
servant announced, in an audible voice&mdash;"Miss
Dod, and Miss Fanny Dod;" and there, before
Daly's astonished eyes, stood, in all their native
loveliness arrayed, the two accomplished daughters 
of his last night's victim. They approached,
but started back for an instant on recognising
their persecutor of the preceding evening so
snugly and comfortably domesticated with their
new acquaintance at the cottage. The ladies
rose to receive their guests, and were just
shaking hands, when Daly in a tone of exquisite 

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

torture, exclaimed, "Oh my nose!&mdash;my
nose!" and instantly enveloped his whole countenance 
in a full-sized silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed my mother, "what is
the matter, Sir?"</p>

<p>"A trifle, Ma'am," said Daly, with his face
buried in the bandana. "A trifle light as air:
it's only my nose, Ma'am&mdash;subject to periodical 
fits of bleeding&mdash;after a dreadful fall over
a five-barred gate, near Grantham. Don't mind
<i>me</i>, Ma'am. I'll run away; perhaps it mayn't
stop for a fortnight. I won't worry <i>you</i> any
longer&mdash;I'm off&mdash;I'll plunge my head into the
river. Just remember me to Gilbert; say I
called; and&mdash;O dear, dear&mdash;how unlucky! Adieu&mdash;good 
morning:" saying which, without removing 
the handkerchief, he bustled out and
hurried from the room. Mrs. Gurney, to say
truth, was not very sorry to perform the office of
ringing the bell, in order that he might have
free egress from her peaceful home.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary man!" said my
mother.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

<p>"Is he mad?" said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"Do you know him well?" said Fanny
Dod.</p>

<p>"No; he is an intimate friend of my son's,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" interrupted Miss Dod.</p>

<p>"Why," said my mother, "do <i>you</i> know anything 
of him. Miss Dod?"</p>

<p>"No good, I am sure," said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"Why," said Fanny, "we know no great
harm of him; only he came to our house last
night with his clerk&mdash;a much better-behaved
person than himself&mdash;and frightened us all out
of our wits, by threatening to pull down mamma's 
dear conservatory."</p>

<p>"Pull down a conservatory!" said my mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, officially," said Miss Dod.</p>

<p>"Why, what is he?" said my mother.</p>

<p>"A painter and glazier, Ma'am, I dare say,"
said Miss Crab.</p>

<p>"No," continued Miss Dod. "You of
course know who he is."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

"Not I," said my mother. "He said he was
an intimate friend of my son's, and came to invite 
him to meet some of the 18th at Hampton
Court at dinner to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Crab; "Tootle, Bootle,
and Sims were their names."</p>

<p>"There <i>are</i> such men in the 18th," said
Fanny Dod. "The ourang-outang's name is
Tootle, Gussy, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Augusta; "but I cannot believe
that this man can be giving dinners to officers
of the 18th."</p>

<p>"Why, who and what upon earth is he?"
said my mother, getting very anxious to know
what her Gilbert's great crony really was.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Fanny, "there's no harm in him
that we know of; only he was very rude to
papa, at last. He came measuring our lawn,
in order to ascertain the shortest cut for a canal
to Brentford."</p>

<p>"And," said Augusta, "we behaved as well
as possible both to him and his clerk; and yet he
vowed vengeance on the corner of the conservatory, 

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

and threatened to bring the barge-road
close under our bedroom windows."</p>

<p>"Still, you don't say how he could do this,
Miss Dod," said my mother.</p>

<p>"Why, I believe he is the Acting Deputy
Assistant-Surveyor to the Grand Junction Canal
Company," said Augusta; "and a very forward,
presuming, rude gentleman into the bargain."</p>

<p>"And Gilbert's particular friend!" exclaimed
my mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am," said Miss Crab, in her glory;
"and yet you are quite sure that he never will
form an acquaintance or connexion likely to
turn out disgracefully."</p>

<p>Luckily at that moment luncheon was announced, 
and the party proceeded to the breakfast-parlour 
to partake of it.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied and unsettled as I felt on my way
to town, I confess if I could have looked, Asmodeus-like, 
into the peaceful residence of my
respected parent, during this and the preceding
scene&mdash;as I should have called them&mdash;my sensations 
would have been of a much more serious

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

and disagreeable character. I never anticipated
a visit from Daly at Teddington, and consoled
myself by the escape I had made from an interview 
with the ladies, whose growing intimacy
at the cottage must, I foresaw, nevertheless produce 
an explanation ere long, or act as a prohibition 
to my visits to my mother. I confess
I was perfectly astonished when I heard the
details. I had never given him the slightest
encouragement to come to the cottage, where I
must have been certain his manners, principles,
and pursuits would throw its gentle occupants
into the highest state of perturbation. My
regret when, under the most melancholy circumstances, 
I ascertained what had occurred was
serious indeed; and my resolution never again
to make acquaintances <i>extempore</i>, was coupled
with the conviction that a practical joke is, in
fact, no joke at all,&mdash;and yet, such is the influence 
of agreeable manners and lively conversation, 
that Daly subsequently became my greatest 
friend, at least in the worldly acceptation
of that most equivocal word.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that a certain place not mentionable
to "ears polite" is paved with "good intentions." 
Whether it will ever be Macadamized
(for that I believe is the term for "unstoning,"
now fast gaining ground as I am looking over
my papers, which in all probability everybody
else will overlook) I cannot pretend to say;
but certain it is, that although I was beyond
measure mortified by the results of the Twickenham 
prank, my exclusion from the society
of the Miss Dods, and my absolutely necessary
escape from an association with them; I was
very soon reconciled to my fate after the arrival

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

of Devil Daly (as I used subsequently to call
him) at my lodgings in Suffolk-street.</p>

<p>The instant he had been dislodged from the
cottage by the appearance of the young ladies
whose family he had so seriously outraged on
the previous evening, instead of walking his
horse back to Smart's, at the Toy, at Hampton
Court, he cantered up to visit me in London; not
so much from any particular affection for me,
but because, although himself the victim, there
was something so exciting and delightful to him
in a joke, that he could not deny himself the
pleasure of narrating to me the history of the
arrival of the sylphs, and his extraordinary
<i>ruse</i> of the bleeding nose. I never saw him
in higher spirits, and, <i>quoad</i> my resolutions, I
could not for the life of me refuse to join him
in a stroll about town, which, although the
season was somewhat advanced, was yet agreeably 
full, with a pledge to dine with him somewhere 
afterwards.</p>

<p>In those days clubs were scarce, although
<i>then</i> hearts were plenty; there were no clubs of

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

note at that period but White's, Brookes's, and
Boodle's. To be sure, there was the Cocoa
Tree, and there was Graham's, but the number
of members was small, the system confined,
and therefore, although Daly and I were as
proud as Lucifer, and as "fine as fine could
be," men had no resource when they wished
to enjoy the "feast of reason and the flow of
soul"&mdash;the one in the shape of a cutlet, and
the other in the tapering form of a bottle of
claret&mdash;but to repair to a coffee-house, a place
which, I find, is now (I speak while I am arranging 
my papers) obsolete&mdash;a dear nice uncomfortable 
room, with a bar opening into it, a
sanded floor, an argand lamp smoking a tin
tray in the middle of its ceiling, boxes along
its sides, with hard carpet-covered benches,
schoolboy tables, and partitions, with rods, and
rings, and curtains, like those of a church-warden's 
pew in a country church.</p>

<p>I selected Dejex's, at the corner of Leicester-place. 
Attention and civility, a good <i>cuisine</i>,
and good wine, formed its particular attractions.

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

and the courteous attention of "mine host" gave
a new zest to his cookery and his claret. I
own I love attention and civility&mdash;not <i>that</i>,
which seems to be extracted by dint of money,
or by force of the relative situations of guest
and landlord,&mdash;but that anxious desire to please&mdash;that 
consideration of one's little peculiarities&mdash;and 
that cheerfulness of greeting, which, even
if it be assumed, is always satisfactory. To
Dejex's we resolved to go, and having "secured
our box" and taken our stroll, we found ourselves 
seated and served by a little after six
o'clock.</p>

<p>There was something irresistibly, practically
engaging about Daly, and I never felt more completely 
assured of the influence over me of a man
with whom I had been so short a time acquainted,
as I was when I found myself again&mdash;in the
course of eight and forty hours&mdash;associated with
him in a place which of all others was the most
likely to afford him some opportunity of exhibiting 
his eccentricities; for the company consisted 
in a great degree of <i>emigr&eacute;s</i> of the ancient

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, who, until the Master hand of Wellington 
was raised to cut the Gordian knot of their
difficulties, which negotiation had for years
in vain attempted to untwist, England was
the asylum for that persecuted race. Yet, however 
much their misfortunes&mdash;the natural results
of anarchy and revolution&mdash;might excite our
sympathies and demand our assistance, some
of them, it must be admitted, were to our then
unaccustomed eyes extremely strange specimens 
of humanity; they were what Mr. Daly,
in his peculiar phraseology, called "uncommon
gigs;" and one very venerable <i>ci-devant</i> marquis, 
who wore spectacles, the said Daly, as
he advanced up the room, somewhat too loudly
I thought, pronounced to be "a gig with
lamps."</p>

<p>However, we got through dinner and had
safely demolished our admirable <i>omelette souffl&eacute;e</i>
without any outbreaking on the part of my
mercurial companion; the coffee-room began
to thin, and I began to be more at my ease
than before, when Daly proceeded to recount

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

some of his adventures, which proved to me
that, however deeply the scene of the preceding
day at Twickenham might have impressed itself 
on <i>me</i>, it was to <i>him</i> a "trifle light as
air."</p>

<p>"But how," said I, "shall I ever reconcile
the Dods? I am destined to meet those people;
you are not."</p>

<p>"I was destined to meet them this morning,"
replied Daly, "and if it had not been for this
'bleeding piece of earth,' " laying hold of his
nose, "I could not well have escaped; but for
you, rely upon it, it will all turn out right&mdash;in 
a week they will have utterly forgotten
you."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "will Fanny so soon lose all
recollection of me?"</p>

<p>"To be sure she will," said Daly. "As
somebody says,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Fancy's visions, like the sand,
    Every idle mark receive;
Lines are traced by every hand,
    Which no lasting impress leave.' "</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

<p>"But <i>her</i> hand," said I.</p>

<p>"You took and shook," replied he, "and
very wisely too; but recollect it was nearly
dark when we made our exit."</p>

<p>"And you insulted the father&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;who first affronted <i>me</i>," said Daly;
"and even if the girls <i>did</i> know me this morning, 
and recognise me as assistant clerk to the
deputy assistant surveyor of the Paddington
Canal Company, the deuce is in it if the
whole family must not respect me as a high-minded, 
honourable, and conscientious assistant
clerk."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was quite light enough when
we arrived," said I, "to see them and their
beauties; why not light enough for them to
see our deformities?"</p>

<p>"Deformities!" said Daly; "speak for yourself, 
Mr. Gurney; women don't care so much
for men's beauty as you may suppose. Here
am I&mdash;plain, but genteel, like a Wedgwood
teapot&mdash;I make my way, and whatever you
may think of yourself and Miss Fanny, I flatter

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

myself Gussy, as her ma' called her, was equally
well pleased with your humble servant."</p>

<p>"And yet we may never see either of them
again," said I.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," said Daly, "I
have done worse to a father than I did to Dod
in the course of my life, and yet have come
to be domesticated in the family afterwards."</p>

<p>"As how?" said I.</p>

<p>"Some three years since," said Daly, "I was
down at my friend's Sir Marmaduke Wrigglesworth's, 
in Surrey&mdash;charming place&mdash;nice wife&mdash;excellent 
shooting&mdash;capital cook&mdash;and inexhaustible 
cellars. 'Marmaduke,' said I, 'I hate
battues; here you have a party staying for the
wholesale slaughter of pheasants&mdash;eleven double
barrels all of a row&mdash;more chance of homicide
than sport; do me the kindness to let me off,
and permit me to 'range the fields' by myself,
and I will consent to be laughed at for my small
gains when the card comes in before dinner.
'Do as you like,' said Wrigglesworth: 'this is
Liberty Hall&mdash;shoot alone or in company&mdash;with

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

dogs or without&mdash;have the keeper or not&mdash;<i>comme 
il vous plaira</i>.' Accordingly away I
went, more eager for the sport as having to
render an account of my single exploits, young
enough to do my day's work well, and strong
enough to bring my day's work home. I admit
I was not quite so well pleased with what I saw,
or rather what I did not see, as I went on&mdash;birds
were scarce, wild, and shy, and I did not get a
shot for the first hour, except at a venerable
rabbit, who had retired from public life, but
who had somewhat incautiously left his tail out
of the burrow which he had selected for his
final retreat&mdash;at him I went, and he died&mdash;first
tenant of my bag."</p>

<p>"A tenant in tail," said I punning professionally.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," continued Daly, who never
stopped for anybody, "on I went until at last,
after three hours' ploughing and plodding, I fell
in with one of the nicest little snug copses you
ever set your eyes on. In I went&mdash;whurr went
the pheasants&mdash;bang went the barrels&mdash;down

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

came the birds&mdash;and by the time I had crossed
the copse, three cocks and&mdash;<i>heu mihi!</i>&mdash;two
hens graced my store."</p>

<p>"Pretty sport for the time," said I.</p>

<p>"No sooner, however," said Daly, "had I
emerged from the thicket, than I found myself
upon a sort of parkish-looking lawn, on the rise
of which stood a very respectable house, at the
door of which I could distinguish a group of
persons standing, and from the court-yard of
which I saw some sort of servant leading forth a
stout short-legged pony, with a thick neck and
a stumpy tail&mdash;evidently master's favourite&mdash;equal 
to fourteen stone, warranted never to shy,
trip, or stumble. Upon its back did I see a
portly gentleman bestride himself, and forthwith
begin to canter towards me, followed at a somewhat 
splitting pace by two keepers on foot,
each armed either with guns or sticks, which, I
could not easily distinguish."</p>

<p>"I foresee," said I.</p>

<p>"So did I," said Daly, "the moment I saw
the governor coming full tilt, I knew I had been

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

trespassing, and the moment I stepped upon
his infernal lawn, felt that I had put my foot
into it."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what happened?"</p>

<p>"Why," continued Daly, "I standing still,
and he moving somewhat rapidly, the elder of
the two had the best of it, and I was very soon
within six inches of his cob's nose, and within
about half a yard of his own. 'You are a
pretty fellow, Sir,' said the irate gentleman, 'to
come poaching and killing the birds in my
preserves, close to my house&mdash;why what the
devil are you thinking of, you rascal? Here,
Stephens&mdash;Thomson&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said I, "I am extremely sorry&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Sorry,' interrupted Mr. Bagswash&mdash;(for such
was the gentleman's name)&mdash;'sorry, yes, and
well you may be sorry; Botany Bay is too good
for a fellow like you, Sir. Lay hands on him.'</p>

<p>" 'One moment Sir,' said I; 'I am a gentleman.' 
Whereupon Squire Bagswash and his
keepers burst into an unseemly fit of laughing.</p>

<p>" 'A pretty gentleman too,' said Bagswash.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

<p>" 'I thank you, Sir,' said I, 'I don't want compliments, 
I only want a hearing. I am staying
on a visit at Sir Marmaduke Wrigglesworth's,
and here is my card.' Saying which I produced&mdash;from 
what I happened by the merest but
luckiest accident in the world to have about me,
my card-case&mdash;my visiting ticket.</p>

<p>" 'Young man,' said my opponent, having
read it, 'is this genuine?&mdash;My name, Sir, is
Bagswash; I am personally known to Sir Marmaduke.&mdash;Is 
what you are saying true?'</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said I, 'I am not accustomed to have
my word doubted. I admit, that not being
perfectly acquainted with the boundaries of the
Wrigglesworth property, I have transgressed
and trespassed. I am sorry for it; and sorry
that you should have so far forgotten yourself as
to use language which, I am quite sure in a
more temperate mood you would regret.'</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said Bagswash, half doubting, and
certainly more than half fearing me, 'I don't
know that I have used any strong expressions,
I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

<p>" 'Rascal, I think,' said I, bowing profoundly.</p>

<p>" 'If I did, I&mdash;really,' said Bagswash, 'I&mdash;might&mdash;but 
I was irritated&mdash;Sir, this is my
manor.'</p>

<p>" 'Why, Sir,' said I, 'as to your manner, I
<i>do</i> think it might have been a little more courteous&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Sir,' said my antagonist, who evidently
was anxious to justify his coarseness and vulgarity, 
'but&mdash;the manor, I mean&mdash;for I can't
pun, Sir, and I hate puns, Sir; the manor I
mean, costs me a very large sum annually&mdash;a
very large sum, indeed, Sir, to preserve; and
therefore when I see what I conceive to be a
poacher immediately under my nose, actually in
my homestead&mdash;upon my lawn, I may say&mdash;shooting 
right and left; it does put me in a
passion, and I own I was warm, and perhaps
hasty; but it <i>is</i> a provocation, and I should like
to know, under all the circumstances, what <i>you</i>
yourself would say if you were <i>me</i> at this moment?'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

<p>" 'Say, Sir!' said I, 'I haven't the smallest
hesitation about that, Sir. If I were <i>you</i> at
this moment, I should say,&mdash;'Mr. Daly, I beg
your pardon for the hasty way in which I spoke
when I thought you a poacher; and in order to
show that although passionate I am not vindictive, 
I hope as it is just luncheon-time, and you
must have walked a long way and haven't had
very good sport, that you will do me and Mrs.
Bagswash the favour to come in and take a
cutlet, or a little cold meat, as the case may be,
and make up our differences with a glass or two
of wine.'</p>

<p>" 'By Jove,' cried Bagswash, 'you are a
queer fellow&mdash;the very spit of your father,
whom I knew before I retired to these parts.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh,' whispered one of the keepers to
the other. 'Master does know him&mdash;he <i>had</i> a
father.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh,' said the other; and they both immediately 
lowered their sticks to the ground.</p>

<p>" 'And,' continued the squire, 'you have only
just anticipated me in an invitation, except that

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

I apprehended some more serious requisition on
<i>your</i> part.'</p>

<p>" 'Not a bit, Sir,' said I; 'there are a vast
many gentlemen in the world who don't look
like gentlemen, and the shooting jacket and
gaiters equalize appearances so much, that Nature 
must have done a vast deal to give a man
an aristocratic appearance under so rough a
husk&mdash;but as to any meeting, except at your
hospitable table, I have not the slightest wish
for it. In my opinion, Sir, one luncheon is
preferable to two balls.'</p>

<p>" 'Ah!' said Bagswash, 'I am glad o' that,
in spite of your pun. Run up, Stephens, and
tell them to get luncheon as soon as possible.
Mr. Daly, a friend of Sir Marmaduke Wrigglesworth, 
is coming to join our family party.' "</p>

<p>"Well, Daly," said I, "there your presence
of mind served you well."</p>

<p>"Hear the sequel," said Daly. "Encouraged 
by the acquiescence of Bagswash, as I was
yesterday by the invitation of Dod, I proceeded
towards the house, placing, ever and anon, my

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

hand on the neck of his cob, or the pummel of
the saddle, in order to mark to the distant group
the familiar nature of our acquaintance; and in
this fashion we reached the mansion, upon the
steps of which a bevy of graces, in number more
like the Muses, welcomed us. I <i>had</i> a reputation 
even then, and the moment the girls had
heard who was coming, they made up their
minds to mirth&mdash;even the big Mrs. Bagswash
rolled herself into the hall, like a fillet of veal
upon castors, to do me honour.</p>

<p>"Bating the parents," continued Daly, "I
never saw a more prepossessing family. I forget
all their names, but one was slim and sylph-like,
another plump and pleasant, a third a wicked-looking 
brunette, a fourth a demure and bashful
blonde: all I felt as I entered the house was,
that if I had brought eight friends with me, I
might, by giving each his choice, have had
some one of the 'tuneful nine' left entirely to
myself."</p>

<p>"And," said I, "were you the only man!"</p>

<p>"No," replied Daly, "there were two yahoos,

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

in white cord breeches and leather gaiters, and
a boy with a frill and a frock, upon which a
favourable eruption of brass sugar-loaf buttons
had taken place; a Dr. somebody, who turned
out to be the nearest apothecary; and a very
pale, long-legged youth, the curate of the
parish."</p>

<p>"A largish luncheon party," said I.</p>

<p>"Well," said Daly, "I sat down, having first
very much ingratiated myself with old Bagswash, 
who was as chary of his pheasants as if
they had been of the golden breed, by insisting
upon it that his man Stephens should disencumber 
my bag of the birds which I had shot on his
land, retaining my solitary rabbit, in order to
grace my tale when I reached Wrigglesworth;
and there I found myself placed between mine
hostess, and number one of the daughters&mdash;very
nice, pretty thing&mdash;not what one should call well
set up, but Nature, as I said about gentlemen
to her papa, had done a great deal for her; poor
thing, how I pitied her!&mdash;and pity is akin to love.
So, after luncheon, and <i>some</i> wine, do <i>you</i> know,

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

Gurney, I almost began to subside into a tenderer 
feeling. But then, one of nine!"</p>

<p>"Well, and how did it end?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why," replied Daly, "it would have ended,
I have no doubt, as prosperously as it begun,
had not my new friend, Bagswash, committed
himself by begging me to drink some London
Particular Madeira&mdash;Duff, Murphy, Gordon,
or something of that sort. The moment I tasted
it I knew what it was, and rather elated by circumstances, 
and my other previous libations, I
had the temerity to address the dear, interesting,
white-necked creature next me, and in a tone of
confidential condolence, begged her not to be
deceived, for that although her amiable papa
might be a judge of other things, he evidently
knew nothing of wine, and that the stuff he
called 'London Particular' was neither more
nor less than infernally bad Teneriffe.</p>

<p>"The male Bagswash was unconscious of the
imputation, but the queen B. overheard me, and
looking towards what might literally be called
her open countenance, I saw symptoms of fire

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

breaking out, and in less than a minute afterwards 
the domestic Proserpine exclaimed, 'Come,
girls, let us go&mdash;too much of your <i>pa's</i> Tenreefe
will do you a mischief.' Up she got, and out
she wheeled herself, and the moment she set the
example, away went the nine she Bagswashes,
like so many goslings after the maternal goose.</p>

<p>"I," continued Daly, "regretted the retreat, 
for I had had an opportunity to insinuate
myself, and never saw an audience more thoroughly 
prepared to be gratified; indeed so convinced 
were they, from what they had heard of
me, that I was a vastly agreeable person, and
talked epigrams, that when, while they were all
sitting with their ears open to catch my <i>faceti&aelig;</i>,
I happened to observe (the first observation I had
made, too, and that, in reply to a question of
the big Bagswash) that I thought mustard went
remarkably well with cold boiled beef, they all
burst out into an immoderate fit of laughter;
and the Doctor, who had been tutored into a
belief in my superlative wit, exclaimed, 'Oh,
oh, that's too bad!' which every fool cries out,

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

either when he thinks a thing remarkably good,
or does not comprehend it in the least, which
last was the case&mdash;as indeed it was with all the
rest of the party&mdash;with my new-found medical
friend."</p>

<p>"Did you contrive," said I, "to affront the
rest of the company before you quitted it?"</p>

<p>"Not all of them," said Daly; "no; I believe 
I got off pretty well, but evidently the
worse for wear; for, Teneriffe or not Teneriffe,
it is my maxim to stick to the wreck as long
as she floats, and as long as I could get anybody 
to sit, I stayed; the curate and the boy with
the frill went with the ladies, but Bagswash
and the parish Paracelsus remained. However,
at last, seeing all the bottles empty, and no disposition 
on the part of Baggy to replenish, I
made a move, and never did I see a man more
happy at having got out of a scrape than mine
host. He sent his kindest regards to the Wrigglesworths&mdash;hoped 
to see me soon again&mdash;did I
know my road home? In short I cannot enumerate 
the civilities he heaped upon me, which,

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

considering his respect for my friend Sir Marmaduke, 
and the fact of his having nine unmarried 
daughters, I duly appreciated, and forthwith
bent my way homewards."</p>

<p>"Glad, I should think," said I, "to be safe
out."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Daly, "I should like
to have remained where I was; if it had not
been for the anger of the respectable cat of nine
tails about the Teneriffe, it would have been a
very agreeable domicile. However, once started,
onwards I went, rejecting indignantly, the offer of
Bagswash to send a man to show me the way&mdash;Nothing 
I hate so much; as if a man who had
followed his nose into a place could not follow
his nose out of it."</p>

<p>"I trust," said I, "that your intrepidity was
crowned with success."</p>

<p>"Rather crippled," replied Daly, "as you
shall hear; however, there are two ends to my
story, or rather a story and a sequel."</p>

<p>"Pray go on," said I, knowing that so long

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

as his breath lasted, his tongue would wag, as
a cherry clapper does, while the wind blows.</p>

<p>"Gad, Sir," said he, "I walked off&mdash;I admit
the Teneriffe to have been potent&mdash;and I
thought of one thing, and another thing, and
I believe I thought of all things in the world,
except the way which I was going. They say,
you know, some men have every sense but common 
sense;&mdash;my case to a hair. Common sense
is like flour,&mdash;the other sort of sense is like sugar,
and gilding, and all the rest of those things&mdash;beautiful 
to adorn a cake and embellish the
<i>patisserie</i>, but, without the flour, mere ornaments&mdash;now, 
without the ornaments, the flour
will make bread. I never had the flour&mdash;never
shall have. So you perceive that the sugar and
the flummery being my staple, on I went and
went, until I began to think I had missed my
way, and just then, I found myself stopped by a
gate opening into&mdash;or rather shutting me out of
&mdash;a remarkably well-stocked farmyard;&mdash;ricks,
stacks, stables, barns&mdash;everything comfortable

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

and convenient; with half a million cocks and
hens, walking about like ladies and gentlemen,
all as happy as happy could be. Over the gate
I stepped, waded my way through the straw, and
leaning over the hatch of one of his outhouses,
who should I see but the farmer himself. As
I advanced, he touched his hat, and civilly
asked whether I had had much sport?</p>

<p>" 'Not much,' said I, recollecting that the
whole contents of my bag now amounted to one
elderly rabbit with a Cape tail; 'I am on my
way to Wrigglesworth, and out of it too, as I
think. How far have I to go?'</p>

<p>" 'Seven miles, I count,' said the farmer.
'You are coming right away from it, Sir.
Wrigglesworth lies over there on your left.'</p>

<p>" 'Thank you,' said I, 'thank you. If you
will just give me a sort of concise direction&mdash;I
am a dab at topography. Merely give me the
points, and I'll go across a country I never saw
in my life before.'</p>

<p>" 'Well, Sir,' said the kind fellow, 'if so be
as that is case, I'll tell you. When you get out

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

of the gate down there, turn to your left, and
keep on straight till you come to Pussy's Nob;
then away to the right, over Sumpter's Green,
and you'll soon see the Crooked Billet. Don't
go near that; but turn short round by Wheatly's
Copse, keep on, till you come to the stile on
your left; go over that, through Timsbury's
Lane, and that will bring you out by the Three
Mackerel, and there they'll be sure to put you
in the right road.'</p>

<p>" 'Thank you,' said I to the farmer, 'I will
follow your instructions most implicitly; but I
suppose I shall have no chance of getting a shot
now in that direction&mdash;even at a pheasant roosting&mdash;eh?'</p>

<p>" 'No, Sir,' said the farmer; 'can't say as
how I think you will get many more shots this
evening.'</p>

<p>" 'Well,' said I, 'now both my barrels are
loaded. I've got nothing in my bag but an old
buck-rabbit with a nob tail; and as I hate going
home with no proofs of my sport, and the one
head&mdash;or tail&mdash;that I have bagged takes the

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

domestic character, what shall I give you to
have a shot with both barrels at all those ducks
in the pond, and the fowls on the side of it,
standing here, and to carry away what I kill?'</p>

<p>" 'You'll kill a woundy sight on 'em, I think,
at that distance,' said the considerate farmer.</p>

<p>" 'Perhaps yes&mdash;perhaps no,' said I.</p>

<p>" 'And to have all you kill?' said he, doubtingly.</p>

<p>" 'Yes; all I kill fairly out-and-out,' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Why, you shall give me half-a-guinea,'
said the man.</p>

<p>" 'Half-a-guinea!' echoed I. 'No, no; if I
kill three or four of them it will be the outside.
No; I tell you what I'll do. I'll stand here&mdash;won't 
move an inch; and you shall have a seven-shilling 
piece for the slaughter.'</p>

<p>"Well, Sir,' said the farmer, hitching up his
lower garments, 'a bargain's a bargain. Hand
over the twine.'</p>

<p>"Whereupon," said Daly, "I tipped him
that beautiful miniature portrait of a half-guinea,
and told him I was ready to take my shots.

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

He nodded assent; and, having pocketed the
money, bade me proceed. I did so. Crack went
one barrel&mdash;bang! slap went the other&mdash;bang!&mdash;and 
such a fluttering, and cackling, and
squashing and squabbling you never heard. I
ran forward, and secured, as my spoil, four hens
in high condition, a very respectable cock, fit
companion for my rabbit; and from the pond
fished, with the butt-end of my Manton, two
extremely corpulent ducks, who had paid the
debt of nature in the most decided manner:
these I got out, the others I got up, and stuffed
them all incontinently into my bag, delighted to
think what a display I should make at Wrigglesworth, 
where it was quite clear I could, by no
possibility, arrive in time for dinner. However, 
that was <i>my</i> joke, and it seemed to be the
farmer's; he laughed quite as much as I did."</p>

<p>"Inherent good-humour, I suppose," said I.</p>

<p>"Why, as for that," said Daly, "<i>you</i> shall
judge. I bagged my birds in the first instance;
and then, having secured my booty, began to
rally my victim; and having acknowledged his

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

civility in giving me my travelling directions,
said to him, with a low bow, 'Thank you for the
game, Sir.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Sir,' said the farmer, "you are a
deuced sight better shot than I counted upon,
considering what you had in your bag afore.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' said I, 'I think you are what you
may call "done." Seven shillings won't pay
for the poultry in my pouch, I guess.'</p>

<p>" 'No,' said the farmer, 'nor three times the
money, I count.'</p>

<p>" 'Well, then,' replied I, "I think I have the
best of the bargain.'</p>

<p>" 'Not much,' said the man.</p>

<p>" 'Not much!' cried I; 'why a guinea's
worth of fouls for a seven-shilling piece&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Yees, Sir, that's true,' said the fellow,
turning slowly away from the hatch, and grinning 
as he turned; '<i>but they are none on 'em
mine</i>.'</p>

<p>"I could have killed him for his roguery;
but there was so much fun in it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;So much in your own way," cried I.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

<p>"Exactly so," said Daly;&mdash;"that, instead of
breaking his head, which he most righteously
deserved, I joined in his infernal horse-laugh,
and made the best of my way out of the farmyard, 
lest I should be immediately apprehended
by the right owner, as a robber of hen-roosts."</p>

<p>"And," said I, "you carried home your spoils."</p>

<p>"Not I," exclaimed my unstoppable companion. 
"Take some wine&mdash;help yourself&mdash;and
listen; for the sequel is most terrible. I had
<i>such</i> a night of it!"</p>

<p>"How?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why," said Daly, "out of the gate I went,
turned to my left, and got to Pussy's Nob; but
it began to get dusk, and very soon afterwards
dark; and when I began veering away over
Sumpter's Green, I found myself on a wide
common, without path, guide, or guide post.
As the darkness increased so did the declivity;
and when I had lost all power of seeing, I was
gratified by feeling myself in a sort of quagmire, 
which for all I knew, might get softer and
thicker every step I took. I looked out for the

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

stars, and saw a few: but they were of no kind
of use to me; for I had not the slightest idea
what direction, even under their guidance, I
ought to take. I resolved to avoid the bogs;
and kept edging away, until I at length reached
a gap, which, as it led off the infernal common,
I hoped might lead to some habitation."</p>

<p>"Where spring-guns and steel-traps were set
every night," said I.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Daly. "I went on,
following my nose, until I found myself at the
edge of a copse, which I began to think looked
extremely like Squire Bagswash's preserve.
However, it was not <i>that;</i> but I heard people
talking at no great distance, and a call of
'Halloo!' How to act I did not exactly
know, with a gun, and a bag full of cocks and
hens, and a venerable rabbit to boot. What
could I do? To have answered the call would
have been to be detected as a poacher in the
dark. I resolved, at all events, on getting rid
of my poultry in the first instance, and accordingly 
emptied my store, rabbit, tail and all, and

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

proceeded somewhat more gaily after having
thrown out my ballast; yet not without some
apprehension, either of being shot by the
keepers for a poacher, or by the poachers for a
keeper; so I got clear of the whistling firs and
moaning larches as fast as I could, still utterly
ignorant of my course."</p>

<p>"And getting late," said I.</p>

<p>"It must then have been past eight," said
Daly. "On I trudged; scrambled over the
furrows of one field, and through the turnips in
another; and so on and on, until at last I was
forced to sit myself down on a gate and rest;
and, I give you my word, although I have
known a great deal of the world, I never was
so dead beat in my life as I was then. Not a
house could I see. The glimmering of a rushlight 
in a cottage window, would, in my eyes,
have been thrice more brilliant than the whole
regalia of England collected. But no: there
were no cottages&mdash;no rushlights; and I do believe 
I went the length of swearing at my own
stupidity in undertaking my solitary excursion.

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

Only one set-off was there to the whole thing;&mdash;I 
had seen the Bagswashes, male and female,
and laid in materials for an <i>historiette</i> for the
next evening&mdash;that is, if I really survived the
present one; but I began to feel cold, and
hungry, and thirsty. However, it appeared
pretty certain that out of the fields I must get,
if I went straight on end, and could not well
fail of fetching up in a road somewhere at last."</p>

<p>"Which, as you are here alive to tell the
tale," said I, "of course you did."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Daly, "I did; but it was
not for a long time; and then I had come to a
full stop; and striking the butt of my Manton
on the ground, I swore, by stock and barrel,
that I would not budge from under a huge tree
which overshadowed me till daylight came to
my aid. I was ravenous&mdash;I was chilled&mdash;I was
wretched&mdash;I was tired to death; but why tire
myself more?&mdash;and accordingly, feeling, and I
dare say looking, very like the dear Don of La
Mancha, I sat myself down with my back against

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

the trunk, and, if you'll believe me, fell fast
asleep."</p>

<p>"Asleep!" said I.</p>

<p>"Fast as a church," said Daly, "and dreamt&mdash;dreamt, 
first, that I was starving,&mdash;<i>that</i>, I
think, must have been a sort of waking vision;
then, that I was at a ball; and then I dreamt
of being safe back at mine host's hospitable
mansion; and then I had a confused, hurly-burly
kind of a dream, either that I was Sir Marmaduke 
Wrigglesworth, or that Lady Wrigglesworth 
was Mrs. Daly, or something of that sort,
and that I tumbled out of bed, which tumble
was to me a 'dying fall;' for I rolled over on
my side, and woke&mdash;in no bed&mdash;in no house,
but where I had lain me down, under the tree
before-mentioned."</p>

<p>"You must have caught your death of cold?"
said I.</p>

<p>"No, Dalys and cats are very tenacious,"
said my jocular friend; "I roused myself&mdash;sat
up and listened&mdash;recollected where I was, and

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

heard at the same moment what was really
'sweet music to mine ear,' the sound of a bell-team. 
Ho! ho! says I&mdash;you are <i>there</i> are you&mdash;where 
there are bells there are horses&mdash;where
there's a team there's a waggon&mdash;where there's
a waggon there's a road&mdash;up I jumped, and as
fast as I could, just roused from my slumbers,
scrambled over brambles and clambered over
fences, until I caught sight of the waggoner's
lantern waggling on the side of the tilt like a
bright pendulum to regulate the wheels; the
moment I saw <i>that</i> I knew I was landed, and
after encountering a few of those thumps and
bumps which 'flesh is heir to,' found myself
on a high road. Waggons, even those called
'flies,' may be overtaken, and although dead
beat, and sore of foot, I soon came up with
the eight plaited-tailed animals which were
dragging the mountain, second only in size to
the Juggernaut idol.</p>

<p>"My first object was to ascertain where I
was, and what the direction of the vast pile
before me. I found, to my particular satisfaction, 

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

that I was within two miles of Ripley, and
that the edifice was moving towards London&mdash;the 
result was, an involuntary spring upon the
shafts of the vehicle, and a look at the waggoner,
which, by the light of his revolver, was perfectly
intelligible. The gun, the gaiters, the grace,
and the gentility, spoke the gentleman, and he
gave me leave to assume the post which he himself 
was prevented by act of Parliament from
occupying. All my sorrows fled the moment I
felt myself moved along without any personal
exertion, and the smiles which had nearly been
exhausted during my toil and trouble, returned
as Moore sings to 'gild my brow.' 'I have had
walking enough,' said I to myself, 'and grieving
enough&mdash;<i>nunc est ridendum,</i>' "</p>

<p>"Excellent wag!" said I.</p>

<p>"Excellent waggon rather," said Daly, "for
so it proved; and after three-quarters of an
hour's hard tugging by the '<i>bell assembl&eacute;e</i>'
before me, I was dropped, gun, gaiters, bag and
all at the door of the Talbot&mdash;facing the green.
I tipped my driver&mdash;bade adieu to the tilt&mdash;and

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

began knocking loudly at the door of mine
ostlery."</p>

<p>"And a nice enough inn it is," said I.</p>

<p>"It turned out to be past midnight," said
Daly; "and by the merest luck in the world,
the exemplary widow who then occupied it had
not gone to her rest, or roost. She personally
answered my call, and replied to my knock.
After a few preliminary 'Who's there's,' she
opened the door; and the moment she recognized
me&mdash;for I was well known upon the road&mdash;her
delight, as you may conceive, was unspeakable.</p>

<p>" 'Bless my heart, Mr. Daly,' said the widow,
'what a time o' night to be strolling about with
your gun! Why, where do you come from?'</p>

<p>" 'That,' said I, 'is about the last question in
the world I can answer satisfactorily. I have
been wandering across a country with which I
am not particularly well acquainted&mdash;have tired
myself to death, and fallen asleep.'</p>

<p>" 'Fallen indeed,' said mine hostess, 'into a
ditch, Mr. Daly, I should think. Why, dear
me, what a condition you are in!'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

<p>" 'Exactly,' said I; 'recumbent repose in
October under an oak, is not particularly delicate; 
however, my darling, give me some supper, 
some hot brandy and water, and order me
the most comfortable bed in the house, for I am
a-tired.'</p>

<p>" 'Why, Sir,' asked the dear woman, 'where
is your servant with your clothes&mdash;you cannot
think of sleeping here in that condition?'</p>

<p>" 'Not exactly,' said I; 'I shall take off my
clothes when I go to bed&mdash;and as for my servant, 
he is snug and happy at Sir Marmaduke
Wrigglesworth's (where I ought to be too), unless 
they have sent him out with a rake and a
lantern to search for me and drag all the horse
ponds in the neighbourhood. I tell you I am
hungry&mdash;and tired&mdash;and shall be very sleepy&mdash;out 
with your tit-bits and delicacies&mdash;something
piquant&mdash;nice&mdash;savoury, eh&mdash;and after that, a
comfortable nest.'</p>

<p>" 'You shall have something to eat,' said the
widow, 'and something to drink, for those I can
give you myself; but as for a bed, I haven't

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

one in the house&mdash;crammed full from top to
bottom.'</p>

<p>" 'I'm very tired,' said I; 'I can sleep compact 
like a dog on a hearth-rug&mdash;half a bed
will do for me.'</p>

<p>" 'Come Mr. Daly,' said the landlady, 'none
of your nonsense&mdash;I have no bed whatever to-night, 
and here it is almost one o'clock&mdash;you
had better let me ring up the next turn-out, and
get back to Wrigglesworth.'</p>

<p>" 'Thank you Fanny,' said I; I used to call
her Fanny in her husband's time, and he was
killed, switching a rasper, three years before;
'not I&mdash;I should not get there till nearly four&mdash;all 
the family 'in a deep sleep buried,'&mdash;no,
no&mdash;none of <i>your</i> nonsense&mdash;where am I to
rest?'</p>

<p>" 'I told you the truth,' said the widow;
'there's not a bed disengaged.'</p>

<p>" 'Not one?' said I&mdash;looking as I fancied
most insinuatingly, and helping myself to a glass
of brandy from a bottle covered with a gilt
bunch of grapes, at the same time gently pressing 
the tip of mine hostess's little finger.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

<p>" 'Not one upon my life, Mr. Daly,' replied
she; 'indeed we are so full, that my sister Jane,
who is here, is obliged to sleep with <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>" 'That's very unfortunate, indeed,' said I;
'however, I rejoice that you have so much custom&mdash;all's 
good for trade&mdash;at all events let me
eat&mdash;let me warm myself&mdash;both in the sunshine
of those bright eyes, and in the blaze of the
parlour fire.'</p>

<p>"Mine hostess proceeded to make me exceedingly 
comfortable&mdash;I ate cold fowl and ham,
and drank hot brandy and water, and eventually
punch. Mine hostess sipped shrub&mdash;a liquor,
which if it were <i>liqueur</i>, would rank fathoms
above either Curacoa or Maraschino&mdash;till at last
the clock striking two, reminded her it was time
to go to bed.</p>

<p>" 'Ah,' said I, 'that is extremely just and
proper. But alas! I am like my melancholy
little friend who was "very gentil, but whose
hair came a leetle through the top of his hat," I
have no bed to go to.'</p>

<p>" 'It's very provoking,' said the landlady, 'so
tired as you are too.'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

<p>" 'It is, indeed,' replied I&mdash;seeing a proposition 
of some sort or other on tip of her
tongue.</p>

<p>" 'Now,' said she, looking remarkably serious, 
'can I trust you&mdash;will you promise me, if
I give you a bed, to do as I bid you, Mr. Daly?'</p>

<p>" 'Your commands,' said I, 'shall be obeyed
to the letter&mdash;only let me rest myself quietly
and comfortably&mdash;it is all I ask&mdash;for never was
poor devil so tired in his life as I.'</p>

<p>" 'Take a drop more punch, Mr. Daly,' said
my landlady, 'it will make you sleep the sounder.'</p>

<p>" 'No fear of that,' said I; "but what do you
propose?'</p>

<p>" 'Why,' said mine hostess, 'I <i>have</i> one bed
unoccupied.'</p>

<p>" 'Why didn't you say so before?' cried I.</p>

<p>" 'I'll tell you why,' said my fair friend; 'it's
a double-bedded room, and the other bed is occupied 
by a&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" '&mdash;&mdash;snoring farmer, from Farnham,' said
I; 'or perhaps a tight-skinned sailor walking
his way to town from Portsmouth.'</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

<p>" 'No,' said she, looking very pathetic&mdash;and
very pretty by the way&mdash;'by a lady.'</p>

<p>" 'A lady,' said I, 'oh, charming thought!&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'There it is,' interrupted the lady, 'that's
just what I expected, you are all fire and tow&mdash;
alight in a moment&mdash;now I shall not say another
word, and you must sleep, if you <i>will</i> sleep here,
in the arm-chair by the fire.'</p>

<p>" 'No,' said I, 'no&mdash;don't be angry&mdash;I didn't
know&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Mr. Daly, that's what you are always
thinking, I believe,' said mine hostess, 'but that
won't do&mdash;the lady who occupies the other bed
in the double-bedded room is a sad invalid; she
has been stopping here for some time, and the
only rest she gets is by dint of laudanum, which
the doctor gives her in large doses, and she
sleeps soundly during the night, which makes up
for the sufferings she endures by day. If you
choose to behave well&mdash;and tired as you are, I
don't like to turn you out or leave you here&mdash;you 
shall have the other bed. You must go
gently into the room, and when you are in bed

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

I will come and take away your candle; and as
I sleep in the next room, if you don't remain
perfectly quiet I shall insist upon your getting
up and coming down again here into the bar.'</p>

<p>" 'Agreed,' said I, 'I only ask for a bed&mdash;all
I want is rest&mdash;I am scarcely able to walk or
stand, therefore I agree to your condition; let
me finish my punch, and "marshal me the way I
should go." '</p>

<p>"After looking at me suspiciously and hesitatingly 
for a minute or two, my dear landlady
agreed to trust me; and accordingly having seen
that my bed was properly prepared she returned,
and lighting a candle, preceded me up stairs,
and opening the door of the room put her finger
to her lips to enforce silence, whispering me,
that when I was in bed I should knock against
the wainscot which separated her room from that
in which I was to repose, and that she would
come and fetch my candle.</p>

<p>"I promised to obey all her injunctions.
The curtains of the other bed were closely drawn&mdash;I 
never felt so awkward in my life&mdash;but I had

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

promised; yet one peep before the light vanished&mdash;no&mdash;perhaps 
the lady would wake and
scream, and I should be forthwith ejected. I
resolved to keep my faith, at all events till mine
hostess was herself asleep, and then see&mdash;as far
as utter darkness would permit&mdash;how the affair
would terminate.</p>

<p>"Accordingly I hurried off my clothes&mdash;washed 
my face, hands, and mouth as gently and
quietly as possible, and having concluded my
brief preparations for depositing myself in my
much longed-for couch, gave the concerted signal, 
and scarcely was well in my place before
my dear landlady entered the room on tiptoe, 
and coming up close to the bed-side and
having whispered 'Now remember your promise'&mdash;took 
the glimmering light away, and left me
in the dark with my fair and slumbering companion.</p>

<p>"There was something very strange in my
position," said Daly; "I was tired to death, but
somehow I could not sleep. I lay and listened
to hear whether my fair <i>incognita</i> would sneeze&mdash;or 

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

cough&mdash;or cry 'hem'&mdash;or play off any
little coquettish trick which, under the circumstances, 
I thought probable enough. I durst
not move for <i>I</i> knew I was watched; however,
I sat up in the bed and began to wonder&mdash;Is it,
thought I, an old woman or a young woman&mdash;an 
invalid is interesting, and bless her, she must
be uncommonly genteel, for she does not snore
in the least&mdash;a few minutes served to convince
me that my landlady did&mdash;and I rather rejoiced
in the sound of her slumbers, since I thought I
might perhaps succeed in attracting the attention 
of my sleeping partner; and the fact that a
gentleman of my very respectable pretensions
was so whimsically associated with her&mdash;knowing
mine hostess's archness&mdash;induced me to attribute 
her readiness to quarter me upon the slumbering 
beauty, to a foreknowledge on her part
that my introduction would not be considered
altogether an intrusion.</p>

<p>"After I had satisfied myself that my landlady 
was really safe, I had recourse to some
slight coughs, which do occasionally infest one;

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

but no, my signals were not answered: the dose
of laudanum had been particularly strong that
night. At last I thought I heard a slight movement. 
I began to listen, till I heard the beating
of my own heart, and felt a sort of drumming
palpitation in my ears. I held my breath: psha,
thought I, this woman has been cheating me,
the other bed is tenantless,&mdash;a trick to try me,&mdash;and 
for what a stupid dolt she will set me
down if I don't convince her that I had at least
curiosity enough in my composition to ascertain
what was in it.</p>

<p>"My feelings fired at the thought. Up I
got,&mdash;groped my way across the room,&mdash;the
white dimity drapery being just visible amidst
the 'palpable obscure.' I reached the bed,&mdash;I
paused,&mdash;I heard nothing;&mdash;I partly opened the
curtains at the side, and said in a soft, <i>very</i> soft
voice, 'Hem!' No answer. 'Ma'am,&mdash;Ma'am,'
still silent;&mdash;'are you there!' said I;&mdash;and,
placing my hand on the pillow, found she was.
Dear, unconscious creature, there she lay, comfortably 
cuddled up in the clothes, and sleeping

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

or seeming to sleep, soundly. I was, I admit, on
the point of proceeding to awaken her, in order
to announce my presence, when, in stepping
towards the head of the bed, my foot came in
contact with a chair which stood on its right-hand 
side, which was overthrown with a crash
that, in an instant, roused,&mdash;not my dear opium-drinker,&mdash;but 
my lynx-like landlady. I heard
her jump out of bed. I jumped into mine, but,
in less than two minutes, there she was, like
Margaret's 'grimly ghost,' standing before me,
loading me with reproaches, and ordering me,
in the most peremptory terms, to take the
candle, descend the stairs, and dress myself in
the parlour behind the bar, and wait until she
came down to eject me from the house; seeing
that she could have no kind of confidence in a
gentleman who had so much confidence in himself.</p>

<p>"Vain were my pantomimic supplications:
she would listen to nothing but immediate abdication, 
and I could not well be angry with her,
for she had put faith in me, and perhaps run the
risk of losing a valuable customer by indulging

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

me with the luxuries of ease and rest which,
under no other circumstances, she could have
afforded me. I implicitly obeyed her commands;
and, as soon as she had retired to dress herself,
collected my wearing apparel, and slunk down
stairs to prepare for my departure, which seemed
inevitable. As I passed along the passages, I
heard multifarious snorings in all directions,
which convinced me of the truth of my landlady's 
assertions as to the influx of company,
and made me repent more sorely than before,
that I could not for once in my life act with discretion 
and decorum.</p>

<p>"I had scarcely finished dressing myself
when my landlady made her appearance in the
parlour.</p>

<p>" 'I really am surprised, Sir,' said she, 'at
your conduct. I thought as a gentleman, you
might have been trusted, considering the circumstances 
under which I ventured to put you
into that room.'</p>

<p>" 'Really,' said I, 'I thought you were playing 
me a trick, and I could not bear your having

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

the laugh against me, and so I certainly <i>did</i> venture 
just to ascertain&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Ascertain!' cried the landlady, 'that's just
the very thing you ought, upon no consideration 
whatever, to have done. Did not I tell
you the lady was an invalid? Oh! Mr. Daly,
Mr. Daly! I believe you are the d&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" '&mdash;&mdash;evil be, Ma'am,' said I, interrupting
her, 'to him who evil thinks. I meant no harm,
and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'You might have ruined me, Sir,' said mine
hostess.</p>

<p>"Might I?' said I,&mdash;'when?'</p>

<p>" 'This very night, Sir,' said she; 'this very
hour. Why, what would have been thought of
me and my house, if it had been known that I
had allowed you to sleep in that room? Nobody
would have believed that I did it out of pure
regard for your comfort, tired and knocked up as
you were, and because I had not a hole or corner
besides into which you could have poked yourself: 
however, it will be a lesson for me another
time; and now, Mr. Daly, if you will take my

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

advice, the lads are getting up in the yard,&mdash;you
will let me order out a chaise and pair, and go on
to Guildford, where, I have no doubt, they have
plenty of beds, and where you may get some
comfortable rest; and as the brother of the lady
in No. 3 is sleeping here to-night, something
unpleasant to all parties might happen in the
morning, and you would do me a very great
favour if you would go.'</p>

<p>"I felt considerably inclined, for many reasons, 
to accede to what appeared the very reasonable 
desire of mine hostess: first of all, I
might do her a mischief by a staying; in the
second place, the lady might complain to her
brother; in the third place, the White Hart at
Guildford was a remarkably good inn; and a
well-made bed, and a well-warmed bed-room,
would be extremely comfortable by comparison
with the chilly atmosphere and the chair-slumber
of the parlour behind the bar, at Ripley. To
Guildford I must eventually proceed,&mdash;and why
not now? So, with the best possible grace, I told
mine hostess that I was at her command, and

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

begged of her to dispose of me as she thought
fit.</p>

<p>"I paid her liberally for the horses, the repast, 
and the portion of my night's rest which
I ought to have had; and when I stepped into
the 'yellow and two,' I shook hands with her,
and she gave me a look as much as to say, again
and again, 'Daly, Daly! you are not to be
trusted.'</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," continued Daly, "away I went,
glasses rattling, and wind whistling (a short
stage, as you know): and, before four we reached
the White Hart. I had forestalled my Guildford 
sleep in the chaise; however, we soon made
them hear at the inn, and in less than three-quarters 
of an hour I was again rolled up in
the sheets, having, before I went to bed, written
a note to my servant at Wrigglesworth, which
I desired might be sent off early in the morning, 
directing him, after leaving word with Sir
Marmaduke's man that I was alive, if not
merry, to come to me with my clothes and other
requisites for dressing by ten o'clock, and certainly, 

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

I must say, I never did enjoy rest and
quietness so entirely and completely, as upon
that particular occasion. Instead of ten o'clock&mdash;having 
desired that I might not be disturbed&mdash;I 
did not wake until past noon, and then regretted 
that my balmy comfort had been broken
in upon.</p>

<p>"From my servant, when I saw him, I
learned that my friends at Wrigglesworth
had really expressed great anxiety on my account, 
which did not displease me;&mdash;I rather
like to create an effect;&mdash;but I did not hear
that dear Lady Wrigglesworth had either absented 
herself from dinner, or disappeared for
the evening in consequence of my absence,
which I confess mortified my vanity a little. I
dressed, and having ensconced myself in the
drawing-room of the White Hart, the walls of
which apartment were most constitutionally decorated 
with loyal and orthodox prints, and
which immediately faces the Gothic House, I
delighted myself by watching the movements of
two uncommonly pretty girls in the said antiquated 

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

edifice, who appeared to be in full possession, 
in the absence, as I surmised, of some
greater, and probably graver, personages.</p>

<p>"After breakfast I strolled out. I like
Guildford; it is a nice, clean, handsome, healthy
town; the hill in the street I admit to be a
nuisance; the alternation between climbing up
and sliding down is tiresome and even dangerous. 
These little objections did not affect me&mdash;nothing 
affects me when I am on the hunt for
subjects&mdash;so away I went&mdash;smack bang into a
quaker's shop to buy myself a pair of gloves&mdash;and 
there&mdash;there I saw what I had never before 
seen&mdash;two quaker children playing about
the place, thee'ing and thou'ing each other,
with perfect French familiarity. Now, do <i>you</i>
know,"&mdash;continued Daly,&mdash;"it is quite worthy
of remark,&mdash;that nobody&mdash;always, I presume,
excepting quakers themselves&mdash;has ever seen a
quaker baby in arms&mdash;a quaker lady <i>enceinte</i>, or
a quaker gentleman with a <i>wooden</i> leg&mdash;eh? I
like these statistical speculations.&mdash;So, having
bought my gloves, I returned to 'mine inn'

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

about one, intending forthwith to proceed to
Wrigglesworth.</p>

<p>"Just as I reached the door of the White
Hart, and just as my man was bringing out my
horses, my eye was attracted by a funeral procession, 
consisting merely of a hearse, one
mourning coach, and a private carriage, which
had halted before the door; two persons who
had occupied the coach having entered the
house while fresh horses were put to the three
vehicles. A natural and not very blameable
curiosity prompted me to ask a jolly, merry-looking 
undertaker, whose funeral it was, whither 
they were going, and whence they had
come?</p>

<p>" 'Why, Sir,' said the man, 'what you see
here isn't the regular job as I hopes to turn it
out at Chichester next Tuesday, which is the
day fixed for the interment of the corpse. Short
notice, you see, Sir; could not do everything in
a minute, Sir.'</p>

<p>" 'What is the name of the&mdash;&mdash;?' I hesitatingly 
asked.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 241 -->

<p>" 'Miss Barmingfield, Sir,' said the man,
'is the name of the corpse. Poor young lady,
it was as well as you and me three days ago,
and was a coming down to Chichester to spend
a month with its mother; when, just in a minute,
it was taken ill at Ripley, and out it went for
all the world like the snuff of a candle.'</p>

<p>" 'At Ripley!" said I: 'did she live at
Ripley?'</p>

<p>" 'No, Sir, she didn't,' said the undertaker;
'you'll excuse <i>me</i>&mdash;she died there.'</p>

<p>" 'But she must have lived there first, I
presume,' said I, rather angrily; for a joker
hates to be joked upon.</p>

<p>" 'A very short time, indeed,' said the jolly
undertaker. 'She arrived at the Talbot the
day before yesterday, about twelve o'clock, in
high health, and by six at night, as I said
afore, she was a corpse.'</p>

<p>" 'At the Talbot!' said I. 'And are you
bringing the body from the Talbot now?'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Sir,' said the man; 'on our way to
Chichester. We could not move her, poor dear

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

young lady, afore, because I couldn't get things
ready till this morning.'</p>

<p>" 'Pray,' said I, with a degree of agitation
which evidently astonished my companion in
the crape, 'where&mdash;in what part of the Talbot
at Ripley did the young lady die?'</p>

<p>" 'In Number 3; that 'ere double-bedded
room right over the gateway,' said the man.
'We only packed her up this morning.'</p>

<p>"My dear Gurney," said Daly, "you may
easily imagine what my feelings were. Only
conceive the idea of having been turned into
a double-bedded room in the dark with a dead
woman! It was lucky that the horses were
pronounced ready, and that Major Barmingfield, 
whose residence at Ripley mine hostess
so truly had announced, made his appearance
just at the moment that the undertaker had
enlightened me on the subject. I felt a mingled 
sensation of horror at the event, of joy at
my escape from the place where it occurred, and
of repentance for my misconduct towards my
landlady, who had so good-naturedly strained a

<!-- vol 1 page 243 -->

point for my accommodation, which nearly overset 
me; and I have not a notion what I should
have done, had it not been that the coldness of
the weather afforded me an excuse for drinking 
off a glass of brandy, and the lateness of
the hour forced me to mount my nag and begin
my canter to Wrigglesworth forthwith."</p>

<p>When Daly had finished this little episode in
his eccentric and eventful life, I felt particularly 
sick,&mdash;I might say sympathetically sick.
He perceived the effect his story had produced,
and calling for Dejex himself, prescribed a
glass of Garus, at that time the popular liqueur;
and then whispering some directions about
egged-wine, desired me to finish the claret,
and commence a new course of drinking.</p>

<p>The subsequent events of that evening require 
a new chapter.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much has been said and written from the
days of Shakspeare to our own degenerate
times about the vice of drinking, that I have
no intention of dilating upon its folly and
disgracefulness; but in confessing that I drank
a great deal too much of every thing exciting
and intoxicating upon this particular occasion, I
may perhaps be permitted to say, that although,
under the influence of agreeable conversation
and a bad example, I might be induced now
and then to exceed, I was not habitually
addicted to what are called Bacchanalian pleasures; 
and that one bout similar to that to

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

which I now refer, generally produced at least a
six weeks' course of repentance. So it was upon
this memorable night&mdash;for memorable, indeed,
it proved to me; and so rapidly did our potations 
affect my faculties, that in the plenitude
of our mutual confidence&mdash;by which, be it
understood, I mean the confidence of Daly in
inquiring, and my own confidence in answering&mdash;I 
imparted to him the secret of my attachment 
to an amiable, dear, unsophisticated,
creature, who was living in the romantic and
beautiful sea-port of Tenby, in South Wales;
whither she had been conveyed, as it had been
hinted to me, to get her out of my reach, by
her mother, whose designs for her were of the
Corinthian order, and who had no notion of
allowing her lily to waste its sweetness upon a
desert "heir" to four or five hundred a-year.</p>

<p>I just recollect the enthusiasm with which I
described my Emma's beauties as the lamps
twinkled before my eyes, and the various
"drinks" which Daly had ordered passed over
my senseless palate; but I was diffuse in my

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

eulogiums, and candid in the extreme as to
the certainty of my failure in obtaining the
golden apple of the Cambrian Hesperides,
watched as it was by the matronly dragon, who,
as I firmly believed, detested me.</p>

<p>In those days there really existed something
like sentiment and affection, devoted and unqualified 
by worldly grovellings. Now, these
exist no longer; nobody ever hears of an
unmarried woman's being seriously attached;
the highly-accomplished and double-refined
beauty of the period at which I write would
be shocked to death if she were thought to be
what in other times was called being in love.
Girls like dandies, and with the dandies whom
they like they flirt, and they waltz, and, if it
happens to be quite convenient to all parties,
eventually marry them. Wit and accomplishments 
have taken place of that sober serious
devotion, which "looked unutterable things;"
and a man, in these times, convicted of having 
been upon his knees, would be as much
damaged in the estimation of the sporting

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

world, as a horse would be for the same
reason.</p>

<p>But when I was sitting sipping and sighing
at Dejex's it was not so. I remember treasuring 
a fan of Emma's, as I would the relic of
a saint, aye and worshipping it too. To a
white kid glove ripped at the thumb, I have
bowed as pilgrims would at a shrine; and a rose
which once had graced her bosom has been
deposited in the leaf of some favoured book
to dry, a botanical memorandum of her beauties
and my own devotion.</p>

<p>I have a faint recollection of Daly's strong
encouragement in my pursuit, and a most
earnest protestation of assistance in any of the
man&oelig;uvres of the post-chaise and rope-ladder
school, to which, if I ever possessed my Emma,
I must be indebted for that happiness. I
remember, too, I loved to hear him talk of the
possibility of my success, and the facility with
which all our machinations were to be carried
into effect, till at last I had dreamt myself into
a certainty of obtaining the hand of one whose

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

heart I was quite sure I had already gained,
and only awoke from the semi-slumberings of
happiness to pay the bill, Daly having most
unfortunately left his purse at home, and having
no change whatever in his pocket.</p>

<p>I do not recollect our further proceedings
with any degree of distinctness. I knew we
were to walk to St. James's-street, where Daly
proposed introducing me to a participation in
the noble game of hazard; and I have a faint
remembrance of stopping to pay an evening
visit to some relations of his on our way thither;
but it seemed all like a bright vision of some
very lovely good-natured ladies, and vastly
pleasant men, who appeared to make me entirely 
welcome to the party, and who drank
punch with unaffected delight. All sublunary
pleasures must have an end, and however agreeable 
this "drop in" might have been, we at
length "dropped out" and pursued our journey
to the gaming-house in which I was to make
my sporting <i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i>, and which I recollect stood
on the left-hand of the street, near the Thatched

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

House Tavern, and had a white bow window
projecting over the <i>trottoir</i>, somewhat resembling 
a well-fed alderman's white waistcoat.</p>

<p>There is always something awkward and
embarrassing in the <i>premier pas</i>. The first
speech of the politician&mdash;the first sermon of the
parson&mdash;the first cause of the lawyer, by necessarily 
putting the performer in a novel
position, agitates, and in some degree unnerves
him; and although I had somewhat recklessly
presented myself to a most respectable and
accomplished party of Daly's female friends,
before we reached our present destination, I felt
nothing very awful in my position there; one
party is so very much like another, and conversation 
and manners, in modern times, so very
much assimilate in all circles, that whether in the
neighbourhood of Grosvenor-square or Leicester-fields, 
a man, knowing a little of the world,
will, as a matter of course, find himself equally
at home. But when we stepped up two or
three stairs, and our progress was impeded by
a stout door made of three-inch plank, and

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

covered with green-baize, in the middle of the
upper part of which appeared a small sort of
wicket or hatch, through which the Cerberus
of the inner regions eyed us, in order to ascertain 
whether we were admissible or suspicious,
I felt a sort of qualm, and a kind of wish to
return; but my nervousness was entirely dissipated 
when I heard Daly tell the man, whose
eye glanced out of the hole like that in the
sign-board of the "Observer" newspaper, or in
the puffing bill of Dr. Smellome's nostrum,
that I was a friend of <i>his;</i> upon which "Open,
Sesame!" of my hopeful conductor, I found the
door thrown back in order to admit us. Upstairs
I went, and half-way farther up we encountered
another door similarly contrived and pierced;
but, at this barrier, Daly's face was sufficient for
passport without a word, and in a minute
afterwards, we were ushered into the room,
where the game was in full play.</p>

<p>I confess the smell of the lamps which overhung 
the round table&mdash;for in those days refined
French hazard was unknown to us&mdash;and of the

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

company was rather oppressive; the noise of
the dice, the cry of the groom-porter, and the
bawling of the betters, somewhat astounded
me; but I admit&mdash;such is the influence of
sensuality&mdash;that the appetite which my copious
libations at Dejex's had fictitiously produced,
received an additional stimulus, not unaccompanied 
by the hope of gratification, when I
beheld in the recess of the bow-window before
mentioned, a table plentifully covered with an
excellent cold supper, at which divers and
sundry of the company were indulging themselves 
<i>con amore</i>. I began to think my simile,
on first sight of the window, was now perfectly
borne out, and whatever might be the sporting
character of the assembly generally, the <i>comestibles</i> 
were most judiciously and naturally
placed in what I had likened to an alderman's
waistcoat.</p>

<p>I was not soon induced to join in the game,
although a gentleman, whose hat was not of the
newest, and who was buttoned up to the very
chin in a sort of military great coat, offered me

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

his seat the moment I approached the table;
but I whispered to my <i>fidus Achates</i>, that
whatever interest the game might have for
others, the cold meat and pickles offered a
more attractive subject for my present contemplation. 
There, however, he checked my
eagerness for the attraction, by hinting, that,
as the supper was furnished <i>gratis</i>, I could not,
with anything like propriety or gentlemanly
feeling, undertake to play with my knife and
fork at a table where the keepers of the
establishment must be sure to lose, unless I
also performed at the other, where the chances
were considerably in favour of their winning.
In order to exemplify the absolute necessity of
this probation, he told me that, although he
was quite as hungry as myself, he should
entirely abstain from eating, because (as I
knew) he had no money to play with; he
therefore could not qualify for the refreshment,
which, as in masonry, seemed only to be afforded 
after labour.</p>

<p>Of course I did not allow my free-hearted

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

friend to starve for such a paltry consideration
as that, but instantly handed him out of my
purse a five-pound note, with which he said
he would play for both of us, so that he might
at once increase the store, and give me a proper
insight into what he represented to be a most
pleasing and profitable pursuit.</p>

<p>I must confess that, after ten minutes sojourn
in the midst of the motley group, all those
alarms and prejudices which my grave friend,
the justice, and my exemplary mother had so
prudently instilled into my mind as to the
horrors of gaming-houses, which, in the earnestness 
of their zeal for my safety, they constantly
designated by a word wholly "unfit for ears
polite," had utterly and entirely subsided; I
saw nothing but good humour and good fellowship. 
Some won their tens, and twenties, and
fifties with perfect good-nature, and others lost
them with equal complacency. Daly made me
sit down beside him&mdash;the box came&mdash;he called
a main. I did not even know the term&mdash;seven's 
the main, said Daly&mdash;he threw again,

<!-- vol 1 page 254 -->

and out came eleven, upon which the gentleman 
in the chair with a rake in his hand, cried
out "Eleven's a nick," and immediately I saw
my five-pound note converted into a ten, by a
process which appeared to me not only extremely 
simple, but remarkably pleasant. Daly
threw again, again called seven and threw nine;
a loud cry of "Five to four," rang through the
room; "Fifty to forty," cried one, "Done,"
bawled another,&mdash;"Do it in fives, Colonel,"
screamed a little man very like a frog in the
face, upon whose back an Irish gentleman was
sitting or leaning, pushed forward by half a
dozen eager spectators behind <i>him</i>. I heard
nothing but "Five to four" for a minute or
two, varied with a counter-cry of "Nine to
seven;" then a pause, broken only by the
rattling of the dice, and then a call of "Nine&mdash;the 
caster wins;" whereupon notes and guineas
changed hands all round the outside rim of the
table, and Daly swept up ten pounds as a stake,
and five for his single bet.</p>

<p>I was then as much pleased with the practice

<!-- vol 1 page 255 -->

of the game as I had just been with the principle, 
and although Daly "threw out," as they
called it, next time, and lost five pounds, it was
clear he had realized fifteen; so that having
myself been a winner of seven before, on our
partnership account, I took the box, and covered 
five sets of one pound each, omitting the
more important ones, which I could not afford
to touch. I called my main, seven&mdash;and threw
it&mdash;raked up my money, and called again,
seven; threw deuce-ace; upon which the monster 
in the chair bellowed out "Crabs," and
made no more ado but swept away all my stakes,
and whisked the dice out of my reach with a
kind of rat-trap which was stuck to the end of
his stick.</p>

<p>Having, however, now done my duty by
playing, although I had neither lost nor won, I
nudged Daly as to the eatables; he assented to
my practical proposition, and we quitted the
round table for the long one, where I admit I
felt myself more of an adept than at the other.
During my repast, which I enjoyed, Daly was

<!-- vol 1 page 256 -->

particularly assiduous in disabusing my mind
with respect to the illiberal prejudices by which
sporting men were so regularly assailed. He
pointed out to me many men of high distinction, 
fathers of families, men holding high
ostensible situations, who were actively engaged
in the fascinating pursuit, and dwelt particularly 
upon the misapplication of the gross term,
universally applied to houses of that description.
"So far," said Daly, "from hazard being
considered a wrong or disreputable game, you
know, of course, that the kings of England, till
the reign of George III., used annually, on
Twelfth-night, to play hazard in an open room
in St. James's Palace, which ceremony the
public were admitted to witness. Hence the
name given to these places of amusement.&mdash;The 
room in which the king publicly exhibited 
himself to his people, doing exactly
what all our sporting friends are doing here,
was called as those houses are now called on
account of its darkness by day, and hence the
opprobrium which has fallen upon us players in

<!-- vol 1 page 257 -->

modern times, who congregate in places which,
to the delicate imaginations of little masters
and misses, deserve the same horrible appellation 
on account of their infamy, instead of
having received it from the court itself: hence,
too, the title of my worthy friend in the chair
with the rake&mdash;he is called groom-porter&mdash;why,
nobody on earth could possibly surmise, who
did not know that in the royal hazard-playing,
which I have just mentioned, it was the duty
of the groom-porter of the palace to call the
odds."</p>

<p>"That I did <i>not</i> know," said I, excessively
pleased to find that the temple of chance did
not deserve the hard name which, from mingled
ignorance of its honest joys, and the derivation
of the name itself, my parent and guardian had
thought proper to give it. I believe I appeared
sceptical as to my friend's facts, which, however,
made him more earnest in his asseverations;
and when I ventured to express a doubt that
any room in a palace could be called by such
a name, he convinced me of his correctness by

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

telling me that it was the room in which the
birth-day odes were always performed, which
odes it was customary to rehearse previously at
the concert room in the Devil Tavern, Fleet-street,&mdash;a 
circumstance which, I then saw, gave
the only point they possess, to the well-known
lines on the poet laureate of the day.</p>

<p>Somehow, Daly succeeded in soothing all
my alarms, and quieting all my scruples, and I
found myself almost insensibly swallowing large
jorums of cold brandy and water, thereby
merely following the example of my surrounding 
neighbours, who evidently were friends of
the concern, if not of the house, and who appeared 
taking in provision enough to serve
them for the next three days; and in this calm
state of amusement, in the midst of the din and
rattle, which at first I could scarcely endure, I
went on until, tempted by the good fortune of
Daly, I began to feel an unaccountable desire
to resume my place at the board. In making the
effort, I found myself more unsteady than I had
expected; however, the distance was not great,

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

and aided by Daly, I seated myself again at
the table. I did not like to mention to Daly
the promised division of spoils, because I
thought he might go on and win, as he seemed
extremely lucky, and that it would be better to
let him take his own way. Accordingly, I
drew forth my only ten-pound note, last resident 
of my purse, and began my career. A
most assiduous friend, whose face I had never
seen before, brought me a new edition of
brandy and water, which I drank, and then took
the box and played with small and varying
success; but the heat and excitement very soon
produced a sensible alteration in my deportment. 
I began to wish to find Daly and to
retire, but my eyes in vain wandered over the
group; I inquired of a man with whom he had
been conversing, and found that he had taken
his departure. I was surprised that he should
have left me in the hands of the Philistines,
but much less alarmed or mortified than I
should have been under any other circumstances. 
I drank more, and played on&mdash;and on&mdash;and 

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

on. Nor did consciousness come to my
aid until I was awakened by my servant coming
into my room to fetch my clothes, at about nine
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>His address to me was somewhat astounding&mdash;"Where 
shall I put all this money, Sir?"
said he. I looked up, and saw him in the act
of withdrawing from my <i>coat</i> pocket a handful
of bank-notes, ones, twos, fives, tens, and so
on.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, affecting a perfect composure,
"leave it on the table."</p>

<p>So he did; but out of the room he had not
gone one minute before I jumped out of bed to
ascertain, not how the sum before my eyes
came there, but to what it amounted. I concluded 
I had won largely&mdash;but who had brought
me home&mdash;how did I get to bed&mdash;did I open
the house door with my own pocket key? I
had no recollection of any incident intervening
between the last jorum of St. James's Street
nectar and my first start from the slumbers of
Suffolk Street,&mdash;there, however, lay some clean,

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

some dirty, some torn bank-notes, of all sorts,
amounting in all to three hundred and seventy-five 
pounds.</p>

<p>How these notes had become mine I could
not recollect; that they had remained mine
while I was in a state of such perfect unconsciousness 
convinced me that the men who are
unceremoniously denounced as villains universal
and undeniable, were not quite so black as they
are painted&mdash;else how could I have been suffered 
not only to win when fortune favoured me,
but permitted to carry off the produce of my
success? This act of highly creditable integrity, 
done towards me in youth, I admit has
had a very powerful effect in regulating my
subsequent opinions of the characters of men
like those by whom I had been, on the preceding 
night, at once surrounded and protected<span class="sup">1</span>.</p>

<p class="small">[<span class="sup">1</span>It was some months after this occurrence that I ascertained
to whom I had been indebted for the care and trouble not only
of preserving my winnings, but of conveying me to my very
room.]</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

<p>Having cast a hurried glance over my newly-acquired 
treasure, I returned to bed, taking
with me two letters which I found on my table&mdash;one 
I knew to be from my mother, the other
was in a strange hand. Anxious to have the
lecture of my excellent parent over, and to
hear how she bore Daly's visit, upon the subject 
of which I was quite sure she would write,
I opened hers first, and therein perused the
details of the affair very much as Daly himself 
had described them, but with a sequel least
agreeable of all, informing me of the recognition 
which the Miss Dods had made of the
"rude and forward" deputy assistant clerk,
and her extreme sorrow and vexation that it
could be no longer concealed, since his acquaintance 
with me had been admitted, that I
was the companion of his most unjustifiable
frolic. As far as that went, as I had secretly
resolved to marry nobody but Emma Haines,
it was a matter of no great importance, to <i>me</i>,
although the acquaintance with the young
ladies would have very agreeably enlivened

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

the circle at Teddington, had I intended to make
the cottage a place of frequent resort. Matters
had now entirely changed as far as my means
and inclinations were concerned; the previous
night's conversation with Daly had quite determined 
me on my course. He had overcome,
with arguments which I considered full of sound
reason and justice, all the boyish scruples I had
hitherto felt with regard to filial obedience upon
points where the heart was concerned, and was
completely convinced that love&mdash;love of that
peculiar sort which Daly had made me sensible
I felt for Miss Haines&mdash;was paramount to all
other sentiments, duties, or affections.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary to see with what facility a
shrewd and clever person can win over a less-experienced 
man to the principles he advocates,
provided their character and tendency are in
unison with the less-experienced man's feelings!
I could not understand what it was that had
hitherto kept me tongue-tied with respect to
Emma, a being I loved by stealth, as far as my
own parent was concerned. I owed my mother

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

the allegiance of a son it was true, but I had a
right to an opinion of my own, and Emma
Haines had a fortune of five and twenty thousand 
pounds, and the match would be a good
match, and she was fond of me and I was fond
of her; what then was the objection?&mdash;her
mother's positive refusal to hear of such a
thing as a proposal from a pennyless boy; and
this refusal I knew, if I mentioned any thing
on the subject to my parent, would heat up the
Gataker blood to boiling, and I should be as
solemnly warned by my own mother to desist
from any further attempts upon the heart of
Miss Haines as I had already been by hers.</p>

<p>However, rope-ladders, post-chaises, and all
the rest of it, were dancing in my imagination;
and for an instant I believed that fortune had
at last withdrawn the fillet from her eyes, and
already displayed her favourable intentions
for the future by putting in my possession, by
her own means, a sum adequate to defray all
the necessary expenses of my juvenile matrimonial 
expedition. With these bright visions in

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

my mind's eye, it may be supposed I did not
read my poor mother's details of Daly's visit
with any profound attention; but hastily scanning 
the letter, I threw it down in order to
make myself acquainted with the contents of
the other epistle. I broke open the seal and
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="right">"6 o'clock, Friday.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;I despatch this to you the moment 
I reach town. I was called into your
mother at a little after three, whom I found in
a very afflicting state, from an attack of apoplexy. 
Having taken the most effective measures 
at the moment, I set off to town as fast as
I could in order to find and carry down Dr.
Baillie to her. I arrived just now, and while
he is getting ready to return with me, I write
this. Let me entreat of you not to lose a
moment in going to her; for, although I would
not excite unnecessary apprehensions, her case
is a serious one, and may <i>prove very dangerous</i>.
Nothing I can add will express the urgency of
your visit more strongly than the simple fact

<!-- vol 1 page 266 -->

that having restored her to consciousness before
I quitted her, the first words your mother uttered 
were your name, and an entreaty to see
you."</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>When I read thus far, the letter fell from my
hand&mdash;my eyes swam&mdash;my head turned round.
I felt that mad impatience, that necessity for
immediate action&mdash;that wildness of purpose,
which are the instant results of intelligence like
this&mdash;my mother dying and calling for me&mdash;dead, 
perhaps, without seeing me, and I revelling 
in heartless pleasure, in sensual dissipation,
in moral turpitude, and actually planning future
disobedience to her wishes, and revolts from her
just and affectionate control. She who had
borne me, nursed me, loved me better than herself, 
to be neglected and forgotten!&mdash;yet I was
not so base&mdash;so vile. I could not have anticipated 
the awful visitation; I had seen her well
the previous evening&mdash;had parted from her&mdash;had 
received the fond, maternal kiss&mdash;perhaps
the last. There were no symptoms, no warning

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

of this thunder-stroke which was so soon to fall
and sever, perhaps, the ties of affection and
love; yet how could I reflect that I might have
been home early; that I might have received
the letter from the village apothecary, which I
had just read, in time to have seen her, even to
have received her last blessing, and to have
closed those mild blue eyes which for years and
years had beamed so tenderly on <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>I struck my forehead with my clenched fist&mdash;I 
hid my burning cheek in the pillow&mdash;tears
relieved the agony of my heart. I rang the
bell&mdash;my servant came. I ordered him to get
the horses instantly. He evidently thought me
mad&mdash;I think I <i>was</i> so. I had, never since I
could remember, been so near a great calamity,
such as the loss of a beloved parent&mdash;a neglected
parent, now seemed to be&mdash;neglected indeed
she was; for while I knew that she was within
my reach, I was careless as to visiting her; her
house was made unpleasant to me by her ungracious 
companion, and, as I have said before, my
mother's temper itself had been unfavourably

<!-- vol 1 page 268 -->

changed by the influence and irritation of that
odious person; yet now that there was a chance
that she was gone, that I should never see her
smile, never hear her voice again. . . . .</p>

<p>In this temper of mind, I need hardly say
that I flew rather than rode from London. I
was insensible to every object, to every feeling&mdash;to 
every impression but the one&mdash;and the
idea that my poor mother was, perhaps, on the
verge of another world, and that an increased
rate of travelling might yet bring me to her fond
embrace, made me urge the willing animal
upon which I was mounted to the top of his
speed. In less than an hour I reached Twickenham. 
As I entered the road leading to Teddington, 
a fatal sound struck my ear. I pulled
up my horse and listened&mdash;with a dread beyond
imagination I heard it again. I turned sick&mdash;my 
heart seemed to cease its pulsation;&mdash;it was
too surely the death-bell tolling for my poor
lost, lost mother!</p>

<p>The blow had fallen&mdash;no more was there
need of hastening to the house of mourning.

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

Not all the prayers of all the world could give
me now that which of all things most I craved&mdash;that 
mother's blessing. No; mute was the
tongue which had taught me truths I heeded
not&mdash;cold were those lips from which a parting
kiss would have been some consolation in the
hour of separation;&mdash;I had lost them all&mdash;all by
my own heartless folly and dissipation&mdash;by my
addiction to the society of those against whom
her affection and experience had so often cautioned 
me;&mdash;while yet my sainted parent lay
on the bed of death, I was revelling and gambling 
in the house of sin!</p>

<p>I dismounted, and bade the servant go on
with the horses. I could scarcely stand, and
I could not bear the man to see how little of
a man his master was. He trotted forward, but
I could not stir. I leaned against a tree by
the road-side, and cried like a child.</p>

<p>Ought I to be ashamed of this confession?&mdash;no;&mdash;the 
loss of such a parent was of itself
calamity sufficient to unnerve a son at my time
of life, who knew the devotion of that parent

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

to her child; but the aggravating circumstances,
my absence from her bed-side; the reasons for
that absence; the thousand, thousand recollections 
which flashed across my mind&mdash;I would
gladly have died myself upon the very instant.</p>

<p>I walked on; and as I approached our little
church, the sound of the bell tolling louder and
louder as I came nearer to it, cut to my very
heart's core; for its hollow clang had to my ear
even less of sorrow in it, than of reproach;&mdash;it 
seemed to upbraid me for my absence, and
chide me for delay. Oh! how true it is that
when those we have adored are gone&mdash;when
those lips we have loved are sealed in silence,
and can no longer speak a pardon for our indiscretions 
or omissions&mdash;we reproach ourselves
with inattentions and unkindnesses, which, at
the time we then fancied them committed,
would perhaps have been matters of indifference 
or even jest.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by my feelings, I pursued my
way to the well-known entrance of my poor
mother's pretty&mdash;once cheerful residence.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

<p>I reached the gate&mdash;the windows of the
cottage were closed&mdash;and my mother's favourite
dog lay whining on the outside of the door&mdash;it 
ran to me, and barked its welcome as I
walked across the lawn. The door was opened,
as I approached it, by my mother's maid. I
never shall forget the expression of mingled
grief and censure which her countenance exhibited 
as her eye met mine; the faithful woman's
look conveyed at once to me the extent of my
misconduct&mdash;it told me I had been sought for&mdash;asked 
for&mdash;prayed for&mdash;but I was absent. My
conscience added a thousand pangs to those
which that absence alone could not fail to inflict.</p>

<p>I passed into the drawing-room, where I
found Miss Crab. I threw myself into the
chair in which I had last seen my poor mother
sitting, and, hiding my face in my hands, gave
vent to my sorrow in another flood of tears.
Miss Crab came to me, and took my hand, and
pressed it. I felt grateful for this show of
kindness, for I was alone in the world&mdash;and I
wept the more.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 272 -->

<p>"I know," said Miss Crab, "that arguments
are useless&mdash;I will not attempt to check the
course of natural affection. Your excellent
mother, Gilbert, is gone; but, sudden as was the
summons, she died without pain, and departed
repeating your name, and blessing you."</p>

<p>"And I not here," sobbed I, "to hear that
blessing!"</p>

<p>"That was unfortunate," said my companion;
"you must have been out very late, because
any time in the evening you could have come;
your poor mother, when she became conscious
of her danger, watched the hours, and every
noise she heard fancied it announced your
arrival."</p>

<p>"And when&mdash;" said I, "when&mdash;&mdash;?" I
could ask no more.</p>

<p>"Between four and five this morning," was
the answer.</p>

<p>The hour, then, at which I was unconsciously
returning from the gaming-table, was the period
at which the pure spirit of my exemplary
parent was taking its flight&mdash;at that moment&mdash;Oh 

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

mercy, mercy on me!&mdash;my mother was in
the last agony of death.</p>

<p>Miss Crab saw the convulsive heavings of
my breast; the half-choked utterance of my
words alarmed her, and with a kindness foreign
to her nature, she left me for a moment, and
returned with a tumbler of water, of which she
made me swallow a portion.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," said she, "to see you
thus affected; if you had been with her at the
last, it would have been a source of consolation
whenever the thought of her recurred; but now
you will never be able to forget that, anxious
as she was, to take a last farewell of you, you
were out of the way! However, what's done
cannot be undone, and I suppose at <i>your</i> time
of life pleasure is paramount."</p>

<p>"Pleasure!" said I; "do, for Heaven's sake,
spare me this reproachful language; years&mdash;ages 
of repentance&mdash;will not compensate for
this one fault."</p>

<p>"I always told you, Gilbert," said the odious
woman, "that you would be sorry some time or

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

another, but not till it was too late; I'm sure
I would not say a word to aggravate the bitterness 
of your feelings just now, but I <i>do</i> think
that if you had been more attentive to your
poor mother's wishes, and been more with us,
and gone on more steadily, she might have been
here now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Merciful Heavens, Madam," exclaimed I,
"do you wish to drive me raving mad? Is it
not enough that I have lost the being who bore
me, nurtured me, and loved me better than
herself? am I to be reproached not only for
faults I admit, but for conduct for which she
herself never blamed me?"</p>

<p>"Not in your presence, Gilbert," said Miss
Crab, "and that was the misfortune; she
was too fond of you; and when you were
here, she could not endure to see you pained
by her remarks; it was when we were alone
that her anxiety and sorrow evinced themselves, 
and preyed upon her spirits and constitution."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," said I, angry in the midst

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

of my wretchedness, at such insinuations, "do
you mean to infer that I have contributed by
any conduct of mine to shorten the life of my
excellent parent?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> mean no such thing," said Miss Crab;
"all I know is, that Dr. Baillie said last night
that he considered the attack to be the result
of mental agitation, and certainly she was very
much excited yesterday by the discovery of
your connexion with that surveyor's clerk, who
behaved so rudely to her great friends the
Dods."</p>

<p>"Surveyor's clerk," said I, spurning with disgust 
the idea of entering into any explanation
of the affair with my fiend-like companion at a
moment when she was pronouncing the greatest
calamity of my life the result of my own indiscretion 
and irregularities. What a heart
this woman must have had! I have often, on
looking back upon these scenes, wondered how
anything in female form could be so bitter and
so malevolent.</p>

<p>"I cannot talk," said I; "I will not listen;

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

all my omissions and negligences are magnified
in my own eyes ten thousand fold&mdash;I see them
all in the most vivid colours&mdash;I need no <i>friend</i>,
however kind, to point them out&mdash;but even I
cannot consent to admit the justice of the
charges you so unseasonably bring against me,
or acknowledge myself an accessary to my poor
mother's death."</p>

<p>I rose from the chair and paced the room in
an agony of grief. "I suppose," said my <i>friend</i>,
after a pause, "you will go up and see her,
Gilbert?&mdash;you will be more composed afterwards."</p>

<p>See! see my beloved mother&mdash;she whom I
had left in health and happiness but a few hours
before&mdash;see her stretched in the sleep of death?&mdash;to 
be sure&mdash;to be sure I would. It was all
like a dream&mdash;a dream from which, when I had
beheld her dead, I must awake.&mdash;I mechanically 
answered "Yes," and as mechanically
followed my <i>friend</i> to the door of the bed-chamber&mdash;the 
door at which a thousand times my
lost parent had parted from me with a blessing

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

and a kiss. We entered the apartment; everything 
was as I had last seen it&mdash;the flowers
which my mother had gathered the day before,
were blooming in their stands&mdash;her work lay on
the table&mdash;all seemed as usual.&mdash;My companion
took my hand in one of hers, and led me to the
bedside:&mdash;with the other she drew back the
curtain, and there I saw her&mdash;my mother&mdash;cold,
pale, inanimate&mdash;<i>dead</i>. The world's supplication 
could not have obtained me one single look
from those closed eyes&mdash;there was a smile on
her lips, but they were mute for ever&mdash;I had
never seen death before&mdash;the thousand feelings
of awe, of devotion, of sorrow, of repentance,
conflicting in my heart and mind, were too much
for me; and, overcome by the contest, I sank
insensible on the bed.</p>

<p>Oh that week&mdash;that wretched, miserable week&mdash;the 
hateful preparations for the funeral&mdash;the
absolute necessity for action&mdash;perhaps it was
better that such arrangements required attention. 
For myself I resolved that the hour at
which my mother's dear remains were removed

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

from the house should be the last of my residence 
in it; I could never have borne to see it
after she was gone. This resolution produced
new occupation. Miss Crab, whose fine feelings 
were never likely to interfere with her
worldly interests, appeared disposed to stay
where she was. My mother had made a will,
in which she had left everything to me, excepting 
the lease and furniture of the cottage, which,
if Miss Crab chose to continue resident there,
were bequeathed to her for her life; this bequest,
and one of a ring to Cuthbert, were the only
two. In consequence of Miss Crab's announcement 
of her wish to remain at the cottage, and
of my determination never to disturb her quiet
possession by even a solitary visit to the scene
of my former happiness, it became necessary
that certain inventories should be made, and
other forms gone through, to carry the intentions 
of my poor mother into effect. In
those arrangements I was aided and assisted by
the worthy magistrate whom I have already
mentioned, and who came down to Teddington

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

the moment the melancholy intelligence reached 
him.</p>

<p>He too accompanied me to the funeral. That
day will never be forgotten by <i>me;</i> till the moment 
I saw the black coffin borne from the door,
I did not feel that I really had lost my beloved
parent&mdash;the link was not <i>quite</i> broken; but then&mdash;then 
all my sorrow burst upon me, and I was
scarcely conscious of what afterwards occurred,
until the drawing up of the ropes by which the
body had been lowered into the grave, awakened
me again to a sense of all my miseries. Years,
years have rolled on, and yet that hour is still
vividly fresh in my mind&mdash;the smell of the
soldered coffin is still in my nostrils&mdash;the
falling earth upon its lid still rings in my ears.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Turn</span> we from this melancholy passage in my
life&mdash;suffice it to say, that I have never passed
through Teddington since the event with which
the last portion of my memoranda concluded.
Perhaps I need not add, that I equally avoided
Miss Crab, who (for the reader's satisfaction I,
perhaps, might mention it), in about a year after
my mother's death, married one of the neighbouring 
apothecaries, who, she wrote me word to
say, made her a very kind and comfortable husband. 
He had two daughters by a former wife&mdash;a 
blonde and a brunette. Kitty, a tigress&mdash;
Jenny, a lamb. The one a black dose, the

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

other a mild emulsion. How they made it out
with their acidulated mother-in-law, I never
troubled my head to inquire; with the death of
my exemplary parent my care and consideration
about the Crabs and their connexions departed.</p>

<p>I wrote of course to my brother Cuthbert, at
Calcutta, giving him information of the event
that had occurred, and I took counsel of my
worthy friend, the Justice of Peace. But taking
counsel and taking physic are different things&mdash;his 
worship prescribed what I could not swallow,
and therefore, although I took the advice earwise, 
I did not act upon it. He suggested my
immediate departure for India in order to avail
myself of the advantages which the great success 
of my nearest relative would secure me,
and offered to introduce me to a Captain Pillau,
or some such person, whose twelve hundred ton
ship was a floating London Tavern, with cows
in the launch, salad in the windows, fresh rolls
three times a week, and champagne on Thursdays 
and Sundays&mdash;but what were these to me?
I was in full possession of four hundred and

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

eighty-seven pounds, nineteen shillings, and
eleven pence per annum, besides the interest of
four thousand pounds, three per cent. consols.
Why should I send myself out in a huge packing-case, 
to look for a fortune which I should not be
able to realize until my powers of enjoying it
were gone? Pale nankeens, with bilious-looking
silk stockings&mdash;cotton shirts, and calico waistcoats, 
were to <i>my</i> eyes, objects quite familiar in
the north-western regions of the metropolis.
Why should I waste my youth and manhood
in Qui-hi-ing one half the day, and salaaming
the other, with the glass at ninety-five in the
shade, until I at fifty, should look as if I were on
the shady side of ninety-five?&mdash;No. With <i>my</i>
pretensions and accomplishments&mdash;for, like Daly,
I did a little of everything&mdash;nothing so well as
he&mdash;but still&mdash;I thought I <i>might</i> make my
way, and even achieve the great object of
my ambition, Emma Haines, whose twenty
thousand pounds would come in remarkably
well.</p>

<p>Emma was the point in which all my hopes

<!-- vol 1 page 283 -->

and wishes centered, so soon as I had recovered
from the shock, which, especially under its
peculiar circumstances, my mother's death had
occasioned. The heart, robbed of what it has
been cordially and warmly attached to, naturally
yearns for some new object to claim and engross
its affection. I certainly was devotedly fond of
Emma;&mdash;she was so graceful&mdash;so lady-like&mdash;so
gentle&mdash;so mild&mdash;there was a meekness in her
eye while the mind was reposing, which lighted
into brightness and brilliancy the moment her
feelings were excited or her genius roused;&mdash;she
played&mdash;she sang&mdash;she drew&mdash;she talked&mdash;in
short, she was a most bewitching person; and
there was a swan-like swimmingness about her
air and gait&mdash;a sort of sylphy something that
rivetted the attention and charmed the heart.
I <i>do</i> believe at first she encouraged my attentions 
out of pure good nature. She was older
than I was; or rather, perhaps, I should say,
about my own age; but as a girl of seventeen is
a woman, when a man of seventeen is a boy,

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

she saw how much I loved her, before I was
myself conscious of it.</p>

<p>Her mother had certainly&mdash;incautious, I
believe, through kindness&mdash;encouraged my acquaintance; 
and I used to be constantly at their
house:&mdash;<i>my</i> mother knew nothing of them; but
my young theatrical friend in Lincoln's Inn
had carried me there, and so I went on, like a
silly moth, buzzing about the vestal flame until
at last my wings were thoroughly scorched, and
then, as I told Daly on that horrible night, I
avowed my feelings and was rejected&mdash;not by
Emma herself&mdash;but by her mother, who, having
written me a letter which would have driven a
stoic mad, set off for South Wales, where, as the
reader already knows, my lovely girl was immured, 
as I fancied against her will, at the period
of my mother's decease.</p>

<p>I have already expressed my feelings with
respect to Daly, whose acquaintance I had so
strangely made; and certainly for some time my
sensitive regrets as to the employment of <i>that</i>

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

evening, which I have felt it my duty to record
at length, operated as a prevention to our future
association&mdash;however, as time wore on, I naturally, 
and perhaps, justly argued, that although
the things we did, and the course we took that
evening, were, seriously and morally speaking
indefensible; still, whatever might be the blame
due to my companion for introducing me to
such scenes, the melancholy fact of my mother's
sudden attack and death, could not be adduced
in aggravation of his faults&mdash;like myself he
was, of course, ignorant of the crisis of her
fate; and therefore, although powerfully connected 
in my imagination in the outset, as those
sad circumstances were, I began to dismiss from
my mind the combination which had made me
so incalculably miserable at first, and in proportion 
as this needless horror was dissipated I
began to exonerate my friend, and even seek
his society; for having&mdash;and I was conscious of
<i>that</i>&mdash;confided to him the history of my Emma,
I was most anxious, now that I felt more than
ever the necessity of having something to love

<!-- vol 1 page 286 -->

and esteem, to consult him upon the plan best
to be adopted to carry my wishes into execution.</p>

<p>I was quite delighted with his frankness, his
friendship, and his zeal; he told me what I
believed, because I wished it true, that it was
impossible to doubt, after what I had told him,
that Emma was devoted to me&mdash;that my expectations 
that she would write to me was extravagant, 
that girls were extremely averse from
corresponding; first, because they properly considered 
such clandestine communications indelicate 
and undutiful; and secondly, because
very young men are apt to be vain of female
confidence, and perhaps, might, in some unguarded 
moment, be induced to boast, or even
show the letters of their unguarded mistresses.
Daly was right. Emma was quite well enough
aware of the ways of the world not to trust a giddy
thoughtless fellow such as I then was; but, nevertheless, 
she might be prevailed upon to grant
me an interview, if I went to Tenby, and by
some means&mdash;not literary&mdash;solicited it.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

<p>"Action, my dear friend," said Daly, "action
is the thing;&mdash;you may sigh and swear away
four sides of foolscap&mdash;most appropriate paper&mdash;and 
what then?&mdash;you have done nothing but
record sentiments which the circumstances of a
few years may entirely alter, and pledged yourself 
to a constancy which events may try, and
even overthrow. No;&mdash;put yourself into the mail
coach&mdash;start for Tenby&mdash;hide yourself up&mdash;find 
out her house&mdash;walk under her window,
and whistle some favourite air; if she loves, she
will instantly recognize it&mdash;she will be
delighted to find you so active and zealous; and,
ten to one, if her respectable parent can be by
any means disposed of, the very next evening
will find you strolling by moonlight&mdash;if there
should be a moon&mdash;or in the dark, if there
should not&mdash;either along the beach or on the
cliff, breathing out all those delicious protestations 
upon which lovers live, 'as larks on
leeks.' "</p>

<p>"Out!" said I, indignantly&mdash;"do you suppose 
that it would be possible for Emma to

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

'come out,' as you call it 'to take a walk?'&mdash;Why 
she is watched and guarded as if she were
'one chrysolite;' her mother would as soon die
as hear of her 'taking a walk' by moonlight."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Daly; "faint heart you
know, &amp;c.&mdash;where there's a will there's a way;
and if you choose to follow my advice, 'I'll
back the caster in.' "</p>

<p>"The deuce take that phrase," said I; "no&mdash;no; 
Miss Haines is not to be so proceeded
with; and yet I admit, I think a visit to Tenby
would be adviseable, because I might plead with
her mother."</p>

<p>"Plead!&mdash;no," said Daly&mdash;"practice before
preaching any day. All I can say is, if you
are in need of an ally&mdash;if you want an assistant&mdash;a 
Leporello in short, I am your man&mdash;my
whole delight is doing good. I have no object
but to serve my friends; and, if you think that
I can be of the least use in securing you Miss
Emma Haines and her twenty thousand pounds,
you have only to say, 'Daly do'&mdash;and Daly
will."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

<p>It was impossible for me not to feel grateful
for this kindly burst of feeling, and the offer
which my companion made; and I confess it
affected me more powerfully, because during
the time at which my grief completely unmanned 
me, and absorbed all my faculties, he
was, whenever he could obtain admittance to
me, the most sympathizing of human beings.&mdash;He 
regretted, in such an amiable manner, the
absurdity of his self-introduction to the cottage,
and spoke of my mother's manners and conversation 
in such terms of admiration and esteem, 
that I felt convinced, whatever might be
his eccentricities, his heart was in the right
place; and having established this opinion in
my mind, I resolved to trust him with the management 
of my Tenby scheme, for the success
of which he himself appeared most unaffectedly
anxious.</p>

<p>The conversations of my enthusiastic friend
had very considerably elevated my hopes. He
extracted from me every particular of Emma's
person and character; the one, after my report,

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

he pronounced angelic, and the other perfect;
but I must say, in the midst of his warmth and
energy, and in the full flow of exalted sentiment, 
he <i>did</i> come out, as the people say, with
something that astonished me.</p>

<p>"Are you sure now, Gurney," said he "that
she <i>has</i> this money?&mdash;because we hear of fortunes, 
and of hundreds of thousands of pounds,
and so much a year, and such and such estates,
and West Indian property, and Irish property,
and all the rest of it, which at last turn out to
be nothing&mdash;sometimes worse than nothing.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I declare, Daly," replied I, "that I know
nothing more of her fortune than common
report affords; and moreover, that I consider it
quite unimportant, whether it amount to the
specified sum or not."</p>

<p>"Have you never ascertained?" asked he.</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "how should I?&mdash;could I
ask Emma such a question, or her mother?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, my dear friend, certainly not," said
Daly; "but if you will take the trouble to walk
with me, to-morrow morning, to St. Paul's

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

Churchyard&mdash;turn to your right, through the
court, across Carter Lane, thence through Court
number two, into Knight Rider Street&mdash;you
will see opposite to you, the Prerogative Office;
there, my dear friend, for the trifling and inconsiderable 
charge of one shilling we will read the
last will and testament of the late respectable
father of your amiable Emma, and discover
whether 'all is gold that glitters.' "</p>

<p>"Is that to be done?" said I.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Daly; "it is the just
prerogative of an Englishman to know what his
neighbour does with his property if he have
any; and as I have already told you, that in love,
where there's a will there's a way, so you will
see that in law, where there's a will there's a
way, to find it out&mdash;therefore, to-morrow we
start&mdash;<i>le premier pas</i>&mdash;to the Prerogative Office,
and although it may cost us something, it is but
a shilling, and anything like confirmation about
other people's affairs is 'dirt cheap at the
money.' "</p>

<p>I really was not sufficiently well-informed as

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

to the privileges of the people, at that moment,
to know that Daly was right in his statement;
and even when he told me the simplicity of the
process by which all his doubts as to Emma's
fortune could be set at rest, I felt a disinclination 
to adopt it; for really and truly, I had
often before wished that she had had nothing,
inasmuch as I fancied that if it were not for the
difference in our circumstances, I might not be
personally objectionable to her mother.</p>

<p>When the morning came, and I called upon
Daly, according to appointment, to proceed to the
Prerogative Office, of which he had talked, I felt
as if I was about to do something underhanded and
ungentlemanlike. Why should I pry into the private 
affairs of a family? Why gratify my curiosity 
at the expense of the independence of feeling
in which I used to glory? For all these questions
Daly found ready answers; and, as usual, the
ice of my prudery was thawed by the warmth of
his manner, and the energy of his protestations;
and accordingly off we went&mdash;searched the office&mdash;paid 
our shilling&mdash;got our little slip of paper&mdash;showed 

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

it&mdash;had down the volume which contained 
the desired document&mdash;spread him upon
a desk, and began to read the contents.</p>

<p>I admit myself to have been nearly as ignorant
of the purport of the last will and testament
of Joseph William Haines, Esq., after I had
perused it, as I was before I had seen it. Not
so, Daly. He was a bit of a lawyer, and he
explained and expounded the whole mystery of
the affair, and informed me that the "upshot" of
the matter was most satisfactory&mdash;inasmuch as
it appeared that twenty thousand pounds were
irrevocably and unconditionally Emma's&mdash;but
if her mother married again, that sum was to
be doubled; and the mother's jointure, which
was two thousand five hundred pounds a-year,
was to be reduced one half, and, in addition to
the rest, revert to her daughter at her death.
The estates themselves, upon which the jointure
was a charge, were also to become Emma's
after the decease of her parent, if she married
with her consent, during her life time; but
if not, they were to be otherwise disposed

<!-- vol 1 page 294 -->

of, with a variety of contingencies and consequences 
Hebraically obscure to my comprehension.</p>

<p>"I see the thing in a moment," said Daly.
"Come along&mdash;the affair is settled&mdash;we shall
make ourselves extremely comfortable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We!" said I. "How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Thus," said Daly;&mdash;"the mother has two
thousand five hundred a year, untouchable by
fate, so long as she lives a widow&mdash;the daughter's 
twenty thousand is equally secure. But
you perceive, that if the mother marries, the
daughter's fortune is to be doubled, and the
widow's jointure to be diminished by half. Mark
me&mdash;I have a strong disposition for settling&mdash;twelve 
hundred and fifty pounds a year will do
for <i>me</i>. I'll marry the mother, which will produce 
a splendid increase of fortune to the
daughter, with whom you shall afterwards have
the felicity of eloping if you think proper&mdash;or
if not, receive her hand with the full and entire
sanction of her respectable father-in-law, your
most obedient humble servant, to command."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 295 -->

<p>"Visions! visions!" said I. "Mrs. Haines
will never marry again."</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> the doubt?" said Daly; "if that be
all, let not that embarrass you."</p>

<p>"But would you?" said I, staring with
amazement&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would I!" exclaimed he; "trust me for
that&mdash;a well-jointured widow against the world
for settling with. It's a fine sight, Gurney&mdash;quite 
refreshing, as the Cockneys say, to see the
comfortable ease and independence of a dowager&mdash;the 
lozenged panels of the luxurious carriage&mdash;the 
fat black nags with their long tails and
kicking-straps, the curly-wigged coachman with
his three-cornered hat on his head, and a bouncing 
bouquet stuck in his button-hole."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "Mrs. Haines is not likely
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave me alone for that," interrupted my
voluble friend. "If you think the scheme a
good one, I am your man."</p>

<p>"And would you," said I,&mdash;"as I was just

<!-- vol 1 page 296 -->

going to ask&mdash;would you marry a woman so
much older than yourself?"</p>

<p>"Age is now like air, my dear fellow," said
Daly; "felt by all, but seen by none. I'll
marry her&mdash;take her down to Dullmusty Hall,
or whatever the name of her place may be&mdash;
twaddle about with her for a month, in a broad-brimmed 
straw hat, with a spud in my hand&mdash;do
the domestic for the first four weeks&mdash;then put
dowwy out to grass at one of her own farms&mdash;allow 
her three hundred a year out of her own
jointure, and expend the <i>residuum</i> in the purchase 
of cross-bows, pop-guns, magic-lanterns,
fire-balloons and sky-rockets."</p>

<p>"A profitable outlay for yourself," said I,
"and a pleasing prospect for Mrs. Haines."</p>

<p>"Rely upon it, the scheme is practicable,"
said Daly; "however we may confer upon it
and consider;&mdash;this evening you are engaged
at Lady Wolverhampton's, where, I flatter myself, 
you will be pleased. She gives a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> after
a new fashion&mdash;live fish in the drawing-room.

<!-- vol 1 page 297 -->

and a cow on the staircase&mdash;fact&mdash;fact, my dear
Gurney; and if I don't contrive to make some
fun, my name is not Daly."</p>

<p>"Remember the Dods," said I, "recollect&mdash;I 
will not consent to be made a party to any
more practical jokes."</p>

<p>"But," said Daly, "Lady Wolverhampton's
parties are nothing but practical jokes themselves. 
Her <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of to-night is a masquerade&mdash;at
least to as many people as like to assume characters&mdash;so 
that a vast many respectable persons
who don't choose to go to her house without
concealment, will be there <i>incog</i>., much to
their hearts' delight. I mean to make my appearance, 
in the early part of the evening, as a
Jew boy, selling macaroon cakes&mdash;come in with
my basket full of tempting delicacies, which the
eager company will snatch away in order to
devour, like so many dragons&mdash;mum!&mdash;there's
fun in <i>that</i> depend on't."</p>

<p>"The fun of paying for the cakes, and seeing
other people eat them," said I.</p>

<p>"True&mdash;" replied Daly; "but the results&mdash;

<!-- vol 1 page 298 -->

the afterwards, as I say&mdash;macaroon cakes, ordinarily 
manufactured, would afford no sport.
My man, under proper medical superintendence,
sprinkles in with his sugar, certain powders
of a peculiar quality, which, however salutary,
taken now and then, are not usually administered 
in a ball-room. You'll see a scattering!&mdash;poor 
devils!&mdash;the gormandizers will be
nicely served&mdash;the endemic of a Margate-hoy
will be but a trifle to the indisposition of her
Ladyship's visitors&mdash;first one ill, then another,
eh&mdash;'si <i>sick</i> omnes.' "</p>

<p>"My dear Daly," said I, in a dissuasive
tone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Soyez tranquille, mon cher Gilbert</i>," interrupted 
Daly; "there's nothing like fun&mdash;what
else made the effect in Berner's Street? I am
the man&mdash;<i>I</i> did it; sent a Lord Mayor in state,
to release impressed seamen&mdash;philosophers and
sages to look at children with two heads a-piece&mdash;piano-fortes 
by dozens, and coal waggons by
scores&mdash;two thousand five hundred raspberry
tarts from half-a-hundred pastry-cooks&mdash;a squad

<!-- vol 1 page 299 -->

of surgeons&mdash;a battalion of physicians, and a
legion of apothecaries&mdash;lovers to see sweethearts; 
ladies to find lovers&mdash;upholsterers to
furnish houses, and architects to build them&mdash;gigs, 
dog-carts, and glass-coaches, enough
to convey half the freeholders of Middle-sex 
to Brentford. Nay, I despatched even
Royalty itself on an errand to a respectable
widow lady, whose concourse of visitors, by my
special invitation, choked up the great avenues
of London, and found employment for half the
police of the metropolis."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I," said Daly, triumphantly;&mdash;"copy the
joke, and it ceases to <i>be</i> one;&mdash;any fool can
imitate an example once set&mdash;but for originality
of thought and design, I <i>do</i> think that was
perfect. However, to-night shall transcend
even that effort, and to-morrow we start for
Tenby."</p>

<p>"Let me ask you," said I, "now&mdash;if you can
be serious&mdash;have you really any intention as to
Mrs. Haines? because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 300 -->

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Serious, to be sure," said Daly; "I
never joke but when I am in earnest&mdash;like a
Frenchman, who is never grave but when he
is dancing. I think my arrangement capital,
and so will you. We will go to Tenby together; 
or, if you prefer it, I will start alone, and
appear to know no more of <i>you</i>, than one of the
cads of the thimble-rig knows of the pea-holder.
I will make my play, and, the moment I am in
possession, make signals for you&mdash;eh?&mdash;We'll
settle all that in the course of the forenoon; but
for the present, let us return to the habitable
part of town, and make our masquerading preparations 
for the <i>soir&eacute;e</i> at Wolverhampton House."</p>

<p>There was something about Daly that I cannot 
describe: but he had only to suggest, and I
implicitly obeyed. I had never ventured to
inquire as to his means or fortune; and although
the unbroken and unmitigated silence he had
observed as to our joint winnings on the odious
night at the gaming-house, raised a suspicion in
my mind that he was not rolling in riches, as
they say, I thought that his abstinence from any

<!-- vol 1 page 301 -->

allusion to that adventure, arose very probably
from a delicate disinclination to awaken in my
mind the recollections inseparable from the
occurrences of that evening. As we walked
along the Strand, Daly did, however, what he
had never yet done&mdash;invited me to dine with
him at his lodgings. "Let us," said he, "dine
late, and we can go together to the Wolverhampton 
affair&mdash;you must put up with what you
can get&mdash;I live small, according to my means:
but after I have married my duck in weeds, the
amiable mother of your angelic Emma, I will
give you&mdash;emblematic of our affection and constancy&mdash;turtle, 
whenever you dutifully come
and see us."</p>

<p>I, of course, could not object to dine with my
friend; and accordingly settled the engagement 
for seven, and we parted after a somewhat
protracted walk "to meet again."</p>

<p>I confess, the readiness with which he fell into
my views, and the quickness with which he
seized the abstruse points of the testamentary
document of the late respected head of the

<!-- vol 1 page 302 -->

Haines's, mixed with the sudden resolution
which he appeared to have formed of marrying
the dowager, gave me an idea that, although
there was something like method in it, madness
was the particular reigning malady under which
poor Daly laboured? yet there was so much
plausibility in his manner, and so much real
friendship in his professions, that I could not
doubt his earnestness and good will towards
me.</p>

<p>At or about seven, therefore, I proceeded to
his lodgings, where I found covers for three
laid in his sole sitting-room, into which his bed-room 
opened; in which latter apartment he was
occupied, when I reached the scene of action,
dressing. Having heard my arrival, he begged
pardon, from the next room, for being so
late at his toilette; and told me to amuse
myself with the evening newspaper until he
should have completed it. I implicitly obeyed
the injunctions of my yet invisible friend who
shortly after joined me, finished for the evening,
with the exception of his neckcloth, the tying

<!-- vol 1 page 303 -->

on of which he reserved for the last moment,
lest the indulgence of home feelings might in
any way disturb the symmetrical arrangement
of his favourite folds. Well do I remember the
nervous anxiety with which men, in those days
studied the art of tying the cravat; and I recollect 
a friend of mine who had provided himself
with no less than four to experimentalize upon,
who spoiled them all in the putting on, and was
actually obliged to wait at an inn on the Portsmouth 
road, in the neighbourhood of the house
to which he was going, when dressed, while his
servant travelled to town in a post-chaise and
four, and returned with a fresh supply.</p>

<p>"I expect a man to meet you," said Daly,
"who will go with us to Lady Wolverhampton's&mdash;where 
you know I have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>. I am her
pet-plaything&mdash;a sort of Jonkanoo general for
her dignity balls&mdash;and you will see me in my
element there.&mdash;As Dr. Cauliflower the putty-headed 
physician says, I ought always to have
my jacket ready to tumble in&mdash;thank my stars,
Gurney, I can tumble without one&mdash;I admit I

<!-- vol 1 page 304 -->

lead my Dow Wolf a deuce of a life, but she
loves me. I catch lions for her&mdash;which is a
prodigious merit in her eyes."</p>

<p>"Catch lions!" said I&mdash;staring like a fool.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Daly. "One of them
feeds her to-day&mdash;a Count Stickinmeyer, a very
distinguished person in his way."</p>

<p>"And what way is that?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, faith, I hardly know," said Daly;
"he has had one empress and two queens
desperately in love with him&mdash;has killed divers
and sundry of his friends in duels, and by
these traits&mdash;endearing to the female heart&mdash;has
worked his name into a glorious notoriety. In
these warlike times, a foreigner, not an <i>emigr&eacute;</i>,
is a great catch, and he is here on some diplomatic 
business; <i>ergo</i>, the Dow Wolf would have
him. I have seen a good deal of him during
his stay here; and so I am to be the leader of
the bear. He has one peculiarity&mdash;he cannot
speak six words of English&mdash;but he talks it as
fluently as either of us; you'll see how, in a
moment after he arrives;&mdash;upon the principle

<!-- vol 1 page 305 -->

of living from hand to mouth, he makes his
words as he wants them; the consequence is,
a jargon of the most extraordinary character,
which he firmly believes to be English; and
which, more extraordinary still, answers every
purpose of the most refined study of our embarrassing 
language."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Daly finished his description of
his friend, when he arrived; and having introduced 
him to me, Daly proceeded to order
dinner forthwith.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Count," said Daly, "what
news?&mdash;any more conquests?"</p>

<p>The moment I had time to contemplate the
Count's features, I recognized, with no pleasurable 
feelings, one of the faces which, some
months before, had flitted before my half-seeing,
double-seeing eyes at the gaming-house. This
did not prejudice me much in his favour, I
admit.</p>

<p>"No news," said the Count; "none&mdash;de
unneusability of de week is quite observationable&mdash;dat 

<!-- vol 1 page 306 -->

is, by de stoppupishness of de communications 
from de controversialness of de
continental postability."</p>

<p>Daly looked at me after this curious specimen
of our native language, aiding the expressiveness 
of his countenance by a wink&mdash;I acknowledged 
the attention by a slight nod, apprehensive 
lest the Count should observe his bye play,
and add him to the number of victims, who,
according to his account, had suffered by his
sword, like so many larks on a spit&mdash;however,
the Count's vanity as a linguist of the proficiency 
he had made in our language, secured
him, as I afterwards found, from any chance of
discovery.</p>

<p>"You have been some time in England?" said
I, enquiringly.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah," said the Count, "so you guess
from de perfectibility of my tongs; I declare, I
haf qvite lost my own tongs in de acquisitionness 
of Angleish, and my coutrymen to whom
I give rencounterance in de assemblations stare

<!-- vol 1 page 307 -->

to find what a impetuousness of perfectation I
have to spike a foreign tong, so as to be always
miscomprehended for natifs."</p>

<p>"I declare," said Daly, "I should have
fancied, if not an Englishman, that you had
spent the greatest part of your life amongst
us."</p>

<p>"You are too flattersome. Dally," replied the
Count, "some people haf an aptiverousness to
de possession of tongs&mdash;far excellecizing; others
whose condensability of faculty is diversified
into a ramificationness of stoddy to generalize,
what you call de universality of accomplicesment."</p>

<p>"Clearly," said Daly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Count, "a sort of pollyglottability 
which is foreign to de desiration of
dose who have some diversationizing of mind
regardful to objects quite antipodistical to de
oders."</p>

<p>I confess, I was very much relieved from the
difficulty I had of preserving my gravity, by
the appearance of Daly's servant with the

<!-- vol 1 page 308 -->

dinner&mdash;which, in the first instance, consisted
of two dishes, one larger than the other, which
were put down; Daly seating himself on one
side of the table, and placing us at either end
of it. The covers removed, we found before us
a remarkably delicate looking roasted leg of
lamb in the larger dish, and some exquisitely
verdant spinach in the other.</p>

<p>"What no fish, Redmond?" said Daly to his
servant.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said the man.</p>

<p>"Well," said Daly, "no matter&mdash;I told you
Gurney, you must take what you could get&mdash;and 
as for Stickenmeyer, he is used to my way
of living, so I make no apology."</p>

<p>"Apology," said the Count, "de simplitude
of prandationess, is most favourized by me&mdash;both 
in pint of pallatatibility and of salubriment&mdash;de 
stomach of de beings of humanity is not
conformable to de digestation of de objects,
to which admissiveness is exercised at great
dinings."</p>

<p>The Count's principle was quite in accordance

<!-- vol 1 page 309 -->

with my own, and we certainly made sad havoc
with our "innocent lamb;" the wine circulated
freely, and we were all in good spirits. The
dishes were removed, and a second dish attended
as before by a smaller one, made its appearance.
Redmond with his usual dexterity raised the
covers, when my astonished eyes beheld a boiled
leg of lamb in one dish, and a fresh supply of
spinach in the other.</p>

<p>Daly's astonishment, however, did not seem
to be excited; for he inquired if we would take
some boiled lamb, with as much composure as if
he had expected the dish, which it seemed quite
clear to me he did not. The sight, however,
reminded me of a circumstance which occurred
to me once in the west of England, at a house
where I paid an unexpected visit, and where&mdash;as 
one always is in the west of England&mdash;I was
kindly and hospitably received. The family
was a large one, and I the only stranger, I
arrived within a few minutes of dinner, was
ushered to my room, hurried my dressing, and
was speedily seated at table.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 310 -->

<p>The soup was served. It was a remarkably
nice sort of broth, made of veal, with rice and
vegetables&mdash;I applauded it much; at the bottom 
of the table was a roast loin of veal; at
the top, half a calf's head; there were four
<i>entr&eacute;es</i>, yet uncovered. "What will you eat,
Gurney," said the master of the house, "some
of <i>my</i> dish or Maria's?" I doubted. "Hand
round the <i>entr&eacute;es</i>," said the lady; two were
forthwith put in motion&mdash;one dish contained
veal patties, and the other some veal collops&mdash;I 
declined both, for I hated veal; next
came the other two&mdash;one a calf's brains, and the
other a calf's tongue&mdash;I declined those, and took
some of the joint, determining to wait for the
second course.</p>

<p>I saw, however, dish after dish vanish, and I
yet remained unsatisfied; when my fair hostess,
with one of her sweetest smiles, said, "We have
no second course for you, Mr. Gurney; the fact
is, we killed a calf the day before yesterday,
and we are such prudent managers that we
make a point of eating it up while it is good,

<!-- vol 1 page 311 -->

and nice, and fresh, before we begin upon any
thing else," Having had this experience, and
having heard before dinner, that Daly wished
particularly to see "the butcher," I concluded
that my eccentric host in London, like my more
economical one in the country, had purchased a
lamb "for fun," and was now employing us to
eat it up, while it was "good, and nice, and
fresh."</p>

<p>Daly seemed to enjoy the boiled leg quite
as much as he had enjoyed the roast one; and
when he had satisfied his appetite he desired
Redmond to take it away, "and if there was
any second course to bring it."&mdash;"Come,"
thought I, "unlike my precedent of the veal,
we <i>are</i> to have a second course to-day, and all
will be well."</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Redmond made his appearance 
with another couple of dishes; one as
usual, large&mdash;the other small&mdash;they, like their
predecessors, were put down and the covers
removed, when, to my utter astonishment, I
beheld a third leg of lamb and spinach, the

<!-- vol 1 page 312 -->

only variation consisting in the fact that the
lamb was roasted like the first. I could not help
exclaiming, on the appearance of this, because
it put an end to my speculation of Daly's purchase, 
seeing that no lamb,&mdash;except indeed
occasionally as a freak of nature,&mdash;has three
legs; but Daly did not seem either surprised
or discomposed at the exhibition, and the Count&mdash;which 
surprised me most&mdash;seemed equally at
his ease with Daly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't like lamb," said mine
host, "shall I send you some?"</p>

<p>"If you please," said I,&mdash;resolved if it were
done in fun&mdash;for it is impossible to ascertain
when a practical joker is serious&mdash;to keep up
my good temper, and as it seemed a conceded
point, on the part of both my companions, that
nothing more was to be served, I washed down
the third division of innocence with some remarkably 
good Champagne.</p>

<p>To this third edition of lamb, succeeded,
three gooseberry tarts&mdash;all nearly of equal size&mdash;the 
dishes alone differing in shape and fashion

<!-- vol 1 page 313 -->

and when these were discussed, three detachments 
of cheese, and three plates of radishes&mdash;there 
was something quaint and odd in the evident 
affection for the triune number, which
Daly exhibited. However, as we were three at
table, I imagined he had prepared his dinner on
the principle of every man his own dish&mdash;Something 
like the proud Welsh boy at school, who,
hearing that an English Duke employed six
men cooks, during the period that he kept open
house, or rather open castle in the north,
sneered at the alleged magnificence. "<i>My</i> father
does better than that," said Griffith ap Jones, "at
our very last party before I left Cmydrdlmnynddr,
we had twenty-four men cooks all employed
in dressing the supper;"&mdash;and this would have
gone down easily, and Griffith ap Jones would
have established his paternal magnificence for
ever, had not a "Daly of his day" discovered
the real state of the case, and announced to his
school-fellows, that although the Welshman had
spoken truly, the company at the supper to which
he alluded, consisted of twenty-four of his near

<!-- vol 1 page 314 -->

relations, and that <i>every man toasted his own
cheese!</i></p>

<p>I noticed the continued imperturbability of
mine host's countenance, and an occasional look
passing between him and the Count, convinced
me that the circumstance was not accidental;
but while Redmond, the servant, was still in
the room, I did not like to make any enquiry
into the particulars.</p>

<p>"Dis Claret," said the Count, "is butiful&mdash;dere 
is a refreshiness in de coolth of him, which
is gracious to the mouse&mdash;Lafitte, I considere."</p>

<p>"The wine," said Daly, "is good enough in
its way&mdash;but, Gurney, what did you think of
the dinner?&mdash;did it puzzle you?"</p>

<p>"Why," said I&mdash;"it <i>did</i> puzzle me a little&mdash;
I suppose you like lamb?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said Daly&mdash;"but the Count knows
the truth&mdash;so shall you&mdash;I have lost a good deal
of money lately with very little to lose from,
and although my large creditors are full of faith&mdash;the 
lesser ones are suspicious of my resources&mdash;I 
therefore deal with many folks, each

<!-- vol 1 page 315 -->

in a small way, and the tavern-keeper from
whom I always get my little dinners at home,
suggested that, as I was a good deal in arrear,
he should be obliged to confine his confidence
in me to the extent of one dish per diem,
when I wanted it. Now one dish not being sufficient 
for three persons, I immediately entered
into a similar treaty with two other tavern-keepers 
in the neighbourhood, who are equally
willing to trust me to a similar amount&mdash;they
were all three put in requisition to-day; and
as legs of lamb, roast or boiled, are just now in
season, each of the fellows sent me the popular
dish; thinking, I suppose, that as I was to have
but one, I ought to have as well as a fashionable,
a somewhat substantial one."</p>

<p>A new light burst in upon me; and although
it was impossible not to join in the laugh in
which mine host and his friend were indulging,
the fact which had been elicited, accounted to me
for the readiness with which Daly had enlisted
in my service in the Tenby expedition, and his
willingness to undertake the widow, at half price,

<!-- vol 1 page 316 -->

whose reduced jointure would afford him a very
snug retirement. During the time we remained
drinking our wine, several circumstances occurred 
to induce me to believe that the Count's
diplomatic character at our court was, at best,
but an equivocal one; and others in connection
with this, led me, in some degree, to regret that
I had permitted Daly's agreeable manners to give
him the ascendancy over me which I felt conscious 
he possessed, and to extract from me the
secret of my attachment to Emma. I anticipated
the mischief which his introduction into her family 
might eventually produce, when it should
be known that it was at my suggestion he presented 
himself there; and moreover, I felt that
it would be extremely unfair in me to aid and
abet an alliance between him and the widow, for
entering into which, he could have none but
interested views, the realization of which would
probably entail upon the elder lady a <i>rou&eacute;</i> husband,
and upon the younger one, a giddy father-in-law&mdash;but 
what was to be done, the plan had been
mentioned, we had discussed it during the early

<!-- vol 1 page 317 -->

part of the day, the horses, I knew, were ordered,
or at least, a place in the coach was taken; and if
I hesitated or interposed at this period, so shortly
before the opening of the campaign, and so
soon after the disclosure of the real state of
mine host's finances, I should in all probability
have been handed over to the tender mercies of
the noble Count, who before noon the next day
would have exhibited, at my personal expence,
"the perfectability of his completiveness in the
art of pistolization."</p>

<p>It was, I admit, with no little uneasiness that
I heard Daly give directions to Redmond to
have all his luggage ready for an early start in
the morning; yet how could I check the impulse
of a genuine and generous friendship&mdash;his want
of wealth arose from no fault of his, or even if it
did, it might result from the faults of liberality,
and a carelessness of worldly affairs, I therefore
said nothing, although I would have given the
world to delay his departure for a day or two.</p>

<p>It was growing late, when Daly suggested
the necessity of preparing for action&mdash;the Count

<!-- vol 1 page 318 -->

was to appear in a splendid military uniform,
upon which glittered several decorations, and in
which he was to attire himself after Daly had
finished his neckcloth, which, in the later part
of the evening was to adorn his proper person.
I was accommodated with a fancy domino, and
thus we were to proceed to Wolverhampton
House, where, as I understood, Daly had been
before dinner, aiding and assisting the Countess
in various proceedings for the evening's display.</p>

<p>I concluded, after I received this intelligence,
that he had abandoned his design of physicking
her Ladyship's friends with his macaroon cakes,
and when he sallied forth from the adjoining
apartment, in a sort of foreign dress, extremely
well disguised, I imagined him prepared to
enchant the misses as a minstrel, and win their
willing ears with melodies such as he was fully
capable of warbling&mdash;an idea which was strengthened, 
when Redmond gave him, carefully enveloped 
in green baize, what I fondly imagined
to be a guitar.</p>

<p>The Count, who looked very magnificently,

<!-- vol 1 page 319 -->

wore no mask, but trusted to his natural
personal appearance to make his way, and,
although somewhat upon too large a scale for
a lady-killer, I fancied him a likely enough
man to delight the dowagers. It was considerably 
past twelve before we were fairly under
way&mdash;we were each armed with a ticket of
admission, which Daly informed me her Ladyship 
very much preferred to any other mode of
invitation, upon such an occasion as that of to-night&mdash;the 
great merit of a masquerade being
the mystery, which would of course be utterly
destroyed, if the guests were compelled to show
themselves, in order to obtain the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>&mdash;Redmond, 
I observed put into the coach two or
three bundles, which I presumed contained
changes of dress for his volatile versatile master,
and thus buttoned up, away we drove to the
temple of gaiety, of beauty, and fashion.</p>

<p>When we approached the mansion, a string of
carriages checked our advance,&mdash;noise and confusion 
were heard on every side&mdash;the lashing of
coachmen's whips&mdash;the loud bawling of constables 

<!-- vol 1 page 320 -->

and Bow Street officers&mdash;the laughs of the
congregated groups, as some grotesque character 
stepped across the <i>trottoir</i> into the house,
the distant clang of cymbals, and the beat of
drums, which came wafted on the air from her
Ladyship's hall, all combined to whet the appetite 
for action, and it seemed an hour before we
found our worthy No. 225 opposite the entrance
to the mad scene of brilliancy and fun. Out I
stepped&mdash;I created no visible sensation amongst
the throng&mdash;the Baron's red morocco boots, and
gold-seamed pantaloons, his much embroidered
jacket, and his dangling crosses, seemed to
excite a reverential awe; but when Daly stepped 
forth with his beard and bundle, which
much to my horror developed itself, not as I
expected, in the shape of a guitar, but in the
more dreaded form of a basket full of "macaroon 
cakes," the surrounding crowd cried out,
"Moses, give us a cake,"&mdash;"I say. Mosey,"
and indeed diverted themselves so much at his
expense, that I almost wondered he did not
favour them with a taste of his stock.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 321 -->

<p>If the confusion outside the house were great,
inconceivably greater was that within&mdash;little did
I then suspect the immediate cause of it&mdash;Daly
had told me (I thought as a joke), that our noble
hostess proposed having a cow, deposited in a sort
of arbour at the top of the first flight of stairs, in
which one of the sweetest girls that ever lived,
was to be discovered in the costume of a milk-maid, 
supposed to be employed in her rustic
vocation, while the company were to be perpetually 
refreshed with syllabubs, imaginatively
concocted from the produce of her toil.</p>

<p>When we reached the hall, we might as well
have had no tickets; we found all the servants,
and several of the male visitors engaged in one
general action&mdash;screams above were responded
to by shouts below, in the midst of which I
observed two butchers, in their ordinary costume,
assiduously employed in the divided task of coaxing 
and kicking a huge bullock down the flight
of stairs, at the top of which was the dairy-maid's
bower&mdash;the more they roared, the more they
coaxed, and the more they kicked, the less would

<!-- vol 1 page 322 -->

the bullock stir, and it was not until the greatest
skill, judgment, and magnanimity had been displayed, 
that the vast monster was got out of the
street-door; when, as if angry at being expelled
a scene where everything else was <i>in</i> character,
and therefore <i>out of it</i>, he made a sudden dash
amongst the horses and carriages, to the infinite
peril of panes, panels, poles, perches, and
platforms.</p>

<p>"Isn't that good fun," said Daly to me:&mdash;"now 
come along&mdash;this is the time for the
macaroons&mdash;'the labour we delight in physics
pain;'&mdash;see&mdash;watch&mdash;and mark the sequel."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I followed my friend up the staircase, the
Count having already fallen into conversation
with a very beautiful, but immense lady, to
whom I was afterwards introduced, and had
much occasion to admire and pity&mdash;we proceeded 
to the drawing-room&mdash;where a circle was
formed round Lady Wolverhampton, who was
expatiating in no measured terms upon the
infamous conduct of the man who had promised
to send her a nice elegant lady-like cow to stand

<!-- vol 1 page 323 -->

Hermione-like in the glass-case by the side of
the lovely milk-maid, but who, instead, had with
great labour and difficulty squeezed a huge
overfed bullock into the place. The moment I
heard the dear Countess telling her story, a
thought flashed across me&mdash;the butcher, to see
whom Daly had been so anxious before dinner,
was no doubt the traitorous cause of the mishap
under the malign influence of the practical
joker.</p>

<p>The scene was beautiful and gay&mdash;the variety
of masks&mdash;the diversity of costume&mdash;the boisterous 
mirth of the Moll Flaggons, and Irish
haymakers, flirting with delicate die-away
Nuns, and aristocratic flower girls&mdash;fat monks,
dancing with Swiss peasants&mdash;knights in armour,
lounging on sofas with Indian queens&mdash;Doctor
Ollapod, in close conversation with Alexander 
the Great, and Caleb Quotem, seriously
arguing a point of etiquette with Henry the
Fourth of France. It was all exceedingly fascinating 
and intoxicating, and the bull having
been disposed of, harmony was restored&mdash;disturbed 

<!-- vol 1 page 324 -->

only by a shrill cry of "macaroons&mdash;cakes&mdash;cakes&mdash;macaroons&mdash;who'll 
buy?&mdash;who'll
buy?" I saw the fiend of fun approach. In an
instant, as he had anticipated, an attack was
made upon his basket&mdash;and every body who wore
a mask, in which eating was practicable, began
consuming the fruits of their impetuosity. I
dreaded the consequences, not only to the sufferers, 
but to Daly himself, who, if discovered,
would of course be subject to all the serious
penalties which such a trick must naturally entail
upon him. Scarcely, however, had the distribution 
taken place (long before the sickening
effects could show themselves) when I felt a
sudden twitch at my elbow&mdash;I looked round,
and saw a Spanish Grandee close at my side. I
was startled! I had never visited a masquerade
before. "Who are <i>you?</i>" said I. "All the
cakes are gone," whispered the mask; "so is
the basket and cloak&mdash;I'm here:"&mdash;it was of
course Daly. "Come with me," said he; "I
will introduce you to Lady Wolverhampton;&mdash;it
is quite prudent to do so. She will see <i>my</i> dress

<!-- vol 1 page 325 -->

and yours, and then she can't suspect either of
<i>us</i> of being the macaroon cake-seller;&mdash;take care
and ingratiate yourself&mdash;make yourself amiable&mdash;she's 
as hospitable as an Arab, and not
very unlike one&mdash;hem!"&mdash;I followed him, and
found myself in a moment at the side of the
Countess.</p>

<p>"Countess," said he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said her Ladyship.</p>

<p>"Mufti," whispered Daly.</p>

<p>"What, so smart, Daly!" said she: (Mufti
being the mystic word by which he made himself 
known)&mdash;"a Grandee?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Daly. "This is my friend
Gurney, of whom I have spoken&mdash;agreeable
creature&mdash;sings like a syren&mdash;talks like a magpie&mdash;quite 
delightful."</p>

<p>"And I am delighted to make his acquaintance," 
said her Ladyship&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>"Unmask for a moment," said Daly; "let
the Countess see the 'human face divine,' else
when her Ladyship invites you to meet me at

<!-- vol 1 page 326 -->

dinner here next Tuesday week, at seven
o'clock, she may perhaps be disappointed."</p>

<p>"Don't mind him, Mr. Gurney," said her
Ladyship; "I shall be very glad to see you
whenever you will do me the kindness to call.
But, Daly, now tell me&mdash;had you no hand in
the business of the bullock?"</p>

<p>"Bullock!" said Daly. "I! My dear
Lady."</p>

<p>Hereabouts, the room began to thin&mdash;the
dancers seemed particularly anxious to get fresh
air&mdash;several persons were seen evidently much
disordered, and the whole corps appeared in
confusion.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" said Lady Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>"I don't know, my dear Countess," said a
very respectable old body, with a turban on her
head; "but Kate and Fanny are both taken
unaccountably ill, and so is Lieutenant Griggs
of the Life Guards, who was dancing with one
of them, and as for poor Lady Elizabeth Grogan, 
I believe she is dying."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 327 -->

<p>A new confusion here arose&mdash;the macaroons
were evidently disagreeing with the company;
however, only a small portion had been poisoned, 
and to my delight, I found that although
a good many of both sexes were considerably
damaged by their own anxiety to eat the things,
there was still a magnificent crowd to carry on
the affairs of the evening. In the midst of the
<i>embarras</i>, which to the hostess was of course inexplicable, 
the arrival of a Prince of the blood
Royal, who came unmasked, gave a new
zest to the scene, and the delight which the
Countess experienced at his appearance, rendered 
her wholly insensible to the indisposition
of her numerous guests, who were labouring
under the effects of her pet's performances.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the Countess had entered 
into conversation with his Royal Highness,
who had seated himself on an ottoman in a small
circular room, and while he was graciously complimenting 
the beauty of the scene, the candles
by which it was lighted, began almost simultaneously 
to perform of themselves an operation

<!-- vol 1 page 328 -->

called "guttering down," and then go out, with a
sort of unsatisfactory splash of wax. The result
was, a nearly total eclipse, attended by an extremely 
unpleasant smell. Poor Lady Wolverhampton, 
who confided in Daly, called him to
her, and mourning this new calamity, begged
him to order fresh lights, which, with an air of
subservient activity, he immediately did; but as
he went, he whispered me to suggest to her Ladyship 
the expediency of burning some sort of perfume 
in the room. The idea was instantly adopted
by her Ladyship, who, directing me to a beautiful
fillagree box which lay on one of the tables,
requested me to put three or four of the pastilles, 
which it contained, into a burner on the
chimney-piece. I obeyed her Ladyship's orders,
and the instant I set light to them they exploded, 
and continued flashing and snapping
and blazing till they were entirely burned out,
being neither more nor less than four "devils"
or "wild-fires," such as we were in the habit of
making at school, and which, looking precisely
like pastilles, some mischievous elf had deposited 

<!-- vol 1 page 329 -->

there instead of the real article. The
result was, considerable alarm&mdash;an abominable
smell, and a smoke so thick that his Royal
Highness was seized with a desperate fit of
coughing, and all the windows were thrown
open to dissipate the obscurity.</p>

<p>The moment the devils took fire, I was convinced 
that Daly was the author of this affair, as
well as of all the others&mdash;that he had made
the exchange, and set me upon making the
proposition, in order to bring his scheme into
play. However, the rooms were refreshed&mdash;new 
candles were brought, things resumed their
wonted gaiety, and Daly made his re-appearance.</p>

<p>I ought, perhaps, here to observe, that along
the principal drawing room, a canal, some two
or three feet deep, had been constructed, with
an embankment of moss, and coral, and shells,
in which the much talked-of fish were destined to
desport themselves, but by the time we got there,
their swimming had entirely ceased&mdash;Daly had
dosed them with Coculus Indicus just before
he left the house in the afternoon, and when we

<!-- vol 1 page 330 -->

arrived at night they were all floating on their
backs, dead drunk from the effects of the deleterious 
drug.</p>

<p>It was now nearly two; and I&mdash;strange to say&mdash;felt 
very much disposed for supper. I asked
my Mentor whether such a meal was probable.</p>

<p>"Supper!" said Daly; "to be sure&mdash;it is
the point of the epigram; the sugar after the
physic&mdash;all regular sit down; hot soups&mdash;snug
flirtations and fun! none of your stand up
absurdities,&mdash;tables against the wall, covered
with cold negus, and warm ice; where men,
women, and children take perpendicular refreshment, 
like so many horses with their noses
in the manger&mdash;no!&mdash;trust to me&mdash;we shall
unmask at supper. I'll introduce you to something 
very charming, only do me the favour
not to forget Emma, and <i>the</i> twenty thousand
pounds&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>One of the bands here struck up, "the Roast
Beef of Old England," as a signal that the
much desired banquet was ready; and accordingly 
every eye sparkled, every heart beat,
every body rushed forward, regardless of order,

<!-- vol 1 page 331 -->

decorum, or decency, in the grand attack upon
the Countess's refection. The Countess, however,
having made proper arrangements, and knowing 
the eagerness of the best bred people upon
this particular subject, had desired her house-steward 
to complete all the preparations for the
supper destined for his Royal Highness and his
select party, in the circular tent-room, immediately 
under the one in which he had been sitting,
and where covers were laid for twenty; and as soon
as all was ready, to bring her the key of the door,
so that when she led the Prince to the tent, she
might open the little paradise to his view, and
be sure that nobody else could make an attack
upon the <i>sanctum</i>. According to order, everything 
was arranged, the tent lighted, and the
key brought, the soups alone being to be served
after the <i>&eacute;lite</i> had taken their places.</p>

<p>The rush and squeeze began&mdash;and just in the
whirlpool of beauty and grace and elegance, I
saw a lady, whose laughing eyes, and sweet
expression of countenance delighted me, while
she and another, somewhat younger than herself, 

<!-- vol 1 page 332 -->

were tossed to and fro in the eddying
crowd&mdash;they had unmasked, and their dresses
were exceedingly becoming to their pretty and
animated countenances, and I asked Daly who
the elder of the two was?</p>

<p>"Just the woman for you to know!" said
he. "She is perfectly delightful, gives the
most agreeable parties in London;&mdash;amiable,
clever, agreeable, with a hundred thousand
pounds of her own:&mdash;make her acquaintance by
all means!" saying which, we squeezed towards
them. "Mrs. Fletcher Green," said he; "permit 
me to present my friend Mr. Gurney,
who is anxious to become your cavalier in this
dreadful onset."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks," said Mrs. Fletcher
Green.</p>

<p>"I will take care of Lady John," added he;
and in one instant a wave of humanity separated
us, and I found myself obliged, in self-preservation, 
and for the preservation of Mrs. Fletcher
Green, to take an opposite course, by which we
secured our places at a table, whence we could

<!-- vol 1 page 333 -->

not even see my new friend's late companion, or
Daly. It did not seem to signify much&mdash;Mrs.
Fletcher Green appeared perfectly happy where
she was&mdash;so was I&mdash;and we began a conversation 
of the most agreeable character, which grew
livelier as the champagne circulated, and commenced 
on that night, an acquaintance, the
termination of which I most assuredly did not
contemplate at the time.</p>

<p>Another dreadful mishap had occurred since
we quitted the drawing-rooms, of which intelligence 
was brought us by common report; by
which it really seemed as if Lady Wolverhampton 
had been that night marked out for the sport
of fortune. The Countess, as it had been arranged, 
conducted the Prince to the tent room&mdash;his 
Royal Highness giving her Ladyship his
arm, and leading the noble guests who had
been favored with a command to join the royal
party. Arrived at the door of the pavilion, her
Ladyship applied the key, the lock willingly
obeyed the appeal, the <i>battants</i> flew open, and
disclosed the splendid supper service of the late
Earl, making the circular table groan with its

<!-- vol 1 page 334 -->

weight, and dazzling the eye with its magnificence; 
but what were the Countess's feelings,
when she beheld nothing in the golden dishes
and vases but the remnants of a devoured
feast&mdash;fragments of dissected fowls&mdash;ends of
well notched tongues&mdash;creams half demolished&mdash;jellies 
in trembling lumps&mdash;glasses scarce
emptied, and bottles emptied quite&mdash;crusts of
bread, with heads and tails of prawns scattered
about upon the snowy cloth, and plates well
used piled upon each other in the middle of
the once festive board!</p>

<p>The confusion of the Countess was beyond
description&mdash;the laughter of the Prince beyond
belief&mdash;to him it was a capital joke&mdash;to her
Ladyship, a serious evil: how it had occurred
nobody could guess, for the door had been locked
the moment everything was ready, and the key
taken to her Ladyship. Consternation reigned,
and his Royal Highness had to re-ascend the
stairs, and wait until the whole affair was re-arranged. 
Of course, I was as ignorant as my
neighbours of the cause of this calamity, and
should have remained so until now, had not

<!-- vol 1 page 335 -->

Daly told me, in our way home, that having
gone out into the garden, in order to get rid of
his Jew's dress and basket, where he deposited
them, he found a band of Pandean Minstrels,
puffing their hearts out into their pipes, to which
nobody listened, and being resolved, if possible,
to destroy the royal monopoly in the tent-room,
to which he had not been invited, and which,
although locked towards the lobby, opened on to
the lawn, he directed the weary performers to
go in at the window, which he set wide for the
purpose, and get their supper; advising them
by no means to call for anything that was not
there already&mdash;to eat and drink what they could,
and to make as much haste as possible, and when
they had done, to lock the window on the outside, 
and throw the key into the four yards
square pond, which in rainy weather served as
a wet dock for the Countess' pet swan. All of
which instructions, it appeared, the said Pandeans 
followed to the very letter; and thus, to
his infinite delight, caused that confusion, in
which his heart so wonderfully rejoiced.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 336 -->

<p>It was nearly five when I handed Mrs.
Fletcher Green into her dark brown chariot.
I ventured to express some solicitude about her
companion at the supper-room door, till she
assured me that she was quite safe; "because,"
said she, "she has a husband here to take care
of her. I am quite independent&mdash;a thousand
thanks&mdash;I hope we shall be better acquainted."</p>

<p>Away she drove&mdash;I turned into the house to
look for Daly&mdash;but I confess Mrs. Fletcher
Green had made an impression upon me&mdash;there 
was such a charming mixture of worldliness 
and nature about her&mdash;I mean such a perfect 
knowledge of every body in society, and of
every thing that was going on, mixed with a
genuine kind-heartedness&mdash;a love of fun&mdash;and
an artless hearty good nature, all of which
combined with talent of a high order, and accomplishments 
which even my short intercourse
with her had convinced me were of the first
class, rendered her engaging&mdash;interesting&mdash;captivating.</p>

<p>When I went up stairs to look for my friend,

<!-- vol 1 page 337 -->

the sun had superseded the lamps and candles&mdash;the 
decorations of the preceding night had lost
their freshness; even the flowers seemed to droop&mdash;the 
lovely girls looked haggard, and the elderly
ladies horrid&mdash;the rouge burnt blue on their
cheeks, and there was not a curl in the whole
community. Masks and character-dresses lay
heaped in corners, disregarded; and people,
in their own proper persons, were languidly
praising the humours and delights of the party,
listening, listlessly, for the announcement of the
carriages which were to take them away;&mdash;the
vapour of tea and coffee, which were served,
were the only refreshments of the <i>fl&eacute;tri</i> scene,
if I except the morning air, which some of the
most venturous of the girls dared to admit
through the open windows, <i>malgr&eacute;</i> the warning
of their prudent mothers.</p>

<p>I soon found Daly, and we retired together&mdash;my 
head aching&mdash;my heart not easy&mdash;tired&mdash;worn 
out&mdash;and as much fatigued as if I had
travelled a journey of two hundred miles. All
the consolation I derived from my own sensations 

<!-- vol 1 page 338 -->

was, the hope that my friend would
be equally knocked up with myself, and would,
therefore, delay his departure for Tenby, for at
least another day.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I awoke in the morning&mdash;or I should
say afternoon, since it was considerably past
twelve before I opened my eyes&mdash;all the proceedings 
at Wolverhampton House appeared
like a dream. The audacity of Daly&mdash;the mischief 
he had committed upon a kind and confiding 
friend who apparently did all she could
to make him welcome and happy, seemed too
gross and glaring to be real; and it was not
until I saw on the table by my bed-side, a rose
which had graced the bosom of the charming

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

Mrs. Fletcher Green, that I was assured that I
had really seen a bull on a staircase, and heard
of the Pandean minstrels eating the Prince's
supper in the Pavilion. I had carefully placed
the half-faded flower in a glass of water, and
greatly rejoiced to see it look refreshed by my
delicate attention.</p>

<p>I admit, however, that a reproachful feeling
diffused itself over my mind, when I recollected 
under what very peculiar circumstances
I had half taken and half received this precious
bud from my charming new acquaintance. I had
treasured the gift&mdash;if gift it had been&mdash;and
placed it at my bed-side on the very morning
that my kind and active friend had undertaken
to work my eternal happiness by a marriage
with my dear unsophisticated Emma Haines.&mdash;But 
what then? Mrs. Fletcher Green was
only an acquaintance&mdash;a very delightful one&mdash;much 
Emma's senior. I thought her indeed
rather advanced in life&mdash;I being just one and
twenty; and she, as I afterwards had occasion
to know, three years under thirty. But so

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

completely are our judgments and opinions,
especially in that particular, regulated by comparison, 
that I felt a kind of respect for her
age mingled with my admiration of her accomplishments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher Green was evidently pleased
with <i>me</i>, and <i>that</i>, as everybody must admit,
was a very powerful reason for my being
charmed with <i>her</i>, I was determined to call
upon her, and improve the acquaintance; and,
strange to say, I almost hoped that Daly had
not got so far the start of me in rising as to
be on his way to Tenby to open the negotiations 
with the Haineses. It was not that Mrs.
Fletcher Green had entirely superseded Emma
in so short a time, or that she had carried my
heart by a <i>coup de main</i>, but she was so graceful, 
so polished, so agreeable, knew everybody,
and everything about everybody; and was so
exquisitely good-tempered, and had such eyes!
I believe a heart just of age was never proverbial 
for constancy; yet there was a striking
difference between my feelings towards the fair

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

widow and those which bound me to my first
love&mdash;I cannot conveniently describe the dissimilitude, 
but I was conscious of it, and yet
equally conscious that I ought not to be so
much interested about one lady, when on the
very point of concluding a negotiation, if possible, 
with another.</p>

<p>When I called at Daly's lodgings, I found
the bird flown. He had indeed afforded me a
new and remarkable proof of the activity of
his friendship. He had started, as his servant
told me, before eight, after little more than an
hour's sleep. He had left a note, in which he
desired me to confide in his judgment and discretion, 
and informed me that he would write
to report progress the moment any progress had
been made. His servant appeared particularly
solicitous to know when I expected his master
back; and his anxiety seemed to me scarcely
equal to that of a half gentlemanly looking man
whom I found at the door in conversation with
Redmond, who held a longish slip of paper in
his hand, which after my sincere declaration

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

that I had no notion how long he would be
out of town, he returned to a long black book
which he had previously carried under his arm,
and which now that the paper was replaced
within its folds, he deposited in a pocket made
in the inside of one of the lapels of his coat.</p>

<p>I had become so accustomed to the society
and conversation of my volatile friend, that
when I turned from his lodgings I felt as if
I had lost part of myself now that I was left
alone. I strolled along the streets as far as
Wolverhampton House, where I left my ticket,
and afterwards sauntered down what was then
imagined to be <i>the</i> promenade of London, Bond
Street&mdash;the utter destruction of which as a
fashionable lounge by the splendid creation of
Regent Street, or any other possible cause, none
of the beaux of those days even remotely anticipated. 
Still I felt dull and <i>distrait;</i> and
when after having descended the hill of St.
James's Street, and passed half way along Pall
Mall, I recognized a friend of my theatrical
M&aelig;cenas, coming out of an auction room,

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

where an extensive book sale was going on,
I was quite delighted! I scarcely expected,
as I had abandoned dramatic literature, and
absented myself from the Thespian votaries,
that he would recognize me! On the contrary,
his plump rosy cheeks, purpled with warmth
and kindness, as he held out his hand to take
mine, and protested that I was the very man
he wanted most particularly to see.</p>

<p>Hull&mdash;for so was my warm-hearted friend
called&mdash;was a very extraordinary person. He
knew the business of everybody in London
better than the people themselves. He happened 
to know everything that was going forward 
in all circles&mdash;mercantile, political, fashionable, 
literary, or theatrical; in addition to all
matters connected with military and naval affairs, 
agriculture, finance, art and science&mdash;everything 
came alike to him&mdash;to <i>his</i> inquiring
eye no mystery continued undiscovered;&mdash;from
his attentive ear no secret remained concealed.
He was plump&mdash;short&mdash;with an intelligent countenance, 
and near-sighted&mdash;with a constitution

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

and complexion fresh enough to look forty,
at a time when <i>I</i> believed him to be at least
four times the age;&mdash;we had a joke against him,
in those days, as to his antiquity, in which he
heartily and good-naturedly joined, until at last
we got him to admit&mdash;and I almost think, believe&mdash;that 
he had sold gunpowder to King
Charles the Second, and dined more than once
with the witty Lord Rochester.</p>

<p>"Wanted to see me?" said I&mdash;"as how?"</p>

<p>"Wanted you to come and meet a few friends
at my cottage at Mitcham," said Hull&mdash;"all
plain and simple&mdash;good wine, I promise you,
and pleasant company&mdash;but you are such a
fellow, my dear friend. Pooh, pooh! don't
tell me&mdash;there's no catching you&mdash;eh, I say&mdash;I 
have heard all about the cakes, the cow
and the Countess, the Pandeans in the pavilion,
and the dead dace in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said I&mdash;not imagining 
it possible that events which had so recently 
occurred, should have already obtained
such publicity.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

<p>"O you dog," said Hull&mdash;"<i>I</i> happen to know&mdash;my 
dear Gurney&mdash;it's no use trying to hoax
me&mdash;I say&mdash;Daly did it&mdash;he, he!&mdash;you know
it&mdash;eh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not I, upon my honour," said I; which was
true&mdash;"do you know Daly?"</p>

<p>"Know him!"&mdash;exclaimed my friend&mdash;"know
Daly!&mdash;why, my dear Sir, I have known him
these forty years!"</p>

<p>"Daly!" said I, "why he is not thirty years
old!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not forty," said Hull; "but I knew
his father more than forty years ago&mdash;lived in
St. Mary Axe&mdash;in the sugar line&mdash;dead, now&mdash;Daly, 
your friend is a deuce of a fellow&mdash;you
dined with him yesterday at his lodgings?"</p>

<p>"I did," said I, staring&mdash;"but how did you
find <i>that</i> out?"</p>

<p>"Find it out, my dear friend!" replied Hull,
"I do nothing in the world but find out&mdash;I saw
the boiled leg of lamb and spinach which you
had for dinner&mdash;eh&mdash;wasn't it so?"</p>

<p>I knew that unless he had been in three

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

places at once, he could not have seen all our
legs of lamb; so I contented myself with admitting 
what I had no desire to deny.</p>

<p>"Splendid fellow, Daly," said Hull&mdash;"capital 
hock he has got."</p>

<p>"Do you dine with him frequently?" said I.</p>

<p>"Never, my dear friend; never dined with
him in my life," said Hull; "but I know where
he gets his hock&mdash;six guineas and a half the
dozen&mdash;come down to Mitcham, you shall taste
some of the very same batch. Great creature,
Daly&mdash;magnificent style, I'm told&mdash;splendid
service of plate, and all that."</p>

<p>"Plate!" said I.</p>

<p>"Superb," said Hull&mdash;"I happen to know
the fact."</p>

<p>"My dear Sir," said I, "I should say, a
dozen spoons and forks were the extent of his
service, as you call it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hull, "what does he want
with more? Too bad&mdash;the cakes&mdash;eh&mdash;and
the cow&mdash;all over Town. However, now to
business, as I have done work for to-day&mdash;when 

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

will you come to Mitcham&mdash;name your
time?"</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy," said I&mdash;"but what
do you mean by having done work?"</p>

<p>"Here," said he, drawing from one of his
pockets a very small dirty black-letter book&mdash;"this 
is all I shall do to-day&mdash;my pursuit, you
know&mdash;eh&mdash;old books&mdash;rare books&mdash;I don't care
what I give so as I can secure them&mdash;this is a
tract of 1486&mdash;seventeen pages originally&mdash;five
only wanting&mdash;two damaged&mdash;got it for seventy-two 
pounds ten shillings&mdash;Caxton&mdash;only
one other copy extant&mdash;that in the British
Museum."</p>

<p>"Seventy-two pounds for <i>that!</i>" said I.</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Hull&mdash;"why, my dear
Sir, it is not worth <i>my</i> while to come out of
the city unless I spend seventy or eighty
pounds in the morning&mdash;I cannot afford the
time for less."</p>

<p>"And what is it about?" said I, innocently.</p>

<p>"Why, I do <i>not</i> happen to know <i>that</i>," said
Hull&mdash;"it is an essay, I believe, to prove that

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

Edward the Fourth never had the tooth-ache;
but it is, as you see, in Latin, and I don't read
Latin."</p>

<p>"Then why buy it?" said I.</p>

<p>"Buy!" exclaimed he, looking at me through
his glass with an expression of astonishment&mdash;"I 
buy thousands of books!&mdash;pooh! pooh!
millions, my dear Sir, in the course of a year,
but I never think of reading them&mdash;my dear
friend, I have no time to read."</p>

<p>I confess I did not exactly comprehend the
character of the bibliomania which appeared to
engross my friend, nor the particular gratification
which the purchase of the unreadable works
seemed to afford him. But he only curled up
his mouth, as much as to say that I was a
dunce, and that there was a sort of delight&mdash;felt 
in common with magpies, I presume&mdash;of
picking up objects and hiding them away in
dark holes and corners. As for his hospitable
invitation, I resolved to accept it, and fix an
early day&mdash;it would kill some of the time I
was destined to pass in suspense until I heard

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

from Tenby; and give me an opportunity of
cultivating the acquaintance of one who, with
certain little peculiarities, evidently possessed
a sound judgment, and therefore a cheerful
and liberal disposition, and above all, a kind
heart.</p>

<p>"Mine is but a box," said Hull, "all humble
and lowly&mdash;there will be a bed for you at the
inn, and a garden full of gooseberries and currants 
to stroll about."</p>

<p>"And pleasant pastime, too," said I. "I,
for one think the despised fruits of our country,
are amongst the most delicious."</p>

<p>"Despised!" said Hull&mdash;"pooh! pooh! nobody 
can despise gooseberries and currants like
mine&mdash;I have thousands of them!&mdash;pooh! pooh!
currants as big as marbles! and gooseberries
larger than hens' eggs!"</p>

<p>"I'll try them, depend upon it," said I&mdash;"what 
say you to to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"My dear friend, the very day I was going
to fix," said Hull&mdash;"I knew your friend Daly
was gone&mdash;went out of Town by eight this

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

morning&mdash;eh&mdash;come down to Mitcham&mdash;you'll
meet one of your Haymarket friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, "Mr. Hull, that's a sore point&mdash;that 
infernal farce of mine&mdash;I shall never get
over it."</p>

<p>"Infernal!" said Hull&mdash;"what d'ye mean
by infernal?&mdash;I wish we had more people who
could write such farces&mdash;infernal indeed."</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, "it was condemned."</p>

<p>"Umph," said Hull, lowering his voice, and
whispering in my ear, "I could tell you something 
about <i>that</i>&mdash;I happen to know&mdash;and so
do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't," said I.</p>

<p>"Don't you know something about the 'Wag
in the Windmill,' " said Hull, "coming out
the week after next?"</p>

<p>"Not I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! don't tell me," said Hull&mdash;"I 
happen to know the author."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said I, "I don't."</p>

<p>"Come come, you dog, that won't do," said
he; "what does the Chronicle mean the day

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

before yesterday&mdash;did you see the allusion?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, "I never see the Chronicle."</p>

<p>"Never see the Chronicle!" exclaimed Hull,
"don't tell me&mdash;that won't do&mdash;you see <span class="smcap">all</span> the
papers. My dear friend, the allusion to <i>you</i> is
plain as a pikestaff."</p>

<p>"I give you my word," said I, "that I have
written not one line since my failure, nor ever
will write again."</p>

<p>"How could they have got hold of it, I wonder," 
said Hull, archly. "I'll find out before I go
into the city. However, to-morrow you come to
me&mdash;dine punctually at five&mdash;early folks in the
country&mdash;none of your supper-time dinners there&mdash;remember, 
a bed for yourself&mdash;capital stables
for your horses at the inn&mdash;civil people&mdash;very
attentive to all <i>my</i> guests&mdash;know it would not
do if they were not&mdash;hundreds of people go
there in the course of the summer from my
cottage. Good day&mdash;good day&mdash;you won't come
any farther with me, I know you won't&mdash;city

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

work don't suit you&mdash;God bless you&mdash;pooh!
pooh!&mdash;remember five!"</p>

<p>And away he went, leaving me amazed at
the activity of his mind and the universality of
his information. I was vexed to find that I
was coupled with a new authorship, and turned
into the first coffee-house I came near in order
to read the paragraph of which, according to
Hull's declaration, I was the object. In doing
this, I had a double purpose&mdash;first, to see how
I was pointed out to the public; and secondly,
if the identification were very complete, to
write a letter to the Morning Chronicle, contradicting 
the statement; being at that period
of my life perfectly ignorant of the utter carelessness 
of society about such affairs in general,
and about me or any of my concerns more particularly; 
and also then unconvinced that a
reply to a newspaper attack resembles very
much the attempt of Hercules to crop the
Hydra, without the slightest chance of his ultimate 
success; or to descend rapidly from
the sublime, like the task of the tinker, who

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

in trying to stop one hole, invariably makes
two.</p>

<p>I accordingly turned to the paper, and found
that the paragraph was one of those "we understands," 
which so frequently crowd the
columns of the daily journals, and hinting
more ambiguously than even I had expected,
that the author of the forthcoming "Wag in
the Windmill," although unsuccessful in his
first attempt, had every chance of making
ample amends for his early defeat, in his new
production. It was evidently meant good-naturedly, 
and I laid down the Chronicle, wondering 
who in the world could have taken the
trouble to vindicate my presumed effort; little
suspecting that my omniscient friend Hull was
himself the author of the paragraph, which he
had no doubt believed would greatly please me,
and contribute to heal the wounds which a
public verdict had inflicted upon my personal
vanity. As my acquaintance with Hull increased
in age, I had many opportunities of convincing
myself of the inherent kindness of his disposition, 

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

and his readiness to do what he imagined
to be a service to his friends whenever it lay in
his power.</p>

<p>I confess I was very glad I had met him,
and made an engagement to visit him&mdash;for
my mind was distracted, and my heart almost
ached with anxiety as to the result of Daly's
expedition; and those who have felt as I did
then, will readily admit that new scenes and
new acquaintances are, of all things in the
world, most desirable under circumstances, where
there exists a wish or even a hope of distancing
thoughts and reflections which are inevitably
associated with persons whom we have known
and places which we have visited, while in the
society of the loved and lamented one, absent
only from the sight, but present always to the
imagination.</p>

<p>Strange to say, after quitting Hull, I almost
immediately encountered my con-disciple of
Lincoln's Inn on his return homewards from
plodding, to which it appeared he had become

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

infinitely more reconciled since he had lost his
sympathetic friend&mdash;myself.</p>

<p>To a man really mixing in the world, in the
habit of constant intercourse with the principal
actors on the stage&mdash;not of the theatre&mdash;but
of real life: men who by their position in
society, their personal rank, or official importance, 
are in fact the objects of daily contemplation 
and discussion to the eyes of those not
so circumstanced, nothing in the world can be
so dull and ridiculous as the speculative conversations 
of the respectable portion of society
who blending with personal importance in their
own sphere, great acuteness of mind, pertinacity 
of opinion, and inquisitiveness of research,
discuss the reported movements, and probable
intentions of people whom they know only by
hearsay&mdash;call it fame if you will&mdash;and of whose
actual proceedings they have no idea but what
they glean from the misinformed collectors of
fashionable intelligence for the newspapers,
and of whose real characters or domestic pursuits 

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

they understand infinitely less than they
do of the cabinet secrets of the King of Ava,
or the proceedings of the Privy Council at
Tooramoorotatewangy.</p>

<p>If I have since felt lassitude and weariness
at the common place suppositions of these
white-waistcoated wise-acres, relieved only by a
sort of indignation at the doltish stupidity of
their fancies and calculations, I doubt very
much whether I was ever so much worried in
after life by their elaborated nonsense as I was
by Tom Hickson's conversation on the day to
which I now refer. It was now some time since
I had emerged from the cellar of Stone Buildings, 
led as it were up the Glacis, by his suggestion 
and at his invitation. It was to <i>him</i> I owed
my introduction to the actors, and to his genius
and addiction to theatrical pursuits was I indebted 
for having forsaken the study to which
he now appeared devoted. He had however
subsided into the jog-trot routine which at
his instigation I had abandoned, and in consequence 
of the start a-head which I had taken,

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

rendered more effective, perhaps, by his retrograde 
movement, I felt myself, as the people
call it "bored to death," by his platitudes&mdash;his
suppositions&mdash;his inquiries&mdash;in short&mdash;his nonsense.</p>

<p>Thus it is&mdash;what delights, enchants, and enchains 
us at one period of life, becomes by comparison 
with other things, when we return to it,
flat, stale, and unprofitable. I remember when
I was at school&mdash;days to which, as I have
already said, I never recur with any superabundant 
pleasure, I had established in my
mind that a certain Mrs. Burgoyne&mdash;<i>we</i> called
her Mother Burgoyne&mdash;had a character for
making apple tarts, which stood high in my
estimation, and in that of all my school-fellows;
she had, moreover, the reputation of being
a witch, but that, whether it were true or
not, did not, in any important degree, interfere 
with her management of the pies, and
<i>certes</i>, never did the finest <i>patesserie</i> of the
unrivalled Jenkins, of Burlington House celebrity 
in those times, delight me more than

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

the <i>Tourte &agrave; la Bourgoine</i> of my early
days.</p>

<p>Passing through the Town in which I had
received&mdash;no education&mdash;but where my exemplary 
mother had deposited sundry quarterly
payments of cash as the <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;for my
instruction (baffled by my own idleness and
stupidity), and having a friend with me, who
had accompanied me in a visit to the school-house, 
play-ground, and all the rest of it, I
desired the waiter at the inn, to be sure to have
some of Mrs. Burgoyne's tarts in the second
course of our inn dinner. The man stared&mdash;I 
concluded that my fair sorceress was defunct&mdash;no&mdash;she 
was alive and merry; but to my
surprise the man, who knew the "fascinating
creature" by name, declared that however unjustifiable 
the imputation of witchery might be,
her tarts were things not eatable. Still I
insisted, and the tarts were produced&mdash;and
any thing more detestably filthy never were
seen. I taxed the waiter, who seemed to enjoy
the joke against me excessively, with a falling

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

off in the manufacture, perhaps attributable to
the increased age of the manufacturer&mdash;but, no,&mdash;he 
assured me that the tarts were the same as
ever, and it was only I that was changed. I believe
in the sequel I was obliged to admit the justice
of his decision; and, in the course of my after
life I have had a thousand occasions to justify
it. Return to a place which you have fancied
a paradise, after some ten or fifteen years'
ramble over the world; it remains the same, but
the ideas have expanded, the eye has rested
upon flood and field, upon lake and mountain,
and upon sea and torrent: when you reach the
desired haven, after your voyage, although hearts
may beat as kindly, and eyes beam as brightly as
ever, still the <i>locale</i> invariably disappoints you.
A man born in Lincoln, or in Norwich, or in
Nottingham, comes to London, and passes some
ten or twelve years of his life&mdash;he left his birth-place 
at fifteen or sixteen&mdash;rely upon it, although
he may admire St. Paul's, and be pleased with
Guildhall, or even admit the length of the
Metropolitan Streets, the recollection of High

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

Street, or the Market-Place, or the Castle
Hill, or something peculiar to his own native
town, is permanently fixed in his imagination as
infinitely superior to them all; nor is it till he
returns to his favourite spot that he finds how
entirely first impressions have possessed him,
and how egregiously mistaken he has been in
the institution of his comparisons.</p>

<p>My friend Tom Hickson was <i>my</i> Castle Hill,
<i>my</i> Market-Place&mdash;<i>my</i> High-street&mdash;I thought
I never heard any man say such silly things&mdash;he 
seemed to me to talk "Morning Post"&mdash;all
his observations were copied nearly <i>verbatim</i>
from that fashionable paper, which at that time
was exclusively devoted to gossip, whence it was
clear to me he had learned to string a parcel of
names together, and attribute to the specified
individuals, proceedings of which they were
themselves entirely ignorant. He announced
to me the arrival in London of some man, of
whose departure from town three days before, I
was perfectly aware; hinted at a marriage in
high life as likely to take place during the

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

following week, which I knew had gone off
altogether during the last fortnight; and gave
me a confidential account of a <i>faux pas</i> between
Lord L&mdash;&mdash; and Lady M&mdash;&mdash;, in which there
was not one word of truth, the whole history
of which, as Daly had told it me, I like my
friend Hull, "happened to know," was furnished
to the newspapers by the aforesaid lord, under the
impression that the object of his pursuit would,
by the paragraph, be either frightened or induced
into committing the very peccadillo which he
announced to the public by anticipation.</p>

<p>Hickson too continued his addiction to the
theatre&mdash;talked of scarcely anything else&mdash;to
<i>be</i> sure, he had not written a farce and failed&mdash;to 
<i>me</i> the subject was odious, and I declare I
rejoiced excessively when he apologised for
leaving me so early, inasmuch as he was engaged 
to dine at some extremely convivial club
of which he was an honorary member, in order
to initiate two novices into the arcana of the
society, by blinding their eyes, daubing their
faces with mustard, and then making them

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

smoke pipes, into the bowls of which, gunpowder
had been previously introduced sufficient to blow
the said pipes to atoms; a joke which although
some preceding dunce had suffered the loss of
an eye by the explosion, was still considered
extremely good, and to which all the aspirants
for admission into the very comical community
were obliged to submit.</p>

<p>Many things, I admit, combined to excite
this distaste to my early acquaintance&mdash;I knew
him best when I knew Emma Haines first&mdash;that
was an association, and one which I wished
especially to avoid&mdash;I could not hear from Daly
for some days. I dreaded to think the time
which must necessarily elapse.&mdash;Then <i>that</i> Mrs.
Fletcher Green worried me,&mdash;what to do I did
not know,&mdash;dinner was to be eaten&mdash;or at least
the ceremony to be gone through&mdash;and the evening 
to be disposed of afterwards! After some
self-debating, I determined to go to the Opera&mdash;I 
knew Mrs. Fletcher Green had a box there&mdash;I 
would find it out, and even if I dared not
approach it&mdash;for I really, where self was concerned, 

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

was very shy&mdash;I at least could watch
her from afar, and judge by what I saw, the
general tenor of her conduct, and whether she
seemed to be as agreeable to everybody else
as she most assuredly had been to me.</p>

<p>This scheme I put into execution. In those
days ladies wore fans, upon which the plot of the
whole house was developed&mdash;each circle, each
box, with its owner's name, was printed and published; 
but in these later and more degenerate
days, so many great ladies only hire other peoples'
boxes for the night, and so many great gentlemen 
let theirs the same way, that such directions
would be of no more use than the Court Guide
is, in giving us the addresses of people who take
ready-furnished houses from people who are
ready to part with them during their convenient
absence in the country or on the Continent. From
one of these, then useful directories, I gained the
wished for intelligence, and accordingly posted
myself in the alley of the pit, where I could command 
a perfect view of the fascinating widow,
who was on this special night accompanied by a

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

fair creature, something younger than herself,
and not quite so handsome. The difference of
age is so well managed in large assemblies, that
I was not quite prepared to decide whether the
junior lady might not be daughter of the senior
one&mdash;I hardly thought it probable, even if it
were possible, and Daly, in all he had said about
Mrs. Fletcher Green, and her agreeable house,
and her agreeable parties, and her agreeable
fortune, had never once mentioned that there
was such a thing as a Miss F. G. in existence.</p>

<p>I watched her very attentively during the
evening&mdash;her vivacity seemed continuous and
unweariable. A rapid succession of young men,
middle-aged men, and old men, appeared in her
box; and I could hear the joyous tones of her
voice frequently louder than the moanings of a
wretched captive, in green crape, with tin
fetters, who was growling out her grief on the
stage; indeed, although she had professed herself 
to me the most devoted admirer of Italian
music, it did not appear to me that she took the

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

slightest notice, or paid the smallest attention
to the business of the stage. Still I saw she
was the "admired of all," and I fancied I was
the "admired of <i>her</i>"&mdash;<i>laudari &agrave; laudat&acirc;</i>. Ten
times at least I resolved to go boldly to the box,
and share her favours with her other visitors;
but ten times my heart sank within me. Whenever 
I felt a want of confidence in myself, my
thoughts reverted to Emma Haines, and I asked
myself if I should like to see <i>her</i> going on so
gaily, and noisily, and happily, and carelessly, as
Mrs. Fletcher Green was? But then the case
was different&mdash;she was a widow, and had no
husband to control her, no partner of domestic
happiness to share her pleasures and (if she
ever could have any), her sorrows. However, I
thought, perhaps, it was better matters should
remain as they were: what possible good could
I do by increasing my intimacy with this gay
woman of fortune, when, if Daly's kind and zealous 
exertions brought about the other affair, she
might not, after all, be the sort of person I should
choose as the intimate friend of Emma, and if

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

I judged Emma aright, not the sort of person
Emma would choose for herself?</p>

<p>For that night I contented myself with
watching the evanishment of my bright star
from the sphere which she adorned and illuminated. 
I felt afraid of encountering her. I
went to the fire-place in the hall, although the
"fire was fled," and half fearful of being seen,
beheld her tripping like a sylph down the little
stair-case from the pit tier, in which her box
was situated. I heard loud calls for "Mrs.
Fletcher Green's carriage"&mdash;I saw her looking 
all round and round&mdash;at length her eye
caught mine, she instantly dragged a huge
grenadier looking fellow, upon whose arm she
was leaning, across the lobby, in order to shake
hands with me, and scold me for not having
called in the morning. I made a sort of stammering 
apology, and felt wonderfully relieved
when I heard one of the stentors of the outer
lobby proclaiming that "Mrs. Fletcher Green's
carriage stopped the way." The man who was
with her was particularly odious to me&mdash;he had

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

curly black hair, and a high white forehead,
great sparkling eyes, and a row of teeth like
ivory, which he incessantly exhibited by a
sort of perpetual grin over the heads of all the
surrounding crowd. The attendant sylph was
escorted by a more reasonable person, of the
middle age of life, from whom she appeared to
divert all her attention in order to look at <i>me</i>,
while Mrs. Green was talking to me; and the
moment the carriage was announced, and they
passed on, I saw her pull my fair widow back to
inquire who I was, and then I saw the odious
grenadier laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought I, as the group vanished
among the cocked hats of the footmen, and the
torches of the link boys, "it won't do." Nevertheless, 
I resolved upon calling the next day,
before I took my departure for Hull's house, at
Mitcham.</p>

<p>The morning came, and I put my scheme
into execution, and proceeded to her residence,
which was near Park Lane, and while going,
I could not entirely divest myself of a consciousness 

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

that, admitting the feeling which the
widow's smiles and conversation had excited, I
was behaving ill&mdash;shamefully ill&mdash;to somebody;
either to Mrs. Fletcher Green, or to Miss Emma
Haines&mdash;and yet&mdash;recollect&mdash;I was young, and
ardent, and thoughtless. I knocked at the
door&mdash;the fair tenant of the mansion was out&mdash;at 
least she was not "at home." But I was
perfectly convinced, from the manner of her
porter, that I was denied the privilege of the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i>, only because my person was not known,
and my name had not yet been inscribed in her
visiting list. I left my card, and strolled into
the Park, meaning to return in time to mount
my gig and drive down to the Tusculum of
my hospitable friend.</p>

<p>When I reached my lodgings I found a dear
delicate three-cornered note, written in the most
delightfully unintelligible hand, by dear Mrs.
Fletcher Green herself, confirming my suspicion 
as to the cause of my non-admission when I
called, and begging me to come <i>sans fa&ccedil;on</i>, to
meet Lady Wolverhampton at dinner&mdash;a very

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

small party, and very agreeable people&mdash;I was
engaged, and could therefore do nothing but
send an apology. I confess I regretted it, and
I believe, for a moment, entertained a thought
of throwing over my Mitchamites, and accepting
the invitation to the widow's&mdash;but if such an idea
did flash into my mind, it was only to be rejected
with disdain&mdash;Hull's kindness and hospitality did
not merit such a slur. So I wrote my answer,
despatched it&mdash;jumped into my <i>carriage</i>, and
drove off for the country.</p>

<p>In those days men drove "gigs" as they since
have driven stanhopes, tilburys, dennets, and
cabriolets, and I rather piqued myself upon
my "turn out;" my chestnut horse was a fast
trotter, and in little more than three quarters of
an hour, from Westminster bridge, I reached
mine host's retreat, the locality of which was
specially distinguished by its facing the common, 
and looking infinitely neater and more
rural than the neighbouring houses, whose London 
loving owners had decorated their hermitages, 
villas, cots, and cottages with knockers,

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

lamps, and brass-plates, one of which specially
indicated not only that the red-brick edifice
before me was "Belle vue Lodge," but that
its respectable owner's name was "Mr. Blutch."</p>

<p>When I drove up to the gate of Hull's house,
I saw his good natured face peering over the
hedge which separated his garden from the
road, like "a rose in June," flowering on its
native stem&mdash;in a moment he was at his gate,
and in another I had set my foot in his domain,
a little bijou of neatness, niceness, prettiness,
and sweetness. I saw company in the garden
heard laughter in the bowers, and casting my
eyes through two French windows which opened
on the lawn, beheld a table covered for eight.
The roses, the mignonette, the heliotropes, all
combined their fragrance to refresh the air, and
although from its proximity to the high-way,
Hull's servant had to brush the plants as he
did his coat, every morning, to get rid of the
dust, it was what the most fastidious critic must
have pronounced a delightful little place.</p>

<p>Some of the assembled party were unknown

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

to me, although none of them were unknown
to fame; an enthusiastic poet, a witty and
agreeable barrister, the editor of a weekly
newspaper, a fashionable preacher, and an opulent 
city merchant, then one of the sheriffs of
London, added to one of the popular actors with
whom I was previously acquainted, formed a
society, which, from its miscellaneous character,
promised a great treat to one who like myself, at
that time of my life, professed to be only a listener. 
The sequel, however, was a disappointment.
Every one of the guests was celebrated for something, 
and each one was jealous of his neighbour.
Hull, who pooh poohed them about in his best
style, endeavoured to draw them out, and force
every man to say or do something to contribute
to the general amusement; but it was evidently
an effort; the poet had a sovereign contempt for
the barrister, and whenever he fired a pun,
preserved the most imperturbable gravity. The
barrister, who was moreover a critic, irritated
the actor, who hated the newspaper editor, for
the tone he had adopted in his theatrical

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

reviews. The clergyman kept aloof from any
controversy with the Thespian, and the sheriff,
who was worth a couple of hundred thousand
pounds, despised the whole party, and set them
down as a parcel of paupers who were obliged
to get their bread by the exercise of their
talents.</p>

<p>"Any mackerel, Mr. Sheriff?" said the barrister 
(who was acting croupier) to the citizen
placed at Hull's right hand.</p>

<p>"Pooh, Dubs!" exclaimed mine host, "why
do you ask such a question&mdash;eat mackerel!&mdash;I 
don't suppose Mr. Bucklesbury ever tasted a
mackerel in his life. Here's turbot, Mr. Bucklesbury&mdash;fresh 
from Billingsgate this morning&mdash;Sunday 
makes no difference with me&mdash;I happen 
to know the most eminent salesman in the
market&mdash;Bless your soul, he wouldn't mind
sending a boat express to Torbay for a turbot
for <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Very fine fish indeed," said, or rather
snorted, Bucklesbury.</p>

<p>"Fine," exclaimed Hull, "nothing at all, my

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

dear Sir, to what you have at home&mdash;eh&mdash;I
happen to know&mdash;there's no man so particular
about his fish as you."</p>

<p>"I like it good when I has it," said Bucklesbury; 
"is there any lobster sauce?"</p>

<p>"Any!" cried Hull, "my dear friend, there
are loads of lobsters&mdash;thousands&mdash;here, you
stupid dog&mdash;bring some of those sauce tureens
to the sheriff."</p>

<p>The conversation at dinner consisted of little
more than a repetition of pressings and refusings,
and of challenges to drink wine, and observations 
upon the wine itself. A very fine haunch
of venison made its appearance, which somewhat
varied the letter, but not the spirit of the discussion; 
and to hear Mr. Bucklesbury lecture
upon fat and lean, the alderman's walk, and
currant jelly (of which, Hull told us, he had
millions of pots, and which Bucklesbury was
good enough to inform us, went remarkably well
with venison), illustrated as it was with plates,
was enough to make any human being as sick
as I certainly thought he must himself have

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

been long before the close of the entertainment.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that good digestion
waited upon appetite, for after his display of
activity as regarded the first course, he performed 
upon a couple of young ducks in a manner 
which astonished one half of the company,
and disgusted the other. " 'S'bud!" said the
barrister, "a joke's a joke, but this it too much
for friendship&mdash;an Eton man&mdash;eh&mdash;civic&mdash;what,
eh&mdash;" all of which running commentary upon the
exhibition of the overgrown citizen, kept Hull,
who worshipped the Josh, in a state of fever, by
no means rendered intermittent by the imitative
powers of my friend the actor, who contrived to
swell himself like the frog in the fable, and
make himself, thin as he was, the very <i>fac simile</i>
of the mountainous <i>millionnaire</i>.</p>

<p>The dessert&mdash;after Hull's description of his
fruit&mdash;was rather a disappointment: the currants
had been gathered, the gooseberries stolen, but
there were still "<i>busshells</i>" of apples; and the
cellar afforded the juice of the grape in its best

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

possible state; "hundreds" of bottles graced the
board, and every disposition to do ample justice
to the profusion of our Amphytrion was manifested 
by his much delighted guests.</p>

<p>The conversation, so long as "reason maintained 
her seat," was not much more cordial or
vivacious, than it had been earlier in the day.
Bucklesbury, the <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> of our host, was marked
by his visitors as the general butt for their shafts,
and the wags were most assuredly united, if in
nothing else, in the determination to make him
ridiculous. To say truth, he gave them but
little trouble; but as the wine mounted, the
feelings and passions of the party began to
develop themselves; the claret acted as varnish
to the picture, and brought out all the lights
and shadows of their minds; and what struck me
particularly, who drank less, or at least less
rapidly than my companions, was, that exactly
in proportion as their animosity towards each
other became more evident, they affected an
additional degree of candour, prefacing the
bitterest and most sarcastic observations, with

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

declarations such as "Not that <i>I</i> think so, it is
only what I hear!"&mdash;"Of course I don't allude
to any particular person!"&mdash;"I hope nobody
will think!" and so on, until from "gentle
converse and communings sweet," the dinner-room 
assumed the tone and character of a miniature 
Babel, a fact of which the neighbourhood
appeared to be pretty well aware, since groups
of Mitchamites were seen looking and listening 
over the neat trimmed hedge, which, in the
earnestness of argument, every body had forgotten 
was all that separated us from the
public road. As the clergyman had left the
party some time before it had arrived at its
acm&eacute;, we had few scruples about our audience,
and Hull, who was quite a triton amongst the
minnows of Mitcham, "liked it."&mdash;"Pooh, pooh,
my dear friend, let them hear&mdash;they may go a
long way before they hear so many clever
people talking again! My dear Sir, Mr.
Bucklesbury, it is not worth my while, to
have dull people here&mdash;I value wit&mdash;I appreciate 

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

it&mdash;I have lived all my life with
wits&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;From Rochester downwards," said the
barrister.</p>

<p>"Thank my stars," said Bucklesbury, "I
know very little about wits."</p>

<p>"Yet," said Duberly, "you seem always to
have your wits about you."</p>

<p>"Dubs, Dubs," said Hull, checking the vivacity 
of the lawyer&mdash;perfectly aware that his
opulent and corpulent friend had as faint a
notion of taking as of making a joke.</p>

<p>"Yes Sir," said the citizen, "the man must
get up very early who hopes to master me.
I've raised myself to my present high station&mdash;(Duberly's 
mouth curled, and the actor made a
face)&mdash;by plain, plodding industry,&mdash;many a
little makes a mickle, and you may rely upon it
there are more fortunes saved than gained."</p>

<p>"But how the deuce," said Duberly, "is a
man to begin saving, who has nothing to begin
with?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

<p>"Industry will always furnish the means, and
economy will do the rest," said Bucklesbury.
"Sir, I walked my way up to London with
half-a-crown in my pocket, and I am now worth
a couple of hundred thousand pounds, and no
man can say black's the white of my eye.&mdash;I 
had a friend who left our native town the
same day as I did&mdash;he travelled by the waggon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Like the Thespians," said Duberly.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Dubs," said Hull, giving the barrister 
a wink, by way of caution not to irritate
the actor.</p>

<p>"And what became of <i>him?</i>" said Duberly.</p>

<p>"Him," exclaimed Hull! "pooh, pooh. Dubs,
you know him very well&mdash;so do you, Tim&mdash;I
think we all happen to know him&mdash;an excellent
man too&mdash;and an alderman&mdash;eh&mdash;Mr. Sheriff&mdash;eh&mdash;I'm 
right&mdash;eh, you dog?"</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Duberly, "our friend Firkins?"</p>

<p>"<i>To</i> be sure," said Hull.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

<p>"Yes, but he's pretty well to do, as a body
may say," said the barrister.</p>

<p>"Say!" exclaimed Hull&mdash;"what do you mean
by 'a body may say?'&mdash;he is a beggar&mdash;that's
the consequence of his extravagance."</p>

<p>"A beggar!" said Duberly, "why, he is an
alderman."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it?" said Hull.</p>

<p>"I can't exactly say as he is a beggar," said
the sheriff, "he has made his hundred thousand
snug, I'll be sworn."</p>

<p>"Well, but my dear friend," said Hull,
"that's being a beggar compared with <i>you</i>. My
dear Sir, I don't mean to say he begs about the
streets&mdash;I mean to say he has not much more
than a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Riches, like everything else," said the poet,
who was somewhat tired of the subject, and
rather anxious to talk, "are comparative&mdash;I
confess that the value of wealth appears to me
to be exactly proportioned to the extent of
benefits it enables one to confer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

<p>"Whose benefit is fixed?" said the actor,
who hated sentimentality&mdash;stretching his head
and his hand forward, after the fashion of
Sylvester Daggerwood.</p>

<p>"I don't mean theatrical benefits, Sir," said
the poet, "I mean those solid benefits which
exalted benevolence confers on suffering genius&mdash;there 
<i>are</i> M&aelig;cenases even in these days."</p>

<p>"That there is," said the sheriff, "asses of all
sorts, I can be sworn, but none much greater
than what are called geniuses."</p>

<p>"Or Jenny asses," interrupted Duberly.</p>

<p>"Dubs, Dubs," said Hull, "pray don't interrupt 
the sheriff."</p>

<p>"I never knew but one genius in my life,"
said Bucklesbury; "and a queer genius he
was; he belonged to the town I came from; he
used to write verses, and play the fiddle, and
sing the drollest songs I ever heard: he <i>was</i> a
genius and a poet&mdash;and he was hanged for
sheep-stealing afterwards."</p>

<p>"Clever fellow that," said Hull, "I happened 
to know him&mdash;Jem Fulcher&mdash;pooh! pooh!&mdash;I've 

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

got some of his poetry now in my library&mdash;extraordinary 
character&mdash;Tim knew him&mdash;eh, 
did not you, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Knew him! to be sure I did!" said the
actor&mdash;"I gave an imitation of him after his
death&mdash;very effective&mdash;capital hit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You came in second," said Duberly&mdash;"the 
hangman had taken him off first."</p>

<p>"I have often," said the newspaper editor&mdash;who 
had hitherto said nothing&mdash;"considered
rendering the crime of sheep-stealing a capital
offence, somewhat a stretch of severity."</p>

<p>"Good!" interrupted Duberly&mdash;"a very
serious stretch too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not jesting, Sir," said the editor&mdash;"a 
person in my station, appointed&mdash;I perhaps 
ought to say, self-appointed&mdash;censor of
public morals, and arbiter of public opinion,
feels himself bound to consider maturely and
gravely every subject by which the great mass
of the people are likely to be more or less
affected."</p>

<p>" 'S'bud," said the barrister, "but the great

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

mass of the people are not likely to turn
sheep-stealers; so perhaps you might spare
yourself the pain of undertaking so grave a
task upon this particular subject."</p>

<p>"I have had a respect for sheep-stealers,
dead or alive," said the poet&mdash;the sheriff
here drew his chair at least three feet from
the inspired bard, who was evidently beginning 
an oration&mdash;"ever since the days of
Jason; the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bucklesbury, "I cannot agree
with you there, Sir."</p>

<p>"I speak of the Argonauts," continued the
poet.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir," said Bucklesbury, "I don't mean
to say a word against the family of the Arbuthnots. 
But I lived in the country as a
boy, and I cannot justify to myself sheep-stealing 
in any shape whatsoever."</p>

<p>The expression of despair which the countenance 
of the poet exhibited was admirably
imitated by his opposite neighbour of the "sock
and buskin;" and Duberly, who could no longer

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

maintain his equivocal gravity, burst into an
immoderate fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"Sir," continued the poet, who was very
drunk, and getting rather angry, "trace the
career of Jason from the moment he left the
dragon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir," interrupted the sheriff, "if your
friend goes to the Dragon, I don't say anything 
about it&mdash;I always use the Swan."</p>

<p>"Pray, Sir," said the actor, with a look of
imperturbable gravity, "how do you use a
swan?"</p>

<p>"Like a goose," said Duberly, "I suppose."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hull," said the sheriff, who did not
understand the turn of the conversation, and
did not know whether to be angry or pleased,
"have you got any coffee for us?"</p>

<p>"Coffee!" said Hull, blushing blue with
exultation up to the roots of his hair&mdash;"my
dear friend, I have three thousand weight of
coffee in the house&mdash;to be sure there is coffee&mdash;and, 
eh&mdash;something after&mdash;<i>chasse!</i>&mdash;I happen
to know&mdash;splendid dogs you in the city&mdash;but I

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

think I have some Maraschino that never was
equalled."</p>

<p>"Have him out," said the barrister.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! my dear Dubs," said Hull,
"you have had him out, as you call it, often
enough&mdash;you and Tim there have drank enough
of it to know its quality."</p>

<p>"How, Sir," said the newspaper editor, "is
the importation of those liqueurs managed?&mdash;isn't 
there something like a case to be made
out against the government for permitting the
introduction of foreign spirits?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Duberly, "a liqueur-case."</p>

<p>"I am not joking, Mr. Duberly," said the
editor, with a gravity more than proportioned
to the occasion, "I speak, Sir, for information&mdash;I 
act not for myself but the world at large;&mdash;men 
who devote themselves to the service
of their country, as I do, do so because they
hope it will be profitable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;To themselves," interrupted Duberly.</p>

<p>"Dubs, Dubs," said Hull, raising his glass
to his eye, and frowning as severely as the

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

kind, good-natured expression of his countenance 
would permit him, "you let nobody
speak but yourself."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Dubs, sipping
his wine with a provoking coolness, which
seemed to indicate a determination to go on
for some time, "everybody speaks except myself&mdash;I 
only observe."</p>

<p>"I remain firm," said the editor, "to my
question."</p>

<p>"I can't answer it," said the sheriff&mdash;"for
I am not in that line&mdash;I know nothing of the
spirit business&mdash;but I'll be hanged, as far as
taste goes, if I don't think good cherry-bounce
flogs all the foreign trash in the world."</p>

<p>"You are joking, Mr. Bucklesbury," said
Hull&mdash;who, whenever anybody candidly spoke
in approbation of something of a secondary
nature, according to price, fancied he was
quizzing him&mdash;for Hull, with all his good nature, 
was tenderly susceptible of being made
ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Not I," said the sheriff; "I have often

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

said to Mrs. B. when we have been dining
out&mdash;and when in course one always eats and
drinks a considerable sight more than one does
at home&mdash;that I, for one, prefer rum shrub or
cherry brandy to all the garuses, and mallyskinos,
and curasores in the world. However, here, I
suppose, you are too fine to have such a thing
as cherry bounce?"</p>

<p>"Bounce!" exclaimed Hull, "cherry bounce,
my dear friend!&mdash;there's Dubs can tell you&mdash;I 
have gallons of it&mdash;make it by hogsheads&mdash;I 
have seven hundred pints of it in the next
room."</p>

<p>Upon saying which, he rang the bell, and
ordered the servant&mdash;first giving him a key
and a caution&mdash;to bring forth sundry bottles of
the boasted beverage&mdash;for let it always be
remembered, that Hull's cases of what might
be thought bounce&mdash;were all as genuine as this
of the cherry bounce&mdash;he <i>had</i> all the things
he talked of, but his magnificence in the
way of provision was what one certainly was

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

not prepared for; and therefore until a certain
number of cherry brandy bottles had been
produced by way of ratification, it seemed
almost impossible to believe the extent of his
preparations for conviviality.</p>

<p>Just as we were going to coffee, Hull gave
a sort of supplicatory, hinting look to the actor,
indicating a desire that he would sing a song&mdash;which, 
since it grew very near to Monday,
and the clergyman had long before departed,
seemed not very sinful. Of course, he had
a headache and a cold, and "never did," and
so on;&mdash;however, at last he complied, and gave
us one of the most entertaining descriptions of
a fair, or a fight, or a race&mdash;I now forget which&mdash;I 
ever heard in my life, interspersed with
sundry imitations of men, women, and children,
not to speak of animals, ornithological and
mammalial, the effect of which was wound up
to a screaming power of laughter, by his introducing 
the most perfect imitation of the
sheriff himself, who about two minutes after

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

the exhibition began to be beyond measure
comical, had dropped his dewlap on his frill,
and fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>Duberly was very much inclined to blacken
the sheriff's face with burnt cork, after the
fashion of my friend Daly at Richmond. But
Hull, who was the very pink, I might say the
crimson, of propriety, would not hear of such
a thing; and accordingly we waited until the
actor, less scrupulous than Dubs, prepared <i>secundum 
artem</i>, a pellet of bread, which well and
properly directed against the left eye of Mr.
Bucklesbury, caused him to awake from his
slumbers, which he did, grunting out, as he
raised his head from his waistcoat, clapping his
hand on the table, "Bravo! very good!&mdash;thank
you&mdash;very good indeed!"</p>

<p>Up-stairs we went&mdash;the sheriff, of course,
taking precedence&mdash;and there we had our coffee,
our chasse, and a little tranquillity; and during
this pause, the sheriff, next whom I was placed,
began to talk to me. He had heard that I was
neither poet, dramatist, editor, painter, nor

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

player&mdash;in short, that I had no intellectual
qualities by which I could possibly earn a
shilling; but that, on the contrary, I had an
income derivable from property which became
hereditarily mine, he therefore felt a becoming 
respect for me; besides, I had never attempted 
a joke, indeed scarcely had spoken, and
I therefore imagine I came up to what, in his
fat mind, was a "quiet, gentlemanly man:" he
patronized, he fostered me, and I was grateful;
and after having looked at me with his fishy
eyes for a minute or two, he asked me, with a
gravity which I confess was more than adequate
to the occasion, "whether I had ever eaten
marrow pudding."</p>

<p>I was somewhat astounded, but I was quite
sure it meant something kind, and would lead to
something else, so I answered, as indeed I could
not fail to do, if truth were to be my guide,
that I had not, nor could I imagine how such a
composition could be prepared.</p>

<p>"Dine with me to-morrow at the Old Bailey," 
said the sheriff.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

<p>I said I was very much obliged, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But me no buts," said the sheriff, "except
a butt of sherry&mdash;I say, that's a joke, isn't it&mdash;don't 
say nothing to them as is here&mdash;but you
come to the Sessions' House to-morrow about
four&mdash;it's the last day&mdash;we shall dine at six&mdash;Common 
Sergeant dines at three&mdash;Recorder
goes down to try, and I shall be glad of your
company. Sentences and all that&mdash;fine sight&mdash;shows 
what I call human nature&mdash;eh&mdash;come&mdash;ask 
for Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury,&mdash;the divil himself 
can't prevent you coming in&mdash;you understand&mdash;mum&mdash;not 
a word&mdash;I don't half like these
chaps&mdash;that editor, and the poet, I don't understand 
'em&mdash;and the actor is a deuced sight too
funny for me&mdash;but&mdash;you'll excuse me&mdash;I like
<i>you</i>, and I say so&mdash;I never makes two words
of a straw,&mdash;you come&mdash;hear the sentences, and
eat marrow pudding&mdash;and don't say a word
to nobody about it."</p>

<p>The combination was curious, "to hear
sentences and eat marrow pudding;" to me it
was indeed a treat; I had an anxious time to

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

pass until I could hear from Daly, and was
justified, as I felt, in diverting my thoughts from
the one object, thinking of which could do me
no good. I felt flattered too that this great
civic authority should have selected me for his
particular notice and civility, and besides, I had
never seen a criminal court; my experience
had been limited to occasional visits on the
bench at Bow-street to my worthy friend,
whose advice I had slighted, and whose tutelage
I had spurned; and altogether it was new, it
was something to excite, and to those who
recollect what a man of twenty-one is when
he is in love, it must be quite clear that excitement, 
<i>oustre</i> the one subject, is indeed
rarely to be produced: I therefore agreed to
accept the invitation of Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury, 
who squeezed my hand, in confirmation of
the engagement, in a manner which I have
never forgotten. If it were possible to imagine
a pair of walnut-crackers made to the same size
as that of his Worship's thumb and fingers, I
am quite sure their pressure would be a trifle

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

compared to the grip which I received from
my new and extensive friend&mdash;I was certain
it was done in kindness, but at least a week
elapsed before I recovered from the effects of
it.</p>

<p>Our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> was interrupted by the facetious 
Duberly, who believing that the sheriff
was a saint, asked him whether he had any
objection to a rubber; before his answer was
given, Hull, who watched his worship with an
almost Koo-too-ing kindness, came up, and
drawing off the barrister, said to him, "Dubs,
Dubs, don't be childish&mdash;no cards here on a
Sunday."</p>

<p>"No," said Duberly, "I am sure we shall
have none&mdash;for you have none in the house."</p>

<p>"None!" exclaimed Hull, as usual&mdash;"no
cards&mdash;come, come, Tim, you know better
than that&mdash;I have got two hundred and fifty
packs in this very room!"</p>

<p>A sort of doubtful murmur ran through the
party, and the poet said something of "speaking
by the card," when Hull, getting rather angry at

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

being doubted, proceeded to unlock a closet in
the room, and the moment the door was opened
at least twenty packs of entirely new cards tumbled 
out upon the floor; the astonishment was
general.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said Hull, "you ought
to know me better&mdash;I never say what isn't true&mdash;I 
bought these cards two years ago&mdash;best
cards you ever played with&mdash;I never buy inferior 
articles&mdash;got them in a lump&mdash;two hundred 
and fifty packs&mdash;told you so&mdash;you may
count 'em, Dubs&mdash;I see you laughing, Tim&mdash;you 
may laugh&mdash;count 'em as you would benefit 
tickets&mdash;eh&mdash;Tim&mdash;pooh, pooh&mdash;don't tell
me."</p>

<p>Whether we did or did not play cards, I
really do not now recollect&mdash;I remember laughing 
until I almost cried at some delightful imitations 
of the actor. We had anchovy toasts and
broiled bones, and all the incentives to dissipation, 
in which we speedily engaged; punch, and
all other destructive and delightful drinks, were
introduced; the actor became more and more

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

agreeable, for he was not only the most agreeable 
of actors, but the most intellectual of all
comedians I ever met with; the editor seemed
pacified; Dubs was delightful; and the poet concluded 
the sports of the evening by pulling off
his wig, and throwing it at the inimitable favorite
of the Theatre. Then all became noise, confusion, 
mirth and mystification; and when I
opened my eyes in the morning, I found myself
as thirsty as a crocodile, with a tremendous
headache, and pains in all my joints, the sure
result of excess committed in my early life.</p>

<p>When I woke I could not for some time
recollect where I was, or where I had dined.
I could by no means remember how I got to
the bed in which I found myself&mdash;it was the
scene of St. James's Street acted over again,
only there had been no gambling, and there
were no visible results. I began to consider
whether I had said or done anything either
particularly ridiculous or offensive; but vain
were my efforts at reflection, until the chambermaid 
coming into the room, at once, by

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

an association not to be questioned, convinced
me that when I came to the inn from Hull's,
the night before, I had</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Fancied she was a goddess,
Who thought me a fool;"</p>

</div>

<p>and oh, how abashed, and dissatisfied does a
fellow feel, when he awakes, in his sober senses,
to a faint recollection of the absurdities he
has committed while degraded and debased by
wine, or what the very genteel may think
even worse, punch,&mdash;and I too&mdash;the devoted
to Emma.&mdash;I never shall forget the feverish,
heated, mawkish, wretched state in which I
was; however it seemed an understood thing
that I was to appear at breakfast, and (for I
recollected my engagement) subsequently dine
at the Old Bailey to eat marrow pudding, by
invitation from one of the sheriffs of London
and Middlesex.</p>

<p>There is no meal so odious as breakfast, in
company. I had been excellent friends with all
the mad devils of the preceding night, but
when I came, sick and uncomfortable, into the

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

breakfast room, I had to begin it all again, to
re-commence my acquaintance, and to hear, by
way of comfort, innumerable allusions to what
I had said and done, in the latter part of the
preceding evening, of which I was myself perfectly 
unconscious; and then the wretched
effort at eating, the tasteless tea, the dreadful 
egg&mdash;the pithy fowl&mdash;the briny ham&mdash;I was
near dying of it, and sorely repented that I had
so far invaded Hull's most unquestionable hospitality 
as to remain for the night at Mitcham.</p>

<p>Hull, however, was off to business early&mdash;his 
gig and horse were at the door by ten, and
he and Duberly dashed away, the one to the
city, the other to the Temple; the poet lodged
near at hand, and the editor walked off to
town, intending as he said to loiter about the
neighbourhood of Lower Tooting, for the purpose 
of collecting some information upon the
actual state of the population of the agricultural 
districts; the actor was not up, and did
not come down to breakfast&mdash;he saw no fun
in early hours, and therefore him I did not

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

meet, but else by eleven o'clock we were all
on the wing, and I left the cottage impressed
with the kindness and hospitality of my new
old friend Hull, who had completely vindicated
himself from what I really did, before I had
witnessed the proofs of his veracity, think was
a little in the line of our venerable friend the
Baron Munchausen. Having taken my departure, 
I drove to town, in order, if possible, by
some means to refresh and re-invigorate myself
sufficiently to appear before the Judge and
Jury, at the hour mentioned by my worshipful
friend, Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury.</p>

<p>It may seem singular&mdash;even extraordinary&mdash;having 
in my earlier days, as I have already
said, frequently visited my worthy friend the
magistrate at Bow Street; and later in my
career attended the Courts in Westminster
Hall, that I had never been in a court
of criminal justice; and as I have also said&mdash;perhaps 
superfluously&mdash;there is something
extremely embarrassing in the anticipation of
entering upon an entirely new scene of action

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

in society. My directions from my new and
important friend the sheriff, were, however,
plain and explicit; and accordingly, at a little
before three, I presented myself at a door
under the colonnade at the back of the Sessions
House, and was speedily ushered on to the
bench, where I had no sooner taken my seat,
than with a feeling hardly explicable, but which
I positively declare originated in diffidence, I
fancied myself the object of general attention;
the fact being that no human creature in the
Court (which was crowded to excess) was conscious 
whether I had come into it or not.</p>

<p>My friend Bucklesbury, who was seated in
full costume at the left hand of the semicircular
tribune, in a box of his own, his wand of office
erect at his side, and a bouquet upon the desk
before him, beckoned me in a kind and condescending 
manner to approximate; and I accordingly 
shifted my position so as to come
more immediately under his wing, or rather
nearly over his head, in which position I much
rejoiced, as he was kind enough to enlighten me

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

upon many points with respect to proceedings
in criminal law with which I was before by no
means familiar.</p>

<p>As I entered the Court, a case of some
importance had just terminated, and the judge
just concluded his summing up, when the
clerk of the arraigns, put the customary question 
to the jury, "How say ye, gentlemen&mdash;is 
the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?"
Upon which the jurymen laid their heads
together, and I heard something in a whisper
from their foreman, who immediately pronounced 
the agreeable verdict, "not guilty."
The prisoner bowed gracefully&mdash;he was a pick-pocket&mdash;and 
retired.</p>

<p>The prompt decision of the jury convinced
me that it must have been a clear case; and
I rejoiced at the departure of the now exonerated 
sufferer.</p>

<p>"That's a reg'lar rascal," said the sheriff
to me in a whisper; "never was such a case
heard on, to be sure&mdash;seventeen watches, thirty-two 
pocket handkerchiefs, four pair of spectacles, 

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

and five snuff-boxes, all found upon his
person!"</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, "the evidence could not have
been very strong against him&mdash;the jury acquitted
him after a minute's consultation."</p>

<p>"Evidence, Mr. Gurney!" said the sheriff,
"how little do you know of the Old Bailey!&mdash;why 
if these London juries were to wait to consider 
evidence, we never should get through the
business&mdash;the way we do here, is to make a zig-zag 
of it."</p>

<p>I did not exactly comprehend the term as it
was now applied, although Daly had often used
it in my society with reference to a pin and a
card universally employed at the interesting
game of <i>rouge et noir;</i> and I therefore made
no scruple of expressing my ignorance.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand, Sir?" said the sheriff&mdash;"why 
the next prisoner will be found guilty&mdash;the 
last was acquitted&mdash;the one after the next
will be acquitted too&mdash;it comes alternate like&mdash;save 
half&mdash;convict half&mdash;that's what we call a
zig-zag; and taking the haggregate, it comes

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

to the same pint, and I think justice is done as
fair here as in any court in Christendom."</p>

<p>This explanation rendered the next prisoner
who made his appearance, an object of considerable 
interest to me. He was a little dirty boy,
who stood charged with having stolen a pound
of bacon and a peg-top from a boy somewhat
his junior. The young prosecutor produced a
witness, who, as far as appearances went, might
without any great injustice have taken the place
of the prisoner, and who gave his evidence with
considerable fluency and flippancy. His manner
attracted the notice of one of the leading barristers 
of the Court, Mr. Flappertrap, who in cross
examining him, inquired whether he knew the
nature of an oath.</p>

<p>"Yes, I does," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Explain it," said Flappertrap.</p>

<p>"You may be d&mdash;&mdash;d," replied the lad, "that's
a hoath, arn't it?"</p>

<p>"What does he say?" said the Judge&mdash;who,
as I about this period discovered, was as deaf
as a post.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

<p>"He says, 'you may be d&mdash;&mdash;d,' my Lord,"
said Flappertrap, who appeared particularly glad
of an opportunity to borrow a phrase, which he
might use for the occasion.</p>

<p>"What does he mean by that?" said the
Judge.</p>

<p>"That is the way, my Lord, in which he
exhibits his knowledge of the nature of an
oath."</p>

<p>"Pah! pah!" said the Judge&mdash;"Boy, d'ye
hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy, "I hears."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to school?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy, "in St. Giles's parish
for three years."</p>

<p>"Do you know your catechism?"</p>

<p>The boy muttered something which was not
audible to the Court generally, and was utterly
lost upon the Judge personally.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" said his Lordship.</p>

<p>"Speak up, Sir," said Mr. Flappertrap.</p>

<p>The boy muttered again, looking down and
seeming embarrassed.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

<p>"Speak louder, Sir," said another barrister,
whose name I did not know, but who was remarkable 
for a most unequivocal obliquity of
vision&mdash;"speak to his Lordship&mdash;look at him&mdash;look 
as <i>I</i> do, Sir."</p>

<p>"I can't," said the boy, "you squints!"</p>

<p>A laugh followed this bit of <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, which
greatly abashed the counsellor, and somewhat
puzzled the Judge.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" said his Lordship.</p>

<p>"He says he knows his catechism, my Lord."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;does not know his catechism&mdash;why
then what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Does</i> know, my Lord," whispered the
Lord Mayor, who was in the chair.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>does</i> know&mdash;I know&mdash;here, boy,"
said his Lordship, "you know your catechism,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he sullenly.</p>

<p>"We'll see, then&mdash;what is your name?" said
his lordship.</p>

<p>"My name," said the intelligent lad&mdash;"what,
in the catechism?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

<p>"Yes, what is your name?"</p>

<p>"M. or N. as the case may be," said the
boy.</p>

<p>"Go down, go down," said the Judge, angrily,
and down he went.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," said his lordship,
"this case will require very little of your attention&mdash;the 
only evidence against the prisoner
at the bar which goes to fasten the crime upon
him, is that which has been offered by the last
witness, who evidently is ignorant of the nature
and obligation of an oath. With respect to the
pig's toes which the prisoner stands charged
with stealing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A peg-top, my Lord!" said Flappertrap,
standing up, turning round, and speaking over
the bench into the Judge's ears.</p>

<p>"Peg-top," said his Lordship&mdash;"oh&mdash;ah&mdash;I
see&mdash;very bad pen&mdash;it looks in my notes like
pig's toes. Well&mdash;peg-top&mdash;of the peg-top
which it is alleged he took from the prosecutor,
there has not been one syllable mentioned
by the prosecutor himself; nor do I see that

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

the charge of taking the bacon is by any means
proved. There is no point for me to direct
your attention to, and you will say whether
the prisoner at the bar is guilty or not; and
a very trumpery case it is altogether, that I
must admit."</p>

<p>His Lordship ceased, and the Jury again
laid their heads together; again the foreman
gave the little "hem" of conscious readiness
for decision; again did the clerk of the arraigns
ask the important question, "How say ye,
gentlemen, is the prisoner at the bar guilty or
not guilty?" "Guilty," said the foreman to the
clerk of the arraigns; and "I told you so,"
said the sheriff to me.</p>

<p>The next case was a short one. The prisoner 
a woman, the evidence clear and straight-forward; 
but no great interest was excited,
because it was known that the case, for the
trial of which in point of fact the learned
Judge had, for particular reasons, given his attendance, 
and which accounted for his Lordship's
presence at the close of the session, was very

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

speedily to come on. This extraordinary combination 
of circumstances afforded me the most
favourable opportunity of seeing all the sights
of this half awful, half amusing scene, even to
the discharge of the grand Jury, who had been
specially kept together for the purpose of finding 
or ignoring the bill preferred against the
eminent culprit, who was evidently the great
attraction of the day&mdash;having found which,
they had but three more to decide upon.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the defence of the
female prisoner, now "<i>coram nobis</i>" and just
as she was making a beautiful but useless
appeal to the "gentlemen of the jury," that
a bustle in the Court announced some coming
event.</p>

<p>"I am," said the weeping prisoner, "an
orphan&mdash;I lost my mother while I was yet a
child&mdash;my father married again, and I was
driven from what had been before a happy
home&mdash;I have only to pray&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang went a door&mdash;the scuffle of feet were
heard&mdash;down went some benches&mdash;"Make way&mdash;make 

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

way!" cried some of the officers.
"Stand back, Sir, stand back&mdash;the gentlemen
of the Grand Jury are coming into Court."
To what the moaning prisoner at the bar
might have limited her supplications, I never
had an opportunity of ascertaining, for the
noise I have mentioned was succeeded by
the appearance of eighteen or nineteen men,
dressed up in something like the shabbiest
dominos I had seen at Lady Wolverhampton's
masquerade, trimmed with very dirty fur&mdash;the
leader, or foreman, carrying in his hand three bits
of parchment. As these gentlemen advanced to
a space reserved for them in the centre of the
Court, the Judge kept exchanging bows with
them until they had all reached their destination&mdash;the 
foreman then delivered to the Clerk of
Arraigns the three bits of parchment, who, putting 
his glasses on his nose, read&mdash;James Hickson, 
larceny&mdash;not found&mdash;John Hogg, felony&mdash;true 
bill.&mdash;Mary Anne Hodges, felony&mdash;not
found. The clerk then informed his Lordship,
partly by words, and partly by signs, the result of

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

the deliberations of the Grand Jury, and the fact
that there were no more bills to send before
them. Having thus far proceeded, that officer inquired 
if the gentlemen of the Grand Jury had
any presentment to make; whereupon, the foreman, 
one of the largest, and dirtiest-looking
persons imaginable, but whose countenance was
indicative of love of power and command, and
who appeared, at the moment he prepared
himself to unburden his great soul of a grievance, 
to feel as if the whole world were a foot-ball, 
made for him to play with.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said he, drawing himself up into
an attitude, "I am sure I need not, at this time
of day, enter into any discussion with your
Lordship on the vast importance of the rights
and privileges of Englishmen&mdash;of the original
establishment of the trial by Jury in this country.
It would be worse than idle to occupy your
valuable time and that of this Court, by dilating 
upon the merits of our constitution&mdash;the
chiefest of which has, I may say&mdash;been always&mdash;and 
I will say&mdash;wisely, considerately and

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

prudently held to be that peculiar mode of
administering justice between man and man.
But, my Lord, if in civil cases the deliberation
and decision of a Jury are considered adequate
safeguards to the rights and property of the
people, the law, still more careful of their lives
and liberties, has interposed in criminal cases
another and a higher tribunal, in the nature of
a Grand Jury."</p>

<p>Hereabouts the Judge having bowed his
head more graciously, omitted to raise it again,
having dropped into a sound slumber.</p>

<p>"That tribunal of mediation in the first instance, 
is full of importance; and whatever subsequent 
proceedings may be taken in a case, I
do say, for myself, and my fellows, that the
decision upon <i>ex-parte</i> evidence requires more
circumspection, more care, and more consideration 
than a verdict delivered after a case has
been argued, and after witnesses have been
heard on both sides.</p>

<p>"If, my Lord, your Lordship concedes this
point, I will merely say, generally, that when

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

the mind is occupied by any important object,
more especially in matters of jurisprudence, it is
absolutely necessary that nothing, if possible,
should occur to irritate or exacerbate the feelings&mdash;all 
should be calm, and at rest."</p>

<p>Several people turned their eyes towards his
Lordship, and some smiled.</p>

<p>"No incidental annoyance should be permitted 
to interpose itself; nothing which could
divert the Judge from the point to which his intellectual 
faculties ought to be directed, and which,
my Lord, under suitable circumstances, they
would, as they should, naturally converge. But,
my Lord, we are finite beings&mdash;creatures of habit&mdash;subject 
to all the weaknesses of our nature, and
liable to be acted upon by impulses almost unaccountable 
to ourselves. For myself, and my
fellows, I may, perhaps, hope for a favourable
interpretation of our intentions, and a lenient
judgment of our conduct. We have, my Lord,
struggled hard to do our duty, and I hope we
have done it serviceably and effectually&mdash;conscientiously 
and faithfully, I am sure we have.

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

But, my Lord, we do think it necessary to call
your Lordship's most serious attention to a fact
which is embodied in the presentment I hold in
my hand. It is one which occurs to us to be of
paramount importance, as far as the tempering
of justice with mercy is involved: we have suffered 
grievously from the existence of the evil
to which we point; and although at this time of
the year its effects are of course not so heavily
felt as in the winter season, we have considered
it a duty we owe to this Court, to our fellow
countrymen, and we may say, to every man intimately 
or remotely connected with the administration 
of criminal justice, spread as they may be
over the whole surface of the globe, to state that
the chimney in the Grand Jury room smokes so
much and so continually, that it is impossible to
endure its effects calmly or patiently; and we
therefore think it right to bring the matter thus
formally before your Lordship, and to desire
that measures may be taken to abate a nuisance
which, by its effects, is calculated to thwart,
impede, and even distort the course of justice.

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

and produce evils, the magnitude of which it is
scarcely possible to imagine, and certainly not
to express."</p>

<p>A buzz of approbation from the gentlemen of
the Grand Jury, who had been undergoing the
process of smoke-drying for several days, created
a stir in the Court, in the midst of which the
learned Judge awoke; and the Lord Mayor
having whispered into his Lordship's wig, his
Lordship bowed, and the clerk took the parchment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foreman and gentlemen of the Grand
Jury," said his Lordship, "I am happy to say
that your labours for the present are concluded,
there are no more bills for your consideration;
your presentment shall be attended to, and I
have to acknowledge your great zeal and attention, 
and to give you thanks for your services&mdash;Gentlemen, 
you are now discharged."</p>

<p>The bows, and scufflings, and cries of "Make
way there for the gentlemen of the Grand
Jury, who are coming out of court" were
resumed, and the orator and his peers retired, 

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

leaving the poor girl at the bar, wondering 
what had happened, and what could
be the reason that the worshipful community 
with the cat-skin tippets should have interposed 
themselves in the middle of her pathetic
defence, in order to discuss the irritating characteristics 
of a smoky chimney.</p>

<p>I admit that the pompous oratory of the foreman, 
the "<i>mons parturiens</i>"&mdash;a splendid exhibition, 
and the "<i>ridiculus mus</i>," which eventually
presented itself, were to me treats of no common
order, and I regretted that Daly was not with
me to participate with me in devouring the
grave absurdities which we should have had
before us.</p>

<p>The trial of the girl was concluded, and I
had no doubt as to her fate, now that I became
acquainted with the principle&mdash;she was acquitted, 
and never shall I forget the effect
which this result of her trial produced upon her
manners and features. The moment my friend
Zig-zag had pronounced the words, "not guilty,"
the pathetic expression which had characterized 

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

her countenance turned into the most
humorous, and having winked her eye at the
learned Judge, who, poor man, had summed up
decidedly against her, she proceeded to place
her two hands extended in a right line from the
tip of her nose, in the direction of his lordship's
seat, after the fashion of what is called "taking
a double sight," and then, making a noise which,
if not indescribable by imitation, is certainly
irreducible to writing, something between that
which a hackney-coachman utters to encourage
his tired horses, and that which a duck makes
when it sees either a ditch or a drake in dry
weather, she turned herself suddenly round
with the least graceful piro&uuml;ette I ever saw,
leaving one of the hands which she had previously 
elevated for observation the last part of
her person visible.</p>

<p>A short case of pot-stealing followed&mdash;the
prisoner was found guilty in ten minutes; and
then came <i>the</i> case: it was a curious and
intricate one, and I felt quite assured, when I
saw the prisoner, a genteel looking young man,

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

take his place under the inverted mirror, contrived 
with an almost diabolical ingenuity, so
as to refract and reflect the light upon his face
from the huge window at his back; I said to
myself, having got both hardened and hungry
during my short probation in Court, "We shall
not dine at six to-day."</p>

<p>It might, perhaps, injure the feelings of the
individual himself, or, if he be dead, those of
his friends and relations to detail the particular
case, the more especially as nothing could be
clearer than that the crime laid to his charge
was amply and satisfactorily&mdash;to everybody except 
himself&mdash;proved and substantiated.</p>

<p>Just as the last witness for the defence was
under cross-examination, I saw one of the Lord
Mayor's servants put his powdered head in at a
little hole, and whisper something to the Ordinary 
of Newgate, a remarkably pious-looking
man, in full canonicals, with a bag wig, which, to
use Foote's phraseology, speaking of Dr. Simony,
(by whom, as of course everybody knows, he
meant the unfortunate Dr. Dodd), "looked as

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

white as a curd, and as close as a cauliflower."
It struck me that either the pretty wanton who
had just been acquitted, desired some serious
conversation with the clergyman, or that the last
convicted pot-stealer felt some qualms of conscience, 
and had sent for spiritual assistance&mdash;but 
no&mdash;my friend Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury
relieved my mind from any such apprehensions,
by inviting me to a whisper, with an expression
of countenance which convinced me that it was
nothing of so serious a character, which had
suddenly summoned the reverend divine from
the Court.</p>

<p>"Good news!" said the Sheriff; "land is in
sight."</p>

<p>"What?" said I, not exactly "catching the
idea."</p>

<p>"Dinner is not far distant," said the Sheriff,
"the Ordinary has been sent for to dress the
salad."</p>

<p>Well, thought I, that ever a man so dressed,
and so addressed, as the reverend Divine opposite, 
should quit the seat of justice tempered

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

with mercy, to mix oil and vinegar in a salad
bowl does seem strange. It was evident to <i>me</i>,
from the manner in which my friend spoke
of the chaplain's secular vocations, that his
respect for the table was infinitely greater than
that which he entertained for the cloth, and
never from that day have I seen painted over
suburban inns, "an Ordinary on Sundays at
two o'clock," without thinking of the reverend
functionary so styled in the Old Bailey, and
the probable duties he would be called upon
to perform.</p>

<p>The evidence having terminated, and the
clock pointing to fifteen minutes after six, his
lordship began summing up. I have already
mentioned that his lordship was deaf, and
the strange blunders which I noticed in his
early charges will perhaps serve to inform the
reader of these papers, whoever he may be,
that his Lordship's hand-writing was utterly unintelligible, 
even to himself; indeed so completely 
illegible were his notes, that the only
resource his Lordship had, if ever they were

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

called for upon motions for new trials&mdash;which
perhaps I need not here add, was in his Lordship's 
case by no means an unfrequent occurrence&mdash;was 
to send them to be printed&mdash;printers
being proverbially the best decypherers in the
world.</p>

<p>His Lordship's charge&mdash;barring the inevitable 
blunders and hesitations, rendered absolutely 
necessary by this almost hopeless illegibility&mdash;was 
exceedingly minute and elaborated.
He recapitulated the evidence of the three first
witnesses verbatim, and continued thus of the
fourth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen of the jury, here is Amos
Hardy&mdash;Handy&mdash;no, not Handy&mdash;Harding&mdash;Amos 
Harding tells you, that on Tuesday&mdash;no,
not Tuesday&mdash;I see&mdash;Friday, the 14th&mdash;that
is, the 24th&mdash;he was going along Liverpool&mdash;no&mdash;Liquorpond 
Street&mdash;near Guy's Island&mdash;Guy's&mdash;no&mdash;Gray's 
Inn Lane&mdash;yes&mdash;going
along Liquorpond Street, Gray's Inn Lane&mdash;at 
about eight o'clock in the morning&mdash;and
saw the fire break out of Mr. Stephenson's

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

windows. This, gentlemen of the jury, is a
very remarkable fact&mdash;and in connexion with
some other circumstances to which we shall
presently come, is quite worthy of your particular 
attention&mdash;you perceive that he swears
to eight o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"Evening, my Lord," said Mr. Flappertrap,
standing up and whispering his Lordship audibly.</p>

<p>"Evening, is it?" said his Lordship&mdash;"aye,
so it is&mdash;evening&mdash;no matter&mdash;he swears to the
time at which he saw the fire break out&mdash;and
hence will naturally arise in your minds a chain
of circumstances which it will be my duty to
endeavour to unravel. In the first place&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hereabouts one of the servants of the Court
put his head in at one of the doors at the
back of the bench, and whispered the Lord
Mayor much after the manner in which Mr.
Flappertrap had just before whispered the
Judge. His Lordship immediately pulled out
his watch&mdash;then looked at the clock&mdash;and then
wrote a few words upon a slip of paper, and

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

laid that slip of paper upon his Lordship's
notes. The Judge took up the memorandum,
and tore it in pieces&mdash;as I thought indignantly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know what that means?" said my
friend, the sheriff.</p>

<p>"No," said I.</p>

<p>"Dinner's waiting," replied my friend&mdash;an
announcement which startled me, as it seemed
impossible but that it would be kept waiting
for some time. This little scene, however,
was followed by the arrival of the Recorder,
who after bowing to the Lord Mayor, took his
seat on the bench.</p>

<p>"I told you so," said the sheriff, "Mr.
Recorder is come to try the remaining cases&mdash;"
A cry of "Silence&mdash;pray, silence," indicated
that Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury and I were speaking 
somewhat too loudly.</p>

<p>"The circumstances to which I allude,"
continued his Lordship, after he had torn up
the note, "are in fact so clearly detailed in the
evidence you have heard, that to men of intelligence 

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

and experience, like those I am now
addressing, any attempt at explanation on my
part, would be superfluous. The case appears
a very clear one&mdash;you have to decide upon the
value of the evidence, and return your verdict
accordingly, giving the prisoner the benefit of
any doubts you may entertain on the question."</p>

<p>Never was I more surprised than at finding
the promised explanations and comparisons of
facts and testimony so suddenly cut short, after
the manner of "the story of the bear and
fiddle," and I could not help, while the clerk
of the arraigns was putting his accustomed
question to the jury, noticing the circumstance
to my worshipful friend.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the sheriff, "don't you
see&mdash;the time is up&mdash;he smells the marrow
puddings."</p>

<p>The jury, emulating the expedition of the
Judge, in one minute, according to the zig-zag
system, acquitted the prisoner; whereupon, his
Lordship rising to depart, addressed that individual 
in words to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, you have been tried
by an able, patient, and conscientious jury of
your countrymen, who, convinced like myself
of the enormity of your crime, and of the
wicked intentions by which you were actuated
in its commission, have returned the only verdict 
which they could justly and honestly return&mdash;they 
have well discharged their duty. And
although it is not <i>my</i> province in this place to
pronounce the awful sentence of the law upon
you, I shall take care&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Flappertrap whispered his Lordship 
that the jury had acquitted the prisoner.</p>

<p>"By and bye, Sir," said his Lordship, angry
at being interrupted&mdash;"I shall take care, young
man, that an example shall be made in your
person, of the&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor here ventured to suggest
that the "young man" was found <i>not</i> guilty.</p>

<p>"Very well, my Lord&mdash;presently, presently,"
said his Lordship&mdash;"even-handedness of justice; 
and that an enormous offender of your
class may not be suffered to escape the just

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

vengeance of the laws which he has outraged."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Flappertrap whipped a bit of paper
over the desk of the bench, into the very place
which the announcement of dinner had so recently 
occupied. His Lordship looked at it,
and exclaimed, unconsciously&mdash;"Oh! ah!&mdash;umph!" 
and then continued&mdash;"It is true that
upon the present occasion the mercy and forbearance 
of the jury have been exercised in a
signal manner; and I trust their benevolence
and indulgence will not be thrown away upon
you. I maintain my own opinion still&mdash;yet
they have decided, and I have only to receive
that decision&mdash;you are discharged, Sir, and may
go about your business: but I can tell you
this, young man, you have had a very narrow
escape indeed."</p>

<p>There was not a man in Court who did not
tacitly admit the truth and justice of at least
the concluding passage of his Lordship's address 
to the acquitted prisoner; nor was that
individual himself the least astonished of his

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

Lordship's auditors. The incident, however, was
worthy of its place in the day's proceedings, as
producing a climax to the judicial operations of
the learned Lord, and leaving upon the minds
of all his Majesty's liege subjects then and
there present, a conviction that however classical 
it may be to picture Justice blind, it is
not, as a matter of convenience and utility, at
all desirable that she should also be deaf.</p>

<p>The signal for our departure having been
given, I proceeded with my friend the sheriff to
ascend the stairs which led to the dining-room.
When we reached the apartment, which was at
the top of the building, we found several persons
already assembled, and in conversation with
the ordinary, who were come to partake of the
dinner, but whose taste did not lead them to
listen to the trials in Court; four or five barristers 
soon joined the group, and in a few minutes 
we sat down to the repast, which was more
plentiful than splendid, and in which the much
vaunted marrow puddings displayed themselves
conspicuously. The Lord Mayor took the head

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

of the table, and the Chaplain placed himself
at the foot of it. I sat between my friend and
patron the sheriff and Mr. Flappertrap, whose
proceedings below stairs had attracted a very
considerable share of my attention. I found
him pleasant and full of anecdote&mdash;the Chaplain
cut jokes innumerable&mdash;the Lord Mayor was
absolutely droll&mdash;and the venerable Judge himself 
laughed at some anecdotes which were told
him, till tears ran down his venerable cheeks.</p>

<p>Strange contrast!&mdash;five minutes before, these
people had been below dispensing the law to the
people, deciding the fates and fortunes of their
fellow-men, raising or destroying the hopes of
the doubting trembling friends and relatives of
those arraigned before them; and now&mdash;their
spirits having risen progressively with themselves 
to the top of the same building&mdash;there
they were, eating, drinking, and laughing, as
if the dinner, of which they were partaking,
was, in point of fact, the only cause or reason
for their assembling.</p>

<p>The feast went on&mdash;some of the barristers

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

departed for the Court&mdash;the Chaplain "passed
the wine," and the conversation became general
as the party diminished, when one of the servants 
announced to his reverence that "the
yeoman of the halter" had just arrived from
Wales. The style and title of this officer was
new to me; and when a stout beetle-browed
man entered the room, and made a low bow,
I inquired of my friend the sheriff what part
in the play he performed?</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Scraggs," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I&mdash;"but what is yeoman of the
halter?"</p>

<p>"A joke," said the sheriff&mdash;"what you and
the unlearned, call Jack Ketch!"</p>

<p>I felt a mingled sensation of surprise, and I
must admit horror, at being in the same room
with this most dreadful functionary. That feeling 
wore off when I found the sheriff, the
under-sheriff, and even the Lord Mayor himself 
recognise him. The Chaplain, who was
always destined to participate with him in the
performance of the last scene upon the scaffold, 

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

filled a glass of wine and handed it to
him.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Yeoman," said his reverence;
"you have been out of town some time?"</p>

<p>"Five veeks altogether. Doctor," said Scraggs;
"I vent down, you know, into Vales, for the
first job; but there vas a respit which kept me
back a fortnight."</p>

<p>"It is a curious fact," said the Chaplain,
addressing himself to me, "but in the case to
which the yeoman refers, he was obliged to go
down to Carmarthen to hang a horse-stealer,
because not a native of the principality could be
found to perform that duty on a Welshman."</p>

<p>"Quite true, Sir," said Scraggs; "howsomever, 
I had two executions besides that, durin'
the time I was out; one at Hereford, and another
at Gloucester, they both vent off uncommon vell:
it has been beautiful weather the whole time,
and I don't think I ever spent so pleasant a five
veeks in all my life."</p>

<p>The yeoman having finished his wine, put
his glass upon a side table, made a bow to the

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

company, and retired, about which time arrived
the Recorder, and two or three barristers; this
seemed to be the signal for a general move, and
I suggested to my friend, the Sheriff, a return
to the Court: this, however, was a vain proposition, 
for it was almost immediately announced
that the last trial was on, and that the Common
Sergeant had relieved the learned Recorder,
who was to arrange the various sentences of the
prisoners, which yet remained undecided, after
which ceremony, we should all go into Court
and hear the sentences pronounced.</p>

<p>It was by a peculiarly happy concatenation of
circumstances that I was enabled to see all these
features of civic justice combined. The Judge,
however, as soon as the Recorder made his appearance, 
rose from table&mdash;we all did the same&mdash;they 
remained in conversation for some time,
when his Lordship bowed to the company, and
retired, accompanied by the Lord Mayor and
one or two of the guests. The Recorder then
assumed the presidential chair, and we began
the afternoon afresh. The Chaplain pushed

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

round the wine&mdash;the butler placed glasses before
the Recorder, together with pens and ink, and
a long book-like paper, which I found to be the
calendar. At his right hand sat one of the city
pleaders, and on his left, the clerk of arraigns,
who had joined our party at the same period
with his Lordship.</p>

<p>The learned Judge having placed his spectacles 
on his nose, began to peruse the names and
crimes which this book of fate contained, and to
apportion to each culprit tried that day, such
quantum of punishment as he might seem to
deserve.</p>

<p>"No. 174," read his Lordship. "Martha
Hickman&mdash;stealing pewter pots&mdash;what shall we
say, Mr. Drawley? Gentlemen, I have the
pleasure to drink all your very good healths.&mdash;Why, 
Mr. Butler&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My Lord."</p>

<p>"What wine is this?"</p>

<p>"The same wine your Lordship always
drinks," said Mr. Butler; for every office in
the City, which is not dignified with a lordly

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

title, is designated at once by its name, to which
is prefixed Mister&mdash;for instance, the Lord
Mayor's mace-bearer, and sword-bearer, are
uniformly called, as indeed they call each other,
"Mr. Mace," and "Mr. Sword,"&mdash;so Mr. Butler.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Sir," said his Lordship;
"this is sour, bad, wishy washy stuff&mdash;not fit to
be drunk."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, my Lord "</p>

<p>"Sorry!" said his Lordship; "what signifies
being sorry, Sir&mdash;you should take care in the
first instance to have proper wine put down."</p>

<p>"I will change it, my Lord, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Change it!" said the Recorder; "to be
sure, Sir&mdash;change it directly! It won't do, Sir.
This sort of thing has happened before&mdash;get
some other wine, Sir, directly!"</p>

<p>This command was delivered in a tone of
thunder, preceded by a flash of lightning from
the eye of the irritated Judge, who then fell to
work upon the calendar.</p>

<p>"Martha Hickman, stealing three pewter
pots&mdash;seven years' transportation."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

<p>"Robert Hayes, stealing three fowls, one
duck, and a doe rabbit&mdash;fourteen years, I think,
eh, Mr. Drawley&mdash;yes&mdash;fourteen' years&mdash;have
you marked him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord."</p>

<p>"Harriet Richards, stealing four yards of
linen&mdash;Richards? was not that the woman with
the cap and ribbons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord."</p>

<p>"That was a hanging cap," said his Lordship;
"hardened woman&mdash;two years' imprisonment."</p>

<p>"Walter Cutts, stealing two loaves&mdash;seven
years for him, I think. Did you ever taste such
stuff as that wine, Mr. Ordinary?"</p>

<p>"My Lord."</p>

<p>"You have not been drinking any of that
bottle, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord," said the Chaplain; "it is
corked."</p>

<p>"It never should have been uncorked here,
Mr. Ordinary," said the Judge; "it is an absolute 
insult.&mdash;Well&mdash;Stephen Robinson, for stealing 
two pewter pots&mdash;upon my honour it is

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

enough to bring on a cholera morbus&mdash;Robinson,
seven years' transportation. Vinegar would be
just as palatable. Rachel Marsh, fourteen years&mdash;abominable 
woman. Simon Warner, pair of
boots, umph&mdash;oh, I recollect that case&mdash;transportation 
for life. Well, Sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will your Lordship please to try this," said
Mr. Butler, proffering a new bottle. His Lordship, 
still muttering indignation, filled his glass,
and after smelling its <i>bouquet</i>, and looking at its
brightness, swallowed the contents. "Ah," said
his Lordship, "this is something like wine&mdash;why 
did not you give us this at first, Mr.
Butler? Fill my glass again&mdash;hand it round&mdash;you'll 
find that, Mr. Ordinary, quite another
sort of thing&mdash;excellent, excellent wine indeed.
Well, let us finish our business. Robert Holland, 
stealing fourteen gold watches, thirty-four
gold chains, six time-keepers, and sundry loose
diamonds, oh&mdash;in a dwelling-house&mdash;well, let's
say three months for him&mdash;capital wine, isn't
it, Mr. Clerk&mdash;capital. Roger Perkins, three
mares and a foal&mdash;six weeks' imprisonment.

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

Anne Griffiths, administering poison to her
mother, aunt, and two sisters&mdash;poor girl&mdash;case
of mistake, eh&mdash;pass that bottle, Mr. Ordinary
&mdash;what shall we say&mdash;childish carelessness&mdash;one
month. Simmons, cow&mdash;oh&mdash;line one shilling
and discharge&mdash;that's the last&mdash;the last."</p>

<p>Never was I more convinced of a man's wisdom 
than I was at this moment of that of the
foreman of the Grand Jury, who had expatiated
so elaborately on the effect of irritating circumstances, 
acting upon the mind while it is employed 
in the dispensation of justice. As a
sequel to the decisions of the Jury, it appeared
to me that the apportionment of punishment
was incomparable; however, for the scene that
was immediately to follow, I own I was not
prepared.</p>

<p>Just as the Judge had concluded the "catalogue 
of crime," it was announced that the
last trial was over, and that the Court was
waiting for his Lordship to pronounce sentence
upon the convicted prisoners. The company
rose and followed his Lordship down stairs to

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

the Court&mdash;I resumed my seat upon the bench,
wholly unconscious of the nature of the spectacle 
which was so soon to absorb my attention.</p>

<p>The whole place had assumed a different
aspect since I had left it&mdash;it was now night,
and the lights were burning dimly in their
sockets&mdash;a profound silence reigned, and every
eye was directed towards the door by which the
prisoners, classified before their arrival, were to
enter the dock. After the lapse of some minutes 
of suspense, a motley crowd pressed forward 
towards the bar&mdash;sobs and groans were
heard&mdash;and faint cries, which evidently proceeded 
from those relations of the culprits, to
whom, fallen and debased as they were, they
were yet devoted in affection.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" said I to Bucklesbury.</p>

<p>"These are the capital convicts&mdash;you'll hear
in a moment," was the reply.</p>

<p>And I did hear&mdash;one of the most awful addresses 
ever made to guilty creatures, delivered
by the Judge, who but a few moments before had
seemed to me to be of the world, worldly. It

<!-- vol 2 page 98 -->

appeared as if he had become suddenly inspired
with an almost unearthly dignity and power.
His voice deep and impressive, his language
forcible and eloquent; the purport of his dread
appeal, and its termination, never will be effaced
from my memory. And when, in conclusion,
amidst their wailings and supplications, he
passed the awful sentence of the law upon his
fellow-creatures, and in dooming them to death,
prayed for mercy on their souls, I fell back
in a state of insensibility, wholly overcome by
my feelings, much, as I subsequently perceived,
to the amusement of one of the under-sheriffs
(a small attorney), who, at a later period of
the evening, whether in order to enjoy a joke
at my expense, or to affect the hospitable, I
do not know, told me that he supposed, as I
had heard the sentences, I might like to witness 
the execution of those who were to die,
in which case, he should be glad to see me
whenever the day was fixed; adding, with an
expression of peculiar <i>bonhommie</i>, "we hang at
eight, and breakfast at nine."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

<p>There can be no question that a constant familiarization 
with such scenes blunts the feelings,
if it does not harden the heart. The butcher's
wife, who bribed her baby to take physic by
promising, if it were a good child, that it
should stick a lamb the next morning, saw
nothing revolting in the idea of killing that, by
the death of which, she lived. To show to what
an extent experience in horrors deprives them
of their effect, I may mention the following
fact, related to me many years after this period,
by a friend.</p>

<p>When the traitor Thistlewood and his murderous 
gang of accomplices were to be executed
before Newgate, my friend, whose taste lay
that way, secured a window to witness the catastrophe. 
The sentence included decapitation
after death; and when the executioner commenced 
his work by cutting off the head of
Thistlewood, and holding it up to the people
as the head of a traitor, a shudder of horror
thrilled through the crowd. The second similar
operation upon the next culprit produced a similar 

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

effect, but in a slighter degree; and so
completely did that feeling wear off as the performance 
of duty proceeded, that when, in the
executioner lifting the head of the seventh
traitor, as the preceding six had been lifted
to the public gaze, happened to let it fall,
cries of "Ah, clumsy"&mdash;"halloo butter fingers," 
were heard from various quarters of the
assembly.</p>

<p>The awful denunciation of offended justice
from the lips of the Judge, certainly did not
produce upon the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> the effect it had
upon me. To the passing of the minor sentences 
I listened with composure, and I confess
that when I heard Robert Hayes sentenced to
fourteen years' transportation for stealing two
ducks and a doe rabbit, and Anne Griffiths
saddled with a month's imprisonment for endeavouring 
to poison all her existing relatives, 
I could not help thinking of the butler's 
corked bottle and the foreman's smoky
chimney.</p>

<p>When the Court rose, I shook hands with

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

my new friend the sheriff; and having taken
a glass of hot brandy and water with the Ordinary, 
which he recommended as a correction
for the indisposition produced by my sensibility,
I quitted the Sessions House, amused and
amazed by what I had seen and heard; and
most of all astonished that I had actually existed
eight hours without once thinking of my beloved 
Emma<span class="sup">1</span>!</p>

<p class="small">[<span class="sup">1</span>It is but just to observe, that this picture of the Old Bailey,
sketched by my late friend, and not intended for the public
eye, although essentially correct, bears evident marks of caricature. 
Mr. Gurney was at the time a young man, and ready
enough to catch the ludicrous wherever it was to be found.
Certainly, at the present time, the Court in question presents
a very different appearance, and possesses a very different
character.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.]</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> anxiety about Daly, and his proceedings
in my behalf, began greatly to increase. He
had been now gone a week, and I had heard
nothing, although according to his own vivid
anticipations I was to be actually affianced to
Emma in three days after his arrival at Tenby;&mdash;at 
least, I might have been apprised of his
arrival, and of the posture of affairs at the
opening of the campaign. I went to his
lodgings, but Redmond had heard no more than
I. I returned thence, therefore, as ignorant
and dispirited as when I went; and as usual
whiled away half an hour at the door of Mrs.
Fletcher Green's carriage, which I met in Piccadilly, 
and which she caused to be drawn up

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

close to the <i>trottoir</i>, in order to accomplish our
little <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. She kindly renewed her invitation, 
but I was living in a sort of perpetual
worry, and felt unable to mix in society any
longer. I excused myself, therefore, by a plea
of going into the country, which I palliated
with a hope that I should have the pleasure of
seeing her on my return, and a promise that
hers should be the first door I knocked at upon
my arrival in London.</p>

<p>When I parted from her, I felt that it was
quite impossible any longer to mistake the
nature of the sentiment she entertained towards 
me; and this very conviction increased
my difficulties and embarrassments. Nobody who
has not been placed in circumstances similar to
those in which I then found myself&mdash;but I suppose 
almost everybody has&mdash;can at all understand 
the sort of misty maze which life appeared
at that period. The sameness and tastelessness
of everything disconnected with the one great
object of my life&mdash;were, I must own, mixed with
self-reproach to a very considerable extent, for

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

having committed my affairs to the hands of so
volatile a minister as Daly.</p>

<p>It was not until the morning of the eighth
day from his departure that I received a letter
from my ambassador, not from Tenby, but from
Malvern Wells, whither it appeared he had followed 
my charming dulcinea. However, the
shortest way of connecting my adventures and
proceedings with a history of my own time,
will be to insert his various communications
upon this interesting subject in their proper
places. No. 1. of the Correspondence immediately 
follows:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="right"><i>Malvern</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Gurney</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the date of this, you will see that I
have had a sharp chase after your fair friends.
My proceedings since we parted would make
a valuable addition to the classical stories of
Mr. Lane, of the Minerva Press, Leadenhall
Street&mdash;they have been varied and curious&mdash;but 
I fear to you, who have but one object in
view, will not be particularly interesting.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

<p>I slept at Oxford the night I left town, supped
with some old friends at the Mitre, sallied forth
and met the Vice-Chancellor returning from
supper over Magdalen Bridge,&mdash;we who were
all somewhat elevated, thought it quite right to
elevate <i>him</i>, and accordingly we hoisted him on
our shoulders, and having crowned him with a
lamp cover, carried him home to Baliol, at the
gate of which we deposited him, having luckily
met with interruption neither from Proctor
nor bull dog. I ought perhaps to premise, that
having arrived at about five, I went to wine
at Brasenose, with a most admirable person,
called in these parts. Sober Tom; and while in
his rooms, a fancy came into my head, that the
blowing up of Cain and Abel, who stand cheek
by jowl, in the middle of the quadrangle,
would be excellent fun. Accordingly, having
the <i>quoi faire</i> in my coat pocket, as soon as
it grew dark, and before we adjourned to our
episcopal inn, I deposited one of my exploding
grenades in a luckily discovered crack in the
pedestal, gave him three quarters of a hour's

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

fuse, and just as we were clear of the rose,
bang he went, and the unnatural brothers were
regularly floored upon the grass-plot, much to
the edification of four unhappy devils who were
locked up in a room over the gateway fagging
for a fellowship.</p>

<p>To me these freaks are admirable jests; for,
not belonging to the University, I care nothing
for taking the active direction of exploits for
the performance of which I am not amenable
to the heads or tails here, while my intimacy
with some score of the hardiest young fellows
in Oxford, gives me, at least, as far as mischief
goes, an <i>esprit du corps</i> highly to be commended.</p>

<p>Do not for a moment imagine, that these
parenthetical pranks were permitted for a moment 
to interfere with your interests. A man
must sleep somewhere; and after Dow Wolf's
exhausting receiver of Friday, I assure you I
felt a halt at the end of the first fifty miles
absolutely necessary to my comfort, although I
could not endure the idea of being a night in

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

Oxford without exercising my native ingenuity
during the course of the evening.</p>

<p>Our supper was excellent&mdash;nine of us&mdash;all as
sober as judges when we broke up; which circumstance, 
however, did not hinder me from
performing one feat with unqualified dexterity.
An elderly gentleman, in a shovel hat, with a
fat wife and a fair daughter, was toddling up
by easy stages from Wales for advice from the
London doctors, and was lodged in the room
on the first floor immediately under us. The
worthy shovel sent at least a dozen messages
up to implore and entreat we would make
less noise&mdash;an imprudence on his part not
to be altogether overlooked. About eleven
he went to bed in dismay, in the back room,
with the bed-room within it, in which the bright-eyed 
damsel of a daughter was herself duly
deposited out of harm's way. As we came
down from our sitting-room, I heard the invalid
shovel snoring a duet with his exemplary and
obese partner. Up I ran into the room immediately 
over his head, and in the twinkling

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

of an eye turned up three half-tester beds right
on end, in which were sleeping two strapping
chambermaids and a kitchen wench, and having
poised them thus, banged to the bed-room door,
which instantly awakened the reversed damsels,
who startled at the noise, jumped, as they
thought, <i>up</i> in their beds, which had precisely
the <i>reverse</i> effect, namely, that of bringing the
three bedsteads simultaneously to the floor, with
a noise which would have roused Somnus himself, 
if he had condescended to take up his
lodging under the hospitable roof of our friend
Peake.</p>

<p>A dreadful peal of laughter which succeeded
the explosion, must at once have satisfied the
disturbed travellers whence the uproar proceeded, 
and of course quieted their apprehensions, 
that as Macbeth's friend says, "where
they lay last night, the chimneys were blown
down."</p>

<p>The next day I pursued my journey&mdash;rattled
through Cheltenham&mdash;to me the most odious
place in England&mdash;what it may be twenty

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

years hence, I don't pretend to say&mdash;now it is
a bad edition of Hammersmith&mdash;reached Gloucester 
by half past three, and found myself
housed at the Angel at Abergavenny a little
before nine, having done my ninety-three miles
in eleven hours and a half, which in these parts
I call going. Those who live to see steam
coaches, and steam boats, and air balloons, in
general use, may perhaps sneer at the pace;
but as neither you nor I are likely to endure
till the age of hot water and hydrogen gas, it
is as well to be contented with what we have
in the way of speed.</p>

<p>Would that I could have kept up at the same
rate; but no&mdash;the roads grew bad, the horses
worse, and I had a heavy day's work of it to
get to Caermarthen by half past one o'clock on
Sunday morning. At Caermarthen I resolved
to pitch my tent, and roosted, as owls are said
to do, in the Ivy Bush. Nothing particular
occurred there; and about half past eleven in
the day, I proceeded to the pretty little town
which we fancied contained your jewel beyond

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

price. I reached the White Lion, and began my
inquiries amidst the ringing of bells, which distracted 
me, but of which I subsequently found
myself the unconscious cause. Remember, I
don't mean house-bells, for the White Lion boasts
no such luxury&mdash;I mean the church-bells, which
were set going in their merriest peals to do me
honour, for which, in the sequel, I found one
pound one shilling set down in the bill under
the head of "ringers;" but a little <i>&eacute;clat</i> is worth
paying for, if one have but the money.</p>

<p>Well, my dear friend, having brought you to
the White Lion, or rather having brought myself 
there, I sallied forth in quest of our family&mdash;feasted 
my eyes on the beauties of the place,
admired the elegance of Sir William Paxton's
baths&mdash;detected an old naval friend of mine patiently 
playing billiards with a very sensible-looking 
gentleman, at a table which stood on an
inclined plane; so that the skill of the game
consisted rather in keeping the balls out of the
left-hand corner bottom pocket than putting
them into any of the others&mdash;Began my inquiries 

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

with <i>him</i>&mdash;"place full&mdash;many families
there&mdash;who were the leaders?" He was as innocent 
as a sheet of white paper&mdash;knew nothing
except a report of Milford Haven being about
to be adopted by government as a naval station.
I pitied and left him, and proceeded to the
apology for a library, which I entered. In a
subscription-book lying on the counter, I read
over a list of the fashionables who graced the
place&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. and three Misses Evans,
Mr. Hugh Jones, Mr. David Jones, and Miss
Jones, Mr. Mrs. and Master and Miss Morgan,
Captain and Mrs. Rice, Mr. and Mrs. Leek, and
Miss Leek, Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths, Dr. Roderick
Jones, Colonel and Mrs. Williams, Mr. Jenkins
Jones, of Cwmdblrowmgytty, and family; Mrs.
Price Price Morgan Rees of Mmllabyth, and
a vast many other similar names filled the
pages&mdash;but no Haineses. I thought this odd,
and therefore ventured to push my inquiries
to the librarian. He put his finger, first on his
forehead, then on his nose, and then on his lip;
and, turning to a very pretty rosy-cheeked girl,

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

said, "Weren't those people's name Haines who
had Evan Thomas's house?" "Indeed to God
it was," said the girl. "That's it, Sir," said
the librarian, " 'deed is it; they have been gone
away these three weeks, Sir&mdash;a lady and a
daughter."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said I;&mdash;"now can you tell
me whither they went?"</p>

<p>"That I can't indeed," said the librarian;
"but if you will let me send over to Evan
Thomas, I have no doubt he will know."</p>

<p>My permission was soon granted, and the
information soon gained&mdash;the Haineses had
gone to Malvern; where, for all Mr. Evan
Thomas knew, they were still sojourning. Of
course, I made every preparation for pursuing
them to that lovely spot in the morning; taking,
however, the opportunity of a delightful evening
to abstract the linchpins from all the bathing-machines 
which were ranged under the cliff;
for which little mental and bodily exertion,
I was amply repaid before my departure by
beholding the actual overthrow of three of the

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

said machines during their progress to the sea,
and the consequent ejectment of three fair tenants 
in a state of inconceivable distress; not to
speak of two others of the vehicles, which when
I first opened my window at the White Lion,
were lying on their sides on the beach, looking
like a brace of dead elephants.</p>

<p>Refreshed by breakfast and the success of
my exploit, I started from Tenby; but as I
met with no adventure of any importance, and
more especially as I am quite convinced that
you are more anxious to hear of my arrival at
Malvern than any thing else, I shall say not a
word as to my journey thither&mdash;or rather, hither&mdash;which 
I safely concluded about five o'clock in
the afternoon of my second day.</p>

<p>I was driven to the Well House, where I
determined to fix my head-quarters at all
events; and in less than ten minutes had ascertained 
that Mrs. Haines and her fair daughter
were actually inmates of that delightful tenement. 
Nothing could so charmingly facilitate
plans like those which I had laid&mdash;in the mornings, 

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

noons, breakfasts, afternoons, and evenings, 
we should be associated&mdash;domesticated
together at breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, and
suppers, in walks and in drives, in loungings
and in lollings, in talkings and singings; in
short, in every amusement, pursuit, or recreation, 
occupiers of the same tenement, members
of the same family.</p>

<p>It must be evident, that nothing can so entirely 
conduce to the accomplishment of my
project, as the fortunate circumstance of their
having settled here. Except at Harrowgate,
I know of no other watering-place where the
whole population are cooped up together; all
the difficulties of introduction are overcome, and
you will, I am sure, be delighted to hear that,
although I lose no time in reporting progress,
having been here not more than twelve hours,
I am already on speaking terms with the
Haineses, <i>m&egrave;re et fille</i>.</p>

<p>At the table, where all the company meet at
meals, the promotion is progressive&mdash;the last
comer sits lowest, and thus upon a Tontine

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

principle, the longest survivor gets the highest
place&mdash;a shaky admiral and his rigid wife are
the monarchs at present; opposite to them, and
of the same standing, are a deaf Lord and his
pretty niece; and next to the admiral on the
right hand side, come Mrs. Haines and her daughter. 
The company below the salt are chiefly old
and invalids; but there are some gay rollicking
folks who appear to annoy the sicklies by their
liveliness and laughter, the old hands seeming
to think, because Malvern air and Malvern
water have been recommended for "<i>their</i>" complaints, 
that Malvern Well House is to be converted 
into a sort of hospital. Here is one
sweet girl under the <i>tutelage</i> of her aunt. They
are more recent arrivals, and are therefore
nearer me at table; in the evening of yesterday
we got very sociable, and she sang that exquisite 
song of Moore's, "Dearest love, I'll not
forget thee," like a syren&mdash;Aunty looked suspicious 
at <i>me</i>&mdash;why, I cannot understand&mdash;I
am all innocence, if people would but trust me.</p>

<p>I carefully watched your Emma&mdash;she appears 

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

pale, and I think out of spirits&mdash;I must
approach with care and caution&mdash;nothing ruins
an affair like flurrying a gentle creature such
as she seems to be&mdash;a sudden surprise sometimes 
excites them into an exclamation;&mdash;one 
scream would upset all my operations, and
perhaps produce my expulsion from the community; 
for Mrs. Steer, mine hostess, is a very
dragon in the way of prudence and propriety.
There is a Captain Meriden, who seems to
talk to Emma more than anybody else, but
she is shy and retiring in her manner, and
from the ease with which she converses with,
evidently cares nothing about him.</p>

<p>Major M'Guffin, of the grenadier school, is,
however, more attentive to your future mother-in-law; 
the style and manner of their living&mdash;the 
gay servants&mdash;the smart carriage&mdash;the
glossy horses&mdash;the well-dressed maid&mdash;all bespeak 
the snug and comfortable; and although
as the gallant gentleman has not, in all probability, 
had the advantages which we have derived
from Doctors' Commons, he may imagine that

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

he might console the widow for the loss of the
late Mr. Haines, and at the same time render
himself, as the husband of Mrs. M'Guffin, extremely 
comfortable for the rest of his days&mdash;rely 
upon it he will be disappointed. Another
week will see me on terms of the most entire
confidence with the ladies, and I will stake my
existence that before a fortnight is over, our
affair will be concluded.</p>

<p>We have some extraordinary characters here,
but I know too well the nature of your complaint 
to fancy that I could interest or even
divert you for a moment by a description of
them. It is curious to see, for English people,
how sociable they get in this Well House. It
is the constant association, the necessity, as it
were, of making society, that produces this&mdash;the 
elders play whist in a room on one side the
hall, while the juniors play the piano-forte and
the fool on the other: I ought, however, just to
tell you, that, on the night of my arrival, I
discovered that the bed-room candles belonging
to all the guests are placed upon a table behind

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

a screen in one corner of the saloon, so that
each person after supper&mdash;for as we dine at
three, that conciliating meal is considered absolutely 
essential to our existence&mdash;each person
can depart at pleasure and all&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Without hurry, or bustle, or care."</p>

</div>

<p>the moment I made this acquisition of knowledge 
as to the localities, I took the precaution
of dipping the ends of every candle&mdash;muttons,
I give you my honour&mdash;into a basin of water,
which I found in their company on the table,
and which seemed to have been placed there on
purpose to tempt me; the result was, on the
departure of the first squad of tabbies&mdash;for like
fruit on a tree, in a place like this, the most
matured drop off first&mdash;there arose such a
spitting and sputtering behind the screen, that
one would have fancied a magnificent display
of fireworks had been going on&mdash;or rather off&mdash;in 
the distance, during which experiment, accompanied 
by the lamentations of the venerable
sisterhood, Major M'Guffin kept his great green

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

eyes immoveably fixed upon me,&mdash;whether he
only suspected me as the author of the mischief,
or favoured by his unusual height, had looked
over the screen, and seen me at work, I could
not then make out, nor have I since discovered;
nevertheless and notwithstanding, I flatter myself 
I am upon the whole, popular.</p>

<p>As for Emma, your description did not do
her half justice&mdash;I think her perfection&mdash;her
eyes are all eloquence, and the gracefulness of
her manner is incomparable. Mrs. H. is not
quite what I expected, I dare say of a very
domestic turn of mind, but somehow&mdash;not that
I flinch from my bargain if it can in any
way contribute to the success of <i>our</i> scheme.
I have no time for more; assure yourself of a
despatch the moment I have made any effective
advance; in the mean time, keep up your spirits,
and believe me, as I truly am,</p>

<p class="right">Yours most faithfully,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. F. Daly</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>The receipt of this communication gave me

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

great contentment, inasmuch as it not only
dissipated all the apprehensions I had formed
of my friend's possible neglect of his mission
in the pursuit of some strange vagary of his
own, but because it afforded me intelligence of
negatively satisfactory character, in telling me,
that Emma, if torn from <i>me</i> by her anxious
parent, was at least free from the persecutions
of any other regularly received suitor; and as
I never entirely believed in the seriousness of
Daly's intentions with regard to Mrs. Haines,
it mattered little to me whether Major M'Guffin's 
attentions were in earnest or not, or
indeed, whether they might or might not prove
acceptable to her.</p>

<p>Somewhat composed therefore, by this communication, 
I accepted an invitation to dine at
Lady Wolverhampton's to meet Mrs. Fletcher
Green and her young companion, whom I now
discovered to be her sister. Miss Carter&mdash;Catherine 
Carter, and several extremely agreeable 
persons. It was rather a blue party, but
Mrs. Fletcher Green contrived to enliven it,

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

and with her honied words overcame the flavour
of the prussic acid, which otherwise would have
predominated; some people sang, some played
cards, some recited poetry in one room, and
others diverted themselves at the more interesting
game of lotto, at which I must confess the noble
hostess seemed not only very much amused, but
particularly successful; indeed, Mrs. Fletcher
Green appeared to have such confidence in her
ladyship's luck that she neither would join the
party herself, nor suffer her sister nor me (for
whom her manifestations of kindness were unequivocal), 
to participate in its alluring pleasures.</p>

<p>"<i>Ogni medaglia ha il suo reverso</i>," says the
Italian proverb,&mdash;I was this evening destined to
appreciate its truth, and I am even now almost
ashamed to admit how deeply I felt, that the
next morning was fixed for Mrs. Fletcher
Green's departure from town on a visit to a
Lord and Lady somebody, whose name I have
forgotten, somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Windsor, and where she was to stay for a
week or eight days, during which period Ascot

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

races, I believe, were to occur. I am sorry to
say that whatever compliments my taste might
deserve for my admiration of this fascinating
woman, my stability of purpose, and constancy of
mind, were not to be highly lauded. However,
the chances were, that upon her return to town,
I should be irrevocably parted from her, as far
as any tenderer feeling than that of friendship
was concerned, although I did not despair by
the access of fortune which would accompany
my union with Emma, to establish her and
myself in such a position in society as would
render us the worthy entertainers of my agreeable 
friend and her sister, under what I hoped
would be always found, our hospitable roof.</p>

<p>Well, away went the evening&mdash;and away
went Mrs. Fletcher Green and her sister, and
at length away went I, not knowing what the
next day would produce, and living in a state of
nervousness entirely indescribable.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival at my lodgings, I found an
invitation written in the most delicate hand,
and in minute characters, from my friend Hull,

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

to dine with the Worshipful Company of Tooth-pick 
Makers, who were to have their annual
feast at the Crown and Sceptre at Greenwich,
to which he, being, I suppose one of the worshipful 
fraternity, had the privilege of taking a
friend: I was puzzled whether to struggle against
a desire to mix in society, with the peculiarities
of which I could never, without the aid of my civic
and mercantile friend, become acquainted, or to
give up the conflict, and abandon myself to the
solitude which I was sure would be most congenial 
to my feelings&mdash;I thought with Thompson,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"I want to be alone, to find some shade,
Some solitary gloom: there to shake off
These harsh tumultuous cares that vex my life,
This sick ambition on itself recoiling:
And there to listen to the gentle voice.
The sigh of Peace&mdash;something&mdash;I know not what
That whispers transport to my heart."</p>

</div>

<p>Yet after all, why should I brood and nestle
over my sorrow&mdash;I hesitated&mdash;but then, I had
been interested and excited at the Old Bailey,
why should I not seek solace from the Crown
and Sceptre at Greenwich. I debated the "to
be or not to be," for half an hour, and at

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

last resolved to see, what I had never seen,
a public dinner, and which I little doubted had
its attractions, and its oddities. I accordingly
wrote an answer to my friend Hull, accepting
his kind bidding, and promising, as he desired,
to be rigidly punctual to six o'clock.</p>

<p>Of all things in the world a "daylight
dinner" is the most detestable of all operations.
I remember being so struck with its peculiar
<i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i>, that although my heart was then
little attuned to the gay school of poetry, I could
not help venting my spleen, and the detestation
which I felt for the blaze of sunlight glaring
into the Greenwich tavern windows, made more
brilliant by reflection from the water, in some
lines, the entire copy of which, I have lost, but
of which the following are fragments.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">When Summer's smiles rejoice the plains,
    And deck the vale with flow'rs;
And blushing nymphs, and gentle swains,
    With love beguile the hours:
Oh! then conceive the ills that mock
    The well-dressed London sinner,
Invited just at seven o'clock
    To join a "daylight dinner."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

<p class="stanza">The sun, no trees the eye to shade,
    Glares full into the windows,
And scorches widow, wife, and maid,
    Just as it does the Hindoos;
One's shoes look brown, one's black looks grey,
    One's legs if thin, look thinner,
There's nothing equals, in its way,
    A London daylight dinner.</p>

<p class="stanza">The cloth seems blue, the plate's like lead,
    The faded carpet dirty.
Grey hairs peep out from each dark head,
    And twenty looks like thirty.
You sit beside an heiress gay,
    And do your best to win her,
But oh!&mdash;what can one do or say,
    If 'tis a daylight dinner.</p>

<p class="stanza">A lovely dame just forty-one,
    At night a charming creature,
My praise unqualified had won,
    In figure, form and feature.
That <i>she</i> was born, without a doubt,
    Before the days of Jenner,
By sitting next her, I found out,
    Once at a daylight dinner.</p>

<p class="stanza">Freckles, and moles, and holes, and spots,
    The envious sun discloses,
And little bumps, and little dots,
    On chins, and cheeks, and noses.
Last Monday, Kate, when next me placed,
    (A most determined grinner),
Betrayed four teeth of mineral paste,
    Eating a daylight dinner.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">* * * * * *</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

<p>How much farther I indulged in this <i>poetic</i>
strain, or whether I did carry the <i>joke</i> any farther,
I have now quite forgotten, however, I accepted
the invitation, and although I was at the time
perfectly innocent of the scale of dignity and
antiquity claimed by the Tooth-pick Makers'
Company, I felt assured that I should add
something to the store of knowledge which I
had been recently laying in with regard to civic
matters. I must honestly confess that I had no
cause to repent the decision at which I had
arrived.</p>

<p>The day was extremely fine&mdash;the windows of
the rooms opening to the water, the house
smelling of fried fish and mud, and the little
boys with naked legs screaming "please to
make a scramble," we, having attained this
enviable position, in the building which looked
like a race-stand, by threading a labyrinth of
the dirtiest alleys, and stable-yards that ever
pauper or pony inhabited. It was, however, a
joyous scene, and Hull, who was good enough
to be my Mentor on the occasion, pooh poohed

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

the waiters into allowing us to look at the dinner-room 
all laid out for the company; more than a
hundred were expected, partitions had been
pulled down, holes cut out here, and props poked
in there, to afford the required accommodation;
in short, everything gave token of a goodly day.</p>

<p>Hull, who was at home everywhere, and
everywhere popular, appeared, as soon as he
arrived, to supersede everybody else.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said he, "I happen to know
these people&mdash;the Tooth-pick Makers are one
of the most ancient corporations of the city&mdash;my 
dear sir, the Mercers were incorporated in
the 17th of Richard the Second&mdash;I have a tract
that will prove it&mdash;1393 they were embodied&mdash;I 
know the Clerk of the Company at this day&mdash;so 
do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No I do not," said I.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh," said Hull, "don't tell <i>me</i>&mdash;Jemmy 
Hobbs&mdash;everybody knows Jemmy
Hobbs&mdash;married Miss Ball of Blackheath&mdash;splendid 
fellow, Jemmy. Well! these Mercers
are a fine company, so are the Grocers&mdash;St.

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

Anthony is their patron. My dear Sir, I am
forced to know all these things. Then there
are the Drapers, and the Fishmongers&mdash;pooh,
pooh&mdash;Doctors, and Proctors, and Princes of the
Blood, are all fishmongers&mdash;Walworth was a
fishmonger&mdash;eh&mdash;my dear friend, you should
see their paintings&mdash;splendid things&mdash;Spiridiona 
Roma&mdash;fish in all seasons:&mdash;then there
are the Goldsmiths and the Skinners, and
the Merchant Tailors&mdash;Linen Armourers&mdash;eh&mdash;queer 
fellows, some of them, but I do
assure you&mdash;" (this was said in a whisper),
"you will see some men here to-day worth
seeing."</p>

<p>"I suppose" said I, "the Tooth-pick Makers
Company was founded by Curius Dentatus&mdash;whence 
comes the French, <i>cure-dent</i>."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh," said Hull, "no such thing&mdash;much 
older than Curius Dentatus&mdash;I happen to
know&mdash;founded in the reign of Edward the
Fifth, my dear friend."</p>

<p>About this period the company began to
arrive "thicker and faster," and certainly I had

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

never seen any one of them before, which gave,
at least, an air of novelty to the scene&mdash;generally
speaking, they ran fat, and wore white waistcoats, 
such as that, to which I had likened the
bow window of 77, St. James's Street: they
looked all very hot, and puffed a good deal:&mdash;however 
they kept coming and coming, until
the drawing-room, as a sort of thing like a bad
conservatory, well placed to the south-west, was
called, was so full that I began to be as hot as my
companions. Six o'clock arrived, but no dinner&mdash;the 
master of the house&mdash;who, from wearing a
similar sort of uniform waistcoat I took to be a
Tooth-pick Maker, came in and spoke to some
of the fattest persons of the community, evidently
saying that the banquet was ready&mdash;nevertheless 
no move was made, because it appeared
that Mr. Hicks had not arrived.</p>

<p>"You had better," said one of the more
important persons in the room; "let men be
placed ready to see when Mr. Hicks arrives at
the end of the lane by the stables."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the answer, and from that

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

time I heard nothing but Hicks, and Mr. Hicks
talked of, until I was driven by extreme curiosity 
to enquire of my omniscient friend Hull,
who Mr. Hicks was.</p>

<p>"Hicks!" exclaimed Hull&mdash;"why, my dear
friend, you know Mr. Hicks&mdash;the great Mr.
Hicks&mdash;everybody knows Hicks."</p>

<p>"I for one," said I, "do not&mdash;" and it
turned out that at the moment I was not likely
to be enlightened, for, just as Hull was about
to give me an account of this important
personage, a hubbub and bustle near the door,
which speedily pervaded the whole assembly
proclaimed his arrival&mdash;in a moment the buzz of
conversation ceased, a sort of circle was made
round Mr. Hicks, and several of the most
distinguished members of the community
hurried up to take their places near him;
Hull dragged me towards this sanctum, this
magic ring, and with a look of the greatest
importance assured me, that it was right that
I should immediately be presented to Mr. Hicks.
The presentation accordingly, took place, and no

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

sooner was it over, than one of the grandees
came up to me, and in a confidential whisper,
informed me that my place at dinner, was on
the left of Mr. Hicks as being a friend of the
Master;&mdash;I concluded the arrangement was
attributable to Hull, who, I found, was to be
my neighbour on the left, and although I could
have dispensed with the honour of so close an
approximation to the hero of the day, I rejoiced
mightily that I was placed so near my friend
Hull, who would be as useful to me upon such
an occasion, as is a catalogue of the pictures at
an exhibition anywhere else.</p>

<p>In a very short time dinner was announced,
and Mr. Hicks, having the Master on his right
hand, led the way to the large room upstairs,
round the whole of which the table ran, exhibiting,
as I entered the apartment, a lengthened line of
tin covers, looking like a collection of cuirasses,
glittered on the board,&mdash;the heat was tremendous,
and the air redolent of fried flounders. A few
minutes sufficed to arrange us, grace was said
by the chaplain, and we fell to. As in all similar

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

cases, the exercise of eating and drinking superseded 
conversation or remark, and I, who did
but little in that way myself, and having therefore 
an opportunity of seeing the <i>modus operandi</i>,
at my leisure, became suddenly enlightened as to
the extent to which such pleasures may be carried. 
Of each and every dish, did each and every
man partake, from Turtle to White-bait, both
inclusive; my friend Bucklesbury, whom I had
a week before considered a prodigy in the way
of feeding, sank into insignificance by comparison 
with the individuals now before and
around me; to the elaborated course of fish,
succeeded a host of fowls, cutlets, hashes, stews,
and other things of that nature, accompanied by
sundry haunches of venison, and succeeded again
by ducks innumerable and peas immeasurable.
The destruction of all these articles was, however, 
effected with ease in less than an hour and
a half, during which the attentions paid to Mr.
Hicks were the most marked and gratifying;
if the sun shone in upon the tip of his nose, the
waiters were ordered to pull down the blinds

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

before him, if the gentlest breeze wantoned about
the back of his neck, the master of the house
was called to shut the window behind him; for
<i>him</i> the chairman culled the choicest bits; to
<i>him</i> the landlord tendered his most particular
wines: every eye was fixed on <i>his</i> actions,
every ear seemed open to <i>his</i> words; he had
however, as yet spoken little, but had "eaten
the more."</p>

<p>All sublunary pleasures must have an end, so
had this dinner, and a call of silence, and the
thumping of the president's hammer upon the
table, announced that some professional gentlemen 
were about to sing <i>Non nobis Domine</i>&mdash;they 
began&mdash;we all standing up&mdash;I with the
sun full in my eyes, setting over London in all
its glory: the voices harmonized beautifully,
but fine and melodious as they were, I felt that
the canon or whatever it is called, very much
resembled a fire which smouldering and smouldering 
in the low notes, kept perpetually bursting 
out in a fresh place, when one fancied it out:
as far as the religious feeling of the thing goes,

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

it was misplaced, and as for its duration, it
seemed to me more like three graces than one.</p>

<p>This over, the wine began to pass, and
"beards to wag;" Hicks grew condescending,
and the day began to mend; the King's health
was given&mdash;song God save the king&mdash;chorus by
the company, all standing&mdash;The Queen&mdash;The
Prince of Wales&mdash;then the Duke of York, and
the Army&mdash;the Duke of Clarence and the
Navy&mdash;The Memory of Saint Ursula, the
mother of all Tooth-pick Makers, with an
appropriate glee, received with loud cheers.</p>

<p>The Master then rose and begged to propose
a toast&mdash;no sooner had he uttered these words,
than the whole room rang with applause, the
wine-glasses danced hornpipes upon the table to
the music of the forks and spoons, and the noise
was tremendous&mdash;"I see," continued the worthy
President, "that you anticipate my intentions;
gentlemen, there could be no doubt upon your
minds what the toast would be," (more cheering);
"I will not occupy your time, nor hinder you
from the gratification of your feelings upon this

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

topic by dilating upon the merits of the illustrious 
individual whose health I am about to
propose; whether we regard him in public life,
guiding by his zeal and energy the community
which he fosters and protects by his influence, or
view him in private society, the ornament of the
circle of which he is the centre, our gratitude,
and admiration are equally excited. Gentlemen,
I will not trespass upon your time, or wound,
what I know to be the delicacy of his feelings,
by recapitulating the deeds which gild his name,
and which have, during the last year, added so
much to his honour and reputation, and to the
welfare and comfort of his colleagues and associates:&mdash;I 
beg to propose the health of Benjamin
Spooner Hicks, Esq.&mdash;a name dear to every
Englishman&mdash;with all the honours."</p>

<p>Then came a storm of applause unparalleled,
at least in my experience; a band of music
which had hitherto been silent, struck up "See
the Conquering Hero comes," and nine times
nine cheers were given in a style the most
overwhelming. During this storm of rapture, I

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

seized the opportunity of once again asking
Hull who Hicks was, and what he had done, to
deserve and receive all these extraordinary
marks of approbation and applause, but all I
could extract from my rubicund friend was
"pooh, pooh&mdash;don't tell me&mdash;you know Hicks&mdash;my 
dear friend, everybody knows Hicks&mdash;there 
isn't a man better known in the universe."
There was no time amidst the din of glory to
assure him once more that I had by no possible
accident ever heard his name before, so I resumed 
my seat as the object of our enthusiasm
quitted his, to return thanks&mdash;his up-rising was
hailed by the company with an almost Persic
adoration&mdash;silence at length having been obtained, 
he spake&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, and Gentlemen,&mdash;there are certain
periods in our existence which entirely defy
description&mdash;this, as far as I am concerned is
one of them&mdash;I have been placed in many
trying situations, and I think I may say, without
fear of contradiction, I have behaved as became
a man, (loud cheers); I am aware that some of

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

my efforts for the benefit of my fellow-creatures
have been crowned with success (hear, hear,
hear); and I am thankful to Providence that I
am possessed of the means to do good to them as
is not so well off as myself (loud cheers). I say,
Sir, it would be the height of baseness for a
man who has been born with a silver spoon in
his mouth, not now and then to take it out, and
feed them as has not been so fortunate (great
cheering). My political feelings and principles
I need not touch upon (immense cheering);
they are known to all the world (tumultuous
applause); I shall steadily maintain the course
I have heretofore followed, and observe the
straight line, neither swerving to the right
hand, nor to the left, as little awed by the frown
of power, as flattered by its smiles (hear,
hear, hear).</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I sincerely thank you for the
honour you have done me, and beg to drink
all your good healths in return." The shoutings 
here were renewed, but to an extent far
beyond the former exhibition. Mr. Hicks sat

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

down, but still the thunder continued; and
scarcely had it subsided, even for a moment,
when Mr. Hicks, upon his legs again, caused
a relapse which nearly drove me mad.</p>

<p>Hicks waved his hand, and it was a calm&mdash;you 
might have heard a pin drop&mdash;he had to
propose the health of the worshipful chairman
the Master of the Tooth-pick Makers' Company.</p>

<p>After expressing in almost the same words
that Hicks had just before used, his conviction
that this was the "proudest moment of his life,"
the chairman continued to observe, that if anything 
could possibly add to the gratification of
having his health drunk by such an assembly,
it was the fact of its having been proposed by
such an individual. He then proceeded to say,
that he was quite sure in that society, composed
as it was of men of all parties, all professions,
and all politics, he need not expatiate upon
the merits of the honourable gentleman to whom
he had previously alluded&mdash;they were known
all over the world. <i>He</i>, like Hicks, returned
the most heartfelt acknowledgments for the

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

favour he had received at their hands, and sat
down amidst very loud acclamations.</p>

<p>Still I was left in ignorance of all the great
deeds which "gilt" my friend Hicks's "humble
name;" and I found, being so near him, that it
was quite impossible to get enlightenment. At
length, however, I was destined to hear something 
of the character of his achievements; for
shortly after the worshipful Master had sat
down, and just before the healths of the Wardens 
of the Tooth-picks, or some such functionaries,
were about to be toasted, a tall, thin,
pale man&mdash;a rare specimen in the museum&mdash;rose 
and said, as nearly as I can recollect, what
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I am sure you will forgive me for the
intrusion I now venture upon; but I cannot
permit this opportunity to pass, without expressing 
on my own part, and on the behalf of
several of my worthy neighbours, a sense of
our obligation&mdash;and indeed the sense of obligation 
under which, like us, the rest of civilized
Europe are laid by the manly, courageous,

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

zealous, and indefatigable exertions of the honourable 
gentleman on the right of the chair, to
whom you have so justly referred (loud cheers).
It may, perhaps, be thought superfluous in me
to enlarge upon a subject so familiar to your
hearts; but I cannot avoid mentioning a trait
which at once displays the greatness of that
honourable gentleman's mind, the prowess of
his courage, and his immutable determination to
do justice to all men"&mdash;still louder cheers followed 
this point.</p>

<p>"I think," continued the pale man, "I need
not speak more distinctly upon the subject to
which I allude." Here shouts rent the room,
and the glasses began to dance again. "But
lest there should be any gentlemen present,
who might by accident be unacquainted with
the circumstance to which I refer" (cries
of "no, no! impossible! hear, hear! order,
order!")&mdash;"I say, <i>if</i>&mdash;for it may be so&mdash;if such
a thing should be, I think it best at once to
explain that the conduct to which I now specifically 
refer, but which I may truly say is of a

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

piece with every action of his honoured life, is
that which our great benefactor&mdash;and friend&mdash;if 
he will allow me so to call him," (Hicks
nodded, and said "hear!")&mdash;"observed upon
the occasion of removing the lamp from the corner 
of Black Lion Street to the head of Spittle
Court." (Immense cheering.) "Sir, I do not
wish to go into the question of the eleven yards
of pavement from the Swan Inn to the Boot-maker's"&mdash;roars 
of laughter burst from part of
the company, at the evident severity of this
remark upon the conduct of some other eminent
individual, murmurs from others, "hear, hear!"
from many, and "oh, oh!" from a few! "I
strictly confine myself to the lamp; and I do
say without fear of contradiction, that the benefit 
conferred on society by that change, and
the manly way in which it was effected, without
truckling to the higher powers, or compromising
the character and dignity of the Company, has
shed immortal lustre upon the name and fame
of the honourable gentleman to whom I have
alluded. (Immense cheers.) I have to apologize 

<!-- vol 2 page 142 -->

for this effusion"&mdash;("no, no! bravo!")&mdash;"but 
it is involuntary. I have for several months
laboured under emotions of no ordinary nature;
I have now unburdened my mind, and have
done my duty to myself, my honourable friend,
and my country."</p>

<p>The ogre sat down amidst the loudest possible 
applause, and more shouts were sent forth
in honour of Hicks.</p>

<p>The healths of the Wardens of the Company
were then drunk&mdash;<i>they</i> returned thanks:&mdash;then
came alternately songs and glees, by the professional 
gentlemen:&mdash;then they drank Mrs. Hicks
and family;&mdash;and then&mdash;for be it observed, the
fervour of the applause increased as the night
grew older&mdash;the uproar was tremendous&mdash;nine
times nine seemed infinitely too small a complement 
of cheers to compliment the Hicks's,
and I had become dead tired of the whole
affair, when Mr. Hicks&mdash;the great Mr. Hicks,
rose to return thanks for <i>that</i> honour. He
talked of connubial felicity, and spoke of the
peculiar merits and charms of his daughters, with

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

all the eloquence of a tuft-hunting mother.
Having done which, he fell to moralizing upon
the lateness of the hour, and the necessity of
recollecting that Greenwich was nearly five
miles from town; that happy as we were, prudence 
pointed to a period at which such enchantments 
should terminate. "Gentlemen,"
said he, "in conclusion, I have obtained permission 
to propose one parting bumper. I believe 
we are all agreed, that the constitution
of England is a blessing envied by every
country in the world&mdash;(loud cheers). We have
drank the king, the queen, the royal family,
the army, the navy, the ministers, and indeed
everything that we could be well supposed to
drink constitutionally. Gentlemen, the place in
which we are now assembled, suggests to me the
best, the most loyal, the most appropriate, and
the most constitutional toast possible as a conclusion&mdash;I 
give it you with feelings of mingled
loyalty and piety&mdash;I propose to you, 'The Crown
and Sceptre,' and may they never be separated."</p>

<p>This unqualified piece of nonsense delivered

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

seriously by Hicks, (rather overcome), to about
fifty or sixty survivors of the original dinner,
nearly killed me with laughing&mdash;not so the
company&mdash;at it they went&mdash;cheered like mad&mdash;up-standing 
nine times nine&mdash;rattle went the
forks&mdash;jingle and smash went the glasses&mdash;and
in the midst of the uproar, Hicks rose, the
Master did the same, and of course, we followed
the example.</p>

<p>Then came all the worry and confusion about
carriages&mdash;the little alley was crowded with
people seeking for conveyances&mdash;it had just
begun to rain. Hull looked at <i>me</i> and inquired
what vehicle I had?&mdash;I had none&mdash;I was annihilated&mdash;when, 
judge my delight and surprise, at
finding the illustrious Hicks himself at my side,
offering Hull and myself places in his coach.
I could scarcely believe it&mdash;however, so it was,
and an advantage was derivable from it, for which
I was scarcely prepared.</p>

<p>"Come down with <i>me</i>," said Hicks, "directly:&mdash;this 
way&mdash;they are preparing a deputation 
to light me through the alley to the

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

carriage&mdash;I want to avoid it&mdash;my boy tells me
it is all ready&mdash;if we can but get round the
corner, we shall be off without being observed&mdash;
they <i>will</i> do these things, but <i>incog</i>. for me,&mdash;I 
hate state and finery&mdash;eh, Mr. Hull?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" said Hull, "you need no
new honours&mdash;to be sure&mdash;what a day&mdash;eh&mdash;never 
was anything so splendid!"</p>

<p>And so Hicks's boy, or as Hull called him,
"b'y," preceding, we made our escape into
the patriot's carriage; and never did I more
rejoice in my life. The quiet of the calm
which aeronauts experience when they rise in
a few minutes from the tumultuous shoutings
of the populace into the dead stillness of the
vast expanse above, cannot be more surprising
than was the tranquillity of the coach compared
with the boisterousness of the company.</p>

<p>Mr. Hicks carried us as far as he could, without 
inconveniencing himself, and set us down
at the corner of a small street in Cheapside&mdash;having, 
just before we parted, mentioned to me
that if at any time I should be in need of any

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

article in the hardware line, I should find everything 
he had, at wholesale prices and of the very
best quality.</p>

<p>Hull and I walked westward, but whether it
arose from the length of the way or its width,
I cannot exactly state, I was uncommonly tired
when I reached home. When I fell asleep,
which I did as soon as I got into bed, I dreamed
of the extraordinary infatuation which possesses
men in all classes of life to believe themselves
eminently important, and their affairs seriously
interesting to all the rest of the world; and
became perfectly satisfied that every sphere and
circle of society possesses its Hicks, and that
my friend the hardwareman was not one bit a
greater fool than his neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> medicine, I believe,&mdash;for, thanks to a good
constitution, I know less than my neighbours of
the <i>arcana</i>,&mdash;the effects of stimulants are generally 
followed by depression. In love&mdash;as I
then was&mdash;I am quite sure that the system of
forcing the spirits, and exciting the mind, was
one which proved absolute misery to the patient
after the excitement was over; and I candidly
confess that I never felt myself so much "down"
in my life as I was when I got "up" the morning 
after the extraordinary development of vanity
and ignorance, which I have just recorded.</p>

<p>Lifted but to fall from a greater height, I
found myself in a state, I cannot say of desponding, 
but of aching, sickening anxiety, for a
second letter from Daly; but no&mdash;the day passed,

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

and no account of his proceedings arrived.
Hull, who seemed sincerely interested about me,
and really "happened to know" a great deal
more of my affair with Miss Haines than I at
first believed it possible he should have found
out, called upon me and comforted me, and
winked, and tittered, and put his glass to his eye,
and his finger to his nose, and pooh, poohed,
and did all he could to encourage me&mdash;"knew
her father"&mdash;"excellent man"&mdash;"prodigious
property:"&mdash;all of which I received as it was
intended; being at the same time by no means
satisfied with the tone of the information which
I had from my ambassador at Malvern.</p>

<p>My anxiety was, however, not destined to be
relieved until the expiration of five more days,
during which period it had reached such a pitch,
that I felt very much inclined to put myself into
the Worcester mail, and seek an interview with
my negotiator, making the Hop Poles in that
beautiful city my head-quarters. I could not,
however, make up my mind: such a step might
prove something like the heedless shake which

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

a child, for whom its elder sister has nearly
finished a house of cards, gives to the table
whereon it stands, and, by one hasty and incautious 
movement, levels the delicate fabric to its
foundation.</p>

<p>At length, however. Time, in the shape of a
general postman,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"The welcome letter brings:"</p>

</div>

<p>and I, in an agony of contending passion, burst
the seal. I read as follows.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span>. II.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Malvern, Tuesday</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gurney</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Things</span> go on swimmingly. I have become 
universally popular with all the agreeable
people here, and the terror and aversion of the
superannuated patients of our hospital. Emma
is delightful; we sing duets after breakfast&mdash;make 
sketches after luncheon&mdash;and take walks
after dinner. She is fond of backgammon&mdash;we
play together&mdash;she beats me, and laughs: I

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

can beat anybody else; but somehow her dear
little fingers moving amongst the men, and the
piquant air with which she throws the dice, confuse 
me, and I am invariably vanquished. After
tea (which the people here drink with as much
delight and regularity as if they were so many
washerwomen) we dance together; while Major
M'Guffin, who seems very much inclined to
anticipate me in my pretensions to Mrs. Haines,
talks to the not unwilling widow romantically
of the pleasures of domestic life.</p>

<p>We had nearly a serious quarrel three days
since: the Major thought proper to make me his
confidant; and as I was going over to Worcester,
was single-minded enough to beg me to undertake 
a commission for him, which he felt disinclined 
personally to execute. In order to
secure my assistance, he was induced to inform
me that, having a desire to look as well and as
youthful as possible, he had resolved to thicken
his hair (which has grown extremely thin), by
the application of some celebrated vegetable
balsam, which, according to the published accounts 

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

of it, would produce a luxuriant crop
of curls in the course of three applications.
"Now," says the Major, "if I go myself with
my half-bare pate, the folks in the shop will
know that I want the balm, or the balsam, or
whatever they call it, for myself, d'ye see, and
that I would not in the least like; but <i>you</i>,
with your scrubbing-brush head, never could
be suspected of wanting any such aid&mdash;will <i>you</i>
buy me a bottle?"</p>

<p>I need not tell you how readily I undertook
the affair; but little did he guess the real
cause of my assiduity upon the occasion. Off I
go to Worcester, buy the bottle of miraculous
balsam at one shop, and a bottle of strong
depilatory, for the instant annihilation of superfluous 
hair, at another. Into the Poles I go;
out with the corks; and having carefully decanted 
the depilatory into the balsam bottle, seal
it up with the most delicate nicety, and return
to my anxious friend.</p>

<p>The Major, grateful beyond measure, cons
over, with the greatest attention, the directions

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

for using the much longed-for balm; and, according 
to the instructions specified, saturates his
small crop of hair with the liquor, and ties on
his night-cap as tightly as possible, and goes to
bed, anxious for the morning, when, like a male
Medusa, he might put his head out of the window, 
and exhibit to his sincere friend and messenger 
the beautiful result of his experiment.</p>

<p>I knew what must inevitably happen; but
even yet scarcely prepared for the entire success 
of my scheme&mdash;I was up early&mdash;it is a
fashion here to rise soon. I was leaning over
the rails in front of the house; M'Guffin's bedroom 
window was open; but although I saw him
not, I thought I heard the thunder of his oaths
occasionally rolling about the ceiling of his
room; himself still invisible. At length one
of the servants came to me, and told me that
Major M'Guffin wished to see me up-stairs: he
was very unwell, and could not come down to
breakfast. I obeyed the summons; and, upon
entering the apartment, beheld him in his
dressing-gown, sitting before a looking-glass,

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

his head as clean, and as clear of hair as a nine-pound 
shot.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Major?" said I.</p>

<p>"Matter," said the Major; "by the powers
I'm a ruined man; Samson's case was nothing
to mine; look at my head."</p>

<p>I did, and did not laugh; on the contrary, I
exclaimed, in a tone of horror, "Mercy on us,
what have you done with your hair?"</p>

<p>"Hair is it," cried the Major; "here&mdash;look&mdash;see;" 
saying which, he exhibited to my view
his night-cap, the interior of which, containing
the whole stock of the article which once had
decorated his head, looked exactly like an ill-built 
bird's-nest. So fatally well had the depilatory 
done its work, that when in the morning
he anxiously removed the cap, away came every
vestige of its crinitory covering, and the patient
was left in the deplorable state in which I found
him.</p>

<p>It would evidently have been vain to attempt
to pun him into calmness at the loss of his
"hair apparent," or cajole him into a good temper 

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

by alluding to "the hare and many friends,"
or by speaking of "trifles light as <i>h</i>air;" I saw
he required as much management as if the
operation had been prudentially performed by
way of preface to a more serious course of restraint. 
I therefore expressed grief and surprise
at the extraordinary effect produced by the application: 
but my horror was indescribably great
when the gallant officer expressed his irrevocable 
resolution of immediately putting to death
the innocent perfumer of Worcester, who had
sold me the article. This expedition, of course,
I felt it absolutely necessary to stifle in its birth,
and therefore painted in my best style, without
giving offence, the ludicrous appearance he would
make in Worcester, and the certainty that the
wags at the Wells would get hold of the story,
and make him uncomfortable, if not ridiculous,
by disseminating it in all directions. I advised
him, on the contrary, to allow me to send off for
an experienced hair-dresser, who would, in the
course of four or five hours, come down with an
assortment of wigs, from which he might make

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

a suitable selection in time for dinner; overruling 
his objections to the sudden display which
his new acquisition would make, by remarking,
that if the balsam, for which he had sent the
preceding day, had adequately fulfilled his expectations, 
founded upon the pretensions it put
forth, he would have been equally surprising in
appearance to the eyes of the company.</p>

<p>It seems I had luckily hit upon the true scheme
of management. The nervous sensibility of the
Major to any thing like ridicule, got the better
of his latent feeling of revenge; and I accordingly 
dispatched one of Steers's men for the
perruquier, promising faithfully to keep his
secret from our fellow-lodgers, and more especially 
from Mrs. Haines and Emma.</p>

<p>We are to have a little <i>f&ecirc;te</i> on Thursday; it
is Emma's birth-day&mdash;I am to be master of the
ceremonies. We shall have donkey races, and
other rural sports, and fire-works in the evening: 
the Great Malvern band&mdash;banditti&mdash;are to
be in attendance, and we purpose being uncommonly 
gay: indeed, Emma does me the honour

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

to say, that I have worked a glorious revolution
in this once dull place. I chiefly effected it by
rebelling against the megrims of sundry invalids, 
who, as I told you in my last, set up their
ill health as a plea against our good spirits.
Now I had no idea of sick people governing a
whole house, and accordingly very soon put them
down; and now, poor dears, they have betaken
themselves to a parlour on the opposite side of
the hall, leaving the long room free for our
gambols and gaiety.</p>

<p>I am forced to stop short in the description
of our proceedings, for Mrs. Haines tells me
Emma is waiting for a walk; so for to-day,
adieu. Every thing looks well; and I have
little doubt that another week will establish me
in the confidence of mother and daughter, and
our great <i>coup</i> may be made; so keep up your
spirits, assure yourself that every thing here
looks <i>couleur de rose</i>, and that our eventual
triumph is secure. We talk of going to Ross
for a day or two&mdash;<i>nous verrons;</i> telling you <i>that</i>,
puts me in mind of repeating a slight accidental 

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

joke, which occurred here the evening
before last. I was talking to a vastly pretty
little woman, whose face is "a fortune" (but
which always reminds me of the fox-found
vizor in the fable), of the refinement which
has taken place in conversation and manners
since those days in which, we are told, wit and
humour so much more abundantly flourished.
My pretty doll assented to all my grave remarks
upon the interesting topic, and concluded by
quoting to me that oft-repeated couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Immodest words admit of no defence;
For want of decency is want of sense."</p>

</div>

<p>I&mdash;anxious to let her know that the lines were
not, as they are very generally thought to be,
Pope's&mdash;said, "Oh, I see you have been looking 
at Roscommon."&mdash;"Not I," said the dear
innocent. "We went last week to Ross churchyard, 
to admire the view, but we had not time
to go upon the Common." Only imagine
such exquisite naturalness, or, as our friend
the poet would call it, such "viridity of intellect;" 

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

such incomparable innocence. But I
must have done; so remember, in three days
you shall hear again, and in the mean time,
once more say I, keep up your spirits.</p>

<p class="right">Yours always,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. F. Daly</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>I read this letter with a degree of pleasure
and anxiety, which few can appreciate; and till
I came to the end of it, I can scarcely say which
of the two predominated. But when I arrived
at its conclusion, and found it one continued
history of Daly's own proceedings, his own
happiness, and, as it appeared to me, his own
flirtations and successes therein, I honestly
admit, that anxiety most incontestibly triumphed.
It appeared to me that the minister had forgotten 
the monarch, and that he was acting
independently, not with the mother, as he had
first proposed, but with Emma. And then I
began to reprove myself&mdash;knowing his extraordinary 
qualities, as I did&mdash;with having been
prevailed upon to send such a man upon such a

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

mission. I did not then quite as well know, as
I have learned since, how madly fond women
are of any thing very odd, and very notorious.
When Lunardi first exhibited to the English
public the sight of a gentleman, tied in a basket,
under a silk bag, carried up into the clouds by
means of hydrogen gas, he became the idol of the
women; they wore Lunardi hats, and Lunardi
bonnets, and balloon petticoats, and parachute
caps; and even went the length of cutting strips
from his coat, as relics, and making a point
of touching him as he paraded for that and
such-like purposes in the Pantheon in Oxford
Street. Now, although Daly had never practised 
Icarusism, and had confined his efforts to
mother earth, his reputation had soared&mdash;he
was known, talked of, praised by some, abused
by others, and laughed at by many; but still he
was talked of. This unquestionable claim to
female attention and favour he possessed to a
considerable extent; and being what is conventionally 
termed "a privileged person" (the precise 
meaning of which I do not pretend exactly

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

to understand), his life&mdash;as indeed I have already
recorded&mdash;was one continued series of incidents,
best calculated to maintain&mdash;what, I admit, <i>I</i>
should have considered&mdash;a most unenviable distinction 
from his fellow men.</p>

<p>It certainly appeared&mdash;from whatever cause it
might arise&mdash;that he had assumed the character
of hero of <i>my</i> romance in his own person: that
there was any thing like acting "in the name and
on the behalf" of his friend, I could not, from
any part of his communication, discover; and I
felt very much inclined to address him upon the
subject, and endeavour, by gently pulling the
check-string, to remind him that there <i>was</i> such
a person as Gilbert Gurney in the world: a circumstance 
which, it seemed to me, had entirely
slipped his memory. But then we had previously
agreed that I was not to write to him during his
disinterested siege of Miss Haines, lest the
appearance of a letter from me (the superscription 
to which, in such a community as a watering-place, 
would, in all probability, be seen by more
than the one person to whom it was directed)

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

should mar his man&oelig;uvres, and blow up the
scheme altogether. This circumstance, and the
apprehensions connected with it, of course prevented 
me from taking the only step which
could satisfactorily relieve the doubts, which the
style of my friend's letter, I confess, began to
excite in no very inconsiderable degree.</p>

<p>A few days, however, served to throw a new
light upon the affair, and leave me in the full
blaze of conviction of his skill and adroitness,
his insincerity and his treachery; for before the
expiration of another fortnight, during which he
had reported to me a conversation which he had
had with Miss Haines, of which, he told me, I
formed the leading subject, Hull, my omniscient
Hull, called upon me for the second time, his
eyes sparkling with the consciousness of "happening 
to know" something, yet conveying an
expression not altogether free from concern and
regret. It is impossible to describe the April-like 
character of his countenance, as he sat himself 
down opposite to me at my breakfast table.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what news have you got?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

<p>"News, my dear friend," replied Hull, "<i>I</i>
have <i>no</i> news; you have plenty&mdash;eh&mdash;."</p>

<p>I looked a negative.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh, don't tell me," continued my
companion; "can't hoax me; you know well
enough&mdash;so do I."</p>

<p>"I know nothing, I assure you," said I;
"nor can I even guess to what you allude."</p>

<p>"Allude!" exclaimed Hull, with a sort of
crow; "why, my dear Sir, it's known every
where&mdash;all over London. Jem Burrows knows
it&mdash;so does his wife. Come, come, you are
joking&mdash;it won't do&mdash;if <i>you</i> are sorry for it,
so am <i>I</i>&mdash;I don't believe you care twopence
about it."</p>

<p>"About what?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest?" said Hull. "I hate
to be laughed at&mdash;eh&mdash;you don't mean to say
that you have not heard&mdash;about your friend
Daly?"</p>

<p>"I heard <i>from</i> him a few days since," said I.</p>

<p>"Where was he then?" said Hull.</p>

<p>"At Malvern," was my reply.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

<p>"You won't hear from him at Malvern again,"
said Hull&mdash;"left that Monday last."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" said I.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;my dear Sir," said Hull: "I happen
to know it; spoke to a man yesterday who passed
him on the road between Cheltenham and Oxford."</p>

<p>"On Monday," said I; "surely I should
have either seen or heard from him if that
were so."</p>

<p>"No, you won't either hear or see from him
in a hurry," said Hull, looking diabolically
cunning.</p>

<p>"I'll go forthwith to his lodgings, and obtain
information from Redmond."</p>

<p>"Redmond isn't there," said Hull; "he is
with his master."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" said I.</p>

<p>"I called at his lodgings before I came here,"
said Hull.</p>

<p>"At his lodgings!" said I; "why, you
told me you were not in the habit of visiting
him."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

<p>"Quite right," said Hull: "but I happen to
know his landlady, Mrs. Widdlecum; have known
her these two-and-thirty years. Pooh, pooh, my
dear Sir, you can't deceive me; knew her when
her husband kept the Caxton's Head, in Bearbinder 
Lane, before you were born. I had
heard of Daly's movements, so I called upon
her to inquire; and I found Redmond, Daly's
servant, gone, and the lodgings given up&mdash;now
do you smell a rat?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I, "that Daly has got into
some infernal scrape, and has been forced to
bolt."</p>

<p>"Scrape!" exclaimed Hull; "now be serious; 
you don't mean to say that you are ignorant
of the truth?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say," replied I, "that I know
nothing whatever of his movements during the
last ten days."</p>

<p>"Then you have been very ill used," said
Hull&mdash;"my dear Sir, he is married."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it," said I: "cunning dog&mdash;and 
he has really carried his point, and without 

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

ever letting me know it. And pray, as you
know every thing, where is Emma?"</p>

<p>"Where?" said Hull; "where should she be
but with <i>him?</i> But, my dear friend, what do
you mean by carrying his point?"</p>

<p>"It was part of our scheme," said I&mdash;"only 
don't betray me&mdash;that he should take
this step with regard to one of the ladies,
in order to leave me the quiet possessor of the
other."</p>

<p>"What other?" said Hull.</p>

<p>"Emma," said I.</p>

<p>"Emma!" echoed Hull; "my dear Sir, you
don't even yet comprehend me&mdash;Daly has eloped
from Malvern with Miss Haines&mdash;Emma&mdash;eh&mdash;pooh 
pooh."</p>

<p>"With Emma!" said I&mdash;incredulous in the
highest degree&mdash;"no, no, Mr. Hull; you know
a great many things, but here, for once, you
<i>are</i> mistaken."</p>

<p>"Mistaken!" said Hull;&mdash;"my dear Sir,
you'll see a long account of it in the Chronicle
to-morrow."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

<p>"May be so," said I; "and a strong contradiction 
of it the day after."</p>

<p>"I'll stake my head on the truth of it," said
Hull: "Billy Bowles knows Daly as well as
<i>you</i> do&mdash;he told me the fact&mdash;saw him with Miss
Haines, on Monday, galloping in a chaise and
four, from the inn at Northleach, towards Oxford."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," said I&mdash;and at the moment 
I said so, my thoughts flew to the tone
and character of Daly's last letter. In the
next minute I began to fancy it might be so&mdash;thence 
my ideas rushed to the consequences of
such perfidy, and I began to cast about in my
mind where I should find a fit person to act as
friend, and call the traitor to account.&mdash;"It
cannot be," said I.</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> so," said Hull. "My dear Sir, it
is never worth my while to state what I don't
happen to know to be fact: rely upon it, you
have been ill-used."</p>

<p>"And depend upon it, Mr. Hull," said I, "if
I have, I will have satisfaction for such conduct."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

<p>"Satisfaction," said Hull; "pooh, pooh&mdash;what 
satisfaction is there in shooting at a man
who is shooting at you at the same time; who
is irrevocably united to <i>your</i> sweetheart:&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;take 
my advice&mdash;treat the affair with philosophy 
and contempt."</p>

<p>"You must permit me," said I, "to be the
best judge in this case; no man can appreciate
another's feelings under such circumstances, and
therefore no man can direct or guide his conduct: 
baseness like Mr. Daly's must not go
unpunished."</p>

<p>"His conduct is not to be defended, that's
certain," said Hull.</p>

<p>"And where," said I, "is it supposed&mdash;admitting 
the rumour to be well founded&mdash;that
the happy couple are gone?"</p>

<p>"Northward," said Hull; "across from Oxford. 
She is under age, as I happen to know."</p>

<p>"But now really," said I, feeling as if I were
in a dream, or but that moment awakened from
one, "is this true? is it possible that a man can
have behaved in such a manner?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

<p>"You'll find it true enough," said Hull;
"and there is one great consolation in the affair&mdash;a 
girl so easily won is not worth having&mdash;that's
<i>my</i> maxim&mdash;has been through life&mdash;that's the
reason I have never married."</p>

<p>"Fickle, fickle Emma," said I.</p>

<p>"Rely upon it," continued Hull, "Daly will
give you some good reasons for his conduct, and
convince you in the end, that he has done you
a service, instead of an injury."</p>

<p>"Well," said I&mdash;and the sensation of stupefaction, 
which the intelligence had caused, made
me appear perfectly calm and collected&mdash;"we
shall see."</p>

<p>I saw that my kind-hearted companion, Hull,
was greatly pleased with the placidity of my
manner, and perfectly satisfied with the notion
that the thing would go no further. He did not
seem to be aware of the different external effects
produced by the working of our passions; and,
when he left me, little calculated that the first
step I was about to take, was to proceed to
Knightsbridge barracks, in order to secure the

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

good offices of a most agreeable friend, who held
a lieutenant's commission in one of the regiments
of Life Guards, who in those days, and before
they had proved their prowess and gallantry in
the field of glory, were wont to campaign in
Hyde Park, or at Wormwood Scrubs, dressed
in cocked hats, jack-boots, and long pig-tails&mdash;as 
witness the facetious parodist, who, in 1812,
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"God bless their pig-tails, <i>though they're now cut off</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>Which savours a little of the spirit of the celebrated 
distich on the Scotch roads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Had you but seen these roads <i>before they were made</i>,
You'd lift up your hands, and bless <span class="smcap">Marshal Wade</span>."</p>

</div>

<p><i>N'importe;</i> so it was: and to the gallant lieutenant 
with the tail, I imparted the history of the
injury I had received at the hands of my pseudo
friend. I still confidently hoped that the story
was groundless; but, supposing it to be true, I
rejoiced to find that the gallant officer perfectly
coincided in my view of the course to be adopted; 
and agreed with me, that nothing short of

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

shooting my friend, and making his enamoured
and devoted bride a disconsolate widow on the
spot, ought to satisfy my injured feelings. Nothing 
could be more acceptable to me than
the readiness with which he offered his assistance, 
in the arrangement of the result, consequent 
upon his advice, in order to bring the
affair to a conclusion the moment we heard
of Daly's arrival within our reach. We became
mutually interested in each other; and having
passed the forenoon with him, we partook together 
of an early dinner in his room, which was
on the highest floor of the building, and commanded 
an agreeable view of Hyde Park.</p>

<p>The following morning terminated all my
doubts as to the fact. I read in the Chronicle a
clear and distinct account of the elopement from
Malvern, and the steps taken by Mrs. Haines to
pursue and recover her fugitive daughter. I
was satisfied. And it is not unworthy of remark,
to those who doubt the moral influence of the
public press, that although Hull had himself
foretold the appearance of this detail in the

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

newspaper, and had evidently written it himself,
I did not hesitate to admit its truth the moment
I saw it in print, although I was seriously
sceptical when the man himself told me the
fact, which he subsequently communicated to
the journal.</p>

<p>If, however, any lurking doubts could yet remain, 
the following letter, dated from Stockport,
put an end to all of them. It was a sort of
prose duet from Emma and Daly united. In
those punning days of my life, I could not doubt
which of the performers had taken the <i>base</i> part.
It formed No. 5. of our correspondence, and
I therefore subjoin it.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Gurney</span>,</p>

<p>For I hope you will still allow me so
to call and consider you&mdash;your surprise at the
receipt of this letter I can easily imagine;
as well can I conceive your anger and resentment 
at what, without explanation, must
appear to you my treacherous and insidious
conduct. It is not improbable that intelligence 

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

of the step we have taken may have
reached you through the public papers, before
this can come to your hands: whether it be
so, or not, the fact is, I am married&mdash;and if
that were all, I might stop, and entreat you to
receive me and my bride with sufficient kindness
to outweigh the anger of her mother; but as
the individual to whom I am united for life, is
one in whom you have taken a deep and tender
interest, it becomes necessary that I should
farther explain myself before we meet.</p>

<p>I am married to Emma Haines&mdash;you now
have the truth&mdash;and I really think, when you
become acquainted with all the circumstances of
the case you will neither embitter our prospects
of happiness by continuing hostile to the match,
nor permit either of us to suffer in your good
opinion in consequence of what we have done.</p>

<p>Were I alone to describe to you the particulars 
of the affair or to attempt to depict the
motives and feelings by which Emma has been
actuated, you might imagine that I was endeavouring 
to palliate a breach of confidence at

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

the expense of sincerity and even truth. She
therefore finishes this letter, and I conclude
here, by earnestly entreating you to see the
matter in its true light, and accept the olive
branch which your amiable and sincere friend
holds out.</p>

<br/>

<p>So far went Daly&mdash;then comes his better
half.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Gurney</span>,</p>

<p>My husband has read me what he
has written to you upon the subject of our
marriage, leaving it to me to give an account
of my feelings towards you, and a justification
of conduct, which, while it doubtlessly appears
to <i>your</i> view, almost unjustifiable, involves <i>him</i>,
for whom I have the warmest affection and the
sincerest regard in circumstances of delicacy
and difficulty.</p>

<p>The truth, however, will I trust, exonerate
us both from any imputation of insincerity.
When first we had the pleasure of making your

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

acquaintance, I will not deny that I was highly
pleased with your manners, talents, and accomplishments, 
and the hours I passed in your
society were reckoned by me amongst the
pleasantest of the day. I am not in the habit
of concealing my feelings or disguising the
gratification I feel in the enjoyment of conversation 
with clever and agreeable people; but I
felt it necessary in my later interviews with you
to put a restraint upon myself, and even affect a
coolness which does not naturally belong to me,
because I saw too plainly that you began to
misconstrue my friendship into some tenderer
feeling. Gratified as I was in your society, I
lived in perpetual apprehension that under a
mistaken notion of the character of my sentiments 
towards you, you would make a declaration 
and an offer, which, according to the common
rules of the world, would necessarily terminate
our acquaintance. What I dreaded, actually
came to pass, and you were excluded from our
house. In order to render the affair less remarkable 
to our acquaintance, who might have

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

been inquisitive as to the cause of your sudden
disappearance, my mother, at my suggestion,
removed to Tenby, nor will I deny that a
change of scene was rendered more agreeable
to me from the altered circumstances of our
domestic circle.</p>

<p>From the time we left Brighton to the
present moment, I never heard of you, never
imagined that I occupied the smallest share of
your care or attention; and I therefore became
happy in the belief that whatever prepossession
you might have entertained in my favour had
been overcome, and that in a year or two our
friendship might possibly be resumed upon its
original footing, a circumstance to which I assure
you I looked forward with pleasure, and which
even now I anticipate.</p>

<p>It was therefore without the slightest feeling
of injustice towards you, of whom I never for
one moment thought except as a friend, that I
received the attentions of Mr. Daly; in the
natural openness of my disposition I did not
attempt to conceal the feeling he had excited,

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

and here it is that I must give him the praise
which he justly merits at your hands. In a
conversation induced by our constant association, 
and in which I did not affect to disguise
my sentiments towards him, he confessed himself 
your friend, and advocate for my favour&mdash;explained 
to me the cause of his backwardness
in reciprocating an affection which he could not
but have perceived, and it was not until I had
most solemnly assured him, not only that I
never would unite myself with you, but that I
had never entertained the most distant intention
of doing so, that he confessed himself, and proposed 
the only step by which <i>my</i> happiness, and
I hope <i>his</i>, could possibly be secured; for much
as I could have wished to avoid the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of an
elopement, my mother's determination to make
me the wife of a venerable Peer, now staying
at Malvern, drove us to the expedient of trying
to obtain her forgiveness upon the principle of
"what is done cannot be undone."</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I do trust to your
goodness of heart and kindness of feeling, as

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

well as to the memory of our past friendship,
to meet and receive us as we most desire upon
our return to London, to which place we are
proceeding by easy stages, so as to be there on
Thursday next. Assure yourself of my continued 
esteem, as you may of that of Mr. Daly's,
who is, as I am, and always hope to be,</p>

<p class="right">Yours most truly and sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Emma Daly</span>.</p>

<p>In witness of my approval of all this, I hereunto 
set my hand,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. F. Daly</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>I read this joint effusion twice over attentively. 
It certainly altered the character of
Daly's conduct towards me, and changed that
of Emma's apparent frivolity, and fickleness&mdash;yet 
I found but little consolation in it, for their
joint palliation was based upon my own
vanity, and Emma's original indifference; and
yet, thought I, if girls will talk with their
eyes, it must require a greater knowledge of
the art, than I possess, to distinguish between

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

the animated sparkle of simple friendship, and
the devoted gaze of love; for if I misread the
expression of Emma's looks at Brighton, I must
have been anything but an adept. True it is I
never had spoken on the subject, and true it is
that when I opened my heart to Daly, his
opinion of my want of energy was pretty
strongly expressed. Here however I was, enlightened 
upon the point, and left to lament, as
I thought, the loss of an object which, if it had
not been seized upon by another would never
have been mine.</p>

<p>My gallant friend in the jack-boots, cocked
hat, and pig-tail, to whom I of course communicated 
the letter, was of a very different
opinion: he declared his belief to be that
Emma <i>had</i> entertained an affection for me, of a
more tender and warmer character than mere
friendship; that she had been induced by her
new husband to make the disavowal, in order to
shield him from the consequences; and that, in
point of fact, the stratagem which, with his
usual ability, he had contrived, of <i>her</i> writing

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

part of <i>his</i> letter, added to the baseness of his
conduct, because it considerably increased his
meanness.</p>

<p>"The affair," said Lieutenant O' Brady, "is
in my keeping, Mr. Gurney&mdash;that man is a
poltroon&mdash;he hides himself behind his lady's fan&mdash;we 
must have him out the moment he
arrives."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said I.</p>

<p>"Think so!" replied the Lieutenant,&mdash;"by
the powers, Sir, if <i>you</i> don't think so too, we
must make the matter personal between ourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, "I am in your hands&mdash;you
alone are to regulate my proceedings."</p>

<p>"Right, Gurney, right," replied O'Brady,
"and by the powers, right shall be done you,
that you may rely upon&mdash;I hate this fellow for
making his wife come forward&mdash;och&mdash;won't we
settle that affair&mdash;send him home hopping."</p>

<p>"Anything you please," said I, feeling, I confess, 
a doubt, whether under the circumstances
Daly was so very much to blame&mdash;however,

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

honour is everything, and if my Irish friend
considered it right that I should lame or maim my
English friend, because he had run away with a
girl&mdash;or, as it almost appeared to me, permitted
himself to be run away with&mdash;who openly
declared that she neither did, would, nor could,
feel any affection for <i>me</i>, of course I could not
object, and therefore begged him to do me
the favour to wait upon Daly as soon as possible
after his arrival in town.</p>

<p>I never saw a man so ready to oblige another
in the whole course of my life&mdash;his activity was
quite edifying; nevertheless, I admit, that the
necessary delay of two or three days, was
particularly irksome to me. The constant consideration 
of the subject&mdash;not a particularly
pleasant one&mdash;combined with the natural tendency 
of my mind to justify and even forgive
the offender, kept me in a new state of excitement; 
and if truth were to be told, I do
think that my readiness to be reconciled to Daly,
was not altogether disconnected from the lurking 
affection for Mrs. Fletcher Green. The

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

proceedings of Daly and Emma, whatever their
genuine character might be, had the entire
effect of leaving me free to perfect <i>that</i> alliance,
and since the avowal of Miss Haines's indifference, 
it was surprising to find how very much
my feelings of admiration for <i>her</i> had diminished
in their force. However, I had the affair of
honour to settle, and Daly, who was a crack
shot, might perhaps do me the favour of providing 
for me in another way.</p>

<p>On the third morning after the receipt of the
partnership letter, to which of course I returned
no answer, nor should I have done so, even had
I been able to despatch it so as to catch the
travellers, I beheld in the announcement of
fashionable arrivals at Thomas's Hotel, Berkeley
Square, "Mr. and Mrs. Daly, from the North."
The lynx-eyed champion of my fame and respectability 
had seen it even before I had, and
by twelve o'clock my active friend Lieutenant
O'Brady was at my lodgings.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, breathless with haste and
delight, "it's all settled&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

<p>"What?" said I.</p>

<p>"That little matter between you and Mr.
Daly," said the Lieutenant, "I have seen him,
spoken to him&mdash;a deuced nice clever fellow he
seems to be&mdash;so&mdash;we have arranged it all&mdash;the
thing is done and over."</p>

<p>"I am extremely glad to hear it," said I,
convinced that a little explanation and discussion 
had smoothed all difficulties, and terminated
the affair.</p>

<p>"I thought you would," said the Lieutenant;
"it's a bore to have this sort of thing upon one's
mind longer than necessary&mdash;I have fixed the
meeting for four o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Meeting!" said I.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said O'Brady, "what did you
expect I meant?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," replied I; "where is it to be?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you as we go," said the Lieutenant,
who seemed by his cautious mode of giving me
the information, to imagine that I might be
tempted just to drop in at Marlborough Street
police-office on the way.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

<p>"He behaved quite like a gentleman, that I
<i>must</i> say," said O'Brady; "referred me to a
friend who happened to be with him&mdash;said he
expected as much&mdash;inquired if you had received
his letter&mdash;I answered in the affirmative&mdash;so he
walked out of the room, and leaving the Major,
as he called him, to settle preliminaries, we
have concluded the same, and I will call for you
at three."</p>

<p>"But now," said I, "under all the circumstances, 
what is it I am to do?&mdash;I mean to say,
what am I to require?"</p>

<p>"Require," said the Lieutenant, "you have
nothing to do but to fire at him, till you have
hit him, or he hits you, or until his friend and I
agree that the thing has gone far enough."</p>

<p>"Because," said I, really wishing to know
the end of the meeting, "he cannot make an
apology for running away with a young lady
upon whom I have no claim, and who has
declared her affection for him, and her indifference 
towards me."</p>

<p>"What in the world has that to do with it?"

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

said O'Brady,&mdash;"you trusted him&mdash;he betrayed
you&mdash;why didn't he write, and let you into his
affairs."</p>

<p>"Because he would have betrayed his plan,"
said I, "and exposed himself to detection by
her mother, or at all events put himself at my
mercy."</p>

<p>"Och! that's it," said O'Brady "all that
might be mighty well for <i>his</i> friend to advance&mdash;you 
have nothing to do with that&mdash;the plain
fact is this, you have put yourself into my hands&mdash;I 
have called the man out, and he is coming;
and if you thought any thing like what you talk,
you ought never to have come to me at all."</p>

<p>"But, my dear O'Brady," said I, "when I
came to you I had heard only the report, I had
not received the joint explanation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Explanation!" said O'Brady, "the explanation 
only makes the matter worse; the thing
cannot be altered now&mdash;it is all too late; if he
is right, and you think so, you need not try to
hit him, only I would just advise you not to
throw away a chance, because you may rely

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

upon it, as he has, in my opinion injured, he is
not in the least likely to spare, you."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly empowered to take me
where you please," said I; "my conduct, when
I am out, will be regulated by my feelings."</p>

<p>"I'll trust to you," said O'Brady, "and so
I will be here at three, with the doctor of our
regiment, in case of accidents; and if you
have a spare pocket handkerchief or two, you
can just while away the time till we come, by
scraping them up into lint:" saying which, my
gallant friend departed, with one of his liveliest
"<i>au revoirs</i>," leaving me to the enjoyment of
my own thoughts, and the interesting employment 
of lint-scraping, for my own benefit.</p>

<p>I certainly felt no disinclination to the coming
affair on the score of physical apprehension; but
I do candidly admit, that the tone and spirit of
O'Brady's reasoning upon the matter, led me to
consider the principle upon which such things
are usually conducted, and their frequent occurrence 
upon occasions when, it must be clear,
they are perfectly unnecessary. Because, under

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

a certain impression, I had suggested to my
gallant friend my belief that I had been betrayed
and injured by Daly, now that I was satisfied
that Emma had thrown me over&mdash;(as dinners are
dressed at suburban taverns "on the shortest
notice,") and that Daly really was not in fault, I
could not be permitted to change my line of
proceeding with my opinion of his demerits.
Of course I had now no alternative, and accordingly 
I waited the arrival of my excellent second
and the regimental surgeon; resolving in my
own mind, as far as <i>my</i> share of the rencontre
was concerned, that he should not be called into
service.</p>

<p>Three o'clock at length arrived; and, punctual 
to the moment, so did my friends. O'Brady
stepped out of the coach, in which he and the
surgeon drove up to the door, and summoned
me. I obeyed his call, and in a few minutes we
were on our way towards Hampstead.</p>

<p>"Where are we to meet?" said I.</p>

<p>"Under the lee of Primrose Hill," said
O'Brady;&mdash;"a sporting spot. The Major and

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

I had fixed Wimbledon Common; but as the
Old Bailey Sessions are now on, I thought it
might be more convenient to fight in Middlesex."</p>

<p>The word Old Bailey Sessions brought to my
mind all the scenes I had so recently witnessed
there, and the peril to which my antagonist,
if he killed me, might be exposed upon the
zig-zag system of trial. The inviting words,
"hang at eight and breakfast at nine," rang
in my ears; however, having made up my
mind, not to fire <i>at</i> Daly, I consoled myself
with the certainty, that if I escaped the bullet,
the halter was altogether out of the question.</p>

<p>We proceeded up the hill of Camden Town,
and having arrived at the lane leading to Chalk
Farm, the coach stopped, and we alighted, I
being, I confess, a little surprised at seeing no
weapons wherewith we were to contend: however, 
O'Brady, who had evidently been there
before, whispered something to the Doctor, to
which he appeared to assent, and the coachman
was directed to stop&mdash;I concluded, for the purpose 

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

of removing my corpse to my lodgings, if
I was killed; or my yet living body, if I were
only severely wounded.</p>

<p>"Come on," said O'Brady, "don't let us be
last on the ground."</p>

<p>"Where are the pistols?" said I.</p>

<p>"Och, put your heart at ease about that,"
said O'Brady; "my man Sullivan is under the
hedge long before this; and has got the Mantons
and the doctor's instrument-case, in a carpet
bag. Sully may be trusted in such matters;
mayn't he, doctor?"</p>

<p>"He may indeed," said the military Esculapius, 
who appeared to me to be just as much
pleased as his companion with the deadly-lively
adventure in which we were embarked.</p>

<p>"There they are," said O'Brady, pointing to
two persons at a considerable distance, who were
approaching us in a direction nearly opposite to
that by which we had reached the neighbourhood; 
and sure enough there I saw Daly&mdash;the
admirable Daly&mdash;once my friend, and, perhaps,
not even now my enemy&mdash;accompanied by a

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

tall, gaunt personage, whose name I inquired
of the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"That," said O'Brady, "is Major M'Guffin."</p>

<p>"M'Guffin!" said I; and the history of the
depilatory and the night-cap flashed into my
mind; and, more than that, flashed into my
mind the conviction that Daly had succeeded
in rivetting his fetters with the widow; and by
inducing him to undertake the part which, in
the earlier stage of the proceeding, he had proposed 
himself to play, secured the augmentation
of the gentle Emma's fortune.</p>

<p>My feelings were considerably excited as we
approached the hostile pair; it was impossible
for me to forget the happy and agreeable hours
which I had spent in Daly's company, nor entirely 
to obliterate from my recollection the
caution of my poor mother, with regard to my
associates; for here&mdash;as if she had possessed
the gift of prophesying&mdash;was I, after a sort of
scape-grace acquaintance with the maddest wag
of London, destined, perhaps, to terminate my

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

existence prematurely, in consequence of his
misconduct. My first impulse was to walk up
to the rogue, and offer him my hand; but, to do
O'Brady justice, his anxiety to keep up the
quarrel as it stood, never relaxed. He desired
me to stop where I was, while he went forward
to speak to the Major. I obeyed, and entered
into a conversation with the surgeon as to the
healthiness of Hampstead, keeping my eye,
however, on the watch for Daly, who seemed to
me to be strongly imbued with feelings greatly
assimilating to my own. However, <i>his</i> Major
and <i>my</i> Lieutenant were the gentlemen to be
satisfied; and as it appeared this could not
happen unless the principals fought, I suppose
he, as I had already done, bowed to the necessity 
of asserting his courage, as I had felt it
imperative to vindicate my honour; and so it
was that two lives were jeopardized.</p>

<p>Major M'Guffin having said a few words. Lieutenant 
O'Brady cried, "Halloo;" and out of a
ditch sprang his trusty squire, Jem Sullivan, with
the carpet bag, which contained the weapons;

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

and no sooner did the surgeon behold this
man&oelig;uvre, than he turned to the group, and
secured his case of instruments; and having re-delivered 
them to the man, with some particular
instructions to be careful of them, walked away
to a distance, and never turned his face round
till the event had come off, lest in case of any
accident, he should be subp&oelig;naed as a witness.</p>

<p>Our worthy friends now proceeded to load the
pistols, during which process I did not in the
least know how to act with regard to Daly: the
time, however, was short, and the Lieutenant
having concluded his part of the business,
walked up to me, and desired me to stand
where he placed me: he then stepped out six
paces; at the end of which. Major M'Guffin
stepped out six more: at the end of which he
placed Daly, to whom he gave one of his pistols;
as the Lieutenant handed me one of his.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Major M'Guffin, "we
have agreed that you are to fire together, by
signal one, two, three:&mdash;raise and present at the
one, two; and fire at the three."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

<p>"Now," said Daly, "just one word: we are
met here to answer the call of Mr. Gurney; no
opportunity has been afforded me of explaining
to him circumstances which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Lieutenant O'Brady, "I have no
doubt you mean extremely well; but we are here
to fight, Sir, and not to talk."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "Lieutenant O'Brady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gurney," said the Lieutenant, "you
are not in a position to speak: we are not to be
trifled with, Sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Daly, "no more are
<i>we;</i> therefore to business, and the sooner the
better."</p>

<p>"Are you ready, gentlemen?" said the Major.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"One, two&mdash;&mdash;" and before the gallant officer
could get any farther, my pistol, which had the
hair trigger set, went off; and the ball having
grazed the calf of my leg, and ripped up the side
of my pantaloons, lodged in the ground immediately 
at my foot. I was never more mortified
in my life&mdash;the thing was so awkward&mdash;not to

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

speak of a stinging sort of feeling, which the
scraping off of the flesh inflicted.</p>

<p>"That comes of hair-triggers," said Daly,
coolly.</p>

<p>"Why don't you fire, Mr. Daly?" said the
Major.</p>

<p>"I?" said Daly.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the Major; "the other
gentleman has had <i>his</i> shot."</p>

<p>"Faith it <i>is</i> so," said the Lieutenant; "go
on, Sir; go on."</p>

<p>"Not I, by Jove," said Daly, "unless Mr.
Gurney takes his other pistol, and fires at me."</p>

<p>"He can do no such thing," said both the
gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Daly, "if I <i>am</i> to
fire, I suppose I may choose my own direction:"
saying which, he raised his pistol perpendicularly, 
and fired in the air.</p>

<p>"The devil, Sir!" said his Major, "what are
you about?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to affront my friend, Sir?"
said my Lieutenant.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

<p>"Not I, by heaven," said Daly; "no more
than I ever meant to injure him. You had
better, in the first instance, call your surgeon,
and see that he is not more hurt than you fancy.
I came here at his call, and will stay here as long
as he likes; but I will not take advantage of an
accident."</p>

<p>"Mighty handsome," said the Lieutenant;
"that I <i>must</i> say; but we want no doctor yet;
so let us proceed; and now mind, Mr. Gurney,
mind and be more careful the next time."</p>

<p>What might have happened had the combat
continued, it is impossible to say; it was destined 
to terminate without any other bloodshed
than that which, by my <i>gaucherie</i>, I had caused;
for scarcely had the words "next time" escaped
the lips of the gallant Lieutenant, before five or
six men, three or four boys, and two or three
constables, bounced over a stile, which gave, or
rather hindered, entrance to the field. Two of
the fellows rushed at <i>me</i>, and seized me by the
collar. The doctor took to his heels in the
direction of his instrument case; and Daly, who

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

was a dab at every thing, took a hedge and
ditch with a run, like that of a Leicestershire
hunter, equal to sixteen stone. Major M'Guffin, 
in an endeavour to follow his leader, stuck
in a hawthorn bush; but was eventually lugged
out by his principal, who, taking advantage of
the peculiar care and attention with which the
Bow Street patrols&mdash;as they turned out to be&mdash;favoured 
me and the Lieutenant, was "over
the hills and far away" before any of the heavy-heeled 
Christians could touch him. Of me they
were secure; for although my self-inflicted wound
was "neither as deep as a well, nor as wide as
a church door," it prevented my following the
example of the gallant fugitives, whose departure, 
I honestly confess, was one of the most
agreeable sights I ever saw, convinced, as I was,
that Daly had no more desire to hit <i>me</i>, than I
had to touch <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The sequel was unpleasant&mdash;the Philistines
would by no means let us go; and the consequence 
was, that although the gallant Galen
declared he would not be answerable for what

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

might happen if I were suddenly transported to
the police office to enter into sureties to keep
the peace, they unmercifully bundled me and my
gallant second into our own hackney-coach,
which had been, at their suggestion, brought up
the lane. The indignation of my fiery friend,
O'Brady, at this interference of the law with
our arrangement, was beyond description great;
but whatever this interruption might have cost
him, it was nothing compared with his fury
when one of the myrmidons insisted upon keeping 
his pistols. I never saw a man in such a
rage in my life: however, as I anticipated, I had
sufficient influence at Bow Street, the smouldering 
remnant of my early acquaintance with the
chief magistrate, to get the matter arranged
much to his satisfaction. I entered into the
required recognizances; and by the intervention
of Mr. Stafford, the chief clerk, who seemed to
me to manage the whole business of the office,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Ride on the whirlwind, and direct the storm,"</p>

</div>

<p>obtained the restoration of O'Brady's "barking

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

irons," as he called them; to the peculiarly delicate
touch of whose <i>double detente</i> I was specially indebted 
for a wound in my leg, which, although by
no means serious, was not by any means agreeable.
When the whole of the business was over, I
sincerely regretted the interruption which had
taken place, because I felt convinced, by Daly's
manner, that he had plenty of matter of justification 
to adduce for what had occurred; and
because, although irritated, and even enraged,
at what, upon the first blush of the affair, appeared 
to be his flagrant misconduct, I saw by
his manner, and by his gallant, yet considerate
bearing towards me, under our very peculiar
circumstances, that I should have received explanation 
sufficient to establish and confirm his
exculpation from misbehaviour towards me in
the character of rival; as it was, no such explanation 
could take place, we were parted much
as we met: indeed the only consolation O'Brady
seemed to experience, even under the dread of
losing his pistols, was derived from the fact that
the sureties were only for twelve months, and

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

the certainty that upon the three hundredth and
sixty-sixth day from the date thereof, I might
have him out again, and shoot at him to my
heart's content.</p>

<p>I had no such wish&mdash;no such intention&mdash;no
such thought; and the first step I took upon my
return to my lodgings, was to send and inquire
whether Daly had succeeded in escaping the
fangs of the police. I was glad to hear he had;
but I honestly admit, I felt sorry to find that he
and Mrs. Daly had, almost immediately after
his return home, and, as I believe, without her
being at all aware of the cause of his temporary
absence, taken their departure for the West of
England. I ascertained the reality, too, of what
I had only suspected&mdash;the reconciliation of the
family party had been produced; and the anger,
which seemed to have been of the "<i>brevis ira</i>"
school, soothed by the intended union of Mrs.
Haines with the Major, which was to take place
in the course of the ensuing week: so that, in
fact, Daly had carried every point for himself,
which he had suggested as worthy of my attention. 

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

But what then? Emma had preferred
him to me: she denied ever having cared for me
beyond that sort of friendly feeling, which must
sometimes exist between men and women;
and most certainly, if she ever did entertain
any softer or warmer feeling, her sudden abandonment 
of that attachment, made it quite clear
that I had made no great impression on her
heart, and had sustained no great loss on the
transfer of her affections.</p>

<p>The sudden departure of the Dalys put an
end to any further explanation between us; and
circumstances, which subsequently occurred, rendered 
them entirely unnecessary, as the sequel
will show. That they or I should quit London
just at this period, was what I wished&mdash;all I
lamented was, that I had not an opportunity of
showing my magnanimity, as well as the sense I
entertained of his honourable conduct, in not
taking advantage of my inexperience with regard
to hair triggers. As for O'Brady, his chief
anxiety about my wound&mdash;which was in fact
scarcely worth talking of&mdash;seemed to arise from

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

the hope that, at the twelvemonth's end, when I
had Daly out again, I should be more cautious.
Before those twelve months expired, my poor
friend, O'Brady, was himself shot dead, in consequence 
of a quarrel about play.</p>

<p>My course, however, now seemed clear&mdash;what
the tendency of my feelings was, may be
guessed at by the fact, that being able, on the
third day after the duel, to walk nearly as well
as ever, I proceeded to the neighbourhood of
Park Lane, to inquire whether Mrs. Fletcher
Green had returned to town: the answer was,
she was expected that evening at home to dinner, 
and was going to the last opera of the
season that night. In addition to every other
feeling with regard to the lady, I was piqued
into an attempt to gain her hand at this crisis,
inasmuch as, besides ensuring my lasting happiness 
by my success, its achievement would
practically relieve me from the imputation of
willow-wearing, and vindicate my character as a
lady-killer. I therefore secretly rejoiced in the
information, and took my measures accordingly.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> I had never yet had an opportunity 
of making any distinct declaration of
my sentiments to the amiable widow, I yet
flattered myself that I had rendered her sensible 
of the preference she had excited by a
thousand little nameless assiduities, and that
sort of watchful devotion which women not
only readily understand, but very particularly
approve of. I began seriously to revolve in
my mind the words which Daly had formerly 
whispered in my ear, and although
I never had in my whole composition, as I
hope and believe, one grain of mercenary
feeling, still I do admit that the fact of

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

Mrs. Fletcher Green's having so large a sum as
one hundred thousand pounds at her own disposal 
was not calculated to check the affection
which her beauty, accomplishments, and above
all, her agreeable conversation, had inspired;
and with a consciousness that, had she been
pennyless, I should have been equally captivated, 
however prudence might in that case
have checked a declaration of my sentiments, I
resolved, now that I was entirely at liberty,
to cultivate with ardour and assiduity the good
understanding which I flattered myself existed
between us, and lay myself out for an invitation
to her house, which upon several occasions,
under feelings of a different character, I had
previously refused.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre, however trifling its object
may appear to some people, was one which
required a certain degree of courage as well as
skill; the consciousness that a man has a point
to gain, always more or less unnerves him; and
many a time in my life, when I have been
invited to join a party in which there has been

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

some one individual with whom I would have
given the world to pass the day, the very fear of
doing that, which I most longed to do, has induced 
me refuse; lest my anxiety to accept the
bidding might betray me, perhaps to <i>her</i> in
whom I felt so deep an interest, or to those who,
in the character of "lookers on," might have
seen more of the game than the players.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher Green, however, was a widow,
and that <i>does</i> make a difference&mdash;it would be
all idleness to go on shillying-shallying with <i>her</i>&mdash;this 
reflection strengthened me in my purpose, 
and accordingly, acting on the intelligence 
I had received, I went that night to the
Opera. Her box, now become familiar to my
eye, was on the pit tier, and therefore attackable 
in its front&mdash;a most fortunate circumstance
for me, as after my continued shyness and
repeated refusals of invitations, I did not feel
my acquaintance with its owner sufficiently
matured to justify my calling to the box-keeper
to open "Mrs. Fletcher Green's box" in the
ordinary manner, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the lobby. Accordingly

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

I planted myself directly in front of the well-known</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Shady blest retreat"</p>

</div>

<p>almost as soon as the premier <i>coup d'archet</i> had
hushed the anxious amateurs into silence.</p>

<p>The overture ended&mdash;the curtain rose&mdash;no
Mrs. Fletcher Green. A group of wretched
creatures began the opera, in the garb of priests,
with grey beards, and green wreaths on their
heads, led by two more distinguished rarities,
who interchanged alternately the softest and
most martial sentiments of love and glory in
the jingle of recitative. The scene ended by
the history of the murder of a Prince and nine
illustrious scions of his royal house, quavered
forth by a very disagreeable lady to a "popular
air" with variations. "Ah," said I, getting quite
impatient with the absence of the widow, "how
truly has the Italian Opera been likened to the
pillory, where those who are nailed by the ears
expose their heads!"</p>

<p>The storm of sorrow and its accompaniments
ended, I again turned and looked into the box&mdash;still 

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

was the casket without the jewel&mdash;I began
to grow more and more uneasy&mdash;I nodded to
three or four friends who were near me, but I
thought not of them&mdash;I felt that nervous sinking
of heart which no man who has not been in a
similar situation can duly appreciate&mdash;the heroes
with their tin helmets and leathern armour, their
painted cheeks, corked whiskers, and chalked
necks, sickened me to death&mdash;I began to hate
everything near me and round me&mdash;when,
sweeter to me than all the harmony of the stage,
I suddenly heard the running rattle of the rings
upon the rods, and turning instinctively to the
sound, I beheld in the very act of drawing back
the curtain destined to screen her from the too
ardent gaze of the world in general, the charming
Mrs. Fletcher Green!</p>

<p>I caught away my eyes, and affected not to
have seen her. I thought of the owl and the
sun&mdash;I believe I trembled&mdash;the top of my head
was so near her hand that I almost fancied it
touched me. What should I do&mdash;turn again
and boldly face her&mdash;or should I wait a little

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

and affect to be surprised at my proximity?&mdash;why 
should I? Dear soul! true, most true it
is, that she was everything that could be amiable, 
delicate, charming, and accomplished&mdash;yet,
after all, she <i>was</i> but a woman; and would she
be <i>so</i> angry if she really <i>did</i> find out that I had
come there before the overture began, to secure
that particular spot in order to be near her?</p>

<p>I asked myself that question, and I answered
it thus&mdash;"I do not think she will;&mdash;at all events,
if she be, it will terminate my pursuit of her&mdash;better 
be nipped in the bud," thought I, "than
linger." However, I was still young, and it
required a considerable exertion to put my look
in execution&mdash;I drew a long breath, and fired
my glance.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the beautiful expression
of her animated countenance, when with&mdash;what 
I now believe to have been a feigned&mdash;surprise, 
she exclaimed, "Is that <i>you</i>, Mr.
Gurney?" extending at the same moment that
hand which, as I now began to think, would
some day be entirely my own. I felt confused

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

and delighted&mdash;indeed, I am almost ashamed to
own all that I did feel, for I am sure I must have
appeared exceedingly silly to her searching and
experienced eye; but if the condescension which
she had in the first instance evinced, somewhat
unsteadied me, what did I experience when she
leant her face over the front of the box, and
asked me "whether I had not better come round
to them?" By Jove, I felt her breath upon
my cheek&mdash;her sister was with her&mdash;I could
not answer, but I looked my happiness, and in
less than three minutes, having, with the courage 
of a lion, called the "box-keeper" to open
the door, found myself seated close beside <i>her</i>,
whom of all women breathing I now the most
admired.</p>

<p>"I am so delighted," said she, "to have
found you here. I have sent after you a
hundred times, but you have changed your
house, and I did not know where in the world
to send a note to beg of you to come to me
this evening after the Opera. I have a few
people coming&mdash;all pleasant too&mdash;I can't endure

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

bores&mdash;and I was saying to Catherine&mdash;my
sister&mdash;I believe, Mr. Gurney, you know my
sister?"</p>

<p>We both bowed.</p>

<p>"I was saying to Catherine, I would give
the world to know how we could get hold of
you."</p>

<p>"You are too kind," said I, "and I too fortunate."</p>

<p>"We have heard of all your exploits," said
the girl:&mdash;"Why you are a perfect knight-errant
in these degenerate days."</p>

<p>I wished the exploit at old scratch, and
dreaded lest the description might turn upon
the cause of my meeting with Daly. I made
a sort of acknowledgment for the compliment,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"I think, Catherine," continued my most
agreeable friend, "we had better keep him, now
we <i>have</i> got him; there's plenty of room in the
carriage, and we will undertake to carry you off
with us."</p>

<p>I was of course beyond measure happy; and

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

although my felicity was occasionally interrupted
by visits of sundry very fine gentlemen, of the
class since called dandies, of different ages and
sizes, who, as I had seen upon former occasions,
dropped in and bowed out of the box during the
evening, upon the whole I was very well satisfied
with the state of affairs.</p>

<p>The opera and ballet over, Mrs. Fletcher
Green commissioned me to get up her carriage.
I obeyed, scarcely knowing what I was doing,
and in due course of time found myself with
Mrs. Fletcher Green on one arm, and my intended 
sister-in-law, Miss Catherine Carter, on
the other.</p>

<p>How different were my sensations then, to
those which I endured, when restrained by the
sense of another engagement, and I believe
by my own shyness, from joining the same
people in the same place so short a time
before.</p>

<p>Two such charming creatures I never yet had
fallen in with, and whatever impressions had
been made upon me while seeing her only like

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

a bright star in other spheres, it was heightened
into perfect ecstasy when I saw Mrs. Fletcher
Green "at home."</p>

<p>Her house, to which we rapidly drove, at
whose door I had often been, but whose threshold
I had never yet crossed&mdash;often since have I
passed it, full of recollections&mdash;was near Hyde
Park. A suite of charming rooms, charmingly
fitted up, received us; there were flowers, and
drawings, and books, and lutes, and flutes, piano-fortes, 
harps, guitars, a little fat spaniel, and a
large parrot, and boxes, and bags, and ottomans,
and sofas, and low chairs, and long chairs, and
easy chairs; and in the middle stood a table
affectedly covered with a table-cloth, on which
were tea-cups, and tea-pots, and fruits, and
wines, and fowls, and all sorts of things; for
the demolition of which some of the party had
already arrived.</p>

<p>"Is not mine a dear nice comfortable home?"
said Mrs. Fletcher Green, taking my hand
kindly and hospitably; "now we have shown
you the way here&mdash;I shall say no more&mdash;people

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

I am fond of, are sure to find me delighted to
see them."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Catherine, who was as fresh
and as wild as a mountain roe, with thick curling 
hair, and eyes like a gazelle, "I'm sure
you'll like us when you know us better; there
<i>is</i> such a thing as sympathy in the world, and
<i>we</i> like <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Fascinating creatures!" thought I.</p>

<p>The room began to fill with the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of
Mrs. Fletcher Green's friends who were still
in town;&mdash;peers, poets, painters, a quondam
cabinet minister or two (I believe a bishop,
but to <i>that</i>, at this distance of time, I will
not swear), and some odiously interesting foreigners, 
who were so exceedingly free and
easy in their addresses to my admirable widow,
that they kept me in a perpetual <i>feveret</i>,
formed the group, adorned and sanctified by
the presence of some lovely women, whose
names I need not mention; beautiful mothers
with lovely daughters; young wives without
their husbands; young husbands without their

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

wives; in short, it was all fascination, and when
a few glasses of sillery, <i>bien frapp&eacute;</i>&mdash;the night
was <i>so</i> hot&mdash;had overcome the diffidence I felt
at my sudden augmentation of acquaintance, I
became gay and happy. How could I be otherwise? 
Mrs. Fletcher Green had placed me
next her, and I found my conversation grow
extremely effective, until I could see, by the
expressions of various countenances, that I was
becoming rather popular; a conclusion to which
I was most specially drawn by the fact that an
old lady,&mdash;the only speck upon the scene,&mdash;who
had never moved a muscle of her face, since
her arrival, nor opened her mouth except to
put some grapes into it, at the end of one of
my observations upon things in general, which
created a laugh, lifted her glass to her eye and
looked towards me. This proved that I was at
least worth looking at; nevertheless, it was clear,
that she did not like what she saw, for she
dropped the glass she had in her hand after a momentary 
glance, and betook herself to another,
and more congenial glass which stood beside her.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

<p>Catherine went to the piano-forte, a Lady
Caroline somebody followed her, and a quiet,
gentlemanly man, who, like the old lady, had as
yet said nothing, followed Lady Caroline. I
could not make out why my charming widow
had asked him. I now found out he was good
for singing; and these three sang&mdash;and nothing
was more popular in those times&mdash;Moore's "O
Lady fair." Moore, too, was present himself,
and his eyes sparkled with pleasure as the beautiful 
harmony swelled upon his ear; and he presently 
exhibited his gratitude by singing for the
first time he ever sang it, I believe, to others,
"Love's young dream." I had never heard
him before. I never heard anything so beautiful. 
Without much voice, he expressed the
feelings and sentiments he had himself embodied,
with a tenderness and sweetness as indescribable
now, as they were then incomparable.</p>

<p>And so wore on the night, until the night at
last was quite worn out. Mrs. Fletcher Green
had been more delightful than ever: she talked
of love,&mdash;aye, of widows' love, too,&mdash;in reference, 
as she professed, to a very beautiful

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

widow who was present; but, inexperienced as
I was at that period, I could not but comprehend 
the true bearing of my fair friend's hypotheses;&mdash;indeed, 
she did not seem very anxious
to conceal her real meaning; and when eventually 
the joyous party broke up, her last words
were, "Remember, Mr. Gurney, what I said
about the widow;&mdash;faint heart never won fair
lady."</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning when I left her
door. London stood bright and smokeless; the
streets which, in the noon of day, crowded with
passengers, look long and foggy, now cleared of
the countless living objects which then throng
them, seemed shortened to the sight. There
was a freshness in the air as the breeze blew
on my face, which was burning, and I felt my
young heart beat with satisfaction at the recollection 
of the occurrences of the last few hours.
It was evident that the widow, if I chose it, was
my own. I admit that her gaiety of manner, and
liveliness of conversation were not observable,
particularly with regard to myself: she was gay,
and lively, and kind, and agreeable to all; yet

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

she selected <i>me</i> to be next her,&mdash;she talked, too,
to <i>me</i> of love,&mdash;spoke of the happiness of married
life,&mdash;expressed her belief that the beautiful
widow to whom I have just alluded would
marry again. Now all this, considering she
was a beautiful widow herself, seemed something 
to build my hopes upon.</p>

<p>Seven thousand pounds per annum in money
and estates was what Daly said she had brought
her husband. There were no children left.
That sum must, as I fancied, of course, still
be her own: with seven thousand a-year in
addition to my own four hundred and ninety,
I could do something.&mdash;As the joke goes of
the naval lieutenant at Portsmouth, it was clear
that if I had been bred to the law, the law
would never have been bread to me, and as I
stood in the world, it seemed as if this was a
most critical period of my life.</p>

<p>I had lost Emma Haines&mdash;if, as I had previously 
argued, it may be called a loss&mdash;not to
possess what one never had gained. Here were
no contingencies&mdash;no mother's frowns&mdash;no guardian's 

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

suggestions&mdash;no&mdash;the thing was all her
own.</p>

<p>I would not have married an Empress but
for herself; yet as I before argued, the woman 
is delightful,&mdash;she would be delightful
if she were pennyless;&mdash;the fortune does not
deteriorate from her attractions,&mdash;a gold frame
sets off a good picture, although it only exposes
the faults of a bad one. I'll have her.</p>

<p>I recollect saying these words&mdash;aye, as well
as if it were but yesterday&mdash;just as I was
crossing Bond-street, from Bruton-street to
Conduit-street. "Faint heart never won fair
lady." So <i>she</i> said; and so <i>I</i> say,&mdash;No clever
woman ever says anything without meaning
something. "The iron is hot, I'll strike,&mdash;the
sun shines, I'll make my hay,&mdash;to-morrow shall
decide the question."</p>

<p>And so it did, as shall be forthwith shown.</p>

<p>After a restless prostration of body for some
hours, I rose feverish, and certainly not refreshed, 
to breakfast. I had not slept; for who
can sleep when the heart and mind are so

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

actively engaged in anticipations such as those
in which I now indulged? I breakfasted,&mdash;that 
is, I ate some tasteless toast, and drank
some equally tasteless tea: everything of this
world, worldly, was secondary to the one great
object in my view. Nevertheless, I went to
church&mdash;St. George's, Hanover-square&mdash;and I
believe I was as devout as my neighbours; for,
strange as it may seem, I think (at least I did
<i>then</i>), perhaps uncharitably, that one half of the
best bred congregations go to church to look at
the other half; and that, while the lips are mechanically 
repeating the responses, the eyes are
travelling strangely to the right and to the left.
If it be not so even now, how can we account
for the accuracy with which the devout church-goer 
comes home to luncheon full of the minutest 
particulars of the dress, position, and conduct 
of the rest of the "gathered together?"
And yet, such is the advantage of external
show, and such the value of appearances, that
being only a regular church-goer gives the hypocritical 
sinner a tenfold advantage in society

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

over the infinitely more innocent individual,
who is not so constant in his attendance on
divine service, but whose heart is perhaps more
often communing with his God.</p>

<p>Upon the occasion to which I refer, I remember 
perfectly well that I was most particularly 
attentive. I felt that I was about to incur
a heavy responsibility, and all that I can charge
myself with in the way of irregularity of proceeding 
was, as I take it, much to my credit.
When the psalms were given out I did not
catch the number, and not wishing to seem less
versed in what was going on than my neighbours, 
I opened my prayer-book, not where other
people had opened theirs, but at the service of
matrimony, which, upon that particular day,
appeared seriously interesting to me;&mdash;I say
seriously, for I honestly confess the obligations
therein imposed, appear to me to be of a much
more important and solemn character than the
generality of people who plight their faith at
the altar seem to consider them.</p>

<p>The sermon was&mdash;at least I thought so&mdash;a 

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

very long one,&mdash;the matter not attractive,&mdash;the 
manner of the preacher even less so;
and I admit that, when he concluded, I felt
more pleased than I ought to have felt, and that
my pleasure was not of that particular character
which it ought to have been at the conclusion of
such an appeal.</p>

<p>I was again in the street,&mdash;again my thoughts
reverted to the great enterprise of the day.
"To be, or not to be," that <i>was</i> the question.
Sunday too,&mdash;the better day the better deed.
I felt an impulse.&mdash;As the Quakers say, "the
spirit moved me." Such a woman might be
snapped up; opportunities like this did not
occur every hour. It was decided&mdash;and accordingly 
I slackened my pace, in order to give her
time to compose herself after her return from
church, and to catch her, before people dropped
in, as seemed to be the custom of her house, to
luncheon.</p>

<p>I was embarked on a new venture&mdash;trying
a new style of address&mdash;I had certainly been
lucky in some other cases; and although, in

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

that of Miss Haines, I had laboured under a
mistake, as she said, or she had inconsiderately
admitted a preference, which she had afterwards 
felt it prudent or agreeable to disclaim,
still even <i>she</i> was not the only being to whom
I had been devoted.</p>

<p>In my first and earliest love-affair, although
as in the last, I was not entirely successful, inasmuch 
as circumstances prevented my reaping
the happiness which I might have enjoyed under
a more favourable conjuncture&mdash;I had won a
heart&mdash;a young, a gentle, timid, beating heart,
which, perhaps, had never throbbed before I
set it in motion&mdash;in my own opinion it never
throbbed afterwards in the same way&mdash;but here
I was to make my advances upon a clever,
experienced, worldly woman, whose younger
sister seemed very much to resemble in character 
and description the amiable girl who first
possessed my affections; and I wavered a little
even on the edge of my coming declaration, as
to whether I should adopt the younger and
discard the elder lady. The consciousness that

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

the latter had exhibited infinitely more kindness 
and consideration towards me than the
former, decided me. Yet, still I lingered about
the streets, cold, nervous, sick&mdash;if she refused
me, I should, as Emma very wisely had said
about <i>me</i> upon the late occasion, be shut out
of her agreeable society&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;friendship 
might still be left for us. I could almost
hear my heart beat as I turned up Brook-street
in my way to her house&mdash;but then "faint
heart never won fair lady"&mdash;and so, it <i>was</i> to
be; and so I knocked as boldly as I could at
the door&mdash;it was opened&mdash;Mrs. Fletcher Green
was at home&mdash;and in five minutes I was in
the dear boudoir, with the adorable creature
herself&mdash;but Catherine was there too: and beside 
her, a guardsman, whose name I forget,
and a Count something, whose name ended
in Sko, or Sky, as Counts' names very often
do.</p>

<p>It was now evident to me that Miss Carter
must be a fortune as well as her sister, for the
Count was unremitting in his attentions to her;

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

the Captain rather devoted himself to our
hostess; but again she exhibited her preference
for me, and again made me sit next her during
luncheon, which was protracted, by agreeable
conversation, until nearly four o'clock. I
began now to be anxious for my opportunity&mdash;I 
began, moreover, to fear that it would not
offer, but at last the assiduous Count made a
move, and promising to meet the ladies afterwards 
in the park, retired.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gurney," said Mrs. Fletcher Green,
"if you have nothing better to do, dine here
to-day&mdash;we shall not be more than half-a-dozen."</p>

<p>"Do," said Catherine.</p>

<p>What could I say?</p>

<p>"Will <i>you</i>, Captain Lark?"</p>

<p>"Too happy," said the gallant Captain.</p>

<p>"If you mean to ride, Catherine," said Mrs.
Fletcher Green, "it is time to get ready.
It takes her at least an hour to prepare herself
for horseback."</p>

<p>"Ten minutes, you mean," said Catherine;

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

"however, I will go, and leave you to the
beaux."</p>

<p>"I must run away," said the Captain.</p>

<p>I wish you would, thought I.</p>

<p>"Well then, I shall leave my sister to the
special care and protection of Mr. Gurney,"
said Catherine.</p>

<p>"You are too obliging, Kate," said Mrs.
Fletcher Green, with a look which convinced
me that, although she meant her observation to
sound ironical, she really felt herself very much
obliged to her for retiring.</p>

<p>"Adieu till dinner-time," said the Captain,
and away went he, in company with the fascinating 
Kate; she to dress, and he to ride.</p>

<p>The period had now arrived&mdash;the moment
to which I had so long looked forward was at
hand. Mrs. Fletcher Green seemed to me to
be instantaneously aware of my awkwardness;
she seated herself on a sofa, and made a sort of
sign which I could not but construe into an
invitation to sit beside her; there was a lurking 
devil in her eye&mdash;I saw that she already

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

anticipated the course I was about to pursue&mdash;I 
felt conscious that I had betrayed myself&mdash;but
I could not immediately begin a conversation
likely to lead directly to <i>the</i> point&mdash;a momentary 
silence therefore ensued&mdash;she saved me
a world of trouble, and relieved me from all
my embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "did you dream of the
beautiful widow last night?"</p>

<p>"I should not like to confess my dreams,"
said I;&mdash;"at all events to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"What! do you think I should turn evidence 
against you, and show you up to Lady
Harriet?" said my fair companion.</p>

<p>"I certainly did not dream of <i>her</i>," said I.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, then," replied Mrs. Fletcher
Green, "that you are not very susceptible&mdash;she 
is lovely&mdash;and I could tell you something
that might please you; to be sure it might spoil
you, for men's heads are very easily turned."</p>

<p>"I admit that," said I, "but I do not exactly
think your house the most favourable sphere
for Lady Harriet's display."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

<p>"Why!" exclaimed she, "what has my poor
dear darling house done to merit your disapprobation?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said I. "But when <i>you</i> are in
it, it seems almost as presumptuous, as I am
sure it is unwise, for pretenders to admiration
to come within its circle."</p>

<p>"What!" said my fair friend, "do you really
think <i>me</i> so very agreeable? Upon my word,
you do me the greatest possible honour; but I
am not blind&mdash;you cannot compare me with
Lady Harriet&mdash;she is younger than I am&mdash;and,
as for person, she is lovely."</p>

<p>"Granted," said I; "but where is the intellect 
to illuminate those regularly formed features 
of hers&mdash;where is the mind to animate the
eyes&mdash;where the intellect to captivate&mdash;where,
in short, are all those charms&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Which I," interrupted Mrs. Fletcher Green,
"possess in such abundance."</p>

<p>"You have saved me the trouble of finishing
my sentence," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh! you must know," said Mrs. Fletcher

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

Green, "that I am quite aware of all my own
perfections. It would be the height of affectation 
in me not to feel and to know, that I am
tolerable enough&mdash;that I am good-natured,
high-spirited, and love fun to my heart: but it
would be the extreme of folly in <i>me</i> to suppose
that I resembled Lady Harriet in any of those
attractions which place her in the first rank of
our leading beauties."</p>

<p>"Undeceive yourself," said I, warming with
my subject, "there is not a human being on
the face of the earth, who could for a moment
hesitate in a decision on that point."</p>

<p>"How agreeable," said Mrs. Fletcher Green,
"it would be if a woman could but bring herself 
to believe all the pretty things men say
to her. I dare say, the moment you leave
this house, you will go to some of your
friends, whom I don't know, and show up
me and Kate for two mad women, full of
flightiness and folly, and, in the ordinary course
of worldly proceedings, turn up your hands
and eyes, and wonder how two silly creatures

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

at our time of life can make such fools of
ourselves."</p>

<p>"You do me the greatest injustice," said I.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," said my fair hostess; "but
I do not do the world generally injustice. I
tell you mirth and laughing are my delight&mdash;I 
get together all the pleasant people I can&mdash;I 
make my house agreeable&mdash;I select those
who like to meet each other&mdash;I never permit
any serious discussion or grave debate. What
you saw last night is a fair specimen of our
living; and yet I am quite aware that this,
which is innocence itself, and has only the
demerit of being a little unlike the ordinary
run of humdrum society, gives vast umbrage
to some of the ultra stiff prudes and sages,
who, when they see other people happy, shake
their old empty heads and croak out&mdash;'Ah,
something bad will come of it!' "</p>

<p>"Do not, pray, class me amongst the empty
headed," said I. "You have opened Elysium
to me, and I am but too happy; although, perhaps, 
that very happiness may lead to misery."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

<p>"There," exclaimed Mrs. Green, "that's
it. You are like the odious frumps I have
just been talking of&mdash;'something bad will
come of it.' "</p>

<p>"Not bad," said I, hesitatingly, "but to <i>me</i>,
perhaps, much wretchedness."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Gurney," said Mrs. Fletcher
Green, "what can you mean&mdash;wretchedness to
<i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes; to be shown a gleam of such happiness, 
only to be excluded from it eternally."</p>

<p>"Why," said the lady, "who is going to
exclude you?&mdash;you are as welcome as flowers
in May. Kate and I have made up our minds
to be extremely fond of you; and we have
resolved to make you one of our most obedient
and faithful knights."</p>

<p>"There <i>are</i> circumstances," said I "which
qualify the brightest pleasures&mdash;a dread of something&mdash;an 
apprehension&mdash;I feel myself unable
to explain my meaning&mdash;I dare not&mdash;but&mdash;you
will forgive me&mdash;your manner to me has been
so kind&mdash;perhaps, too kind&mdash;that my whole

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

heart and soul are enchained by the fascinations
which surround me&mdash;conscious, too, I am of
my own demerits&mdash;I dare not venture to say
all I feel."</p>

<p>Here I was overcome by my feelings, which
were ardent and sincere. I looked at my
Amelia&mdash;I thought of her at that moment by
her Christian name&mdash;there was an indescribable 
softness and sweetness in the expression
of her countenance&mdash;no frown&mdash;no pride&mdash;no
resentment&mdash;it was a look&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"More in sorrow than in anger."</p>

</div>

<p>"Good heavens, Mr. Gurney!" said she;
"what can you mean? I have too high an
opinion of you to suppose that you mean either
to insult or laugh at me. Your conduct is a
most cutting satire upon my behaviour to you.
You are like the rest of the world, or, at all
events, like the rest of <i>man</i>kind. You attribute 
to motives and principles, unknown to
innocent and mirthful hearts, actions the result
of high spirits, and then venture to do that

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

which nothing upon earth but the height of
imprudence upon my part, or the extreme of
presumption on yours, could possibly account
for."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, dearest woman," said I.
"You cannot so much mistake me. I may
have erred&mdash;I may have presumed upon what
I had flattered myself was your kind and delightful 
preference; but do you&mdash;can you imagine, 
presumptuous as I admit my declaration
to be, that I can have any but the best, and
purest and most honourable motives."</p>

<p>"You are a very extraordinary person," replied 
Mrs. Fletcher Green. "You admit a
declaration, and talk of honourable motives.
Why, my dear Mr. Gurney, if I could bring
myself to believe you serious, I should attribute 
such conduct, coupled with such language,
to madness."</p>

<p>"Is there," said I, "is there,&mdash;and pray
hear me patiently, whatever may be the result,&mdash;is 
there anything like madness&mdash;except, perhaps, 
in having been betrayed into this confession,&mdash;is 

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

there anything like madness in a
devoted admiration of qualities, talents, virtues,
and accomplishments like yours? My whole
heart and soul, I repeat it, are devoted to you;
and if the tenderest care and affection&mdash;if a life
consecrated to you, can justify the appeal, assure 
yourself that no human being can be more
ardent, more sincere, than I am in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In what?" exclaimed the lady, who appeared 
rather alarmed at my earnestness, and,
who, withdrawing her hand, which I had clasped,
added, really agitated, "What <i>do</i> you mean?&mdash;what 
<i>can</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>"Recollect," said I, "dearest woman, your
axiom of last night as to faint hearts. You
have made me bold; do not make me entirely
wretched."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! are you in your senses?"
said Mrs. Fletcher Green.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied I. "All I seek on
earth is a return of that feeling which you
have inspired. To plight my faith at the altar&mdash;to 
vow eternal fidelity&mdash;to pledge my soul

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

to my affection&mdash;is the height of my ambition."</p>

<p>The moment I had uttered these words, the
look of astonishment and dismay which had
characterized her countenance disappeared; a
totally different expression illumined her features; 
I saw my advantage. Judge my delight
when my fair companion took my hand in hers,
and said in a tone of exquisite sweetness, "Are
you in earnest, Mr. Gurney? Am I to attribute
to such an honourable sentiment, and such a
desperate resolution, the conversation which
has just passed between us?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed you may," said I. "Only
let me have the permission to hope from your
sweet lips, and my happiness is complete."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Gurney," said Mrs. Fletcher
Green, with one of her sweetest looks, her
bright eyes twinkling like stars&mdash;"my dear
Mr. Gurney, what can I say?"</p>

<p>And at this particular juncture the door
opened, and Miss Kitty Carter appeared,
habited for her ride.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

<p>I never wished a pretty girl at Old Nick till
that moment.</p>

<p>"What!" said Miss Kate, "you two here
all this time! Upon my word, rather a lengthened 
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. I hope your conversation has
been interesting."</p>

<p>I hated her still more.</p>

<p>"It has, my dear Catherine," said Mrs.
Green&mdash;I wondered whether she would tell her
before my face what we had been talking about,&mdash;"and 
it has excited me very much; and, at
all events, shown me the necessity of taking one
step which I had hitherto omitted to take."</p>

<p>This step I anticipated was ordering me out
of the house; but I was mistaken. I confess
I thought that my fair Amelia appeared to be
struggling hard to conceal a laugh, and <i>that</i>
I considered rather as a display of want of
feeling; yet she certainly was struggling. Perhaps 
I was wrong in my judgment. And while
I was debating as to what I ought to do, having
just worked up to the very <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of my
affair, she turned to me, after having made a

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

signal to her sister, no doubt perfectly understood 
by <i>her</i>,&mdash;every family has its private code,&mdash;and 
said, with as much composure as if nothing 
whatever had occurred, "I must leave
you <i>now;</i> but remember you dine with us at
seven."</p>

<p>I bowed&mdash;blushed up to the eyes&mdash;she shook
hands with me&mdash;the result was evident&mdash;I was
accepted. Upon the strength of this encouragement, 
I shook hands sociably with Kate,
and bounded rather than walked down the
stairs, and so, forth into the street.</p>

<p>It is true I would have much rather that the
fair rider had been quite as long habiting herself 
as her sister said she would be, so that I
might have concluded my treaty, and signed
and sealed it on the lips of my dearest Amelia.
I had a strong notion at that time of signing
and sealing&mdash;however, the last shake of the
hand was enough. The not showing me up to
her sister, too, was conclusive. She was not
angry,&mdash;no, not she; it was, in fact, a settled
thing. Never was man so happy, so elated.

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

Wit, beauty, accomplishments, seven thousand
a-year, and a delightful sister-in-law to break
the <i>toujours perdrixism</i> of a matrimonial <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,&mdash;all 
this, and a fine place in the country,
horses, hounds, battues, archeries, races, <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>,
<i>soir&eacute;es dansantes</i>, and <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ners dinatoires;</i>&mdash;what
a vision! Should not I be popular?&mdash;should
not I be a star of the first magnitude with such
a wife, so well known in the gay and learned
world, without one bit of the Prussic acid of
bluism about herself? Harps, honeysuckles,
nectar, love, ecstasy, champagne, bowers, flowers,
music, painting,&mdash;all&mdash;everything. Gold cornices, 
ten-guinea boot-jacks, and every other
necessary of life could be afforded with seven
thousand pounds a-year; at least, so I thought
then; having only, at that period of my existence, 
as I have before observed, four hundred
and ninety pounds per annum&mdash;just enough to
find a moderately well-dressing man in shoe-strings.</p>

<p>How the hours seemed to crawl from four
until seven! Absorbed in a dream of delight.

<!-- vol 2 page 236 -->

I lay on my sofa, and conjured up the events of
the evening,&mdash;Captain Lark dying of envy;
Count Sko Sky, or whatever it was, in an
agony of despair; and I, handing my Amelia
to table, sitting next her whispering soft things,
and looking still softer ones. "Remember
seven!" said my Amelia, with a witchery more
impressive than the "Remember twelve!" of
the illustrious Siddons. I never was quite so
near being mad as during those three hours:
but, as the Italian proverb says, "<i>Non vien di
che non venga sera;</i>" and at length seven o'clock
came.</p>

<p>I flattered myself, although no beauty, that
I had made the best of myself. My neckcloth
was a pattern; my hair assiduously curled; and
my coat, of Stultz's best, displayed, with an
under-waistcoat of cerulean blue,&mdash;I speak of
years in which the more recent splendour of
the outer waistcoat was unknown;&mdash;and thus
elated, I proceeded to the scene of my past
triumph and my future glory. The very servants 
in the hall seemed to have obtained

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

information of the result of my assault of
the forenoon. I was received with marked
attention, deference, and civility; and ushered
into the drawing-room; where I found Lark,
the Count, Lord Somebody, whose name I
could not make out, and a learned philosopher, 
who had been invited, not more for his
own merits than because it was pleasant to a
very agreeable lady, who was also present, to
meet him; a young, awkward cousin of my
Amelia's, just from Eton, was the sixth of the
party, besides myself; neither our fair hostess
nor her sister having yet made their appearance.</p>

<p>We stood about the room looking at each
other as if we could gladly have cut each
other's throats. Lark and the Count remaining
aloof and talking apart, the philosopher flirting
with the blue lady, and the lord and the lout
appearing not to be conscious that I was made
of the same materials as themselves. It was a
painful quarter of an hour, broken only by the
arrival of a Mr. Flanneky, a red-faced gentleman 

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

from the Sister Island, with powder and
brass buttons, looking very much like a second
or third-rate butler&mdash;what part of the play he
was to act I did not exactly know, but I very
soon determined, let his province be what it
might, that he should have his <i>cong&eacute;</i> within ten
days of my accession to the throne of that
establishment.</p>

<p>At length my darling woman appeared, and
with her, Catherine. Her presence, like that
of the sun, diffused a genial warmth around&mdash;everybody 
seemed animated at her approach,
and I said to myself, "How delightful it will
be, when I call this creature my own, to see
her adorning and delighting every circle of
which she will be the centre!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Gurney," said the fascinating
woman, "how is your head?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Miss Carter, "upon my word it
is not fair to worry him with questions after that
long <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. What do you think. Lord
Melancourt? My sister and Mr. Gurney were
actually closeted three quarters of an hour

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

to-day; and do what I will, I cannot get her
to tell me what the subject of their conversation
was, and in general she is the most candid
creature alive."</p>

<p>His Lordship made a sort of unintelligible
noise, without moving a muscle of his face,
and looked at me as if I had been a pickpocket.
I felt annoyed and gratified&mdash;gratified that
Amelia had not confided our conversation to her
sister, and annoyed at the playfulness of manner 
in which she inquired after my head.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced. Of course Lord
Melancourt took Mrs. Green&mdash;I wished him
anywhere but where he was; the Sko Sky
count took the blue lady who had rank; the
philosopher took Catherine; and Lark, the
lout, and I, brought up the rear&mdash;Mr. Flanneky
bowing to me as I motioned him to go forward,
with a whispered "Oh no, I am at home."
Are you? thought I; then make the most of
it, for if you make this your home this day
three months, I'll eat you. I never saw such
an odious mulberry-faced animal in my life; he

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

seemed to me as ugly as Lucifer, and as old as
Methuselah&mdash;I believe, from what I have since
heard, he was then a fine florid gentleman of
about five-and-forty, and I was four-and-twenty&mdash;<i>voil&agrave; 
la diff&eacute;rence</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Flanneky took the bottom of the table;
Lord Melancourt the top, having my Amelia
on one side of him, and the blue on the other;
Kate, was separated from me by Lark, so that
between him and my aversion, the croupier,
was I posted&mdash;seeing Paradise, and feeling
something quite unlike it. I never passed
two more unpleasant hours in my life. I kept
my eyes fixed on my beloved widow, and
once or twice caught a responsive glance, but
I did not half like her manner to the viscount&mdash;it 
was clear they were old acquaintances;
they used conventional jokes, and made references 
to other days, and to events of which I
was ignorant. The blue lady began to lecture on
chemistry, and the learned professor descanted
much upon certain affinities and combinations
which, with a head full of affinities and combinations 

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

of a very different nature, did not in
the slightest degree interest me. Indeed I was
so tormented by what appeared to me Amelia's
inconsiderate conduct, that I rejoiced rather
than regretted when the ladies retired.</p>

<p>The after-dinner conversation was flat; the
Count entertained us with a history of his
various houses in different parts of Europe&mdash;the
professor drew his chair near Mr. Flanneky's,
and conversed in an under tone of voice&mdash;the 
lout went away, and the lord went to sleep;
and much after this fashion did we dissipate
another hour, when we repaired to the drawing-room. 
Here we found several "refreshers,"
and the party began to assume a liveliness
which it did not before possess; but to me its
increase was of no avail, for Mrs. Fletcher
Green was so occupied with her different female
visitors that I could not get an opportunity of
saying a word to her confidentially; she however 
rallied my spirits, by coming up to me and
bidding me stay, for there would be a <i>Th&egrave;</i>
and some music, late. This was balm to my

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

wounds, and I fell into conversation with
Captain Lark, who was really an agreeable
person, and who appeared more amiable to <i>me</i>
upon that occasion from not having apparently
any design either upon Amelia or Catherine.</p>

<p>Things went on in this way till about eleven
o'clock, when a gentleman past the middle age
made his appearance in the drawing-room,
whom I had never seen before: he seemed to
know everybody, and everybody seemed to
know him&mdash;he was in a morning dress, and had
evidently just arrived from a journey. I did
not half like his manner, either to Amelia or
Catherine; he had a free and easy way of
speaking, which sounded extremely unpleasant
to my ears, and the sort of swaggering command 
he appeared to assume, perfectly disgusted
me. He made no apology for appearing in
boots; called Miss Carter, "Kitty," as if he were
upon the best terms not only with himself but
her; and then, without asking Mrs. Fletcher
Green's permission, rang the bell, and when a
servant appeared, told him to order something

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

to eat, to be laid in the dinner-room, as he had
not dined, and was "infernally hungry."</p>

<p>I availed myself of the earliest opportunity
of making inquiries as to this self-important
gentleman at the fountain-head; and indeed I
intended to let Amelia see, without displaying
any very violent symptoms either of jealousy
or bad temper, that I did not quite like this
coarse man's familiarity.</p>

<p>"Pray," said I, stopping her, as she was
passing into the other room, "who may your
free and easy friend in the boots be?"</p>

<p>"Mercy on me!" said Amelia, "that's just
it,"&mdash;this was a favourite phrase of hers,&mdash;"now 
I can account for it all&mdash;don't you
know?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not I, upon my word," said I.</p>

<p>"I have been very remiss, then," replied she;
"come, let me introduce you to him&mdash;he is an
excellent creature&mdash;a little tired now, and perhaps 
not in the best humour; however, he will,
I am sure, be delighted to make your acquaintance."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

<p>"Yes," said I, "but do you know, I am not
quite so sure that I am equally anxious to make
his."</p>

<p>"Oh, fie, Mr. Gurney!" said Catherine, who
was standing close by; "why, Amelia will murder 
you!"</p>

<p>We had sidled forwards to the chair in which
the respectable gentleman had ensconced himself, 
and stood before him.</p>

<p>"Fletcher, dear," said my Amelia, "this is
Mr. Gurney, a most agreeable acquaintance we
have made since you left town. Mr. Gurney&mdash;my 
husband."</p>

<p>Now I only put it to any human being just to
imagine what my feelings were at this moment.
It would have been mercy in anybody to have
killed me instantly. I could have cried out as
Patkul did in his last agonies&mdash;"Will nobody
cut off my head?" In the morning I had
opened my heart to the beautiful widow&mdash;had,
as I fancied, been accepted; and here, in the
evening, was presented to her great fat living
husband. The folly, the stupidity of which I

<!-- vol 2 page 245 -->

had been guilty!&mdash;yet I had never seen the
man&mdash;I had never heard his name mentioned. I
concluded there was no Fletcher Green. Daly
never told me there was a husband&mdash;not a soul
ever referred to him. Mrs. Fletcher always
talked of <i>her</i> house, and <i>her</i> horses, and said, Will
you come and see <i>me?</i> It seemed they were ill
matched&mdash;he lived much in the country&mdash;his
pursuits were diametrically opposite to hers&mdash;they 
never interfered, and very seldom met,
although when they did, they were on the best
possible terms&mdash;but how should I know <i>that?</i> and
then how singularly applicable were her conversations 
about widows and faint hearts!&mdash;&mdash; I
bowed, and stammered out something&mdash;the <i>coup
de grace</i> was only wanting. Mrs. Fletcher
Green gave it with one of her sweetest smiles&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will come here to luncheon
to-morrow, Mr. Gurney, and improve your
acquaintance with Fletcher?"</p>

<p>She saw the shot had told&mdash;the kindness of
her heart overcame her love of mischief&mdash;and
withdrawing me for a moment, she said&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 246 -->

<p>"Forgive me for not having explained all this
before. It is somewhat a severe reflection upon
me that you should have heard so little of my
husband as to have fallen into the mistake of this
morning&mdash;forget it altogether&mdash;assure yourself
I appreciate your good opinion. I have not
breathed a syllable to Catherine, for both our
sakes. It is useless talking of what <i>might</i> be,
and which <i>cannot</i> be. Do, in kindness and
sincerity, be what you <i>may</i>, and what I am sure
you <i>will</i> be,&mdash;my friend. Now let us see if the
<i>Th&eacute;</i> is ready; and mind you are in good spirits&mdash;else 
I shall think you are offended with me,
and, what would be still more painful, that you
think ill of me."</p>

<p>I could make no answer to this soothing
speech, and suffered her to lead me like a child
to the table, where some of the laughing guests
were already seated. All the rest of the affair
was chaos. I heard sounds, but understood
nothing; and, despite of my kind hostess's
encouraging speeches, got away as soon as I
possibly could. Of Mr. Fletcher Green I saw

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

no more that night; and as to Mrs. Fletcher
Green, agreeable and delightful as she was, I
never had courage or spirits to see her again
after I quitted her charming house, about one
o'clock in the morning.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> attempt to describe the sensations under
which I laboured, when after a feverish restless
night, I arose from my bed the morning after
this incident, would be utterly vain and useless.
It seemed to me, that I was destined to become
the sport of fate, and as if the punishment for
all my sins were to be inflicted by the hands of
those dear creatures to whom my very heart and
soul were devoted.</p>

<p>It is true that Mrs. Fletcher Green not only
forgave my fault, but extenuated my folly; and,
with all her native sweetness, bade me forget
my error, seeming really not ill pleased with
the motive which had led to the indiscretion;
but the more I considered the matter, the more

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

thoroughly did I consider that I could not meet
her again&mdash;or, if ever such an event could by
any possibility take place. Time, the <i>edax
rerum</i>, the soother of sorrows, and the polisher
off of sharp edges which every where present
themselves in one's career through life, must
lend his aid to the re-union; and so, London
being thin, and the chance of my meeting my
imaginary widow, perhaps with her living husband, 
determined me upon removing myself
forthwith from the attenuated metropolis.</p>

<p>My inclinations pointed to the Isle of Wight,
as a fitting retreat under my misfortunes. I
felt somehow that the insular character of that
terrestrial paradise afforded a fancied security
from the inroads of London friends. For, although 
I hoped that nobody&mdash;Hull, perhaps,
excepted&mdash;would know anything of my misadventure, 
it was impossible for me to disburden 
my mind from the apprehension that
something might transpire in the course of
time, which would render me obnoxious to the
remarks of what is called society, and that

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

I might become the butt of the lampooner, or
the original of the caricaturist. Off I resolved
upon going, and accordingly booked myself for
Southampton, directing my servant to follow
with my gig and saddle horse, so that I might
range at liberty over the <i>ultima thule</i> of Great
Britain, and endeavour, by change of scene
and society, to get rid of the last great blunder
of my existence; which, as it was purely my
own, seemed more important in my eyes than
the indiscretion which I had so recently before
committed, in confiding the conduct of my
amour with Miss Haines to Mr. Daly.</p>

<p>I chose the Southampton road in preference
to that, which as I first proposed going to Ryde,
would have been the nearer. I liked Ryde for
its rurality, but I apprehend, if an extended pier
should be built, and a constant communication
established by steam-boats&mdash;a favourite vision
just at this time&mdash;it will, in a few years, be totally
spoiled. New streets will run where meadows
spread their verdant carpets, and country villas
and lodging-houses usurp the ground where

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

gardens bloom; till at last, row will rise above
row, and place above place, until the now nice
quiet village will present to the eye a glare of
yellow roads and red buildings arrayed on
the side of the hill, so as to give an effect at
a distance very much like that produced by
the perspective of a china plate. However, as
it is likely to last my time, I continue my affection 
for it, and should certainly have taken the
Portsmouth road, but for an incident which
occurred to me only a few months' before, and
which induced me to steer clear of that gay and
animated sea-port, than which, in war time, nothing 
could be much more lively.</p>

<p>That incident ought not to be omitted in my
collection of adventures:&mdash;</p>

<p>It happened that some years before the period
of which I am now treating, I had been staying
in the neighbourhood of Alverstoke with some
delightful people; indeed, I had so far prolonged 
my stay, that my poor mother, who
was then alive, was&mdash;with her usual sensitive 
anxiety for my matrimonial prospects&mdash;most 

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

solicitous to ascertain whether I had not
been fascinated by the bright eyes of some
Hampshire belle. But no&mdash;our pursuits were
infinitely less sentimental; and the earnest entreaties 
of my kind-hearted excellent host and
his charming wife to stay, needed nothing more
to make them successful than the continued round
of gaiety and merriment which we derived&mdash;if
not from trees and running brooks, most certainly 
from passing events in the neighbourhood.
The days flew rapidly, and six weeks, I believe,
slipped through my fingers almost imperceptibly.
However, at length, I felt it absolutely necessary
to tear myself away, and seized the opportunity
when they had accepted an engagement to a
neighbouring family; and having shaken hands
with both of them, promising speedily to return,
I quitted their hospitable roof.</p>

<p>It was with no small degree of pain I left
them, nor were the weather and time of the
year at all calculated to diminish the misery of
leaving a snuggery such as theirs; however, my
time had arrived, and I was to depart; and as I

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

wished, for many reasons, to be perfectly independent 
in my proceedings, I dispatched my
servant with my heavy luggage per morning
coach, reserving for myself merely a portmanteau, 
a <i>sac de nuit</i>, and a dressing-case; and
having made these arrangements, at five o'clock
in a misty, windy, wet and odious November
afternoon, stepped into mine host's carriage,
which was to convey me from his residence to
the landing, or rather, in my case, the embarking 
point at Gosport, whence I, bag, cloak,
dressing-case, and all, were to be ferried across
to Portsmouth; the carriage being to return
from the ferry, to take him and his amiable wife
to a dinner-party in their neighbourhood, their
engagement at which induced me to terminate
my visit to them that evening, rather than on
the morning of the following day.</p>

<p>All that had been projected in the programme 
was duly put into execution, up to my
departure per ferry-boat for Portsmouth. A
short delay on the part of the boatmen, and a
delicacy on mine in keeping my friend's carriage

<!-- vol 2 page 254 -->

so long as possibly to delay his subsequent
departure for his engagement, left me shivering
and shaking for some minutes on the Gosport
shore, in company with my portmanteau, bag,
and dressing-case. At length, however, since,
according to the ancient saw, time and patience
overcome all difficulties, I and my accessaries
were afloat; and after ten minutes' drenching
in the heaviest rain I ever suffered under, I
did what was extremely satisfactory to myself,
"come to the Point;" where upon landing, I
was assailed by various porters and others, who
proffered their services to carry my never-to-be-forgotten 
portmanteau, bag, and dressing-case 
to any ostelry or lodging I might choose
to select in the gay, agreeable, and in war
time crowded town of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>In those days the Crown was considered the
"crack" inn; and therefore I, who having been
sworn at Highgate, never drank small-beer
when I could get strong, unless I preferred
"swipes," proceeded forthwith to that extensive 
and well-conducted establishment: thither

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

I directed my nautical mercury to march, and
thither I followed him. I reached the Crown&mdash;alive, 
and perhaps well; but in regard of
drapery, dripping like a male Musidora. It
was nearly dark; and the wind whistled <i>out</i> of
the gaping gateway of the Inn right in my
teeth. I pulled a bell&mdash;the sound seemed lost
in the breeze; but having made a second effort,
a pale-faced waiter made his appearance.</p>

<p>"I want dinner, and a bed," said I.</p>

<p>"This way, Sir," said he; and forthwith
ushered me into what was called a coffee-room:
in which, I beg to observe, both the chimney
and the company were smoking. The floor
was sanded like the bottom of a bird-cage, and
probably for the same reason; and several gentlemen&mdash;so 
I considered them by their language&mdash;were 
grouped at narrow tables placed in little
slips, separated from each other by brown partitions, 
at the top of which were fixed brass
rods and red fustian curtains, like those by
which, in a country church, the churchwardens'
pew is specially distinguished.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

<p>I was tired, wet, and weary; and, above all,
uncomfortable in my mind&mdash;I had left a house
where comfort and hospitality reigned with
unsubjected sway; six weeks of social intercourse 
with a dear friend whom I loved, and
his family whom I esteemed, had spoiled me for
this sudden change to boisterous mirth, strange
faces, and unsavoury smells. I sought to be
alone, to live over again in thought the last
forty days, and recall and record in my mind
the pleasures and comforts I had experienced,
while, as far as external objects were concerned,
I might repose for a few hours, upon my recollections 
of the constant excitement in which my
delightful <i>s&eacute;jour</i> had kept me.</p>

<p>"Can I have no sitting room?" said I, drawing 
myself back from the door.</p>

<p>"This is the coffee-room," said the waiter,
somewhat sulkily; which I conclude, as a matter
of technicality, he thought a cogent, legal, and
constitutional reason for dining in it. "I don't
<i>think</i>," added he, looking first <i>at</i> my miserably
dripping hat and cloak, and secondly, in vain

<!-- vol 2 page 257 -->

<i>for</i> my servant, and the proportionate luggage
adequate to the wants and wishes of a gentleman 
who had the presumption to demur to
dine by himself&mdash;"I don't <i>think</i>"&mdash;as if such a
monster had any right to think&mdash;"that <span class="smcap">we</span>
<i>have</i> a sitting-room disengaged&mdash;I'll see&mdash;have
you any luggage, Sir?"</p>

<p>It was quite clear to me, that upon my
answer to this evidently leading question very
much depended; and what had I to boast?&mdash;I
have already said&mdash;a small portmanteau, a bag,
and a dressing-case.</p>

<p>"The porter has got my luggage," said I&mdash;pulling 
up a limp, wet shirt collar, in order to
look dignified.</p>

<p>And the waiter went to the porter, who still
stood under the gateway&mdash;and he took my luggage&mdash;and 
they whispered together&mdash;and the
pallid monster grinned contemptuously; and,
when he turned away from the amphibious
creature in the pea-jacket, and said "Chambermaid, 
take this gentleman's things to a bedroom," 
the look he gave, and the peculiar

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

emphasis which he placed upon the word <i>gentleman</i>, 
convinced me, that whatever my own
opinion might be of Mr. Gilbert Gurney, the
waiter at the Crown Inn at Portsmouth did
not in any degree sympathize with me in
my estimation of that highly respectable personage.</p>

<p>Having delivered my moveables to the chambermaid, 
the fellow went into some other room
to inquire of the head of the establishment,
who had not stirred, whether I might, by his
special grace and favour, be permitted to put
five or six shillings extra into his pocket, by
the enjoyment of fire and candle in a room "to
myself," as the people say.</p>

<p>I then had an opportunity of surveying the
chambermaid herself&mdash;Maid! thought I&mdash;Gorgon! 
It would not be more preposterous to
call a patriarch, who at seventy-two shakes his
tongs-like legs over the saddle of a post-horse&mdash;post-<i>boy</i>&mdash;than 
to call thee, maid! However,
it was of no sort of use to disagree with her;&mdash;like 
Lord Grizzle, in Tom Thumb, when

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

declining the combat with the giantess, I felt,
and almost said</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"I will not fight with thee!"</p>

</div>

<p>and accordingly, threw into my countenance an
expression of urbanity, mingled with a desire
to know what she was going to do with me.</p>

<p>"Sally!" screamed the Brobdignagian, "what
bed-rooms <i>is</i> disengaged?&mdash;a gentleman wants
a bed!"</p>

<p>A face not less ugly than that of the questioner, 
presented itself over the balusters, resembling 
nothing I had ever seen except a full
moon in a fog.</p>

<p>"What gentleman?" said the creature.</p>

<p>"Comes by the Gosport ferry," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Oh!"&mdash;and, after a pause, "there's only
number two hundred and eighteen."</p>

<p>"Up-stairs, if you please," said my first
conductress.</p>

<p>"I'll stop one moment," said I, "to see if
I can have a room to dine in."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

<p>"Yes, Sir, you can," said the waiter, "I'll
show it you now."</p>

<p>And so he did; and shall I ever forget it?&mdash;it 
was a little room opening directly under the
gate-way, three-cornered, like a cocked hat-box, 
half covered with a dirty carpet, which, as
it was agitated by the wind drifting under the
door, undulated like a playhouse sea.</p>

<p>What was this to me?&mdash;at <i>my</i> age it mattered
little; and all the inns in England put together
could not have yielded half the comforts I had
left behind me on the other side of the water;
so I gave an assenting nod, begged to have a
fire lighted, and ordered a boot-jack; which,
being brought, I found the task of "unbooting,"
one of much greater difficulty than I had anticipated&mdash;those 
excellent and useful coverings
for the legs had been saturated during my
brief yet pelting voyage, and required a force
to be withdrawn which I had not foreseen.
The deed, however, was done; and, having installed 
my feet in a pair of most accommodating
slippers, I ordered some fish, and a broiled fowl

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

with mushroom sauce, for dinner, and proceeded
towards my dormitory, my six-feet Thais "leading 
the way."</p>

<p>We began to mount the stairs as the clock was
striking six, and continued to ascend in nearly
a perpendicular direction for a considerable
time; we then seemed to take a south-westerly
direction; and, shortly after, rose rapidly up a
precipitous ladder, railed on either side, and
reached that, which, when it was opened, appeared 
to me to be the lantern of a light-house.
It was a pentagonal room, three sides of which
were windows, on the fourth side stood a miserable-looking 
bed, and the fifth was the door-way. 
This was number two hundred and eighteen.</p>

<p>"Why," said I; "there is no fire-place
here."</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said Thais, surveying me from</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Head to foot, from top to toe;"</p>

</div>

<p>"do you want a fire?&mdash;this is the only room we
have&mdash;it's uncommon pleasant in the day time&mdash;in 

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

clear weather you can see from the Nab
to the Needles with the naked eye."</p>

<p>The idea of anything naked in such a room
at such a season made me shudder&mdash;all I said
was, "I don't think it particularly snug for
this time of year."</p>

<p>"There a'n't no other room, Sir," said my
patroness: saying which, she banged down a
rather tarnished tin candlestick upon a painted
deal table which stood under one of the shutterless 
windows, and having deposited by its side
one solitary towel, and a little hard lump of
yellow soap, looking like a bit of bee's wax,
she disappeared, banging the door after her with
a noise which made all the frames and panes of
my winter conservatory rattle.</p>

<p>In this distant and desolate spot, I changed
my dress, and although the climate was none of
the mildest, I soon began to feel the comfort
of dry clothing; and thus young in years,
and buoyant in spirits, notwithstanding my
various little discomfitures, the little ills by
which I seemed to be encompassed became

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

matters of mirth, and when I sat myself down
on the ricketty chair which graced my narrow
bed's side, I could not choose but laugh at my
own miseries.</p>

<p>In some twenty or twenty-five minutes I had
completed my toilette, and felt an anxious
desire to find my refectory. Then came a new
difficulty: I quitted my observatory, and to use
the phrase of Messrs. Lunardi, Sadler, Green
and Co., the aeronauts, "began to descend;" this
was a matter of no great intricacy as far as the
last topmost ladder was concerned, but when I
got into what might fairly be called the House,
seeing that there was no finger-post in the
passages, I was puzzled, and compelled to proceed 
somewhat cautiously; for nothing is more
likely to lead a man into a scrape than turning
into a wrong room at a house open for the
reception of a general company.</p>

<p>Guided I suppose by the natural instinct for
food with which every animal, biped or quadruped, 
is imbued, rather than by any knowledge of
the <i>Carte du pays</i>, I reached what might be considered 

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

the habitable part of the Inn; and at the
end of a sort of corridor leading to the front
rooms on the first floor, I encountered a group
of pretty faces smiling&mdash;and when does a face
look so sweetly as when it smiles on one?&mdash;and 
earnestly and intently looking at me; one
particularly seemed to regard me with the
deepest interest, not unmixed with veneration,
a tribute for which, at my time of life, I was
not altogether prepared. I "kept the even
tenor of my way," and encountered at the
corner of the passage the huge Glumdalca
who had chaperoned me to the light-house&mdash;she
looked awe-struck, and glided by me with a
curtesy so profound that she seemed to sink at
least two feet into the floor as she passed me.</p>

<p>Onward I went, until I reached the head of
a staircase, which by the manner in which the
breeze was blowing upwards, I knew to be
the one which led to the sty in which I was
destined to be fed. Judge my surprise at
being stopped on the first step, <i>ce n'est que
le premier pas qui co&ucirc;te</i>, by a portly, well

<!-- vol 2 page 265 -->

powdered, gentlemanly looking man, with a
blue coat, brass buttons, white waistcoat, and
black unmentionables.</p>

<p>"This way, Sir," said the landlord, for it
was he who spoke; "this, Sir, if you please, is
the way to <i>your</i> dinner room."</p>

<p>"No," said I, "I believe you mistake&mdash;<i>my</i>
room is down-stairs, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg a thousand pardons," replied mine
host, bowing to the ground, "I <i>did</i> mistake,
Sir&mdash;but that is, I hope, rectified. This way&mdash;lights, 
here&mdash;lights&mdash;this way, Sir."</p>

<p>The door of a handsome apartment flew open,
and I discovered before a blazing fire, such as
would have entirely consumed and devoured my
little three-cornered room under the gateway,
a table covered with plate fit for the infallible
Bishop of Rome to take his solitary dinner at;
a huge couch had been dragged from its
ordinary anchorage, to a position at right angles
with the fire-place, and before it stood a sofa-table 
whereon lay sundry books, the day's newspaper 
from London, a silver inkstand, and

<!-- vol 2 page 266 -->

all the comfortable accessories to reading and
writing.</p>

<p>"This is a better room than the other," said
I, with the confident air of a man who utters an
incontrovertible truism.</p>

<p>"I thought, Sir," said the landlord, bowing
profoundly, "you might have letters to write&mdash;our 
post does not leave till late&mdash;I hope, Sir,
you will find everything as comfortable as we
can make it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I, "I dare say I shall
do extremely well&mdash;let me have dinner as soon
you can."</p>

<p>"Instantly, Sir," was the answer; and mine
host disappeared.</p>

<p>True to his word, five minutes had scarcely
elapsed ere he re-appeared, bearing in his hands
a massive silver tureen of soup, which I had
not ordered, but which he deposited upon the
table, a train of waiters following, one bearing
a silver soup plate, a second a ladle, a third a
lemon, and a fourth something else.</p>

<p>"I ventured, Sir," said the landlord, bowing

<!-- vol 2 page 267 -->

most reverentially, "to add the soup&mdash;His
Highness the Stadtholder was pleased to approve
of it very much, when his Highness was here."</p>

<p>With such authority for its excellence, what
could I say?&mdash;nothing&mdash;I bowed assent and
forgiveness to the landlord, who retired to a
respectful distance, and under the undivided
surveillance of himself and three most vigilant
subalterns, who stood with their eyes rivetted
on me, and all of whom I most earnestly wished
at old Nick, I swallowed what appeared to me
some extremely bad broth&mdash;very unlike anything
I had ever tasted before and not at all like anything 
I ever wished to taste again. However,
the assiduities of mine host were not so to be
repaid, and when I had finished my task, I said,
"Admirable soup, indeed."</p>

<p>I ordered some Madeira,&mdash;mine host himself
vanished&mdash;I had scarcely compounded the fish
sauce, before, like Aladdin's genius, he stood again
before me, holding in his hand a bottle of the
wished-for wine. I was startled at the quantity, and
explained that a pint would have been enough.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 268 -->

<p>"Oh, Sir!" said my obsequious caterer, "it
makes no difference how much you drink&mdash;it
would be a pity to divide it&mdash;Gordon's wine,
Sir,&mdash;has been twice to the East Indies, and
has been in <i>my</i> house fifteen years&mdash;I have but
very little of it left. Fetch a glass here," said
he, in a loud, authoritative tone to one of the
waiters; "allow me, Sir, to pour some out."</p>

<p>I submitted to his overweening kindness, and
felt quite relieved when he again took his departure 
to fetch with his own proper hands my
broiled fowl, which I found to my surprise
associated with two <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, one of cutlets and
the other a fricandeau, and moreover ushered in
with an announcement from mine host that the
time had been so short it was impossible to do
more, but that he had ventured to add a couple
of woodcocks by way of second course.</p>

<p>Thus <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> I nearly sank under the attentions
which were proffered, and which naturally produced 
an increased effect upon me, as affording
so striking a contrast to the reception which
awaited me on my first arrival. I hurried

<!-- vol 2 page 269 -->

through the ceremonies of dinner as fast as I
could, and having got the room clear of the main
body of my tormentors, a bottle of claret placed
on the table&mdash;for in vain had I mentioned port,
and proposed a pint&mdash;I began to think how I
could dispose of the rest of the evening until
bed-time, and accordingly inquired of one of
the waiters who was still occupying himself in
arranging the fire, if there was any play that
night.</p>

<p>The answer was in the affirmative&mdash;Mr. Pope,
of Covent Garden Theatre, acted Alexander
the Great.</p>

<p>"At what time does it begin?" said I.</p>

<p>"It has begun, Sir," said the man.</p>

<p>"Do you think," said I, "that I should find
room if I were to go, after I have finished my
wine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir!" said the man, with a look of
confident security, "my master will of course
take care that there shall be a place secured for
<i>you</i>, Sir."</p>

<p>This I thought particularly civil, because it

<!-- vol 2 page 270 -->

must be wholly disinterested. I thanked him,
and said I would avail myself of his civility;
and then, restored to a blissful state of repose, I
sipped my claret, and drank, tacitly but warmly,
the healths of the excellent friends whom I had
left on the opposite shore; and thence my
thoughts wandered along the chain of circumstances 
and events, with which I had been
entangled, until I fell into a kind of reverie,
whence I was aroused by the entrance of my
ever active, always vigilant landlord, who,
having first informed me that the waiter had
mentioned my intention of visiting the theatre,
added that he had himself been there and secured 
accommodation for me, with which he hoped
I should be satisfied, and that whenever I should
be pleased to go he would be in readiness to
attend me.</p>

<p>I begged to assure him that such particular
attention was by no means necessary, and that I
knew Portsmouth sufficiently well to find my way
from one part of High Street to another, without
giving him so much trouble. This declaration

<!-- vol 2 page 271 -->

was received by my genius with, "Oh, Sir!
you are <i>so</i> good;" and a smile, perfectly indescribable.</p>

<p>"By the way," said I, as he was leaving
the room, "will you send somebody with a
light&mdash;I must go to my room; or&mdash;" continued I,
"perhaps you will let them bring me my gloves
and handkerchief, which I have left on the table
in number 218, I think."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir," said mine host,
"your sleeping room adjoins this&mdash;I believe
there are lights already there&mdash;number 2."</p>

<p>Saying which he threw open the <i>battants</i>, and
I followed him into an apartment abundantly
stored with comforts and luxuries&mdash;two candles
were burning on the dressing table, and hot
water bubbled in kettles by the fire. Having
inquired if I wished for any thing more, and
having received a negative reply, he retired;
and I having pulled on my boots, took my
gloves and handkerchief, rang the bell to
announce my approach, and walked down stairs.</p>

<p>At the bar a few persons were assembled,

<!-- vol 2 page 272 -->

evidently with one and the same object&mdash;to
look at <i>me</i>, which they did with similar marks
of respect and interest to those which had been
exhibited by the spectators at the top of the
staircase, before dinner; they seemed to hold
their beards as I appeared, with the exception of
one old lady, whom I distinctly heard say, "God
bless him," as I passed her. I still went on,
and at the door found my landlord again, attended 
by two persons armed with lighted lanthorns, 
who, as I quitted the threshold, moved
forwards towards the playhouse, mine host himself 
walking a little in advance of me.</p>

<p>We reached the unpretending fane, and I
found myself rapidly transported by a side door,
and narrow carpeted passage into a remarkably
comfortable private box, where I was safely deposited 
by my landlord, and a gentlemen, to me
unknown, but who almost instantly returned, and
bowing most respectfully, presented me with a
bill of the play. I established myself snugly
behind the trellage blind, and enjoyed the excellent 
acting of Pope in peace and quietude.

<!-- vol 2 page 273 -->

There were sundry disturbances in the pit, and
some junior naval officers had located themselves 
in one of the boxes up stairs over the
stage with long four horse whips, with which at
stated periods they performed certain evolutions
perhaps not altogether calculated for the interior
of a theatre, but which were to me particularly
agreeable on account of their novelty.</p>

<p>When the play was over, I felt that I had
had enough of pleasure for once, and did not
stay to see the farce. Lucky indeed was it
that I did not, as far as my lanthorn bearers were
concerned, for when I quitted the house, there
I found them at the door ready to light me
back again&mdash;I could not choose but avail myself
of their services, and in such state I reached
mine inn.</p>

<p>As I went into the house I met in the
passage two remarkably pretty girls, whose
faces I recollected having seen at the top of
the staircase, when I was descending from my
sky-parlour to dinner. I was much struck by a
sort of brilliancy of joyous expression in their

<!-- vol 2 page 274 -->

countenances, although I could not help thinking 
that they had done their good looks something 
like injustice, by wearing bright orange-coloured 
silk handkerchiefs over their shoulders.
A momentary glance of mine eye, sufficed to
suffuse the downy cheeks of one of them with
blushes, and dropping a profound curtsey, her
eyes cast down upon the floor, she looked as if
she thought she had been too presumptuous, and
shrank as it were, from the hall into the bar, in
which movement she was followed by her,
whom I imagined to be her sister.</p>

<p>In those days I was very abstemious; however 
a play always makes one thirsty, and tires
one, and besides I had been cold and wet, and
I was rather out of spirits, and so I dissipated 
in a glass of negus and a biscuit, and
again fell into one of those waking dreams
which are not unfrequently generated in the
solitude of an inn, where, although the body
resteth for an hour or so, the mind is all abroad.
When I rang to announce my retirement to
bed, no Glumdalca was to be seen; although

<!-- vol 2 page 275 -->

from one room to the other was but a step,
in came a fair, small-featured, blue-eyed personage, 
with a forehead like snow, over which
revelled a profusion of light hair. She held in
her trembling hand a candlestick, the undulating 
motion of which betrayed her agitation.
She, however, like her young mistresses, if
mistresses they really were, wore in her cap
an orange-coloured bow. I set down the prevalence 
of this fashion as the result of some
recent election, in which orange had been the
distinctive badge of one of the candidates. I
bade the fair young creature good night, but
she seemed too much alarmed to be capable
of enjoying even the very smallest show of
civility; and when she retired with a curtsey,
I retired to rest, wearied by my day's exploits, 
and preeminently satisfied with my treatment 
at the Crown.</p>

<p>In the morning, breakfast much of the same
school with the dinner, was served; and at
eleven I desired the waiter to order me a chaise
to Chichester. He went, but in a few moments 

<!-- vol 2 page 276 -->

the indefatigable landlord himself arrived
to say that the horses would be out directly,
but that he had directed that they should be
put to a chariot belonging to a gentleman in
the Isle of Wight, who had left the carriage
there, and who he was perfectly confident would
be too happy that I should do him the honour
of using it.</p>

<p>When the current is setting smoothly along,
in the very direction we wish, it always appears 
to me to be excessively absurd to throw
pebbles into it to ruffle its surface, and perhaps
divert it from its course. I therefore, after
the manner I had adopted during the preceding 
evening, merely bowed assent, and naturally
preferring a well-stuffed carriage to a hard and
rattling "yellow," permitted my kind landlord
to go his own way to work.</p>

<p>Then came the alloy&mdash;the bill&mdash;which I admit 
<i>did</i> appear to me to be of a considerable
amount;&mdash;but to be sure, the accommodations 
were excellent&mdash;the wine so good&mdash;the
<i>cuisine</i> perfect, always excepting and never

<!-- vol 2 page 277 -->

forgetting the stadtholder's soup. One charge,
however, puzzled me&mdash;it was before Daly had
enlightened me as to the customs of Wales&mdash;besides 
I was not in Wales&mdash;and that charge
was, one pound one shilling for "ringers." I
was struck by this, and ventured to inquire
what it meant. I was informed that the bells
of the parish church had been rung in honour
of my arrival and residence within its precincts&mdash;luckily 
for my comfort, before I was awake.
I thought it odd, and foolish; but nevertheless,
the thing was done, and the bells could not
be unrung; so I paid the bill as it was presented 
to me, to the no small deterioration of
my property, and stepped into the comfortable
carriage of the unconscious gentleman in the
Isle of Wight, amidst a profusion of bows and
curtsies, my landlord standing at the door uncovered, 
the powder from his head blowing
up High Street like snow drifting before the
wind.</p>

<p>At Chichester I stopped to pay a visit&mdash;the
link between me and Portsmouth was broken;

<!-- vol 2 page 278 -->

and I amused myself by reciting to my friends
the particulars of my adventure at the Crown&mdash;the 
moral of my tale being the exhibition of
the difference of accommodation which exists
in every inn, regulated according to the whim
of the master, or the circumstances of the guest&mdash;and 
there the matter ended.</p>

<p>The next day I went on to Brighton, where
my servant had previously arrived, and took
up my residence in Dorset Gardens&mdash;a place
then the more esteemed by me, for reasons which
I need not now record; and felt, I can scarcely
describe how, because I perceived in the Brightonians 
none of the devoted civility, or servility, 
perhaps, which had so distinctly distinguished 
the people of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>But time unravels most things&mdash;Junius will
be discovered at last. The very next morning
a friend did me the kindness to breakfast with
me; and, having concluded the meal, proposed
a walk until luncheon. I, too lazy to go up-stairs 
to my dressing-room, ordered my servant
to bring me my boots; he did so&mdash;but he brought

<!-- vol 2 page 279 -->

not those which I intended to wear. See upon
what trifles great events sometimes turn&mdash;he
went for another pair, leaving those which he
had previously brought.</p>

<p>"Those are good-looking boots," said my
friend the Colonel&mdash;"Hoby's?"</p>

<p>"No," said I&mdash;"they were made by a man
of the name of O'Shaugnessy&mdash;Paget Daly
O'Shaugnessy, in St. James's Street."</p>

<p>"Very nice boots indeed," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "and what is best of all, fit
me remarkably well, although not made for
me; he had faithfully promised me a pair of
boots for the day I left Town; but, as usual,
failed me; and when my man went for them
they were yet unmade. However, he sent me
these, made expressly for the Prince of Orange;
and, odd enough to say, they fit me better than
any he ever made for me purposely."</p>

<p>"That's curious enough," said the Colonel;
"but if I had been you, I should have made
my servant scratch out the Prince's name,
which is written on the inside of them, else it

<!-- vol 2 page 280 -->

might appear that you had appropriated His
Highness's property to your own use."</p>

<p>"What!" said I "is the Prince's name
<i>there?</i>"</p>

<p>"Here," said the Colonel, "read." And
so I did; and sure enough there were the words
"H. S. H. The Prince of Orange, 789,465;" the
figures meaning to imply that Mr. Paget Daly
O'Shaugnessy had himself made seven hundred
and eighty-nine thousand, four hundred and
sixty-five pairs of boots, as watchmakers put an
infinity of figures upon their watches, beginning,
as I believe, at twenty or thirty thousand. I was
prodigiously startled at this discovery, and I
must admit somewhat mortified.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "I see it all&mdash;now can I
account for my retrograde promotion from the
conservatory; from the skylight to the drawing-room 
at the Crown. Now do I know why I
was looked at with respect and veneration.
Now do I comprehend why those pretty girls
wore orange handkerchiefs, and the fairest of
chambermaids trembled. Now do I understand 

<!-- vol 2 page 281 -->

why I was blessed by old ladies, and
lighted to the play with lanthorns; why the
bells were rung in mine honour, and why I
was drenched with Stadtholder's soup. These,
my dear Colonel, are the boots I wore at Portsmouth; 
then saturated, since dried; from these
very boots did the people there derive their
notions of my character and consequence, and
to these boots am I indebted for paying the
landlord of that excellent inn at least four
pounds more than I should have paid, if I had
worn anonymous leggings!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Colonel, "as Titus Andronicus 
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">If you had gone all <i>bootless</i> to them,
They would not have heeded you."</p>

</div>

<p>"I confess," replied I, "my vanity is a little
wounded. <i>N'importe</i>&mdash;I was well lodged, and
the landlord well paid&mdash;if he is content, so am
I; and I never will use the word <span class="smcap">boots</span> reproachfully 
again as long as I live."</p>

<p>Strange as this adventure may appear, it

<!-- vol 2 page 282 -->

must be quite clear, that a visit to the Crown
upon the present occasion, was by no means
desirable, because I should have destroyed a
beautiful vision which the family had conjured
up, and been myself degraded into a private
gentleman, travelling with a gig and a couple
of horses&mdash;sad falling off from royalty. This
it was that induced me to take to the Dolphins 
at Southampton; whence, after the arrival 
of my man, I proceeded in the packet,
which sailed in the afternoon, to Cowes, there
being no other mode of proceeding; and the
wind dying away, we were fortunate, as we
imagined, in landing at the Vine Inn in about
six hours after our departure from the main
land.</p>

<p>To me a little delay and a little <i>d&eacute;tour</i> were
matters rather of satisfaction than complaint. I
became more at my ease every hour that increased
the distance between me and the captivating
woman whose independence of manner and
frankness of character had been then, as I
fancied it, my ruin; and it was not until I

<!-- vol 2 page 283 -->

got to the back of the island, that I felt as if
I had secured myself against the self-reproaches
with which my exhibition at her house had
loaded me.</p>

<p>In that sweet island did I remain for three
whole months, in a state of mind scarcely describable. 
Deceived and defeated by Daly&mdash;thrown 
over by Mrs. Green&mdash;and full of anxiety
to hear from my brother Cuthbert, to whom I
began to think I should most certainly go&mdash;I was
more like a madman than anything else, and
so indeed I think I was considered. However,
time and patience, my old remedies, stood me
in good stead upon that, as they have upon
more recent occasions; and having worn out&mdash;which 
is the only word I can find for it&mdash;a 
period which I fancied sufficient to deaden
the feelings of regret by which I had been so
severely assailed, I resolved upon once more
visiting London, in order to consult the only
real friend I had as to the expediency of my
oriental voyage.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to carry my prudential scheme into
execution, I despatched my servant with the
horses, by the "ferry of the four feet" to Portsmouth; 
and, directing him to secure me an
inside place for the following Tuesday, in any
coach which went from any other inn than the
Crown, and to send me back word what the
name of the conveyance was for which I was
booked, I proceeded "according to advice"
upon that morning by Beazley's packet, almost
before it was light, and reached the motley town
in which I had once unconsciously shone in a very
different character; where having landed close
by the baths, I smuggled myself into the stage,
most desirous of escaping the recognition of

<!-- vol 2 page 285 -->

any of the self-made dupes of my imaginary
rank.</p>

<p>As soon as I got into the coach, I found
myself in company with a middle-aged gentleman, 
whom I then thought old, but in whose
countenance I saw some favourable indications
"of a mind within;" and although, at that
period, people of sense had not <i>be-deville-d</i>
themselves with the solemn absurdities of
phrenology, I fancied that, without being either
as civil as Spurzheim, or as bitter as Gall, I
might calculate upon enjoying what, at that
period of my life, I was not averse from (in
hopes of picking up information and knowledge),&mdash;some 
rational and agreeable conversation 
with my companion during our journey
to London.</p>

<p>The ice of English formality was upon this
occasion, as usual, broken by the English absurdity 
of a trite remark upon the weather.
"It is very wet to-day," said by one man to
another, while the rain is pattering down upon

<!-- vol 2 page 286 -->

the roof of the carriage which contains them,
and the bubbles in the puddles are hopping
up like so many fairy water-sprites, is, as everybody 
acknowledges, both superfluous and ridiculous; 
but it leads to other things, and the
assenting "very" to the obvious remark, sows
the seed of future conversation. So it happened 
then, and in less than half the distance
to Horndean, I had received from my companion, 
the information that he was an army
surgeon, who had come home on leave of absence 
from Jamaica, on account of ill health;
but that, although he had been sufficiently
unwell to justify the permission he had obtained, 
his main object in coming to England
was to make arrangements for carrying out
his wife upon his return to the West Indies:
she having written out to him to represent
her situation in this country, alone, and, as it
were, widowed, beyond measure irksome and
distressing to her feelings.</p>

<p>He accounted to me for not having taken

<!-- vol 2 page 287 -->

her with him in the first instance&mdash;for he spoke
of her in terms of such devotion and affection,
that I could not help asking him why she had
not been the companion of his first voyage&mdash;by 
describing her health to have been
extremely delicate, and by the fact that he
had exchanged from the regiment to which he
then belonged, and which had returned home
before the period at which we were speaking;
so that by the exchange&mdash;which was a favourable 
one to him, financially and professionally&mdash;his 
plans had been considerably altered, and
his probable residence in the colonies very
much protracted.</p>

<p>I liked him extremely, and was almost vexed
when, at Liphook, a rather pertish, forward-looking 
young man&mdash;about my own age at
that time&mdash;stepped into the coach, and disturbed 
our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. Upon the accession of
our third member, we relapsed into silence;
and, except upon the occasion of seeing a man
thrown from his horse between Milford and
Godalming, little occurred worthy of notice,

<!-- vol 2 page 288 -->

till we reached the Crown at Guildford, where
we found the cold round of beef, the hot
leg of mutton, and the pickles and potatoes,
ready for consumption; the work of devastation
having been, previous to our entrance, commenced 
by a gentleman, who soon informed us
that we were to have the pleasure of his company
to complete the <i>parti carr&eacute;</i> in our conveyance.</p>

<p>There is something extremely socializing
in the community of interests of a small party
on a cold day round a good fire, at a luncheon.
We drank ale, and port wine, and hot brandy
and water&mdash;offered each other snuff&mdash;cracked
jokes, and began, as the warmth of the
room thawed us, to feel ourselves sufficiently
at home and comfortable, to regret the call
of the "Faulkner" of his day, couched in
the emphatic words, "<i>Now</i>, gentlemen, if
you please," which was to remove us from
the magic semi-circle formed round the hearth
of mine host of the Crown.</p>

<p>We entered the coach, evidently pleased
with each other, and in as different a humour

<!-- vol 2 page 289 -->

from that in which we were when three of us got
out of it, as can well be conceived. I felt quite
at my ease, and had no scruple in relating
my adventure detailed in the preceding chapter,
which appeared to my companions, when they
had heard my narrative, nearly as inexplicable
as it had been to myself, until I reached the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> at Brighton.</p>

<p>"I," said Mr. Dillington&mdash;so was our last
acquaintance named&mdash;"<i>I</i> have recently been
engaged in an adventure; but mine is a more
straight-forward, matter of fact affair&mdash;to me
of the most agreeable nature, I admit. I came
into this neighbourhood only the day before
yesterday, meaning to remain here some time,
but the magical influence of a pair of the
brightest eyes I ever beheld, has upset all my
projects, and carries me to London, in spite
of all the pressing entreaties of my hospitable
friends in Surrey."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "such things are irresistible.
I conclude, by your outline, that yours is a
love-at-first-sight case?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 290 -->

<p>"I flatter myself," said Dillington, who
was extremely well qualified for a lady-killer,
"I flatter myself that it is so, on both sides.
All I know is, that I am speeding my way
to town, to meet my adorable Dulcinea
at the Piazza door of Covent Garden play-house, 
where I am to have the happiness&mdash;at
her own suggestion&mdash;of accompanying her to
witness the performance of the play, 'blest
as the immortal gods,' fondly sitting by her
side, to</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Hear and see her all the while
Softly speak, and gently smile.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"Rather an easy conquest," said the army
surgeon; "is it to be a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te?</i>"</p>

<p>"I rather suspect not," said Dillington;
"I think she talked of some elderly body,
in the shape of an aunt, who was to accompany
her, and play Propriety; however I fancied
that, by way of a <i>premier pas</i>, I had succeeded
capitally. She positively refused to tell me
where she lived, and, I think, has made the

<!-- vol 2 page 291 -->

assignation in order to try the extent of my earnestness 
and anxiety about her, before she
reposes a more extensive confidence in me."</p>

<p>"May I ask," said I, "is she maid, wife,
or widow?"</p>

<p>"I did not trouble her with any questions
on that point," said Dillington; "she wore a
wedding-ring, which she flourished in my face two
or three times during our journey together, while
drawing the whitest of hands over the brightest
of eyes. I had not more than an hour and
three-quarters to make my play; I got into
the coach this side Petersfield, and was forced
<i>malgr&eacute; moi</i>, to stop at Godalming to fulfil the
engagement, which was to have lasted ten days;
but which, although I lost her at the moment,
has been curtailed of its fair proportions in
order to regain my adorable <i>incognita;</i> and,
to tell truth, I think I lost little by that, for
a robust, healthy-looking female, 'a nursing
mother,' with a baby and a boy of eight or
nine years' old, were crammed into the coach
at Milford, booked all the way to London, so

<!-- vol 2 page 292 -->

that all confidential conversation in the way of
business must of course have ceased at that
point. This evening I shall see her again, and
all will be well."</p>

<p>"Oh!" sighed my opposite neighbour, a
plain pale man, with white whiskers and a short
nose; "if you could but guess the pain, Sir,
that your success gives me, you would not speak
so thoughtlessly of your happiness. I, too,
am in pursuit of a lady&mdash;one to whom I am
heart and soul devoted&mdash;who has treated me
hardly and harshly&mdash;I never fancied I could
be so weak and silly; but, as you say, man is
not master of himself, and</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'When a lady's in the case,
All other things of course give place.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"Then, Sir," said I, "I presume you are
actually on your road to the Barley Mow?"</p>

<p>"Barley Mow!" said Mr. Lackington; "no,
Sir; I am on my way to a village near town, in
which my charming, capricious devil of a widow
lives; but whether she will be in a sunshiny

<!-- vol 2 page 293 -->

humour or a cloudy one when I arrive there,
is to <i>me</i> a matter of great uncertainty."</p>

<p>"But I conclude," said Dillington, "you
don't allow yourself to weep and wail without
some consolation?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lackington, "I had the pleasure
of her exclusive society at Eastbourn for a
fortnight last autumn, where we were as happy
as two turtle-doves, until something crossed her
mind&mdash;or perhaps, I <i>may</i> say, her temper&mdash;and
she started off for London, leaving a short note
behind her, telling me my following her would be
perfectly useless, since she had resolved utterly
to cut my acquaintance for the future."</p>

<p>"The unkindest cut of all," said I. "And
yet your lingering, longing love remains, and
you are determined to try your fortune at a
reconciliation."</p>

<p>"Even so, Sir," said Lackington, heaving a
deep-drawn sigh, which seemed to come from
the very bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, gentlemen," said the army
surgeon, "I have been listening to your conversation, 

<!-- vol 2 page 294 -->

and I <i>must</i> say that the morals of my
countrymen and countrywomen do not appear
to have improved during my absence from
England; assure yourselves that the pursuits in
which you seem both to be engaged, however
exciting at the moment, bring with them anything 
but solid gratification&mdash;independently of
their actual impropriety, they generally produce 
causes for repentance and sorrow. If a
man fail in the object of his heart, he becomes
miserable himself&mdash;if he succeed, the chances
are he makes another more miserable still; rely
upon it, that wrong never comes right, and that
no man is truly respectable until he marries, and
devotes his cares, his anxiety, and his attentions
to a gentle and confiding partner, whose virtues
and merits soothe him in adversity, and give
new brightness to prosperity."</p>

<p>"I presume, Sir," said Dillington, "you are
yourself a Benedick."</p>

<p>"Thank my lucky stars I am," said the
surgeon; "and am returning to a happy,
humble home, to carry with me to the sphere of

<!-- vol 2 page 295 -->

my duty as amiable a being as ever drew the
breath of life."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Dillington, "your absence
has given a new zest to your feelings, and if
you had not been separated from the lady, the
sameness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no," interrupted the surgeon; "rely
upon it, habitual attachments are always the
strongest and most permanent:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'True affection lasts the longer
    When its brightest hours are o'er;
Parting sorrows bind it stronger,
    Mem'ry but endears it more.'</p>

</div>

<p>I have been wretched during the year and a
half I have been absent, and have now, as I
was telling this gentleman before you joined
us,"&mdash;pointing at the same time to <i>me</i>,&mdash;"made
my health a plea for getting leave of absence
to surprise <i>her</i> with my arrival, and my resolution 
of taking her abroad with me; unless I
should eventually be able to exchange again
into some other regiment."</p>

<p>"I can easily conceive the delight of such a

<!-- vol 2 page 296 -->

meeting," said I. "In every man's life there
are a few moments of unqualified happiness&mdash;you, 
I suspect, are destined to enjoy such
to-day."</p>

<p>"Not to-day," said the surgeon, "for I have
to pass through town to my cottage, and must
report myself at the Horse Guards before I
start; but to-morrow by this time I shall again
be at home&mdash;and what a word is home!"</p>

<p>Dillington seemed much struck by the earnestness, 
almost amounting to enthusiasm, with
which our medical friend eulogized the "blissful 
state," and I began to think he would give
up the pursuit in which he was engaged, in
deference to the opinions and principles of the
surgeon. Lackington gazed with admiration
on the picture our friend painted of connubial
comfort and domestic happiness, and every
now and then I am sure his thoughts reverted
to his capricious widow, and that even <i>he</i> was
beginning to think he might as well rivet her
heart, by making her his wife, provided always,
of course, that she would accept his offer.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 297 -->

<p>The conversation which had taken place had
produced an increase of confidence amongst us,
and, voting ourselves a very pleasant party, we
agreed, after we had passed Kingston, to dine
together at some coffee-house in London&mdash;a
proposition to which Dillington most willingly
acceded, provided we dined early and near the
theatre. By this condition I ascertained that
his intentions as to the fair lady with the bright
eyes remained unaltered; and as I had no
responsible authority over his morality, I
suggested the Piazza Coffee-house as the most
suitable and convenient scene of action.
Nothing could be better for all parties; for
the surgeon was to sleep at the Hummums,
and Mr. Lackington at the Tavistock (corrupted 
by the market-people into Cabbage-stalk) 
hotel; and Dillington, who was to be set
down at the corner of Berkeley-street, would,
after dressing at his lodgings in Mount Street,
proceed to the coffee-house, the door of which
adjoined the door of the theatre, at which,
precisely at seven o'clock, in a hackney-coach,

<!-- vol 2 page 298 -->

the lady, or ladies, as the case might be, would
arrive in fulfilment of their appointment.</p>

<p>I undertook to order dinner and secure a
table&mdash;a proceeding which, in those times of
taverns and theatricals, was absolutely necessary; 
and having done both in the most judicious 
manner, I awaited the arrival of my new
acquaintance, who had agreed upon six punctually&mdash;Dillington, 
of course, not caring for
the shortness of the time allowed him to drink
to his fair one's health, nor hesitating a moment
between the allurements of Venus and the
attractions of Bacchus.</p>

<p>I thought while I was waiting for my company 
that I had been somewhat precipitate and
incautious in selecting so popular and populous
a place as the Piazza for the exhibition of myself 
in company with three persons of whom, in
fact, I knew nothing&mdash;of whom two, by their
own confessions, were professed libertines, and
the third of whom might not be what he professed 
himself: however, in those days, I generally 
acted upon the impulse of the moment,

<!-- vol 2 page 299 -->

and sought amusement without very particularly
investigating the source whence it was derivable. 
Nevertheless, upon this particular day, I
became, I scarcely know why, more scrupulous
than usual. I saw the coffee-room filling with
persons of consequence and character, who, in
those days, went to see plays and dine early in
the neighbourhood of the playhouses; and feeling 
that it might be disadvantageous, at my
time of life, to incur the responsibility of the
manners, conduct, and conversation of my new
friends, I called a waiter, and inquired if we
could have a private room to dine in, to which
he gave a most civil affirmative, and in less than
ten minutes I found myself snugly established
in the small dining-parlour which opens, or then
opened on the right hand of the door into the hall.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the clock struck six when the
trio appeared nearly together&mdash;Dillington,
dressed evidently to the best advantage, and
displaying unequivocal confidence in the tie of
his neckcloth and the curl of his whiskers;
Lackington in the deshabille of desponding

<!-- vol 2 page 300 -->

affection; and the surgeon, who was married
and settled, and whose heart-catching days were
over, in his morning costume, having only
refreshed himself at his hotel.</p>

<p>The luncheon at Guildford had considerably
damped our anxiety for dinner, which, however,
was put down and eaten, the wine passing
somewhat rapidly, in compliment to the expectant 
lover, who kept his eyes attentively on the
dial of the clock, in order that he might be
punctual to the moment; and Lackington exhibiting 
a good deal of feverish anxiety to tell
us something, which modesty, or delicacy, or
some doubt as to the prudence or propriety of
making further confidence with strangers, appeared 
to hinder him from imparting. At last,
however, after a few glasses of sherry, which
Dillington denounced for its resemblance to
lamp oil, and one or two of champagne, which
the same unquestionable authority proclaimed
to be indubitable gooseberry, he resolved upon
communicativeness.</p>

<p>As far as the affected airs of Dillington about

<!-- vol 2 page 301 -->

the wine and the cookery went, I cannot help
saying (<i>par parenth&egrave;se</i>) that they gave me no
very favourable opinion of either his taste or
character. The swaggerer is invariably an
impostor&mdash;the man who calls loudest for the
waiter, who treats him worst, and who finds
more fault than anybody else in the room,
where the company is mixed, will always turn
out to be the man of all others the least entitled,
either by rank or intelligence, to give himself
airs. People who are conscious of what is due
to themselves, never display irritability or impetuosity; 
their manners ensure civility,&mdash;their
own civility secures respect; but the blockhead
or the coxcomb, fully aware that something
more than ordinary is necessary to produce
an effect, is sure, whether in clubs or coffee-rooms, 
to be the most fastidious and captious
of the community, the most overbearing in
his manners towards his inferiors&mdash;the most
restless and irritable among his equals&mdash;the
most cringing and subservient before his superiors.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 302 -->

<p>Poor Mr. Lackington had not an atom of
swagger in his composition; he therefore drank
his sherry and champagne, and as his heart
warmed, his lips opened.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said he, "it must seem very
strange in <i>me</i> to fancy that my affairs can interest 
three gentlemen whom I never saw till
to-day; but as we have acted hitherto upon the
give and take principle of community in our
prospects and pursuits, I think I ought to tell
you, as a sequel to what I said on the journey, 
that I have received a letter from my
Fanny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" said I, "your bewitching and bewitched 
widow?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said Lackington; "and if you
really <i>do</i> care about the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, you will be
glad to hear that she is to be in town the day
after to-morrow, and expresses a wish to see
me, to be reconciled, and to cast into oblivion
all that has passed between us of a disagreeable
character."</p>

<p>"I rejoice," said I.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 303 -->

<p>"I echo your congratulation," said Dillington.</p>

<p>"And so do I," said the surgeon, "with this
proviso&mdash;that you marry her. Recollect my
advice in the earlier part of the day&mdash;the fact
that she desires a reconciliation, is a proof that
she is really attached to you. Put an end to all
these ungentle and unnecessary agitations of
temper and feeling&mdash;make her your wife."</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;indeed I would," said Lackington, 
with something like tears in his eyes&mdash;"but 
I cannot."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of the impediment?"
said the surgeon.</p>

<p>"That," said Lackington, "which you so
earnestly recommend&mdash;matrimony!"</p>

<p>"As how?" asked I.</p>

<p>"I am married already," said Lackington.</p>

<p>"Married, Sir!" said the surgeon; "married!&mdash;and 
yet&mdash;why, this is worse and worse.
<i>That</i> gentleman's libertinism"&mdash;pointing to Dillington&mdash;"shocked
me, but he is a single man,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 304 -->

<p>"I wish with all my heart, Sir, I had his
excuse," said Lackington; "but I <i>have</i> one for
what may seem gross impropriety and immorality. 
I will explain&mdash;my story is short but
really affecting."</p>

<p>Saying which, he "called up a look" which
he meant to be pathetic, but which, owing to
the peculiar formation of his features, and the
particular cast of his countenance, exceeded in
comicality anything I had ever seen, except
Liston when melancholic.</p>

<p>"It must be short," said the triumphant Dillington, 
"if <i>I</i> am to hear it; I have but twenty-two 
minutes and three seconds left."</p>

<p>"It will not occupy half that time," said
Lackington; "and I should like to justify
myself in Dr. Martingale's eyes for what must
appear extremely heartless conduct in roaming
and roving, having a wife of my own."</p>

<p>"I shall indeed be glad to listen," said Dr.
Martingale, such was our surgeon's name;
"for I have very decided opinions upon the
particular point of matrimonial obligations."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 305 -->

<p>"Well, then," said Lackington, "I will be as
brief as possible, and you shall know all. When
I was nineteen years old, which is now ten
years since, I did what a great many&mdash;indeed I
may say most young men do at that age&mdash;I fell
in love, and with such a girl as nobody ever
saw: her eyes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind her eyes," said Dillington,
"don't stop to particularize her points. I have
but nineteen minutes and a half, and if you go
into details I must run away."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lackington, "she was everything 
a man could desire in a wife; and, above
all, she was kind to me, reciprocated my feelings, 
and, after some few weeks of feverish
anxiety, I proposed, was accepted, but referred
to her father, who, without hearing me out,
ordered me out, and declared that his intentions
for his daughter were of a character wholly
incompatible with <i>my</i> means and situation, and
desired that I never would mention the subject
to her or himself again, and never make my
appearance at his house any more.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 306 -->

<p>"The consequence of this rebuff was," continued 
Lackington, "as you may suppose,&mdash;an
increased affection on our parts, and a determination, 
<i>co&ucirc;te qui co&ucirc;te</i>, to elope. A scheme was
planned, which would have been most effectually
carried into execution, if I had not, by some
misfortune or other, pounced into the old
General's room by mistake for his daughter's,
who was waiting, bundle in hand, with her mind
made up, and her maid beside her, all on tiptoe,
ready to bound down stairs to my post-chaise,
which was in waiting. The consequence was, a
discovery of the plot; a severe remonstrance to
my father from the General; and close confinement 
for six months to my gentle Adelgitha."</p>

<p>"Pass the wine," said Dillington. "A
thousand pardons. Let us call the waiter and
get the bill. Pray go on."</p>

<p>"My father," said Lackington, "entering
strongly into the General's feelings, sent me
abroad, where I remained, pursuing my studies,

<!-- vol 2 page 307 -->

for three years, which I admit I felt to be a
terrible waste of time."</p>

<p>Herein I tacitly agreed.</p>

<p>"At last," continued the unfortunate gentleman, 
"I returned home; and the first act of my
life was to discover whether my Adelgitha was
unmarried. I succeeded in ascertaining that
she was still Miss Rowbottom. I felt secure
of success, now that, I thought, all suspicion of
my intentions must be lulled, and convinced, by
her remaining single, that I was still dear to
her. Of course, my inquiries about her were
made with great caution and circumspection.
I had learned enough&mdash;I sought no more; but,
proceeding to the neighbourhood of her father's
house, soon contrived to convey a note to her,
couched it terms of unmitigated affection, and
conjuring her to let me know the state of her sentiments 
as regarded me. I received her answer:
her feelings towards me were the same as they
had been three years before, so were her cruel
father's. 'Circumstances which had occurred,'

<!-- vol 2 page 308 -->

she told me, 'as I must naturally suppose, had
rendered her life more unhappy, and her confinement 
more rigid; still, if I held in the mind
to rescue her from thraldom, she was prepared
to renew our plan, now of three years' standing.'
Her note ended by conjuring me to weigh well
what I was undertaking, as a diminution of my
affection would break her heart.</p>

<p>"Everything was arranged: two notes more
settled the business; and on the third night
after my arrival in the neighbourhood, I lifted
my gentle Adelgitha from the library window
of her father's house into my carriage. She was
so agitated at our meeting, and at the excitement 
of the whole affair, that she could not
stand, and I deposited her myself in the vehicle
which was to convey us to happiness <i>vi&acirc;</i> Dover,
whence we were to proceed to Boulogne to be
married&mdash;a scheme proposed by me to obviate
the necessary delay for residence, in order to
obtain a license; and as Adelgitha was out of
her nonage, I thought Gretna would be carrying
the joke a little too far,"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 309 -->

<p>"Despatch," said Dillington, whose eye was
as attentive to the dial as his ear to the dialogue.</p>

<p>"I will," said Lackington; "but I know
you'll laugh at me, although it is, indeed, no
laughing matter. As we proceeded on our
rapid journey towards the coast, I made ten
thousand inquiries as to the sufferings my dear
girl had undergone since my departure, and
received every assurance of affection and kindness 
from the dear object of my heart; but in
the midst of my anxieties and endearments, I
every now and then heard a knocking against
the bottom of the carriage, which, to a nervous
man, sounded very like a growing failure in the
axle-tree; but whenever I attempted to listen,
my dear Adelgitha diverted my attention from
the sound, by fresh professions of affection and
esteem.</p>

<p>" 'I scarcely expected, dear Frederick,' said
she, 'that you would have remained constant:
I thought perhaps the news of the dreadful
occurrence might have induced you to retract;

<!-- vol 2 page 310 -->

and that you might have considered it a perfect
justification of your withdrawal.'</p>

<p>" 'What accident?' said I. 'Tell me, my
beloved.'</p>

<p>" 'Don't you know, Frederick?' said my affectionate 
companion.</p>

<p>" 'Indeed I do not,' said I; and at that
moment I heard the same noise which had so
frequently attracted my attention, and interrupted 
her for a moment by asking her if she
did not hear the thumping, as I thought, of
the chariot on the perch.</p>

<p>" 'Oh, Frederick!' sobbed the agitated girl,
'that's <i>it</i>.'</p>

<p>" 'It!' said I; 'what, my angel? Do you
really know what it is?'</p>

<p>" 'Don't be alarmed, Frederick,' said Adelgitha. 
'I wish you had known it before.'</p>

<p>" 'Known what?' exclaimed I.</p>

<p>" 'Known <span class="smcap">it</span>, dearest,' said she, crying
afresh.</p>

<p>" 'What is the noise?' said I, 'and what has
it to do with our destinies?'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 311 -->

<p>" 'I feared it would have a serious effect
upon you,' replied Miss Rowbottom; 'but no!
your mind and feelings soar above it.'</p>

<p>" 'It!' cried I, impatiently; 'but what is it?&mdash;what 
does it mean?&mdash;what is the noise?'</p>

<p>" '<i>My</i> leg, Frederick,' said Adelgitha, dropping 
her lovely face upon my shoulder, which I
declare, upon my word, gentlemen, was as wet
through with her tears as if I had been caught
in a shower of rain."</p>

<p>" '<i>Your</i> leg, dearest!' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Yes; the result of that dreadful fall from
my horse, of which you were, of course, aware,'
said Adelgitha. 'The torture of amputation
was nothing, to the dread I felt lest it should
alter your affection for me; but I thought I
knew you better.'</p>

<p>"I thought, gentlemen," said Lackington,
"I should have died. I fancied perhaps she
was joking, or trying the strength of my affection; 
for I know what women will do in that
way sometimes. However, as it was quite dark,
and we were peculiarly situated, I ventured,

<!-- vol 2 page 312 -->

with the greatest delicacy and decorum imaginable, 
to ascertain the fact forthwith; and there,
sure enough, my hand lighted upon a stumpy
stick, of the Greenwich Hospital regulation cut,
and which, whenever my bride elect had become
at all animated or energetic, had been bumping
and knocking itself about against the bottom of
the chaise.</p>

<p>"I would have given the world to have
known of the accident, to which, up to that
moment, I was a perfect stranger. I should
I dare say, have, loved her the more for her
misfortunes; the loss of a limb in a man is
nothing; on the contrary, it constantly brings
to our hearts and minds the gratitude we owe
to those who fight our battles by sea and land;
and even though Miss Rowbottom might not
have claimed my sympathy upon that score, I
felt quite sure I should have overcome all the
foolish prejudices which a man has about the
symmetry of a sylph of seventeen, (which she
was when I last quitted her), in gratitude for
her attachment to me. But the surprise, the

<!-- vol 2 page 313 -->

suddenness of the thing, gentlemen, to find,
instead of the beautiful tapering ankle and
miniature foot I had left, no foot, no ankle,
no nothing, but a small black balustrade&mdash;I do
declare I was completely taken aback."</p>

<p>We could scarcely restrain our laughter at
this recital, which was delivered by our white-faced 
friend in the most plaintive tone of voice,
and in the most melancholy manner. Dillington
himself had not looked at the clock for three
minutes, and the hand was on the quarter; but
the tale was "wondrous moving."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "how did you proceed?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," said Lackington, "I withdrew
my hand, of whose presence the leg I had indeed
touched had not been conscious, and turned to
my weeping companion for some explanation
of the cause of this unfortunate substitution, to
which I was yet a stranger. Adelgitha gave a
long description of the terrible accident which
had produced the calamity with which I had
just been made acquainted, and I felt deeply
affected by the recital. However, gentlemen,

<!-- vol 2 page 314 -->

you will perhaps imagine my sensations, when
she wound up the history by telling me that
what I had now discovered was a trifle to what
I should see in the morning.</p>

<p>"What she meant, I could not, for the life
of me, comprehend; and I waited for daylight
with all the anxiety of a shipwrecked mariner,
but without any of his hopes.</p>

<p>"The excess of Adelgitha's agitation had
worn her out; and, some time after the conclusion 
of her narrative, she fell asleep, with her
head upon my shoulder, with her hand clasped
in mine. <i>I</i> could not sleep: I sat and watched
the coming dawn; till, at length, the first ray
of morning beamed through the glasses of the
carriage. I won't attempt, gentlemen, to describe 
the dreadful effects which the accident
had actually produced upon her once beautiful
countenance, nor the effects those effects produced 
upon <i>me:</i> nor will I endeavour to disguise
or describe my horror at the discovery. Here
was the daylight come; and I should have to
hand her out of the chariot, and into the packet;

<!-- vol 2 page 315 -->

and I should have to attend to her, and talk to
her, and at last to marry her, and to be her
constant companion for life. I could not refuse&mdash;I 
could not hurt her feelings, or practically
acknowledge the revulsion produced in my own
by any exhibition of disinclination to fulfil my
promise and redeem my pledge.</p>

<p>"The sun was quite up when she woke;
and opening&mdash;would I could say her eyes!&mdash;
for when one beamed upon me, I found the
other was gone. It looked at me as much
as to say, 'Well, what do you think of <i>this?</i>'&mdash;it 
did, upon my word, gentlemen; and I am
afraid I could not conceal my agony of mind
from Adelgitha herself. She, however appeared&mdash;as 
all women do&mdash;to bear the evil with resignation 
and good humour, seemingly careless as
to the effects it had produced upon herself,
and only valuing it with reference to that which
it might be supposed to have upon <i>me</i>, I could
not speak. What could I say? Could I tell
her that she looked as well with one eye as she
had done with two; or that a nose broken across

<!-- vol 2 page 316 -->

the bridge was more lovely than a delicate
aquiline? I could not say <i>that;</i> so I had recourse 
to the silent eloquence which is all-powerful 
in love, and caught her to my heart with a
sensation of affection and compassion. The
moment I did so, I heard the infernal bumping
at the bottom of the chaise again; it destroyed
all my sentimentality in a moment."</p>

<p>"Push on," said Dillington; "I have but
five minutes, and we have to pay the bill. Well,
tell us, what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Persuaded her," said Lackington, "to alight
at the next stage, and get some coffee, and take
half an hour's rest&mdash;a proposition to which she
readily acceded; and we were ushered into a
very comfortable room on the ground floor,
selected by the considerate waiter no doubt on
account of its more convenient position to a lady
under Adelgitha's particular circumstances.</p>

<p>"When she had retired with her maid, and
I was left alone, I began to consider what was
best to be done. I knew enough of the generosity 
and disinterestedness of female hearts to

<!-- vol 2 page 317 -->

believe that she would not think of holding me
to my bargain, if I candidly confessed how deeply
I felt the alteration which had taken place; but
how could I explain the sensations which occupied 
me, without wounding her almost to the
death? for what appeared very singular to me,
and which I believe is not singular at all, was,
that from habit, (the accident had happened
two years before), and that happy reconcilement
of our minds to what must be, and <i>is;</i> she
appeared to me, in spite of her lamentations,
practically to consider herself very much the
same as she was before the event happened;
for when she entered the room into which we
were first shown at the inn, she stumped up to
the looking-glass, and setting her curls in order,
exclaimed, 'How hideous this night travelling
makes one look!'</p>

<p>"I stared," continued Lackington, "but said
nothing; and when she returned from her half-hour's 
rest, I thought she fancied all my surprise
was over, and that I saw her now just as she
was when we parted. This mortified me: she

<!-- vol 2 page 318 -->

seemed to allow me no credit for my efforts to
be amiable and honourable; and I gave orders
for 'horses on,' resolved to impress upon her
mind during the next ten miles, in as delicate a
manner as possible, the real state of my heart.</p>

<p>"While we were waiting for the coming
steeds, a travelling carriage and four drove up
to the inn gate at a slapping pace. The noise
of the opening door and falling steps attracted
my eye, when, in an instant, who should appear
before us but General Rowbottom, and the
Major, his son&mdash;the father and brother of Mrs.
Lackington elect.</p>

<p>" 'So, Adelgitha,' said the General, bursting
into the room, 'we have caught you.'</p>

<p>"Adelgitha made no reply; her surviving
eye filled with tears, and she sank into her
brother's arms. As for myself, I felt I can
scarcely tell how. I am afraid I rather rejoiced
than not, that we were overtaken.</p>

<p>" 'Mr. Lackington,' said the General, turning
to me, 'what is the meaning of this rash and
foolish step? Three years ago I forbade you

<!-- vol 2 page 319 -->

my house. I believed your attachment to my
daughter was a pretence to possess yourself of
the fortune she then expected from her aunt,
Lady Swivelscombe, and I shut my door upon
you. You return three years afterwards, and
precipitately and unadvisedly enter into a clandestine 
correspondence with my child, and
eventually carry her off, in a state of health,
and under circumstances, which require the
greatest care and attention.'</p>

<p>" 'General,' said I, 'I admit the fact; but
allow me to be heard in my vindication.'</p>

<p>" 'Certainly, Sir,' said the General, calmly
and temperately.</p>

<p>" 'I admit the constancy, and sincerity, and
disinterestedness of my attachment to Miss
Rowbottom,' said I; 'I disclaim all care about
her fortune&mdash;I acted upon the impulse of a
long cherished feeling; but,' added I, with a
degree of diplomatic dexterity for which, perhaps, 
gentlemen, you may not give me credit,
'sooner than cause her a moment's unhappiness,
or the entailment of a parent's displeasure, I

<!-- vol 2 page 320 -->

am prepared this instant to give her up. Yes,
Sir,' said I, in what I considered a magnanimous 
tone of voice, '<i>I</i> can make sacrifices as
well as others.'</p>

<p>" 'Give her up!' said the General; 'by
Jove, Sir, you shall do no such thing. I and
Charles have followed you on your route in
order to stop your needless career. If you had
written to me&mdash;if Adelgitha had spoken one
word to me&mdash;now that you have proved yourself 
worthy of her, I should not have hesitated
for a moment to receive you into my house, and
welcome you as my son-in-law.'</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said I, amazed more I believe than
delighted, 'this is very strange!&mdash;this total
alteration of your sentiments towards me I
could not have been prepared for&mdash;I am but
what I was&mdash;I am as unworthy as ever.'</p>

<p>" 'Excuse me, my dear Lackington,' said
the General, 'your affection has been tested
not only by time, but by circumstances;
you proffered your suit when Adelgitha was
lovely, and you, I thought, were captivated by

<!-- vol 2 page 321 -->

her person, rather than her mind and qualities&mdash;you 
made your offer when she was the expectant 
heiress to a fortune of eighty thousand
pounds from Lady Swivelscombe&mdash;an accident
has marred her beauty yet you still pursue
her&mdash;Lady Swivelscombe's second marriage has
deprived her of the fortune she expected, and
yet you bind yourself to her for ever. What
can a father desire more of a son-in-law than
such convincing proofs of honour and affection?
Give me your hand, Lackington, and assure
yourself that you need go no farther on your
flying tour to matrimony; my house and my
heart alike are open to you both.'</p>

<p>"This was a finisher," said Lackington.</p>

<p>"You married her?" asked Dillington.</p>

<p>"I did," replied the other, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay," cried Dillington, interrupting him;
"the clock is striking seven&mdash;I cannot stop to
hear the rest&mdash;my sweet Maria is doubtless at
the door&mdash;let the waiter know what my share of
the bill is, and I will call and settle it, for I have
not a moment to lose. If my fair <i>incognita</i>

<!-- vol 2 page 322 -->

prove faithless, I shall be back in five minutes&mdash;if 
not, I trust we shall soon meet again."</p>

<p>Saying which, the impatient lover, having
shaken hands with us all, flew from our presence 
to keep his engagement, leaving the
doctor and myself to hear the termination of
Lackington's lament.</p>

<p>"Conclude, conclude," said Martingale;
"you married her, Sir; that is the point at
which to <i>me</i> the interest begins, for it is
thence I endeavour to trace the value of my
principles and opinions regarding matrimony."</p>

<p>"I did, Sir," said Lackington; "but in
the course of the negotiation (for our correspondence 
assumed that character), my father
and my friends so earnestly dissuaded me
from fulfilling an engagement into which I
had been what they called forced, that I
believe I must admit that I leant a little to
<i>their</i> way of thinking, and exhibited some
symptoms of a desire to withdraw. I found
it, however, impossible; both the General
and the Major had made up their minds to

<!-- vol 2 page 323 -->

the match, and I should have been tried by
military law if I had declined&mdash;and so&mdash;we
were united."</p>

<p>"And what," said I, "marred your domestic
happiness? I admit that the damages which
your lady had received might detract from her
personal attractions, but her mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, Sir," sighed Lackington, "that's <i>it</i>,
as Mrs. L. said of her leg. While she was beautiful, 
I never thought of her mind&mdash;while she
was beautiful, she never showed her temper&mdash;and
moreover, the fact that she was aware that I
would not have married her if I could possibly
have avoided it, set her so entirely against me,
that for two years she led me such a life as
compelled me, at the beginning of the third,
to seek a separation; but that&mdash;and I have
stated all the circumstances to show the fact&mdash;
that does not, as you know, enable me to marry
where I could really and fondly love."</p>

<p>"Have you any family, Sir?" said the doctor,
evidently collecting materials for some new
eulogy on the married state.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 324 -->

<p>"No, Sir," said Lackington, in a most lugubrious 
tone, "I have no progeny."</p>

<p>"I think," said Dr. Martingale, drawing
himself up into an imposing attitude, "you
have made out a case&mdash;the circumstances are
peculiar&mdash;very peculiar indeed&mdash;and yet I also
think if you were to make up your mind to it,
all might yet be well; the former exacerbation
of the lady's feelings might be soothed and
softened by renewed attentions and a fresh
show of kindness. There is, Mr. Lackington,"
continued the doctor, "and I never can repeat
it too often, a sweet community of interests&mdash;a 
binding reciprocity of feeling&mdash;a mutual confidence&mdash;existing 
in the married state which
no other can afford. I will instance myself and
Mrs. Martingale&mdash;"</p>

<p>How much farther the Doctor might have
proceeded in his eulogistic harangue upon
matrimony and Mrs. Martingale, I cannot pretend 
to say, for just at that moment a considerable 
scuffling was heard in the hall, and in
an instant the door of our room was hastily

<!-- vol 2 page 325 -->

opened by Dillington, who appeared before us
in a state of the highest excitement.</p>

<p>"Doctor, doctor," said he, addressing himself 
to Martingale, "your professional assistance 
is wanted&mdash;an accident has occurred&mdash;the 
lady I have spoken of, in stepping down
the infernal iron ladder of a hackney-coach,
has sprained her ankle, and is suffering so much
pain as to have fainted."</p>

<p>"Bring her in, bring her in," said the doctor,
rising from his seat.</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" said Lackington; "pray
attend to it&mdash;think what may be the consequence&mdash;that's 
it."</p>

<p>Accordingly we rose, and forthwith a delicate
young creature, in a half-fainting state, was
brought into the room, and by us, laid on the
tavern-regulation horse-hair sofa, which stood
opposite the fire-place. A thick veil covered
her face, but her figure was symmetrical.</p>

<p>"You had better leave the room," said the
doctor to us in an under tone: "she must lose
blood."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 326 -->

<p>"Not without one peep at her face," whispered 
I, as Dillington was entering.</p>

<p>"No," said Lackington, "one, one peep,
and we go."</p>

<p>The doctor, who was what is called a staid,
discreet personage, appeared somewhat unwilling 
to gratify our curiosity; I, therefore, who
was not quite so particular, effected our object
by twitching away the veil as if by accident,
and discovered a face fully corresponding in
beauty with the gracefulness of the figure.</p>

<p>Just as I had caught a glimpse of her beauties,
the doctor, who, after having assisted in depositing 
his new patient on the couch, had proceeded
to open, by the light of the candle on the chimney-piece, 
a shagreen case of lancets, directed
us, while he was adjusting his apparatus, to raise
her head. We accordingly did so; and judge
my horror, surprise, and astonishment, the instant 
after Dillington had addressed her as
"Maria, my love," to hear Lackington scream
out in a voice of horror, "What do I see? is it
possible? my fickle widow, by all that's diabolical!&mdash;Why, 

<!-- vol 2 page 327 -->

Fanny, Fanny!" Fanny was, or
seemed to be, insensible. But this was nothing
to what was coming&mdash;all that had yet happened
was thrown into the shade of utter darkness, by
the horrible shriek of the uxorious, confiding
and sentimental Dr. Martingale, who, the moment 
he set his eyes on the suffering angel,
dropped the lancet which he held in one hand,
and the candlestick and tape which were contained
in the other, and exclaiming, in a tone of grief,
terror, and amazement, which I never shall forget, 
"My <span class="smcap">wife</span>, by all that's devilish!" rushed
out of the room, and thence, out of the house
into the street.</p>

<p>Lackington, fearing some mischief either to
the doctor or himself, dashed out after him;
and Dillington, who saw that the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> had
somewhat prematurely arrived, ran after <i>him</i>,
and I found myself standing by the sofa on
which lay, quite unconscious of what was passing, 
the paragon of her sex&mdash;the amiable and
devoted lady of Frederick Olinthus Martingale,
Esq., M.D. and A.S.S.!</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 328 -->

<p>Under all the circumstances, however moving 
beauty in distress may be, I certainly had
no ambition to be the "Last of the Pentweazles;" 
and however much I might sympathise 
in the pain which she was probably
suffering from missing her footing on the steps
of the hackney-coach, it was evidently not the
first <i>faux-pas</i> she had made, and I thought the
sooner I got out of the mess the better. Depositing 
her Venusian head on one of the pillows
of the sofa, and gently kissing her cheek, in
order to deceive her into the belief that she was
under the care of one of the firm of Martingale,
Dillington, Lackington and Co., I stepped
quietly out of the room into the hall, and told
the waiter that strange things had occurred since
dinner, but that I would myself run round into
Russell-street and send in surgical assistance,
desiring him in the meantime to order one of
the female servants of the house to go to the
lady on the sofa.</p>

<p>"Directly, Sir," said the waiter; "only&mdash;I
beg your pardon, Sir&mdash;you'll excuse me&mdash;the

<!-- vol 2 page 329 -->

bill, Sir. Thomas," continued the man, never
losing sight of me or his hold of the door,
"send Sally to number one. The bill, Sir," at
the same moment producing from behind his
back a paper as long as the city streamer in my
Lord Mayor's show; "seven pounds eight
shillings and sixpence, Sir, besides the broken
candlestick."</p>

<p>"I," said I, "have nothing to do with the
bill beyond my own share of it; divide it,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Sir," said the waiter, "<i>you</i>
ordered the dinner&mdash;<i>you</i> engaged the room, Sir&mdash;we 
have the pleasure to know you as a
customer here&mdash;don't know any of the other
gentlemen, Sir&mdash;besides, consider, Sir&mdash;a very
unpleasant affair to have occurred in Mr. Hodgson's 
house."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, admitting the justice of the
waiter's claim, "of course, then, I will settle
it;" saying which, I suited the word to the
action by giving him a ten-pound note. "Pay
the bill and yourself, and with the rest see that the

<!-- vol 2 page 330 -->

unhappy lady is taken proper care of; and, unless 
her husband returns to claim her, let her be
removed to whatever place she chooses. I will
call here to-morrow, when you can give me an
account of your proceedings, and"&mdash;I added in
an under-tone&mdash;"let me know where she lives."</p>

<p>Saying which I quitted the Piazza Coffee-house, 
very much enlightened in my ideas of
the blessings of matrimony, and the advantage
of making stage-coach acquaintanceships.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I quitted the scene of action, I felt annoyed; 
not so much, perhaps, by what I had
seen and heard, as by the reflection, that I was
to re-commence my London life in a new place.
My servant&mdash;one of the best, for the first seven
years of his servitude, that ever lived&mdash;had proceeded, 
upon his arrival, to my old lodgings:
they were occupied by another tenant, but my
kind landlady recommended me to an excellent
house, where I should be as comfortable as possible; 
at all events, until the gentleman who
then was in possession of my former apartments
should be disposed to quit them.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

<p>I hated then, almost as much as I do now, a
change of domicile;&mdash;put me down once comfortably, 
and there let me rest. When I reached
my destined resting-place, I was disturbed, because 
the parlour of the house was to the right
of the door, instead of the left, as it was in my
other domicile; and then the staircase went up
the middle of the house, and my sitting-room
and bed-room did not communicate, and I had
to cross from one to the other in my dressing
gown, if I chose, as I invariably did, to breakfast 
in that "free and easy" vestment; and
when I was lighted to bed, by an elderly woman
in black&mdash;my man having retired to rest&mdash;I
thought she looked cross, and sour, and strange,
and not in the least the sort of woman by whom
I liked to be waited upon.</p>

<p>However, <i>faute de mieux</i>, I went to my bed,
but not to sleep; a thousand things flitted into
my mind. First, all the extraordinary developments 
of character, male and female, by
which I had been instructed and edified during
the preceding evening;&mdash;then, the affair of

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

Emma;&mdash;then, the <i>bouleversement</i> of my agreeable 
acquaintance with Mrs. Fletcher Green;&mdash;
and then the extraordinary termination of my
friendship with Daly, whose conduct, in spite of
the opinion of my friend, the gallant lieutenant
of Life Guards, had been, I thought, blameless in
the first instance, and generous in the last: and
so I concluded my reveries with a decision, that I
had been led into an affair, with regard to him,
which I could not but regret, and by a resolution, 
that of all earthly absurdities&mdash;not to speak
of its immorality&mdash;duelling was the greatest;
because the injured man is just as likely to be
shot as the man who has injured him. The
third possible case, of the injured man shooting
himself, I did not take into calculation.</p>

<p>I recollected, how strongly the greatest and
wisest of men had reprobated the custom. How
the King (Henry II.) of France, after witnessing, 
in great pomp, the celebrated duel between
Jarnac and Chasteneraye, at St. Germain en
Laye, in 1547, was so much struck by the barbarity 
and injustice of the system, that he put

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

an end to it. To be sure, his sons, Charles IX.
and Henry III. restored it; but they had not
been witnesses to, or, as I had been, a principal
in, a work of so much folly and injustice.</p>

<p>I believe my thoughts had taken this turn,
not only because I wished to put myself sufficiently 
in the wrong with myself, to justify my
seeking a reconciliation with my late antagonist,
but because I had very recently been reading in
the Isle of Wight, a speech of James I., delivered 
upon his first coming into the Star Chamber 
to sit, as judge, upon a case of duel, against
which he had issued a proclamation.</p>

<p>"Of all bloodshed," saith the king, "this of
the duel is the worst:&mdash;first, because it comes
not on revenge of other blood, which may stir
some compassion, as when a man had killed a
father or a brother, it was lawful, by the old
law, for the next of kin to kill the murderer, if
he were caught before he entered into the city
of refuge. But the duel is no revenge of former
blood, but a sharpening and whetting swords
to shed blood, and that, many times, for vain

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

words, which may be recalled. To revenge that
with blood which cannot be recalled, how vain
a thing is it! for a man, by God's permission,
may kill a man, but he cannot bring him to life
again. A man hastily falls out with another,
and so to the lie, and so to strokes, and so to
murder. This is yet more to be pitied, because
it is in heat; but, to do so in cold blood, as the
duel is performed, casts away all plea of mercy
before God and the king."</p>

<p>Much more did his Majesty propound to the
court, which I have forgotten, except, indeed,
his sneer at the degradation of the word honour, 
which his Majesty declared could only be
derived from the king, and was, therefore, inherent 
in no man. "Where," said the English Solomon,&mdash;and 
it is curious enough to quote at a time
when without, I trust, any serious diminution of
loyalty to the sovereign from that which the
country felt due to the kingly office in the days
of the Star Chamber, men certainly hold opinions
somewhat at variance with those of his sapient
Majesty,&mdash;"Where," says King James, "will

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

you have honour here amongst us, who live in a
monarchy, if not from the king? Men are bold
to give the title of honour where it is not due.
I have warned the marshals of it, that the title
of honour <i>shall not be given to gentlemen</i>&mdash;worship 
belongs to them, and not honour, which is
proper to statesmen and counsellors. For what
is the reason that a man, never so great in
honour, being attainted, loseth honour, but
because the king resumeth it&mdash;<i>Rex dat et aufert
honorem;</i> and he that grants honour, must interpret 
it. Will you, then, leave God and the
king, and the king and the state, the law and
the counsel, and get honour in an alehouse,
from a swordsman, that hath scarce a rag at his
back&mdash;a Barmoutho man!&mdash;one that dares not
go out of Milford-lane, for debt? If this be
honour, it is a ragged honour&mdash;a base, popular
honour; and, to say truth, popular honour is
but a treasonable honour in a monarchy. If
you will have such honour, you must go to
the low countries for it&mdash;here you may not
have it."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

<p>Poor King James!&mdash;little did he think, that
in two hundred years, or a little more, after his
death, titles and distinctions, of which he was so
jealous, would have been so scattered and tossed
about, that every Member of Parliament,&mdash;Barmoutho 
man or not,&mdash;would come to be designated 
as "honourable;"&mdash;that every alderman
would be dubbed worthy;&mdash;every officer pronounced 
gallant;&mdash;every barrister be styled
learned;&mdash;and every attorney called gentleman.</p>

<p>However, the principle of Solomon struck
deep into my mind; and, although the authorities 
of Doctor South, in all piety and seriousness, 
and Lord Chesterfield, in all the force
of ridicule, might have sufficiently satisfied
me, the <i>dictum</i> of an English monarch, delivered, 
too, in the Star Chamber, outweighed
them all.</p>

<p>As for his wise Majesty's disquisition upon the
difference between hot blood and cold blood, it
affected not me, because, as I have already
noted down, I never had the slightest intention of
hitting Daly,&mdash;a circumstance, which, however,

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

judging by what actually did occur, might, perhaps, 
have proved fatal to him. In fact, as I have
already said, my heart yearned for a reconciliation. 
I know what it is for a man to see a woman
the wife of another, whom he had, for many years,
intended to have been his own; but, as I argued
to myself, there is no accounting for tastes.
Emma preferred Daly, and, as she herself says,
never thought of me in the light of a lover; and
certain it is, that I was led to consider myself more
to blame in the affair than anybody else, since the
very next step of my life went to prove that I
could very easily mistake the candid good-nature
of friendship for an affection of a more serious
and tender character.</p>

<p>I admit, that such a disposition to misunderstand&mdash;or, 
rather, to misconstrue&mdash;might have
had its origin in conceit and vanity; but this
I know, that if women would but consider what
powerful, what dangerous, and,&mdash;speaking of
man's happiness or misery,&mdash;destructive weapons
eyes are, they might, perhaps, be a little more
careful in using them. Cardinal D'Este, in the

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

year 1505, is said to have caused the eyes of his
natural brother, Jules, to be put out, merely
because a young lady, to whom his eminence
was attached, happened one day to praise them.
Far be it from me to take such a course with
any of those bright orbs, which, if I have not
very much deceived myself, have in the course
of my life very much betrayed me. So much
for my conceit&mdash;so much for my repentance&mdash;and 
so much for my desire to be reconciled with
the Dalys.</p>

<p>Three&mdash;something more than three months,
had elapsed, since my last disappearance from
London, and November was setting in, with all
its <i>agr&eacute;mens</i> of yellow fogs, north-easterly
winds, and drizzling mists: the hypochondriacs
were getting ready their halters, and the demand 
for arsenic was considerable. After breakfast, 
however, I sallied forth, intending, in the
first place, to apply myself to Hull, who would
be sure to give me information about my generous 
friend. After having obtained this intelligence, 
I proposed continuing my walk as far as

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

Broad Street, where, I thought, if I did not find
a letter from Cuthbert, I should, at all events,
hear news of him; and, accordingly, I pursued
the track to Hull's chambers, to which he had
frequently invited me, and paddled through the
mud, with an umbrella over my head, fully prepared 
to resist the influence of the weather.
But such are the extraordinary occurrences of
this life, and such the curious coincidences,
which any man, who has a turn for observation
or remark, is sure to perceive, that I had not
dabbled along two streets from my new lodgings, 
before I saw the identical object of my
search,&mdash;Daly himself.</p>

<p>We were on opposite sides of the way. I
saw <i>him</i>, and saw that he saw <i>me</i>. The moment
was trying and critical;&mdash;would <i>he</i> break the
ice&mdash;should <i>I</i>? Our eyes met, and the doubt
seemed to be mutual&mdash;the inclination much the
same. It is quite impossible to describe the
sort of feeling by which we were both actuated.
I saw he wished to cross over and speak;&mdash;I
wished, (and thought he saw I did), to cross over

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

and speak to him. I cannot explain the affair
of the minute which followed; but, at the end
of it, we had shaken hands, and were walking
together.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Behold, his anger melts&mdash;he longs to love you,
To call you friend."</p>

</div>

<p>&mdash;I never felt more awkwardly in my life. It
was a question, whether I had better or not
recur to anything that had passed;&mdash;we <i>had been</i>
friends&mdash;we <i>were</i> friends. There <i>had</i> been a
sort of a hitch&mdash;a hiatus, but the fight had set
that to rights, and I had been wounded, which
was as much as a man of honour could expect,
and my friend had not wounded me, which
made the affair of reconciliation easier. But then
Emma&mdash;I could not screw my courage to "the
sticking place," as Shakspeare says,&mdash;I could
not ask after <i>her;</i> and Daly seemed&mdash;which was
odd enough for <i>him</i>&mdash;rather puzzled, whether
<i>he</i> should speak of her: so we said nothing for a
minute or two. At last, he asked me if I was
staying in town? Being November, I did not
like to commit myself altogether, so I said, I

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

had come to town the day before, and was going
away to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Deuced strange world this, Gurney," said
Daly, who began to recover his composure;
"you are a capital fellow&mdash;now be the best of
capital fellows&mdash;you know all my affairs by this
time. Have you a mind to come and dine with
me and Emma?&mdash;she'll be delighted to see you&mdash;so 
shall I."</p>

<p>I thought Daly showed the greatest possible
wisdom, in sinking all the intermediate events
which had occurred between our parting and
(literally) our meeting. His invitation was
what I really sought.</p>

<p>"I am your man," said I.</p>

<p>"At six," said Daly,&mdash;"nobody but my
wife."</p>

<p>"Where are you in town?" said I.</p>

<p>"In Duke Street, Manchester Square," said
Daly; "but you won't come?"</p>

<p>"Upon my honour I will," replied I, "provided 
you think that Mrs. Daly will not object
to receive me."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

<p>"On the contrary," said Daly, "she is
anxious to show you that her friendship is
unchanged, as ours, my dear fellow, I hope will
ever remain."</p>

<p>He again shook hands with me, in a manner to
convince me of the sincerity of his professions;
and having told me the number of his residence,
we parted, but to meet again at dinner time.</p>

<p>The moment Daly was out of sight, I felt,
although extremely happy at having achieved
my scheme of reconciliation, that I had committed 
myself to a scene of a particularly embarrassing 
character. I had called out Daly&mdash;for
all he knew, would have shot him, if I had not
by chance shot myself&mdash;I was then actually
bound in sureties to keep the peace towards him,
and we had been separated without any opportunity 
of explanation. That he, a man of the
world and of spirit, would think no more of this,
unless perhaps to applaud my anxiety to vindicate 
my honour, I felt quite sure; indeed the
manner in which he sought my hand the moment
our eyes met, and he felt satisfied that I should

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

reciprocate his sentiments, convinced me that
our difference was for ever at rest, and I left any
discussion which might arise in the course of the
evening to chance, because I saw how it would
terminate; but with respect to Emma I began to
get particularly nervous. He assured me of her
readiness&mdash;even anxiety, to receive me as a friend
in a new character, and with perfect cordiality.
But still, could she pardon my sanguinary proceedings 
as regarded her husband?&mdash;would <i>she</i>
too steep in oblivion all the past circumstances
of the case? these questions puzzled me, and all
I hoped was, that there might be some other
guests to break the solemnity of the party, or
that her mother and the major might be yet
living with them, to add to the hilarity of the
evening.</p>

<p>I pursued my walk into the city, having first
ascertained that my friend Hull was gone into
the north of England, where he had an estate
which he annually visited. At the agent's in
Broad Street, I found, as I had expected, a
letter from my brother Cuthbert, acknowledging 

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

mine, in which I had recounted the loss of
our excellent mother, and informing me that
his health was still declining, that the climate
decidedly disagreed with him, expressing apprehensions 
that he should be obliged to return to
England in a year or two, and begging me, in
pursuance of his former suggestions, to consider
the subject of coming out maturely and deliberately; 
not to risk my health or my happiness
by a voluntary expatriation, but if I could reconcile 
such a proceeding with my views of
comfort, and medical opinions were favourable
as to the effects of the change, he strongly recommended 
me to do so, as the opportunity
of fixing me in a highly respectable sphere of
society, and in a most lucrative business, could
only be made available while he was on the
spot, to delegate to me in case of the necessity
of his absence, that share of work and profit in
the concern, which I might eventually retain,
supposing he should at length find it necessary
to relinquish it altogether.</p>

<p>I read this letter attentively, and felt affectionately 

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

grateful for the solicitude Cuthbert
expressed for a brother, his interest in whom
could only arise from the most disinterested
feelings; and from Broad Street to the corner of
St. Paul's Church-yard, I continued firm in the
intention of starting immediately for eastern
climes. The resolution, however, was a good
deal shaken by the time I reached Charing-cross; 
and long before I got to the bottom of
St. James's Street, I had made up my mind
to do nothing hastily, but&mdash;which was always
then, and has been ever since, a very favourite
system with me,&mdash;to wait and see what would
turn up.</p>

<p>I cannot now comprehend the feeling of
reluctance to quit England, which at that time
so completely possessed me. It was a kind of
inverted nostalgia; and never did Swiss more
ardently desire to return to his native land
than I not to quit mine. I am not the least
ashamed of the feeling, as a national feeling, or
as an English feeling, for to this moment I
cannot, unless when health requires it, comprehend 

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

the taste which leads the great and
wealthy to abandon a country like our own;
quit the halls of their fathers and the cottages 
of their tenants; the air which they first
breathed, and the earth they first trod, for the
feverish and unsatisfactory life, which they invariably 
lead on the continent.</p>

<p>At the time of Cuthbert's offer the continent
was closed; the long war prevented the emigration 
which, after its conclusion, became so
fashionable. Paris, Vienna, Florence, Naples,
all were shut against me; so that although I
might have extremely well relished a tour for
the summer, it was not possible under existing
circumstances,&mdash;India was all that was left
for me; and although some of the English
magnets which once attracted me had lost their
power, Calcutta <i>did</i> seem a very long way from
Hyde Park Corner&mdash;or as the French general
spelled it, in addressing a letter to Apsley House,
"H&eacute;paquana,"&mdash;and at the turnpike which then
stood there, ended, in my mind, the habitable

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

world. I might perhaps,&mdash;so contradictory are
our natures,&mdash;had that same turnpike been authoritatively 
fixed as the boundary of my range,
have perished of a desire to go to Hammersmith,
as the old man who had never quitted Milan
during a life of eighty-four years, died of grief,
because, in order to try the effect, the grand
duke prohibited his departure from it.</p>

<p>Besides, I will not conceal the fact, there
were the dangers of the seas to encounter&mdash;dangers, 
which to a landsman, and especially one
of Cockayne, appear terrific. To a man who
in a stormy night, while the gusts are rattling
his windows, and howling down his chimney, has
read the adventures of Falconer, and Drury,
and Ashton, such prospects are not particularly
agreeable; not to speak of having dived into
David Chytreus, the Chronicler of Saxony, and
the history of the destruction of the Danish
Admiral and nine thousand men, in attempting
to get to anchor at Wisbo, during the war
between Denmark and Sweden, nor of having

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

read a list of calamities almost interminable,
recorded by Osorius in his history of Portugal,
including all the perils of Captain Capral, Captain 
Aquilaire, and Captain Sodre; and after
that, having been gratified with the following
ancient lines by way of moral to the melancholy 
tales:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">L'avare marchant
Les mers va cerchant,
Qui souvent lui font
De son avarice
Tr&egrave;s bonne justice,
L'abysmant au fond.</p>

</div>

<p>All these trifles combined, I must admit, did not
tend either to soothe my apprehensions, or excite 
my desire for so protracted an excursion; I
therefore determined, according to my ordinary
practice, to postpone the consideration of my
letter <i>till the next day</i>. Whoever has read Miss
Edgeworth's story of "To-morrow,"&mdash;and who
has not?&mdash;will perfectly comprehend the turn
of my mind, and then, perhaps, will be less

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

surprised at the way in which my life has been
spent.</p>

<p>One thing is to be done every day, however,
which cannot conveniently be deferred until the
next: I mean eating one's dinner; and therefore
it became necessary that I should take such steps
as might ensure my appearance at Daly's mansion 
at six o'clock. As the hour drew nigh, my
nervousness increased. I felt assured that nothing
like envy or uncharitableness would actuate
my mind as I ascended the stairs of his elegant
house; and that all the ideas I once entertained of
Emma's fortune being mine, were so completely
buried in oblivion, that I should rather rejoice
than not, in seeing their happiness, and that display 
of comfort and splendour, which her wealth
might justly and properly secure to herself and
the husband of her choice.</p>

<p>Still it <i>was</i> something to do, and I began,
when I began to dress, to wish I had postponed
it till "to-morrow." Yet I had been desirous of
the reconciliation with my friend; and since
Emma and he were now one, I could not be reconciled 

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

by halves; and so, as the proverb says&mdash;"In 
for a penny in for a pound," I began
dressing for the visit.</p>

<p>At six I desired my servant to do what I
supposed my friend Daly would, under his present 
circumstances have considered a most abominable 
action&mdash;call a hackney coach.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"He lisped in numbers, and the numbers came;"</p>

</div>

<p>and at about ten minutes after the clock of St.
George's, Hanover Square, had struck the hour,
I stepped into the litter,&mdash;I mean the litter at
the bottom of the "Jarvy,"&mdash;with a careful
regard to the prevention of the adhesion of
any of the straws to my black stockings; loose
trowsers, or even long pantaloons, being, at
that period, articles not considered fit to appear
in at dinner.</p>

<p>Right glad am I to observe that the ladies
patronesses of Almacks', the great marriage-bazaar 
of London, still adhere to their predilection 
for the decencies of dress; not but that

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

a foreigner, reading the implied denunciation of
trowsers and pantaloons, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>,
must be a good deal puzzled by finding inscribed 
upon the cards of admission to so high
and delicate an assembly, these most curious
words,&mdash;"No gentlemen admitted without
breeches and stockings."</p>

<p>Away we drove, at least my worthy Phaeton,
with my trusty squire at his side; but what with
the wet, and what with the fog, and what with the
hill up Wigmore Street, we did not make quite
so much way as I had hoped for. However,
my old friends Time and Patience served my
turn, and having entered Duke Street, the coach
stopped; my man got down and inquired, and
then confidently directed the coachman, who
accordingly drove up to a milliner's shop, a
little below Morin's Hotel and Coffee-house.
He what he called "rapped" at the door: upon
which I thrust my head out of the window, and
asked him in no very measured terms, what the
deuce he was at.</p>

<p>"This is the house, Sir," said Peter.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

<p>"This!" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," replied he, "this is number&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the door was opened by a
tall, fishy-eyed maid, with flaxen hair, and a
parchment skin, doubtfully displayed by the
light of a tallow candle, visibly affected by
the gusts of wind, which in November afternoons 
are in the habit of disporting about the
streets of London.</p>

<p>"This must be a mistake," said I.</p>

<p>"I'll ask," said Peter&mdash;and he did; and sure
enough the maid with the curls and the candle
was the domestic servant of my excellent friend
Bob Daly; and the door at which I had imagined 
he had "rapped" by mistake, was the
entrance to the blissful abode of that vivacious
creature and his amiable Emma. I was, I confess, 
somewhat surprised at the appearance of
Daly's residence and its accessories; but as I
always believe there are reasons for everything,
and was equally satisfied that it was no business
of mine to attempt to account for his mode of
living, I stepped out of my coach, shook the

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

straw from my stockings, and entered the passage,
which reminded me not a little of the story
so admirably told in Ireland's Illustrations of
Hogarth, of the two brothers who clubbed their
means to buy an elephant, and the sad fate
thereof.</p>

<p>"What name, Sir?" said the fair porteress.
"Gurney," said I&mdash;as what else should I
have said.</p>

<p>"What time shall I come for you, Sir?" said
Peter.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said I, feeling my position
difficult and critical, and not wishing by any
means to pledge myself to any particular duration 
of stay, but preferring to leave my sojourn
at Daly's, elastic,&mdash;to be contracted or extended
at pleasure.</p>

<p>I followed the broad-backed virgin up the ladder-like 
staircase, and was ushered into the very
neat but very small drawing-room, of evidently
a furnished lodging, with a long black pole over
the three slips of windows, and a deep drapery
pendant therefrom, with brass stars, from whose

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

centres darted rays of bright yellow calico,
looking</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"As doth the blushing, discontented sun,
From out the fiery portal of the East."</p>

</div>

<p>Black-backed chairs, with knobs to match the
stars, an abbreviated sofa, and before it a
table thereunto proportioned stood near the walls,
which were decorated with a circular mirror,
knobbed round, so like that which once belonged
to my "sainted Sire," in Bolsover-street, that I
almost loved it for its family likeness. The room
was filled with an atmosphere of mingled fog and
smoke, and the house generally pervaded with
the odour of roasted mutton.</p>

<p>After a few moments' delay, Daly came in,
and greeted me as I wished to be greeted&mdash;
I only trembled for the first meeting with
the lady&mdash;in she came&mdash;held out her hand,
and said, "Well, Mr. Gurney, how do <i>you</i>
do?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, I thank you," said I&mdash;and the
embarrassment was over; but&mdash;may I say so?&mdash;the 
disappointment had only begun. In spite of

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

all she had said upon the subject&mdash;or rather,
in spite of all I had heard from Daly&mdash;in
spite of everything in the world, I <i>did</i> believe
that our first interview after her marriage would
have been productive of some greater effect
than appeared when the event of our meeting
really occurred: a sigh&mdash;a blush&mdash;a tear, perhaps, 
or at the very least, a cold and trembling
hand; not a bit of it&mdash;the healthful colour of
her cheek fled not, neither did it increase;
her hand was as warm as it ought to be, and
did not shake at all; and her "Well, how do
<i>you</i> do, Mr. Gurney?" was pronounced in the
same tone, with the same ease, and with as
little embarrassment, as if we had met the day
before, or had never seen each other in the
whole course of our lives.</p>

<p>But what do you imagine was the next thing
she said?&mdash;nobody <i>could</i> guess.</p>

<p>"Mr. Daly," said she&mdash;Mister, too!&mdash;"how
abominably this room smokes."</p>

<p>"Dreadfully!" said Daly. "We had better
open one of the windows."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

<p>"What," said Emma, "and let in the fog&mdash;that 
would be vastly wise&mdash;a horrid hole you
find us in, Mr. Gurney."</p>

<p>I was puzzled what to say&mdash;I quite agreed
with my fair friend, but did not know whether
I ought to own it.</p>

<p>"I don't think it horrid at all," said Daly;
"however I chose it, and I suppose, my dear,
that is quite enough to set you against it.&mdash;I
hope, Gurney, you can eat mutton," added
Daly, turning to me, in hopes, I presume, of
turning the conversation.</p>

<p>I was about to say, that nothing on earth
is so good as mutton, when I was prevented by
the lady of the house, who, in a tone anything
but gentle, accompanied with a laugh, anything
but mirthful, exclaimed, "Whether he can eat
mutton I don't know, I am sure he can smell it."</p>

<p>"Well, my love," said Daly, "one cannot
help smelling dinner in a small house."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Daly," replied the lady.
"What clever creatures these wits are, ar'n't
they, Mr. Gurney?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

<p>"Well," said Daly, "never mind, so as we
get the dinner, for I am hungry."</p>

<p>"I am never hungry in London," said Mrs.
Daly.</p>

<p>The tone and spirit of the conversation
startled my ear more than the general appearance 
of everything around me, and I began
most heartily to repent me of having accepted
an invitation to witness what seemed to me very
like a representation of Catherine and Petruchio,
when the door opened, and the maid entered the
room with a small piece of paper in her hand,
which she delivered to her master, saying at the
same time, in a tone as little subdued as that of
her amiable mistress,</p>

<p>"The boy, Sir, is come from the tallow
chandler's, and says, if you please, he has a
large bill to pay to-morrow, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Daly; "why do you bring
up such things as these now?&mdash;don't you see
I am engaged&mdash;say I will call to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I told him that, Sir," said the girl, rather
angry at being snubbed before company; "but

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

the boy says that you said that three days ago,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come down and speak to him
myself," said Daly; and he quitted the room,
<i>grond&eacute;</i>-ing the girl at a severe rate.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Gurney," said the lady, when
her husband had left the room; "great change
since we met last. I suppose you thought me
a mad girl to run away. I assure you I think
so too, now, myself&mdash;pretty business, is'n't it."</p>

<p>There was an abruptness, and, as I felt, an
indelicacy, in Mrs. Daly's thus plunging <i>in
medias res</i>, and in half a dozen words giving the
history of what I felt to be her infidelity, of what
she proclaimed as her imprudence, and what she
now appeared to consider her repentance&mdash;I
was staggered.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, generally, "strange things <i>do</i>
happen."</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Emma, "I never expected
what <i>has</i> happened."</p>

<p>"No," said I&mdash;hoping every instant that
Daly would return.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

<p>"I hope Mrs. Haines is quite well."</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Emma, whose whole manner
and air, and even tone of voice, appeared to
me to be entirely changed by matrimony; "Mrs.
M'Guffin, you mean, I suppose?"</p>

<p>I hemmed assent.</p>

<p>"She is pretty well in health, but, as you
may suppose, not in particularly good spirits;&mdash;as 
soon as they can manage it, they will go to
Ireland&mdash;oh!&mdash;I forgot&mdash;you saw the Major
that day of the duel!"</p>

<p>I positively stared at my fair companion&mdash;I
could not comprehend whether the jumble of
conversation, involving all the most delicate
points to which Daly's good taste had specially
avoided a recurrence, arose from a sort of
callous indifference to events involving nothing
less than what I at one time considered <i>my</i>
earthly happiness, and probably <i>her</i> husband's
life, or from sheer innocence and simplicity.
If it were the latter, to be sure, she <i>did</i> dance
among the hot ploughshares, in a manner which
our once persecuted Queen would have envied,
could she have lived to see it.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

<p>How much farther my fair companion would
have gone, I do not pretend to guess&mdash;luckily
Daly, having despatched the tallow chandler's
boy, returned, anathematizing the stupidity of
Charlotte&mdash;such was the name of the huge wax
doll who had opened the door to me&mdash;for
pestering him with such absurd messages.</p>

<p>"Emma, love," said the Benedick; "have
you got the keys?"</p>

<p>Keys, thought I&mdash;Daly with a bunch of
keys&mdash;well!</p>

<p>"Not I," replied Emma; "I dare say you
have left them about somewhere&mdash;what do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I want to get out the wine," said Daly.</p>

<p>Get out the wine, thought I&mdash;picturing to
myself two foggy decanters, half full of the
remnants of yesterday's libation, with a sort of
furry rim just over the surface, of which the
expression gave me a strong idea.</p>

<p>"There's none out," replied the lady.</p>

<p>"Well then, I must get some," said the subdued 
husband.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

<p>"You might, I should think," said Emma,
"considering how long you have been in, have
done that before;&mdash;is'n't Robinson in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, love," said Daly, who seemed
to me to have totally lost the perception of the
ridiculous, for which he was so particularly
and pre-eminently famous, or if not, to have
acquired that peculiar sort of blindness which
sees no personal or family imperfections. <i>I</i>
never beheld anything more absurd than the
whole scene.</p>

<p>Away he went&mdash;and then left again, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, 
with the lady, I had&mdash;thanks to the convenient 
thinness of a pair of <i>battants</i>, about the
size of the doors of a moderately sized mahogany 
wardrobe, by which the back room was
separated from the front&mdash;the satisfaction of
hearing the creaking of a corkscrew, followed
by the pop-out of a cork, performed, no doubt,
by the dexterity of mine host, who, not more
than half a year before, used to give a capital
imitation of that self-same operation, which concluded 
by his stuffing his finger into his mouth

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

and pulling it out suddenly, with what he
facetiously, rather than elegantly, called a
"flop."</p>

<p>"Don't you think Mr. Daly altered?"</p>

<p>"No," said I; "much as usual."</p>

<p>"He has grown so slovenly," said his wife;
"and then he eats so much, and drinks so much&mdash;and 
he is so dull and stupid."</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "that he never can be."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Emma.</p>

<p>I felt I was treading upon mined ground&mdash;because 
I calculated that as we could hear my
excellent friend's performance upon the bottles
in the next room, even to the gurgling sound
of the wine as it underwent the process of transfusion 
from the green bottle to the decanter,
my excellent friend might with equal facility
hear the observations of his better-half, and
whatever rejoinder I might venture to put&mdash;so 
I hesitated&mdash;and hemmed&mdash;and looked, I
believe, something like what I meant.</p>

<p>Emma was quicker in her comprehension of
my thoughts and feelings than I had anticipated&mdash;she 

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

evidently read telegraphs with the greatest
facility, for having looked at me for an answer
to her last observation, or perhaps, for an observation 
in return, and finding none come,
she said, "Oh, <i>he</i> is gone down again."</p>

<p>Well, said I to myself&mdash;did I really think it
necessary to call out my excellent friend Daly for
depriving me of this perfect piece of excellence!
The blindness of a lover&mdash;for I once was hers
&mdash;became more evident than ever I expected
to admit. Yet, surely, something must have
changed her since we last met&mdash;changed her,
too, since Daly had written so enthusiastically
about her grace and elegance&mdash;<i>I</i> saw neither;
those eyes, on which I loved to gaze, roved
about, and rolled, in a manner most unpleasant, 
and the once sylph-like creature seemed
afflicted with a sort of nervous irritation which
prevented her from even sitting still in her
chair.</p>

<p>I heard a rattling of dishes and plates&mdash;the
back drawing-room was the dining-room&mdash;I
heard Daly superintending, and the great doll

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

whispering&mdash;a confused sound of "the butter
boat there,"&mdash;"mind, the macaroni at top,"&mdash;
and a sort of hustle-bustle kind of confusion,
in the midst of which Daly, who seemed to me
to be a sort of white Mungo in the establishment, 
came in, and throwing himself down in
a chair, which he had nearly broken by the
shock, exclaimed, "I wish they would let us
have dinner!"</p>

<p>This was a dreadful trial&mdash;having heard him
behind the scenes&mdash;as I should have said a year
or two before&mdash;getting the scenery and machinery 
in order, to see him swagger into the
stage box and cry, "When does the play
begin?" was rather too much; but if that was
a teaser, the look which Mrs. Daly gave me&mdash;who 
of course heard the dialogue between her
husband and the Dolly&mdash;was annihilation. Open
flew the folding doors.</p>

<p>"Dinner, Ma'am," said the attendant sylph.</p>

<p>"Come, Gurney," said Daly; "take Mrs.
Daly."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

<p>Take, thought I&mdash;considering it was a stride
of a yard and a half from the sofa where she
sat to the seat she was destined to occupy at
the dinner table, there seemed but little need
of <i>taking</i>&mdash;however, I did as I was directed, put
out my left arm pinion-wise, and for the first
time for several months felt the momentary
pressure of Mrs. Daly's right&mdash;she took her seat&mdash;I 
waited till Daly came, who&mdash;said grace!&mdash;and 
then the dinner was displayed to our
view.</p>

<p>"We can offer you but little in <i>this</i> way," said
Daly; "here are some mackerel&mdash;some mutton,
and, presently, some macaroni."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't expect any fine dinners
here," said Mrs. Daly; "do you, Mr. Gurney?"</p>

<p>I made a bow, and said nothing, but grinned.
I cared nothing about the dinner; but nevertheless, 
I felt it impossible to compliment it,
<i>quoad</i> banquet.</p>

<p>"The mackerel are stale," said Mrs. Daly.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

<p>"The mutton is raw!" exclaimed her husband.</p>

<p>"We are nicely served," said the lady&mdash;"Where 
is Robinson?" continued she, addressing 
the maid, and looking, as I thought, like a
fury.</p>

<p>The maid, who evidently felt that the reply
was not suited to the public ear, leant over her
mistress, and said, "Robinson will be in directly.
Ma'am; he was obliged to dress the old gentleman's 
hair, what lodges at No. 16, but the
moment he has done he will come."</p>

<p>This speech, though perfectly intelligible as
to its import, conveyed to my mind, as it
did to my fair hostess's ears, the fact that
the "gentleman usher daily waiter,"&mdash;whose
advent was so proclaimed, and whose appearance 
was so anxiously desired, was neither
more nor less than a hair-dresser of the neighbourhood, 
who enhanced his income by waiting
at the tables of those whose establishments were
deficient in males&mdash;<i>that</i> was clear&mdash;but the
evidence of this fact, and its unequivocal character 
only added to the mystification as to the

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

causes which could produce such effects, and
puzzled me beyond measure to comprehend
why Daly, who, when he had nothing, contrived 
to live like a gentleman&mdash;upon a small
scale&mdash;barring the "tripodial dinner"&mdash;should,
now that he actually possessed the <i>toison d'or</i>&mdash;have 
sunk so very much below his former
level.</p>

<p>I drank wine with Mrs. Daly&mdash;it was called
sherry&mdash;what it really was I have not the
smallest idea. Emma, the once gentle and
genteel, drank porter out of a pewter pot&mdash;I
wondered&mdash;I looked unintentionally towards
Daly&mdash;he seemed totally indifferent to her proceedings.</p>

<p>The mutton was, as it had been pronounced,
ill-done, and tough as leather&mdash;some high-smelling 
broccoli, and a few black-dotted potatoes, 
were the vegetables&mdash;the macaroni was the
climax&mdash;preparations in Dr. Gardner's window,
in Long Acre, would have been tempting by
comparison. I endeavoured to swallow eight
or ten inches of the "tobacco-pipes made

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

easy," and was getting comfortable&mdash;for what
are serious ills to others, are to me agreeable
varieties&mdash;when my plate was whisked away
in a gale redolent of pomatum. It had been
snatched from my presence by the hand of
Robinson, fresh from the head of the gentleman
at No. 16. However, I saw a gleam of satisfaction 
flit over the features of the once-placid
Emma when she found the barber at his post&mdash;a 
frown and a nod following, expelled the waxy-faced 
maid from the apartment, and Robinson
remained and officiated alone for the rest of the
dinner.</p>

<p>It would be tiresome, and even superfluous,
to set down the numerous snappings and snarlings 
which characterized the conversation of the
happy Dalys. One general rule appeared to
have been established in the family, which
might have been fairly called, as the old women
have it, "the rule of contraries;" for neither one
of the domestic pair said, stated, or even suggested 
anything which did not produce a direct
negative from the other.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

<p>"The room is very hot," said one.</p>

<p>"Hot!" said the other,&mdash;"<i>I</i> am miserably
cold."</p>

<p>"Clever man, that Mr. Wilson," says the
lady.</p>

<p>"The greatest bore in London," rejoins the
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Claret is the only wine fit to drink," declares 
the master of the house.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear the taste of claret," exclaims
the mistress.</p>

<p>"Dear me," cries the lady, "it is near nine
o'clock;&mdash;oh! I forgot&mdash;that clock is half an
hour too fast."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," says the gentleman, "it
is ten minutes too slow by the Horse Guards."</p>

<p>Whether the last contradiction was intended
to produce an effect, I cannot say. A consequence 
did certainly result from it, which I own
I did not so much regret as I once fancied I
should regret a separation from Emma Haines.
The lady declared she had no idea it was so
late, and rose to retire. That movement was

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

the first she had made, either mentally or bodily,
to which her loving spouse did not object. I,
of course, stood up, opened the door, and gave
her the <i>exitus</i>. Daly never moved; but the
moment the door was closed, drew his chair
close to the fire, and appeared resolved to
do, what sailors call, "making snug for the
night."</p>

<p>"Well," said Daly, as soon as I was seated
<i>vis &agrave; vis</i>, "strange things happen&mdash;don't they?"</p>

<p>I answered in the affirmative. Mrs. Daly had
made the very same observation to me, while
Daly was negotiating with the tallow-chandler,
and opening the wine before dinner. The remark 
appeared "somewhat musty," but, as
by a sort of unconscious sympathy, they both
<i>sported</i> it, I concluded that something <i>very
strange</i> had occurred, I waited for further enlightenment.</p>

<p>"You find Emma a good deal altered," said
Daly&mdash;<i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;at the same time pointing to
the folding-doors, which alone separated her from
us, in order to induce me to adopt the style <i>pianissimo</i>

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

in my reply. But what could I say in reply
to such a question? I did find her altered;&mdash;her 
manner, her look, the expression of her
countenance, the very tone of her voice, was
altered;&mdash;the milk of her kindness seemed
curdled&mdash;by what acidulating process I did
not know. All I did in answer, was to make
a sort of little, neutral, negative, affirmative
grunt, such as I have often before endeavoured 
to describe.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Daly, "you were a good
deal surprised to find us living here, and in this
manner?"</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "if you ask me, and wish me
to reply candidly, I <i>am</i> surprised&mdash;but, I must
also add, agreeably; for I have seen so many
instances of the mad precipitancy of spending
suddenly-acquired wealth, and so much misery
following a reckless waste of affluence and happiness, 
that I am more delighted than I can
express to you, at finding you going on in this
quiet way, rather reducing than increasing your
ordinary course of expenditure."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

<p>"My dear fellow," said my friend, "you know
me pretty well&mdash;do you think that I, Bob Daly,&mdash;the 
uncontrollable Bob,&mdash;who always proceeded, 
like Pat in the play, to</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">'Spend half-a-crown out of sixpence a day,'</p>

</div>

<p>should be here pent up&mdash;'cabined, cribbed,
confined,' in a first floor in Duke Street, Manchester 
Square, if I could be anywhere else?&mdash;Don't 
you know our history?&mdash;haven't you
heard, my dear fellow, we are stumped?"</p>

<p>"Stumped," said I, almost unconsciously repeating 
the quaint, but woefully-expressive
word.</p>

<p>"Positively stumped," said Daly;&mdash;"don't
speak loud&mdash;I thought, of course, you had heard
of it. Blinkinsop has bolted."</p>

<p>"Who is Blinkinsop?" said I.</p>

<p>"Who is Blinkinsop," echoed my friend,&mdash;"the 
greatest villain unhung&mdash;the solicitor of
<i>her</i> father;"&mdash;her with an emphasis, and an indicatorial 
point with the fore-finger of his right
hand towards the doors of the drawing-room;&mdash;"sole 

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

surviving trustee, and entire manager of
his affairs. Splendid fellow,&mdash;lived like a fighting 
cock;&mdash;balls, parties, <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, horses, carriages,
yachts, pictures, books, plate, etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera;&mdash;top of the tree&mdash;pleasant, placable,
popular. All went smooth;&mdash;the old lady was
enraptured with him&mdash;her jointure paid punctually, 
and whenever Emma expressed a wish&mdash;pecuniarily&mdash;Blinkinsop 
was too happy to meet
her wishes. In fact, the Blinkinsops were the
Lares and Penates of the Haines's."</p>

<p>"And did they receive the adulation ungratefully?" 
said I.</p>

<p>"My marriage," said Daly, "brought matters 
to a conclusion. Emma's portion was required;&mdash;then 
came delays and difficulties.
M'Guffin, whose object in marrying her mother
was as little equivocal as mine was known to
have been, was exceedingly active and anxious at
the crisis; and, as the family affection for the
trustee was not transferred, or transferable to the
Major, he pressed upon the worthy gentleman,
took advice of counsel, proceeded accordingly,

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

and the next week found the exemplary Blinkinsop 
on his way to the United States of
America,&mdash;having appropriated to his own uses,
and those of his interesting family, every farthing 
of the accumulated property of the late
highly respectable Joseph William Haines, Esq.,
father to the amiable and lovely wife of Robert
Fergusson Daly, Esq., your very humble servant 
to command."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "are you <i>obliged</i> to live
thus?"</p>

<p>"At present," said Daly; "but how long the
worthy landlady, and the industrious tradesmen
in the neighbourhood, will oblige us, by permitting 
us to live at all, I cannot pretend to guess.
We exist in hopes, that something like a dividend
will restore us&mdash;perhaps one and ninepence in
the pound out of the squandered property;&mdash;but 
till then, we vegetate after the fashion of the
chameleons."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" said I.</p>

<p>"It is, upon my life," said Daly. "I however 
lament it less from the actual loss and disappointment 

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

as to the money, than because the
misfortune has worked a total revolution in that
poor girl's character and disposition. She was
everything that you described, but the sudden
fall from affluence and comfort has completely
changed her:&mdash;her existence is one continued
fever&mdash;irritable, contradictory, restless, and jealous&mdash;nothing 
can be done to please, to soothe,
or gratify her."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "but surely she should not
make you suffer in happiness and comfort for
evils, in the production of which you could have
had neither share nor participation."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Daly; "it is now of no use
arguing with her upon that point, and I have
ceased anything like discussion; but the extraordinary 
feature of her transformation is, that
because our elopement and marriage produced
the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, or rather catastrophe, she considers 
it to have been the cause of her misfortunes&mdash;a 
conclusion founded upon false premises,&mdash;but 
from which I can neither lead nor
drive her."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

<p>"I admit," said I, "the alteration in her character 
is perceptible."</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said Daly, "like Sir
Peter, since she made me happy, I have been
the miserablest dog alive. I am conscious that
I have had no share whatever in creating those
ills which have overwhelmed her, and darkened
her prospects of happiness; but that, on the
contrary, even if the fact does not diminish her
burden, I am obliged to share her misfortunes,
and yet nothing I can say is right&mdash;nothing I
can do acceptable."</p>

<p>In the midst of this outpouring, a violent
knocking against the folding doors announced
the proximity of poor Daly's tyrant.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" cried he.</p>

<p>"Not at all well," replied the lady, opening
the doors; "it is past ten o'clock&mdash;do you
choose to have tea sent there, or are you coming
here?"</p>

<p>"In one moment we will be with you," said
Daly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Daly, "I am in no hurry

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

for your society. I thought, perhaps, Mr. Gurney 
would like his tea&mdash;he used to be very fond
of tea."</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how much a woman&mdash;even
a young and inexperienced woman&mdash;can say in
a few words, and how admirably she can convey
a meaning by her manner of saying them, with
which the words themselves have nothing in the
world to do. The tone in which the allusion to
<i>me</i> and my foregone partiality for the innocent
infusion of which she spoke, gave poor Daly to
understand, that in <i>those</i> times she <i>was</i> very
anxious to please me,&mdash;that she consulted my
taste, and even remembered, that very moment,
my likings and dislikings. All this I saw&mdash;and
saw that it was meant to vex him; while the
emphatic manner in which she spoke of what <i>I</i>
might like, proclaimed not only her solicitude
for my personal gratification, but her total carelessness 
as to her husband's society.</p>

<p>I could not choose but admire the amiable
docility of my friend, under the infliction of his
lady wife's sneers. Nor could I help calling to

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

mind the words Butler puts into the lady's
answer to Hudibras, as a justification of his
quiescence, and an illustration of Emma's severity:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Nor can the rigouresest course,
Prevail, unless to make us worse,
Who still, the harsher we are used,
Are farther off from being reduced,
And scorn to abate for any ills
The least punctilios of our wills.
Force does but whet us well t'apply;
Arts born with us for remedy;
Which all your politics, as yet,
Have ne'er been able to defeat;
For when you've tried all sorts of ways,
What fools we make of ye in plays;
While all the favours we afford,
Are but to girt you with the sword,
To fight our battles in our steads,
And have your brains beat out o' your heads."</p>

</div>

<p>I think, altogether, it was one of the most
unpleasant afternoons I ever passed&mdash;it did not
last long; for just as the clock struck eleven,
Mrs. Daly, having looked very pale, and rather
sleepy, for about half an hour, got up and lighted
one of two candles, which stood in two bed-chamber 
candlesticks, on a table in the drawing-room, 

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

and retired to her apartment, having shaken
hands with me, and given a look to her husband,
as much as to say, "don't let him stay long."&mdash;The 
truth is, that I felt no inclination to oppose
her wishes for my departure; however, when
she was gone, Daly, who, from the volatile,
gay, agreeable rattler of other days, had in the
course of a few months, aye, weeks, degenerated
into the most unhappy of hen-pecked husbands,
entered more at large into the causes of their
difficulties, which seemed to have arisen from
the villainy of the once-esteemed Blinkinsop,
who, in order to support himself and family
in splendour and extravagance, had, in his character 
of trustee, not only dissipated the ready
money of the deceased and deluded Mr. Haines,
which Daly told me had been squandered in
speculations on the stock exchange, and such
like commodities, but had mortgaged the estates
themselves, to an amount which exceeded their
real value, having, as it was generally supposed,
not satisfied himself with mortgaging them <i>only
once</i>.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

<p>In fact, such a combination of crime, fraud,
heartlessness, and deception, never had been
before exposed to the world, as this, when all
the particulars should be made known, was likely
to turn out.</p>

<p>Mrs. M'Guffin, and her Hibernian Major, I
found had taken their departure for the green
island, where the Major had some property&mdash;"a 
mighty pretty estate;" but Daly, whose
experience in the world had rendered him somewhat 
of an infidel in regard to Irish estates,
merely quoted the Major's own description,
brogue and all, at the same time giving me to
understand, that, except as far as the holy estate
of matrimony might benefit her, his exemplary
mother-in-law was not likely to get much by
the Major.</p>

<p>Our separation was very unlike any previous
parting; instead of the joyous smile, and the
hearty invitation to stop and pass a jovial hour
or two, Daly's countenance indicated worry
and depression of spirits, and his words were,
"Gurney, I am deuced glad we have met&mdash;there 

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

is no need of fine speeches&mdash;let me
hope, however, we shall continue friends through
life. I won't ask you to stop&mdash;but&mdash;come again
soon."</p>

<p>This I promised to do, and took my departure,
fully convinced of the accuracy of a description
of matrimony contained in one of the proverbs
in Ray's collection:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">        "The first month is smick -smack,
        The second is hither and thither,
        The third month is thwick-thwack,
            And the fourth,
The deuce take them that brought thou and me together."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I returned to my lodgings, I could not help
consoling&mdash;I believe I might almost say congratulating&mdash;myself 
upon the turn things had
taken with regard to Emma. As for the share
which Daly had in the transaction, I completely
forgave him. It seemed to me, from the turn
of Emma's mind&mdash;or perhaps because, not being
in love, I saw more clearly&mdash;that the difference
of result amounted to little more than existed
between Daly's running away with her before
we were married, or some other man's running
away with her after. Even if she had retained
the charms of person and temper, which I supposed 
she once really possessed, and by which I
had been attracted, I should in all probability 
have soothed my regrets upon the principle

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

of M. L'Abb&eacute; Regnier, who, in his Ode to
Acanthe, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">        "Pour m'assurer le seul bien
Que l'on doit estimer au monde,
Tout ce que je n'ai pas, je le corapte pour rien."</p>

</div>

<p>There was another, although certainly a
minor consolation, which I felt at the conclusion
of my visit&mdash;not a word had been said with
reference to Mrs. Fletcher Green, or my
strange blunder. Every moment I dreaded
lest some observation or remark should be made
by Daly, leading to that most tender and delicate 
subject; however, it seemed to me, that he
was totally eclipsed by the planet which had
stricken him; all old associations appeared to be
discarded; his interest in all the affairs of
society, deadened, if not destroyed; and he
himself a victim to a speculation, by which he
was to have triumphed. This was moral justice,
and yet I could not help pitying him.</p>

<p>As regarded myself personally, and my own
immediate pursuits, I remained for nearly six
months fancying myself making the most active

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

preparations for my voyage to India. During
this period, I am sure I visited at least eight or
nine different ships, some in the river, others
in the docks, some regular Indiamen, others
country ships, with every one of which I had
some fault to find. In one, the accommodation
was bad; in another, the passage-money was
too high; in a third, I did not like the manners
and appearance of the captain; a fourth did
not carry a surgeon, which, as I never had had
a day's illness in my life, was of course a
matter of primary consideration. So, however,
it went on; every trip I took for the purpose
of surveying the different craft, serving as a
business-like excuse for a quiet dinner with a
friend, at the Artichoke, at Blackwall, or the
never-to-be-forgotten Crown and Sceptre, at
Greenwich. Still I fully believed myself going,
and even went the length of making out an
inventory of a stock of sea-clothing, from a
shop-bill of Messrs. Favell and Bousfield, of
St. Mary-Axe, a neighbourhood still interesting
to me, as being the birth-place, and having been

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

in the days of his youth, the residence, of the
once-volatile Daly.</p>

<p>During a portion of the time, however, I
visited Brighton, which was then just becoming
popular as a winter watering-place; there I fell
into agreeable society, rendered more agreeable
still, by the fact, that in those days there were
no houses large enough to accommodate large
parties at dinner. The consequence was, that
our meetings were small and sociable, snug and
select. The old Steyne was then the very heart
of the place; a few scattered houses were to be
seen beyond the battery, on the west cliff; and
the crescent, which subsequently found itself
one day in the middle of the town, was an isolated 
colony in the east, equal in rurality and
seclusion to Rottendean itself.</p>

<p>It was during this period that, in the month of
February, I fell in with one of those illustrious
citizens, into whose society I had been unworthily 
admitted during my civic evolutions, and
whom I found established on what was then
considered a somewhat exposed part of the cliff,

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

near the end of Ship-street. He did me the
honour, not only to recognize me as having been
one of his visitors at the mansion house, but rather 
to hunt me out, or, I might say, hunt me
down, until at last he made up his mind to the
resolution of inviting me to dine with him and
his family.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gurney," said he, "I have the pleasure
to remember you in my mayoralty last year,
having been presented to me by my worthy
friend, Alderman Bucklesbury, and I am sure,
Mrs. Firkins has a strong feeling of your great
kindness to us, in coming in a friendly way to us
when we were at the Mansion House; perhaps
you will do us the favour to eat your mutton at
number nine to-morrow&mdash;we dine at five&mdash;it gets
dark about five now, and I see no use in wasting
one's time and appetite for a later hour."</p>

<p>I bowed assent, and felt extremely obliged by
the invitation, and accordingly was punctiliously
punctual. It blew what Mrs. Firkins called a
"harrico," and the shining bow windows of
Brighton houses in those days were not particularly 

<!-- vol 3 page 58 -->

well calculated to stand a gale; however,
we did remarkably well, and had a very pleasant
day until the ladies retired, when I found myself
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the alderman, who was evidently
bursting with a grievance.</p>

<p>The commonest tact in the world puts a man
<i>au fait</i> under such circumstances: he was actually 
boiling with indignation at something that
had occurred, and I felt quite assured, being the
only stranger present, that my bosom was destined 
to be the depository of his calamity the
moment the departure of the ladies permitted 
the exudation of his wretchedness. Sure
enough, no sooner had the door been closed
upon the charmers and cheerers of our party,
than Firkins, drawing his chair to the fire, and
motioning to me to do the same, began the
detail of his miseries; which, however, although
I noted it down as soon as I got home, was so
beautifully mingled with good feeling, that I
could not bring myself to smile at what in
particular parts might have been considered by
some fanciful persons absolutely ludicrous.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

<p>"Fill your glass, Mr. Gurney," said Alderman 
Firkins, "I want your advice&mdash;although I
<i>do</i> think I have made up my mind&mdash;still I know
my brother Alderman, Bucklesbury, has a very
high opinion of your judgment; and even if you
do not take upon you to give me counsel, there
is a pleasure in just, you know, telling one's
sorrows out of one's own family."</p>

<p>"Sorrows, Sir!" said I; "with such a family
as yours, with health and wealth, and all the
other enjoyments of this sublunary world, what
sorrows can you have?"</p>

<p>"A sort of proud sorrow," said Firkins, "of
which I am, and am not ashamed&mdash;will you listen
to me while I tell you my history. <i>You</i> drink
claret, <i>I</i> drink port; whenever you find yourself
or the narrative dry, help yourself&mdash;but I should
like to tell you, if I might, how I am placed."</p>

<p>"Nothing could give me greater pleasure,"
said I.&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't care about tea?" said Firkins.</p>

<p>"Never did!" said I.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Firkins, "we will just send

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

up to the women not to wait, which is I take to
be the genteelest possible way of telling them
to go to bed&mdash;don't you twig?"</p>

<p>"I do," said I, and bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>"That," said Firkins, "is what a gentleman
might call prime, without being thought vulgar."</p>

<p>I bowed again, not perhaps duly appreciating
my worthy friend's notion of "gentility."
Having rung the bell, and delivered his order,
the alderman resumed.</p>

<p>"What I want, Sir," continued mine host,
"is just a little patience, and you shall judge.
Now, fill your glass, and don't wait for me to
tell you to do so whenever it is empty."</p>

<p>"Your narrative shall not be broken in upon
by me," said I.</p>

<p>"You are right, Mr. Gurney," replied mine
host; "as you drink claret and I drink port,
we need not interfere with each other. You
know what the proverb says&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Jack Sprat, loved no fat,
    His wife she loved no lean,
And so, betwixt them both,
    They licked the platter clean.'</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

<p>We'll finish our bottles, I warrant, and all without 
any trouble whatsoever&mdash;so now listen
to me."&mdash;</p>

<p>I drew my chair close to the fire, and he
began,</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Gurney, I have been Sheriff&mdash;I 
<i>have been</i> Lord Mayor; and the three great
eras of my existence were the year of my shrievalty, 
the year of my mayoralty, and the present
year&mdash;which is the year after it. Until I had
passed through this ordeal, I had no conception
of the extremes of happiness and wretchedness,
to which the same human being may be carried.
Nor did I ever believe that society presented to
its members an eminence so exalted as that
which I once touched, or imagine a fall so great
as that which I have experienced*."</p>

<p class="small">[*It ought to be recollected, that Mr. Firkins made this remark 
at least five years before Buonaparte had been toppled
from his imperial mayoralty in France. It is right to mention
this, lest an imputation should rest upon the worthy Alderman,
either of ignorance of history, or a desire to elevate himself
above one of the most extraordinary adventurers the world
ever produced. <span class="smcap">Ed</span>.]</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

<p>I bowed, and sipped my wine.</p>

<p>"I came," continued the worthy Alderman,
"from that place to which persons of bad character 
are said to be sent; but which, if I know
anything of it, will every year, one after
another, raise its own character in the estimation 
of the country&mdash;Coventry, Sir; a place
proverbially genteel, Mr. Gurney, even in the
days of Sir John Falstaff, who would not be seen
marching through it with a ragged regiment,
Sir,&mdash;that was the place where I was born, and
my father, Sir, in that place many years&mdash;half 
a century, I believe, man and boy, 'prentice
and master&mdash;contributed his share to the success
of parliamentary candidates, the happiness of
new married couples, and even the gratification
of ambition, and wavering courtiers, by taking
an active part&mdash;not in politics, Sir, but in the
manufacture of ribands for election cockades, for
wedding favours; for cordons&mdash;as they call them&mdash;you 
know what I mean&mdash;the things they wear
over their shoulders with the Garter, Bath,
Thistle, and St. Patrick; but, Sir, in spite of

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

weddings, elections, and elevations, trade failed,
and my poor father failed too&mdash;he became bankrupt, 
but, unlike his betters, without any consequent 
advantage to himself; and I, at fifteen
years of age, was thrown upon the world, with
nothing but a good constitution, a very moderate
education, and fifteen shillings and eleven-pence
three farthings in my pocket."</p>

<p>The Alderman paused for breath, and I perfectly 
recollected the conversation which had
passed at Hull's cottage, with regard to his
social expedition with the friend of his bosom,
Bucklesbury, and thence deduced his desire to
set himself right with a man whom he believed
to be the favourite of that important personage:
the difference in their mode of travelling, and in
the results of their speculations, having been
most forcibly explained by my other worthy
and worshipful friend.</p>

<p>"With those qualifications," continued Firkins, 
"I started from my native town, intending
to make a pedestrian excursion; but my constitution 
not being so strong, or my feet not being so

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

hard as our worthy friend Bucklesbury's, I took
to the waggon, walking sometimes for recreation,
but sleeping comfortably under the tilt at nights,
and on the fourth evening reached the metropolis, 
thanks to the waggoner's moderation, with
no less a sum left in my pocket, than nine shillings 
and seven-pence."</p>

<p>I really delighted to hear of this progress
&mdash;it at once interested and edified me.</p>

<p>"The bells of one of the churches in the city
were merrily ringing as I descended the heights
of Islington; and were it not that Firkins never
could jingle into anything very harmonious, I
have no doubt that I, like my great predecessor, 
Whittington,&mdash;you have heard his story,
Mr. G.?"</p>

<p>I nodded, "Yes."</p>

<p>"I," continued Firkins, "might have heard
in that peal a prediction of my future dignity.&mdash;I 
did not&mdash;and wearied with my journey, took
up my lodging at a very humble house near
Smithfield, to which the waggoner recommended 
me with an assurance of good treatment. 

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

Well, Sir," said Firkins, "I don't want
to bore you with my own praises, or make
up a moral from my own history; neither shall
I dilate upon the good policy of honesty,
or the advantages of temperance and perseverance, 
by which I worked my way upwards,
until after meriting the confidence of an excellent 
master, I found myself enjoying it fully.
He took me into his house upon my poor father's
own recommendation; I served him faithfully;
he trusted me; and as I grew into knowledge I
did him good. I succeeded to his business at
his death, having several years before, with his
sanction, married a young and deserving woman
about my own age, of whose prudence and skill
in household matters I long had a daily experience. 
She was his only female servant, Mr.
Gurney, and while she was that, why of course
she had but few opportunities of showing
her intellectual qualities; but she had sound
good sense, Mr. Gurney; and when that woman
rose in the world, and felt the cheering warmth
of prosperity, her mind, Sir, like a balloon

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

rising into regions where the bright sun beams
on it, expanded, Sir,&mdash;dilated, Sir,&mdash;and she became, 
as, thank God, she remains, the kind,
unsophisticated partner of my pleasures and my
sorrows. Mr. Gurney, Mr. Gurney, that good,
excellent woman, humble as she was, has been
the friend of my life&mdash;the guiding star of my
destinies."</p>

<p>The Alderman grew eloquent in his praises;
but they came from the heart, and I felt delighted 
at his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Providence, Sir," continued the Alderman,
"blessed my efforts, and increased my means;&mdash;from 
a retail dabbler in dribblets, I became a
merchant&mdash;a wholesale trafficker&mdash;exactly like
our good friend Hull&mdash;in everything, from barrels 
of gunpowder down to a pickled herring.
In the civic acceptation of the word, I am a merchant;&mdash;amongst 
the vulgar, I am called a drysalter. 
I accumulated wealth;&mdash;with my fortune,
also grew my family, and one male Firkins,
and four female ditto, as you see,&mdash;or may see, if
you come to us as often as I wish,&mdash;grace my

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

board at least once in every week. I hold it an
article of faith to have a sirloin of beef upon my
table on Sunday, and when I am in London,
and within reach of them, all my children round
me to partake of it. Mr. Gurney, this may be
prejudice;&mdash;no matter, so long as the dear old
man could afford it, my poor father did the same
before me. I plead that precedent, Mr. Gurney,
and am not ashamed of the custom.</p>

<p>"Passing over all the little steps of my life&mdash;removals 
from one house to another&mdash;the enlargement 
of <i>this</i> warehouse, the rebuilding of
<i>that</i>&mdash;the anxiety of a canvass for common
councilman&mdash;activity in the company of which I
am a liveryman, inquests, and vestries, and
ward meetings, and all the other pleasing toils
to which an active citizen is subject, let me
come, Mr. Gurney, at once to the first marked
epoch of my life."</p>

<p>"If you please," said I, filling my glass again.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the Alderman, "the announcement 
of my nomination and election, as one of
the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, filled Mrs.

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

Firkins with delight; and when I took my
children to Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn
Fields, to look at the gay chariot brushing
up for me, I do honestly confess, that I did
feel proud and happy to be able to show my
dear little ones the arms of the city of London,&mdash;those 
of the Spectacle-makers' Company,&mdash;and
those of the Firkins's&mdash;recently found at a comparatively 
trifling expense,&mdash;all figuring upon
the same panels. I do assure <i>you</i>, Mr. Gurney, 
they looked magnificent upon the pea-green 
ground; and the wheels 'crimson picked
out white,' seemed so chaste, and the hammer-cloth, 
and the fringe, and the festoons, and the
Firkins' crest&mdash;'a Firkin, Or,'&mdash;as they call it,
did look so rich, and the silk linings, and the white
tassels, and the squabs, and the yellow cushions,
and the crimson carpet, looked so comfortable,
that, as I stood measuring it all, as it were, with
my eye, I said to myself, what have I done to
deserve it?&mdash;oh, that my dear father were alive
to see his poor boy Jack going down to Westminster 
in a carriage like this, to see sticks chopped 

<!-- vol 3 page 69 -->

and hob-nails counted. The children were
like mad things; and in the afternoon, when I
put on my first brown court suit, lined, like my
chariot, with white silk, and fitted up with cut
steel buttons&mdash;just to see the effect by candle-light, 
it all seemed like a dream. The sword,
which I tried on every night, for half an hour,
after I went up to bed, in order to practise
walking in it, was very inconvenient at first;
but use is second nature, and so by rehearsing,
as the players say, I made myself what I call
perfectly perfect before the auspicious day, when
sheriffs flourish and geese prevail&mdash;the twenty-ninth 
of September.</p>

<p>"The next twelve months passed very delightfully; 
for, independent of the <i>positive</i> honour 
with which I was invested, I had the
mayoralty in <i>prospect&ucirc;</i>, having attained my
aldermanic gown by a vast majority the preceding 
year; and as I used, during the sessions,
to sit in my box at the Old Bailey, with my bag
at my back, and my bunch of flowers on my
book, my thoughts were wholly directed to one

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

object of contemplation. Culprits stood trembling 
to hear the verdict of a jury;&mdash;convicts
knelt to receive the sentence of the judge;&mdash;but, 
Mr. Gurney, these things passed by me
like a breath of air, as I sat watching the Lord
Mayor seated in the centre of the bench, with
the sword of justice stuck up in a goblet, over
his head.&mdash;There, thought I, if I live three
years, shall <i>I</i> sit.</p>

<p>"Even as it was, I admit it was extremely
pleasant. I had to go to the House of Commons 
with a petition, and to court with an
address&mdash;trying situations for a Firkins. However, 
the courtesy of the Speaker, and the very
little notice taken of us by the members, put
me quite at ease at Westminster, and the urbanity 
of the monarch on his throne made me
equally comfortable at St. James's. Still, you
see, my dear Sir, I was but a secondary personage&mdash;or, 
rather, one of two personages&mdash;the
chief of bailiffs, and principal Jack Ketch.
There <i>was</i> a step to gain; and, as I often
mentioned in confidence to Mrs. F., I was sure

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

my heart would never be still until I was
perched upon the pinnacle.</p>

<p>"Time flies, Mr. Gurney," continued the
Alderman, "and at length the moment came.
Guildhall crowded to excess&mdash;the hustings
thronged&mdash;the names of the aldermen are read&mdash;cheers 
rend the air&mdash;the worshipful court
retire&mdash;they return&mdash;their choice is announced
to the people&mdash;it has fallen upon John Ebenezer
Firkins, Esq., citizen and Spectacle-maker&mdash;a
sudden shout is heard&mdash;'Firkins for ever!' resounds. 
The whole assembly vanishes from my
sight&mdash;I perceive nothing but a mighty moving
mass. I come forward&mdash;am invested with the chain&mdash;I 
bow&mdash;make a speech&mdash;tumble over the train
of the Recorder, and tread upon the tenderest of
the ten toes of Mr. Deputy Pod&mdash;leave the
Hall in ecstasy, and am driven home to Mrs.
Firkins, in a state of mind not to be described.</p>

<p>"From that moment, Sir, it appeared to me
that time flew no more; every day until the
eighth of November seemed to me as long as a
week. I existed in a state of perpetual nervousness, 

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

lest something,&mdash;what, I could not even
surmise,&mdash;should happen, to prevent the consummation 
of all my earthly hopes. At last the moment 
came in which it <i>did</i> seem certain that I
<i>should</i> be Lord Mayor of London, Sir, I was
sworn in&mdash;the civic insignia were delivered to me&mdash;I 
returned them to the proper officers&mdash;my
chaplain was near me&mdash;the esquires of my
household were behind me: the thing was done.
Never shall I forget the tingling sensation in my
ears, when I was first called 'My Lord.' I even
doubted if it were addressed to me, and hesitated 
to answer; but it <i>was</i> so. The reign of
splendour had begun; and, after going through
the usual ceremonies, and eating the accustomed
dinner, I got home, and retired to bed as early
as possible, in order to be fresh for the delightful
fatigues of the ensuing day.</p>

<p>"If I said I slept, Mr. Gurney," continued
Firkins, "I should tell a fib&mdash;how was it to be
expected? Some part of the night I was in
consultation with my dear Sarah, upon the different 
arrangements which were to be made;

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

settling about the girls&mdash;their places at the
dinner&mdash;their partners at the ball. The wind
whistling down the chimney sounded to my
ears like the shouts of the people; the cocks
crowing in the back yard, I took for trumpets
announcing my approach; and the ordinary, incidental 
noises about the house, I fancied the
pop-guns at Stangate, proclaiming my disembarkation 
at Westminster. Thus, Sir, I tossed
and tumbled, until the long-wished-for day
dawned; and as soon as the glimmering of light,
which at eight o'clock, in November, in London,
is not much, warned me of its arrival, I jumped
out of bed, anxious to realize the visions of the
night.</p>

<p>"I was not long a-washing: I seldom am.
I shaved as quick as I could, and proceeded to
dress; but just as I was settling myself comfortably 
into my beautiful brown broad-cloth inexpressibles, 
crack went something, and I discovered 
a seam ripped to the extent of half a foot.
Had it been consistent with the dignity of a
Lord Mayor to swear, I should, I really believe,

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

at that moment, have anathematized the offending 
tailor; as it was, what was to be done? I
heard trumpets in earnest&mdash;carriages drawing
up, and setting down&mdash;sheriffs and chaplain,
and train-bearer, and mace-bearer, and sword-bearer&mdash;Messrs. 
Mace, Sword, and Train,
water-bailiffs, remembrancers, Mr. Common
Hunt; Mr. Town Clerk, Mr. Deputy Town
Clerk, and Mr. Town-Crier, all bustling about,
the bells ringing, and <i>I</i> late, with a hole in my
inexpressibles. My conduct upon that occasion.
Sir, proved to me, more than any event which had
previously occurred in my life, the extraordinary
power of the human mind; nothing but promptitude 
and decision could have served me in so
trying a situation. The course to be pursued
came into my head as if by inspiration. I called
my wife's maid,&mdash;a kind, intelligent, civil, and
obliging creature, as ever drew breath&mdash;lives with
us still&mdash;I explained my misfortune&mdash;she came
to my assistance&mdash;and in less than ten minutes
her activity, wonderfully exerted in the midst of
the confusion, repaired the injury, and turned

<!-- vol 3 page 75 -->

me out, fit to be seen by the whole population
of the greatest city in the universe.</p>

<p>"When I was finally dressed, I tapped at
Mrs. Firkins's door, went in, and asked her if
she thought I should do. The dear soul, after
settling my point lace frill (which she had been
good enough to pick off her own shrievalty
petticoat on purpose), and putting my bag
straight, gave me the sweetest salute imaginable, 
at the same time saying, 'I wish your
Lordship health and happiness.'</p>

<p>" 'Sally,' said I, 'your Ladyship is an angel.'
On the landing-place were my dear daughters,
all in different stages of dressing for the procession. 
I kissed them all in turn, and descended
the stairs, to begin the auspicious day, on which
I reached the apex of my greatness. I never
shall forget the bows, the civilities, the congratulations, 
with which I was received as I
entered upon the scene of action. The sheriffs
bending before me&mdash;the recorder smiling&mdash;the
common sergeant at my feet: the pageant was
very delightful. And then, when all the necessary

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

preliminaries had been performed, I stepped
into that glazed and gilded house upon wheels,
called the state coach, and saw my sword-bearer
pop himself into one of the boots, with the
sword of <i>my</i> state in his hands, I was lost in
ecstasy. I threw myself back upon the seat of
the vehicle, with all possible dignity, but not
without damage; for, in my efforts at ease
and elegance, I snapped off the cut steel hilt
of my own rapier, by accidentally bumping
the whole weight of my body right, or rather
wrong, directly upon the top of it.</p>

<p>"But, Sir," continued Firkins, "what was a
sword-hilt and a bruise to me&mdash;pride knows no
pain&mdash;I felt none&mdash;I was <i>the</i> Lord Mayor, the
greatest man in the greatest city of the greatest
nation in the world. The people realized my
expectation; and 'Bravo! Firkins,' and 'Firkins 
for ever!' resounded again and again, as
we proceeded slowly and majestically towards
the river, through a fog which prevented our
being advantageously seen, and which got down
the throat of Mr. Sword, who was a little troubled 

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

with asthma, and who coughed incessantly
during our progress, much to my annoyance,
not to speak of the ungraceful movements,
which his convulsive barkings gave to the red
velvet scabbard of the honourable glaive, as it
stuck out of the coach window.</p>

<p>"We reached the water-side&mdash;we embarked
in <i>my</i> barge&mdash;a new scene of splendour awaited
me: guns, flags, banners, in short, everything that
taste and fancy could suggest, or a water-bailiff
provide were awaiting me. In the gilded bark
was a cold collation. I ate, or tried to eat, but I
tasted nothing. Fowls, pat&eacute;s, game, beef, ham&mdash;all 
had the same flavour; champagne, hock, and
Madeira, were all alike to me. 'Lord Mayor'
was all I saw, all I heard, all I swallowed;
everything was pervaded and absorbed by the
one captivating word; and the repeated appeals
to 'My Lordship' were sweeter than nectar.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," said the alderman, "at Westminster 
I was presented and received; and what
do you think I then did&mdash;I, John Ebenezer
Firkins, of Coventry? I&mdash;desired the Recorder

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

to invite the Judges to dine with me at the
Guildhall!&mdash;I, Mr. Gurney, who remember
when two of the oldest and most innocent of the
twelve, came the circuit, trembling at the very
sight of them, and believing them some extraordinary 
creatures, upon whom all the hair and
fur, that I saw, grew naturally; I&mdash;not only asked
these formidable beings to dine with me, but,
as if I thought it beneath my dignity to do so in
my own proper person, actually deputed a judge
of my own to do it for me. I never shall forget
their Lordships' bows in return; mandarins on
a mantel-piece are fools to them.</p>

<p>"Then the return, Sir. We re-embarked;
and then, in reality, did I hear the guns at
Stangate saluting me. I stood it like a man,
although I have always a fear of accidents from
the wadding. The tide was with us; we soon
reached Blackfriars' bridge; we landed once more
in the sphere of my greatness. At the corner
of Fleet-street was the Lady Mayoress, waiting
for the procession; there she was, Sally Firkins&mdash;my 
own Sally&mdash;(her maiden name, Mr.

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

Gurney, was Snob)&mdash;with a plume of feathers
that half filled the coach, and young Sally, and
Jenny, and Maria, all crammed in the front seat,
with their backs to <i>my</i> horses, which were pawing 
the mud, and snorting, and smoking like
steam engines, with nostrils like safety-valves;
not to speak of four of my footmen hanging behind 
the carriage, like bees in a swarm. There
had not been so much riband in my family since
my poor father's failure at Coventry; and yet,
Mr. Gurney, how often, over and over again,
although the poor old man had been dead
more than twenty years, did I during that
morning, in the midst of my splendour, think of
<i>him</i>, and wish to my heart that he could see me
in my greatness; even in the midst of my
triumph, I seemed to defer to my good, kind
parent&mdash;in heaven as I hope and trust&mdash;as if I
were anxious for <i>his</i> judgment, and <i>his</i> opinion,
as to how I should perform the manifold arduous
duties of the day."</p>

<p>I saw a tear standing in my friend's eye, as
these words came from his heart; and I said to

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

myself, this shall not be a bad man, let them
say what they may.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," continued he, after blowing his
nose sonorously, "up Ludgate-hill we went&mdash;the 
fog grew thicker and thicker&mdash;but then the
beautiful women at the windows,&mdash;those high up
could only just see my knees, and the paste
buckles in my shoes. This I regretted, but every
now and then I bowed condescendingly to the
people, in order to show my courtesy, and my
chain and collar, which I had discovered during
the morning shone the brighter for being shaken.
But else I maintained a proper dignity throughout
my progress; and, although I said an occasional
word or two to my chaplain, and smiled occasionally 
at Mr. Water-bailiff, I took no more
notice of Mr. Sword, and Mr. Mace, than I
should have taken of Gog and Magog.</p>

<p>"At length we reached Guildhall. As I
crossed that beautiful building, lighted brilliantly, 
and filled with splendidly dressed company, 
and heard the deafening shouts which
pealed through its roof as I entered it, I felt a

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

good deal flurried. I retired to a private room,
adjusted my dress, shook out my frill, rubbed
up my chain and collar, and prepared to receive
my guests. They came, and shall I ever forget
it? Dinner was announced; the bands played
"Oh! the roast beef of Old England;" onwards
we went; a prince of the blood&mdash;of the blood
royal of my own country&mdash;led out Sally&mdash;my
own Sally&mdash;the Lady Mayoress; the Lord
Chancellor handed out young Sally&mdash;I saw it
done&mdash;I thought I should have fainted; the
Prime minister took Maria; the Lord Privy
Seal gave his arm to Jenny; and Mrs. Snob,
my wife's mother&mdash;a wonderful woman at her
age, bating her corpulency, Mr. Gurney&mdash;was
escorted to table by the Right Honourable the
Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in his
full robes and collar of SS. Oh, if my poor
father could but have seen that!</p>

<p>"At the ball, my eldest girl danced with the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and found
him very chatty, though a bit of a 'swell;'
Maria danced with the Lord Privy Seal; and my

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

youngest with a very handsome man, who wore a
riband and star, but who he was, we none of us
could ever find out; no matter&mdash;never did I see
such a day, although it was but the first of three
hundred and sixty-five splendid visions.</p>

<p>"It would take till twelve o'clock at night,
Mr. Gurney," said Firkins, "to expatiate in
detail upon all the pleasures of this happy year,
thus auspiciously begun. Each month brought
its fresh pleasures; each week its new amusements; 
each day its festival. Public meetings,
under the sanction of the Right Honourable
the Lord Mayor; concerts and balls, under the
patronage of the Lady Mayoress. Then came
Easter, and its dinner&mdash;Blue-coat boys and buns;
then to St. Paul's one Sunday, and to some
other church another Sunday. And then came
summer; and then there was swan-hopping <i>up</i>
the river, and white-baiting <i>down</i> the river.
Crown and Sceptre below, navigation barge
above; music, flags, streamers, guns, and company. 
Turtle every day in the week; peas a
pound per pint, and grapes a guinea a pound;

<!-- vol 3 page 83 -->

not to speak of dabbling in rose-water, served
in gold, nor the loving cup, nor the esquires of
my household, all in full dress at my elbow.</p>

<p>"The days which before had seemed weeks,
were now turned to minutes; scarcely had I
swallowed my breakfast, when I was in the
justice-room; and before I had mittimused half
a dozen paupers for begging about the streets,
luncheon was ready; this hardly over, in comes
a despatch or a deputation; and so on, till
dinner, which was barely ended before supper
was announced. We all became delighted with
the Mansion-House. My girls grew graceful
by the new confidence their high station gave
them; Maria refused a good offer, because her
lover had an ugly name; and my dearest Sarah
was absolutely persecuted by a Sir Patrick
O'Donahoo, who had what is called the run of
the house, and who scarcely ever dined out of it
during my mayoralty, whether I was at home or
not. What did it matter? there was plenty to
eat and drink; the money must be spent, and
the victuals cooked; and so as we made ourselves 

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

happy, it was of no great consequence
having one or two more or less at table. We
got used to the place, the establishment had got
used to us; we became, in fact, easy in our
dignity, and happy in our state, when, oh! Mr.
Gurney, the ninth of another November came&mdash;the 
anniversary of my exaltation&mdash;the conclusion
of my reign.</p>

<p>"Again, Sir, did we go to Guildhall; again
were we toasted and addressed; again we were
handed in and led out; the girls again flirted
with cabinet ministers, and danced with ambassadors; 
and at two o'clock in the morning drove
home from the scene of gaiety, to our old residence 
in Budge-row, Walbrook. Never in this
world did pickled herrings and turpentine smell
so powerfully, as when we entered the house upon
that occasion; and although my wife and the
young ones stuck to the drinkables at Guildhall
as long as was decent, in order to keep up their
spirits, their natural feelings would have way,
and a sort of shuddering disgust seemed to fill
all their minds on their return home. The passage 

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

looked so narrow, the drawing-room looked
so small, the staircase was so dark, and the ceilings 
were so low. However, being tired, we all
slept well; at least I did; for I was in no humour
to talk; and the only topic I could think upon,
before I dropped off, was a calculation of the
amount of expenses which I had incurred during
the just-expired year of my magnificence.</p>

<p>"In the morning we assembled at breakfast;
a note which had arrived by the twopenny post,
lay on the table: it was addressed, 'Mrs.
Firkins, Budge-row, Walbrook.' The girls,
one after another, took it up, read the undignified 
superscription, and laid it down again. My
old and excellent friend, Bucklesbury, called to
inquire after us. What were his first words?
they <i>were</i> the first I had heard from a stranger
since my change: 'Well, Firkins, how are you,
old boy? done up, eh?'</p>

<p>"Firkins&mdash;old boy&mdash;no deference, no respect,
no 'My Lord, I hope your Lordship passed a
comfortable night; and how is her Ladyship,
and your Lordship's amiable daughters?' not a

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

bit of it&mdash;'How's Missis F. and the <i>gals?</i>"
There was nothing in this; it was quite natural&mdash;all 
as it <i>had</i> been&mdash;all as it must be&mdash;all as it
should be; but how very unlike what it <i>was</i>, only
one day before. The very servants themselves,
who, when amidst the strapping, state-fed, lace-loaded 
lacqueys of the Mansion-House (transferred, 
with the chairs and tables, from one Lord
Mayor to another), dared not speak, nor look,
nor say their lives were their own, strutted
about, and banged the doors, and talked of their
'Missis,' as if she had been an apple-woman.</p>

<p>"So much for domestic matters.&mdash;I went out&mdash;I 
was shoved about in Cheapside, in the most
remorseless manner, by the money-hunting
crowd; my right eye had the narrowest possible
escape of being poked out by the tray of a
brawny butcher boy, who, when I civilly remonstrated, 
turned round and said, 'Vy, I say,
who are you I vonder, as is so partiklar about
your <i>hye-sight?</i>' I felt an involuntary shudder.
'Who am I?&mdash;to-day,' thought I, 'I <i>am</i> John
Ebenezer Firkins&mdash;two days ago, I <i>was</i> Lord

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

Mayor of London;'&mdash;and so the rencontre ended,
evidently in favour of the butcher. It was,
however, too much for me. I admit the weakness; 
but the effect of contrast was too powerful&mdash;the 
change was too sudden&mdash;and here we are,
Mr. Gurney, as you see us."</p>

<p>"And right glad I am to see you," said I,
"in the enjoyment of health and happiness."</p>

<p>"We enjoy neither in reality," said Firkins;
"our mortifications have followed us here. My
wife and girls live in a sort of seclusion, and
do little else than sit at the windows, and sigh at
the sea. They cannot bear to go out; the indifference 
of their inferiors mortifies them, and the
familiarity of their equals disgusts them. Do
what I can with them, they feel themselves neglected, 
and cut, by people with whom they have
lived, for the last twelve months, as acquaintance. 
Why, there are now not less than four
men in this place, who call me Jack&mdash;plain
Jack, Mr. Gurney,&mdash;and that out of chaises or
in the libraries; and one chooses, by way of
making himself particularly agreeable, to address

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

me by the still more familiar appellation of
Jacky. Why, Sir, it is not more than three days
ago, that an overgrown tallow-chandler, who is
down here dipping his daughters, met us on the
Steyne, and stopped our party, to mention 'as
how he thought he owed me for two barrels of
coal tar, for doing over his pig-styes.' Sir, I
give you my word, when we first came, we drove
to the Castle Inn; in the passage, stood one of
his Majesty's ministers, speaking to his lady,&mdash;and 
<i>my</i> girls, Maria and Jane, passed as close to
him as I am to you; and although he had handed
one of them to dinner, and danced with another
at night, he appeared entirely to have forgotten
both, and took no more notice of them than if
they had been nobody at all."</p>

<p>"It is quite possible, in the innumerable engagements 
of a man in his station," said I,
"that his Lordship might really have forgotten
your daughter."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Firkins, who appeared
perfectly determined not to be consoled: "no&mdash;
the minute they were passed, he whispered

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

something to the lady, who immediately exclaimed, 
'No, you don't mean you ever did,'
and burst into an immoderate fit of laughter.
And see the consequence of all this:&mdash;Maria,
who danced with the Lord Privy Seal, and
was called an angel by the Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs,&mdash;who refused a good
match, because the man had an ugly name, is
going to be married to Lieutenant Stodge, on
the half-pay of the royal marines. Sir Patrick
O'Donahoo is gone to join the army in Spain,
and has left poor Jenny in despair; and, to
crown all, Sally is turning methodist. I cannot
help it, Mr. Gurney, but the females of my
family feel it so deeply, and that it infects me&mdash;and 
that's where it is. I admit my tumble was
unpleasant, but it has broken no bones. I have
toiled long, and laboured hard. I am conscious
of having done my duty, and Providence has
blessed my exertions; and what I say to the
girls is, that if the sudden change in our station
puts us out so much, they must lay the blame
upon me, for having aspired to honours above

<!-- vol 3 page 90 -->

our own sphere, which I knew were to be only
temporary. However, my ambition was not
dishonourable, nor did I disgrace the station
while I filled it;&mdash;besides which, Mr. Gurney,
after all, I <i>am</i> an alderman. That's the way I
argue; but they won't hear reason. For the
rest, Mr. Gurney, you are a man of the world,
and will, I am sure, make allowances for the
frailty of human nature."</p>

<p>So far from making allowances, I could not
but regard my friend, the alderman, with respect 
and almost affection. There seemed such
a perfect naturalness&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;about 
him; and as I knew his politics to be constitutional, 
and his principles unimpeachable, I
could not but wonder how he had contrived to
remain popular during his mayoralty, or have
escaped insults and outrages for doing his duty
honestly, fearlessly, and conscientiously.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Gurney," said Firkins,
"what would you advise me to do?"</p>

<p>"Advise you, Sir," said I, "why, if you
really mean to take counsel from me, I would

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

say, stay here as long as you like, and when you
choose to return home, go. A man, with <i>your</i>
heart and feelings, must ensure respect wherever
he is found. The friends who have always
esteemed you, will esteem you still. Think no
more of the fleeting gaiety, necessary to the
maintenance of a high office, but perfectly inconsistent 
with the quiet enjoyments of private
life; recollect, without soreness, that the great
men of whose coldness or forgetfulness your
family complain, paid their respects rather to
that office, which it is their duty, as well as interest, 
to uphold, than to the individual, of whom,
whatever might be their regard for his mercantile
character, they personally knew nothing but as
the chief magistrate of the city. The meanest,
basest, and most disreputable men, that ever
attained, by rotation, to the civic honours which
so well became <i>you</i>, have been equally complimented 
and caressed, according to the political
feelings of the Government of the time;&mdash;laugh
at all that. The public relations between you
and the government have ceased&mdash;forget it all.

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

With a family like yours, I would defy sorrow and
anxiety, and if your eldest daughter love Lieutenant 
Stodge, why let her marry him; and don't let
Jenny waste herself in despair for a runaway Irish
knight, or Sally die for love of an anonymous
youth in a star and riband. You have all the
materials for happiness in your hands;&mdash;use
them, my dear Sir, and believe this to be true,
that however fickle and evanescent the smiles of
rank and greatness may be, the fruits of goodness 
and virtue are permanent and lasting."</p>

<p>Firkins took me by the hand, and seemed
quite overpowered by his feelings. I could not
help marvelling to myself at the strange position
in which I had been placed&mdash;giving advice, at
my age, to an ex-chief magistrate of London,
who had passed the chair, and stood above the
Recorder. I did, however, what I thought was
right, and spoke the sincere feelings of my
heart. As usual with <i>me</i>, I found, at the conclusion 
of the narration, the candles short, and
the bottles empty. Resolved to show no undue 
preference in favour of the sherry and

<!-- vol 3 page 93 -->

Madeira, Firkins and I concluded by finishing
them off, and I took my departure, having obtained 
another strong and striking lesson upon
the peculiarities of our nature.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The reader having now been put in possession
of Mr. Gurney's report of Mr. Firkins' grievances,
as detailed by that worthy and never to be sufficiently 
lamented Alderman&mdash;(for, alas! he was
many years since gathered to his fathers)&mdash;the
editor of these memoirs, anxious to do justice to
Mr. Firkins's feelings, and to Mr. Gurney's
accuracy in recording them, considers that he
cannot do more for the establishment of the
sincerity of one party, and the correctness of the
other, than may be done by submitting a few extracts 
from an authentic work, published many
years subsequent to the period to which Mr.
Gurney refers, giving an account of the journey
of Lord Mayor Venables to Oxford, written and
published at the desire of his Lordship, and his

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

companions in that enterprise, by his Lordship's
chaplain. As the romance of real life is <i>said</i> to
be infinitely more romantic than that of fiction,
so the details of dignity, splendour, and magnificence, 
ably and carefully written by the Rev.
Gentleman, by which the expedition of Alderman
Venables was distinguished, very much transcend 
the description given by our respected acquaintance 
Firkins, to my much regretted friend,
Gurney. The extracts must be brief&mdash;but I
am convinced they will be highly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The first quotation I shall make from the
reverend author's book, is the description of the
departure of the Lord Mayor from the Mansion
House. It is headed "Tuesday," and begins at
page 11.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the 25th (July), the
Lord Mayor, <i>accompanied</i> by the Lady Mayoress,
and <i>attended</i> by the chaplain, left the Mansion
House soon after eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"The <i>private state</i> carriage" (I ought to observe, 
the <i>italics</i> are mine) "<i>had driven</i> to the door

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

at half-past seven." (which, by the way, as an act
of volition upon the part of the private state coach,
was extremely attentive) "The coachman's
<i>countenance was reserved and thoughtful;</i> indicating 
full consciousness of the test by which his
equestrian skill would this day be tried, in having
the undivided charge of <i>four high spirited and
stately horses, a circumstance somewhat unusual:</i>
for in the Lord Mayor's carriage, a postillion
usually <i>guides</i> the <i>first pair of horses</i>,"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the
postillion in the carriage guides the leaders,
which are the farthest removed from it.</p>

<p>"These fine animals," says the reverend
author, "were in admirable condition for the
journey&mdash;having been allowed a previous day of
unbroken rest; they were quite impatient of
delay, and chafed and champed <i>exceedingly</i>, on
the bits, by which their impetuosity was restrained."</p>

<p>"The <i>murmur of expectation</i> which had lasted
for more than half an hour amongst the crowd
who had gathered around the carriage, was at
length <i>hushed</i>, by&mdash;<i>the opening of the hall door</i>.

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

The Lord Mayor had been filling up this interval" 
(the door?) "with instructions to the
<i>femme de m&eacute;nage</i> and other household officers
who were to be left in residence, to attend
with their wonted fidelity and diligence to their
respective departments of service during his absence, 
and now appeared at the door. His Lordship 
was <i>accompanied</i> by the Lady Mayoress,
and <i>followed</i> by the chaplain.</p>

<p>"As soon as the female attendant of the Lady
Mayoress had taken her seat, dressed with <i>becoming</i> 
neatness, at the side of the <i>well-looking</i>
coachman, the carriage drove away: not, however, 
with that violent and extreme rapidity
which rather astounds than gratifies the beholders: 
but at that <i>steady and majestic</i> pace which is
always an indication of <span class="smcap">real greatness</span>."&mdash;p. 
12.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman describes this majestic 
progress through London to Cranford
Bridge; a powder mill at Hounslow is blown up
on the way; but at Cranford Bridge, "just
thirteen miles from London," the Lord Mayor

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

stayed only long enough to change horses&mdash;"for
his Lordship intending to travel post from Cranford 
Bridge to Oxford, his own <i>fine</i> horses were,
after a proper interval of rest, to return to town
under the coachman's care.</p>

<p>"These noble animals, however, seemed
scarcely to need the rest which their master's"&mdash;<i>job</i>&mdash;"kindness 
now allotted them, for
though they had drawn a somewhat heavy carriage 
a distance of <i>nearly seventeen miles</i>, yet
they appeared as <i>full of life</i> as ever; arching
their stately necks, and dashing in all directions
the white foam from their mouths, as if they
were displeased that they were to go no further."&mdash;p. 
16.</p>

<p>"Just as the carriage was about to drive away,"
(more volition) "Mr. Alderman Magnay, accompanied 
by his lady and daughter, arrived in
a post-chaise. After an interchange of salutations, 
the Lady Mayoress, observing that they
must be somewhat crowded in the chaise, invited 
Miss Magnay to take the fourth seat
which had yet been vacant in the carriage; <i>as

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

the day was beginning to be warm</i>, this <i>courteous</i>
offer of <i>her Ladyship</i> was readily accepted."</p>

<p>Here is a perfect justification of Firkins's
regrets at his fall,&mdash;the unhappy trio, jammed
in the <i>po chay</i>, had been the year before in
precisely the same elevated position which their
illustrious friends then occupied; and if the courteous 
Lady Mayoress the year before that, had
been screwed up with her husband and daughter
in a <i>po chay</i> also, then Mrs. Magnay would have
been the courteous Lady Mayoress, to have
relieved the Venableses. I must, however, think
that the reverend gentleman's reason for Miss
Magnay's ready acceptance of the courteous
offer, does her an injustice. By his account,
she readily got out of the family jam, not because 
she duly appreciated the grace and favour
of the Lady Mayoress, but because "the day
was beginning to be warm."</p>

<p>The journey to Oxford was all safely completed, 
and after seventy-six pages of matter,
equally illustrative of Firkins's feelings, we come
at p. 77, to this description of the rapture and

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

delight of the people of Oxfordshire, under the
exciting circumstances of the Lord Mayor's return 
down the river towards London.</p>

<p>"The crowds of people&mdash;men, women, and
children, who had accompanied the barge from
Oxford, were continually <i>succeeded</i> by fresh <i>reinforcements</i> 
from every town and village that is
skirted by the river. Distant shouts and acclamations 
perpetually re-echoed from field to field,
as the various rustic parties with their fresh and
blooming faces, were seen hurrying forth from
their cottages and gardens; climbing trees, struggling 
through copses, and traversing thickets, to
make their shortest way to the water side.
<i>Handfuls of halfpence were scattered</i> to the
children as they kept pace with the city barge,
and Mr. Alderman Atkins, who assisted the Lord
Mayor in the distribution, seemed to enter with
more than common pleasure into the enjoyment
of the little children. It was gratifying to <i>see
the absence</i> of selfish feeling manifested by
some of the elder boys, who, forgetful of themselves, 

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

collected for the younger girls."&mdash;pp. 77,
78.</p>

<p>The last bit for which I have room, is of the
more convincing and powerfully descriptive cast,
than any thing I have yet advanced in favour of
my poor friend Gurney's estimation of Firkins's
dismay at his fall. The scene is near Caversham, 
where crowds of "spectators, some on
foot, some on horseback, and <i>some</i> in equipages
of <i>every</i> kind" were collected to see the barges
pass.</p>

<p>"Among the equestrians," says the author,
"two are deserving that their looks and equipments 
should be alluded to in more than general 
terms. The animals they bestrode, were a
couple of broken down ponies, gaunt and rusty,
who had possibly once seen better days. The
men themselves were not unsuitable figures to
such a pair of steeds. They rode with short
stirrups, that brought their knees almost under
cover of the shaggy manes that overspread the
ewe necks of the poor creatures; and carried

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

their short thick sticks <i>perpendicular in their
hands</i>."</p>

<p>This sounds like an account in one of the
innumerable books of travels in the interior of
Africa, rather than a description of a couple of
natives of Berkshire, within five-and-thirty miles
of Hyde Park Corner; however, "so mightily
pleased was the Lord Mayor with their uncouth
and ludicrous appearance, that he <i>hailed</i> one of
them, and asked him to be the bearer of a message 
to Reading, <i>touching his Lordship's carriage. 
The fellow seemed to feel as he never felt
before. An honour was about to be conferred
upon him alone</i>, to be the <i>avant courier</i> of&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Lord Mayor of London</span>, above and beyond
all the other riders, drivers, and walkers, of
whatever quality and degree, who had thronged
in view of the civic party; and no sooner had
his Lordship flung him a piece of money, and
told him to 'make haste to the Bear Inn at
Reading, and order the Lord Mayor's carriage
to meet the barge at Caversham Bridge,' than
the fellow instantly belaboured the starveling

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

ribs of the poor animal that carried him with
kicks and cudgel, <i>who</i> in a moment dashed
briskly forward, snuffling and snorting, across
the fields. In the eagerness of his flight, the
doughty messenger had much ado to keep his
seat; he sometimes slipped on one side of the
saddle, and sometimes on the other, while the
skirts of his unbuttoned coat fluttered far out
behind him."&mdash;pp. 81, 82.</p>

<p>All this evidence from the pen of a worthy
divine, will, I am sure, convince the most sceptical 
reader of the fidelity with which my late
friend repeated the regrets and lamentations of
our friends in Budge Row, after their involuntary 
abdication. Every page of the account
of that memorable journey and voyage teems
with gem-like illustrations of a similar character; 
and I regret that my duty, as editor
of the Gurney papers, does not permit me to
draw more largely on its stores, even at the
risk of keeping the reader longer from matters 
more particularly connected with the subjects 
before us.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

<p>Having now so far intruded, I resume the
narrative.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At Brighton I continued still wavering, until,
having returned to London&mdash;it was already the
beginning of April&mdash;not the first&mdash;when I received 
the following letter from Cuthbert.</p>

<br/>

<p class="right"><i>Calcutta, Nov.</i> 5, 18&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother Gilbert</span>,</p>

<p>"I have been anxiously watching the arrival
of every ship from England, in hope of finding 
you reported as a passenger; an anxiety
which was in no small degree augmented, first
by your expressed resolution to come to me,
and latterly by your silence. I should be extremely 
happy if it suited your inclinations to
join me in my business, having now the whole
and sole control of the concern.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nubley, who takes charge of this, and
will forward it to you, has been, as you may
recollect to have heard, settled in India for

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

upwards of thirty years. He was the second
partner in our house when I first entered it.
He has now retired from business, to his native
country, with a fortune of upwards of one hundred 
and twenty thousand pounds. This I
mention, in order that you may duly appreciate
the offer which waits your acceptance.</p>

<p>"If you choose to come out, I will strain every
effort to remain here, in order to place you
precisely in the situation, relatively to myself, in
which I have stood for the last nine years to Mr.
Nubley; but unwilling as I may be, as it must
be clear I am, to quit India altogether, I fear I
shall be soon compelled to do so, on account of my
health; and, in that case, the advantages which I
contemplate for you, will be reaped by others, for
whom I have no stronger feeling of regard than
that which binds us together as fellow-men.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nubley has promised me to give you an
insight into the nature of our traffic here, and to
point out, should you not have started before
his arrival in England, certain acquirements,
which will greatly facilitate your success, and of

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

which, during the voyage out, you can make
yourself master.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of your habits, except what
I could collect from our dear mother's letters;
but I feel pretty sure, that as you grow older,
habits of regularity and business will become
confirmed in you, and that in a very few years
you will, like my worthy friend, of whom I have
just spoken, return to England, a happy and
wealthy man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nubley is an excellent gentleman. He
is somewhat absent in mind, and has a custom, 
for which it is as well perhaps to prepare
you, of thinking aloud; if you were not put
upon your guard as to this little peculiarity,
you might be apt to take offence at some of
his observations: they are meant for himself,
although he unconsciously gives them utterance;
and I believe, if everybody in the world had the
same complaint (if it may be called one), people
would cease to be so conceited of their own
virtues and perfections as they are at present.</p>

<p>"Theophrastus says, at least I think so: Absence of 

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

mind may be defined to be a slowness
of mind, in speaking or in action. The absent
man is one, who when he is reckoning up a bill,
and hath collected the particulars, will ask a
by-stander what the amount is. When he is
engaged in a law-suit, and the day of trial
comes, he forgets it, and goes into the country.
He goes to the theatre to see the play, and is
left behind, asleep upon the benches. He takes
any article, and puts it away securely; then he
begins to look for it, and is never able to find it.
If a man comes and tells him of the death of a
friend, and asks him to the funeral, he says, with
a melancholy countenance, and tears in his
eyes, 'What uncommon good luck!' When
he receives money, he calls men to witness the
transaction; when he pays a debt, he does not.
He quarrels with his servant for not bringing him
cucumbers in winter; and forces his children to
run and wrestle for their health, till they are
ready to die of fatigue. When in the country,
he dresses his dinner of herbs, he salts them
until they are unfit to eat. And, if anybody

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

ask him, 'How many dead have been carried
through the sacred gate, to be buried?' he
answers, 'I wish to my heart you and I had
half as many.'</p>

<p>"Whether this learned piece of fuller's earth
(who, at a hundred and seven years of age, cried
out against the injustice of nature, in giving
crows longer lives than men) anticipated that
such a being as my late excellent master, and
more recent partner, Nubley, was really to be
born, I do not pretend to say; but certain it is,
that his hypothetical description is the very portraiture 
of the man; and this I say, because I
feel it to be right to prepare you for his oddities.
He is the worthiest of created men, as I am
sure you will find; and if you are not on your
voyage hither before his arrival, cultivate his
acquaintance, as I know he will afford you the
opportunity of doing, and take his advice&mdash;above 
all, upon the point of your emigration.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Nubley was a venture girl from England, 
and a beauty, but she was exported nearly
thirty years ago. Neither the lapse of time,

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

nor, which seems more extraordinary still, her
looking-glass, appearing to have whispered in
her ear&mdash;to be sure she <i>is</i> a little deaf&mdash;that an
awful change has taken place in her personal
appearance. She was always silly, weak, and
vain; but while she had good grounds for vanity,
the weakness did not appear so silly. Even
when <i>I</i> first knew <i>her</i>, she had some pretensions&mdash;at 
present, it is pretension altogether.</p>

<p>"I give you the <i>carte du pays</i>&mdash;make what use
you choose of it; whether it may be of any service, 
or whether it may not, I, of course, cannot
judge; for strange as it seems, true it is, that
although I am writing to a brother whom I tenderly 
love, I am addressing a gentleman whom I
do not know. This, however, I <i>do</i> know, that
when I was young, I had a disposition for every
sort of gaiety, and a turn of mind for satire and
caricature; and if I had been left&mdash;do not be
angry with me for the expression&mdash;kicking up
and down about London, a lounger in the streets,
an idler in society, and a dangler in the play-house 
green-rooms, my belief is, that I should

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

have ended my career in no very enviable position. 
I, however, was sent forward into the
world, to beat and baffle, not only with the billows 
of the ocean, but of life. Trained regularly
and methodically to business, I became assiduous, 
even by habit; and having gained a confidence, 
which, I believe, I deserved, I find
myself placed in a situation of perfect competence 
and independence, and what is yet more
gratifying, able to make a brother's fortune, if
he choose to secure one.</p>

<p>"You were the favourite, and, of course, my
dear Gilbert, spoiled. I have often ventured to remonstrate, 
in some of my letters to our excellent
mother, after I had experimentally ascertained the
advantages of system, order, and regularity, upon
the loose course of your education, and the manner 
in which you were thrown, much too soon,
as I thought, upon society. However, my dear
Gilbert, I will not frighten you with lectures,
although I will be candid enough to tell you,
that I have heard of you since our poor mother's
death. I received a letter, full of affectionate

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

feeling towards you, from Mrs. Pillman, a lady,
whom, of course, I never knew, but of whom, as
Miss Crab, our mother used to write in the
warmest terms. She, with an almost maternal
regard, told me, with regret, of sundry little
excesses of yours, and of your addiction to a
class of society, which, however agreeable it
may be, does not, in the eyes of the world,
appear altogether respectable. I honour her for
her solicitude, and returned her an answer.
Such friends can have no sinister motive for
their attention.</p>

<p>"All this, I conclude, is now at an end; and
all I beg of you is,&mdash;like and love Mr. Nubley.
I have told you of his peculiarities, but you will
find him an invaluable friend, and perfectly prepared, 
for my sake, to do everything he can for
you.</p>

<p>"I will not tire you with any details of our
views and prospects here. We are continually
agitating the question of opening the trade with
England; and as I have no concern with the
East India Company, but am merely the head

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

of a private mercantile house, I sometimes think,
that great advantages may be derived from such
a measure. However, the chances are, that I
shall be removed from this world,&mdash;or, if not,
certainly from this part of the world,&mdash;before
any such experiment is tried. We have had a
particularly healthy season; and although war
continues in all its vigour, the capture of the
French Islands, with their dependencies, which
always afforded a certain shelter to the enemy,
gives us great relief.</p>

<p>"I will say no more; but wait either to hear
from you or see you, as you may judge most
expedient. At the same time, should you, under
the circumstances, choose to remain at home, I
shall be too happy to increase your income to
any reasonable extent. I am not married, as
you know, and perhaps shall not now enter into
that holy estate; but make no scruple of telling
me your wishes,&mdash;always recollecting, that it
would be the greatest possible gratification to
me to have you here, and to leave in your
hands the means of realizing an ample fortune

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

in a few years, and of eventually establishing
yourself in England, comfortably and respectably.</p>

<p>"Pray take the earliest opportunity of seeing
Mr. Nubley, and should you decide upon coming 
to me, he will give you sundry papers,
essentially important to our affairs. I say
ours, for if you come, you will be received at
once as my partner. God bless you, my dear
brother Gilbert. In writing to you, I feel like a
man playing blind-man's-buff: I should not
know you, even in the light, and grope my way
to your heart and feelings, without being in the
slightest degree aware of the probability of the
success of my appeal. At all events, write;
and write often. In the meantime, believe me,
dear Gilbert,</p>

<p class="right">"Your affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Cuthbert Gurney</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>This letter was a puzzler. Never was anything 
more kind or liberal than the offer it contained, 
and the proposition it presented. The

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

suggestion of an increased income at home, I
could only counterbalance by Cuthbert's desire
to have me abroad. His lecture I felt to be just;
but I could not stomach the active malignity of
that odious Mrs. Pillman,&mdash;the Crab of my earlier
youth,&mdash;who thought it worth her while to write
and undermine me in the affections of my brother. 
If Daly had been unmarried, and in
force, she would have suffered for her duplicity.
I, however, had no time to spare for thinking
about <i>her</i>&mdash;she was beneath my revenge; and I
resolved, notwithstanding the strange description
my brother gave of the Nubleys, to follow his
advice, or, rather, obey his command, of familiarizing 
myself with the newly-arrived couple.
From them, I should learn the details of a residence 
at Calcutta. I should get a lesson of
conduct, and a peep into the prospect of futurity.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I proceeded to the house in
Broad Street,&mdash;obtained the address of Mr.
Nubley (Ibbotson's Hotel, <i>iterum iterumque</i>),&mdash;and 
the following morning presented myself at

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

the door of that popular caravansary of orientalists, 
before eleven o'clock. I was not, however,
fortunate enough to find the curiosity;&mdash;like all
other persons entrusted with the care of letters,
he had&mdash;most naturally for him especially&mdash;forgotten 
all about mine, and had proceeded into
Hampshire, to a Tusculum, which had belonged
to his father; whence, at the suggestion of his
lady wife, he had ejected, at the end of his
term, a valuable tenant, and which Tusculum had
been prepared for his reception several months
before his arrival in England.</p>

<p>I had but one course left to pursue, which was
forthwith to write to Chittagong Lodge, for so
Nubley's house was called, to express my regret
at his departure from London, and offering to
pay him a visit in his retirement. This I did;
and to my proposition received the following
answer:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="right"><i>Chittagong Lodge, April</i> 15.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have many apologies to make to you. I

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

meant to have called on you when in town&mdash;haven't 
been in town for thirty-five years, I
believe. I quite forgot to do so&mdash;and it was
only Mrs. Nubley's finding the letter from your
brother&mdash;she sent it to the agents. Very cold
winds here&mdash;I have got a bad tooth-ache.
Country strangely perplexed, and I do not like
London. Will you come down here, and stay
with us, for ten years if you like. I always
say what I think&mdash;your brother is a capital
fellow&mdash;so are you, I dare say&mdash;come&mdash;we are
close to the high Southampton road&mdash;the house
always was in the same place&mdash;my grandfather
built it. My wife will be delighted to see you&mdash;so 
shall I&mdash;I am sure we shall like you&mdash;stop
till you go to India. Come Monday&mdash;we dine
at six&mdash;coach arrives before five&mdash;anybody will
show you the way.</p>

<p class="right">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Peregrine Nubley</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>"<i>Ex pede Herculem</i>," said I, when I had read
this invitation. The letter was a transcript of

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

Nubley's mind&mdash;a perfect justification of Cuthbert's 
description. What upon earth could be
more agreeable than accepting his invitation&mdash;my 
heart leaped at the prospect; it offered something 
odd, something new; and I lost no time in
replying in the affirmative, and ordering my
man to be ready on the next Monday morning
to take our departure.</p>

<p>Monday came,&mdash;and as it was proposed, so
was it executed. I travelled by the coach, because 
my friend had alluded to that conveyance;
and without accident or incident, having journeyed 
alone, I was set down within a few hundred 
yards of his gates, at a quarter past five in
the afternoon.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> brother's letter had prepared me for an
oddity in the shape of his valued friend and
partner; but differently from what in most
cases falls out, the reality by far exceeded my
anticipations. It is impossible to conceive the
appearance of Mr. Nubley, I need not, therefore, 
say it is impossible to describe it. I will
endeavour to sketch him, but I know the
effort is vain.</p>

<p>I had seen Indians of all grades, ages and
classes, I do not mean the savage tribes of American 
Indians; but Indians, so called from having
resided in our different settlements in the East,
although British born. I have seen the yellow-cheeked 
civilian, and the well bronzed soldier
of half a century's standing, and these in all
their varieties; but Mr. Nubley, who received me

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

at the door of his hospitable house, was unlike
anything I had ever seen. In the first place, he
was in no way connected with the Honourable
John Company (as the Court of Directors, and
the proprietary generally, are <i>corporately</i> called
in that country). He was merely, purely, and
simply, a merchant, who had accumulated a
fortune; and now, as it appeared, was about to
instruct me in the "way in which I ought to
go," to do the same. But, when I beheld him,
as he was, and murmured to myself&mdash;must I
be <i>that</i> when I return, I confess, however gratified 
I was by the warmth of his reception, I
began very much to doubt as to my subsequent
proceedings.</p>

<p>He was in figure short and thin; his head
much too large for his body, and bald, with a
little fringe of silver hair behind; his eyes were
like those of whitings after three days' keeping;
his mouth exceedingly like that of a frog; the
profoundest melancholy characterized his countenance; 
and his words, in a tone of voice exceedingly 
inharmonious, drawled slowly over his

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

lips, interrupted occasionally by sighs. The
consequence was, as Cuthbert had stated, that
long before he had finished the sentence with
which he had started, his thoughts wandered,
and having entirely lost the thread of his discourse, 
a new subject succeeded, which was
treated in a similar manner: thus producing a
confusion of words and ideas, that, if I had not
been upon my guard, would have set me into
one of those immoderate fits of laughter, which,
at my then time of life, were something terrific.</p>

<p>It was when he had completely mystified
himself, and entangled his conversation in a
hard knot, that he began to think, meditate, and
soliloquize. Truly enough had Cuthbert told me,
that he "thought aloud;" in less than three
hours after my reception, I had plenty of proofs
of his correctness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nubley&mdash;it may sound ungallant, coarse,
and even unfeeling, but really, I cannot disguise 
my feelings&mdash;was, without any exception,
the greatest fool I ever encountered in all my
life, before or since. I am the last man in the

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

world to admire a very blue lady. There are
in this country, women of abilities, superior, I
am sure, to those of the women of any other
nation on the earth&mdash;abilities blended, not only
with softness, diffidence, and modesty, but based
upon principles of the highest order, and the purest 
character. Such women are to be admired,
venerated, and respected; but in the ordinary
run of society, where a very considerable portion
of imaginary talent and sense, consists of flourish 
and pretension, I seek nothing beyond the
quiet possession of the common run of accomplishments. 
And, although I do not quite agree
with one of the cleverest men in the country,
who says, all that is required of a woman, is to
be nicely dressed, and play the piano-forte, I am
easily satisfied; and, however much I may be
astonished by the multitudinous acquirements
of the pedestal ladies, I prefer, for "home consumption," 
the mild, the modest, and the gentle
being, whose winning influence, and tender
care, can make that home a heaven.</p>

<p>For home-consumption, however, Mrs. Nubley 

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

was not made; slenderly educated, if educated 
at all, she was, as soon as she was fit for
the Indian market, sent out by her father, who,
having been left a widower, married a second
wife, and was, together with his juvenile spouse,
extremely glad to ship off Caroline, consigned to
a highly-respectable firm in Calcutta, where, after
a few exhibitions, she attracted the notice of the
prosperous Nubley, and they were married.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Miss Caddie&mdash;for such
was her name before she, fortunately for herself
and Peregrine, changed it&mdash;had been pretty;
there were yet the remains of beauty about her.
She was, however, as Cuthbert had described her,
a white variety; but from the mode in which she
dressed, and the way in which she talked, I was
certain she saw no change in herself since the day
she left Mrs. Oglethorpe's seminary, at Stepney.
She must, however, speak for herself: the leading 
characteristic of the stuff she uttered, was an
affected disbelief of every thing that was told
her. An exclamation of delight, at the comicality 
of her companions, even when engaged

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

upon the most serious subjects, concluding universally 
with a parrot-like scream of laughter, a
toss up of the head, and an involuntary application
of three of her fingers to her mouth&mdash;an action
which had grown into habit, from the double
advantage it possessed, of exhibiting the snowy
whiteness of her hand, and hiding a <i>hiatus
vald&egrave; deflendus</i>, caused by the absence without
leave of one of her front teeth.</p>

<p>Such was the pair, so</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Justly formed to meet by nature,"</p>

</div>

<p>with whom I found myself domesticated at
Chittagong Lodge.</p>

<p>I confess, the first evening hung rather heavy
on hand. The house contained a mixture of
old-fashioned furniture, and of newly-imported
gim-crackery from India. Everything smelt of
shawls and sandal-wood, combined with a strong
flavour of curry and mulligatawney; and yet
neither of the people seemed in keeping with
the objects and atmosphere by which they were
surrounded.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

<p>When I was left alone with mine host, I felt
a sort of dread of the business upon which I was
certain he was about to enter, notwithstanding
the relief I experienced by the removal of Mrs.
Nubley to the drawing room. The clapper in
a cherry-tree to frighten away birds, and the
cackling of hens, each cackle concluded by the
scream of a peacock, in wet weather, were all
imitated, and indeed embodied, in her conversation&mdash;even 
the melancholy drawl and drone of
her exemplary husband, afforded repose to mine
ears: and having after a few minutes discovered
that the discourse of the day was to be devoted
to his own discomforts and disappointments since
he returned home&mdash;or, as he appeared to think
it, come abroad&mdash;I listened with the devoted
patience of a doomed one, determined that he
ought to have his way in his own house, especially 
in the absence of his better half.</p>

<p>"I never was happy," said Nubley, "till I
left India&mdash;I never was so miserable as I am now&mdash;fogs&mdash;cold&mdash;came 
over in a bad ship&mdash;badly
found&mdash;bad captain&mdash;my wife&mdash;uncomfortable&mdash;delicate 

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

constitution&mdash;I can't bear salt beef&mdash;not 
half enough poultry&mdash;eh!"&mdash;here he paused,
and fixed his eyes upon me, and began to pick
the stubble hair out of his chin, with a short
sharp sort of jerk&mdash;he sat so occupied for about
half a minute, when he began to think&mdash;"Umph&mdash;knew 
his father&mdash;foolish man&mdash;not quite so
ugly as Cuthbert&mdash;don't think he'll ever come
to good in the house&mdash;I'll see."</p>

<p>I was the subject of the reverie&mdash;I did not
exactly know how to act, but having been prepared, 
I thought it best to let him fancy that he
had said nothing.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Sir," said I, "you feel the
change of climate, after so long an absence?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied my interesting companion,
"I feel the change of every thing. When I arrived&mdash;eh!&mdash;the 
first thing you see I did&mdash;a
man likes the place where he was born and bred&mdash;Hottentots 
do&mdash;so do the Swiss&mdash;eh!&mdash;and I
remembered my native place&mdash;took my wife&mdash;why 
the devil I ever married I can't think&mdash;amiable 
woman to be sure&mdash;talk&mdash;eh!&mdash;don't

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

she talk&mdash;I don't know why I should ask <i>him</i>
the question&mdash;I took her there&mdash;nobody knew
her&mdash;overhung with trees&mdash;there was the church
tower&mdash;and wind-mill on the hill, just as I left
them&mdash;told her of all the beauxs and belles of
the town&mdash;eh!&mdash;Captain Gossamer, as we used
to call Tom Wilkins&mdash;best dancer in the world&mdash;eh!&mdash;the 
Miss Mayfields&mdash;the graces&mdash;symmetry&mdash;famous&mdash;and 
little Fanny Thompson&mdash;dear 
thing, I remember her&mdash;in powder and a
sack&mdash;feathers&mdash;three feet high, and high heels
to her shoes&mdash;took my wife there&mdash;made a point
of going to the county ball&mdash;asked for my
friends&mdash;two of the Miss Mayfields had died
widows&mdash;saw three of their grandchildren dancing&mdash;and 
the third was bed-ridden. Tom
Wilkins, Gossamer Tom, was wheeled into the
room in a chair, his body as big as a Dorchester 
butt, and his leg as thick as a mile-stone&mdash;eh!"</p>

<p>"The effect must have been singular," said I.</p>

<p>"That's a silly remark," thought Nubley;

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

"never mind&mdash;it was singular&mdash;Fanny Thompson, 
a thing like a tetotum, died in the year '99
of a dropsy; and when I asked where young
Bob Buzz, the curate, was,&mdash;the finest fellow I
ever saw to switch a rasper, as he used to call it&mdash;I 
found he was Bishop of Dorchester&mdash;my friend
Tippit, the attorney, had been hanged for forgery
fourteen years before; and Squill, the apothecary,
had run away with the squire's daughter; and
after passing what the monsters told me was a
long and happy life, had died worth a hundred
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Curious," said I, not knowing exactly what
to do.</p>

<p>"I tell you what was more curious still,"
said Nubley; "you'd hardly believe that I
could see the changes in all these people,&mdash;but 
la, bless your heart, they didn't know
<i>me</i>, who was not altered at all&mdash;not one of the
survivors recollected me. Wilkins, with his
great gouty toe, asked somebody who that old
gentleman was&mdash;meaning me. Now, Sir, I

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

don't feel myself one bit altered since I danced
Sir Roger de Coverley at Christmas, in that
very room, with a cocked hat on my head."</p>

<p>"One does not perceive the change in self&mdash;it 
is produced so gradually," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's it, is it?" said mine host. "You
are a very wise fellow, no doubt&mdash;umph&mdash;my
wife, too&mdash;that's a woman&mdash;there's spirits&mdash;wonderful&mdash;how 
she does go on&mdash;even in such
a wind as this&mdash;you call this fine weather, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"For this country," said I.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in any other?" said
Nubley.</p>

<p>That was a most awkward question, because I
had not. I replied "No&mdash;but that I judged by
description."</p>

<p>"Never judge by description," said Nubley.
"My father bought this house by description&mdash;to 
me the horridest hole I ever was in."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir!&mdash;surely it is remarkably pleasant," 
said I.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

<p>"Pleasant, is it?" said Nubley; "well then
I lie, and you are a fine gentleman."</p>

<p>This observation startled me, not being prepared 
for language so violent, or an antithesis
so strong&mdash;I merely made a sort of conciliatory 
noise.</p>

<p>"You write plays, don't you?" said Nubley.</p>

<p>Pleasant again, thought I.</p>

<p>"Not plays, Sir," said I.</p>

<p>"Farces, don't you call 'em?&mdash;pantomimes&mdash;eh?" 
said my friend; "stuff&mdash;trumpery&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I never wrote but one, Sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! that was one too many," replied my
agreeable companion; and then again setting
his grey eyes right on my face, he began stubbling 
his chin, as before, and, in a soft tone, and
slow manner, said, "Broke his mother's heart&mdash;nice 
farce to do that&mdash;wonder if he cared about
it&mdash;should not think he did."</p>

<p>I found it the most difficult thing in the world
to know what to do, while undergoing the ordeal
of his cogitations. I felt greatly inclined to

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

notice what he uttered, because I knew whence,
and whence only, he could have obtained this
impression. The indefatigable malevolence of
the late Miss Crab had been at work, and I had
no doubt she had given Cuthbert an unfavourable 
impression of me, my pursuits, and acquaintances;&mdash;founded, 
perhaps, to a certain
extent, in justice, which, upon the principle of
a process in art, long afterwards discovered,
Cuthbert had transferred to the mind,&mdash;if mind
it might be called,&mdash;which was now throwing off
a few proofs of the success of the experiment.</p>

<p>"Ah!" drawled out my agreeable companion,
resuming the chair, after his brains had been in
committee, and speaking, instead of thinking,&mdash;
"we had better go and have some coffee. Mrs.
Nubley is alone&mdash;poor body&mdash;very dull for her,
after the society she has been used to&mdash;pleasant
people, too, in the neighbourhood&mdash;some of
them dine here to-morrow&mdash;the Empsons&mdash;agreeable 
family&mdash;daughters&mdash;eh&mdash;live in the
house with the red bricks and white facings, on
your right hand&mdash;and the Illingworths, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

parson, Wells,&mdash;very jolly,&mdash;like him&mdash;eh&mdash;preaches 
short sermons&mdash;and plays long whist&mdash;like 
to play against him, eh&mdash;do you play
whist?"</p>

<p>Before I could reply to a question the answer
to which I apprehended would place me,&mdash;as
they say of a boy at school,&mdash;in the esteem of
my host and patron, he had fallen into a reverie,
and fixed his vacant stare upon me, and had
expressed his opinion,&mdash;"Shouldn't think you
could&mdash;not head enough for whist&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>That I did not usually play whist, I ventured
to say;&mdash;that I did not know anything of the
game, I thought it as well to conceal.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see," continued Nubley; "we'll
have our coffee, and then we'll see what you can
do with a dummy against Mrs. N. and me&mdash;longs&mdash;I 
can't bear shorts&mdash;I play whist for
amusement, and I like it&mdash;the longer the game
lasts, the more amusement it gives me&mdash;eh. I
dare say you think me an old fool&mdash;I don't care
a cowrie for that&mdash;come."</p>

<p>The last remark with which Mr. Nubley

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

favoured me, was so equivocally delivered, that
I should have fancied he had been speaking,
instead of thinking; but as there was a doubt,
and if I had noticed it, I must have made some
fine flaming speech, complimentary to his wisdom, 
I merely simpered, and prepared to follow
him; when, as he proceeded to ring the bell, to
announce our removal to the servant, I heard
him mutter, "I wonder what the deuce he is
grinning at?"</p>

<p>I admit, that having passed four hours in
Chittagong Lodge, I did repent a little of having 
at once plunged <i>in medias res</i>, and pledged
myself to a protracted visit. However, time
softens asperities, and I hoped that the Nubleys,
like olives, would become more palatable when
I got accustomed to them; and, resolving to put
the best face upon the matter, and, according
to Cuthbert's recommendation, dig for the ore
through the unpromising soil, I proceeded to
the drawing-room, where sat Mrs. Nubley alone,
on a sofa, playing at cup-and-ball.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

<p>"Lauk, Nubley," screamed the lady, "what
a time you have been. I'm dead sleepy;&mdash;all
your fault, Mr. Gurney, every bit of it. Your
sex, in England, are so inattentive to females&mdash;he, 
he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"I assure you," said I, "that time has flown
so agreeably, that I was not at all conscious of
the time."</p>

<p>"Lauk!" replied the fair creature, "how can
you talk so?&mdash;you are such a man for quizzing.
Agreeable! I'm sure you must have made all
the agreeableness yourself&mdash;he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my dear," said Mr. Nubley;
"tastes differ. We have had some very interesting 
conversation."</p>

<p>I endeavoured to consider to what part of our
dialogue this observation was applicable.</p>

<p>"May be so," retorted the lady; "Mr. N.
can be very agreeable when I am absent, and
anywhere but at home: I always say he hangs
his fiddle up with his hat&mdash;did you ever hear
that saying before, Mr. Gurney?&mdash;he, he, he!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

<p>"Once, I think, Ma'am," said I, with becoming 
gravity.</p>

<p>"Once," said Nubley, "a thousand times, it
is in all the jest books"&mdash;and then came a reverie, 
"What a fool she is, trying to play the
agreeable with that young coxcomb."&mdash;"Have
you had your tea, my dear?" followed immediately.</p>

<p>"No," said the lady, "the fool hasn't had
her tea."</p>

<p>Nubley growled, and walked to the window,
and there indulged in a long conversation with
himself.</p>

<p>I discovered, however, by Mrs. Nubley's observation, 
that the mental ejaculations of her
happy husband were not always suffered to pass
unnoticed, at least by her. The effect her
remark produced, was however sufficiently
visible to assure me that it was somewhat out of
the ordinary run of events. Mr. Nubley grew
cold and reserved, and acting upon the principle 
of buckets in a well, Mrs. Nubley became

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

proportionably more lively: she rattled and
clattered in the most marvellous manner; described 
all the families in the neighbourhood;
gave me a catalogue <i>raisonn&eacute;</i> of the beauties,
and summed up, by bidding me take care
and not lose my heart to Miss Wells, the
rector's daughter; concluding with one of her
most violent convulsions of laughter, and a look,
which at sixteen, would no doubt have been
very exhilarating.</p>

<p>The next day came the talked of party, and
the relief was delightful; the description of Mr.
and Mrs. Nubley of their neighbours had not
been overcharged; the people were agreeable,
and pretty, and very nice; but my choice was
made after half an hour's association with them&mdash;the 
Wellses were the flowers of the flock.
Wells was an extremely pleasant man, and
Mrs. Wells, when and where she liked, an
agreeable woman. The daughter&mdash;for although
there were three, one only came to dinner&mdash;was
extremely nice, and rational and agreeable; she

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

was palish, with soft, intelligent, blueish greyish
eyes, and under those eyes a darkness of skin
to <i>me</i> most engaging; she had fair hair, and a remarkably 
pretty mouth, about which there was a
playfulness, which gave a peculiar air of <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>
to all her observations. None of her features
were what some particular and affected personages
would call classical: but she was "very nice."
Her figure, though upon a small scale, was particularly 
good, just plump enough to hide angles,
and full of those in-and-out-isms which constitute
in my mind true symmetry; as for her feet, Cinderella's 
slippers would have been, as Shakspeare
says, "a world too wide."</p>

<p>The day and evening passed away, much as
days and evenings do, but by a sort of congeniality 
of feeling, which I cannot describe, Mr.
Wells and I, and Miss Wells and I, and Mrs.
Wells and I, seemed to be more together than
any others of the party. I found him full of
anecdote, of ready wit, and of certainly a convivial 
turn. Mrs. Wells saw that I admired her
daughter, and therefore set me down for a

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

gentleman of taste; and Miss Wells, being
equally aware of my opinion, was in so good a
humour as to be really delightful.</p>

<p>This pre-disposition in my favour, was, I
have no doubt, strengthened by the representations 
made by Mrs. Nubley of the wealth of my
brother, and of the opportunity which presented
itself to me of joining him in the extensive
concerns of his important establishment. Every
thing was <i>couleur de rose;</i> and when we broke up
for the night, Mr. Wells hoped I would call upon
him the next day: he had a capital billiard-table,
a good library, guns, fishing-rods, every thing
that could contribute to killing time and game,
and he should be delighted, and so on.</p>

<p>When they were gone, we of course talked
over our friends; but when Mrs. Nubley began
rallying me about my particular attention to the
Wellses, I thought I never heard anything so
grating and discordant in my life, as the tone of
her voice. Yet when she praised Mrs. Wells and
her family, I thought it sounded infinitely less
inharmonious.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

<p>I <i>did</i> call at Wells's next day; I did see his
comfortable house, and his library, and his rods,
and his guns, and his billiard-table; played half-a-dozen 
games with him,&mdash;we were an excellent
match,&mdash;just what is always agreeable to a billiard
player in his own house, he could win four games
out of six; and there I stayed until it was time to
go home, as I called it, to dinner. Wells even
pressed me to stop and partake of theirs; but I
felt it was impossible to absent myself from the
Nubleys without notice or permission, so I returned 
to Chittagong-house&mdash;not however without 
regret, nor before I had promised to go the
next day to luncheon with the Wellses.</p>

<p>This was the first morning of my acquaintance
with this worthy family. I candidly admit, that
what I saw I liked, and perhaps&mdash;however ungracious 
it may seem to say so&mdash;liked it all the
better from the contrast it afforded to the proceedings 
at <i>our</i> establishment. I need scarcely
say, that the visit was repeated, and repeated,
until my visits there became habitual; and until
at last Mrs. Nubley began to complain of my exclusive 

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

attentions there, as depriving her of what
she was pleased to call "<i>my</i> agreeable society."
However, she had a female friend just arrived,
who was staying with her; and at my then time of
life, I was in the habit of gratifying my inclinations 
and pleasing myself, without perhaps a due
regard to the feelings or expectations of others.</p>

<p>Nubley went dreaming on, and although I
had been at Chittagong Lodge upwards of five
weeks, never had once touched upon the subject
which brought us together. I lived in a state of
indescribable nervousness lest he should broach
it; and he, I really believe, feeling himself, even
divided as my attentions were, relieved and supported 
by my presence, was equally unwilling
to press a topic, the discussion of which would
in all probability terminate my stay. He had
installed me as croupier at his dinner-table, and
besides treating me openly with attention and
kindness, had evidently changed his opinion of
me, a fact which I collected from his murmured
thoughts. One thing seemed strange, and was
certainly complimentary to me. It seemed as

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

if I were equally agreeable to the mistress as
to the master of the house; and having arranged
my mornings much to my satisfaction, and the
evenings being frequently varied, either by
making visits or receiving company, I began to
be quite comfortable under the unpromising roof
of my hospitable friend.</p>

<p>As for the effects of my semi-domestication
at Wells's, like the approaches of age, they
were so gradual, as to be individually almost
imperceptible. Nothing on earth is so treacherous, 
or so delightful, as the habitual association 
with agreeable people in the country. In
London there is a round&mdash;a circle&mdash;a sphere&mdash;and 
people move in it, and jostle, and part, and
talk, and flirt, and laugh, and separate, and,
except for a moment in assemblies or at balls,
do not meet perhaps again for a month. But
in the country, placed as I was with this dear delightful 
family, the attachment grew hourly and
daily, until I at last became identified with their
pursuits and amusements; until, when I began
to think it absolutely necessary to leave the

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

Nubleys, lest, as the saying goes, I should wear
out my welcome, I found it more difficult than
ever to make up my mind to part from the
Wellses.</p>

<p>Of course it will be thought, as indeed it
was said, by several of those meddling gossip-mongers 
who invariably infest small country
town society, and who, having been civilly
drawn out of their sequestered houses or lodgings
to enjoy the amusements and conversation of
their wealthier or more aristocratic neighbours,
repay those little attentions, by making observations 
upon all combinations and connections
they happen to see; and retail, in their own
<i>coterie</i>, every incident or conversation, whence
they can collect subject matter to wound or
annoy innocent people, who are merely following 
the bent of their own inclinations, and enjoying 
the "goods the Gods provide," that I
was a received and accepted lover. My constant
visits at the rectory were food for all sorts
of stories; and, above all, for the report that
I was almost immediately to be married to Miss

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

Wells. Now, how really stood the case?&mdash;the
family of the Wellses liked <i>me</i>, and I liked <i>them</i>,
and so we lived constantly together.</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth, in one of her admirable
novels, has expressed her opinion of the important 
effects of juxtaposition in bringing about
the most serious change in our state of life; and
certain it is, that its influence is never so decidedly 
powerful as when the <i>two</i>, so constantly
together, are associated in a quiet neighbourhood, 
where either party is intimately acquainted
with all the peculiarities of the <i>locale</i>, and all the
combinations and connexions of its inhabitants.
Both are then competent to judge, and to discuss, 
and even to think alike; and certainly, if
Harriet Wells and I ever thought or talked of
anything except ourselves, our conversation derived 
its peculiar interest from the community
of our knowledge as to men and matters by
which we were surrounded.</p>

<p>As I write this without any view of its meeting 
the eye of strangers, I will honestly confess,
that I had as much idea of being in love with

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

Harriet Wells as I had of flying. As Wolcot,
the radical rhymer, who called himself Peter
Pindar, said, when speaking of the wonderful
powers of Mrs. Siddons, and the effect producible
by those powers upon the tenderer passions of
the other sex,&mdash;"She is beautiful, magnificent,
and enchanting, but I should as soon think of
marrying the Archbishop of Canterbury." Now,
Harriet was extremely nice and agreeable; but
I certainly had no more idea of marrying her
than Peter had of pairing with the Primate.</p>

<p>It is true, that, after a time, Harriet and I
walked about together. I went to her father's
house every day after breakfast, and she used to
sit down at the pianoforte, and her sister Fanny
accompanied her, and they played duets; and
then we fancied we liked particular songs,&mdash;"<i>Sul 
margine</i>" I recollect, was one,&mdash;and
Eliza, the youngest of the Wellses, a little
plump thing in a pinafore, used to mix in our
revels; and then we had luncheon, and then
Mrs. Wells was very good-natured, and then I
used to play the Devil with the girls; and then&mdash;&mdash;

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

But stay; somebody <i>may</i> see what I write,
and, be it understood that, by playing the
"Devil," I mean playing a game so called,
which originated, I think, with the Cherokees,
but was introduced into this country about the
period of which I treat, and received with an
enthusiasm not to be described. The devil was
a wooden thing, shaped like an hour-glass, and
he danced merrily upon a string extended scientifically 
between two sticks, and he hopped up,
and he dropped down, and we twirled him this
way, and wriggled him the other way, and tossed
him over our heads, and caught him upon our
line, and then, Devil-like, across the sticks;&mdash;and, 
in short, he made very good fun. From
the influence of this imp, "no age, no profession, 
no station, was free;" and "the greatest and
gravest" were its votaries. Judges and bishops
have been known to participate in its delights,
and the Board of Admiralty, with the first Lord
at its head, have been seen, relaxing from the
severer duties of state, in the diabolical amusement, 
in the garden at the back of their office,

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

at Charing Cross. At this harmless diversion I
was, what Etonians call, a dab; and Harriet's
figure looked so pretty when her arms were
uplifted to catch the descending devil, that I
really thought I never beheld anything much
more engaging. I suppose she saw, by my
eyes, what I thought; for she seemed to grow
more and more good-natured as our acquaintance 
matured, and at last appeared to expect me
at luncheon as regularly as she looked for that
semi-demi-dinner itself.</p>

<p>But, dear me, I did not <i>love</i> her. I felt none
of that hangable, drownable desperation about
her that I had once felt before for another.
Not I. I was interested about her, merely by
Miss Edgeworth's juxtaposition. My visits had
become habitual. I seemed to be looked for at
Mr. Wells's, and I should not have fancied my
day properly made out, if I had not gone there;
and then I knew everything that was in the
girls' work-boxes, and in their music books; and I
tossed over the threads, and pulled about the strips
of muslin, and picked the pins out of the pincushions, 

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

and stuck them in again, and talked of
Widow Harrison's sprained ankle, and old Walker's 
rheumatism, and went with Harriet and
Fanny, loaded with flannel for one, and a bottle
of wine for the other. In short, there I was,
happy beyond measure, having a dear, sweet-tempered 
creature always on my arm, or, if not
leaning so, sauntering by my side, till at last I
never felt happy unless I were there;&mdash;and yet
I was not in love.</p>

<p>The time, however, as I have just said, had
arrived, at which, it appeared to me, that I
ought to quit Chittagong Lodge. "Harriet,"
said I,&mdash;I had got to call her Harriet, and had,
I admit, established a slight right of familiarity
with her, by voting myself her brother. It is
quite extraordinary by what means congenial
spirits commingle. I used to call her "sister,"
and so called her Harriet;&mdash;she used to call me
"brother," and so called me Gilbert: and then
she was a bit of an astronomer, and she loved to
watch the moon when it was full and bright, and
we used to go and look at it; and then I used to

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

be so very much afraid that she would catch
cold; and then I used to tie her handkerchief
round her neck, and then she used to thank
"her brother," and then "her brother" used to
be very much pleased with her sisterly gratitude, 
and I believe once or twice, not oftener,
permitted his approbation of her sororial affection 
to produce a sort of fraternal acknowledgment, 
which, between two such near and dear
relations, could not be very wrong. And this
was the way I went on, but without an idea of
my pure affection for the dear girl ever assuming
any other character.</p>

<p>"Harriet," said I, the moon being exceedingly 
bright, "what a dreadful thing it is, that
when a man is most happy he is most miserable!"</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?" said Harriet.</p>

<p>"I mean," said I, "that no human being can
be more perfectly happy than I am at this
moment; and yet, paradise as it is, I must
leave it."</p>

<p>"Leave it!" said Miss Wells, and her dove-like 

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

eyes were turned upon me with a look not
to be forgotten. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I must go to town," said I.</p>

<p>"Must you?" said Harriet, and I felt a sort
of involuntary pressure on my arm;&mdash;she was
leaning on it;&mdash;and then came a dead silence&mdash;a 
pause of five minutes. It was at that moment
I first began to think I was fonder of Harriet
than I meant to be; for what on earth endears a
girl to one so much,&mdash;what so entirely upsets
all resolutions, fetters the mind, and chains the
heart, as the notion that <i>she</i> loves?</p>

<p>I found I could not break this silence. Harriet 
kept her eyes on the ground, and walked
with a measured step. I felt that she trembled.
What could I, what ought I, to do? I had but
three hundred and ninety pounds a-year, certain.
She had nothing: as I have said before, two
negatives make an affirmative in grammar, but,
"barring <i>accidence</i>," two nothings never make
anything. I should have liked to have caught
her to my heart, utterly stifled her with kisses,
and proposed; but I had no right to do so. I

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

had no right to presume to take a charming girl
out of a sphere in which she was happily placed,
and subject her to the ups and downs of a life
regulated only by the annual receipt of three hundred 
and ninety pounds. So I just laid my hand
upon my heart, and said, <i>sotto voce</i>, "Be quiet."</p>

<p>The eloquence of silence is proverbial. We
both felt it; and Harriet made no effort to
speak, until just as we got to a side gate, opening 
into her father's grounds. The sight of
home seemed to reassure her; and the consciousness 
that such was her feeling, made me
uncomfortable. Trusted with this young creature 
(young enough myself, God knows!), and
having had her thus implicitly confided to me in
our wanderings, could I have wounded her feelings 
so deeply, that, until she felt that sort of
instinctive courage which, if not the paternal
presence, the paternal property (the consciousness 
of being at home), could give, she did not
dare speak till then? No, no. I had done nothing, 
said nothing, which could intentionally
offend her.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

<p>"And when," said she, having evidently kept
my last words in her thoughts ever since they
were uttered&mdash;"and when do you go, Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"I think the day after to-morrow," said I.</p>

<p>"I thought," replied the dear, kind-hearted
creature, "you were engaged to dance with
Miss Illingworth at the ball on Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"Miss Illingworth?" said I, with unaffected
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gilbert," said Miss Wells. "If <i>you</i>
forget your promises, I do not. I heard you
make that promise at Mrs. Nubley's the other
evening. I never forget what I hear."</p>

<p>"I dare say you are right," said I, glad to
affect a sort of gaiety; "but I scarcely recollect
Miss Illingworth herself."</p>

<p>"Ah! then you should," replied Harriet.
"What is sport to <i>you</i>, may be death to <i>her</i>.
Hopes are excited, thoughts inspired, wishes
created, by a word or a look, where the feelings
are interested, or the heart prepossessed. <i>You</i>
forget what you said; perhaps <i>she</i> does not. I

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

know she admires you: it will wound her if you
are not present to fulfil your promise, for she
has talked about it to others."</p>

<p>"My dear Harriet," said I, "bright as the
moon is, I am delighted that it is even yet so
dark that my blushes cannot be seen. I give
you my honour that, if I did say anything of the
sort to Miss Illingworth, it was said most inadvertently; 
and as for anything I may say to a
young lady, amongst the many of this neighbourhood, 
having an effect upon her heart, you
really do me too much honour."</p>

<p>Harriet drew her arm from mine,&mdash;I cannot
describe how,&mdash;and, in a tone of something between 
laughing and crying, exclaimed, "Here's
mamma waiting for us." So she was. Harriet,
however, passed her, and ran into the house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gurney," said Mrs. Wells, "you keep
that girl out too late; she is a delicate creature,
and ought not to breathe night air. I really
must insist upon it, that she does not stay in the
grounds after the evening has closed in."</p>

<p>It was very evident that Mrs. Wells was very

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

angry, and I endeavoured to mollify her ire by
making an observation upon the clearness of the
sky and the brightness of the moon, to which
she did not appear to me to return such agreeable 
answers as heretofore had dropped from
her lips. As the aspect of affairs seemed
gloomy, I thought the next best thing to do was
to effect a retreat, and I accordingly wished her
a good night, to that she returned a sort of
half-and-half answer; when, to my surprise, I
heard a sudden rustling in, or rather out of, a
laurel hedge that flanked the walk by which
Harriet and I had returned to the house, succeeded 
by the immediate appearance of Mr.
Wells himself, who exclaimed, in a mock-heroic
tone&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">" 'Who talks of going, with a voice so sweet?' "</p>

</div>

<p>"What!" cried Mrs. Wells, "are <i>you</i> there
my dear?"</p>

<p>"My love, I am," replied Wells. "But what
do you mean by letting Gilbert go at this unusually 
early hour? Where's Harriet?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 152 -->

<p>"She is in the house," said the matron.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Wells, "so will we be
soon. You, of course, will stop, Gurney, and
have our little music, and our piquet, and our
<i>petit souper</i>&mdash;eh? Nothing like winding-up
well."</p>

<p>"I thought you were gone to bed," said Mrs.
Wells to her husband.</p>

<p>"Did you, my dear?" answered he; "then,
for once in your life, you were mistaken. Come,
let us go in. Is the billiard-room lighted? Let
us be gay&mdash;life is short; we will have a touch
at the queues and balls. Come&mdash;come along."</p>

<p>And so, with great joyousness, we entered
the hospitable old house by one of the modernised 
French windows, which, as the French themselves 
say, "gave to the lawn."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more comfortable&mdash;nothing
more agreeable. We went to the billiard-room. I
chose my favourite queue,&mdash;chalked him&mdash;poised
him&mdash;pointed the red ball&mdash;and went off (which
Mr. Wells always forced me to do); but I made
nothing, and did not feel quite sure what ought

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

to be done with the balls when my respectable
adversary had played, because&mdash;and it was quite
a new feeling&mdash;Harriet was not in the room.
The pinafores were gone to bed; and Mrs.
Wells, who did not seem to have recovered her
good temper, established herself at a work-table
in the billiard-room, which served as a second
drawing-room, and was by no means exclusively
devoted to the game.</p>

<p>I wondered where Harriet was. I never had
felt either anxious about her coming or going
before; but it seemed to me that our dialogue in
the garden had closed unsatisfactorily, and I was
afraid that she was somehow affronted, or
wounded, or annoyed, and had gone to bed, as
well as her sisters. I saw the balls running
about the table, but my mind was not with them:
my thoughts were up-stairs&mdash;fixed on things
above.</p>

<p>"Why, you cannot make a hazard, Gilbert:
what <i>is</i> the matter?" said Wells.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said I. "That is a
cannon, however."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

<p>"Not a bit of it!" exclaimed the enthusiastic
performer,&mdash;"a kiss!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, "probably. Then here goes
again."</p>

<p>"And that," exclaimed my opponent, "is a
miss!"</p>

<p>I did not at all like this combination of words,
and, in fact, wished the game at Old Scratch, when
suddenly was opened the door of the billiard-room, 
and in came Harriet, looking as demure, as
placid, as good-natured, and as perfectly alive
to the ordinary amusements of the evening as
ever. I watched her, to see if there were a trace
of ill-feeling towards me on her countenance.
Dear soul! no. And when she sat herself down
by her mother, and commenced that most absurd
of all anomalous nonsenses called "work," I felt
that I was extremely glad she took so much interest 
in my concerns, and showed so much anxiety
for my fulfilment of engagements.</p>

<p>I won't go the day after to-morrow, thought I,
as I gave my ball a thump which caused it to hit
the other white ball exactly on the opposite side

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

to that which I meant it to touch. I will stay,
and I will dance with Miss Illingworth, to show
Harriet that I religiously keep my word, and
prove to her how powerfully her reproof has
acted upon me. Just as if she had known my
thoughts, Harriet lifted her eyes from the strip
of muslin which she held in her hand, and looked
towards me. Our eyes met. I cannot define
the character of their expression; but I recollect
saying to myself, "Upon my life, I am carrying
this joke a little too far."</p>

<p>At half-past ten, as usual, supper was announced, 
and we proceeded to the dinner
parlour&mdash;room never to be forgotten by <i>me</i>. It
was a low wainscotted apartment, with a beam
below the ceiling, which it supported, crossing
it in the middle. Every footstep in the chambers 
above, could be heard over-head; and,
except that it was of a good size, it was by no
means a desirable <i>salle &aacute; manger</i>. To <i>me</i>, however, 
it was delightful: it had been consecrated
by hospitality and kindness; and the strongest
feeling by which I was actuated, as I led my

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

amiable hostess into it, was that of regret that,
whether I stayed till Wednesday or not, I must
at all events, leave it within a very few days.</p>

<p>Yet, for all that, I felt assured that I did not
love Harriet,&mdash;not as lovers love. The great
puzzle was, how to define the sentiment which
she had inspired. It was more than friendship.
Friendship cannot last long between two people
circumstanced as we were. Of Platonism I
have a very faint notion; for it seems to me
that feelings, like time, cannot stand still: to
what point my intimacy with Harriet had carried
mine I could not exactly ascertain; and certainly
had never imagined how essential her society had
habitually become to my happiness, until I found
myself on the eve of being deprived of it.</p>

<p>At supper, Harriet seemed out of spirits,
and her mother, what I considered watchful,&mdash;and 
a watchful mother, in a small party, is
unbearable. On the contrary, mine host was
more than usually agreeable: his conversation
was full of joke and repartee, in which he was
eminently successful when he chose to be so;

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

but, somehow, it appeared to me that he talked
more than usual of the advantages of matrimony,
its comforts&mdash;its blessings&mdash;the respectability it
gave to a young man&mdash;the refined delights it
afforded to a young woman.</p>

<p>"Sarah and I," said Mr. Wells, "are proofs
of the soundness of my doctrine. We married
young, and have lived long, and never repented
it,&mdash;never disqualified for Dunmow yet."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said the lady, "if we ever <i>have</i>
differed, the fault has been yours; and I must
say, with regard to the doctrine you are now
supporting, I <i>do</i> differ entirely. Why should
people think about marrying without means?
The old proverb is quite true&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which Moore has so sweetly versified,"
said I.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of versification, Mr. Gurney," 
said the matron; "but <i>this</i> I know, that
nothing, in my opinion, can be more unwise,
than bringing two people together without fortune, 
and entailing upon them a life of perpetual
embarrassment and worry."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

<p>"You are wrong my dear," said mine host.
"Where there is genius or talent, the very fact
of having a fond and affectionate wife dependent 
upon him for existence, is an excitement
to a man to exert his energies, baffle the
waves of opposing ills, and, by 'opposing, end
them.' "</p>

<p>Thinks I to myself, that <i>may</i> be very true;
but if I saw a wife so depending upon <i>me</i>, the
very thought of the precariousness of her position, 
and the regret for having removed her
from competency to share my difficulties, would
unnerve and unfit me for the exertions it would
be my duty to make. Harriet took no part in
the conversation, but appeared entirely absorbed
in the delicate and difficult task of peeling a
peach.</p>

<p>"I confess," continued Mrs. Wells, who was
as obstinate as Echo in the particular of having
the last word, "I see no good in preaching what
nobody in their senses would practise."</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> say, Gurney?" said Mr.
Wells.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

<p>"Why, Sir," said I,&mdash;and I was rather
flurried by the question,&mdash;"I&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose, now," said Wells, "a girl of eighteen
or nineteen&mdash;more or less, as the case may be&mdash;had 
won your heart, and you had won hers,&mdash;should 
you stop to consider whether you could
live upon so much a year, or so much more, or&mdash;as 
I said before&mdash;less? I know you would not."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," said I, "Love seldom calculates. 
He is painted blind. I never have
thought upon the subject; but of this I am quite
sure, that, whatever love without money may
be, money without love is destruction."</p>

<p>"I told you so, Sarah," exclaimed mine host.
"Few young hearts are mercenary&mdash;a woman's
heart never is, as I firmly believe. She will
squander and waste to the right and to the left;
and she will make her husband give <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, and
parties, and dinners, and <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ners</i>, and all the
rest of it; but a selfish, stingy woman is a <i>rara
avis</i>."</p>

<p>"Better be stingy, Mr. Wells," said Sarah,
"as you call it, than extravagant. More

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

fortunes have been saved than made; and I
hate to hear you talk in so unguarded a way
while persons are present who certainly ought
not to listen to such principles."</p>

<p>"Sally, my love," said Wells, who was somewhat 
taken aback by his wife's reproof, "I
never say what I do not mean, and I live with
my children as I do with my friends. If
my words were not in accordance with my
thoughts, I should not argue as I <i>have</i> done; as
they are, and as I have no concealments, I speak
out, and I should think myself the most unhappy
father in the world, if I thought a daughter of
mine could be spoiled by a misinterpretation of
my sentiments."</p>

<p>"As for your daughters being spoiled," said
Mrs. Wells significantly, "I do not pretend to
say anything about it; but I think we may as
well retire. Come, Harriet, it is quite time for
bed."</p>

<p>Harriet, who had taken no share in the conversation, 
looked at her father and then at me.
Wells saw that his wife was what might be

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

called out of humour about something, and
seemed to me to be resolved, in spite of his
former brag about the Dunmow flitch, to have
his own way.</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah, dear," exclaimed he, "are
you going to bed without your negus? my poor
girl too has had nothing in the world to eat or
to drink."</p>

<p>"Nothing for me. Pa," said the innocent girl,
with an expression of fear of Ma's anger.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> want nothing more, Mr. Wells," said the
old lady; "I cannot bear to hear nonsense."</p>

<p>"Well, love," replied her husband, "we
won't quarrel for the first time in our lives about
nonsense&mdash;it would be nonsense if we did; so,
Harriet, ring the bell, and let us have in our
accustomed hot water, sugar, and the <i>et ceteras</i>.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>What a fellow that Shakspeare was, Gurney!

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

No circumstance can occur, no occasion present
itself, but his words&mdash;prophetic and inspired as
they are&mdash;become more applicable, more to the
point, than any other we can find."</p>

<p>"Even when perverted," said I; and when I
turned my head to meet the wonted gentle
smile of Harriet, I saw a tear trickling down
her cheek. What had caused it? something
her mother had looked, no doubt, for she had
said nothing. I felt extremely uncomfortable,
and repented not having gone "on the first
intention," as surgeons say of the healing
of a wound. I never had been placed in so
unpleasant a situation during the whole course
of my acquaintance with the family; it was a
release when the servant obeyed the injunction
he had received, and disturbed the awkward
silence which followed my last attempt to make
conversation, by the noise he created in putting
down the glasses, and bottles, and decanters,
and jugs of hot and cold water, with which it was
the custom to decorate the table at Mr. Wells's,
at that period of the evening.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

<p>Mrs. Wells, however, was not to be soothed;
she would drink no negus, and she <i>would</i> go to
bed. Harriet, who was conscious of no offence,
and who found herself supported by, I believe,
her favourite parent, gave a gentle affirmative
to her father's inquiry whether she would have
some wine and water: this seemed to increase
Mrs. Wells's ill-humour, who, pushing her chair
from the table, rose from her seat, and said in
a most awful tone, "Well, <i>I</i> am going to bed;"
and, in order to put this determination into immediate 
practice, proceeded to the table in the
corner of the room, whereon were deposited the
chamber candlesticks, for the purpose of procuring 
a light. I saved her the trouble, lighted
her candle, and presented it to her; she did not
thank me, but that, as we were old friends, I
did not much care about; but, looking at Harriet, 
she said, in a most discordant tone, "I
suppose, Miss, you will not be long after
me?"</p>

<p>This unsettled my poor girl, who was about

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

to swallow her whole glass of wine and water at
a gulp, and accompany her exemplary mother,
when Wells interposing, said, "When she is
tired of our society, she will go. Sit still, Harriet&mdash;finish 
your wine and water&mdash;if you are
not sleepy, stay where you are."</p>

<p>I saw the look which Mrs. Wells gave her
husband after this speech; it was full of reproach; 
it seemed to say, "That's right, Mr.
Wells, teach your daughter to disregard her
mother." He evidently understood it as I did,
and when she quitted the room, which she
did with an air of indignant grandeur, Wells
jumped up and followed her. Harriet then
seemed most anxious to follow them; <i>that
I</i> prevented.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are not going?" said I.</p>

<p>"I think I had better go," replied Harriet,
"I am afraid Papa's angry."</p>

<p>"I am sure Mamma is," said I; "but don't
you think it would be better to let them settle
their little differences by themselves? Besides,

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

if you go, I must, and I have no intention
of moving for this hour; your father has
not yet commenced what he calls his 'brewing.' "</p>

<p>"I cannot think what has happened to put
my mother so much out of humour," said
Harriet.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said I, "except that perhaps she
thinks I kept you out too late in the air; however, 
if that be all, I shall have few opportunities 
of repeating the offence."</p>

<p>"But are you really going so soon?" said
Harriet.</p>

<p>"I must," replied I; "besides all other reasons, 
one seems paramount; I came down to
this neighbourhood to stay with my friends the
Nubleys, and from the first week I made your
acquaintance, I have only been four evenings at
their house, unless they had company."</p>

<p>"But you <i>will</i> stay for the ball?" said
Harriet.</p>

<p>"If you wish it."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Harriet, "it makes no difference 

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

to <i>me;</i> only you promised Miss Illingworth, 
and&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is decided, Harriet," interrupted I; "I
stay."</p>

<p>"There's a dear good brother," said Harriet;
"but isn't my father gone a long time?"</p>

<p>"I do not think so," said I; "if he were to
stay ten times as long, so that you did not follow
him, I shouldn't care."</p>

<p>"No," answered she, "nor I, if I did not
think that some unpleasant feeling existed between&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the gentle heart of the affectionate 
daughter was relieved of all its apprehensions 
by the return of her "Pa," humming
one of his favourite tunes as he came across
the hall, and who entered the room smiling as
the dawn.</p>

<p>"My old lady is a little out of humour," said
he, resuming his seat, "about Harriet's staying
out so late; however, I have set all that to
rights&mdash;it is all sunshine now&mdash;and so now for
my toddy."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

<p>"I am sure," said his daughter, "if Mamma
disapproves of it, I will never offend again&mdash;I
hope she is quite sure of that&mdash;indeed I shall
have no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was on thorns&mdash;she was going to say&mdash;I
knew she was&mdash;"no inducement to stop looking
at the moon after to-morrow;" luckily she did
not conclude her sentence, for the exemplary
toddy-maker stopped her short in her quite
needless explanation, by repeating, "Sure of
that? aye, that she is&mdash;so am I&mdash;say no more
about it, dear.&mdash;Gurney, some grog?&mdash;come,
no ceremony, help yourself&mdash;push the sugar to
him, Harriet&mdash;make yourself useful&mdash;as I say,
Gurney, I hate your automatons&mdash;&mdash;everything
in its time&mdash;all things in their season&mdash;I like
to see <i>my</i> girls useful as well as ornamental."</p>

<p>I confess I was not quite of that opinion&mdash;I
hated to see women do anything but sit still and
hear their own praises; even the exertion necessary 
to the display of accomplishments I considered 
too great for the delicate creatures who

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

adorn the world. However, I made a sort of
affirmative noise, and Harriet, who seemed to
foresee a lengthened sitting, from the joyous
and social temper of her father, made what is
called a move; she went through the ceremonies 
previously observed by her respected mother, 
and I performed the same offices regarding 
the candle as I had executed for the elder
lady, the only difference being, that when,
instead of a cross repulsive frown which Mrs.
Wells had bestowed upon me in return, I received 
one of Harriet's gentlest and sweetest 
smiles, my little finger somehow became
strangely entangled with hers in the handle of
the candlestick&mdash;I extricated it, and we shook
hands&mdash;she kissed her father's forehead and
cheek, and retired. Little did I anticipate the
sequel.</p>

<p>"That's as good a girl as ever lived, Gurney," 
said her father, as she shut the door&mdash;"help 
yourself&mdash;she has not a fault that I know
of."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

<p>I bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Are you really going to leave us?" said he;
"you find us dull&mdash;what are you going to do
after you return to town?"</p>

<p>I told him my future plans, and we were insensibly 
drawn into a lengthened conversation, which
lasted upwards of an hour, as it subsequently
proved; during which time we had drunk a very
considerable quantity of whisky toddy, which
my excellent host had undertaken to make, not
only for himself, but me. I had called a halt
with the brandy and water, which he advised
me never to drink weak, as deleterious; and
after that, upon his earnest persuasion, I submitted 
myself to be toddyized according to his
will and pleasure.</p>

<p>It was about one o'clock in the morning. I
recollect the candles on the table had grown
very short, and the wicks remarkably long,
when, while preparing my third tumbler, Mr.
Wells recurred to what, it was clear, was a very
favourite subject.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Gurney, you don't marry," said

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

he; "rely upon it, as I said at supper, there
is nothing gives a man a place in the world
so respectably as an early marriage&mdash;just taste
that; is it strong enough? no, a leetle drop
more&mdash;it settles a man&mdash;is it good?"</p>

<p>"Excellent," said I, sipping what appeared
to me to be aqua-fortis and sugar, but which,
from its colourless appearance, looked as weak
as water.</p>

<p>"Have you ever turned the subject over
in your mind?" said Wells&mdash;"ever seriously
thought of fixing?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I have," said I&mdash;and the faces
and figures of Miss Emma Haines, and Mrs.
Fletcher Green, flitted before my eyes&mdash;"but
I see no chance, even if I resolved upon the
measure, of realizing my wish."</p>

<p>"Why so, Gilbert? why so?&mdash;you don't
drink, man, eh&mdash;why so?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Sir," said I, "I have no
fortune adequate to the support of an establishment, 
and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fortune!" said mine host, swallowing a

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

comfortable draught of his own mixture&mdash;"what
has fortune to do with it? You have a profession, 
if you choose to follow it; as a single man
you have no need of more income than you
have, and therefore you do not pursue it; if
you had a wife, you would."</p>

<p>"I might," said I, "but there are very few parents, 
I suspect, who would permit me to marry
their daughters upon such a principle."</p>

<p>"I differ with you there, Gurney," said Mr.
Wells; "my notion is, give a girl a good husband&mdash;and 
I call a clever, honourable man a
good husband&mdash;hang the money,&mdash;give her a
good husband, the man whom she loves, and
all will go well: it will be all sunshine, and
shine the sun does, alike upon the cottage and
the palace."</p>

<p>"It is not every man who entertains such
liberal principles as you do," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, but what does that matter?" replied
my friend. "Come,&mdash;come, finish that glass,
and let me make you another&mdash;look! don't you
see I have finished mine, eh? What, as I say,

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

signifies that? One parent of these opinions is
enough, if that parent finds one young man of
his way of thinking. Now, for instance, supposing 
any man were to make an offer to my
dear child, Harriet,&mdash;the sweetest girl in the
world <i>I</i> think&mdash;a treasure to any human being
who may be happy enough to win her,&mdash;if she
liked him and said Aye, do you think I should
say No, because he was not rich? Give me
your tumbler."</p>

<p>Saying which, he replenished the huge vessel
which I had thrice emptied.</p>

<p>"But perhaps," continued he, "Harriet is not
after <i>your</i> taste, and you would say in reply to
my observation, that it was quite natural I should
be glad to take the first that came&mdash;but that is
not the case. Harriet has not been unwooed,
although she has not yet, that I know of, been
won. Of course, opinions on such matters differ;
and although I think her everything that is
amiable, you may not."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir," said I, with sincere warmth,
"I have the highest opinion of Miss Wells;

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

nobody can admire her more than I do; nobody
can more justly appreciate her excellent qualities."</p>

<p>" 'Pon your life!" said Wells; "really&mdash;are
you serious? Why then&mdash;why the deuce don't
you come to the point?&mdash;you know <i>my</i> feelings
on the subject&mdash;why not marry her?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, startled at the course the conversation 
had taken, and seeing through a sort
of halo round the candles two Messrs. Wells
sitting opposite to me, "I never ventured to
allow myself to think of such a thing. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why not, my dear friend?" said he&mdash;"have 
you tasted the new glass, eh?&mdash;come,
you don't like it&mdash;taste and try, eh? Why not
think of Harriet, hey?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," said I, in a faltering tone, "if I
ever did think upon the subject, it would be
absurd in me to put forward my pretensions&mdash;she 
would never consent."</p>

<p>"Do you think not, Gilbert?" exclaimed he,
"then I think very differently&mdash;I do, by Jove&mdash;I 

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

think she is very fond of you; and I think
that the cause of my old lady's snappishness to-night 
is her having made the discovery. I can
see through a mill-stone as well as my neighbours&mdash;I 
could have told her that myself a fortnight 
ago&mdash;but what does it matter? why should
I interfere? I said to myself, if Harriet like
Gilbert, and Gilbert like Harriet, I am sure I
have no objection, eh?&mdash;come, you don't drink."</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "I really am not conscious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Conscious," said Wells; "come, none of
your nonsense. Old birds, Master Gilbert, are
not to be caught with chaff. Do you make me
believe, that either my girl or you care three
straws what the moon is made of? or that when
you go out in the garden astronomizing, you
look at any stars but her eyes? No, no&mdash;the
fact is, she is very fond of you, and you are very
fond of her."</p>

<p>"I have already expressed my opinion of
Harriet," said I, "and certainly am not disposed 
to retract a word I have said."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

<p>"You are a good fellow," said Wells; "a
fine, honourable fellow; and I like to hear you
call her Harriet."</p>

<p>"You are too kind," continued I; "but whatever 
those feelings may be, I am quite sure it
would be useless for me to expect a return."</p>

<p>"Useless!" interrupted he; "why useless?
I tell you the girl is over head and ears in love
with you. Now, that's the truth."</p>

<p>"In that case," said I, "my happiness would
be complete."</p>

<p>"Would it?" exclaimed the animated father;
"then, by Jove, you shall secure immediate
felicity. Wait a moment&mdash;finish your toddy.
You shall have the confession from her own
lips."</p>

<p>"The ladies are gone to bed," said I, somewhat 
startled at the promptitude of his proceeding.</p>

<p>"No matter," replied he, lighting his candle,
"nothing like the time present&mdash;strike while
the iron's hot. We'll see who's right&mdash;finish

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

your toddy&mdash;that's all. I'll be back in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>And away he went, sure enough, leaving me
in a sort of maze&mdash;a kind of wonderment, at
what possibly could have brought about the
event which had just occurred, and what would
be the next step in the proceeding.</p>

<p>In a minute, I heard my excellent friend in
the room overhead&mdash;his own bed-chamber;&mdash;a
slight murmuring followed his arrival; presently,
I heard the sound of feet pattering and paddling
over the floor; then I heard them along a lobby,
at the end of which was Harriet's apartment.
Everything was still&mdash;it was two o'clock in the
morning. I heard the door of her room open&mdash;I 
heard my friend again in his own room; then
I heard some more scuffling and pattering about,
and the door of Harriet's room shut&mdash;and then
came a pause, and a murmuring&mdash;and I finished
my glass of toddy. I could not go away, for
Wells said he was coming back again. What I
was to stay for I knew not; yet, in that jocose

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

vein in which I indulged in other days, I contented 
myself with quoting Gay, in a whisper,
and muttered&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"The wretch of tod<i>dy</i> may be happy to-morrow."</p>

</div>

<p>Little did I think how close at hand my happiness 
was.</p>

<p>I had&mdash;what with listening and wondering&mdash;fallen 
into a purgatorial state of intermediacy
between sleeping and waking, when I was recalled 
to the entire possession of my senses
(under the operation, always be it understood,
of the happy compound which my excellent host
had so admirably made, and so liberally administered), 
by the opening of the dinner-room door,
and the appearance of Mr. Wells, of Mrs. Wells,
and of Miss Wells; the two latter evidently in a
state of amiable dishabille,&mdash;the elder lady looking 
excessively good-natured, and the younger
one seeming ready to sink under the effects of
her extraordinary re-appearance in the parlour.
I instinctively rose&mdash;reeled a little round&mdash;saved
myself, by catching the back of my chair&mdash;and

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

saw, what I never expected to see, two Harriets:
as this duplication had previously occurred with
regard to her respectable father, I was a good
deal puzzled.</p>

<p>"Sit down, dear Gilbert," said Wells. "Sally,
my love," continued he, addressing his better
half, "Gilbert has declared his feelings towards
Harriet&mdash;Who's right now, old lady?&mdash;He loves
her, and she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Papa," said poor Miss Wells, "what
<i>do</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean all that is good," replied Wells.
"Sarah, my love, let us step into the drawing-room 
for a few minutes, and Gilbert will tell her
what <i>he</i> means."</p>

<p>"I mean, Sir," said I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know what you mean, my dear fellow&mdash;you 
have told me that already," said Papa.
"Ask <i>her</i> the question&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"And don't be long, Mr. Gurney," said Mrs.
Wells, "for I am afraid the poor dear girl will
catch cold."</p>

<p>And, having made their speeches, this respectable 

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

couple disappeared in a moment. I winked
my eyes&mdash;they were gone&mdash;I concluded through
the door-way; but, for all I saw of their exit,
they might have gone up the chimney. When
they were fairly out of the room, Harriet&mdash;who
seemed to me to be quite aware of my extraordinary 
and unusual elevation of spirits&mdash;said,
in her gentlest tone of voice, "What does
all this mean, Gilbert&mdash;why have you sent for
me?&mdash;I am only half awake&mdash;but it does seem
most extraordinary&mdash;why are we here?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said I, endeavouring to
see through what appeared to be a thick fog, and
trying to speak plain, despite of what seemed
some grievous impediment, "I don't know, Harriet; 
your father&mdash;&mdash;,"&mdash;there I faltered, and
she began to cry. I "mooned" out, that my
sympathetic ignorance of the object of our
dialogue had wounded her feelings&mdash;I would
not have given her a moment's pain for a gold mine. 
"Your father," I resumed, "told me
that&mdash;&mdash;," hereabouts I forgot what he <i>had</i> told

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

me, "that&mdash;if I were to&mdash;offer myself to you as
a husband&mdash;you would not refuse me."</p>

<p>The look she gave me I never shall forget&mdash;it 
was like the sun clearing away the morning
mist: there was a mixture of pleasure&mdash;of surprise&mdash;of 
doubt&mdash;of melancholy, in the expression 
of her countenance, well suited to our
extraordinary position&mdash;she gazed at me for a
moment steadily.</p>

<p>"Gilbert," said she, sobbing, "I am sure you
have too much honour, too much kindness, too
much feeling, to say this if you are not in earnest;
is it for this I have been brought here? What
can I say? Oh! my wild, thoughtless father&mdash;my 
pride&mdash;my&mdash;what does it mean&mdash;I am sure
you would not trifle with me?"</p>

<p>How could I?&mdash;a warm-hearted, amiable,
excellent girl; and oh! how like volcanoes
covered with snow are the cold-mannered, placid,
quiet creatures, whose fire is all within! She
was alone with me&mdash;her feelings excited&mdash;my 
affection brought out, like the doubtful

<!-- vol 3 page 181 -->

colouring of some suspected master, by the
varnish of Wells's whisky&mdash;the result was inevitable.</p>

<p>"Harriet," said I, catching her round the waist,
and "sealing," after my usual fashion, the preliminaries 
on her lips, "your father is mistaken,
you will not&mdash;I know you will not&mdash;accept me!"</p>

<p>She said not a word. Her head dropped on
my shoulder, and her hand rested in mine. I
sealed again&mdash;the door opened, and in walked
Mr. and Mrs. Wells!</p>

<p>"I told you so, Gilbert&mdash;I told you so," said
Wells. Harriet disentangled herself from my
bold embrace, and, followed by Mrs. Wells,
quitted the room; not, however, before the
elderly lady had patted my head in a most
flattering manner.</p>

<p>"I told you so, Gurney," said Wells. "Come,
one more glass&mdash;health, happiness, and prosperity&mdash;son-in-law, 
pledge me!"</p>

<p>By the ingenious contrivance of a spirit-lamp
under his huge silver kettle, Wells retained
enough of the caloric to keep it up at a proper

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

temperature, even though the servants were
gone to bed. I bowed assent, for I confess I
was rather overcome; and we commenced our
fresh and last glass standing, or rather sitting,
in an extremely different relation to each other
from that on which we stood earlier in the evening, 
when Harriet and I were on the gravel 
walk, talking about the moon, and my reverend
friend was in the <i>bosquet</i>, listening to us.</p>

<p>The conversation did not flow rapidly or
freely; the "Of course, Gilbert, you will come
to breakfast!" sounded more like a claim than
an invitation&mdash;a result, rather than an impulse;
and as for talking of Harriet, now irrevocably
my own, it seemed to me a matter of impossibility. 
Wells once or twice patted my shoulder,
and once took my hand into his, and sipped a
sort of paternal "God bless you, my boy," to
which I replied in the same spirit; and so we
went on until it was three o'clock, and the sun,
which had set while I was yet wholly disengaged&mdash;a 
Platonic friend of Miss Wells&mdash;a bachelor,
free as a bee, to sip and rove, and rove and sip&mdash;had 

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

risen upon me, a pledged and accepted
lover. It seemed strange&mdash;rather pleasant, but
extremely wrong; however, I thought silence
the safest course, and therefore held my tongue;
and when I was quietly "let out" by my intended 
father-in-law, to make my way to the
house of my neglected and much-injured friends,
with whom I fancied myself staying, he gave
me just such a pat on the shoulder as his exemplary 
lady had bestowed upon my head, and I
found myself, in a bright summer morning,
measuring the breadth, rather than the length,
of my road to Nubley's hospitable mansion.</p>

<p>This may hereafter seem improbable and unnatural, 
but, nevertheless, it is true&mdash;it is a fact&mdash;an 
incident which, as will appear in the sequel,
led to many others. I confess, as I wended my
way from Wells's, I began to reflect and to
think, but with that sort of maudlin wisdom with
which men are uniformly possessed under similar
circumstances. However, I wound up all my
calculations with one conclusive remark made
to myself, but in audible voice&mdash;"What is done,

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

cannot be undone&mdash;Harriet is mine for ever!"
and I clasped my hands, and stamped my feet,
as I went along, as if she were there, and saw
and heard me.</p>

<p>I reached Chittagong Lodge&mdash;the family
had been buried in sleep for hours&mdash;I felt
ashamed at being so late, and when I slipped
and stumbled up the staircase, consoled myself
with thinking that I was doing it on purpose. I
entered my room, and threw myself on the bed;
and there I lay, overcome by sleep and fatigue
of mind&mdash;nor did I wake until my servant came
to fetch my clothes, when I was disturbed by
the noise he made, and found myself, at nine
o'clock in the morning, recumbent on the quilt,
dressed as I was, when I came home, and betrothed 
to Miss Harriet Wells.</p>

<p>When the man had left the room, evidently
very much astonished at finding me as I was, I
began to revolve in my mind the events which
had occurred during the past evening and night.
I perfectly recollected the extraordinary scene
which had been performed, and felt conscious

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

of the responsibility which I had taken upon
myself&mdash;nor was I, in the slightest degree,
affected by it; because I was sure that Harriet
was a loveable creature, and that, after all, as
Mr. Wells had said, matrimony did give a man a
place and respectability; and that I should be
delighted, whenever the moon shone, to walk
about with my dear blue-eyed girl, and look at
it, and talk about it; and then she was such an
affectionate daughter, there could be no doubt
but she would make a kind, dutiful wife; and
she was such a kind sister, that she must make a
tender mother, and so on; and I was charmed
with the prospect, until I began to consider,
what I always had considered before when in
my sober senses, the power of three hundred
and ninety pounds a-year to afford those comforts, 
not to say luxuries of life, which a well-bred 
woman absolutely requires.</p>

<p>"Of course," said I to myself, "as I never
made any disguise of the smallness of my income,
Mr. Wells must intend to put us at least beyond
the difficulties of the world; and if he contributes

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

an equal sum to my own income, I <i>do</i> think,
with management, something like eight hundred
a-year will do&mdash;a cottage&mdash;a cow&mdash;and content;
nothing can be more charming, and more rational." 
And so, by the time I had changed my
costume, in order to breakfast with "the family,"
I had worked myself up into the belief that the
thing would answer; always, however, with a
<i>proviso</i>, that the events which I had registered
in my mind of the previous evening had not
occurred in a dream, instead of being realities.</p>

<p>I scarcely knew how to excuse myself from
Mr. and Mrs. Nubley at breakfast: however, as
the thing was done, in the course of the day I
should be able to make one general apology for
my apparent ill-breeding, in passing so much of
my time at the Wellses'; and I resolved to make
my retreat as early as possible, so as to avoid the
questions of my kind host, or the significant
looks of his lady, who, I knew, was perfectly
aware of that of which I myself was utterly unconscious,&mdash;namely, 
that I had been caught.
Harriet was an interesting creature, and that is

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

the truth of it, and Mrs. Nubley was too cunning
in such matters not to see what was going on.
What may be thought of Mr. Wells's conduct,
I know not; but I have seriously reflected
upon it very frequently since. However, it
was <i>une affaire finie</i>, and so away I went,
looking like a simpleton, and feeling like a
fool, to be received in his house as the affianced
husband of his darling daughter.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I reached my reverend father-in-law's
residence,&mdash;I felt a sensation to which I had,
up to that period, been a stranger. The reality
of the last night's proceedings, which came over
me in a sort of cold shiver, at finding myself
all at once as it were, one of a family of which I
knew but little, and of which, however generally
agreeable, some of the members might, for
all I knew, be unfavourably distinguished by
some unpleasant circumstance which had not yet
reached my ears, made me rather nervous. But
this was nothing compared to what I experienced 
when I went into the billiard-room and
found Harriet there. I could not define the

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

sentiment which occupied and overcame me.
There she was; her eyes beaming with their
usual softness, her bosom heaving, the colour
flickering on her cheeks, and her pretty ringlets 
flowing over her snowy forehead as usual;
but the thing that struck me as so excessively
odd was, that they were all mine,&mdash;that <i>she</i> was
mine&mdash;my own,&mdash;and that I might press her
in my arms, and feel her heart beat, and kiss
away the tear which glistened in her eye, and
twist and untwist her curls just as I pleased,
with nobody on earth to find fault with me. I
felt just as if I had bought a new toy at a very
large price. It was very agreeable; yet somehow 
the zest of the thing was gone,&mdash;I had
caught my hare,&mdash;the chase was over,&mdash;doubts
and fears, if I ever had any, were ended,&mdash;and
the future Mrs. Gurney came bounding to meet
me, evidently expecting that sort of welcome
which I was much too well-bred to refuse her:
but it was <i>so</i> odd!&mdash;four-and-twenty hours before, 
she would have frowned at me and looked
cross, if I had caught her in my arms. I do

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

not think she would have cried out, but she
would have <i>seemed</i> to be angry; and now,
simply because I had imbibed two or three extra
glasses of whisky-punch with her reverend
father the night before, there she was, as kind
and as coming as could be!</p>

<p>I was very much at a loss for a subject of
conversation. I had never carried my amativeness, 
upon any former occasion, to so advanced
a stage, and I did not know exactly what I
could now say to interest her. Of course making
professions or declarations would be superfluous.
I had already made the last and most decisive
declaration man <i>can</i> make, and one which it
was quite clear I should not have made if I
had not been devoted to her. I thought the
best thing I could do was to walk her out into
the garden, and give her a little exercise before
breakfast. I proposed a stroll, and she of course
assented,&mdash;and there we roved and rambled, I
with my arm encircling her taper waist, and not
saying one syllable. We were what the truly
poetic call, lost in the ecstasy of our own feelings,

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

and we did nothing but sigh and look at each
other, except that I occasionally pressed her
closer to my side&mdash;the side on which my heart
lay, and that, whenever I did so, she affectedly
turned her head the other way, and muttered,
"don't."</p>

<p>It is very wrong, I dare say, to put such a
fact to paper, but I do honestly declare that
I felt as if I had done something extremely
foolish, if not absolutely wrong, in permitting
Mr. Wells to bring the affair to so speedy a
conclusion. What the deuce was I to do with a
wife now I had got one? I had never spoken
of her fortune, for I never cared about money;
but, supposing, with all his eloquent flourishes
about liberality, and independence, and all the
rest of it, the Rev. Mr. Wells had neither the
inclination nor the ability to give Harriet anything 
by way of portion, what was to be done?
And then, when children came&mdash;as come they
naturally would&mdash;matters would be worse. I
really was not happy. I felt something like a
fly in a honey-pot, over head and ears in sweets,

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

but terribly puzzled how to get out of the scrape
into which it was quite clear I had gotten
myself.</p>

<p>Somehow I did not quite admire the alteration 
in Harriet's manner. I became restless and
fidgety. I saw faults in her which I had not
previously observed; and all at once I said to
myself, "Dear me, dear me, and this is the
being to whom I am to cleave for life, who is to
be my companion eternally, and to be taken
with me wherever I go! I wonder how she
would look in a London drawing-room, and
what people would think and say of her!"
And then I suddenly dropped from this train
of wonderment and sensitive delicacy, into a
desponding course of reflection that, in all probability, 
with our pecuniary means, we should
neither of us have an opportunity of exhibiting
ourselves in the higher circles, unless they
chanced to be the higher <i>circles</i> of the play-houses.</p>

<p>Harriet saw that my mind was occupied with
various thoughts, and perhaps wondered that I

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

did not somehow touch upon the fact of our
nuptials, or express an ardent anxiety for
naming the day. It may seem very strange,
but for the life of me I could not allude to the
subject. Once or twice I thought she was
going to say something about it herself, or
about the scene of the preceding night, and
whenever she seemed going to speak, I had
recourse to my happy expedient, of giving her
a gentle squeeze, and drawing her towards me,
which had the immediate effect of checking her
observation, and inducing her to say "don't,"
and turn away her head.</p>

<p>The seasonable appearance of Mrs. Wells
and the two younger girls, put a period to the
most embarrassing <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in which I had
ever been engaged. The old lady&mdash;I mean
the mother of Harriet, for old she was not,
except by comparison&mdash;was all smiles and good
humour; and Fanny, who had evidently been
made acquainted with all the occurrences of the
preceding evening, gave me a look which I
shall never forget,&mdash;indeed there was so much

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

of archness about it, that I thought to myself I
had never seen her look either so pretty or so
intellectual before.</p>

<p>"Our papa is but just up," said Miss
Wells.</p>

<p>"Our papa!"</p>

<p>"You gave him too much whisky-punch,
Gilbert, last night," said Mrs. Wells.</p>

<p>"He helped himself," said I.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> too," said Harriet, with a look
which I did <i>not</i> like.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "It is seldom that I am
betrayed into such excesses. I scarcely recollect
how I got home."</p>

<p>"I saw no symptoms of your excess," said
Mrs. Wells, "when we last parted. It must
have been after <i>that</i>, if you did exceed."</p>

<p>I saw the drift of all this; but I affected blindness, 
and complained of a headache.</p>

<p>"That accounts for your dullness," said
Harriet.</p>

<p>"I am not conscious," said I, "that I am
dull. I have been thinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

<p>"Quite right, too, Gilbert," said Mrs. Wells.
"The cares of the world are coming upon you
now; it is quite right to think."</p>

<p>"What cares, Ma'?" said Fanny, bursting
out into a most unseemly laugh.</p>

<p>Harriet coloured crimson, and fired one of
the fiercest frowns she could command at sister
Fanny.</p>

<p>"Fanny, dear," said her mother, who seemed
to think that I should disapprove of the expedition 
with which the intelligence of my capture 
had been spread through the family, "run
in and see if Mr. Wells is down stairs yet; he
told me he should be ready for breakfast in a
quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>And away went the laughing Fan.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Wells, "that papa
and you will want to have a long <i>cause</i> this
morning, and I think it will be as well if I and
the girls go and call upon the Nubleys."</p>

<p>"When is the ball, Harriet?" said I.</p>

<p>"To-morrow night," replied the future Mrs.
Gurney.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

<p>"And I am to dance with Miss Illingworth?"
asked I.</p>

<p>"To be sure, if you please," replied Miss
Wells, evidently piqued.</p>

<p>"You told me it was an engagement," said I.</p>

<p>"To be sure!" replied Harriet. "And I am
engaged to dance with Lieutenant Merman of
the 45th every dance for the evening." These
words were enunciated in a most determined
manner, and their delivery was succeeded by a
burst of tears.</p>

<p>I did not know that I had done anything to
outrage my little wife's feelings; but, from what
I saw, it seemed that the change in my position
which had been wrought in six or seven hours
was most extraordinary.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Mrs. Wells, "my dear
Harriet, you are not engaged to Lieutenant
Merman, or whatever you call him, in any such
way."</p>

<p>"Well, Ma," said Harriet, "if I am not, I
might be, and may be if I like; and if Gilbert
goes and dances with that odious Miss Illingworth, 

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

I have just as much right to dance with
Henry."</p>

<p>This statement of rights I confess did not
please me; nor did I admire Miss Illingworth's
being called odious, in whose praise and cause
Harriet had been, the night before, most eloquent; 
neither did I admire the familiar manner 
in which she spoke of the gallant Lieutenant 
as Henry.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Harriet," said I, "I have no
wish to dance with Miss Illingworth, nor
should I ever have thought of such a thing,
had you not told me that I ought to do so; and
in order to oblige <i>you</i>, I proposed fulfilling
what you represented to me to be my promise."</p>

<p>"I might have said so yesterday," said
Harriet; "but circumstances are changed.
Miss Illingworth can't think you have any
serious intentions with regard to her now; and,
for my part, <i>I</i> would rather not go to the ball
at all."</p>

<p>"What!" said I, "and abandon Henry?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells, who saw that there were certain

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

clouds rising in the horizon, thought it wisest
to put an end to this little discussion, in which
Harriet's temper did not appear to quite so much
advantage as it might have done, and hurried
us towards the house, where the ever-volatile
Wells was ready to receive us.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells was a specimen of the order to
which he belonged, by no means favourable as
regards its sacred character, but he was an
excessively pleasant person, and always contrived 
to make his house agreeable, and his
visitors not only pleased with himself and his
family, but, which is infinitely more satisfactory,
pleased with themselves. I saw his failings; I
disliked the levity with which he occasionally
treated serious subjects; I was aware that his
practice was not in accordance with his preaching, 
and I saw several venial faults in his general
character, but I felt quite sure that he had a
very high opinion of <i>me</i>, and that he never was
so well pleased as when <i>I</i> was his guest. So, I
believe, thought every one of his ordinary acquaintances.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

<p>"Gilbert, how are you after the punch, eh?"
cried the reverend Bacchanalian. "Well, I
hope?&mdash;Punch of my brewing is always wholesome,&mdash;not 
a headache in a hogshead of it. Give
us your hand. I am delighted to see you.
Harriet, kiss me, dearest: I presume I am not
the first so favoured on this auspicious morning?"</p>

<p>Harriet looked towards me, I thought somewhat 
reproachfully, as if she thought my ardour
had not been quite so conspicuous as it might
have been.</p>

<p>"Come, old lady," continued the pastor,
"give us our breakfast. Fanny, love, how dost
do? Where's my little Betsy,&mdash;my Bettina?"</p>

<p>And hereabouts Fanny and her plump junior
saluted their reverend sire, who speedily ensconced 
himself in his armed chair; and as we all sat
down round the table, his face brightening with
an expression of extreme delight, he first
smacked his hands, and then rubbed them, and
then exclaimed, "Here we are,&mdash;a happy family
party!"</p>

<p>While the ungraceful process of egg-eating,

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

tongue-demolishing, and tea-drinking is going
on, it may not be amiss to give one anecdote of
my intended father-in-law which may serve to
throw some light upon his character. It seems
that, in the outset of his clerical career (for he
first started in life as a lawyer), he found it
difficult to get rid of his lay habits, and not
unfrequently an oath mingled in the volumes
of words which issued from his lips, added to
which he maintained an ancient custom of his,
of frequenting races, and betting to a considerable 
amount. These proceedings made some
noise in the village where his preferment lay,
and at length a complaint was lodged with his
diocesan, who, with the generosity and impartiality 
of a great and good man, resolved at
once to send for him, tell him what the allegations 
were, which were made against him, and
leave it to his own sense and feeling to correct
what in his new sacerdotal character was, in
point of fact, extremely censurable conduct.</p>

<p>Wells, somewhat flurried by the episcopal
summons, and judging, "conscience-stricken,"

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

that it originated in some complaint from his
parishioners, repaired to the Bishop's palace
with anything but agreeable feelings upon the
occasion. He described to me the sort of
nervous agitation which he experienced while
pulling the heavy bell which was to summon
the porter to the prelate's gate. He consoled
himself, however, by the reflection, that all
unpleasant interviews are infinitely worse in
imagination than in reality, and sent in his name
with the resolution of one determined to bear
with meekness and resignation the infliction for
which he had, in truth, been a little prepared,
by the conversations which had, more than once
or twice, taken place in his neighbourhood between 
the more rigid of his flock, and which
had been repeated to him by some exceedingly
good-natured friends.</p>

<p>The Bishop, a man of exemplary piety of
character, and lamb-like meekness of manner,
received him with that sort of bland and paternal
kindness which a surgeon, who is about to cut
off the leg of a highly-distinguished patient,

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

exhibits to his victim,&mdash;a kind of encouraging
gentleness, which may strengthen him up to
bear the slashing cuts, which, for the salvation
of his life, he proposes in a few minutes after to
inflict upon him. He begged him to be seated;
hoped he had not inconvenienced him by requesting 
him to call, and hoped that Mrs. Wells
and his daughter&mdash;he then had but one&mdash;were
well. Wells felt soothed and re-assured, and
began almost to think that he had been mistaken 
in the object of his Lordship's letter, and
that, instead of a reprimand, he was going to
give him a stall in his cathedral. He was soon
undeceived.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wells," said the Bishop, "it is, of all
things in the world, the most unpleasant to
censure; and I do assure you, it is because I
have a high regard for you, and a high opinion
of you, that I have sent for you hither to say a
few words, which, I am quite sure,&mdash;at least if
I know anything of your real character,&mdash;will
obviate the necessity of any further steps on <i>my</i>
part. What I refer to are some reports which

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

have reached me, I can scarcely say officially,
but which have been forwarded to me by a
party in your parish, who incline, conscientiously, 
I am sure, to a more rigid course of
living than men of the world are generally apt
to pursue; and these persons throw out that an
evil impression is given to the parish by your
inconsiderately&mdash;I am sure&mdash;devoting a great
portion of your time to sporting matters, and a
habit of using, during such occupation, oaths to
a considerable extent. Now, my dear Mr.
Wells," said his Lordship, stopping my respectable 
father-in-law, who was about to interrupt
him, "be assured that no Bishop hates meddling 
with the private conduct of the subordinate
clergy of his diocese more than I; and it is not
in the character of diocesan, but of friend, that
I have taken this opportunity of warning you of
the existence of those opinions and feelings,
and of suggesting an alteration in the tone and
tendency of your recreations, which may effectually 
put a stop to such observations and
remarks."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

<p>"My Lord," said Wells, "I really have no
words to thank you for this kindness. I am
quite sensible of the errors which your Lordship
has so justly, so properly, and so considerately
pointed out to me. You are aware that I have
not long embraced the profession which I have
now chosen, and that habits of early days are
difficult to shake off, but rely upon it that from
this moment they end; you shall never again
have occasion to say one word upon the subject,
nor shall my enemies have an opportunity of
attracting your Lordship's attention to any levities 
of a similar character."</p>

<p>"Don't say another word," said the Bishop:
"I have treated you as a friend, and I rejoice to
see that you take my interference in good part.
I thought you would, and I have not been
deceived; and now, Mr. Wells," continued his
Lordship, "as our business is over, come into
the next room, and take some luncheon."</p>

<p>Wells described his delight at the mildness
and moderation of the Bishop's reproof, and
quite fascinated with the kind and hospitable

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

conduct which formed the sequel, he too gladly
accepted his Lordship's invitation, and a few
minutes more found them seated at a table, upon
which were placed dishes in sufficient number
and variety to deserve the name of dinner.</p>

<p>The conversation assumed a general character,
and the Bishop having set the example. Wells
drank one or two glasses of wine, the Bishop
telling him that, as far as <i>he</i> was concerned, <i>that</i>
was the only meal he enjoyed, the late dinners
of society not agreeing either with his appetite
or constitution. Wells found the prelate alive to
the mirth of his pleasant sallies, and encouraged
by his Lordship's smiles, went on describing a
variety of incidents and circumstances in his
happiest vein, until at last touching upon the
subject (which very much interested the particular 
quarter of the county in which his living
was situated) of a marriage said to be in agitation
between a certain Sir Harry Lackinfield and a
Miss Strombersley, a great heiress in those
parts, the Bishop said he was perfectly convinced 

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

it would take place before the next
Christmas.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, my Lord," said Wells, who
knew the match was off.</p>

<p>"I do," said the Bishop; "and I have tolerably 
good grounds for my belief."</p>

<p>"I'll be d&mdash;d," exclaimed Wells, "if I don't
bet your Lordship five to two that it never comes
off at all."</p>

<p>"As this, I presume," said the Bishop, rising
from table, "is to be the last bet you ever intend 
to make, I will not rob you by accepting
your offer, and leaving you without a chance of
revenge. Good morning, Sir; you have my
best wishes and sincere hopes of a desirable
change in your proceedings: the evident difficulty 
of correcting confirmed habits will, I am
sure, induce you to pay particular attention to
my friendly suggestions." Saying which, his
Lordship rang the bell, Mr. Wells descended the
stairs, mounted his horse, and rode home.</p>

<p>This little anecdote will pretty well serve to

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

explain the real character of Mr. Wells, who
although as far as I knew or could see, was not
chargeable with any flagrant impropriety, was, I
must admit, of a class of clergymen infinitely
more numerous in my younger days than since.
Within the last four-and-twenty years, the tone
of character and the manners of our spiritual
pastors and masters have undergone a most
striking and advantageous change. It sounds
odd, and even absurd to say so, but true it is, that
religion has become fashionable, and its cultivation 
and pursuits have taken place of what in
the days of our grandfathers were called spirit
and humour, which, in plain English, meant
profligacy and dissipation. No midnight broils
now break the public peace, no feats of drinking
are recorded in our periodical papers, as matters
of admiration. It is no longer thought brave to
beat the watch, nor considered extremely wise to
break the lamps: quiet lodgers are now never
roused from their slumbers by bell-ringings of the
"Tonsonian school," nor are waiters thrown out
of tavern windows, and charged in the bill.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

<p>To the mere off-scourings of society are these
performances now confined; indeed, so peculiarly 
marked are the few remaining professors of
such absurdities, that it is common to see posted
up by the parish authorities notices to "Lamp-breakers 
and others," thereby clearly proving
that such persons are a totally distinct race of
themselves.</p>

<p>If these outward signs of change in manners
are so evident, still more so are those by which
society, of a more refined character, is distinguished. 
Piety, charity, sympathy, and benevolence 
are its attributes, and the esteem and best
affections of those whose affections and esteem
are worth possessing, are acquired by the unaffected 
exercise of moral and religious duties, unaccompanied 
by the artificial and over-strained
puritanism which, not unfrequently, like its very
antipodes charity, "covers a multitude of sins."
In these days a profligate parson is an object of
hatred and contempt, and the same influence
which has worked the beneficial changes to which
I refer, has produced that general alteration in

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

social life which has sobered and chastened the
rakes and bullies of other times into accomplished 
gentlemen cultivating the arts and sciences, 
redeeming hours of agreeable and rational
conversation from the service of the bottle;
who see neither wit in immorality, nor wisdom
in profaneness; and yet perceive no crime in
mirth and gaiety, nor any gloom in the observances 
of religion.</p>

<p>I was led into these reflections by the account
which Mr. Wells gave me after breakfast, which
seemed to me to last longer than usual, of his
change of profession from the law to the Church,
and which he seemed resolved to confide to me,
together with some more minute particulars of
his early life, which, although strongly illustrative 
of my position as to the superior state of
public morality in later days, I do not think
would be either edifying or acceptable to the
reader of my notes, let him be whom he might.</p>

<p>"I was called to the Bar," said my reverend
friend, "knowing but little of law&mdash;went the
circuit&mdash;got no business;&mdash;never left the Hall

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

during term&mdash;got no business there&mdash;<i>in</i> town or
<i>out</i> of town just the same&mdash;wouldn't do. Went
next circuit, and there saw my inestimable
Sarah, then pretty, young, and amiable&mdash;with a
tolerable fortune, and niece to a bishop. I
made my offer&mdash;accepted by the young lady&mdash;frowned 
upon by the old."</p>

<p>My reverend father-in-law's case seemed
very like my own.</p>

<p>"I talked of industry," continued Wells, "and
argued earnestly on my yet favourite topic of
the stimulus to exertion, and my conviction of
happiness, content, and all <i>that</i>, till at last I got
a conditional hearing from Sally's mother, Mrs.
Grimsthorpe. She had spoken to her brother-in-law, 
the Bishop&mdash;he met me at dinner&mdash;I
spoke before him in a subdued tone. I was
then on promotion, and our meeting was followed 
by an interview, in which&mdash;not, perhaps,
very flattering to my talents&mdash;he told me very
candidly he did not think I should make much
figure at the Bar, but that if I made up my
mind to take orders, he would do whatever he

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

could&mdash;having no family of his own&mdash;to push
my interest.</p>

<p>"The proposition pleased me. I did not
stop to consider my fitness or unfitness for the
important change; all I looked at in the affair,
I saw as a lover sees, who is not quite blind,
except when his mistress is actually the object.
It was evident to me that I should never get a
living by the law; it was equally clear that I
<i>should</i> get one in the Church; and, therefore,
without a moment's hesitation, I jumped at the
Prelate's offer, and submitted myself to his directions 
for my future guidance.</p>

<p>"The difficulties in my way were few. I
had graduated at Cambridge&mdash;I was to be furnished 
with a title, my own good Bishop was
to ordain me, and that ceremony was very shortly
to be followed by another, which was to unite me
to the object of my affections, so soon as any
piece of preferment fell vacant, which might
give me a home to take her to; for up to the
moment of the relinquishment of my secular
pursuits, I occupied chambers, on the third

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

floor of Hare Court, in the Temple, 'a shady,
blest retreat,' not well calculated for the residence 
of one so good, so amiable, and tenderly-reared, 
as Sarah Grimsthorpe, who was then the
very picture of our dear Harriet!"</p>

<p>I wished, devoutly, that my excellent friend
had not given me the last piece of information.
Nothing is so terrible as to see a woman hideous
in face, unwieldy in person, and coarse in features, 
walking with a daughter, fair, slim, sylph-like 
and symmetrical, but who bears just sufficient 
resemblance to her Gorgon-like parent to
convince one, that when she comes to be as old
as her mother, she will be her very counterpart.
Mrs. Wells was, for her standing in life, a very
respectable-looking lady; but, to live for twenty,
or five-and-twenty years, watching the progress
of my pretty Harriet, till at last she should reach
the maternal standard of age and size, seemed
to me to be a dreadful anticipation. However,
I believe I was wrong,&mdash;constant, habitual association 
deprives these evils of their importance;&mdash;youth 
goes, and age comes so gradually and

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

imperceptibly, that the change, so visible to
other eyes, is not made evident to those who
suffer it; else why should Mr. Wells himself
have proposed, that very day, that his wife and
daughter should have two dresses made of the
same material, and in the same fashion?&mdash;However, 
I listened to his adventures with attention,
hoping to reap some instruction in the end.</p>

<p>"Well," continued he, "having completed
my metamorphosis, and become a deacon and a
curate, I commenced doing duty. I confess I
was a good deal alarmed at the sound of my own
voice in reading; but when I came to preach,
the recollection that there was no counsel on the
other side to reply, put me somewhat at my ease&mdash;my 
good patron had lent me a sermon for the
occasion, which turned out very effective, as I
was told, although the omission of several pages
in the middle of it, which I had unfortunately
left at home by accident, rendered it not quite
so connected as it might have been if I had had
it all: the mishap, however, had the effect of
shortening it, which, perhaps, contributed to

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

please the parishioners, some of whom, as it
were, "slept, or seemed to sleep," not much
admiring the practice of parsons who treat their
texts as Dido did the hide, and lengthen them
out until they encompass a very Byrsa of time.</p>

<p>"With all decent speed," continued Wells,
"my patron ordained me priest; and never shall
I forget the kind manner in which he addressed
me upon the evening after my admission to that
rank. 'Mr. Wells,' said he, 'you are now
placed&mdash;henceforth it becomes your own affair
to push yourself. I have given you my pledge
that the first piece of preferment which falls, in
<i>my</i> gift, shall be yours; but mark me&mdash;I have
observed in your character something like carelessness 
of your own interests,&mdash;a dilatoriness,&mdash;a 
procrastination; recollect, that much of your
success will depend upon your own activity.
Very often, vacancies occur in livings, of which
I do not hear for several days; other people are
on the alert; and even before I have been made
aware that I had the power to bestow the preferment, 
I have received applications from high

<!-- vol 3 page 215 -->

quarters, which must be attended to, unless I
have actually given away the benefice; therefore, 
be vigilant,&mdash;keep your eyes about you,
and the moment you hear of a living dropping,
start off directly to me; for I do assure you,
seeing how much attached you and my niece are
to each other, I am most anxious to put you in
a situation to marry, although I entirely agree
with her mother in the prudential postponement
of your union until you have a home of your
own, and are, in fact, established."</p>

<p>"I need not add," said Wells, "that I not only
promised punctual obedience to his Lordship's
instructions, but that I rigidly practised the
course he recommended. I made a constant
round of visits of inquiry after the health of all
the most ancient incumbents in the diocese, and
found, to my infinite dissatisfaction, that they
were all uncommonly well; and this salubrious
state of things continued for several months,
during which period I was placed in the extremely
unpleasant position of what is called 'waiting for
dead men's shoes.' At last, my suspense ended:

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

one day in January&mdash;sharp frost&mdash;'an eager and
a nipping air'&mdash;I was on horseback, crossing
Glanberry Hill&mdash;I heard the toll of a church
bell, when, casting my eye&mdash;as a fisherman
would his bait, without the hope of a bite&mdash;into
the valley below, there I saw&mdash;what&mdash;what do
you think?"</p>

<p>"I cannot guess," said I.</p>

<p>"A funeral, wending its way out of Glanberry
Parsonage towards the church door; the effect
of the black procession upon the white snow was
most remarkable. Glanberry was worth 800<i>l</i>.
a-year, and in the Bishop's gift. In an instant,
all his Lordship's allegations against my activity
and watchfulness flashed upon my mind&mdash;three
weeks had elapsed since I had visited that neighbourhood, 
and then, 'The rector was quite well.'
Still I did not know how to excuse myself to
my patron for my palpable remissness, nor calculate 
the mischief the delay might have occasioned.</p>

<p>"In order to ascertain the precise date of the
event upon which so much depended, I pulled

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

up at the corner of the deep-rutted lane which
leads down to Glanberry village, and which
looked, at the moment, like the top of a twelfth-cake, 
considerably mangled about the sugar, and
hailed one of the clods of the village.</p>

<p>" 'I say,' cried I, 'how long is it since Mr.
Simpkinson died?'</p>

<p>" 'Last Monday, Sir,' said the man.</p>

<p>" 'He wasn't ill long?' asked I.</p>

<p>" 'Only three days, Sir,' said the man.
'That's just it, Sir&mdash;we are here to-day, and
gone to-morrow.'</p>

<p>" 'Thank you, my friend,' said I, resolving,
at all events, for once, however much I admired
and admitted the pithiness of his remark upon
the uncertainty of life, to reverse the principle in
my own case. I muttered it to myself, 'I shall
be gone to-day, and <i>here</i> to-morrow,' and putting
spurs to my nag, hurried home to my intended
mother-in-law's; and, without further delay, took
a post-chaise to the first inn on the high road,
and thence, per Comet, transported myself to
London, where my Right Reverend Patron had

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

established himself, in order to attend his Parliamentary 
duties.</p>

<p>"I need not," said Wells, "detain you with
an account of the kind reception I met with.
The Bishop took me cordially by the hand,
expressed not only his great delight at the vacancy, 
and the opportunity it afforded him of
securing my happiness with Sarah&mdash;but his
approbation of my activity and vigilance in having 
got the start of any other applicant. He
pressed my hand again at parting, and wrote
an extremely warm note, of which I was the
bearer, to Mrs. Grimsthorpe, introducing me
formally as the rector of Glanberry.</p>

<p>"When I left his Lordship's house," continued 
my father-in-law elect, "I felt very differently 
from what I felt when I arrived. I was
conscious of a responsibility which had never
belonged to me before&mdash;I had the cure of souls&mdash;I 
felt the importance of my ministerial character, 
and resolved, now that I had really and
positively assumed it, to act up to the expectations 
which I fancied my patron had formed.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

<p>"I hastened to my mother-in-law's, and was
rewarded with a smile and a shake of the hand
by the old lady, and a squeeze of the hand, and
something more agreeable, by the young one.
The day of happiness had dawned, and the next
morning I was to proceed to Glanberry, to communicate 
with the respected Mrs. Simpkinson,
on the subject of taking possession, having previously 
bound Mrs. Grimsthorpe and Sarah to
the most inviolable secrecy, inasmuch as, after
what the Bishop had told me of occasional applications 
from ministers, I felt that the thing,
however near my lip the cup might be, was not
perfectly safe till I was actually inducted.</p>

<p>"To Sarah, the prospect of a residence in
that part of the country was very agreeable.
Glanberry parsonage was beautifully situated&mdash;in 
the valley, it is true, but sheltered by a tuft
of tall and noble trees&mdash;a clear trout-stream circumundulated 
the grounds, black as ink beneath
their shade, and bright as silver in the sunshine&mdash;the 
place, too, might be improved&mdash;and so on,&mdash;but 

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

it was all we wished for, all we wanted;
and however much my happiness was alloyed by
the reflection that a human being had died to
make way for me, I could not help remembering
that he had held the living five-and-twenty
years, and came into possession of it under a
similar contingency.</p>

<p>"No sooner had we breakfasted," continued
Wells, "for with such credentials as the Bishop's
presentation I was held presentable at the <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>
of the dowager, than I mounted my horse and
rode off to Glanberry, resolving to take no servant 
with me, nor give any indication of the
object of my visit. Instead of mounting the
hill, I kept along the lower left-hand road, and
when I approached the boundaries of <i>my</i> parish,
I pulled-up into a walk, fearful lest the 'very
stones should prate at my whereabout;' and,
having as quietly and unostentatiously as possible 
reached the second-rate inn, I delivered
my nag to the ostler, and, telling him I should
not be long gone, set forward upon what, however 

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

advantageous to me the results, I could not
but feel to be a delicate and disagreeable conversation 
with the late incumbent's family.</p>

<p>"I approached the rectory; but, I must confess, 
strong as I was in the zeal of my new calling, 
I saw in my way thither many moving
sights,&mdash;girls of tender years, evidently without
control, and boys, still yet their juniors, using
language, which, however venial I might have
thought it when I occupied other stations, convinced 
me, that the strictest attention had not
been paid to the morals of the population.
'This,' said I to myself, 'I will soon set to
rights; and Sarah is so good, and so devoted to
works of charity and beneficence, that she will
be a fitting helpmeet in my labours.' Many
other things I saw, scarce worth enumerating
now, which cried aloud for correction; and drawing 
good from evil, I felt rather gratified than
otherwise, that something was left for me to do,
in order to raise myself in the estimation of the
well-disposed portion of the inhabitants of Glanberry.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

<p>"When I reached the rectory, I rang the bell&mdash;it 
sounded mournfully. How often had the
late incumbent rang that bell, which, for nearly
a quarter of a century, had announced to his
watchful wife and affectionate children his return
to his peaceful fireside. 'How transient,' thought
I, 'is everything of this world&mdash;How justly
does Young say&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"The most attenuated thread
Is cord, is cable to man's, tended
Ill or earthly bliss&mdash;"</p>

</div>

<p>" 'Here is the house in which he delighted&mdash;here 
are the grounds which he improved&mdash;the
trees he planted&mdash;and these are now mine; and
that study, through the windows of which the
cheerful fire, beside which he sat, was wont to
gleam at this time of the year, and before which
his favourite spaniel lay and slumbered&mdash;that,
too, devolves on me&mdash;all his care&mdash;all his partiality 
were vain&mdash;and yet&mdash;so will it be with <i>me</i>,
who am now so anxiously about to take possession 
of it.'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

<p>"A servant, in the deepest mourning, opened
the gate. I asked, in a tone, and with an expression 
of countenance unassumed and natural
while such thoughts were in my mind, 'If his
mistress were at home?' The man answered,
'Yes;' and as I followed him round the gravel
sweep to the door of the house, I could scarcely
refrain from a tear, while thinking that the hour
was come when the quiet of an amiable family
must be disturbed, and they cast upon the world,
to seek another habitation and a home.</p>

<p>"The man ushered me into the drawing-room, 
where I found the amiable daughters of
the late incumbent&mdash;their mother was yet absent; 
this, somehow, I did not regret, and I
even felt a hope that she might not present
herself: inasmuch as what I had to communicate
might be told to the young ladies with less painful 
effect than it would be likely to produce
upon their surviving parent. Upon hearing my
name announced, the eldest of the group arose,
and motioned me to take a seat; I said that
the object of my visit was to say a few words to

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

Mrs. Simpkinson, whom I had understood to be
at home, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Mamma is at home,' said Miss Simpkinson, 
'and will be here in a few minutes&mdash;pray
be seated.'</p>

<p>"I sat down, and cast my eyes round the
drawing-room, which looked extremely comfortable, 
and commanded an exceedingly pretty
view of the grounds, which were very tastefully
disposed in the valley; while the side of the hill
whence I had viewed the funeral, well-studded
with tall firs, afforded an evergreen background 
to the clumps and clusters of laurels,
and other immutable plants which graced the
lawn.</p>

<p>" 'I assure you,' said I, 'that it is with no
small degree of pain I pay Glanberry this visit;
I am quite aware that, from long habit, it must
have become a favourite residence with you all,
and nothing is more disagreeable than displacing
a family, to whose taste a house is so much indebted 
for improvement and comfort.'</p>

<p>" 'It will, indeed,' said Miss Simpkinson,

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

'be a dreadful sacrifice when we are forced to
give it up; my two sisters were born here, and
I came hither when I was but two years old.'</p>

<p>" 'When,' said I, tenderly, 'when does your
amiable mother think of leaving this&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'We propose,' said the young lady, 'going
to London in about ten days.'</p>

<p>" 'I trust,' said I, 'that your mother will not
think of hurrying away on my account,&mdash;let her
suit her own convenience, and take her own time.
I need not explain further the nature of my
visit&mdash;the more lightly such details are touched
upon, the better for all our sakes; if I get in by
Lady-day I shall be quite satisfied, because I
see, by the state of this room, it must be new
papered.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Sir,' said Miss Simpkinson, 'it <i>is</i>
rather faded.'</p>

<p>" 'And I think,' said I, seeing how philosophically 
the orphans bore the subject, 'I shall
knock down this end of the room, and throw out
a bay-window where the recess is; by doing
which, and cutting through the wall, and making

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

a pair of double folding-doors into the dining-room, 
we shall get a vista from one end of the
house to the other.'</p>

<p>" 'Papa once thought of doing that,' said the
second daughter.</p>

<p>" 'Poor dear man,' said I, 'those reflections
are now of no use&mdash;I mean, besides these alterations, 
to add a conservatory to the suite, which I
think will have a good effect; will you allow
me just to measure a little?" Saying which,
I rose from my chair, and paced across the
room.</p>

<p>" 'Pray, Sir,' said Miss Simpkinson, after
whispering with her sister, 'might I ask, did
Papa ever communicate to you his intentions?'</p>

<p>" 'No,' said I, 'we never were personally
acquainted; but of course none of these alterations 
will be begun till you have finally quitted
the premises.'</p>

<p>" 'Finally!' said Miss Simpkinson, 'we are
only going to London for six weeks.'</p>

<p>" 'Why,' said I, blending a little of the
dictatorial with the pathetic and sympathetic,

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

'after you once leave the house, I think I must
be compelled to take possession; because it will
be a great object to me to be here early in the
spring.'</p>

<p>" 'Pray, Sir,' said the young lady, 'may I
inquire what you propose doing here?'</p>

<p>" 'Living here altogether,' said I, 'I shall
have no other house for the next year or two.'</p>

<p>" 'In what capacity?" said Miss Simpkinson.</p>

<p>" 'As rector of Glanberry,' said I. I feared
I had not made myself sufficiently understood:
but I was delicate in explaining. 'The bishop
has presented me to the living, and with all proper 
consideration for your feelings and convenience, 
as well as for those of your excellent
parent, I think the period I have fixed is as
distant as I can well name.'</p>

<p>" 'Dear me!' said Miss Simpkinson, 'how
very strange!&mdash;would not you like to see
Papa?'</p>

<p>" 'Oh dear no,' said I, 'not for the world.'</p>

<p>" 'Ah!' said the young lady, 'here he comes
to explain for himself.'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

<p>"I turned round, and beheld, to my infinite
amazement, a most respectable rubicund divine
and a lady, moving along a nice smooth gravel
walk, looking as plump as red-legged partridges,
as loving as doves, and much better than I
could possibly have expected.</p>

<p>"Our meeting was of a very curious nature;
I was considerably embarrassed; I did not personally 
know my fat friend, but his eldest
daughter, opening the glass-door which led to
the garden, admitted the happy couple, to whom
she presented me, as her Pa and Ma.</p>

<p>" 'Sir,' said my clerical friend, unshovelling
his head, 'I am extremely glad to see you.'</p>

<p>" 'You are very kind, Sir,' said I, 'I
have only just called to take a look over the
premises.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Papa,' said Miss Simpkinson, who
seemed rather angry, and sufficiently versed in
church matters to see that there must be some
mistake, 'this gentleman says the Bishop has
presented him to your living.'</p>

<p>" 'Indeed!' said Papa, 'as how, Sir, I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

<p>" 'Why, Sir, briefly thus,' said I; 'upon the
death of our lamented friend, the late incumbent, 
I applied for the preferment, and obtained 
it.'</p>

<p>" 'Upon the death of the late incumbent,
Sir!' said my friend, 'why you could scarcely
have been born when the late incumbent died&mdash;it 
is more than four-and-twenty years since.'</p>

<p>" 'Dear me, Sir,' said I, 'then I must be
either mad or dreaming; I made the application
to the Bishop only the day before yesterday, and
the day before <i>that</i>, I became acquainted with
the demise of the late rector.'</p>

<p>"At this announcement everybody stared,
and the lady of the house, with a prudence
worthy of the highest praise, stuck the poker
into the fire.</p>

<p>" 'Demise, Sir!' said Simpkinson, 'why!
do I look like a dead man? Here I am alive
and well&mdash;I cannot say merry&mdash;for the dress in
which you see my family will sufficiently
announce that we have experienced a sad and
heavy loss.'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

<p>" 'What, Sir!' exclaimed I, so completely
overcome as not to be able exactly to fashion
my words properly, 'wasn't you buried last
Tuesday?'</p>

<p>" 'Not I,' replied the incumbent, for such he
proved to be; 'my poor brother George, who
had been staying here for some time, died last
week, and was interred in our church on the
day you mention, but for <i>me</i>&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Well,' exclaimed Miss Simpkinson, who
seemed delighted with the result, 'I thought
there must be some mistake.'</p>

<p>" 'Upon my word,' said I, 'I can only throw
myself upon your kindness and indulgence to
forgive me; there certainly <i>is</i> a mistake, and the
mistake is certainly mine; the similarity of the
name, and the profession I believe'&mdash;here I received 
a nod of assent&mdash;'have caused this <i>contretemps</i>, 
and I have only to apologise for what must
appear a most impertinent intrusion upon you at
this moment. I hope, Sir,' continued I, proffering
my hand to the worthy rector, 'you will pardon
me, and that our very curious introduction to

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

each other may lead to a future acquaintance;
you may rest assured that I should be the last
man in the world to rejoice in your death.'</p>

<p>" 'Ha!' said the third daughter, who before
had said nothing, and seemed now determined
to fire off an old joke, 'it is not Pa's death you
would rejoice in, Sir, but his <i>living</i>.</p>

<p>"I affected not to understand this quibble of
the pert thing, who, I could see, was the pet
of the family, and fancied herself a beauty; and
having bowed to all the party, tripped over the
carpet, and stumbled down the steps, and left the
house in search of my horse, whose stall in
possession was worth infinitely more than <i>my</i>
rectory <i>in prospectu</i>.</p>

<p>"That," said Wells, "was my first great
failure; however, time and patience conquered
all obstacles, and I married Sarah upon an income 
not much exceeding what you state yours to
be now&mdash;and as for <i>her</i> fortune, she did not come
to it till the death of her excellent mother; but
we contrived to get on, and although we had

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

nothing superfluous, yet we lived as people in
our state of life should."</p>

<p>I was very well pleased to hear this adventure
of my respectable father-in-law, and it was told
with all the advantages of point and manner,
which very much reminded me of my friend
Daly; but I did not quite relish the climax.
By way of inference from the story, he told me
of his skill in making the most of a little, and
in the art of doing as well upon a small income,
as another man could upon a large one; but
these were not agreeable indications to a lover
who had less than four hundred a-year, who
stood pledged to marry a charming young lady
with nothing at all, which seemed, from all I
could collect, to be the real state of the case.</p>

<p>Wells, however, whose volubility when once
"off" was uncheckable, and who appeared to
me, upon this particular morning, resolved to
talk me out of the main object of my interview,
which was really to ascertain how I was safely
and consistently to fulfil my engagement with

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

him and his daughter, would not let me pause
here; nor could I get quit of him till he had
explained to me how the Bishop rallied him
upon his blunder, and how he got a living in
Norfolk, where his sporting propensities were
fully gratified, and whence his excursions to
Newmarket produced that gentle remonstrance
from another Prelate, of which he had just
given me the description. "The acquisition of
this preferment," said he, "accelerated my happiness. 
Never shall I forget the strange embarrassments 
of our wedding-day, or rather
evening! Sarah, as she still has, had then a
great dislike to show or affectation, and we
determined when the happy hour was fixed, to
take it quietly, and resolved, as we were to start
for Norfolk, to have no favours, no ringings, no
noises, no <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ners</i>, nor anything of the kind;
but to take our dinner domestically with my
mother-in-law, and start in the evening with
no servant but Sarah's maid, and so sleep at
Chelmsford&mdash;at the Black Boy, a remarkably
good inn in those days&mdash;we did not send down

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

for rooms&mdash;afraid of being found out, and didn't
like being laughed at.&mdash;Wedding over&mdash;Sarah
and I, one&mdash;we fulfilled all our intentions, were
kissed and blessed by the amiable Mrs. Grimsthorpe, 
and by seven o'clock packed in our
postchaise&mdash;away we went&mdash;post-boy in the
dark, both as to the night, and as to the
matrimonial part of our expedition&mdash;changed at
Romford, and reached the wished-for inn at a
quarter after ten. Waiters,&mdash;chambermaids,&mdash;ostlers, 
and landlord in a moment were at the
carriage-door. Down went the steps&mdash;up came
mine host.</p>

<p>" 'Very sorry, Sir,' said he, 'we have no
accommodation to-night; not a room disengaged, 
Sir. The third division of the 75th
regiment of foot marched in this afternoon;
and neither here nor at the Head (Saracen's)
is there a bed unoccupied. Great regret, Sir&mdash;wish 
you had written, Sir, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Poor Sarah was a good deal tired&mdash;what
with the journey, and the excitement, and one
thing and another. However, what could be

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

done? Nothing remained but going on to
Witham. Blue Posts&mdash;capital house&mdash;decided
in a moment&mdash;ordered horses&mdash;took four to accelerate 
our movements. First and second turn
out, down the yard&mdash;up they come&mdash;poke them
in&mdash;boys mount&mdash;crack go the whips, and away
go we. I confess it <i>was</i> very provoking; but
there was no help for it."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "you reached Witham?"</p>

<p>"Just at midnight," said Wells. "Lights in
the windows, and groups at the door;&mdash;all up.
There things looked better, and Sally was preparing 
for a spring from the carriage, when the
waiter, with extended arms, meant rather to
repel than welcome us, sang the second part of
the Chelmsford tune, by informing us that we
couldn't have a bed in Witham, as the <i>second</i>
division of the 75th regiment of foot had
marched in that afternoon, and occupied every
available apartment.</p>

<p>"This was enough to try the patience of Job.
I swore, and Sarah cried; but all in vain. We
had, as in the former case, no resource but proceeding 

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

to Colchester, where the more extensive
means of accommodation gave us hopes that,
even at the late hour at which we should reach
it, we might find shelter; and, accordingly, two
elderly post-boys were aroused from their slumbers, 
and mounted upon jaded horses, which,
however, by dint of flogging, arrived in front
of the Cups, at Colchester, at about half-past
one, where, to our great delight, we found
every thing remarkably lively and gay.</p>

<p>" 'Can we have rooms?' said I, in a tone of
anxiety not to be described.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, Sir; sitting-room and bed-room directly,' 
said the waiter. 'Beg to apologise,
Sir, for the sitting-room&mdash;down stairs; but the
<i>first</i> division of the 75th regiment of foot
marched in here this afternoon, and the officers
are giving a dinner to the Mayor and several
members of the Corporation, Sir.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh,' said I, 'never mind the Mayor and
Corporation: show us to our rooms; for we are
tired to death.'</p>

<p>" 'This way, Sir,' said the man, who was

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

speedily joined by a chambermaid; and together 
they ushered us into a parlour on the
left-hand of the gateway, in which parlour
stage-coach passengers were generally fed in
the daytime.</p>

<p>" 'Which do you like, Ma'am,' said the maid
to Sarah, 'the feather-bed a-top or the mattress?'</p>

<p>"The question, under the circumstances, excited 
a considerable degree of confusion on the
part of my dear bride, who evaded a direct
answer, by desiring to be shown to her apartment; 
while her maid, who had rushed incontinently 
to the kitchen fire to warm her feet,
was summoned to attend her mistress.</p>

<p>"I took advantage of their temporary absence
to fortify nature with a glass of egged-wine, which
I found agree so well with my constitution, that
I ordered a second, at the same time telling the
waiter to desire the chambermaid to send my
wife's maid down to me. This instruction was
obeyed; and I desired Mrs. Harvey to ask her
mistress whether she would allow me to send

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

her anything to cheer her up after her worrying 
journey, or whether she was coming down
again. But I got very little consolation from
the maid, who gave me to understand that her
lady was in the greatest agitation, and that she
really did not know what to do.</p>

<p>" 'What is the matter?' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Matter, Sir!' replied the maid; 'matter
enough, I think! Where do you think your
sleeping-room is?'</p>

<p>" 'How should I know?' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Why, Sir, if you'll believe me,' said the
maid, 'you have to go into the mess-room, as
they call it&mdash;and a nice mess it is in&mdash;among
all the soldier-officers, and mayors and corporationers, 
and turn to your right-hand, right afore
'em all. It's the only room unoccupied&mdash;or, at
least, as was unoccupied; and there's my poor
mistress, tucked up, and trembling like a haspen 
leaf, with nothing but a half-inch plank between 
her and the first division of his Majesty's
75th regiment of foot!'</p>

<p>" 'The deuce she is!' said I. 'What a state

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

for a bride! There's not a moment to be lost;&mdash;I'm 
off. Poor Sarah exposed to the conversation, 
at least, of those oysterous, boisterous
convivialists!'</p>

<p>" 'When <i>I</i> come down,' said the maid, 'one
of 'em was dancing on the table, and twelve or
thirteen singing something to the tune of the
"Sprig of Shillelagh and Shamrock so Green;"
and I'm sure it's near three o'clock in the morning.'</p>

<p>" 'Broiled bones for thirteen, and two more
pecks of oysters,' cried a waiter in the passage.
'Three bowls of punch, and eight brandy-grogs, 
cold without.'</p>

<p>"In a frenzy I seized the candlestick, and,
marshalled by my Thais, ascended the staircase,
and having, under her direction, pushed open a
door, found myself, sure enough, in the midst
of a galaxy of heroes, military and civil, who
were good enough to receive me 'with all the
honours,' and a shout which continued till I had
made good my landing in our apartment, the
door of which I locked and bolted; and having
then, with great labour, dragged a chest of

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

drawers, which happened to be in the room,
against the portal, fell to soothing my poor
Sarah, who lay shivering and shaking at the
stormy hilarity of our gallant neighbours.</p>

<p>"It may be easily imagined that we did not
sleep much. More than once, before they retreated, 
attempts were made to force an entrance
to our room. At some periods we were treated
with shouts of laughter, following loud toasts
and louder songs; nor was it until near five
o'clock that the corps dispersed, the whole party
singing 'God save the King,' <i>fortissimo</i>. To
these succeeded people putting out the lights
and clearing the things away, who continued
their avocation for another hour at least, so that
our start in matrimonial life was anything but
propitious; however, I tell you this as a warning; 
and when you carry off Harriet, take special 
care to inquire whether any of His Majesty's 
troops are moving on the same line of
march."</p>

<p>It was impossible not to be amused by the
manner in which the reverend gentleman related 

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

the story, which was infinitely more
<i>piquante</i> in his version of it, than in my transcript; 
but still it ended with an allusion to a
subject of which, as it appeared to me, he now
never lost sight&mdash;I mean my marriage with his
daughter, to which he incessantly referred, as I
thought, in order to stamp indelibly upon my
mind the absolute certainty of its occurrence,
taking <i>my</i> silence as an admission and acquiescence, 
before he came to that particular discussion, 
the issue of which appeared to me
likely to influence the result very seriously.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished this tale of misadventures, 
before the ladies made their re-appearance, 
accompanied by my friends the Nubleys.
This was a new embarrassment, and a fresh
entanglement; I should no doubt be presented
to my old acquaintances in my new character,
and thus more witnesses to the earnestness of
my proposal and the seriousness of its acceptance 
would be procured. However, the conversation 
which I so much desired, could not be
very long delayed, and as I thought it was best

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

to put a good face upon the matter, I joined
the new arrivals with an air of gaiety, which I
must say Mrs. Nubley seemed fully to appreciate 
and duly to sympathize with. I admit,
however, that I felt extremely awkward when I
offered my arm to Harriet, and rather more so
when she accepted it; but I was quite overcome
when, with what appeared to me a malicious
activity, the rest of the party contrived to separate, 
and leave us together, and alone, at the
identical turn in the walk where, the night
before, we had stopped to look at the moon!</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening, and supper which succeeded to
this "observation," varied very considerably
from any of which I had previously partaken
at Wells's. Instead of catching a look of Harriet's 
soft eyes stealthily, or wishing to cajole
myself and others into a belief of my perfect
carelessness about her, we were what might be
called fixed&mdash;settled: everybody got out of our
way; nobody interfered with us; and when the
dear young pinafore, who had always been hopping 
and jumping about us, came evidently prepared 
to ask Harriet some <i>na&iuml;ve</i> question, her
mother called her away with a sort of snub,
just as she would have interdicted her peeping 
at a brace of birds in a cage,&mdash;dear creatures, 
who never breed if they are looked at.
The thought struck me at the moment, and I

<!-- vol 3 page 244 -->

could hardly help fancying my dear fair-haired
Harriet and myself a pair of canaries, in order
to encourage whom in their matrimonial propensities, 
the careful fancier hangs up a ready-made 
bag of hair, and moss, and other materials, 
essential to the progress of nidification.</p>

<p>The only thing which enlivened me in the
midst of my happiness was a particularly favourable 
display of my dear friend Nubley's extraordinary 
faculty of thinking aloud, which he made
infinitely to <i>my</i> delight, and to the superlative
horror of Mrs. Empson, his partner at whist,
during one of the interesting periods of that
sublime game.</p>

<p>"Play, Ma'am," <i>said</i> he to his partner,&mdash;and
then he <i>thought</i>, "Umph, I suppose she'll play
her king&mdash;she <i>must</i> have the king. I can see
into Sims's hand&mdash;<i>he</i> hasn't got it. Mrs. Illingworth 
can't have it, she refused before&mdash;umph!"</p>

<p>The poor lady was confused in the highest
degree. Of all that her partner had thought, and
which of course their opponents heard, she did
not feel it right to take advantage, being certain, 

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

at the same time, that if she did not, she
should be overwhelmed by a broadside of censure 
for her blundering; for Nubley was a strict
player, and never meant to express one of his
thoughts or surmises. She chose for herself,
and played the king&mdash;a proceeding which immediately 
produced a telegraphic signal between 
Mr. Sims and Mrs. Illingworth, which
as the <i>coup</i> made them game and game, in the
rubber made no great difference.</p>

<p>Wells was more than usually agreeable, and
when that most sociable of meals&mdash;supper&mdash;came,
we sat down snug and cosy, and it was all
very enjoyable. But Harriet!&mdash;what could I
do?&mdash;she was mine. I could not maintain an
establishment without means, and yet I possessed 
her; and in the middle of the gaiety I
thought&mdash;and every body knows how rapidly the
chain of thought rattles through the brain&mdash;that,
if my brother Cuthbert were really so rich, and
so much attached to me, I need not go to plod
and follow in his steps, and come home, perhaps
worn out and broken down, like Nubley, in

<!-- vol 3 page 246 -->

order to secure a competency. He himself had
achieved that great object; he had sacrificed,
as I considered, his time, and certainly, by his
own account, injured his health, in money-hunting, 
and having accumulated a fine fortune,
of course he would leave it to me at his death&mdash;a 
conclusion to which I was naturally drawn
by his having most liberally proposed to augment 
my income during his life-time. This, as
I warmed with some of my excellent and reverend 
father-in-law's mixture, rather raised my
spirits, and Harriet brightened up too, perhaps
because she saw my cheerfulness increase; and
so when the party dispersed, and I walked home
with the Nubleys, I felt that I had not done
so foolish a thing&mdash;or perhaps I might say, had
not been led into so foolish a thing&mdash;as I at
first fancied my proposed alliance with the
Wellses to be.</p>

<p>The manner in which Nubley had wrapped
himself up for his summer evening's walk,
totally precluded the possibility of any lengthened 
conversation. I took charge of Mrs.

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

Nubley, whose long residence in hotter climates,
I suppose, had rendered a small exhibition of a
little warm negus, or something of the sort, congenial, 
for she&mdash;who held my arm&mdash;never ceased
talking till we arrived at the gates of Chittagong
Lodge, and when we had achieved this, Nubley
put his frog-like mouth out of his steaming
worsted net comforter, in which his chin and
even nose were enveloped, and said, "That
Sims is a beast&mdash;five rubbers we played together,&mdash;he 
revoked twice, told of it once, and trumped
a thirteenth."</p>

<p>Nothing more passed that evening as to my
prospects, except a few cheering laughs from
Mrs. Nubley, at the recollection of Harriet's
tender looks cast towards me during the evening. 
"Lauk, Gilbert, you are such a man&mdash;oh 
dear! he, he, he!" all of which sounded most
discordant to my ears, because, with all good
intentions, it proved to me that I had not so
abstractedly fixed my devoted glances upon the
tender young creature as I ought to have done.
The morning, however, brought with it scenes

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

and events, for which, although I might naturally 
have been prepared, I scarcely expected so
soon&mdash;scenes which I am able now but imperfectly 
to describe, and events which at one blow
tottered my air-built castles to their foundations,
and darkened the prospects which hope had
rendered brilliant.</p>

<p>When once an idea gets possession of the
mind, sown there like an acorn, how rapidly it
begins to germinate&mdash;how it grows up, and
spreads its branches, until it affords a refreshing
shade under which to repose! The new view I
had recently taken of my brother's position in
the world, with the consciousness, and indeed
his own declaration to the effect that he would
at all events take care of me, had so turned the
current of my thoughts and anticipations, that
I fell asleep from mere weariness of calculating
the results of the declaration I resolved to make
to him of my preference for England, and the
tranquil pleasures of domestic life, upon a small
scale, to the more magnificent allurements of
an Eastern residence, where, after all, the luxuries 

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

by which a man is surrounded, are only so
many attempts at counteracting evils which
here, where we have not the luxuries, do not
exist. Thus, making a sort of debtor and creditor 
account of the ills and advantages of a
Calcutta life, it appeared to me that I should
find true happiness no where but at home.
This feeling even pervaded my dreams, and I
went down to breakfast resolved to remain where
I was, and trust to Cuthbert's fraternal affection
and generosity for the rest.</p>

<p>When I entered the breakfast parlour, I
found Nubley moaning and murmuring, with
a letter in his hand, which he had just been
reading. He looked at me with one of his
contemplative stares, and even before the usual
matutinal salutation, muttered out, "Poor devil&mdash;bad 
business&mdash;umph!&mdash;not my fault that he
stopped so long&mdash;going to be married too!"&mdash;and
then recovering from his eloquent trance, he held
out his hand, and said, "Good morning, Gilbert."
I echoed the words&mdash;somewhat excited by the
oracular exclamations of my unconscious host.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

<p>"Letters from Calcutta," said Nubley.</p>

<p>"Any news from Cuthbert?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Nubley&mdash;"bad indigo-crop&mdash;eh!&mdash;good 
for holders&mdash;market overstocked with
English goods&mdash;glass and tin in demand."</p>

<p>"But Cuthbert is well?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Government paper high"&mdash;continued he&mdash;"your 
brother&mdash;yes&mdash;not well by any means:
he is married&mdash;at least so he writes word, I
think."</p>

<p>"Married!" exclaimed I&mdash;"Cuthbert married!" 
and the words, as I repeated them, seemed
to wither all my hopes: in an instant all the
expectations I had formed of my brother's protection 
and assistance, even if I remained in
England, were overthrown: he had formed a
new connexion&mdash;new ties would bind him, new
interests affect him: he would become the
father of new Gurneys, who would of course
supersede in his cares and affections the collateral 
branch.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nubley, "married a widow&mdash;a
very nice woman&mdash;was a barrister at Calcutta,

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

and died about ten years ago&mdash;that is, I mean,
her husband&mdash;poor fellow! He was a great
smoker&mdash;chilum after chilum&mdash;a very great
smoker!"&mdash;and then, relapsing, he continued&mdash;"Yes,&mdash;cuts 
him out to be sure&mdash;must go&mdash;hates 
it I know&mdash;what an ass he must have been,
to be sure, to go and fall in love with that girl.
Umph! Well, Mr. Gilbert," added he, speakingly, 
"I suppose now you will make up your
mind to take your departure forthwith&mdash;your
only chance&mdash;nothing to be done here&mdash;can't
keep a wife upon four hundred a year&mdash;bonnets,
shawls, trinkets, gewgaws."</p>

<p>"I want none of them," said I.</p>

<p>"No," said Nubley; "but Mrs. Gilbert Gurney 
will: look at <i>my</i> wife&mdash;never easy but when
she is buying something she does not want."</p>

<p>"Lauk, Mr. N.!" screamed the lady, who
most provokingly entered the room in time to
hear her husband's observations, "you are such
a man&mdash;he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Nubley, as soon as he heard
her voice, "you are there to speak for yourself&mdash;pretty 

<!-- vol 3 page 252 -->

business&mdash;no matter&mdash;nothing to us,
to be sure&mdash;<i>we</i> cannot help it&mdash;here, Gilbert,
read that side of Cuthbert's letter."</p>

<p>Saying which, he handed me that which, if
not my death-warrant, at least contained my
sentence of transportation, and doubling down
one side of the letter, which contained some
private remarks upon the relative qualities of the
different articles in which I was destined hereafter 
to deal, pointed to the passage which was
appointed for my perusal. I accordingly read
as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"In marrying I have sought to obtain an
amiable and rational companion&mdash;of the merits
of Mrs. Falwasser you are competent to judge.
Increasing in years, as I now am, I felt a want
of some being near me and about me who would
take and express an interest in my proceedings,
and to whom I might confide the thoughts and
feelings which, constituted as we are, become a
painful burden when confined to our own
hearts and minds. I had hoped that Gilbert
would long before this have accepted my often

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

repeated invitations to my home and my affections; 
but I fear my applications continue disregarded; 
and I have nothing to reproach myself 
with upon his account in forming this alliance. 
Mrs. Falwasser's three children are, as
you know, in England for their education; and
if you have an opportunity of communicating
with them through the lady under whose charge
the two eldest (girls) are placed, and to whom
Mrs. Gurney troubles you with a letter, I
should feel obliged by your making her acquainted, 
for their sakes, with the character of
their father-in-law, and in assuring them, as well
as their brother George, that in me they will
find a second parent, anxious, for their mother's
sake, to do every thing in my power to render
them happy, respectable, and comfortable."</p>

<p>I could at the moment read no further. Here
was the strongest evidence of the kindly generous 
feelings of my neglected brother diverted
by my carelessness of his exhortations and suggestions 
into other channels, even in a more decided 
manner than I had anticipated.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

<p>"Umph!" said Nubley, "you find out now
what you have lost&mdash;that's the way of young
people&mdash;commit follies&mdash;get sorry&mdash;get better&mdash;commit 
more&mdash;like what the proverb says,
'Marry in haste, repent at leisure.' "</p>

<p>"Lauk! Mr. N.," exclaimed the tea-making
lady, who saw that I was seriously affected by the
<i>bouleversement</i> of my fortunes, and the reproachful 
observations of my brother, "how you do
talk&mdash;why Mr. Cuthbert seems to have married
in haste&mdash;perhaps he may repent at leisure&mdash;he,
he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"Stuff," said Nubley, "why should he repent? 
Mrs. Falwasser is a clever, steady, respectable 
woman."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Mrs. Nubley, "I have
nothing to say against her respectability or her
cleverness; but she used to dress like a girl of
fifteen, and talk the greatest nonsense I ever
heard in my life; they say she talked Mr.
Falwasser to death&mdash;and as to vanity! lauk,
there never was such a woman&mdash;he, he, he,
he!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

<p>"Falwasser was a brute!" said Nubley&mdash;"a
queer, odd little man&mdash;coarse in manner&mdash;abrupt 
in conversation, and so absent that you
could not keep him to one point five minutes&mdash;besides, 
he was such a dirty-looking dog."</p>

<p>Overcome as I was by my feelings of disappointment 
and sorrow, I could not but open my
eyes and ears to these two speeches, which as
specimens of self-ignorance, if such a word may
be coined, seemed to me by far to exceed any
thing I had ever previously heard; each of
these people drew the other's portrait, while
caricaturing the imperfections of their absent
friends&mdash;and this they did with the most perfect
<i>sang froid</i>, and an utter unconsciousness of their
own faults and foibles.</p>

<p>"Don't read any more, Gilbert," said Mrs.
Nubley, "till after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Let him alone, Caroline," said Nubley;
"let him get it over: he will be better able to
decide what's to be done."</p>

<p>"Lauk, Mr. N., you are such a man!" replied 
the lady. "He, he, he!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

<p>I resumed my reading.</p>

<p>"You must not let Gilbert suppose, nor suppose 
yourself, that this alteration in my state has
made, or will make, any difference in my feelings 
towards him. That it will necessarily
make an alteration in my power of serving him
is true. I must not only consider the claims of
those with whom I have linked my fortunes;
but I must look forward to the claims of others
who may yet be born; but although I apprehend
any farther solicitation will be vain as regards
my brother's voyage hither, I beg you to assure
him that nothing would more add to my happiness 
than availing himself of the still open
opportunity of reaping an honourable and respectable 
competency for his after-life. I admit
I have been prejudiced against him by the
letters of our late mother's friend; but those
prejudices are formed neither against his heart
nor his principles&mdash;they point rather at his pursuits, 
his companions, and a flighty unsteadiness,
which I know are all operating against his embarkation 
in a lucrative and highly respectable

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

concern, which, with you before his eyes, cannot
fail to hold out a prospect even brighter than
that which greeted me on my arrival in this
country. I give him up, I confess. I have
written to him by this opportunity, once more
urging him to action, and assuring him of the
kindest reception and welcome from myself and
from his affectionate sister-in-law, who has from
herself added a postscript to my letter."</p>

<p>"There," said Nubley, "that's all there is
about you."</p>

<p>"There is enough," said I, almost sobbing
with grief, to find how deeply the calumnies and
misrepresentations of Miss Crab had sunk into
my brother's mind; and to think how childishly
I had conducted myself, so as to justify them in
a very eminent degree.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nubley, "what d'ye say? will
you go? you have nothing to look for from
him here&mdash;you have engaged yourself to be
married to a girl without a pice: what's your
determination?" And then added the worthy
gentleman, in one of his "mental ejaculations,"
"the fool won't go even now."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

<p>"I <i>will</i> go," said I, striking my hand upon
the table&mdash;"I will disprove the calumnies of my
bitterest enemy; I will reinstate myself in
Cuthbert's good opinion; and I would rather go
to him now than before, because he has less left
in his power to tempt me with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's right," said mine host; "what will
you do about Miss? will she wait for you till
you come home with your fortune?"</p>

<p>I cast my eyes over Mr. Nubley's person, and
thought&mdash;but not aloud.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said I; "why should we not be
married before I go?"</p>

<p>"What!" said Nubley, "and leave her behind&mdash;a 
sort of widow bewitched?"</p>

<p>"Behind!" exclaimed I, "no: make her the
partner of my voyage."</p>

<p>"Umph!" thought Nubley, "sleeping partner, 
eh?"</p>

<p>"Lauk, Mr. Nubley," screamed the lady,
"what a man you are&mdash;he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"Will she go?" said Nubley.</p>

<p>"I should think, undoubtedly, yes," said I:
and then there flitted across my mind the possibility 

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

of her refusing to make the sacrifice;
and then came a resolution to try her affection
by that test; and then a notion that perhaps she
would hesitate; and then a determination how I
should act. To go I had positively decided.
Acted upon by a combination of feelings, I saw
but one course to pursue; the conviction of what
I had already lost, increased my anxiety to save
what yet remained. I too had added, by my matrimonial 
engagement, to the obligations which
pointed to the undertaking; and I looked with
anxiety, like my brother, not only to the immediate 
claimant upon my care and protection who
really lived, and seemed to live for me, but to
those of others yet unborn. I felt, too, that I
had no other mode of redeeming my character for
steadiness and sobriety; and as, I believe, above
all other ties or inducements upon earth, to put
the scheme into execution, was a desire of vindicating 
myself from the attacks and insinuations
of Miss Crab. I should triumph over <i>her;</i> I
should trample down the obstacles she had maliciously 
thrown in my way, and prove myself

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

worthy of the affection and countenance of a
brother, of whom every body who knew him
spoke with esteem and respect, and whose letters
breathed the spirit of kindness and benevolence,
which his actions so beautifully embodied.</p>

<p>While this discussion was going on, Nubley
seemed a good deal agitated&mdash;he fidgetted&mdash;and
by the expression of his most inexpressive countenance, 
I anticipated some most generous proceeding 
on his part. I was sitting at the end of
the breakfast table, buried in thought; he stood
before me in the same state of mind. As usual,
he looked me full in the face; and, as usual,
began stubbling his chin. "Umph&mdash;partly my
fault&mdash;should have stopped his going to Wells's&mdash;wish 
I could do something for him myself&mdash;can't 
with nine nephews and nieces, besides the
whole tribe of Caddles&mdash;he ought to go."</p>

<p>"I repeat, Sir," said I, forgetting my usual
caution with regard to his cogitations, "I will
go; and I will not lose a moment in proceeding
to the rectory, and stating my determination to
the family."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

<p>"Lauk!" cried Mrs. Nubley, "you'll
frighten them to death; the very mention of a
sea-voyage will put the whole family into fits,&mdash;he, 
he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the family or their fits," said
Nubley; "you are in the right humour, Gilbert,
go while it lasts, and&mdash;don't be bamboozled&mdash;go."</p>

<p>I was in such a state of agitation during the
walk to the parsonage, that everybody passing
me must have thought me mad. I foresaw the
sensation my announcement would create&mdash;I
scarcely anticipated the actual consequences.
But delay was worse than useless: if I lingered
on a few more hours, or a few more days, it
would only be protracting the state of security in
which we appeared to fancy ourselves the night
before, in order to render its overthrow the more
painful; besides, with Mr. Nubley for a confidant,
it would be vain to attempt any concealment of
the eventual termination of the business. It
should be done directly; and the first paroxysm

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

of my feelings had not abated when I found
myself in Mr. Wells's library.</p>

<p>"Why, Gilbert," said the divine, "you are
earlier than usual to-day; eh! what's the matter? 
you are flurried&mdash;hurried&mdash;not worried,
I hope?"</p>

<p>" Never so much in my life, Sir," said I;
"my brother Cuthbert is married&mdash;married to a
widow with a family of children; and my only
chance for an existence, is in an immediate
voyage to Calcutta."</p>

<p>"What, now?" said Mr. Wells&mdash;"to India
now? surely the intelligence of your brother's
marriage cannot have obliterated from your
memory your own engagement of a similar
nature, with my daughter?"</p>

<p>"Obliterate, my dear Sir," said I; "no: on
the contrary, the imperious necessity for my
immediate departure, more deeply than anything
that could have occurred, impresses that engagement 
on my mind. Harriet will, I am sure,
not hesitate for a moment to accompany me to

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

a home of love and happiness, where, in addition
to my brother's welcome, she will now receive
one from my new sister-in-law. My brother's
letters, although they express a doubt, which I
must remove, of my perseverance in my projected 
voyage, breathe nothing but kindness,
and anxiety to see and greet me."</p>

<p>"That I have no doubt is the case, Gilbert,"
said Mr. Wells; "but recollect, this greeting
and welcome are offered by your brother to you,
individually and personally; he is as little aware
of the change which will probably take place in
your condition, as you were yesterday of that
which has occurred in his; and I think it will
require great consideration&mdash;I am sure my
wife will think so&mdash;before we consent to the
transportation of our darling child to a distant
country, and new connexions, without, as our
prejudices would tell us, the slightest chance of
ever seeing her again."</p>

<p>"There is no such chance, my dear Sir,"
said I; "we shall not remain long there; a few
years will be sufficient, I trust, to fulfil our most

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

anxious desires; and we shall return to you,
happy, and I trust wealthy."</p>

<p>"Wealth, Gilbert," said Mr. Wells, "does
not constitute happiness&mdash;I admit it forms a
principal ingredient; but you know my maxim&mdash;that 
which I have so often expressed&mdash;that
which I acted upon, when you honestly and
honourably confessed your attachment to my
daughter; and, as far as I am concerned, I
would rather see you and her snugly settled in
this neighbourhood, upon your own small income,
than lose the pleasure and charm of her society&mdash;and, 
I may say, yours&mdash;for the sake of reaping 
a harvest which, like that of our friend
Nubley, is housed too late in the season to be
enjoyed by the farmer&mdash;Besides, the voyage!"</p>

<p>"A mere pleasant excursion," said I; "a sail
in a wherry from Westminster to Wandsworth, is
infinitely more dangerous."</p>

<p>"For its duration, I grant you," said Wells;
"but you will, I am sure, forgive me for recalling 
to your recollection the many descriptions 
you have given us of your own horror of

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

the undertaking, the bare apprehension of which,
has kept you hitherto from performing what you
all along felt to be an act of duty and affection to
your brother, but which, now that you all at
once have discovered the absolute necessity of
performing it, are 'trifles, light as air;' and that
the perils and dangers, and inconveniences and
miseries, which you, as a single man, could not
venture to encounter, will prove to be nothing
more than a pleasurable excursion to a girl who
has never left her paternal roof, and who is as
inexperienced in the world, and as ill able to
endure its asperities as an infant."</p>

<p>"I see, Sir," said I, "that you are opposed
to my proposition: what can I do? how am
I to act?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand, Gilbert," said Mr.
Wells, "why you are so suddenly and violently
affected upon this point; your brother has repeatedly 
written in a similar strain, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "but his last letter shows me,
that I have already lost some part of his affection
and regard; and that I shall eventually be shut

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

out from his heart, if I remain apparently inattentive 
to his wishes, and regardless of his advice.
Besides, the new tie, the new anxiety which I
have incurred, forces me to rally, in order to render 
myself worthy of the love of her to whom my
faith is plighted. Will you permit me to speak
to Harriet upon the subject, plead my cause with
her, and hear her decree."</p>

<p>"Most certainly," said Wells; "reserving
always for myself and her mother, the right of
controlling her decision according to circumstances: 
what her decision may be, I do not
pretend to say, although I might probably
guess; but this I know, that her dread of the
treacherous element, to which you require her
to confide herself for weeks and months, is such,
that although it is said, 'Love's power is invincible 
and irresistible,' I apprehend even she will
falter, before she agrees to be the partner of
your expedition."</p>

<p>"I am content to rest my fate upon that,"
said I; "let me, therefore, speak to her, while
you consult Mrs. Wells: rely upon it, a life of

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

happiness opens to us. All the objections I
had to quitting England, will be overcome by
having Harriet the companion of my voyage;
and the study of my life will be to make her
happy."</p>

<p>"All this, as you say, Gilbert," replied my
Harriet's father, "looks bright and cheering;
but you forget what we shall feel who lose our
child. I am certain her mother will not hear of
it; however, I promise you, if not your advocate 
with her, not to plead against you: she
shall give her judgment fairly upon the merits of
the case, in her own mind,"</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," said I.</p>

<p>"You will find Harriet in the breakfast-room," 
said Wells; "but, before you see
her, let me hope that you will not exert a
greater degree of influence over her than you
consider actually necessary to put her fairly in
possession of your proposition; do not blind her
to the concomitant ills by which the expected
advantages will be surrounded; and, above all,

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

recollect, that as yet her filial duty is paramount
to any other."</p>

<p>"I will recollect all this," said I; "you may
trust me."</p>

<p>"I am sure I may, Gilbert," said Mr. Wells,
taking my hand. "This affair has come upon
me suddenly, and has unsettled me, and worries
me. If I had fancied the voyage to be a <i>sine
qua non</i>, I never certainly would have consented
to the match; that is now too late to be revoked,
and, therefore, as an optimist, I trust we shall
make the best of it."</p>

<p>Saying which, Wells proceeded to find his
wife, and I walked to the breakfast parlour,
where he had told me I should find Harriet.</p>

<p>What course the reverend gentleman really
intended to take with his better half, touching
the subject-matter under consideration, I did
not exactly comprehend. I had seen enough of
Mr. Wells, to be quite aware that he was a
perfect man of the world; and the consenting
scene to which he had referred during our

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

conversation, was never absent from my mind.
Nor could I fail of remarking, that, even upon
the present occasion, in spite of all opposing
difficulties, he pronounced his opinion, that
whatever might occur, or however the discussion
might end, the engagement was too far gone to
be revoked; so that I judged their verdict
would be, either that I should fulfil the contract,
and marry Harriet before my departure, leaving
her, as Nubley described it, a sort of "widow
bewitched;" or, that we were to plight our
faith and troth, and so wait for the marriage
until my return. Both these courses appeared
to me full of difficulty and annoyance. If I
were merely going on a voyage, with the engagement 
on my hands, to return again in one,
two, or even three years, the case would be
different; but I was going for an indefinite
period, and in a pursuit which, to be profitable,
must be lasting. To be sure, I had heard
Daly talk of "shamming sick," and had the
precedent of my friend the army surgeon, in the
stage coach, for getting a certificate for the liver

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

complaint, or rheumatism, which, as nobody
can <i>see</i> a pain in the side or back, may be
assumed at pleasure. But in these stratagems
I had no faith; so I determined to tell my story
plainly, simply, and candidly, to my gentle
sweetheart, Harriet.</p>

<p>I found her as directed; and, after a few of
those soft nothings, of which the early part of
an English conversation is generally composed,
drew her towards <i>the</i> subject, and eventually
told her, almost verbatim, what I had told her
father, adding that he was then actually engaged
with her mother in discussing the affair.</p>

<p>"But why discuss it at all?" said Harriet,
fixing her soft blue eyes on mine: "if you
would stay in England, we should be as happy
as the day were long, with your present income.
What do <i>we</i> want, that a small income will not
furnish? I have been used to the life you see us
leading here&mdash;I seek no other; and here we are
always sure of shelter and welcome."</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest," said I; "but life is transient
and short, and the day will come when all this

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

scene must be changed, and some successor&mdash;as
your father so well describes, in his story of the
Glanberry rector&mdash;will come, and assume the
mastery.</p>

<p>"True: but," said Harriet, her eyes filling
with tears at the bare allusion to the death of
her beloved father, "that is surely not to happen 
yet; besides, we can have a happy home
even without this&mdash;our own favourite cottage
with the woodbines."</p>

<p>"Cottages sound well in poetry," said I, "and
woodbines are bright and fragrant in summer;
but when winter comes, they are nipped, and
die; and when age creeps on, cottages and
casements become unfitting adjuncts to a happy
life. Besides, Harriet, duty, brotherly love,
and a desire to restore myself to the good opinion 
of one whose affection I have nearly lost,
urge me to the voyage."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gilbert," said Harriet, "think of the
perils of the sea, the duration of your misery:
pent within the ribs of a frail ship, exposed

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

to Storms, and to all the casualties of the
deep!"</p>

<p>"They are trifles," said I.</p>

<p>"No, no, Gilbert, they are not trifles," said
Harriet; "and my poor heart would beat and
bleed for fear and wretchedness, were you to
encounter death and danger in their most awful
forms for my sake. But if it be for your honour,
for your fame, for your advantage&mdash;nay, dear
Gilbert, if it be for your pleasure, that I should
share all these with you, I am ready to embark
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The noble generosity of the gentle girl, rising
gradually from timidity to heroism, with the
warmth and kindness of her feelings, completely
overcame me. I caught her to my heart, and
kissed the sweet lips over which such proofs
of affection and devotion had flowed. It was
at that moment she won my heart for ever&mdash;conduct 
which I confess I had, upon trivial
occasions, thought trifling; coldness which I
had at some times noticed as indicative of want

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

of sensibility; and levity which I had misconstrued
into an indifference towards me and my affairs,
were all obliterated by this burst of womanly
devotion.</p>

<p>I had carried my point. She had voluntarily
agreed to share my fate; and Wells and his wife
entering the room at the moment, it may easily
be imagined I lost no time in communicating
my triumphant success.</p>

<p>"I wish, Gilbert," said Wells, "that I could
reciprocate your exultation, or even permit you
to enjoy the satisfaction which I see expressed
in your countenance. I told you we must reserve 
a veto upon Harriet's decision, and I am
obliged to exert the power. Her mother will
not hear of it."</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, looking anxiously at Mrs.
Wells.</p>

<p>"It is so, Mr. Gurney," said the lady, in a
tone "more of sorrow than of anger." "I have
lost two sisters in India. It is a subject upon
which I never touch; but it was the severest blow
I ever encountered, and under circumstances

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

which it is not worth while now to explain. You
may be sure that these events have some influence 
upon my mind upon this occasion. But in
addition to these, I have, really under the apprehension 
that some such proposition might be
made, consulted our medical man on the point,
and he is decidedly of opinion, that Harriet's
life, like those of her dear aunts, would be
sacrificed by a residence in a hot climate."</p>

<p>"But, my dear mother," said Harriet, "if
Gilbert goes, <i>he</i> risks his life. We are pledged
to each other; why should I not share the
dangers which he feels it right, and just, and
honourable to encounter? Suppose, mamma,"
continued the animated girl, "suppose we had
been married a month since,"&mdash;and the supposition 
was followed by a crimson blush upon her
cheeks,&mdash;"and he had received the letters to-day
which have actually reached him, and determined
his course, should I have abstained from accompanying 
him then, if he had wished me to be
with him?"</p>

<p>"No, my love," said Mr. Wells, "nor should

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

you; nor would you, in the present case, had
not a medical opinion been so decidedly expressed 
upon the subject. But I am sure Gilbert 
is not a man likely to take advantage of
the influence he has over you, to induce you to
hazard your life for the gratification of any personal 
feeling of his own."</p>

<p>The manner in which this was put silenced
me. I really knew not how to act. Most true
it was that I felt the positive necessity for going.
If I went, it was of vital importance I should
go forthwith. It now appeared that delay
would be unavailing, because the constitutional
predisposition, whatever it might be, which was
to prohibit Harriet's visiting India now, would
be equally an objection a month or two hence.</p>

<p>Oh how true it is, that we never know the value
of a thing till it is lost, or in jeopardy. With
health, and wealth, and everything covetable and
desirable, it is the same. Twelve hours before,
I had no conception how deeply I was interested
in Harriet Wells. I could almost jokingly have
talked of giving her up; and here, now that it

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

seemed I was likely to lose her, I thought my
very heart would have broken.</p>

<p>I never shall forget the expression of Harriet's
countenance when her mother gravely and solemnly 
pronounced the refusal of her consent to
the voyage. She neither burst into tears, nor
screamed, nor raved, nor fainted: she sat on her
chair, like a statue, as pale as marble, her lips
firmly closed, and her hands strongly clenched.
There was in her countenance an expression of
positive, fixed determination, in which, accustomed 
only to see her sweet, playful smile, and
unclouded brow, there seemed something awful.
This conflict with herself, this concentration of
her energies, proved too much for her; and
suddenly rising from her seat, she rushed out of
the room, in a state to me the most alarming
and painful. Her mother followed her, and
Wells and I were again alone.</p>

<p>"This is a sad business," said Wells. "But
even were I to add the weight of my influence
to your entreaties and Harriet's wishes, what
would it be in the scale against her mother's

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

objections&mdash;objections strong and reasonable in
themselves, and supported by a special opinion
upon the particular case. Think, Gilbert,
what would our feelings be&mdash;what your own&mdash;were 
we to hear that our dear good child
had become the victim of a calamity, against
which, being fore-warned, we ought to have been
fore-armed."</p>

<p>To this appeal, delivered in the kindest and
most affectionate manner, what reply could I
make, what further remonstrance could I offer?
He saw that he had touched the right chord;
and it was clear to me, that whatever activity he
might have displayed in securing a husband for
his daughter in the first instance, he was equally
determined with his lady not to risk her safety
by the fulfilment of our engagement, coupled
with the proposed condition of emigration.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells added to what he had already said,
a request that I would for the present return to
Mr. Nubley's, where I should hear from him in
the course of the afternoon, expressing his opinion 
that Harriet ought to be kept quiet and

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

undisturbed by any further agitation of the subject 
at present. I assented to his proposition,
and quitted the rectory with a heavy heart; and
on my way back to Nubley's began strangely to
weaver in my resolution about the voyage. However, 
upon my arrival, I found that the indolent
Mr. Nubley had contrived, upon this special
occasion, not only to write, but despatch by a
cross post, a letter, announcing to a friend of his
my desire to secure a passage in his fine ship,
the Ramchoondra, of nine hundred and seventy
tons; that he was most anxious for my good
accommodation; describing moreover the situation 
which I was going to fill; and winding up
his lengthened eulogium by announcing my
name, and connexion with the eminent house
of which he himself had been the head. With
such an <i>avant courier</i>, who could doubt that I
was destined to enjoy every convenience and
luxury which the Ramchoondra could afford.</p>

<p>At any other time this extraordinary instance
of kindness and activity on the part of Mr.
Nubley would have received, as it certainly

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

merited, my warmest gratitude. But upon the
present occasion, so far from feeling pleased or
obliged to the worthy man, I could have killed
him for his vivacity.</p>

<p>I related to him all that had passed at the
parsonage, which he received with sundry noises
and moanings. "I thought so," said he&mdash;"good
job too&mdash;eh&mdash;pretty girl, I admit&mdash;sad incumbrance&mdash;no 
use taking them to India&mdash;all get
sick, and white, and old&mdash;quite forget her in
a month."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Sir," said I, "that I should
violate my engagement?"</p>

<p>"Eh," said Nubley&mdash;"no&mdash;not violate&mdash;what&mdash;oh 
dear no&mdash;don't do anything ungenteel&mdash;only&mdash;what 
I say is&mdash;wait&mdash;she is very young&mdash;you 
are not very old&mdash;marry when you come
back&mdash;that was my advice before, so it is
now."</p>

<p>"It appears to me extremely probable," said
I, "that I shall be compelled to follow it."</p>

<p>"When d'ye go to town,"&mdash;said Nubley&mdash;"to-morrow&mdash;eh?"&mdash;and 
then he thought&mdash;"If

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

I don't get him off at once he won't stir."&mdash;"The 
ship will sail in less than a week&mdash;not
much time for buying slops&mdash;and things."</p>

<p>"I know all about that," said I. "I have
already been to those shops&mdash;that will not take
me much time&mdash;but it is quite impossible I
should leave this place in the present position
of affairs."</p>

<p>"Oh," drawled Nubley&mdash;"what, it is neither
on nor off&mdash;what we at Calcutta used to call
neither my eye nor my elbow&mdash;shilly, shally&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir," said I, indignantly; "I have nothing 
to complain of in the conduct of any of
the parties concerned&mdash;on the contrary, they
have all behaved with honour and kindness&mdash;I 
cannot expect them to sacrifice a darling child
at my will and pleasure."</p>

<p>"Sacrifice a tom-tit," said Nubley&mdash;"they
are just playing fast and loose to try you&mdash;take 
my advice, go to town per mail to-night&mdash;you 
can come back here on your way to Portsmouth&mdash;you'll 
see the difference&mdash;I remember

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

a play in my boyish days&mdash;I forget what it was
called&mdash;and who wrote it&mdash;but there was a
young woman and a wheatsheaf, and an old
woman and a spinning wheel, and a squire
covered with leaves like the children in the
wood, and one of the people sang a song
which said&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Mind your sickle, let her be,
By and by she'll follow thee.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"Follow, Sir," said I, "she, Miss Wells,
would not wait to follow, she would gladly be
the partner of my voyage and my fate."</p>

<p>"Would she?" said Nubley&mdash;"then she will&mdash;you'll 
have a favourable answer."</p>

<p>"No, no, it may not be," said I, "and how
to act I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Why, if you have a spark of feeling," said
Nubley, "or a grain of sense, you'll go to your
brother&mdash;I have laid a train for the whole
affair&mdash;you'll be treated like a nabob in the
Ramchoondra, and ten to one, if these people
throw you over, you'll fall in with some deuced
pretty girls aboard, who will drive this little

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

woman clean out of your head;"&mdash;and then he
thought&mdash;"and a devilish good job too."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," said I, "I will not discuss the
matter at present. I am to hear in the course
of the afternoon from Mr. Wells, and by the
contents of his letter I will regulate the time of
my departure."</p>

<p>"Now there you talk sense," said Nubley&mdash;"your 
departure is certain&mdash;all that remains
doubtful is the time at which you are to go"&mdash;"and 
a very pretty affair too&mdash;what a silly fellow
to put it off till his brother married that Mrs.
Falwasser&mdash;she'll worry him to death, poor devil&mdash;umph, 
no business of mine."</p>

<p>This last was as usual intended for a soliloquy&mdash;and 
at its conclusion Nubley went out
muttering something about tiffin&mdash;and tallow&mdash;Madeira 
wine, and mull-mulls&mdash;leaving me
to reflections of no very agreeable character or
complexion.</p>

<p>It was about four o'clock when I received the
following letter from Mr. Wells, according to
his promise&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

<p class="right"><i>Rectory, half-past</i> 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Gilbert</span>,</p>

<p>Our poor child is extremely ill, and in a
state not to be disturbed by the agitation of any
such question as that which unhappily occupies
our attention at this moment. I feel perfectly
satisfied that your course is to proceed to your
brother&mdash;I have long since told you I held
that opinion, and whatever may be the sacrifices
which I and my family may be called upon
to make, rely upon it we shall be the last to
advise or suggest a relinquishment of your
expedition.</p>

<p>As to poor Harriet's going to India&mdash;a circumstance 
which, in our happier days, we have
referred to rather as a joke than a certainty&mdash;I 
once for all announce to you its entire impossibility.&mdash;What 
with her mother's feelings,
my own objections, and the positive opinion of
the physician, we should, even supposing his
prognostications to prove ill-founded, be placing
her in a situation of unnecessary risk and peril,

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

and ourselves in a life of perpetual misery,
anxiety, and uneasiness.</p>

<p>Think this over, and I am sure you will see
the necessity of leaving her to our care and to
the effects of that care and time to soothe or
heal a sorrow and disappointment, which will,
I apprehend, be of serious importance to her
health as well as happiness. If there were a
chance of your return in any reasonable time, it
would be my pride and happiness to continue
to consider you as her accepted lover, and my
future son-in-law; but engagements of that nature 
I think are best left to the parties most interested. 
All I can say is, that no objection will
be opposed to your maintaining your claim upon
her hand; nor is there the remotest probability
of the impression you have made being obliterated 
or superseded during your absence:&mdash;a
more simple, kind, and affectionate heart does not
beat in human breast, than that of my poor dear
child, whose situation claims all our interest, and
demands all our tenderness. I only repeat, because 
it is best to be at once decisive upon the

<!-- vol 3 page 285 -->

point, that to India no power on earth will induce
us to let her go. I leave it to your honour and
good feeling to take this statement as final.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nubley has been here, and tells Mrs.
Wells that Mr. Nubley has already written with
regard to your accommodation on board an East
Indiaman; and that the question now only is, at
what hour you take your departure from this
place for London. She also says you return here
on your way to Portsmouth. Under these circumstances, 
I would suggest your leaving it as
early as convenient. It is impossible that you
should see my poor child, even if you protracted
your stay here for a day or two. She is terribly
shaken. I would, therefore suggest, that you
should write to me from London, giving me an
insight into your plans; and if you should be
content with all I can, as a parent, offer, we shall
see you again when you return&mdash;Harriet's mind
will by that time, I trust, be fortified so as to
bear the interview and separation, and be satisfied
with a life of hope till brighter days shall come.</p>

<p>I feel most sensitively the difficulty and delicacy

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

of our position; but the esteem and regard I
entertain for you&mdash;the anxiety I feel that you
should do well, and prosper in all the essentials
of the world, induce me to speak openly, fairly,
and candidly, upon a subject with which I am
assured your happiness is nearly connected, and
in which mine is wholly locked up.</p>

<p>Do not answer this; but write to me from
London, and direct your letter to be left at the
post-office. In the state to which Harriet is reduced, 
the abrupt arrival of a letter from you
might produce <i>serious</i> effects. Believe me&mdash;let
our connection terminate as it may&mdash;yours, my
dear Gilbert, faithfully and sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. Wells</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>This letter, which was as much, nay, more
than I could expect, was anything but satisfactory 
to me, whose attachment to Harriet had
so violently increased in consequence of the
conviction of her devotion to me, which I had
derived from her conduct in the morning, as very
nearly to drive me to a final and formal abandonment 

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

of my speculative scheme, and a declaration 
of my resolution to marry the dear girl, and
live upon love. However, Nubley's mingled
severity and incredulity, drove me into the
other and more prudential course; and growing
feverishly sick of the neighbourhood of the rectory, 
and the atmosphere of Chittagong Lodge, I
availed myself of a vacant seat in the London
mail, which passed close to the lodges of the
park; and by eleven o'clock at night was rolling
along the road to London, having taken an
affectionate leave of my hospitable host and
hostess, who concluded her lengthened farewell
by wondering how I could run away from so
pretty a girl, who was so desperately in love
with me&mdash;an observation which procured her
the epithet of "fool" from her husband, who
squeezed my hand at parting, and told me I
should hear from him the following day.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> generally happens, providentially, that at
seasons when we are afflicted with griefs and
sorrows, the very circumstances connected with
them, compel us to exert ourselves in worldly
matters, so that the inevitable excitement serves
as a diversion from the sad subjects which would
otherwise wholly engross and probably overcome 
us.</p>

<p>From the moment of my arrival in London,
until the day when I should return to Chittagong
Lodge, on my circuitous route to Portsmouth, to
embark in the Honourable East India Company's 
ship, the Ramchoondra, every day and
every hour of each day was parcelled out and

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

divided for the transaction of some business
connected with my enterprise. During the night
of my journey, I admit that my brain was maddened 
by the complexity of thoughts which were
running through it; but even then sleep came to
my aid: emulating the heroes of Newgate and
the Tower, who have been shaken out of a slumber 
to mount the scaffold, it was necessary for
the guard, on our arrival at the White Horse
Cellar, to nudge me not gently, in order to
rouse me to a sense of my situation.</p>

<p>Tired nature, however, when refreshed, became 
obnoxious to all the "ills that flesh is heir
to;" and when I awoke, confused and astounded
by the suddenness of the appeal, and found myself 
sitting at the corner of Berkeley Street,
with a day beginning at a quarter after six before
me, of which I was just conscious that I had but
two or three available in England, I really felt
bewildered&mdash;the tenderness and firmness of Harriet 
Wells had completely overset me&mdash;I
did not expect such noble, charming conduct.

<!-- vol 3 page 290 -->

I would have given worlds, as I got out of the
mail, to have got into the first morning coach
downwards, renounced my design, and abandoned 
all my fine prospects, and acceded to her
sweet, woman-like proposition, of living contented 
upon what we had.</p>

<p>How much do men sacrifice to the world!&mdash;how 
much do they yield to the opinions of others.
I felt that if I now faltered in my resolution to
go to my brother, Nubley would set me down
for an idler&mdash;a waverer&mdash;in short, a vagabond;
and Cuthbert's not very favourable impression
received from Mrs. Pillman, would be strengthened 
and confirmed by the representations of my
new friend; but Harriet, for whom, as I have
already said, I before fancied I cared but little,
had won me&mdash;fascinated&mdash;enchained me.</p>

<p>However, <i>I</i> had decided&mdash;so had Wells and
his wife; and go <i>I</i> must&mdash;and go Harriet must
<i>not;</i> and all I had to do was to live on in hopes
and in love: for as to my affections taking the
course which my dingy friend of Chittagong

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

Lodge predicted, it was absurd beyond belief.
My heart could now know <i>no</i> change&mdash;and as
Sheridan says&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Least of all such change as they would give it;"</p>

</div>

<p>and, accordingly, I whiled away time till the
world was "a foot," and till my most active
man had knocked up my landlady&mdash;indeed,
being called at half-past six, in London, is enough
to knock up anybody&mdash;and got things as comfortable 
as he could, and prepared breakfast:
during which interval I dissipated my cares and
shook off my sleep, by walking to Hyde Park
Corner, and so down the Green Park and Constitution 
Hill, to my lodgings.</p>

<p>When I announced to the poor lady who kept
the house my design of immediately starting for
India, she endeavoured to dissuade me from so
rash an undertaking, because a nephew of hers
had been killed at Majorca; and my worthy and
trusty servant, who never fancied I should
really undertake such an astounding enterprise,
joined in her entreaties to me to desist from

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

such a perilous undertaking, because his own
brother's wife's sister's son had been drowned in
a gale of wind in Chelsea Reach. These facts
unnerved me as I sipped my tea at breakfast;
but at ten o'clock "I was a man again!"&mdash;and, 
as my dear good friend, old Firkins, said of
the hole in his inexpressibles, "I was surprised
at my own presence of mind."</p>

<p>Well, to the city I went: to Broad Street, to
the agents; to St. Mary Axe, to Favell and
Bousfield's, took my old catalogue of slops, and
fitted myself out. White jackets and calico
shirts at per hundred; and, as Hull would have
said, thousands of stockings and millions of
neckcloths, all of which the worthy people promised 
should be packed up and packed off in
the course of <i>that</i> forenoon, and in five hours
more be stowed away on board of the Honourable 
Company's ship Ramchoondra, then lying
off Gravesend, being to go round on the Tuesday
morning to St. Helens, thence to begin her
voyage, with a fresh departure.</p>

<p>Having thus expeditiously arranged this

<!-- vol 3 page 293 -->

affair, I went to the Jerusalem Coffee House&mdash;
a place strangely combined in my fancy with
artichokes and old clothes-men, and there saw
my captain, who looked as much like a captain
as he did like a coal-heaver. However, he was
very civil&mdash;told me he had got Mr. Nubley's
letter&mdash;that he had sent off to the ship to prepare 
me a comfortable berth&mdash;death to me!&mdash;and 
informed me that as the weather would
be hot for a considerable time, he had selected
one of the poop cabins for me, with a view of
giving me plenty of air.</p>

<p>This particular mark of civility&mdash;not then
understanding much of naval architecture&mdash;I
did not exactly comprehend; but made a bow of
gratitude for his kind intentions, the sincerity
of which, however, I began to doubt, when he
added, that the cabin he had so chosen was the
"starboard booby-hutch."</p>

<p>All this I subsequently discovered to be cant,
or technicality, and found the cabin an extremely
nice one, looking out on the quarter-deck, through
jalousies, or blinds, and having a port on the

<!-- vol 3 page 294 -->

quarter,&mdash;in fact, one of the nicest residences
for a single gentleman afloat that could be
imagined. The captain, moreover, furnished
me with a list of his passengers, which I read
with much interest, in the hope that some one of
them might have been somehow known to me
before, but I was disappointed. There were in
the list, a judge and his lady, a colonel
commandant of a regiment, his wife and children, 
a chaplain, two captains, three lieutenants, 
two ensigns for the King's service, three
writers, and four cadets for the Company; and
then there were&mdash;Miss Hobkirk, two Misses
Twiggle, two Misses Scropps, Miss Amelia
Scratchum, going to join her sister, Mrs.
M'Itchem, Miss Louisa Spokes, and four Misses
Warts. I had heard that the Company's ships
were so well served that they were called floating 
taverns, but this Ramchoondra seemed to
me more like a floating boarding-school.</p>

<p>The captain saw me smile at the list of ladies,
and said, "Now, Mr. Gurney, there is one thing
which it will be as well to tell you at starting,&mdash;All

<!-- vol 3 page 295 -->

these young ladies are under my personal protection, 
and for their comfort and respectability
I make such rules on board as I conceive right
and proper. I do not permit the young men,
during the passage, to walk on the same side
of the deck with the young ladies while they
are out taking their airings&mdash;of course I vary
my regulations as I see fit; but I am sure you
will not, under any circumstances, counteract
my exertions for their advantage. You know I
have full sovereign authority when we are
afloat; any thing like insubordination&mdash;I care
not in what quarter it arises&mdash;I put down
with a strong hand. I have the power of inflicting 
personal restraint where there is an
infraction of discipline. I can put my refractory 
passengers in irons, and have done it before
now. I certainly do all I can to render that
restraint as little irksome as possible, and have
had my fetters covered with green baize; but I
am not to be trifled with&mdash;the honour, virtue,
and character of all these young ladies are committed 

<!-- vol 3 page 296 -->

to my care, and I <i>will</i> maintain them at
the risk of my life."</p>

<p>I stared at him&mdash;the idea of the nature of the
cargo, and of the responsibility, and the fetters,
and all the rest of it&mdash;a cargo which no office
in the world, I suppose, would venture to insure,
startled me. I could say but little in reply
to all his cautions. I felt that at least they
were, as far as I was concerned, perfectly superfluous; 
so I shook hands with him, and
departed from the Coffee House, he having
acquainted me that he had no demand upon me
for passage money, Mr. Nubley having informed
him that my brother would settle that account
upon our arrival at Calcutta, and having, moreover, 
impressed upon my mind the absolute
necessity of being at Portsmouth on the following 
Thursday, at the latest, as the convoy were
actually waiting the arrival of the two last
ships from the river, one of which was the
Ramchoondra.</p>

<p>When I left this worthy man, for so he really

<!-- vol 3 page 297 -->

and truly was, I found myself enlightened upon
subjects entirely new to me. My abstract notions 
of a ship had previously combined something 
dirty, and pitch-smelling, and smoky below
and wet above; and when I heard of etiquette,
and distinction of sides, while the ladies were
taking their walks, and all that attention to the
rules of decorum, infinitely more rigid than the
most rigid observers of propriety would require
on shore, I was astonished. As for the girls, they
might walk or not,&mdash;<i>my</i> heart was cased in steel,
and my passions and feelings would live upon the
recollection of my Harriet; that is to say, if
when I saw her on my way back, her parents
would not relent, or she decide. But then
what time had we for preparation?&mdash;to be sure
there might be some female Favells and Bousfields 
at Portsmouth, who would provide a
lady's wardrobe as speedily as mine was prepared 
in London. But these were vain hopes.
I knew her parents had made up their minds
she should stay, and I was quite sure, under

<!-- vol 3 page 298 -->

these circumstances, their child would not make
up her mind to go.</p>

<p>Well, the two days passed, and the third
dawned, on which I was to quit the huge, foggy,
smoky city, in which I had first drawn my
breath, perhaps and in all probability, never
to return to it. I called on Hull, he was in the
country; I called at Daly's lodgings, in Duke
Street; not only was he gone, but the shop was
shut up over which he had lived. I dined at
Dejex's&mdash;my last dinner; every thing as usual,
but how changed to me. My eyes lingered
on the rayed clock over the fire-place, which I
had remembered from my days of boyhood: it
seemed to me the type of my career&mdash;my sun was
setting, as far as England was concerned; and I
walked out of the coffee-house, and roamed about
the streets looking at the moon&mdash;the moon which,
when but a few days younger, I had gazed on
with Harriet, but which now was ever and anon
hidden by patches of black cloud, blown by a
sharpish wind between us,&mdash;the brightness of

<!-- vol 3 page 299 -->

the one reminding me of past pleasures, and the
fitful wildness of the other filling me with forebodings 
of the trials to come.</p>

<p>On the third morning after my arrival, I paid
all my very small outstanding bills, and parted
with my most excellent servant, whose devotion
to me was sadly overbalanced by an aversion
from the sea, and a dread of the voyage, which
no representation of mine could possibly overcome. 
I regretted the separation, for he was an
excellent fellow, and had been my servant ever
since I was old enough to possess exclusively such
a functionary. However, I might as well have endeavoured 
to persuade a cat to take the water,
and therefore leaving him to die on dry land, I
embarked in one of what we then fancied fast
coaches, on my return to Mr. Nubley's, and on
my way to Portsmouth&mdash;to that Portsmouth
which had been the scene of my former jokes
and jollities, but which henceforth was to be
remembered as the last point of parting between
me and all that I held dear.</p>

<p>There were three other passengers in the

<!-- vol 3 page 300 -->

stage, and, at any other time, I should have
listened to their communications, and culled
amusement from their absurdities; but now, I
had no time for these. My hours of travel were
occupied in considering what course I should
pursue with my reverend father-in-law elect. I
would not for the world&mdash;I could not for the world,
for I never was selfish&mdash;have persuaded Harriet
to risk her life, and disobey her parents, by
either insisting on her accompanying me, or
of taking the strong measure of following
me; and yet, when I saw her, in the agonies
of separation from me&mdash;and this I knew
and felt I should see, without inculpating
myself in a charge of vanity, after what I <i>had</i>
already witnessed in her conduct towards me&mdash;what 
could I do?&mdash;how could I act? I had
pledged myself to Wells upon the point; and,
let the struggle be what it might, I resolved,
please God, to redeem that pledge.</p>

<p>It has often been a question with me, whether
our hours of happiness or sorrow fly the quicker.
The doubt sounds odd; but I have passed many

<!-- vol 3 page 301 -->

of both, and yet the doubt remains. I found
myself at the turning to Chittagong Lodge long
before I expected it, and a few minutes more
brought me into the presence of that good, but
most eccentric creature, its worthy master.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, as little moved by my re-appearance 
in so short a time from my departure,
as if I had only been into the next room,&mdash;"I
have heard from your captain&mdash;all settled&mdash;eh?&mdash;good 
cabin&mdash;capital living&mdash;every attention
paid you&mdash;more comfortable than ever you was
in your life&mdash;wise thing you have done."</p>

<p>"If it had not been done off hand," said I,
"it never would have been done at all;&mdash;if I
am to take physic, I see no kind of advantage in
standing smelling to it for an hour. Is Mrs.
Nubley quite well, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Ugh," said Nubley,&mdash;"well!&mdash;what should
be the matter with her?&mdash;a constitution proved
at Calcutta&mdash;she is as thin, and as dry as a
Bombay duck."</p>

<p>"And the Wellses, Sir?" said I.</p>

<p>"The Wellses," said Nubley,&mdash;"oh! dear

<!-- vol 3 page 302 -->

me, I had quite forgot&mdash;I have got a letter for
you from Miss Wells&mdash;eh&mdash;dear, where <i>did</i> I
put it to?&mdash;I hope I hav'n't burnt it&mdash;or sent it
up to the agents in London by mistake&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"A letter, Sir," said I; "why a letter?&mdash;I
hope in less than half an hour to see her&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor devil! he's done," muttered Nubley.
"You won't see much of the Wellses here,"
said he;&mdash;"they are gone&mdash;fled&mdash;you have put
up the whole covey after winging your bird."</p>

<p>"I do not comprehend you," said I.</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Nubley, staring at me
with the most unmeaning expression of countenance&mdash;"I 
wonder at that&mdash;they are gone to
his sister's, in the New Forest."</p>

<p>"What can be the object of such an expedition?" 
said I.</p>

<p>"To get out of your way," replied my friend,
who had been all this time poking and rummaging
amongst a heap of papers on his library table.&mdash;
"Oh!&mdash;here's the letter&mdash;that, I suppose, will explain 
all&mdash;I think Wells has acted like a sensible

<!-- vol 3 page 303 -->

man, and I hope you'll do the same"&mdash;"not that
I think you will"&mdash;(in the sequel.)</p>

<p>I was too much affected by the intelligence of
their departure, evidently caused, as Nubley
said, by the desire of avoiding me, and by the
receipt of the first letter I had ever received
from Harriet, and which, from all I could see,
promised to be the last and only one I ever
should receive, to break its seal before a witness; 
I therefore quitted the library, and ran
to my own room, where I tore open the envelope, 
and read these words:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gilbert</span>,</p>

<p>I write this with the consent, and even at the
desire, of my father and mother. They warmly
and tenderly enter into our feelings; but, having
decided upon this course, they have thought it
better that we should not meet again&mdash;at least
<i>before your voyage</i>. God will, I trust, give me
strength and power to obey their commands, and
forego the melancholy satisfaction of bidding you

<!-- vol 3 page 304 -->

a long, but, oh! let me hope and pray, not a
last, adieu.</p>

<p>That you should do that which is right and
just, and what your best friends think ought to
be done, is exactly what I wish and desire; and,
above all do I wish and desire it, because a
failure, on your part, at the present moment,
might be productive, in addition to mere worldly
loss, of a disunion between you and your nearest
and dearest relation. I own that I talked the
language of my heart, when I urged your stay
here upon a more moderate income, which I am
sure, knowing myself, would afford us all the
comforts of humble and domestic life; but I
have thought, I have taken counsel of my excellent 
parents, and I feel, that to urge this
course upon you, or even to permit you to follow
it for <i>my</i> sake, would be the height of selfishness. 
Could I ever be happy, my dear Gilbert,
if I found myself hereafter the cause of your
estrangement from your brother's affections?&mdash;No;&mdash;you 
shall see that I can make a sacrifice

<!-- vol 3 page 305 -->

of my feelings&mdash;of my happiness&mdash;to sincere
affection, and a sense of duty. Follow my humble 
example;&mdash;go,&mdash;be rich,&mdash;be happy, and
continue to be beloved by him, whose affectionate 
anxiety for your welfare demands a willing 
obedience to his wishes.</p>

<p>I can scarcely write&mdash;but you will forgive me:
remember, my stay in England is a sacrifice to
duty&mdash;my going, my mother says, would break
her heart. Can I, dare I, quit <i>her</i>, who for
twenty years has watched over me, prayed for
me, and taught me, not less by precept than
example, to know the duties of my station,
and to fulfil them to the best of my ability?
Dare I offend her&mdash;or even if I dare, for <i>your</i>
sake, disobey injunctions which her tenderness
and love of me have laid upon me&mdash;can I risk
her happiness, perhaps her life, by persisting in
my earnest wish to accompany you?</p>

<p>I repeat my prayers, that I may be able to
maintain the resolution to which I have come;
it is because I have made that resolution, that
my father thinks our meeting again an event

<!-- vol 3 page 306 -->

to be avoided. It sounds cruel; but I know
his heart, and am assured that his conduct
is regulated by nothing but kindness. I
think seeing you again, only to be separated, 
would break my heart. Now the blow
<i>has</i> fallen, and you are lost to me; I live
upon the memory of days that are past, and
will live, dearest Gilbert, on the hopes of those
which are yet to come.</p>

<p>Write to me, if I may encourage that feeling; 
bid me linger on through a life of seclusion,
till your return; tell me that you do not doubt
or mistrust my affection, because I have adopted
the resolution I now announce to you. Return&mdash;return 
to me, and you shall find the heart that you
have won as purely and entirely your own as it
is at this minute. My poor head aches, and
my eyes are sore with crying. If I were to
write volumes, I could not say more&mdash;only
be convinced of my truth&mdash;my sincerity&mdash;my
love.</p>

<p class="right">Yours, ever yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Harriet</span>.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 307 -->

<p>Write before you sail, and send me some
trifling remembrance&mdash;the plainer and simpler,
the better; that which I have inclosed, you
will perhaps sometimes look at; and do not fail
to let us hear of you the moment you arrive.
My father, mother&mdash;all&mdash;all of us, unite in
prayers and good wishes. God bless you!</p>

<br/>

<p>I had heard of the disinterestedness of women&mdash;of 
their self-devotion, their self-denial, and
their total disregard of self; but living, as I did,
not amongst the best, and having unfortunately
heard strange histories of the <i>worst</i>, I was not
prepared for this. I will not attempt to describe
what I felt, and I suppose I need not say
what I did: I wrote to her, and pledged myself 
to her eternally, thanking her a thousand
times for her generous and affectionate conduct,
and imploring her, for <i>my</i> sake, to calm her
feelings, and look forward with faith and confidence, 
until, by the blessing of Providence, I
should return and claim her hand, when I
might be more worthy of such a treasure, and

<!-- vol 3 page 308 -->

when the unqualified approbation and sanction
of her parents would render our union truly
happy.</p>

<p>All this I said&mdash;but it was half hypocrisy&mdash;if
that may be called hypocrisy which is merely a
disguise of one's real sentiments with the best of
motives. The dear girl had made a sacrifice,
which it was not likely I should undervalue: I
felt that I ought to reciprocate her noble feelings. 
If I had obeyed the impulse of my heart,
I should have followed her to her retreat, and
have implored her to abandon everything for
me; and it was evident, by her own mistrust
of herself, and her earnest appeal to Heaven for
support in her good intentions, that such an
expedition would have turned the scale in my
favour; but reason, and honour, and justice,
combined to point out to me the recklessness of
such a course. To repay a tribute of self-devotion, 
by the exhibition of so much selfishness 
as would induce the obedient child to violate
her filial duty; to estrange her from the home
and hearts of her affectionate parents; to keep

<!-- vol 3 page 309 -->

them in a state of perpetual dread and apprehension 
of the fatal consequences of her residence 
in India, and perhaps expose the dear
object of my devotion to the reality of the dangers 
they anticipated; no&mdash;the struggle was
great: but I triumphed. My heart was bursting
with grief and anxiety, but I sealed and despatched 
my grateful reply, and my apparently
sincere entreaties for her to be calm and patient,
and live on hope, at the very moment that her
compliance with my expressed wishes would doom
me to years of unhappiness, perhaps to eternal
misery.</p>

<p>I sent her the pledge she kindly asked&mdash;that
which she enclosed to me has never left my
bosom from the day it first reached my hand.</p>

<p>Lucky, indeed, was it that time pressed&mdash;that 
everything connected with my voyage and
departure was to be done in a hurry: all was
action&mdash;not a moment was left for reflection&mdash;in 
two days the Ramchoondra was to be at St.
Helens, if the wind permitted. The convoy, as
I have already said, were waiting for the East

<!-- vol 3 page 310 -->

Indiamen; and the commodore, with that ardent
zeal and activity, so characteristic of the service
of which he was an ornament, was one of a
school not likely to bear delay with much complacency. 
It was therefore understood, that in
twenty-four hours after the appearance of these
vessels, every fore topsail in the fleet would be
shaken out, and in less than twelve hours we
should all be scudding before a delightful easterly 
wind&mdash;conceive an easterly wind being
delightful&mdash;which had been blowing for ten
days.</p>

<p>The whole, of the forenoon after my arrival
at Chittagong Lodge, on the preceding evening,
was passed with my friend Mr. Nubley, who
gave me charge of an infinity of account books,
and papers of different sorts, all of which he
methodically arranged in a green box, which
he very carefully locked. In the sequel he
forgot to send the key with it, which, as
some of the papers it contained were to be
delivered to a merchant at Madeira, was rather
a drawback to my success as an accurate and

<!-- vol 3 page 311 -->

attentive agent. However, when the moment
came for parting, I found the old gentleman
all kindness and friendship, and admitting an
April sort of sensation at parting,&mdash;of satisfaction 
at my decision,&mdash;joy for the advantages
that awaited me, and regret at losing me,&mdash;all
of which sentiments I had occasion to find satisfactorily 
authenticated by his frequent audible
meditations during the last few hours of my
stay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nubley, who, during the thirty-six
hours of my sojourn under their roof, had kept
up a constant fire of jokes, after her fashion,
touching the separation of lovers, and my
cruelty, and all that sort of nonsense, which
had nearly driven me mad, shook hands with
me affectionately, and, I thought, put out her
very thin white lips in a recipient position for
a farewell salute.&mdash;Whether it was that I did
not take the hint, or that she was still harping
on Harriet, I do not know; but the very last
words I heard her exclaim, as I released my

<!-- vol 3 page 312 -->

hand from hers, were "Lauk, Gilbert, you are
such a man!&mdash;he, he, he, he!"</p>

<p>I had ordered the postchaise which was to
convey me to Portsmouth, to wait at the inn
till I came, and thither my portable luggage
was conveyed.&mdash;It may be easily guessed why
I did this; at least I think so. In my walk
into the village, I should pass the Parsonage:
was it likely I should go&mdash;perhaps, for ever&mdash;from 
the scene of my almost unconscious happiness, 
without&mdash;now that its purity and brightness 
had burst upon me&mdash;visiting it once
more?</p>

<p>I stopped&mdash;I entered the house which I had
heard ringing with innocent mirth, and honest
cheerfulness. All was still: the faithful Martha,
who opened the door, in the absence of the rest
of the establishment, looked at me, and without
a word from me, led the way to the dear
breakfast-room where I last had seen my
Harriet. She looked at my eyes&mdash;perhaps she
saw tears standing in them&mdash;what then!&mdash;I am

<!-- vol 3 page 313 -->

not ashamed of them&mdash;they fell; and I threw
myself into the chair in which I had last seen
my beloved Harriet, and buried my face in my
hands&mdash;when I raised my head I was alone.</p>

<p>That Martha, old and humble as she was,
must, at some time of her life, have felt deeply,
to have sympathized so readily, was quite clear.</p>

<p>Next to seeing the dear object of my love,&mdash;a 
love most serious and touching of all loves,
because founded upon esteem and friendship,
ripened into devotion by the merits and qualities 
of the beloved&mdash;that of again beholding
around me the books in which we had read
together&mdash;the harp near which I used to sit and
hear her play&mdash;the desk still covered by the
song which I had selected for her to sing&mdash;the
thousand little accessories all around me, was
most painfully interesting. I began to repent
that I had again ventured into the paradise
from which I had been driven; yet I believe it
did me good&mdash;my feelings had their way</p>

<p>On the wall of the drawing-room hung a
portrait of Harriet&mdash;it did not do her justice;

<!-- vol 3 page 314 -->

there were the features, but not the expression,
not the softness, the gentleness, through
which her mind beamed forth&mdash;yet it <i>was</i> a
likeness. I had always abused it&mdash;always
turned from it with anger, that the "cold,
limner," as Colman has it, could have made so
unimpassioned a copy of such an original. It
would now be worth worlds to me. I felt I had
a right to it&mdash;I felt a jealousy lest any other
man should even look on it, while I was away.
I took it from the nail on which it hung&mdash;I
kissed it a hundred times&mdash;I seemed to myself
to have achieved something&mdash;I rang the bell of
the drawing-room, and the aged Martha stood
before me.</p>

<p>"Martha," said I, "when the family return,
say I took this."</p>

<p>I showed her the picture.</p>

<p>"God send, Sir," said she, "that you had
taken the young lady herself, and all would
have been well"&mdash;and the poor creature sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>Guineas were scarce with me in those days,

<!-- vol 3 page 315 -->

but as I pressed the old woman's hand, I left
one on its palm, and hiding my treasure in the
bosom of my waistcoat, quitted the Parsonage
without another word!</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p class="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>I was again in Portsmouth&mdash;drove to the
George. The sight of Portsmouth, too, under
such totally different circumstances from those
under which I had previously visited it, gave
me a new pang. My first inquiry was, "Do
you know if the Ramchoondra East Indiaman
is arrived at St. Helen's, from the river?"</p>

<p>"Came to anchor about one o'clock to-day,
Sir," said the landlord; "several passengers
in the house, Sir, who are going by her,&mdash;the
captain has been here, Sir, and has ordered
dinner for the party&mdash;what name shall I say,
Sir?&mdash;he'll be too happy, Sir."</p>

<p>"Party&mdash;dinner!"&mdash;thought I. "What! are
the victims merry!&mdash;drunkenness before execution!&mdash;Gaiety&mdash;too 
happy to see me!" This
was enough.&mdash;I told the landlord that I would

<!-- vol 3 page 316 -->

come back&mdash;left no name, and "knowing my
Portsmouth," as the phrase goes, I procured
a barrow-man to wheel down everything but an
anonymous <i>sac de nuit</i>, to the point, and there,
according to Mr. Nubley's directions, procured
a good stiff wherry to take me and my light
luggage to the Honourable Company's Ship
Ramchoondra, which instead of being at St.
Helens, was comfortably hobbling herself about
at Spithead, not more than a mile from the
beach.</p>

<p>Then it was that I felt myself, with my two
trunks, my dressing-case, my writing-desk, two
or three odd boxes, the green box without the
key, some supplementary parcels, and what
elderly ladies in country towns call "odd-come-shorts," 
really afloat. Then it was, that I was
satisfied, not only that I had made up my mind
to a voyage to India, but to what had appeared
to me heretofore an affair of almost equal peril
and difficulty&mdash;to climb up the side of a huge
ship, with nothing to step upon but bits of sticks,
fitter for cocks and hens to walk upon than men

<!-- vol 3 page 317 -->

and women&mdash;with nothing to hold on by, but a
couple of bits of cord, handed to you, swinging
from one side to the other, the chance being
either that you did not catch them at all, or if
you did, the first effect they produced would
be to swing you off the infernal little ledges by
which it is expected you are to mount.</p>

<p>I was just in the humour to care for nothing.
It blew fresh, and just turning out by the battery,
slap came a sea right over the bows of the boat,
which made her shake, her gunwale being nearly
under water to leeward, and I the recipient of
more of the briny than I had ever seen detached
from the main body, directly in my face, the
little white horse having struck the bow, and
made a ricochet over the heads of the boatmen
into the stern-sheets. No matter; up we went,
and down we came, until at last we reached the
huge caravansary in which I was to be transported. 
Then came such a hollowing&mdash;"Boat
alongside,"&mdash;"hand 'em a rope,"&mdash;such a washing 
and splashing between us and the ship; such
poking, and fending, and squabbling, and boat-hooking, 

<!-- vol 3 page 318 -->

which ended in "Now, Sir," to me,&mdash;I 
at the same time bobbing and stretching to
catch two things like skipping-ropes, by the aid
of which I was, as I had anticipated, to help
myself up two pair of no-stairs into a thing as
big as a church, which was rolling away from
me whenever I tried to get footing.</p>

<p>However it was done. I broke my shin in
stepping over the gangway, and my hat blew off
the moment I touched the quarter-deck. Had
it been a king's ship, I should have thought
Nature had taken the trouble to teach me manners. 
However, after a hunt, in which several
facetious and active personages joined, my hat
was restored, and I was shown to the cuddy&mdash;a
very handsome slip of a room, with fawn-coloured
panels and gold mouldings, from which opened
upon the deck five windows, fitted with blinds;
and on the left of its entrance was my cabin,
which, as I have already said, was a very nice,
convenient, agreeable lodgment. I found my
chests and trunks, which had been deposited
there till I gave directions which to stow away

<!-- vol 3 page 319 -->

below, with a weekly permission to my servant
to have access to those which contained linen,
&amp;c., so that he might bring up the seven days'
supply.</p>

<p>I was quite agreeably disappointed with the
neatness and nicety of every thing I saw, and
the extraordinary attention and civility of all
the officers who spoke to me, in their different
degrees. I was asked whether I preferred a
cot or a standing bed-place.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Mine be a cot beside a hill,"</p>

</div>

<p>thought I; and then came visions of Harriet and
honeysuckles;&mdash;but the question puzzled me; a
cot I had heard of, but of a standing bed-place
never; and the term confounded me altogether.
I did not like to display my ignorance. Did they
mean, by a standing bed-place, a perpendicular
bed?&mdash;was I to sleep standing? They saw I did
not comprehend; so they carried me into a cabin,
where they pointed out a canvas-bag hung up
upon two hooks, which they told me was Miss
Anne Twiggle's cot; and then referred me to a

<!-- vol 3 page 320 -->

thing something like a dinner-tray, made of deal,
in the corner, which they informed me was "Miss
Fanny Twiggle's" standing bed-place.</p>

<p>I considered for a minute or two before I
would decide upon this really important matter;
and having made, even in smoothish water,
several experiments as to getting into a cot,
which is something like mounting a skittish
horse, I resolved upon the standing bed-place,
and was forthwith measured by the carpenter
for a bed after the fashion of Miss Fanny
Twiggle's dinner-tray.</p>

<p>During this discussion, nice as every thing
seemed, I began to feel very odd. I was not
conscious of any particular motion; but when
I was in the cuddy, where for the next five or
six months of my life I was to dine every day,
the sight of three lamps suspended over the
table, all hanging out of the right line, coming
back to it, and then dangling the other way with
a gentle inclination, made me wish, unless there
was an absolute necessity for remaining on board,
to get on shore as soon as possible. Altogether

<!-- vol 3 page 321 -->

I confess the prospect of the descent, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the
skipping-ropes, made me linger on in hope that
something&mdash;what I could not guess&mdash;would
happen, which certainly never could, to diminish
the relative distance between the deck of the
ship and the boat. This, however, it was vain
to expect; and so away I came&mdash;the side manned
for me&mdash;and down I partly slid, and partly tumbled, 
and was hurried aft by one of my crew;
affected to look pleased, took off my hat, made
a bow, and came back to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>One thing I had entirely made up my mind
to, which was, not to dine with the captain and
his passengers&mdash;those I should see every day for
the next half year; and the very notion of society,
labouring under feelings such as those which
occupied and oppressed me, was worse than
death. I had now seen the ship, I had been on
the poop, I had given orders for fitting up my
booby-hutch; my luggage, except my bag and
a few trifling articles which I could bring in the
morning, were on board, and I secretly resolved
not to return to the George until late in the

<!-- vol 3 page 322 -->

evening, so to escape the din and clatter of a
large party.</p>

<p>I had a project for passing two or three hours
much more in accordance with the present state
of my mind. The excellent, the kind, the
hospitable, friend, under whose roof I had passed
so many happy hours, and whence I was journeying 
in the memorable time of the Prince's boots,
had been suddenly and unexpectedly called
from this sublunary world about a twelvemonth
before the time of which I now speak. I felt
that it would afford me a melancholy pleasure to
visit those scenes of mirth in other days, and
although his remains were buried some hundred
miles thence, I could look upon the house, to
me once a home of happiness, with a veneration
and affection little inferior to those which the
sight of his tomb itself would have awakened.</p>

<p>Accordingly I directed my boatmen to set me
ashore on the Gosport side of the harbour&mdash;they
obeyed of course&mdash;and paying them the amount
of their demand for my trip, I proceeded along
the High Street to the village in which stood

<!-- vol 3 page 323 -->

the well-known mansion, determining on my return 
to get whatever dinner I had, in Gosport,
and cross the ferry, so as to reach the George
at a time when the captain and his passengers 
had retired, if not to rest, at least from
table.</p>

<p>I walked on, and every hedge and every tree
reminded me of foregone pleasures,&mdash;and I believe 
the very diversion of my thoughts, melancholy 
as the diversion was, from my poor, kind,
suffering Harriet did me good;&mdash;I cannot describe 
my feelings when I saw the house of my
poor friend&mdash;its door, always before open at my
approach, was sternly closed, and a sharp watchdog 
leaped to the top of the palings in front of
it to bark at me. I love dogs&mdash;and I loved this
dog for his watchfulness of his master's property&mdash;but 
I could not help feeling the change&mdash;I
stood and looked at the windows as one would
gaze on the features of an old acquaintance; I
walked round towards the sea, and saw the
billiard room, which seemed exactly as it was
when I saw it last&mdash;but it had passed into other

<!-- vol 3 page 324 -->

hands&mdash;I felt glad that I had made the pilgrimage, 
and walked back towards Gosport.</p>

<p>I had no appetite&mdash;I wanted no dinner&mdash;but
dinner is something that divides a day,&mdash;and certain 
it is that the six hours after dinner, be the
dinner what it may, pass incredibly faster than
the six hours before it,&mdash;I therefore resolved to
go through the forms, and happening to return
down the right-hand side of the street, I turned
into the India Arms, kept by one worthy Mrs.
Mullholland,&mdash;a name which, in cold weather,
would, in a seaport town, tempt an anchorite;&mdash;I 
asked if I could have anything to eat,&mdash;I 
was answered, of course, in the affirmative&mdash;I 
directed it, whatever it might be, to be got
ready in an hour, and continued my stroll.</p>

<p>A thousand times in my life I have found
this to happen&mdash;I have thought of a person of
whom I have not thought recently, and I have
seen that person curiously soon afterwards. As
I was strolling in a rather retired part of the
neighbourhood of the town, pending the preparation 
of my meal, I fell to thinking of Daly,

<!-- vol 3 page 325 -->

regretting that I had had no time to seek
him out during my short stay in London, and
resolving to write him a letter before I crossed
to Portsmouth. The thought had scarcely fleeted
through my brain, when, if ever I saw him in
my life, I saw Daly pop his head out of a
window on the first floor of a small house close
by the barracks. The instant he caught my eye
he hastily drew back, but, in the following
moment, he reappeared, and pointing downwards, 
with his finger, to the house door, shut
the window and again vanished.</p>

<p>I thought it was a vision&mdash;however I stopped
at the door, and, as soon as he could reach it,
Daly himself opened it.</p>

<p>"Come in&mdash;come in;" said he, "make haste&mdash;come 
in."</p>

<p>I obeyed&mdash;and followed him up stairs into a
small but neatly furnished drawing-room.</p>

<p>"What the deuce brings you here?" said he
to me.</p>

<p>"I echo the question?" said I.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 326 -->

<p>"Are you staying in the neighbourhood?"
inquired Daly.</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed I, "for one night; to-morrow
I embark for India."</p>

<p>And then commenced my narrative; which,
as lovers love to talk of themselves, and that
pretty lengthily too, I presume occupied some
considerable space of time. It then became <i>my</i>
turn to inquire.</p>

<p>"I," said Daly, "am regularly done&mdash;the
dividend we expected in Blinkinsop's business
is nil, and all I had of my own is gone.&mdash;Emma 
has returned to her mother, who is
living with her Major in some part of Ireland;
and I am going out with an appointment under
government, if I can escape the devils of fellows
who are after me."</p>

<p>"I hope it is a good office you have got,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Tolerable," said Daly, "they have given
me the Deputy Secretaryship at Sierra Leone."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 327 -->

<p>"I know what you mean," said Daly, "but
what could I do&mdash;it is a fine settlement for patronage; 
and if men succeed to death vacancies
as they do in the army, I have a good chance.
It is a sort of Tontine Colony, all for the benefit 
of survivors."</p>

<p>"I am sure I sincerely wish you may have
your health," said I, "but are you really so
hard up?"</p>

<p>"Hard up;" said Daly; "why, Sir, if
I could not have raised a few guineas, I
could not have got out. I borrowed three
hundred pounds of an accommodating friend
about three weeks ago, secured upon my salary&mdash;but 
when I came to have the money, I was
forced to take seventy pounds in cash, pay
sixty pounds interest, and receive the balance
in paving stones and blankets."</p>

<p>"You are joking," said I.</p>

<p>"Joking! no;" said Daly, "those days are
over, and so anxious was my friend to conclude
the bargain, and deliver the goods, that when I
came home the next evening, I found both my

<!-- vol 3 page 328 -->

rooms stuffed from carpet to ceiling with the
Witneys, and a pile of the paving stones in
front of my lodgings, looking like a full-sized
model of one of the pyramids. I was threatened 
with prosecution by the surveyor of pavements&mdash;menaced 
with an action by my landlord 
for overloading his floors,&mdash;and so egad I
was obliged to give another accommodating
friend twenty pounds out of my seventy, to
take my bargain off my hands."</p>

<p>"But, my dear friend," said I, "if you had
insured your life."</p>

<p>"I tried that, Gilbert," said Daly, "but I
am going to Sierra Leone."</p>

<p>And he said this with a mingled grief and
drollery, which gave me pain to hear. I turned
the conversation, by begging him to come and
dine with me at the India Arms.</p>

<p>"Me," said Daly, "I dare not stir out&mdash;I
am watched dodged&mdash;hunted&mdash;and my only
chance is getting on board to-night after dark
in the disguise of a sailor. The vengeance of my
few creditors is excited because they believe

<!-- vol 3 page 329 -->

that I was a party to the rascality of Blinkinsop;
while my wife, as you saw, on the other hand,
attributes to our marriage the explosion of his
affairs&mdash;so I am in a nice mess&mdash;and now, dear
Gurney, do not think me inhospitable or unkind,
or unmindful of other days&mdash;but&mdash;and I assure
you I would have seen nobody on earth but
yourself&mdash;leave me&mdash;you will be watched, and I
shall be traced&mdash;my only chance is escape&mdash;and&mdash;no 
matter what&mdash;anything better than staying
here.&mdash;You may depend upon it (and perhaps
these are the last words that we shall ever
exchange), what has happened to me is justice&mdash;I 
say no more&mdash;make yourself happy&mdash;you have
been saved from the embarrassments and entanglements 
into which I have fallen, and as to my
conduct, I believe the sentence upon me by a
just judge would be very much like that of the
coroner's jury upon the old woman, who stood
still to be run over on a race-ground&mdash;'It serves
me right'&mdash;God bless you&mdash;and if we ever meet
again, may it be in happier times to both of us."</p>

<p>I saw that my presence kept him in a state of

<!-- vol 3 page 330 -->

nervous agitation, and of course did not hesitate 
to comply with his wishes, and withdraw.
I cordially shook hands with him and we parted,
and I walked down to mine inn, comparing in
my mind the relative qualities of Emma Haines
and Harriet Wells.</p>

<p>I confess my spirits had not acquired any
great elevation in consequence of this interview.
I had seen a fellow of infinite jest and talent
doomed to certain death upon the pestiferous
shores of a colony founded in fallacy, and sustained 
by hypocrisy, by deceit and misrepresentation.&mdash;I 
had seen him reduced to positive
distress, duped and deluded by appearances, of
which too I might and should myself have been
the victim, if he had not, by conduct which I
did not stop to examine, nor he attempt to justify,
shifted the miseries from my shoulders on to his
own.</p>

<p>When I reached the India Arms, the first
exclamation I heard from a young damsel&mdash;Miss
Mullholland I presume, was&mdash;"here is the gentleman"&mdash;the 
echo of which, like that of Killarney, 

<!-- vol 3 page 331 -->

being "Well! his mackerel's boiled to
pieces"&mdash;both of which speeches induced me to
believe that I had considerably overstayed my
time, and kept the dinner waiting,&mdash;an offence 
to a cook, of whatever degree he or she
may be, utterly unpardonable, and only to be
equalled by that which the king of all kitchen 
men took at the conduct of a noble marquess,
who, when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, ventured
at his own dinner table, before company, to put
salt into a soup which the <i>artiste</i> had made.</p>

<p>The frown of the fair hand-maiden was not
rigid, and my little meal was served&mdash;for here
there was no coffee-room&mdash;in the bay windowed
drawing-room, which, from its size&mdash;the darkness
of the weather, and the wetting I had got in the
boat, appeared even at that time of year chilly.&mdash;I 
ventured to ask if I could have a fire lighted.
Pinafore stared, and the waiter was called into
council; it was however permitted, and although
I heard myself designated as one of those "fire
Indians" who never can be kept warm, I did
not care for the obloquy, but felt comforted by
the blaze.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 332 -->

<p>I dined&mdash;I drank some wine&mdash;but it was all
mere matter of course&mdash;my mind was full of
thoughts, reflections, and contemplations&mdash;confused 
and wild&mdash;in short, I believe I was half-crazy&mdash;but 
in the midst of this madness, the last
scene I had witnessed had made a strong impression 
upon me, and I felt that I had been remiss
in not offering some assistance to poor Daly,
which, even short as I was of cash, I might have
afforded. I therefore resolved upon revisiting
him now that it was dusk, in order to ascertain
whether a few guineas, if he would do me the
favour to borrow them, might be serviceable&mdash;I
rang the bell, and paid my bill&mdash;but knowing
that the orgies at Portsmouth were not likely
to terminate for two or three hours, desired the
waiter to keep up my fire, as I should return
shortly and take tea&mdash;or&mdash;which I considered
much more probable, some other refreshment.</p>

<p>I went to the house where I had seen Daly,
but he was gone&mdash;I questioned the woman of
the house strictly, but she assured me he had
taken his departure for the ship; adding, that
as she had seen me with him that afternoon, she

<!-- vol 3 page 333 -->

would not say so if it were not true&mdash;thus
affording me a proof that she was a party to
the necessity of his concealment from strangers.
However, I had done for the best, and since
going had been his object, I rejoiced that he
was gone.</p>

<p>It had now set in to rain, and I began to
doubt what I should do&mdash;however, during my
cogitation, the rain fell so much faster that I
was glad to return to the inn, where I intended
to remain until the weather cleared before I
ferried back, and accordingly re-entered the
house, and ran up stairs to the room, which I considered 
my own domain, when lo! and behold,
I found installed in <i>my</i> armed chair, by the side
of the fire, which <i>I</i> had ordered to be kept up, a
strange gentleman, coolly and quietly reading
the newspaper, by the light of <i>my</i> candles&mdash;I
thought everything in that apartment was, at
least for the time, mine.</p>

<p>When I opened the door he looked up&mdash;and
I drew back&mdash;on the point of flying into a desperate 
passion with the servants, for permitting

<!-- vol 3 page 334 -->

such an intrusion upon the sanctity of my territory; 
but I was instantly discovered by the
gentleman himself, who, rising with some difficulty 
from his chair, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg you a thousand pardons, Sir&mdash;I am
an intruder here, but I trust you will forgive
me&mdash;I am a sad invalid&mdash;I have just landed
from a ship at Spithead&mdash;I felt very chilly and
unwell; and this being the only room with a fire
in it, the landlady ventured to show me into
it&mdash;it is my fault, Sir&mdash;I hope you will excuse
me&mdash;I am going on immediately to Southampton 
on my way to Bath, and will not intrude
upon your kindness for any length of time."</p>

<p>This gentlemanly explanation, delivered in
a tone of particular sweetness, and with a
gentleness of manner unusually prepossessing,
extinguished all my youthful ire; and I replied,
that I hoped he would remain as long as was
agreeable to himself, and that I only rejoiced
in having thought of having a fire, which he
found so agreeable.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," said the stranger, "I have been

<!-- vol 3 page 335 -->

now four months on board ship&mdash;and the calm
and quiet of this room, and the ease of this
chair, are to me something I can scarcely describe 
to you&mdash;I have suffered much&mdash;and I
thought I should be frozen, for I am chilled
and wet through."</p>

<p>"Not a word, Sir," said I&mdash;"Had you not
better take something warm?" for I saw he
looked wretchedly ill.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," replied the stranger, "what you
take to be bodily illness in me, is in a great
degree to be attributed to mental ills. And,"
said he, a faint smile playing over his melancholy 
countenance, "it is hard</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">'To minister to a mind diseased.'</p>

</div>

<p>"I have suffered seriously, Sir,&mdash;I have lost a
fond and affectionate wife on the passage home&mdash;and 
if anything can aggravate such a misfortune,
it is perhaps the circumstances under which
my deprivation occurred&mdash;where the absence of
even the most indifferent individual is so marked&mdash;where 
the vacant place which that individual

<!-- vol 3 page 336 -->

filled, daily and hourly recalls the calamity to
mind&mdash;and where the loss of a beloved partner
and friend is by every common-place event kept
fixed in the mind and memory. It has been
a great trial to me, Sir, as you may think,
indeed, by my speaking of my sorrows to a
stranger."</p>

<p>"To nobody, Sir," said I, "could you speak
whose mind is more prepared to sympathize with
you than mine."</p>

<p>"Ah! Sir," continued the stranger, "I return 
to my country with blighted hopes and
a shattered constitution; I am now on a pilgrimage 
to the poor dear children, who, separated 
from their mother when almost infants,
will scarcely know how to appreciate their loss&mdash;it 
is to see them, to bless them, and to tell
them my sad story, that I have landed here
instead of at Portsmouth, in order to proceed
towards Bath, in the neighbourhood of which
place they are living; and I propose only to
wait until my servant brings on shore such
luggage as I may want for the journey. However, 

<!-- vol 3 page 337 -->

Sir, I ask your pardon for pressing my
affairs upon you: I felt some apology was necessary 
for my intrusion. I have been casting
my eye over the newspaper: you have no idea
how strange, to a man who can have heard no
intelligence from Europe for nine or ten months,
the events of the day he arrives appear&mdash;those
of whom we last heard in violent opposition to
the government, are here recorded as constant
attendants at court&mdash;and where honours descend,
the occupation of the sons of judges, and of
generals, and of admirals, who have succeeded,
and bear the same titles, are vastly whimsical."</p>

<p>I saw that my strange friend, who had prepossessed 
me in his favour very much, was
anxious to appear in better spirits than he really
was; and, as I thought it better for him to encourage 
this disposition, I determined, if I could,
to pick out a little information, as to whence he
came, and, in fact, what he was.</p>

<p>"I see," continued he, "but little alteration
in this place, or, as far as external appearance
goes, in Portsmouth. Walled towns are necessarily 

<!-- vol 3 page 338 -->

restrained from enlargement; and, although
alterations in detail may take place in the streets,
the limits are set&mdash;the boundaries marked&mdash;so
that, to the eye, from the sea, one cannot expect
much change."</p>

<p>From this time the gentleman conversed freely
upon general topics&mdash;he seemed unwilling to
speak of his own affairs; and whenever anything
occurred which led that way, he appeared to me
to avoid any farther observation with a kind of
shudder at the recollection of his domestic misfortunes.</p>

<p>I inquired whether my having something
"warm" would be disagreeable to him; on the
contrary, at my suggestion, he agreed to have a
glass of hot negus&mdash;an act which looked sociable,
but one, however, which he did not perform
without expressing much anxiety about his servant 
and his luggage, and an apprehension that
he should not get to Southampton until very
late.</p>

<p>As for my being on the eve of embarkation
for India, he had not the slightest idea of it.

<!-- vol 3 page 339 -->

The people at the inn of course considered me
only a casual visitor at Gosport; indeed, when
they brought me my glass of punch, and my new
friend his glass of negus, the waiter inquired
whether I slept there, to which I replied, that
I slept at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>I was glad to perceive, that the stranger
appeared much refreshed by his beverage; and
I ventured to suggest to him, as it was now past
nine o'clock, and his luggage not yet arrived, that
he had better remain at Gosport until the morning. 
This he objected to, but faintly, I thought,
and inquired at what time I proposed to cross
the water. I told him&mdash;punch is a wonderful 
opener of hearts&mdash;the fact, that I was to
embark the next day for Calcutta, and that I
was staying at Gosport, purposely to avoid the
gaiety of a reunion of the passengers of the
Ramchoondra.</p>

<p>"Is that your ship?" said the stranger; "I
know her well&mdash;a very fine ship she is&mdash;and her
captain a very excellent fellow. Are you going
out as a civilian, Sir, or in the army?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 340 -->

<p>"Neither, Sir," said I; "I am going out to
join a merchant's house in Calcutta."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said my companion; "and may
I ask&mdash;" what he would have asked, I know
not, for at that moment the waiter entered the
room, and, in a stentorian voice, said, "Gentlemen, 
is either of your names Gurney?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, jumping up, "mine is;"
convinced it was an application from poor
Daly.</p>

<p>"All your things is come ashore from the
ship, Sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>"My things come ashore!" exclaimed I, and
turned to my companion, who astounded me, by
saying&mdash;"There is some mistake, Sir, in this;
<i>my</i> name is Gurney&mdash;they are my things, and I
am very glad they <i>are</i> come."</p>

<p>"But, Sir," said I, "<i>my</i> name is Gurney too&mdash;you 
are coming home, I am going out&mdash;you
want your things on shore, but I want mine on
board."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> name Gurney?" said my companion,
rising from his seat.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 341 -->

<p>"Yes," said I, and the blessed truth flashed
upon my mind.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gilbert!</span>" exclaimed my companion.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cuthbert!</span>" cried I; and the next moment
we were in each other's arms.</p>

<p>An attempt to describe my feelings at this
moment would be useless. The whole thing
appeared like a dream&mdash;like an event impossible&mdash;or, 
rather, like one of those <i>coups de Theatre</i>,
well calculated to make an effect upon an audience, 
but which never occur in real life.
The effect it did produce upon one solitary
spectator, the waiter, was certainly "prodigious."
As to myself, the certainty of the fact, which,
while my brother held me to his heart, could
not be doubted, coupled with the extraordinary
chain of circumstances by which the meeting had
been brought about, perfectly bewildered me. If
I had been desirous of cultivating an acquaintance 
with my fellow-passengers,&mdash;if I had not
been desirous of visiting the scene of former
pleasures,&mdash;in short, if I had returned from the
ship and dined at Portsmouth, Cuthbert would

<!-- vol 3 page 342 -->

have been next day on his way to Bath, and I on
mine to Bengal. What worked this happy change
in my affairs?&mdash;the influence of my beloved
Harriet. Sanctified to my recollections of that
amiable girl, I could not permit the last day
of my residence in the same land with her, to
be profaned by idle revelry, or the commencement 
of new associations;&mdash;to her, and to solitude, 
I intended to devote the day,&mdash;and how
was I repaid!</p>

<p>In one moment, all my plans and purposes
were changed. Cuthbert, as he had already
told me, was a widower; he became so six
weeks after his marriage. It seems, that his
lady had been forewarned, some years before the
death of her former husband, of the danger to
which she exposed herself by remaining in India.
She persisted, and when she accepted Cuthbert
as her second husband, her determination was,
of course, to remain where she was. The medical 
men declared to Cuthbert the absolute necessity 
of her return to Europe; and this once
being established, he resolved, <i>co&ucirc;te qui co&ucirc;te</i>, to

<!-- vol 3 page 343 -->

accompany her. The removal, as far as she was
concerned, was too long procrastinated, and she
died on the passage, between the Cape and St.
Helena.</p>

<p>These were the facts. The feelings which
they produced were, as I have already said,
indescribable. The whole course of operation 
was changed. I intreated Cuthbert to
remain where he was for the night; I proposed
crossing immediately to Portsmouth, imparting
the events of the evening to the captain, and
then returning to my long lost brother; but
Cuthbert, who, after the first burst of affection
and surprise was over, felt very much exhausted,
begged me not to think of coming back;&mdash;he
would retire to rest, in a comfortable four-posted
"standing bed-place," at the India Arms, and
endeavour to tranquillize himself for the exertion
of the morrow;&mdash;that he would join me at Portsmouth 
in the morning, and that, instead of
going, in the first instance, to the orphans, near
Bath, we should together go to Nubley's, where,
as I had, in the shortest possible space of time,

<!-- vol 3 page 344 -->

informed him of every circumstance connected
with my attachment and engagement to Harriet,
we should remain, until we assembled together
all parties interested,&mdash;"At which period," said
Cuthbert, "you, my dear Gilbert, shall feel that
I can behave as a brother. I gave you up
in India in despair&mdash;the business is now disposed 
of&mdash;but rely upon it you shall lose nothing
by not having taken the voyage."</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined, that I remained
with my newly restored nearest relation as long
as I could; but I found that he required repose,
and, accordingly, having satisfied him upon as
many points as possible, I quitted him, nearly
wild with joy, and bounded down the streets of
Gosport towards the landing-place, stamping my
feet upon the pavement, and thinking as loudly
as ever did Nubley himself&mdash;Is it to be wondered 
at?&mdash;could I help it?&mdash;I wonder I did
not go mad.</p>

<p>When I had embarked the ferry-boat seemed
to linger,&mdash;the man pulled, but not half so well
as usual. I leant forward, and pushed forward.

<!-- vol 3 page 345 -->

as if I fancied the ardour of impatient anxiety
would propel the little bark. At last, we reached
the Hard, and away I scampered, rather than ran,
through the well-known gates, into High Street,
and, in less than ten minutes, found myself at
the George. The Ramchoondra party had
just finished their tea, and the captain was going
on board. Poor devils! thought I,&mdash;what pitching 
and bobbing out to Spithead in this dark
night, after a merry day's dinner on shore.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Gurney," said the captain, as I
came up to him, "I expected you to dine with
me; all my passengers, except yourself and one
other, have done me that pleasure. All that
sail in the same boat ought to know each other
ashore."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, holding my breath, and endeavouring 
to show the greatest composure,&mdash;"but&mdash;but&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am 
not going to sail in the same
boat with them."</p>

<p>"What, Sir!" exclaimed the captain,&mdash;"all
your things are on board. I'm off to-morrow
at noon&mdash;orders just come."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 346 -->

<p>"So is my brother Cuthbert," said I, "and I
have no need of making the voyage, whatever
forfeit is to be paid."</p>

<p>"Forfeit!" said the free-hearted skipper;
"there shall be no forfeit. If Mr. Cuthbert
Gurney is arrived, I shall be too happy to see
him before I start; and, as I do not think
you ever much relished the trip, Mr. Gilbert,
however sorry I am to lose your company, I am
heartily glad you are reprieved."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I, "and assure yourself,
if anything could have moderated the evil which
I considered the voyage to be, it would have
been sailing with you."</p>

<p>"Well, but," said the captain, "what shall
we do about your kit?"</p>

<p>This bit of solicitude, not being a dancing-master, 
I did not quite comprehend. He saw I
did not.</p>

<p>"Your traps, I mean?" said he.</p>

<p>This, not being in the rat-taking line, I was
equally at a loss to understand.</p>

<p>"Your sea stock, and chests, and all that?"

<!-- vol 3 page 347 -->

continued my excellent friend, "they must be
returned&mdash;you won't want them&mdash;the slop-sellers
will take them back at a trifling loss."</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "never mind."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Mr. Gurney," said the captain,
"but we must mind,&mdash;the man who keeps on
never minding, however well that may be when
grief is in the question, will never do business,&mdash;they 
must be re-landed; it shall be done the
first thing in the morning; there is a lighter
coming off with my last live stock and vegetables,
which shall bring them on shore for you, and I'll
take care all shall be right. I am deuced sorry to
lose you, and if I <i>can</i> possibly manage it, I will
make a point of seeing your most worthy brother
to-morrow, to whom present my best regards.
And so, Sir&mdash;give me your hand&mdash;and good night;
and all I can say is,&mdash;I say it from the bottom of
my heart,&mdash;I wish you all health and happiness
ashore, without the trouble of risking the one in
search of the other."</p>

<p>So departed my captain&mdash;and what did I
do?&mdash;I really do not recollect&mdash;I was too happy

<!-- vol 3 page 348 -->

to enjoy my happiness, and too anxious for
its full development, to endure the process of
waiting till two or three o'clock the next day,
when the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> should arrive. I went to
bed, but I slept not; I heard the various passengers 
of the H. C. S. Ramchoondra paddling
to their bed-rooms, the last night they were to
sleep on shore; and I thought to myself thought
I, "this time to-morrow, when you are wobbling
and squabbling in your floating seminary, I shall
be domesticated with the long lost brother of my
heart, and, perhaps, with the affianced wife of
my bosom."</p>

<p>As soon as it was light I was up: there I saw
trucks, and barrows, and bonnet-boxes, and
band-boxes, and hairy trunks, and red leather
trunks, and deal chests, containing all the trifling
extras, which the ladies of the Ramchoondra
party had recollected after everything in the
world had been packed up. And there were the
third mate, and the second mate, and the ladies
themselves, all going down High Street; and
then I saw three huge barrow-loads of my

<!-- vol 3 page 349 -->

things coming up High Street, all brought
ashore "per lighter," and presently found them
piled up in the hall of the inn, with a note from
the captain, saying that he did not think he
could leave his ship again,&mdash;that the Commodore
had been "blazing away," and "sporting his
bunting," at a deuce of a rate,&mdash;all of which
was Hebrew to me then,&mdash;reiterating his good
wishes for my welfare, and enclosing me the
first of a set of bills I had drawn upon Cuthbert
for my passage-money, with an order to the
agent in Broad Street to give me up "second
and third same tenor and date, unpaid."</p>

<p>Sudden joy, like sudden sorrow, seems, at
first, like a dream; and as I looked at all these
matters and proceedings, I almost feared that
what had so recently and rapidly occurred was
a vision; but when I saw my excellent brother
himself walking up High Street, he also followed
by barrow-loads of bags and baskets, and small
trunks, and large trunks, and all sorts of odd-shaped 
cases, containing every variety of oriental
luxury and comfort; I began to feel convinced of

<!-- vol 3 page 350 -->

the reality of my adventure: I hurried to meet
him&mdash;offered him my arm&mdash;and felt what it
was to feel the pressure of the hand of the only
living being upon earth who, by the ties of blood,
could care for me.</p>

<p>This was, perhaps, the happiest moment of my
life&mdash;of what frail tenure happiness is!&mdash;I was
delighted to find Cuthbert apparently so much
better in health, than he seemed to be the preceding 
evening, and, although he had taken
some early breakfast at Gosport, he joined me
in a later <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> at the George: he had, of
course, no object in staying at Portsmouth: I
merely was trying to know what could be done
with my "Kit," or my "Traps," or whatever the
phrases were, and which I imagined might be
transported to London by the waggon; but,
with regard to Cuthbert's "things," which
seemed to me nearly to equal the whole of my
stock for the voyage, I was considerably puzzled,
when I found that all the oil-skin covered baskets,
and high boxes, and low boxes, and brown bags,
and white bags, which were attended by two or

<!-- vol 3 page 351 -->

three native servants, contained nothing in the
world but what he wanted every day of his
life.</p>

<p>The servant who appeared to be absolutely
essential to his existence, looked to me like two
yards of white muslin rolled up, with a yellow
top&mdash;he called him Rumagee,&mdash;then there was
a fellow whom he called Buxoo, and two other
miserable pieces of trash and tiffany, who filled
the offices of Dobie and Dirgie; all of whom he
really thought he could not do without. I did
not like to presume upon so early a restoration
to his acquaintance, but I ventured to suggest
that one good English servant would do more,
and do it better, in England, than all these frail
pieces of rice-eating humanity; and that as the
Ramchoondra was still at anchor, and I had
heard the Captain most anxiously inquiring of
the landlord if he knew of any native servants
wanting to return, I suggested the dismissal,
at one <i>coup</i>, of these poor helpless wretches,
who, in this country, are only useful in making

<!-- vol 3 page 352 -->

fun for the little boys in the streets through
which they happen to pass.</p>

<p>Having, by a parity of reasoning, persuaded
my excellent brother to compress his luggage
into one or two English trunks, discarding all
the loose basket-work of the East, I, at about
twelve o'clock&mdash;(I found him entirely imbued
with the proverbial indolence of long residence
in India)&mdash;got him into a comfortable travelling
chaise,&mdash;not, indeed, quite so splendid as that in
which, under other circumstances, I had left the
Crown some years before,&mdash;and was waiting at
the door to put the finishing-stroke to our departure, 
when who should I see rolling up to me as
fast as he could, but my most excellent friend
Tom Hull. I started with surprise! but I was
delighted to see him; especially as I was certain
I could tell him something he could not "happen
to know."</p>

<p>"My dear Gurney," said Hull, "I am glad
to see you looking so well and so happy. Well&mdash;I 
have been there&mdash;come from the Isle

<!-- vol 3 page 353 -->

of Wight&mdash;sea mountains high&mdash;give you my
word never beheld such a scene in my life&mdash;never 
mind&mdash;saw the Ramchoondra yesterday 
afternoon&mdash;went on board&mdash;extremely civil
people&mdash;showed me your cabin&mdash;splendid apartment!&mdash;eh? 
you dog."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said I; "my dear fellow&mdash;what,
fifteen feet six, by six feet eleven!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hull, in a sort of grunt; "I
don't mean as to size&mdash;but comfort&mdash;eh!&mdash;saw
your stock&mdash;thousands of shirts&mdash;never saw
anything like it&mdash;eh!&mdash;Favell and Bousfield&mdash;known 
'em this thirty years&mdash;capital mat on the
floor&mdash;eh!&mdash;chest of drawers&mdash;pooh, pooh!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "but I am not going, my
fine fellow."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! don't tell me!" said Hull;
"you <i>are</i> going&mdash;why all that preparation&mdash;eh?&mdash;you 
can't do better&mdash;'the ball at your
foot'&mdash;eh! none of your nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "but nevertheless look!&mdash;here
are all the things you saw in my cabin yesterday&mdash;all 

<!-- vol 3 page 354 -->

re-landed and standing in the hall&mdash;what 
do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"That!" said Hull; "what I always said&mdash;I
said you <i>never</i> would go&mdash;knew it&mdash;told Daly so&mdash;won't 
suit him&mdash;don't care for money&mdash;what's
money to you&mdash;glad of it, eh!&mdash;but I must not stop&mdash;hear 
the horn&mdash;got a place on the box&mdash;here
comes the coach&mdash;you know the coachman!"</p>

<p>"Not I!" said I.</p>

<p>"You do!" said Hull; "met him at my
house at Mitcham&mdash;Tom Burr&mdash;excellent fellow&mdash;smashed&mdash;obliged 
to take to that&mdash;don't you
remember Mrs. B.&mdash;you and Daly and Tim&mdash;eh, 
you dog? pooh, pooh!&mdash;don't tell me!&mdash;<i>I</i>
happen to know&mdash;always go by him, Sir&mdash;good
bye&mdash;God bless you&mdash;delighted to know you
are not going.&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so away hurried my worthy friend, and
tumbling up on to the coach-box, whirr went
the horn, and away went the coach.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul," said Cuthbert, "what
spirits he has, and how well he looks!"</p>

<p>"Who?" said I.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 355 -->

<p>"Little Hull," said my brother.</p>

<p>"What!" said I, "do <i>you</i> happen to know
Hull?"</p>

<p>"Know him?" said Cuthbert; "I have not
seen him now for eight and thirty years, but
he isn't in the slightest degree altered during
that period&mdash;not in the least."</p>

<p>"How strange that you should recollect him,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Recollect him!" replied my brother; "not
at all strange. Why, he was the man who set up
our father's schoolmaster in business, out of pure
regard to his parents, with whom he was personally 
acquainted."</p>

<p>Hull, thought I, is not only omniscient, but
eternal;&mdash;but I could think no more of him, or
any thing else disconnected from self. Packed
up at length in our little travelling carriage; all
the Indians dismissed, save one, who at my suggestion 
covered his native trumpery with a shaggy
great-coat, which I had bought the day before,
previous to my embarkation from Gosport, away
we rattled for Chittagong Lodge. Every moment 

<!-- vol 3 page 356 -->

I was with Cuthbert convinced me more
and more of the excellence of his heart and the
warmth of his fraternal feelings. I lost no time
in vindicating myself from Mrs. Pillman's calumnies, 
and exerted myself to the utmost in
prepossessing him with the charms and attractions 
of Miss Wells; and even went the length
(which to a brother, under the circumstances,
was no breach of confidence) of showing him the
dear, kind, and generous letter which she had written 
to me. He appeared duly to appreciate her
merits; and having avowed himself anxious that
I should speedily "marry and settle," so as to
afford him a "family home,"&mdash;these were his own
words&mdash;I had little doubt that when he saw the
dear girl he would be too happy to sanction, in
the most unqualified manner, my union with the
only being I now felt could make me happy.</p>

<p>I will not occupy my pages with the account
of our arrival at Chittagong Lodge, nor by a
description of the warmth with which we were
received by our excellent host and his fair lady.
Neither will I throw a damp over the joy which

<!-- vol 3 page 357 -->

I believe we all felt at my brother's arrival, by
any further allusion to the melancholy event
which brought him to England alone. It was
quite evident, by Mr. Nubley's drone and Mrs.
Nubley's occasional titterings, that others beside
ourselves were deeply interested in my return
to the village; and I mightily rejoiced when I
was sitting, as composedly as I could sit, talking
congenial nonsense to the lady of the house, who
was employed netting, or knitting, or knotting&mdash;I 
do not know which&mdash;a new worsted comforter
for her better half, to hear Nubley, partly in conversation 
with Cuthbert, and partly in audible
cogitation, corroborate every thing I had said to
Harriet's advantage. The reason for this was
clear. Nubley always liked and admired Harriet; 
but while I was poor, and she had nothing,
he objected to the match. Now, it was quite
another matter; and when we parted for our
respective bed-rooms, I having first despatched
a letter to Mr. Wells, announcing what had
happened, and entreating him and his family to
return forthwith, I believe we were, bating my

<!-- vol 3 page 358 -->

poor brother's grief for the loss of his wife, as
happy a party as ever slept under the same roof.</p>

<p>Between ourselves, I began to suspect
that Cuthbert had discovered some of those
traits of character in the lady of his choice
to which Mrs. Nubley had before alluded;
because, although he certainly was labouring
under dreadful depression when I first so
fortunately encountered him at Gosport, his
spirits, since he had found consolation in the
affection and society of a brother, had wonderfully 
mended; and moreover he changed his
plan of proceeding post haste to visit the two
Miss Falwassers and Master Adolphus Falwasser, 
at their respective schools; and contented
himself by writing letters to the mistress of one
and the master of the other, informing them of
the never-to-be-sufficiently-lamented death of
their exemplary parent, and desiring that they
might be put into the deepest possible mourning; 
adding in a postscript that he would go to
them the very first moment he was able&mdash;his
appearance as their father-in-law being the

<!-- vol 3 page 359 -->

first intimation of the double event of the mother's 
second marriage and decease.</p>

<p>Oh! how I watched and waited during the
morning of the next day for the welcome sound
of Wells's voice&mdash;who, too happy in securing the
happiness of his child and myself, would come
rolling himself into the hall of Chittagong
Lodge, ready to seize me by both hands, and
congratulate me upon the happy and unexpected 
change in my affairs; but no&mdash;ten o'clock
came&mdash;no Wells&mdash;half-past ten&mdash;I could not
bear the suspense: I walked down to the parsonage; 
there was my poor, dear, kind old
woman;&mdash;she had heard that I was come back&mdash;heard 
of Cuthbert's arrival;&mdash;she shed tears when
she saw me.&mdash;I went into the drawing-room,
and slily hung up Harriet's picture in the place
whence I took it. I thought I should be called
simpleton by Wells, or Mrs. Wells, or perhaps
laughed at by that plump, little, bright-eyed thing,
Bessy, who was quite as wise in her generation
as she ought to be&mdash;and then, as there was no
news there, I walked back again. My suspense,

<!-- vol 3 page 360 -->

however, did not last long, for in about half
an hour a lout on horseback, who ought to have
been with us at least two hours before, brought
me a note from Mrs. Wells. These were its
contents:</p>

<p>"What has happened, God knows!&mdash;we have
lost Harriet&mdash;she is gone&mdash;whither we know
not&mdash;her father is in pursuit of her. Under any
other circumstances I should rejoice beyond
measure in the news your letter conveys&mdash;at all
events, I shall be at the Rectory this afternoon,
where Mr. Wells is either to send or come to
us. Harriet quitted this place, we suppose, in
the middle of the night before last. I send you
enclosed the note she left.</p>

<p class="right">"Yours, in the deepest distress,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">A. Wells.</span>"</p>

<br/>

<p>I was thunderstruck!&mdash;What did it mean&mdash;was 
I again deceived&mdash;was Harriet too, faithless?&mdash;no, 
no, that could not be. With a trembling 
hand I opened the note which was enclosed&mdash;and 
read what follows:</p>

<br/>

<!-- vol 3 page 361 -->

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Parents</span>,</p>

<p>I have struggled in vain&mdash;I have prayed in
vain&mdash;I have fallen, and have only to implore
your forgiveness&mdash;I have taught Gilbert to
believe I love him&mdash;you have permitted, sanctioned 
the attachment; nay, you have yourselves 
pledged us to each other&mdash;I cannot
permit him to go from me to encounter dangers
and difficulties, and shrink from them myself.
I am weak&mdash;I am bewildered; but if I am to
act towards him as he is acting towards others,
and do my duty&mdash;at least that which is implied
by our engagement, I ought to risk all. Assure
yourself, my beloved mother, that no harm will
befall me. A thousand, thousand thanks and
blessings for your kindness and affection. I
write incoherently&mdash;but I feel I must be the
partner of his voyage. For all the difficulties
and inconveniences I am prepared; I know
enough of woman's sympathy, to be assured,
that these will he soothed and assuaged, if once
they know my story in the ship in which we

<!-- vol 3 page 362 -->

shall sail. Oh! on my knees I implore your
pardon, best of fathers, dearest of mothers. If
<i>you</i> will forgive me, God will, for I am actuated
only by a sense of duty. Do not, do not follow
me. I take Frances with me; she will know
how to manage our little journey. Owing to
your kindness, I have money sufficient for all
expenses. Once more, farewell! and one more
prayer for forgiveness. If you should follow
me, I hope, before you can reach me, to be
on the wide, wide sea, that I once so much
dreaded. Kiss my dear sisters for me, and do
not blame me, at least to them.</p>

<p class="right">Ever, ever yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Harriet</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>This nearly drove me mad; but in the midst
of the excitement, may I honestly aver, it gave
me the sincerest pleasure. I knew she must be
safe: the year eighteen hundred and eleven was
not the age of romance; nor were the roads from
Lymington to Portsmouth infested with wolves
or robbers. And if anything could seal the

<!-- vol 3 page 363 -->

bond of union between us, it was the result of
the struggle of a pious, well-regulated mind,
with a passion founded upon friendship and
esteem, sanctioned by parental authority. Here
was no irregularity of feeling, no wildness of
thought, no wantonness of imagination: she felt
herself pledged&mdash;and she loved. From a miserable 
wretch, there never was so happy a dog
as I.</p>

<p>Differently, however, did circumstances turn
out. As soon as possible after Wells discovered 
the flight of his daughter, and long before
Mrs. Wells could write to me, he pursued her to
Portsmouth. He could hear no tidings of her,
as, indeed, it would have been strange if he
could; but he proceeded at once to the Point,
where he inquired if the ship Ramchoondra had
sailed. "Yes," was the answer; "she is gone.
Sir, with the rest on 'em, at last."</p>

<p>"Then," said Wells, "all is over; my girl is
lost to me."</p>

<p>"What, Sir," said another man, who was

<!-- vol 3 page 364 -->

standing by, "did you want to send anything
by her?"</p>

<p>"No," said Wells, "not I."</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "it's droll enough&mdash;that 
ship seems to have something queer about
her&mdash;do you recollect that young lady as was
down here before it was light asking after
her?"</p>

<p>"Young lady?" said Wells. "What do you
mean by a young lady?"</p>

<p>"Why, what do I mean?" replied the fellow,
who did not very much approve the sharp tone
of the question, "I mean a very nice young
lady, with another very pretty girl, which, as I
takes it, was her maid; and she comed down
and asked for the Ramchoondra."</p>

<p>"And did she reach it?" said Wells.</p>

<p>"Reach it!" said the man, "you might as
well have tried to scratch the moon's face with
a toasting-fork&mdash;Lord love ye; she was hull
down afore five o'clock.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know where that young
lady is?" said Wells.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 365 -->

<p>"I can't say as how I does," replied the
man.</p>

<p>"I think," said another, "as how she went
to the Postesses"&mdash;(subaudi Blue).</p>

<p>"Perhaps then she is still safe!" said Wells.</p>

<p>"Oh! no doubt of that, Sir," said the oldest
of the boatmen, "it's a wery respectable
house."</p>

<p>Conceive the state of the anxious father,
shivering with cold and anguish&mdash;his fair, delicate 
child, too tender to look at the moon with
me in a flower-garden well shaded with laurels,
to have been exposed to the pitiless pelting of a
night storm, and afterward driven to the shelter
of the Blue Posts at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>No matter&mdash;such was the truth. Frances,
the maid&mdash;the monitor&mdash;the companion of the
flight, and not improbably the furnisher of great
part of the means, had recommended repose to
her mistress. With her, who loved her, and had
lived with her from a child, she was secure: but
the agitation was great; and when later in the
morning her father, who had not disturbed the

<!-- vol 3 page 366 -->

rest which he found, by the description of her
person and companion, she was taking, at the
Inn in question, it increased tenfold.</p>

<p>Judge, then, what it was, when, restored to
the arms of her fond father, and returned to
her paternal roof, the truth was gradually imparted 
to her&mdash;that although the ship had
sailed, all that she treasured was yet on shore,
and near her&mdash;that everything was smooth and
settled&mdash;and that happiness, unclouded and unmitigated, 
awaited her. The effect was tremendous: 
the announcement, carefully and gradually 
made, burst upon her like a thunderbolt.
I ought not to write this, because I was the
cause and object; but, it is true. A revulsion
took place in her whole constitution; and that
delicacy of temperament which had irrevocably
decided her mother against her voyage to India
exhibited itself in a prostration the most tremendous 
and appalling.</p>

<p>My state of mind may easily be conceived.
There she was at the rectory, conscious of my
being close at hand, the medical men strictly

<!-- vol 3 page 367 -->

prohibiting an interview. She sank&mdash;and sank&mdash;and 
many were the days in which I stole to
the door of her room, and sat still upon the
stairs to catch the sound of her voice&mdash;even a
moan, or a sigh was music to my ears&mdash;until
my heart utterly failed me; the doctors gave
me no hope&mdash;and yet I could not despair: I
still watched and still prayed&mdash;and <span class="smcap">God</span> was
good&mdash;she recovered, and <span class="smcap">we were married</span>.</p>

<p>Having brought Mr. Gurney to the most important 
epoch of his life, the Editor terminates
his task, at least for the present; but, as Mr.
