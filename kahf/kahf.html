<h2>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</h2>

<p>THE First Edition of this Translation of Krilof contained
ninety-three Fables.  To the Third Edition fifty-five more were added.
As it now stands, the work contains all Krilof's original Fables, with
the exception of a few, the principal charm of which depends upon the
"curious felicity" of the fabulist's versification.  It is sometimes
better to leave verse alone than to turn it into prose.  Krilof's direct
imitations of &AElig;sop and La Fontaine have not yet been attempted,
their chief merit being one of form&horbar;a merit of which a prose
translation can give no idea.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p>THE poems of which a literal prose translation is now offered to the
English reader enjoy a popularity in their native land which they can
scarcely expect to obtain in a foreign country.  At home they live on
the lips and in the memories of old and young, of rich and poor, and
have become a sort of national heirloom; abroad they run the risk of
being regarded as little more than quaint curiosities.  Much of their
special excellence depends upon the choice felicity of their language
and the artistic structure of their verse; it is, therefore, scarcely
possible for any one to form a fair idea of their original merits who
makes their acquaintance only after they have been interpreted into
alien prose.  But, even in a foreign dress, I think that they cannot
fail to interest and to please such readers as will make fair allowance
for the disadvantages under which they labour.  Their brilliance has
naturally been dimmed, and their music has been altogether stilled; but
their shrewd insight into the thoughts and motives of the human heart,
their ingenious interpretation of the inarticulate sentiments which
prevail in the world of brutes, and their faculty of relating a story
clearly and concisely, all these remain; and all these can be
appreciated by the foreign reader.  The pictures of Russian life, also,
which their words offer are perfectly intelligible to all who take the
trouble to study them, and will convey to a stranger's mind a far more
correct idea of Russian manners and customs than he can gain from the
cleverest illustrations which fancy can suggest to an artist whose
knowledge of the subject is imperfect.  In the stories, for instance, of
"The Two Peasants," "The Peasant in Trouble," "The Three Moujiks," "The
Peasant and the Labourer," and several others of the same class, a store
of information will be found respecting the sayings and doings of the
common people of Russia, those many millions of fellow-Europeans of whom
we know much less than we do of the Chinese or the American Indians.
Still more interesting should be the protests which some of them offer
against the oppression and corruption which so long prevailed in Russia;
against the manner in which the strong trod down the weak, and the rich
ground the faces of the poor.  It is pleasant to mark the generous
sympathy with wronged weakness, the hardy indignation against guilty
strength, which prompted Krilof to pen such apologues as those of "The
Peasants and the River," "The Bear among the Bees," and "The Dancing
Fish."  Such stories as these can never be entirely divested of their
attraction, even when they have been stripped of their ornaments and
clothed in an unaccustomed and prosaic garb.</p>

<p>Most of the translators of these fables have tried to turn them into
verse.<sup><a href="#preface1_1">1</a></sup> I have not ventured to
attempt a similar task, but have confined my efforts to the production
of what I hope is a faithful prose rendering of Krilof's poetry.  The
version may be disfigured by the ungainliness of a photographic
portrait, but it aims at possessing something of a photograph's
fidelity.  The only liberty I have allowed myself with the fables I have
selected for translation has been sometimes to omit the "moral" when it
did not seem indispensable.  Krilof is never tedious as a moralist, but
all "morals" and "applications," and such-like tags and commentaries,
are apt to become tiresome.  I should not be surprised if the notes
which I have myself added bore witness to the truth of this
assertion.</p>

<p>I have translated about half of the entire collection of Krilof's
fables.  Of those I have omitted, a considerable part is composed of the
imitations with which Krilof commenced his career as a fabulist, and of
which I have thought it sufficient to give a couple of specimens.  The
rest are chiefly pieces which seem less original and characteristic than
those I have selected, or which appear comparatively pointless now,
though they had a special interest at the time they were written, and
for the readers for whom they were intended.  It should be borne in mind
that Krilof's fables were seldom mere literary bubbles, blown to create
an instant's amusement or admiration, but not intended to serve any
useful end, or to suggest any serious idea.  Each of them, as a general
rule, conveyed either a valuable warning or a wholesome reprimand.</p>

<p>Before bringing this preface to a close, I wish to acknowledge my
obligations to the several writers from whom I have borrowed.  For some
reason which I cannot clearly explain, English translators from the
Russian have shown a singular unwillingness to refer to the predecessors
who have made their task comparatively easy.  It has been a common
practice to make copious, if not exclusive, use of a French or German
translation of a Russian work, and then utterly to ignore the
obligation.  This course of behaviour appears to me injudicious, being
apt to expose those who follow it to unpleasant comments.  I think that,
in translating from so unfamiliar a language as the Russian, one should
by all means make use of such assistance as preceding translators have
to offer; but let that assistance be frankly acknowledged.</p>

<p>In my own case, although my translations have been made from the
original Russian, yet I have to express my thanks to M. Charles
Parfait<sup><a href="#preface1_2">2</a></sup> for his spirited
translation of the fables into French verse, and to M. Ferdinand
Torney<sup><a href="#preface1_3">3</a></sup> and an anonymous German
lady<sup><a href="#preface1_4">4</a></sup> for their versions into
German verse&horbar;versions which are singularly faithful, considering
the difficulties with which they have had to contend.  For the sketch of
Krilof's life I am almost entirely indebted to the memoirs written (in
Russian) by M. Pletnef, by M. Lobanof, and by M. Grot, of the Academy of
Sciences of St.  Petersburg.</p>

<p>I gladly seize this opportunity of expressing my thanks to M. Grot
for many kindnesses, and, among others, for his gift of the excellent
and thoroughly exhaustive critique by M. Kenevich,<sup><a
href="#preface1_5">5</a></sup> from which I have drawn most of the notes
which I have inserted (between brackets) at the end of some of the
fables.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have to thank another Russian friend, M. Alexander Onegine,
for the trouble he has taken in revising my translation, thereby
securing me against that dread of possible blunders innocently
committed, which so often hangs like a dreary shadow about a
translator's seldom overenviable path.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR.</h2>

<p>RATHER more than a hundred years ago,<sup><a
href="#memoir_1">1</a></sup> a boy was born at Moscow, on whom Fortune
seemed at first by no means disposed to smile, but who was destined to
enjoy in after-life a singular amount of honour and success.  His
father, a captain in the infantry of the line, found his income scarcely
sufficient for the support of even a small family, and had no reason for
hoping that the future would bring him better times.</p>

<p>Soon after the birth of the little Ivan Andre&euml;vich, the
captain's family followed his regiment into the east of Russia; and,
after a time, found themselves at Orenburg, in the midst of the troubles
caused by the insurrection of Pugachef, the insurgent leader, who
produced so great a disturbance by giving himself out to be the Emperor
Peter III.  That unfortunate monarch had in reality been assassinated
several years before; but a story had got abroad that he had managed to
escape from death, and was living somewhere in concealment; so the minds
of many men were prepared to accept Pugachef's daring statement.
Accordingly, the impostor soon raised a numerous army, and for some time
set the imperial troops at defiance.</p>

<p>During the period of his success, he attacked the fortress in which
the elder Krilof was stationed, and was so enraged at the obstinacy with
which it was defended, that he declared he would hang that officer and
all the members of his family.  They all ultimately contrived to escape;
but tradition states that they were often in great danger, and that on
one occasion, when they were halting in a village post-house, the little
Ivan was hidden out of harm's way in a large piece of earthenware which
stood in the cottage.</p>

<p>From Orenburg, they went to Tver; and there the captain, finding that
his expenses were becoming greater than his income, retired from the
army, and obtained a post in the civil service.  A few years later, he
died, leaving very little to his son, now a lad of fourteen, beyond a
large box of books, which had followed him in all his wanderings.</p>

<p>After a time, the boy obtained employment in the public service, but
of so unremunerative a nature that his mother determined to go with him
to St.  Petersburg, in hopes of obtaining a pension there as an
officer's widow.  All that she did obtain was a post for her son, with
the salary of two roubles (about six shillings) a month.<sup><a
href="#memoir_2">2</a></sup> He remained in the public service till the
year 1788, when he lost his mother.</p>

<p>She has been described as "a simple-minded woman, who had received
scarcely any education," but one of great worth and of considerable
strength of character.  She had done her best to obtain a good education
for her boy, reading Russian with him herself, and making him, when he
was studying French, read all his translations aloud to
her&horbar;although she did not understand a word of the language from
which they were rendered.  By means of little presents and rewards, she
induced him to study hard, and he soon took very kindly to books.  The
old volumes which had formed his father's travelling library he read
over and over again with delight, and, from the perusal of the histories
which were among diem, his mind became full of ideas about classic
Greece and ancient Russia.  Vague ideas concerning the stage next began
to float through his head, and, after a time, they shaped themselves
into a drama, called the "Cofeinitsa,"<sup><a
href="#memoir_3">3</a></sup> which he wrote (if the date of his birth
may be trusted) before he was sixteen years old.  This he offered to a
bookseller, who gave him sixty paper roubles for it (about as many
francs), or rather, at Krilof's express desire, books to that amount.
The works he chose were those of Racine, Boileau, and Moli&egrave;re,
preferring them to those of Voltaire and Cr&eacute;billon.  Years
afterwards, when he had become famous, the bookseller gave him back the
MS., which he had never published, and the poet re-read it with a
pleasure not altogether free from regret.</p>

<p>The lad next turned his attention to tragedy, and produced a piece
called "Cleopatra," which he showed to his friend, the celebrated actor,
Dmitrievsky.  The actor went carefully over it with him, and pointed out
so many faults that Krilof gave it up in despair, and began another,
under the title of "Philomela."  This also, which was finished in 1786,
and was printed nine years later in the collection of Russian dramas
published by the Academy of Sciences, failed to meet with the actor's
approval.  So the young author gave up the drama for a time.</p>

<p>After the death of his mother, which took place when he was twenty
years old, Krilof found himself entirely alone in the world, and free to
occupy himself as he pleased.  So he soon gave up his employment in the
public service, and determined to devote himself to literature.</p>

<p>In partnership with a retired officer of literary tastes, who had a
printing establishment of his own, he founded a journal, or rather a
monthly satirical magazine, called the "Spirit-Post;"<sup><a
href="#memoir_4">4</a></sup> but, cleverly as it was written, it was not
a commercial success, and, after a year, it stopped.  By this time,
Krilof had become the sole proprietor of the printing-press, which
occupied a room in the house which then stood where the Oldenburg Palace
stands now, close to the Summer Garden.  Then he began to print a new
journal, called the "Spectator,"<sup><a href="#memoir_5">5</a></sup>
which lasted eleven months.  Those were bad days for journalists in
Russia, and the circulation of the "Spectator" did not exceed 170
copies.<sup><a href="#memoir_6">6</a></sup> As soon as it had run its
brief course, Krilof started a third journal, under the title of the
"St.  Petersburg Mercury;" but, after a year's existence, this also came
to a close, never having secured more than 150 subscribers.  After its
demise, Krilof discontinued his own publications, but he continued to
print for others.</p>

<p>By this time, he had become well known in the world of letters, and,
as he was also a good musician and an agreeable companion, he was much
sought after in society.  Most of his biographers relate that he led a
jovial and careless life until 1801, when the Empress Maria Fedorovna
obtained a post for him at Riga, under Prince Sergius Galitsin.<sup><a
href="#memoir_7">7</a></sup> But M. Grot, of the Academy of Sciences,
points out that this is a mistake.  Krilof had, long before that time,
become intimate with the Prince, in whose house he lived for a while at
Moscow, and whom he accompanied first into Lithuania, and then to his
country house in the province of Saratof, in South-east Russia.  There
he remained till the year 1801.</p>

<p>This was an important period in his life, for it enabled him to study
the country well, and the ways of the country people.  When at Tver, in
his boyish days, he was always fond of associating with the common folk,
the "black people," as they are called in Russia&horbar;and he would
spend whole hours in wandering about the bazaars or the places where the
moujiks were amusing themselves, or in sitting on the banks of the
Volga, listening to the conversation of the washerwomen who congregated
there, and gossiped over their work.  While at Prince Galitsin's he had
again an opportunity of mixing among the peasantry, and of making
himself thoroughly acquainted with the joys and sorrows of village life.
There he could see for himself how hard was too often the peasant's lot,
how heavy was the pressure under which he had to groan.  It was there,
in all probability, that he stored up those impressions of the country
to which he afterwards so often gave form and colour in his fables.
There, too, he was able to study the curious scene presented by a rich
noble's country house; for Prince Galitsin lived in great state, keeping
up a band of forty musicians to play to him, and employing altogether as
many as six hundred retainers in his household.  The Prince and all his
family were very kind to the young poet, who used to teach the children
of the house, and get up little musical and theatrical entertainments
for the amusement of his hosts.  The only things he had to complain of
were the gnats and flies, which are certainly very trying in Russia, and
particularly in the neighbourhood of the Volga, and which he used to try
to avoid by mounting to the top of the village belfry, where he was one
day found, fast asleep among the bells.</p>

<p>When the Emperor Alexander I. mounted the throne, in 1801, he
recalled Prince Galitsin from his retirement in the country, and made
him military governor of Livonia.  Krilof went with him as a secretary,
but did not long act in that capacity; for it soon turned out that he
had no great talent for business, and, besides that, he began to devote
himself to gambling with what seemed likely to be a fatal passion.  But
he stayed with the Prince, as a friend and companion, till 1804, when
his patron gave up his appointment, and then he returned to St.
Petersburg.  According to the usual accounts, it was then that he went
to the Prince's estates in the province of Saratof; but it seems more
likely that he took to leading a wandering life at that time, and
continued it for some years, going from one Russian city to another, as
fancy led him.  He is said to have won a very large sum of money at
cards during his residence in Riga, so that he could well afford to be
idle and extravagant for a time.</p>

<p>What is certain is, that towards the end of the year 1805 he spent
some time in Moscow, and became intimate with the literary celebrities
of that capital.  To one of these, the celebrated poet and fabulist
Dmitrief, Krilof one day showed some fables which he had adapted from La
Fontaine.  Struck by their spirit and animation, Dmitrief inserted them
in the "Moscow Spectator," where they obtained a decided success, and
strongly recommended their author to cultivate this style of writing.
Krilof's fame may be said to date from that epoch.  He was nearly forty
years old before he found out in what his strength lay.</p>

<p>In 1806 he returned to St.  Petersburg, and soon afterwards obtained
a Government appointment, which he held for some years.  In 1807 he
produced two comedies, which obtained considerable success on the stage.
The one was called "The Fashions-Shop,"<sup><a
href="#memoir_8">8</a></sup> and the other "A Lesson for
Daughters,"<sup><a href="#memoir_9">9</a></sup> and both of them were
levelled against that taste for everything French, which was always so
excessively distasteful to Krilof.  With their appearance his dramatic
career came to a close, and thenceforward he was content to base his
reputation on his fables, of which the first collection, twenty-three in
number, was published in the year 1809; and the second, containing
twenty-one more, in 1811.  In 1812 he was appointed to a very congenial
post in the Imperial Public Library, which had just been reorganized and
placed under the direction of his intimate friend, Olenine.  The
officers to whom the various departments were entrusted were all men of
learning and literary tastes, and the section of Russian Literature was
confided to Sopikof, a very learned authority on Slavonic bibliography.
Krilof entered the Library as his assistant, and, six years later,
succeeded him in his post and in his official quarters.  That position
he continued to hold till the year 1841, when he definitively retired
from the public service.  Long before that time his fables had made him
the most popular writer in Russia.</p>

<p>The years he spent in the Public Library, almost thirty in number,
glided peacefully away.  He was a man of but few wants, and such as he
had he could easily satisfy.  Besides his salary, he had a pension of at
first about sixty pounds a year, and afterwards of twice that amount; so
he was sufficiently well off.  His position in the literary and
scientific world was a very pleasant one.  His fame as a popular author
was continually increasing, his presence was greatly prized and sought
after in society, and he was treated with almost affectionate kindness
by the imperial family.  He might, if he had liked, have revolved in the
most distinguished circles; but his tastes were very simple, and he had
little sympathy with gilded magnificence.  His quarters in the Public
Library suited him admirably, and so did his post, in which he had
little to disturb him.  The rooms which he had inherited from his
predecessor, Sopikof, were on the second floor of the building, their
windows looking out on the Gostinnoi-Dvor, the principal bazaar of St.
Petersburg&horbar;a huge collection of shops, the arcades surrounding
which are enlivened all day by the presence of crowds of loungers or
intending purchasers.  From his rooms Krilof could look down at his ease
on the busy scene below, and could listen contentedly to the
conversations which were constantly going on there between the merchants
and their customers, or among the peasants and the droshky-drivers, who
are accustomed to loiter in picturesque groups about the street which
divides the Library from the bazaar.  After his official labours were
over for the day, he used to go to the English Club, so called because
it was originally founded by an Englishman, and there he would dine
heartily, and then enjoy a doze.  For some time after his death, a
certain stain, due to the pressure of his head during the nap which was
his "usual custom of an afternoon," was carefully preserved upon the
walls of the club.  When his doze was over, he would sometimes go to the
theatre; but more frequently he stayed where he was, playing cards till
it was time to go home.  As he grew older and more unwieldy, he went out
more rarely into society; but there were a few houses which he always
loved to frequent, especially that of the Olenines, by whom he was
treated as if he had been a member of the family.  In the literary,
artistic, and scientific circles of St.  Petersburg it has always been
possible to enjoy the pleasures of society without encountering its
drawbacks.  The idea of giving parties "out of revenge" has never been
able to naturalize itself there; and men of narrow means have not
thought it necessary to hamper their mutual intercourse by restrictions
borrowed from the code of opulent festivity.  Consequently, Krilof was
able to spend a sociable evening with his friends, whenever the idea
occurred to him, without being compelled to submit to such changes of
dress as would have sorely vexed him.  For he was careless to a fault in
his costume.  At home, he generally wore an old and tattered
dressing-gown, and he had a strong objection to renewing his wardrobe.
When his old clothes were worn out, his friends used sometimes to get
him invested in new ones by dint of stratagem; but it was impossible to
instil into him the reverence with which such objects are generally
regarded by well-regulated minds.  Gloves he never would condescend to
wear, even in the depth of winter.  "I always lose them," he used to
plead, "and my hands never get cold."  And, indeed, his circulation was
singularly vigorous.  When he lived near the Summer Garden, he used to
bathe every day in the adjacent canal, and he continued this practice
even when the water was covered by a thin coat of ice.  So great was his
contempt for clothes that, in hot weather, he would sometimes dispense
with all but his shirt; and on one occasion, when, thus simply clad, he
was playing the violin, he was so carried away by the tide of musical
feeling, that he spent some time tranquilly performing at his open
window&horbar;quite unaware that he was presenting a singular spectacle
to the world of fashion then promenading in the Summer Garden.  He had
an eccentric habit of appropriating any stray napkin or towel, or the
like, that might be lying about a room, and of afterwards producing it
from his pocket, under the impression that it was his handkerchief, and
waving it before the eyes of the astonished company.  Perhaps the
strangest story told on good authority of his absence of mind in things
sartorial is that of his going to court on one occasion in a new
uniform.  His friend Olenine, just before entering the presence-chamber,
thought it as well to scrutinize Krilof's costume, and discovered that
he had got on so new a coat, that its buttons were still enveloped in
the silver paper which the tailor had carefully wrapped round them.</p>

<p>The state of his apartments was in keeping with that of his dress.
Neither order nor cleanliness had charms for his eyes.  Nothing was ever
cleaned or put to rights in his rooms:  his books lay about anywhere;
undisturbed dust accumulated upon everything.  He was very fond of
birds; and, twice a day, he used to strew his floor with oats, on which
the pigeons, which haunted the adjacent bazaar&horbar;sacred birds to
Russian eyes&horbar;would descend in flocks, finding easy access through
the open window.</p>

<p>During one brief period, the rooms wore a totally different
appearance; but the change did not last long.  Krilof had sold a new
edition of his fables for a large sum of money, and did not know what to
do with it.  At first, he thought of spending it in travelling abroad;
but he soon gave up that idea.  Then he determined to expend it upon the
embellishment of his apartments.  Upholsterers were called in; sumptuous
furniture was freely bought.  The floors were covered with costly
carpets; silken hangings adorned the walls and windows.  Choice pictures
were hung up on all sides, flanked by mirrors in gleaming frames; and,
wherever an inch of standing-room could be found, there was placed a
crystal vase, or a delicate statuette, or some fragile form of beauty in
glass.  The whole abode seemed transformed as by the wave of a fairy's
wand, and the owner might well be excused if he felt proud of the change
he had produced, when the newly decorated rooms were lighted up on the
occasion of the feast to which he invited his bosom friends in honour of
his apartments' metamorphosis.</p>

<p>But he soon grew tired of all this unwonted splendour.  A few days
after the inaugural banquet, one of his friends happened to call upon
him, and found that he had returned to his old ways.  The rich carpets
were strewn with oats, on which a greedy flock of pigeons was feeding.
Every time the door opened, away flew the birds in a hurry, upsetting
the crystals, overthrowing the statuettes, shivering the glass into
fragments.  A very short time sufficed to reduce the room to its normal
state of dirt and disorder, from which it never recovered as long as
Krilof occupied it.  Only, before the ruin took place, a sketch of this
sumptuous study was taken for the Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, which
still preserves the memory of the fabulist's short-lived
magnificence.</p>

<p>As may well be supposed, his servants were none of the best.  An old
woman, assisted by her daughter, waited upon him, and took care not to
trouble him by any excess of housewifely zeal.  Nothing was ever
cleaned; not a book was ever known to be dusted.  If a visitor arrived,
he did not know where to deposit his hat in safety, nor where to find a
seat from which he could rise unsoiled.  Krilof never troubled himself
about such superfluities as a writing-desk or a cabinet.  Even such
necessaries as pens and ink and paper were seldom to be discovered
without painful research.</p>

<p>One of his friends, in describing a visit which he paid the poet,
states that he found him smoking a cigar, which kept going out.  Each
time it went out, he called the servant-girl in to give him a light; so
at last she brought a candle without a candlestick, dropped a little
melted tallow on the table, and stuck the candle in it for her master's
convenience.  He was greatly addicted to tobacco, we may take this
opportunity of observing, and would often smoke, says Lobanof, "from
thirty-five to fifty cigars a day."  It is to be hoped that they were
cigarettes or papirosses.</p>

<p>It was dangerous, as might be imagined, to lend Krilof a book of any
value.  On one occasion, he was sitting at breakfast, reading a large
and valuable volume he had borrowed from his friend and patron, Olenine,
when suddenly he overbalanced himself, and, in trying to avoid a fall,
he upset the coffee-pot over the book.  Rushing wildly into the kitchen,
he carried off a bucket of water, and began to pour its contents over
the book as it lay on the ground.  Seeing this, his scared servant-maid
burst into the rooms of his colleague, Gnedich, and horrified him by the
news that her master had gone out of his mind.</p>

<p>This, by the way, was not the only occasion on which his eccentric
demeanour savoured of madness to vulgar understandings.  Once, it is
said, when he was very young, he was stopping in the country with Count
Tatischef, when his host was suddenly called away to town.  The Count,
whose whole family was to go with him, allowed Krilof, at his own
request, to remain where he was.  As soon as the young poet found
himself alone, he began to carry out an idea he had long cherished, and
to lead a life as similar as was possible to that led by man in
unsophisticated times.  With that view, he gave up devoting any time to
his toilette, discontinued shaving, and allowed his hair and nails to
grow as they liked.  Books, however, he did not discard; but, instead of
reading them at home, he spent the entire day over them in the garden.
One day, as he was strolling there, presenting a strange and hermit-like
appearance, the sound of wheels was suddenly heard, and, before he could
escape into the house, the Count and all his family, returning
unexpectedly, drove past the very spot where he was.  Their surprise may
be well conceived.  His confusion was probably as great then as it was
on the occasion of another misadventure which happened to him in early
youth.  When he was first at St.  Petersburg, he used to spend a good
deal of time at the house of his friend, the actor Dmitrievsky.  It
happened that at one time his visits were discontinued for a while, and
during that interval Dmitrievsky changed his quarters.  One day,
Dmitrievsky met his young friend, and invited him to dinner.  At the
appointed hour Krilof, who knew nothing about the change of address,
appeared at the wonted door.  It was opened by a servant, who told him
that her master was out.  "I'll come in and wait for him," said Krilof,
making his way into what had been his friend's bed-room, and there
unceremoniously going to sleep on the bed.  Now it happened that the
rooms were then occupied by a Chinovnik and his wife.  Presently they
returned home, and the lady went straight to her room without having
learned that a visitor had arrived during her absence.  Her astonishment
may be imagined when she discovered an utterly unknown young man
tranquilly slumbering on the bed.  The shriek which she naturally
uttered on seeing the sleeping stranger called her husband to her side,
and awoke the involuntary trespasser, who at first had some difficulty
in accounting for his totally unexpected appearance there.  It was
certainly an awkward position to retire from gracefully.</p>

<p>To his next-door neighbour, Gnedich, he was greatly attached,
heartily enjoying his society.  Gnedich had translated the "Iliad," and
was fond of holding forth on the subjects of Homer's merits and those of
Greek writers in general.  One day, Krilof, who was then fifty years
old, talked about learning Greek.  Gnedich told him he was too old, that
no one could learn a new language after such and such an age, and added
various other similar remarks of equal value.  Krilof made no reply;
but, the next day, he began to study Greek, making use of a New
Testament in which the original was accompanied by a Slavonic
translation, and being thus saved the trouble of consulting a
dictionary.  For two years he continued his studies in secret.  At the
end of that time, he happened to be present one day when Gnedich was
complaining that he could not understand a certain passage in Homer.  "I
should read it this way," said Krilof, favouring him with an impromptu
translation.  At first, Gnedich thought he was being cheated; but when
his companion had proved that he now knew Greek, translating several
passages taken from Homer at random, he did not know how to express his
wonder and admiration in sufficiently strong terms.  Afterwards, he
induced Krilof to commence a translation of the "Odyssey," but it never
went very far.  Krilof soon began to neglect his classical studies, and
the large collection of Greek works he had bought was shoved under his
bed.  Sometimes he would stretch out an arm in search of an &AElig;sop,
but all the others were forgotten; and, at last, his housekeeper, seeing
no use in such musty volumes, used them up, one after another, to heat
the stove.  A somewhat similar fate once befell a fable of his own.  He
had read it aloud at a party, and forgotten to take away the manuscript
with him.  The next day he sent for it, but learned that the servants,
having found a very shabby roll of paper, had used it to wrap up candles
in.</p>

<p>As he grew older and more corpulent, his natural laziness increased,
and it became difficult to induce him to exert himself.  He used to lie
in bed late, and, when he got up, he would invest himself in a
dressing-gown and a pair of slippers, and often sit in his rooms till
evening, dressed in little more than that simple garb.  When he was on
duty in the Library, and therefore confined within its walls for
twenty-four hours, he never grumbled at his lot, as Gnedich used to do,
but would lie on a sofa and read novels all day.  He read all sorts of
trash, merely to kill time, and sometimes thought so little about what
he was reading that, when he had got to the end of a story, he would
begin it over again without recognising it.  The only occurrence which
could rouse him to active exertion was that of a fire.  The moment he
heard of one, he would jump out of bed, and set off for the scene of the
disaster, willing to remain intently gazing at it as long as it lasted.
He seldom grew so excited in conversation about any other subject as he
was when he described the various great fires which he had seen,
especially that which took place on the north side of the Neva, when the
"camels" for the ships were destroyed.  Conflagrations are numerous and
extensive in Russia, and in winter, when everything is white with snow,
the effects produced by a large mass of flame at night are very fine,
and the more lasting inasmuch as it is difficult to obtain water in any
other shape than that of rock ice.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Krilof's stay in the Library, he was recommended
by the doctors to take more exercise; so, in fine weather, he used to go
for long walks, and when it rained he paced the galleries round the
upper floor of the Gostinnoi-Dvor.  At first, the shopkeepers used,
according to their wont, to pester him with invitations to purchase;
and, one day, the occupants of a certain stall made a rush at him, and
led him in triumph to their counter.  Feigning acquiescence, he turned
over all they showed him; but always demanded still more costly goods,
until he had made them fairly turn all their stock upside down.  Then,
with many thanks for the interesting exhibition they had offered him, he
made his escape.  A little farther on, the same scene was repeated.
Then the shopkeepers grew wiser:  those who had been victimized indulged
in that little laugh at their own expense, for which a Russian's sense
of humour makes him almost always ready; and the rest still more fully
appreciated the joke.</p>

<p>Some of Krilof's biographers have spoken as if his personal
appearance had been well known to all his fellow-citizens; but this is
evidently a mere figure of speech.  One of them tells a story of how the
fabulist was lunching off oysters one day&horbar;he was very fond of
them, and it is said that he could dispose of eight dozen, "washed down
with English porter"&horbar;when he discovered that he had left his
purse behind.  So he had to ask the proprietor of the establishment,
whom he did not know, to give him credit.  "Certainly, Ivan
Andre&euml;vich," answered the landlord.  "What, you know me, then?"
asked Krilof.  "Of course," was the flattering reply; "every one in the
city knows you, Ivan Andre&euml;vich."</p>

<p>So far, so well; but another narrator adds that, as Krilof was on his
way home, he stopped to buy some paper at a shop in the Gostinnoi-Dvor,
just opposite his own rooms.  When the parcel was handed to him, he said
to the shopkeeper, "I am Krilof; I live up there.  Please send up for
the money."  But the tradesman, with the unseemly materialism of his
class, merely remarked, "How can one know all the people in the world?
There's lots of them hereabouts;" and refused to part with the paper
until it was paid for.</p>

<p>But, in spite of this tradesman-like ignorance, it is certain that
Krilof was well known by sight as well as by reputation; and people used
to point him out to each other, and especially to their children, as he
walked along the streets.  His fables were eagerly sought after by the
editors of journals and magazines, and the collected editions of them
which he published from time to time met with a large and steadily
increasing sale.  Between the years 1830 and 1840, the publisher
Smirdine printed 40,000 copies of them in various forms, which found
their way into all parts of the empire, and made Krilof by far the most
popular author of the day.  There was scarcely a child belonging to the
educated classes who was not familiar with his stories; and they were
written in so simple a style, and in such idiomatic language, that they
were, for the most part, perfectly intelligible even to the totally
uneducated peasant.  His sketches of village life, for instance, and his
shrewd little illustrations of popular thought and feeling would be as
thoroughly appreciated by the rude inhabitants of a hamlet in the
interior, supposing that they had an opportunity of hearing them read or
recited, as by the literary men whom Krilof used to meet at Jukovsky's
pleasant Saturday-evening gatherings, or by his learned colleagues of
the Academy of Sciences or the "Society of the Lovers of Russian
Literature."</p>

<p>Nor was it merely in his own country that Krilof's name was known.
Various translators had given specimens of his writings to their
respective countrymen; and, in the year 1824, a sumptuous edition of his
fables was edited in Paris by Count Gregory Orlof.  A number of
distinguished French and Italian poets co-operated in this work,
rendering into their best verse the literal prose translations which
were laid before them.  Many a version which pretends to be "from the
Russian" has been really produced after a similar fashion, and the
result has generally been as disappointing as that of Count Orlofs
enterprise, "whose book," says M. Charles Parfait, "was one in which
Russia could not recognise a single characteristic of her national
poet."  Still it served to gain Krilof a reputation in France of which
many of his contemporaries would have been very proud.  He does not seem
to have cared much about it himself; and on one occasion, when the
proofs of a memoir of his life, which was about to be inserted in a
French biographical dictionary, were sent to him for correction, he at
first refused to trouble himself about them at all, saying, "Let them
write what they like," and ultimately consented only to make a few
slight alterations in them.  For he was singularly free from that eager
thirst after fame which so many really distinguished writers have felt.
He always spoke most modestly about what he had done.  "I am like a
sailor," he said, on one occasion, "who has not met with any disasters,
simply because he has never ventured far from shore."  His early works
he called the follies of his youth; and even of his fables, after they
had gained the general applause of the public, he was wont to say very
little.  Many of them alluded to persons and to events about which many
people must have been curious to know; but he scarcely ever told even
his most intimate friends what were the particular objects of his
satire; and, in most cases, the secret went with him into the grave.  Of
his manuscripts he was utterly careless.  Before a fable was printed, he
took the greatest pains with it, going, perhaps, as many as ten times
over it, and never ceasing to revise it as long as there was a word in
it he could improve or correct.  But, after the printers had finished
with his copy, he took no more interest in it.  Of the collection of his
manuscripts now in the Public Library at St.  Petersburg, a great part
consists of a number of rough drafts found by his friend Lobanof among
the litter of a garret.</p>

<p>In February, 1838, Krilof's seventieth birthday was celebrated by his
friends in a manner which could not fail to touch him deeply.  A grand
banquet was organized in the Nobles' Hall, at which three hundred of the
most distinguished members of the cultivated society of St.  Petersburg
assisted.  In front of his seat was placed his bust, crowned with
flowers; and, at the end of the feast, flowers were showered down upon
him by the ladies who occupied the galleries, and who were eager to do
honour to their own and their children's friend.  A laurel crown had
been presented to him, and, as he was going away, a number of the
students of the University crowded round him, asking for a leaf as a
relic.</p>

<p>From that time forward, he may almost be said to have written no
more.  About a couple of years after the festival, he resigned his
office, and moved from the Public Library to the other side of the
river.  There he lived for some time in the Vassily Ostrof, leading a
very retired life, and gradually dropping more and more out of society.
It was while he was there that a fire broke out, one night, next door.
Every one else was naturally much alarmed; but Krilof took everything so
quietly, that he would not even dress and go out until he had finished
his tea and a cigar, nor would he give any orders about saving his books
and memoranda.</p>

<p>After some time, he again changed his abode, and went to the
extremity of the city, where he fitted up some rooms, from the windows
of which a splendid view might be enjoyed.  There he proposed to lead a
still more retired life than before.  It would, perhaps, have been more
lonely than he would have liked; for he had outlived most of the friends
of his younger days, and he does not seem to have had a single relation
with whom he was acquainted.  At one period of his life, when he was
young and poor, and, comparatively speaking, unknown, he had formed a
strong attachment for a young girl, whom he hoped to be allowed to
marry.  But her parents objected to his poverty, and his hopes remained
unfulfilled.  Among his poems, are to be found a number of lyrics
addressed to Annette.  They form the only trace that is left of the
fruitless passion of his youth.  In his old age, he adopted the children
of his servant's daughter, Saveleva; but it is very likely that, in his
declining years, he missed those little attentions by which a loved hand
can do so much to make smooth the end of the journey of life.</p>

<p>His last illness was one of but short duration.  He retained the full
use of his faculties to the end; and his last words were, "Lord, forgive
me my trespasses!"  With them ended a life which was very dear to his
countrymen.  He died on November 9/21 1844, at the age of 76.</p>

<p>His funeral was celebrated at the public expense, and was attended by
such crowds that the great church of St.  Isaac could not hold those who
wished to assist at the service of the dead.  The whole of the Nevsky
Prospect was thronged by masses of sympathizing lookers-on, thousands of
whom followed the coffin, which, surrounded by the students of the
University, passed slowly up the long street, and under the windows of
the rooms in which Krilof had spent so many peaceful years, till it
reached the cemetery attached to the Convent of St.  Alexander Nevsky.
There the remains of Krilof were deposited, by the side of the tomb of
his friend Gnedich, and within sight of that of Karamzine.  Beside him
in the coffin his friends had placed the laurel crown which had been
conferred upon him at the time of his jubilee banquet, and, in
accordance with an urgent request which he expressed before his death, a
bouquet which had many years previously been presented to him by the
Empress Alexandra Fedorovna.  Soon afterwards a public subscription was
opened for the purpose of erecting a monument to his memory, and the
children of Russia, of all ages and classes, united in contributing to
it.  With its proceeds an excellent statue of the poet was set up in the
Summer Garden, within sight of the windows of the palace which now
occupies the place of the house in which his printing-press used to
work.  There he sits in bronze, just as he used to sit in the flesh,
clad in his well-loved dressing-gown, an open book in his hand.  The
pedestal of the monument is adorned with bronze figures representing the
various animals about which he wrote; and a couple of bas-reliefs
illustrate two of his most popular fables&horbar;"Demian's Fish Soup"
and "Fortune and the Beggar."  Around the monument, which stands in a
circular open space, a number of children are always at play, dressed in
the picturesque garb which juvenile Russia affects, and on them the poet
seems to smile benignly as he looks down from his easy chair above.  It
is a thoroughly national monument&horbar;somewhat rare object in Russia,
where previous statues have for the most part greatly puzzled the
natives, who call them <i>bolvani</i>&horbar;idols.  That of Lomonossof,
for instance, which stands at Archangel bareheaded and classically
undressed, is a subject of great wonder to the peasants, who find it of
a chilly and depressing appearance, as seen among the snows of an Arctic
winter.  But Krilof's statue is of an altogether different kind, having
the merits of being characteristic and intelligible.  It is a worthy
memorial to a man who had, to a singular degree, gained the affection of
his contemporaries, and who will probably retain that of their
descendants.  For many a score of years to come his memory is likely to
be kept green in the minds of the children and the children's children
of those little people who now play around his statue, in what is one of
the most picturesque spots of St.  Petersburg, when the sun is bright
and the sky is blue overhead, and the trees of the Summer Garden are
clothed in foliage that offers a pleasant shelter from the heat.  At
such a time it is very pleasant for any one who has read Krilof's
fables, and who is not unduly depressed by the thought that the tide of
aristocratic life has ebbed from the summer-smitten city, to sit in the
grateful shade, and, as he lazily watches the gleam of palace walls
through the openings in the hanging curtain of green leaves, to call up
before his mental vision the varied scenes which the poet has depicted,
and the quaint animal life with which he has peopled them.  If it be a
Russian who is thus indulging in day-dreams, the chances are that they
will be crossed by some shadow of regret for old days gone by, and
perhaps haunted by what seem to be echoes of a voice that is still.</p>

<h1>KRILOF AND HIS FABLES</h1>

<h2 id="f001">THE TWO PEASANTS.</h2>

<p>"GOOD day, gossip Thaddeus!"</p>

<p>"Good day, gossip Egor!"</p>

<p>"Well, friend, how are you getting on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, gossip, I see you don't know about my misfortune.  God has
afflicted me:  I have burnt myself out of house and home, and have been
obliged to go about begging ever since."</p>

<p>"How ever did you manage that?  That was a poor joke, my friend."</p>

<p>"Just so.  On Christmas Day we had a feast.  I went out to give the
horses their food, candle in hand.  I must confess there was a buzzing
in my head.  Well, I don't know how it was, but I must have let a spark
fall.  I just managed to save myself; but my homestead was burnt, and
all I had in it.  Now for your story."</p>

<p>"Ah, Thaddeus, a sad piece of work!  With me, also, it seems, God has
been angry.  You see, I have no feet left.  I think it's a perfect
miracle that I escaped with my life.  I went to the cellar for beer.  It
was Christmas Day in my case too, and I, too, must confess that I had
swallowed a little too much brandy along with my friends.  Well, that I
mightn't set the house on fire in my drunkenness, I blew the candle
right out.  But the devil gave me such a fall down-stairs in the dark,
that he made me a mere wreck of a man; and here I've been a cripple ever
since."</p>

<p>"Blame yourselves, friends," said their kinsman Stefan.  "To tell the
truth, I don't think it a miracle that one of you has burnt his house
down, and the other is on crutches.  Things go ill with a drunken man,
when he has a candle in his hand; but he is even worse off when he is in
the dark."</p>

<h2 id="f002">THE EDUCATION OF THE LION.</h2>

<p>TO the Lion, the king of the forests, Heaven gave a son.  You know
how different from ours is the nature of beasts.  Among us, a child a
year old, if it belong to a royal family, is small and weak and stupid.
But, by the time it has lived a twelvemonth, a lion-cub has long ago
left off its baby-linen.  So, at the end of a year, the Lion began
seriously to consider that he must not allow his son to remain ignorant,
not wishing that the royal dignity should be degraded in him, or that,
when the son's turn should come to govern the kingdom, the nation should
reproach the father on his account.  But whom should he entreat, or
compel, or induce by rewards to instruct the Czarevich how to become a
Czar?  Should he hand him over to the Fox?  The Fox is clever, but it is
terribly addicted to telling lies; and a liar is perpetually getting
into trouble.  "No," thought the Lion; "the science of falsehood is not
one which princes ought to study."  Should he trust him to the Mole?
Every one who speaks of that animal says that it is an extreme admirer
of regularity in everything, and that it never takes a step without
examining the ground before it, and that it cleans and shells with its
own paws every grain of com that comes to its table.  In fact, the Mole
has the reputation of being very great in small affairs.  Unfortunately,
however, though the Mole's eyes are keen for whatever is just under its
nose, it cannot see anything at a distance.  The Mole's love of order is
an excellent thing for animals of its own kind; but the Lion's kingdom
is considerably more extensive than a mole-run.  Should he choose the
Panther?  The Panther is brave and strong, and, besides that, it is a
great master of military tactics.  But the Panther knows nothing about
politics, and is absolutely ignorant of everything else that concerns
civil affairs.  Pretty lessons indeed it would give in ruling!  A king
must be a judge and a minister, as well as a warrior; but the Panther is
good for nothing but fighting, so it, too, is unfit to educate royal
children.  To be brief, not a single beast, not even the Elephant
himself, who was as much respected in the forest as Plato used to be in
Greece, seemed wise enough or sufficiently well informed to satisfy the
Lion.</p>

<p>By good fortune, or the opposite&horbar;we shall find out which
before long,&horbar;another king, the king of birds, the Eagle, an old
acquaintance and friend of the Lion, heard of that monarch's difficulty,
and, wishing to do his friend a great kindness, offered to educate the
young Lion himself.  The Lion felt as if a weight were taken off his
shoulders; and no wonder.  What could be better, as it seemed, than to
find a king as a prince's tutor?  So the Lion-cub was got ready, and
sent off to the Eagle's court, there to learn how to govern.</p>

<p>Two or three years go by; in the meantime, ask whom you will, you
hear nothing but unanimous praise of the young Lion, and all the birds
scatter through the forests wonderful stories about his merits.  At last
the appointed time comes, and the Lion sends for his son.  The prince
arrives, and the king gathers all his people together, summoning great
and small alike.  He embraces his son before them all, kisses him, and
addresses him in these words:  "My beloved son, you are my only heir.  I
am now looking forward to the grave; but you are only just entering upon
life, so I intend to make over my sceptre to you.  Only tell me first,
in the presence of this assembly, what you have been taught, how much
you know, and in what manner you propose to make your people happy."</p>

<p>"Papa," answered the prince, "I know what no one else here knows.  I
can tell where each bird, from the Eagle to the Quail, can most readily
find water, on what each of them lives, and how many eggs it lays; and I
can count up all the wants of every bird, without missing one.  Here is
the certificate my tutor gave me.  It was not for nothing that the birds
used to say that I could pick the stars out of the sky.  And when you
have made up your mind to transfer your power to me, I will immediately
begin to teach the beasts how to make nests."</p>

<p>On this the king and all his beasts howled aloud.  The members of the
council hung their heads, and the old Lion perceived, too late, that the
young Lion had not learned what was wanted&horbar;that he was acquainted
with birds only, not knowing the nature of beasts, although he was
destined by birth to rule over beasts, and that he was utterly ignorant
of the knowledge which is most requisite in kings&horbar;the knowledge
of what are the wants of their own people, and what are the interests of
their own country.</p>

<p>[This fable refers to the education of the Emperor Alexander I.
Catherine entrusted it to the Genevese La Harpe&horbar;a man of
excellent intentions, but one who knew very little about Russia, and who
set up his own little republic before the eyes of the future despot as
the type of the most perfect commonwealth in the world.  He filled the
boy's head with ideas which would certainly appear to Krilof to be
beyond a boy's comprehension; and when his pupil came to the throne, he
wrote him a pressing letter from Geneva, urging him to give Russia a
constitution, without waiting to make any preparations for its
reception.</p>

<p>One of Florian's fables bears the title of "The Lion's Education;"
and as it was translated by Dmitrief, it is very probable that Krilof
may have read it.  But there is very little resemblance between the two
fables.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f003">THE BROOK.</h2>

<p>A SHEPHERD by the side of a Brook complainingly sang, in his grief,
of his sad and irreparable loss.  His pet lamb had lately been drowned
in the neighbouring river.  Having heard the Shepherd, the Brook thus
began to murmur indignantly:</p>

<p>"Insatiable river! how would it be if thy depths, like mine, were
clearly visible to all eyes, and every one could see, in thy most secret
recesses, all the victims which thou hast so greedily swallowed up?  I
think that thou wouldst dive into the earth for shame, and hide thyself
in its dark abysses.  Methinks that, if Fate gave me such copious
waters, I should become an ornament to Nature, and would never hurt even
so much as a chicken.  How cautiously should my waves roll past every
bush, every cottage!  My shores would only bless me, and I should bring
fresh life to the adjacent valleys and meadows, without robbing them of
so much as even a single leaflet.  Then, in a word, I should perform my
journey in a kindly spirit, nowhere causing misfortune or sorrow, and my
waters should flow right down to the sea as pure as silver."</p>

<p>So spake the Brook, and so it really meant.  But what happened?  A
week had not gone by before a heavy raincloud burst upon a neighbouring
hill.  In its affluence of waters the Brook suddenly rivalled the river.
But, alas! what has become of the Brook's tranquillity?  The Brook
overflows its banks with turbid waters.  It seethes; it roars; it flings
about masses of soiled foam.  It overthrows ancestral oaks:  their
crashing may be heard afar.  And, at last, that very shepherd, on whose
account it lately upbraided the river with such a flow of eloquence,
perished in it with all his flock, and of his cottage not even a trace
was left behind.</p>

<p>How many brooks are there which flow along so smoothly, so
peacefully, and murmur so sweetly to the heart, only because they have
but very little water in them!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f004">THE MILLER.</h2>

<p>THE water began to dribble away through a Miller's dam.  At first
there would have been no great harm done, if he had taken the matter in
hand.  But why should he?  Our Miller does not think of troubling
himself.  The leak becomes worse every day, and the water pours out as
if from a tap.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Miller! don't stand gaping there!  It's time you should set
your wits to work."</p>

<p>But the Miller says,</p>

<p>"Harm's a long way off.  I don't require an ocean of water, and my
mill is rich enough in it for all my time."</p>

<p>He sleeps; but meantime the water goes on running in torrents.  And
see! harm is here now in full force.  The millstone stands still; the
mill will not work.  Our Miller bestirs himself, groans, troubles
himself, and thinks how he can keep the waters back.  While he is here
on the dam, examining the leak, he observes his fowls coming to drink at
the river.</p>

<p>"You stupid, good-for-nothing birds!" he cries.  "I don't know where
I'm to get water, even when you are out of the question; and here you
come and drink the little that remains."</p>

<p>So he begins pelting them with faggots.  What good did he do himself
by this?  Without a fowl left, or a drop of water, he went back
home.</p>

<p>I have sometimes remarked that there are many proprietors of this
kind&horbar;and this little fable was composed as a present for
them&horbar;who do not grudge thousands spent on follies, but who think
that they maintain domestic economy by collecting their candle-ends, and
are ready to quarrel with their servants about them.  With such economy,
is it strange that houses rapidly fall utterly to pieces?</p>

<p>[It is said that Krilof's own ideas of economy were, for the most
part, of the very kind he satirizes here.  "Returning from a party with
me one evening," says his friend Gniedich, "Krilof wouldn't pay what I
did for a good carriage, saying it was wasting money.  So he walked half
of the way home; but then he became tired, and eventually he was obliged
to get into a wretched vehicle, and pay almost as much, for half the
distance, as he had been asked at first.  And this was what he called
economy."]</p>

<h2 id="f005">THE GRANDEE.</h2>

<p>ONCE, in the days of old, a certain Grandee passed from his richly
dight bed into the realm which Pluto sways.  To speak more simply, he
died.  And so, as was anciently the custom, he appeared before the
justice-seat of Hades.  Straightway he was asked, "Where were you born?
What have you been?"</p>

<p>"I was born in Persia, and my rank was that of a Satrap.  But, as my
health was feeble during my lifetime, I never exercised any personal
control in my province, but left everything to be done by my
secretary."</p>

<p>"But you&horbar;what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I ate, drank, and slept; and I signed everything he set before
me."</p>

<p>"In with him, then, at once into Paradise!"</p>

<p>"How now!  Where is the justice of this?" thereupon exclaimed
Mercury, forgetting all politeness.</p>

<p>"Ah, brother," answered Eacus, "you know nothing about it.  But don't
you see this?  The dead man was a fool.  What would have happened if he,
who had such power in his hands, had unfortunately interfered in
business?  Why, he would have ruined the whole province.  The tears
which would have flowed then would have been beyond all calculation.
Therefore it is that he has gone into Paradise, because he did not
interfere with business."</p>

<p>I was in court yesterday, and I saw a judge there.  There can be no
doubt that he will go into Paradise.</p>

<p>[When this fable was submitted to the censors, they sent it on to the
Minister of Public Instruction, who kept it by him for a whole year,
instead of giving any decision about it.  Meanwhile, copies of it were
circulated in MS., and it became well known in society; but still the
minister withheld permission to print it.  At last, at one of the
court-masquerades, Krilof found an opportunity of reading it to the
Emperor Nicholas, who was so delighted with it that he took him in his
arms, kissed him, and said, "Write away, old man, write away."  On the
strength of this, Krilof applied anew to the authorities, and obtained
leave to print the fable.  With its appearance, his literary career may
be said to have come to a close.]</p>

<h2 id="f006">THE WOLF IN THE KENNEL.</h2>

<p>A WOLF, one night, thinking to climb into a sheepfold, fell into a
kennel.  Immediately the whole kennel was up in arms.  The dogs,
scenting the grisly disturber so near at hand, began to bark in their
quarters, and to tear out to the fight.</p>

<p>"Hallo, lads, a thief!" cried the keepers; and immediately the gates
were shut.  In a moment the kennel became a hell.  Men come running, one
armed with a club, another with a gun.  "Lights!" they cry; "bring
lights!"  The lights being brought, our Wolf is seen sitting squeezed up
in the furthest comer, gnashing its teeth, its hide bristling, and its
eyes looking as if it would fain eat up the whole party.  Seeing,
however, that it is not now in the presence of the flock, and that it is
now called upon to pay the penalty for the sheep it has killed, my
trickster resorts to negotiation, beginning thus:</p>

<p>"Friends, what is all this fuss about?  I am your ancient gossip and
comrade; and I have come here to contract an alliance with
you&horbar;not with the slightest intention of quarrelling.  Let us
forget the past, and declare in favour of mutual harmony.  Not only will
I for the future avoid touching the flocks belonging to this spot, but I
will gladly fight in their behalf against others; and I swear on the
word of a Wolf that I&horbar;&horbar;"</p>

<p>"Listen, neighbour," here interrupted the huntsman.  "You are
grey-coated; but I, friend, am grey-headed, and I have long known what
your wolfish natures are like, and therefore it is my custom never to
make peace with wolves until I have torn their skin from off their
backs."</p>

<p>With that he let go the pack of hounds on the Wolf.</p>

<p>[This fable, which was printed in October, 1812, represents Napoleon
in Russia.  The words put into the mouth of the Wolf are almost exactly
those of which he himself made use.  It is said that, after the battle
of Krasnoe, Kutuzof read this fable aloud to the officers who stood
round him, and that, when he came to the words, "You are grey-coated;
but I, friend, am grey-headed," in which an allusion is made to
Napoleon's grey overcoat and his own white hair, he took off his white
forage-cap, and shook his bent head.  Buistrof says that he once read to
Krilof a statement to the effect that, "after Borodino, Kutuzof's young
soldiers abused him for not instantly attacking Napoleon; but Krilof,
understanding his intentions, sent him this fable, which he read to his
younger officers, and so appeased them."  On hearing this, however,
Krilof frowned, and said, "That's all nonsense.  Is it likely that I, a
private individual, neither a diplomatist:  nor a soldier, should have
known beforehand what Kutuzof was going to do?  It's absurd!  Say, in
some paper or other, my friend, that it is not true."]</p>

<h2 id="f007">THE THREE MOUJIKS.</h2>

<p>THREE Moujiks<sup><a href="#f007_1">1</a></sup> stopped at a village
to pass the night.  They had done their business at Petersburg as
drivers; had sometimes worked, and sometimes amused themselves; and were
now going back to their native place.  As a Moujik does not like to go
to bed empty, our visitors asked for supper.  But villagers have no
variety of dishes.  They set on the table before the hungry travellers a
basin of cabbage soup, some bread, and the remains of a bowl of
porridge.  It wasn't like Petersburg fare, but there was no use in
talking about that; at all events, it was better than going to bed
hungry.  So the Moujiks crossed themselves, and sat down to table.  Then
the one who was the sharpest of them, seeing that there was altogether
but little for three, perceived how the business might be mended.  When
force can't win the day, a little cunning must be tried.</p>

<p>"Comrades," he cries, "you know Thomas; well, he's likely to have his
hair cropped<sup><a href="#f007_2">2</a></sup> during this levy."</p>

<p>"What levy?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's news of a war with China.  Our father<sup><a
href="#f007_3">3</a></sup> has ordered the Chinese to pay a tribute of
tea."</p>

<p>On that the two others took to weighing the matter, and deliberating
upon it (unfortunately they could read, and had studied newspapers and
reports), as to how the war would be carried on, and who should have the
command.  Our friends began a regular discussion, surmised, explained,
wrangled.  That was just what our trickster wanted.  While they were
giving their advice, and settling affairs, and arranging the forces, he
didn't say a word, but ate up the whole of the soup and the
porridge.</p>

<h2 id="f008">THE DIVISION.</h2>

<p>CERTAIN honest merchants, who had their dwelling and their
counting-house in common, made a heap of money.  Having wound up their
business, they wish to divide their gains.  But how can a division take
place without squabbling?  They have begun to quarrel about the money
and the stock, when suddenly there is a cry that the house is on
fire.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, save the goods and the house!" shouts one of them.
"Come along; we will settle our accounts afterwards!"</p>

<p>"Give me another thousand first!" screams a second, "or I will not
stir from the spot."</p>

<p>"You have given me two thousand too little!" exclaims a third; "but
here are my accounts, all perfectly straight."</p>

<p>"No, no; we protest against such an idea.  How, for what, and why, do
you claim that?"</p>

<p>Forgetting that the house was on fire, these strange fellows went on
squabbling where they were, till they were suffocated by the smoke, and
they and their goods were all burnt up together.</p>

<p>[This fable is said to refer to the squabbles which took place among
the Russian generals at the time of the French invasion.  Count
Rostopchin, for instance, withdrew from the Moscow Volunteer Committee
simply because it was made dependent on the Volunteer Committee of St.
Petersburg.  In many cases what was much worse than squabbling took
place, some of the officials being charged with having, even at that
critical period, "stolen all that could be stolen, the very clothes, the
very food of the recruits, of the volunteers, of the prisoners."]</p>

<h2 id="f009">THE CROW AND THE HEN.</h2>

<p>WHEN the Prince of Smolensk,<sup><a href="#f009_1">1</a></sup> using
skill as a weapon against insolence, laid a snare for the modern
Vandals, and left them Moscow for their ruin, then all its inhabitants,
old and young, assembled together without loss of time, and departed
from the city, like a swarm of bees leaving their hive.  On all the
disquiet which then took place a Crow looked down tranquilly from a
housetop, whetting its beak the while.</p>

<p>"What! are not you ready to start, gossip?" cried a Hen to it from a
passing cart.  "Why, they say the enemy is at our very gates.</p>

<p>"What is that to me?" replied the bird of omen.  "I shall remain here
quietly.  You and your sisters can do as you please.  But people don't
boil crows, or roast them either; so I shall have no difficulty in
living on good terms with the new-comers.  It may even happen, perhaps,
that I may get some cheese from them, or a stray bone, or something or
other.  Farewell, my fowl! a happy journey to you."</p>

<p>The Crow really did stay; but, instead of its gaining anything by
doing so, when the time came in which the Prince of Smolensk began to
starve his guests; it was itself seized by them, and turned into
soup.</p>

<p>[This fable was printed in the magazine called "The Son of the
Fatherland," in November, 1812.  Towards the end of September in that
year, news began to reach St.  Petersburg of the miserable state of
Napoleon's army.  "Eye-witnesses assert," said the preceding number of
the magazine, "that the French go out to shoot crows every day, and
cannot sufficiently praise their <i>soupe aux corbeaux</i>."  In the
same number appeared a caricature, styled "French crow-soup,"
representing four grenadiers, wounded, ragged, and emaciated, one of
whom is plucking a crow, while the others are getting ready a
carving-knife and a saucepan.  When Murat's travelling kitchen fell into
the hands of the Russians, the saucepans were full of horse and cat
flesh.  Later on in the retreat, a time came when some of the starving
soldiers actually preyed on the dead bodies of their comrades.]</p>

<p>A DIAMOND, which some one had lost, lay for some time on the high
road.  At last it happened that a merchant picked it up.  By him it was
offered to the king, who bought it, had it set in gold, and made it one
of the ornaments of the royal crown.  Having heard of this, a Pebble
began to make a fuss.  The brilliant fate of the Diamond fascinated it;
and, one day, seeing a Moujik passing, it besought him thus:</p>

<p>"Do me a kindness, fellow-countryman, and take me with you to the
capital.  Why should I go on suffering here in rain and mud, while our
Diamond is, men say, in honour there?  I don't understand why it has
been treated with such respect.  Side by side with me here it lay so
many years; it is just such a stone as I am&horbar;my close companion.
Do take me!  How can one tell?  If I am seen there, I too, perhaps, may
be found worthy of being turned to account."</p>

<p>The Moujik took the stone into his lumbering cart, and conveyed it to
the city.  Our stone tumbled into the cart, thinking that it would soon
be sitting by the side of the Diamond.  But a quite different fate
befell it.  It really was turned to account, but only to mend a hole in
the road.</p>

such a nature, that he was obliged to do as he was bid, whether he liked
it or not.  Our Goblin fell into a terrible perplexity, wondering how he
should preserve his treasure in his absence&horbar;who there was to take
charge of it.  To build a treasure-house, and hire a
guardian&horbar;that would cost much money.  To leave it to
itself&horbar;that way it might be lost.  Impossible to answer for it
for a day.  Some one might dig it up, and steal it:  people are quick at
scenting out money.  He worried himself; he pondered over it; and at
last an idea came into his head.  The master of the house to which he
was attached was a terrible Miser.  The Goblin, having dug up the
treasure, appeared to the Miser, and said,</p>

<p>"Dear master, they have ordered me to go away from your house to a
distant land.  But I have always been well disposed towards you, so
don't refuse to accept this treasure of mine, as a parting token of
affection.  Eat, drink, and be merry, and spend it without fear; only,
when you die, I am to be your sole heir That is my single stipulation.
As for the rest, may destiny grant you health and long life."</p>

<p>He spoke, and was off.</p>

<p>Ten&horbar;twenty years went by.  Having completed his service, the
Goblin flies home to his native land.  What does he see?  O rapturous
sight!  The Miser, dead from starvation, lies stretched on the strong
box, its key in his hand; and the ducats are all there intact.  So the
Goblin gets his treasure back again, and rejoices greatly to think that
it has had a guardian who did not cost him a single farthing.</p>

<p>[Krilof's remark at the end of this fable is&horbar;</p>

<p>"When a miser has money, and yet grudges to pay for food and drink,
is he not treasuring up his ducats for a goblin?"</p>

<p>M.  Parfait, the author of an excellent French translation of the
fables, observes that the same idea has been expressed by a popular
French poet, Pierre Dupont, who is not very likely to have read
Krilof:</p>

<blockquote>
"Tirez profit de cette fable,<br>
Vous tous qui rognez sur un liard;<br>
Vous th&eacute;saurisez pour le diable."
</blockquote>

<p>The goblin of the fable is the <i>domovoi</i>, or domestic spirit, in
whom the Russian peasant has great faith.  It is, probably, a near
relation of the lubber-fiend which, in Milton's country house,</p>

<blockquote>
"Basks at the fire its hairy strength,"
</blockquote>

<p>and of the well-known Scotch bogle, which, when its weary landlord
was <i>flitting</i> in order to get rid of it, exclaimed, from the
centre of the furniture-laden cart, "And I'm flittin', too."]</p>

<h2 id="f012">THE PIKE AND THE CAT.</h2>

<p>A CONCEITED Pike took it into its head to exercise the functions of a
cat.  I do not know whether the Evil One had plagued it with envy, or
whether, perhaps, it had grown tired of fishy fare; but, at all events,
it thought fit to ask the Cat to take it out to the chase, with the
intention of catching a few mice in the warehouse, "But, my dear
friend," Vaska says to the Pike, "do you understand that kind of work?
Take care, gossip, that you don't incur disgrace.  It isn't without
reason that they say, 'The work ought to be in the master's power.'"</p>

<p>"Why really, gossip, what a tremendous affair it is!  Mice, indeed!
Why, I have been in the habit of catching perches!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well.  Come along!"</p>

<p>They went; they lay each in ambush.  The Cat thoroughly enjoyed
itself; made a hearty meal; then went to look after its comrade.  Alas!
the Pike, almost destitute of life, lay there gasping, its tail nibbled
away by the mice.  So the Cat, seeing that its comrade had undertaken a
task quite beyond its strength, dragged it back, half dead, to its
pond.</p>

<p>[The Pike, in this fable, represents Admiral Tchichakof, who,
although a naval officer, was entrusted with the command of the troops
intended to prevent Napoleon from crossing the Berezina during the
retreat from Moscow.  With this view he was stationed at Borisof; but
the French surprised him there, and drove him out of the place, thereby
securing the passage of the river.  Sir Robert Wilson says the admiral
was at dinner when the enemy broke in upon his rear-guard, captured the
whole of his correspondence, and inflicted great loss on his troops.</p>

<p>In the Public Library at St.  Petersburg is a collection of
caricatures relating to the French invasion of Russia, one of which
represents Kutuzof holding one end of a long net; Napoleon, in the form
of a hare, is slipping out at the other end, which is held by
Tchichakof, who is exclaiming, "<i>Je le sauve.</i>"</p>

<p>Tchichakof is said to have been "an Englishman in character;" he had
learnt navigation in England, and had married an English woman.  "To a
sailor's bluntness he added the English reserve;" and this made his
countrymen dislike him from the first.  After the affair of the
Berezina, they despised him also.]</p>

<h2 id="f013">THE ASS AND THE NIGHTINGALE.</h2>

<p>AN Ass happened to see a Nightingale, one day, and said to it,</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear.  They say you have a great mastery over song.  I
have long wished very much to hear you sing, and to judge as to whether
your talent is really so great."</p>

<p>On this the Nightingale began to make manifest its
art&horbar;whistled in countless ways, sobbed, sustained notes, passed
from one song to another; at one time let her voice die away, and echoed
the distant murmur of the languishing reed; at another, poured through
the wood a shower of tiny notes.  Then all listened to the favourite
singer of Aurora.  The breezes died away; the feathered choir was
hushed; the cattle lay down on the grass.  Scarcely breathing, the
shepherd revelled in it, and only now and then, as he listened to it,
smiled on the shepherdess.</p>

<p>At length the singer ended.  Then the Ass, bending its head towards
the ground, observed,</p>

<p>"It's tolerable.  To speak the truth, one can listen to you without
being bored.  But it's a pity you don't know our Cock.  You would sing a
great deal better if you were to take a few lessons from him."</p>

<p>Having heard such a judgment, our poor Nightingale took to its wings
and flew far away.</p>

<p>[It is said that Krilof wrote this fable after an interview with some
great man (Count Razumofsky or Prince A. N. Galitzin, perhaps), who had
asked him to read him some of his fables.  After hearing them, the noble
patron of letters said, "That is very good; but why don't you translate,
as Dmitrief does?"  "I cannot," modestly answered the poet, who returned
home, and straightway wrote down the grandee an ass.</p>

<p>M.  Fleury ranks this piece among the imitations; and it is true that
the same subject has been admirably treated by Diderot.  But the idea
may easily have occurred to Krilof without his having read Diderot's
excellent fable.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f014">THE HOP-PLANT.</h2>

<p>A HOP-PLANT had made its way to the edge of a garden, and had begun
to wind itself around a dry stake in the fence.  Now, in the open field
beyond stood an oak-sapling.</p>

<p>"What use is there in that stunted creature, or, indeed, in any of
its kind?"  Thus about the oak the Hop used to whisper to the stake.
"How can it even be compared with you?  You, simply by your erect
carriage, look like a perfect lady in its presence.  It is true that it
is clothed with foliage; but how rough it is! what a colour it has!  Why
ever does the earth nourish it?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a week had scarcely passed, before the owner broke up that
stake for firewood, and transplanted the young oak into his garden.  His
care resulted in full success, and the oak flourished, extending
vigorous shoots.  Remarking this, our Hop-plant wound itself about it,
and now its voice is entirely devoted to the oak's glory and honour.</p>

<h2 id="f015">TRISHKA'S CAFTAN.</h2>

<p>TRISHKA'S caftan was out at elbows.  Why should he ponder long over
it?  He took to his needle, cut a quarter off each sleeve; so mended the
elbows.  The caftan was all right again, only his arms were bare for a
quarter of their length.  That is no great matter; but every one is
always laughing at Trishka.  So Trishka says,</p>

<p>"As I'm no fool, I'll set this affair straight also.  I'll make the
sleeves longer than they were before.  Oh!  Trishka is no common-place
fellow."</p>

<p>So he cut off the skirts of his caftan, and used them to lengthen his
sleeve.  Then Trishka was happy, though he had a caftan which was as
short as a waistcoat.  In a similar way have I sometimes seen other
embarrassed people set their affairs straight.  Take a look at them as
they dash away.  They have all got on Trishka's caftan.</p>

<p>[An allusion to the ruinous shifts to which the Russian proprietors
used to have recourse when their affairs became at all embarrassed.
They are beginning to be less improvident now; but, at the time when
Krilof wrote the fable, they used to be notorious for their readiness to
adopt any means which would afford them a temporary relief.  It may
easily be imagined how the unfortunate peasants must have suffered
whenever their masters were seized by one of these reckless fits.]</p>

<h2 id="f016">THE ELEPHANT AS GOVERNOR.</h2>

<p>AN Elephant was once appointed ruler of a forest.  Now, it is well
known that the race of elephants is endowed with great intelligence; but
every family has its unworthy scion.  Our Governor was as stout as the
rest of his race are, but as foolish as the rest of his race are not.
As to his character, he would not intentionally hurt a fly.  Well, the
worthy Governor becomes aware of a petition laid before him by the
Sheep, stating that their skins are entirely torn off their backs by the
Wolves.</p>

<p>"Oh, rogues!" cries the Elephant, "what a crime!  Who gave you leave
to plunder?"</p>

<p>But the Wolves say,</p>

<p>"Allow us to explain, O father.  Did not you give us leave to take
from the Sheep a trifling contribution<sup><a href="#f016_1">1</a></sup>
for our pelisses in winter?  It is only because they are stupid sheep
that they cry out.  They have only a single fleece taken from each of
them, but they grumble about giving even that!"</p>

<p>"Well, well," says the Elephant, "take care what you do.  I will not
permit any one to commit injustice.  As it must be so, take a fleece
from each of them.  But do not take from them a single hair
besides."</p>

<p>He who has rank and power, but wants sense, however good his heart
may be, is sure to do harm.</p>

<h2 id="f017">THE POOR MAN ENRICHED.</h2>

<p>"IS IT worth while being rich, if one is never to eat or drink
delicately, and to do nothing but heap up money?  And to what end?  We
die, and then leave all behind.  We only torment ourselves, and get a
bad name.  No; if riches had fallen to my share, not only roubles, but
even thousands of them wouldn't have been grudged by me, so long as I
could live sumptuously and luxuriously; and my feasts should have been
talked about far and wide.  Besides, I should have done good to others.
To rich misers, their life is a kind of torment."</p>

<p>So reasoned a Poor Man with himself, lying on the bare boards in a
wretched hovel.  Suddenly, gliding to his side through a chink, there
appeared&horbar;some say a wizard, others say the Evil One (most likely
the latter, as the end of the story will show), and began to speak
thus:</p>

<p>"You wish to be rich; I have heard you say why.  I am glad to help a
friend, so here is a purse for you; there is a ducat in it&horbar;no
more.  But, as soon as you have taken one coin out of it, you will find
another in it all ready for you.  So now, my friend, your growing rich
depends entirely upon your own wishes.  Take the purse, and freely
supply yourself from it until your craving is satisfied.  Only bear this
in mind,&horbar;until you shall have flung the purse into the river, you
are forbidden to spend a single ducat"</p>

<p>He spoke, and left the purse with the Poor Man. The Poor Man was
almost beside himself for joy.  But, as soon as he returned to his
senses, he began to handle the purse; and with what result?  Scarcely
could he believe it was not a dream.  He had hardly taken one ducat out,
before another was already stirring in the purse.  Our needy friend says
to himself,</p>

<p>"I will shake out a heap of ducats.  Then, to-morrow I shall be rich,
and I will begin to live like a Sybarite."</p>

<p>But the next morning he had changed his mind.</p>

<p>"It's true," he says, "I am rich now.  But who isn't glad to get hold
of a good thing? and why shouldn't I become twice as rich?  It surely
wouldn't be laziness in me to spend another day over the purse.  Here I
have money for a mansion, an equipage, a country house.  But if I might
buy estates too, wouldn't it be stupid in me to lose such an
opportunity?  Yes, I will keep the wonderful purse.  So be it:  I will
fast one day more.  As to that, I shall always have time enough for
luxurious living."</p>

<p>But what happens?  A day goes by, and then a week, a month, a year.
Our Poor Man has long ago lost all count of the ducats.  Meanwhile, he
eats scantily, and drinks scantily.  Scarcely has the day begun to break
before he is back at the old work.  The day comes to an end; but,
according to his calculations, something or other is still sure to be
wanting.  Sometimes he makes up his mind to throw away the purse.  But
then his heart grows faint within him.  He reaches the bank of the
river, and&horbar;then turns back again.</p>

<p>"How can I possibly part with the purse," he says, "while it yields a
stream of gold of its own accord?"</p>

<p>By this time our poor friend has grown grey, and thin, and as yellow
as his own gold.  He no more so much as thinks about luxury now.  He has
become faint and feeble; health and rest have utterly deserted him.  But
still with trembling hand he goes on taking ducats out of the purse.  He
takes, and takes; and how does it all end?  On the bench on which he
used to sit gloating over his wealth&horbar;on that very bench he dies,
in the act of counting the last coins of his ninth million.</p>

<h2 id="f018">THE QUARTETTE.</h2>

<p>THE tricksy Monkey, the Goat, the Ass, and bandy-legged Mishka, the
Bear, determine to play a quartette.  They provide themselves with the
necessary pieces of music&horbar;with two fiddles, and with an alto and
a counter-bass.  Then they sit down on a meadow under a lime-tree,
prepared to enchant the world by their skill.  They work away at their
fiddlesticks with a will; and they make a noise, but there is no music
in it.</p>

<p>"Stop, brothers, stop!" cries the Monkey, "wait a little!  How can we
get our music right?  It's plain, you mustn't sit as you are.  You,
Mishka, with your counter-bass, face the alto.  I will sit opposite the
second fiddle.  Then a different sort of music will begin:  we shall set
the very hills and forests dancing."</p>

<p>So they change places, and recommence; but the music is just as
discordant as before.</p>

<p>"Stop a little," exclaims the Ass; "I have found out the secret.  We
shall be sure to play in tune if we sit in a row."</p>

<p>They follow its advice, and form in an orderly line.  But the
quartette is as unmusical as ever.  Louder than before there arose among
them squabbling and wrangling as to how they ought to be seated.  It
happened that a Nightingale came flying that way, attracted by their
noise.  At once they all intreat it to solve their difficulty.</p>

<p>"Be so kind," they say, "as to bear with us a little, in order that
our quartette may come off properly.  Music we have; instruments we
have:  tell us only how we ought to place ourselves."</p>

<p>But the Nightingale replies,</p>

<p>"To be a musician, one must have a quicker intelligence and a finer
ear than you possess.  You, my friends, may place yourselves just as you
like, but you will never become musicians."</p>

<p>[Some writers say this fable alludes to the foundation, in March,
1811, of the "Society of Lovers of Russian Literature," which had four
departments, and seemed more like a public office than a literary
institution, and the members of which had places allotted to them
according to their rank rather than to their talents.  But Baron Korf
says it refers to the disputes about places which arose among the first
Presidents of the four departments of the Imperial Council, at the time
of its reconstruction, in the year 1810.]</p>

<h2 id="f019">THE INQUISITIVE MAN.</h2>

<p>"GOOD day, dear friend; where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"From the Museum, where I have spent three hours.  I saw everything
they have there, and examined it carefully.  So much have I seen to
astonish me, that, if you will believe me, I am neither strong enough
nor clever enough to give you a full description of it.  Upon my word it
is a palace of wonders.  How rich Nature is in invention!  What birds
and beasts haven't I seen there!  What flies, butterflies, cockroaches,
little bits of beetles!&horbar;some like emeralds, others like coral.
And what tiny cochineal insects!  Why, really, some of them are smaller
than a pin's head."</p>

<p>"But did you see the elephant?  What did you think it looked like?
I'll be bound you felt as if you were looking at a mountain."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure it's there?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"Well, brother, you mustn't be too hard upon me; but, to tell the
truth, I didn't remark the elephant."</p>

<p>[Bulgarine states that Krilof wrote this fable in allusion to the
remark of some one, perhaps Prince Viazemsky, that each of the three
great fabulists, La Fontaine, Khemnitser, and Dmitrief, bore the name of
Ivan,&horbar;thus omitting all notice of Ivan Krilof.  But the story
does not seem to rest on any substantial authority, and it is entirely
out of keeping with all the other anecdotes about Krilof, who was
remarkably modest and unpretentious.]</p>

<h2 id="f020">THE COOK AND THE CAT.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN Cook, rather more educated than his fellows, went from his
kitchen one day to a neighbouring tavern&horbar;he was of a serious turn
of mind, and on that day he celebrated the anniversary of a friend's
death&horbar;leaving a Cat at home, to guard his viands from the mice.
On his return, what does he see?  The floor strewed with fragments of a
pie, and Vaska the Cat crouching in a corner behind a vinegar-barrel,
purring with satisfaction, and busily engaged in disposing of a
chicken.</p>

<p>"Ah, glutton! ah, evil-doer!" exclaims the reproachful Cook.  "Are
you not ashamed of being seen by these walls, let alone living
witnesses?  What! be an honourable Cat up to this time&horbar;one who
might be pointed out as a model of discretion!  And now, ah me! how
great a disgrace!  Now all the neighbours will say, 'The cat Vaska is a
rogue; the cat Vaska is a thief.  Vaska must not be admitted into the
kitchen, not even into the courtyard, any more than a ravenous wolf into
the sheepfold.  He is utterly corrupt; he is a pest, the plague of the
neighbourhood.'"</p>

<p>Thus did our orator, letting loose the current of his words, lecture
away without stopping.  But what was the result?  While he was
delivering his discourse, Vaska the Cat ate up the whole of the
chicken.</p>

<p>I would advise some cooks to inscribe these words on their walls:
"Don't waste time in useless speech, when it is action that is
needed."</p>

<p>A CERTAIN man invited a neighbour to dinner, not without an ulterior
purpose.  He was fond of music, and he entrapped his neighbour into his
house to listen to his choir.  The honest fellows began to sing, each on
his own account, and each with all his might.  The guest's ears began to
split, and his head to turn.</p>

<p>"Have pity on me!" he exclaimed, in amazement, "What can any one like
in all this?  Why, your choristers bawl like madmen."</p>

<p>"It's quite true," replied the host, with feeling.  "They do flay
one's ears just a trifle.  But, on the other hand, they are all of
irreproachable behaviour, and they never touch a drop of intoxicating
liquor."</p>

<h2 id="f022">THE PEASANT AND THE LABOURER.</h2>

<p>AN old Peasant and a Labourer were going home through the forest to
the village one evening, in the time of the hay-harvest, when they
suddenly found themselves face to face with a bear.  Scarcely had the
Peasant time to utter a cry when the bear was upon him; it threw him
down, rolled him over, made his bones crack again, and began looking
about for a soft spot at which to commence its meal.  Death draws near
to the old man.</p>

<p>"Stefan, my kinsman, my dear friend, do not desert me!" he cries,
from under the bear, to the Labourer.</p>

<p>Then Stefan, putting forth all his strength like a new Hercules,
splits the bear's head in two with his axe, and drives his pitchfork
into its bowels.  The bear howls, and falls dying.  Our bear
expires.</p>

<p>The danger having vanished, the Peasant gets up, and soundly scolds
the Labourer.  Our poor Stefan is astounded.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, what have I done?"</p>

<p>"What have you done, you blockhead?  I'd like to know what you are so
absurdly pleased about; why, you've gone and struck the bear in such a
manner that you've utterly ruined his fur!"</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f023">THE BEAR AMONG THE BEES.</h2>

<p>THE beasts elected the Bear, one spring, Inspector of the Beehives.
They might, it is true, have chosen a more trustworthy animal, seeing
that the Bear is passionately fond of honey.  The matter was one to be
regretted; but who can expect wisdom from beasts?  Every other solicitor
for the post of Hive Inspector they sent away with a refusal, and
finally, as if by way of pleasantry, the Bear made his appearance in
that capacity.  But harm soon came of the appointment for our Bear
carried off all the honey into his den.  The theft was found out, an
alarm was sounded, and legal proceedings were taken in due form.
Eventually, the Bear was dismissed from his office, and the old rogue
was sentenced to lie in his den all the winter.</p>

<p>The Court decided, ratified, and countersigned; but, in spite of all
this, it did not return the honey.  As for Mishka, he didn't pay the
slightest attention to the affair.  Bidding the world farewell for a
season, he betook himself to his warm den.  There he sucks his honeyed
paw, and waits till fair weather invites him to a fresh cruise.</p>

<p>[At the time when Krilof wrote, extortion and corruption were
scandalously rife in Russia.  The Government strove hard to put down the
extortioners, and the Press did all that it could, in its fettered
condition, to aid in so good a cause.  But, in spite of all that could
be done, the evil went on flourishing.  As soon as Alexander I. came to
the throne, he issued an edict against exactions of every kind; and in
1809, when the great abuses in the Commissariat Department had been
brought to light, he renewed the old ukases of Peter the Great and
Catherine II.  The first, published in 1714, orders that all persons
convicted of extorting money and taking bribes shall undergo severe
corporal punishment, shall forfeit all their property, and shall be
"treated as rascals, and turned out of the list of honest people."  The
second, of the date of 1763, ordains that they shall be "not only turned
out of the ranks of honest people, but eliminated from the entire human
race."  But, notwithstanding all these energetic declarations, the
forbidden practices remained unchecked; and, to the end of Alexander's
reign, each year saw a new edict issued on the subject.  In 1816,
especially, a vigorous attempt was made to produce a reform, and a
re-script was addressed to the Minister of Justice, bidding him see that
the law courts should be rendered the means of maintaining right, not of
confirming wrong; and that assistance should be given to the weak and
needy in their appeals against oppression.  But it too often occurred
that, when some great man had been detected in robbing the poor, the
only punishment he underwent was a nominal banishment to his estates,
where he enjoyed, like the Bear, the fruits of his villainy, and waited
till the temporary ill wind should have blown over.]</p>

<h2 id="f024">THE HORSE AND THE DOG.</h2>

<p>A DOG and a Horse, which served the same peasant, began to discuss
each other's merits, one day.</p>

<p>"How grand we are, to be sure!" says Barbos.  "I shouldn't be sorry
if they were to turn you out of the farmyard.  A noble service, indeed,
to plough or to draw a cart!  And I've never heard of any other proof of
your merit.  How can you possibly compare yourself with me?  I rest
neither by day nor by night.  In the daytime I watch the cattle in the
meadows; by night I guard the house."</p>

<p>"Quite true," replied the Horse.  "What you say is perfectly correct.
Only remember that, if it weren't for my ploughing, you wouldn't have
anything at all to guard here."</p>

<p>"No matter; just a little plateful.  Believe me, the soup is cooked
gloriously."</p>

<p>"But I've had three platefuls already."</p>

<p>"Well, what does that matter?  If you like it and it does you good,
why not eat it all up?  What a soup it is!  How rich!  It looks as if it
had been sprinkled over with amber.  Here is bream; there is a lump of
sterlet.  Take a little more, dear, kind friend.  Just another spoonful!
Wife, come and intreat him."</p>

<p>Thus does Demian feast his neighbour Phocas, not giving him a
moment's breathing-time.  Phocas feels the moisture trickling down his
forehead; still he takes one more plateful, attacks it with all the
strength he has left, and somehow manages to swallow the whole of
it.</p>

<p>"That's the sort of friend I like!" cries Demian.  "I can't bear
people who require pressing.  But now, dear friend, take just one little
plateful more!"</p>

<p>But, on hearing this, our poor Phocas, much as he liked fish soup,
catching hold of his cap and sash, runs away home without looking behind
him.  Nor from that day to this has he crossed Demian's threshold.</p>

<p>[There was a meeting one day, at the house of the poet Derjavine, of
the members of the "Society of the Lovers of Russian Literature."
Krilof had promised to attend, and to read one of his new and, as yet,
unpublished fables; but he did not appear till very late.  When he
arrived, some one was reading an exceedingly long poem, which went on
and on until the audience was utterly worn out.  At last, however, it
came to an end.  Then Krilof was asked to read his poem; so he put his
hand in his pocket, produced a piece of paper, and read "Demian's Fish
Soup."  It is easy to imagine how thoroughly it was appreciated by an
audience which had just been suffering tortures at the hands of a
literary Demian&horbar;one of those authors who, when they have once
secured a hearing, never know when it is time to leave off.]</p>

<h2 id="f026">THE WOLVES AND THE SHEEP.</h2>

<p>THE Sheep could not live in peace on account of the Wolves, and the
evil increased to such a pitch, that at last the rulers of the beasts
had to take vigorous steps towards interfering and saving the victims.
With that intent a council was summoned.  The majority of its members,
it is true, were Wolves; but then all Wolves are not badly spoken of.
There have been Wolves known, and that often (such instances are never
forgotten), to have walked past a flock quite peacefully&horbar;when
completely gorged.  So why should not Wolves have seats in the council?
Although it was necessary to protect the Sheep, yet there was no reason
for utterly suppressing the Wolves.</p>

<p>Well, the meeting took place in the thick wood.  They pondered,
considered, harangued, and at last framed a decree.  Here you have it,
word for word:&horbar;"As soon as a Wolf shall have disturbed a flock,
and shall have begun to worry a Sheep, then the Sheep shall be allowed,
without respect to persons, to seize it by the scruff of the neck, to
carry it into the nearest thicket or wood, and there to bring it before
the court"</p>

<p>This law is everything that can be desired.  Only, I have remarked,
up to the present day, that although the Wolves are not to be allowed to
worry with impunity, yet in all cases, whether the Sheep be plaintiff or
defendant, the Wolf is always sure, in spite of all opposition, to carry
off the Sheep into the forest.</p>

<h2 id="f027">THE MAN AND HIS SHADOW.</h2>

<p>THERE was a certain original who must needs desire to catch his own
Shadow.  He makes a step or two towards it, but it moves away before
him.  He quickens his pace; it does the same.  At last he takes to
running; but the quicker he goes, the quicker runs the Shadow also,
utterly refusing to give itself up, just as if it had been a treasure.
But see! our eccentric friend suddenly turns round, and walks away from
it.  And presently he looks behind him; the Shadow runs after him
now.</p>

<p>Ladies fair, I have often observed&horbar;&horbar;what do you
suppose?&horbar;no, no; I assure you I am not going to speak about
you&horbar;&horbar;that Fortune treats us in a similar way.  One man
tries with all his might to seize the goddess, and only loses his time
and his trouble.  Another seems, to all appearance, to be running out of
her sight; but, no:  she herself takes a pleasure in pursuing him.</p>

<h2 id="f028">THE WOLF AND ITS CUB.</h2>

<p>A WOLF, which had begun to accustom its Cub to support itself by its
father's profession, sent it one day to prowl about the skirts of the
wood.  At the same time it ordered it to give all its attention to
seeing whether it would not be possible, even at the cost of sinning a
little, for them both to make their breakfast or dinner at the expense
of some shepherd or other.  The pupil returns home, and says&horbar;</p>

<p>"Come along, quick!  Our dinner awaits us:  nothing could possibly be
safer.  There are sheep feeding at the foot of yon hill, each one fatter
than the other.  We have only to choose which to carry off and eat; and
the flock is so large that it would be difficult to count it over
again&horbar;&horbar;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," says the Wolf.  "First of all I must know what sort
of a man the shepherd of this flock is."</p>

<p>"It is said that he is a good one&horbar;painstaking and intelligent.
But I went round the flock on all sides, and examined the dogs:  they
are not at all fat, and seem to be spiritless and indolent."</p>

<p>"This description," says the old Wolf, "does not greatly attract me
to the flock.  For, decidedly, if the shepherd is good, he will not keep
bad dogs about him.  One might very soon get into trouble there.  But
come with me:  I will take you to a flock where we shall be in less
danger of losing our skins.  Over that flock it is true that a great
many dogs watch; but the shepherd is himself a fool.  And where the
shepherd is a fool, there the dogs too are of little worth."</p>

<h2 id="f029">THE DANCING FISH.</h2>

<p>HAVING waters as well as woods in his dominions, the Lion called the
beasts together to a council, to consider who should be appointed
governor of the Fish.  They gave their votes in the usual manner, and
the Fox was chosen.  Well, the Fox sat in the governor's seat, and
visibly waxed fat.  He had a Moujik as friend, kinsman, and gossip, and
the two used to lay their heads together.  The Fox conducted business
and pronounced legal decisions on the shore; and meantime his gossip
angled after the Fish, and, like a trusty comrade, shared what he caught
with his friend.  But rogues do not always succeed.  The Lion somehow
grew suspicious, from rumours it heard, that the scales had been
falsified in its law courts; so, having found a leisure time, it
determined to investigate the state of its dominions.</p>

<p>Having gone to the shore, it found that the good gossip had caught
some fish, and had kindled a fire by the river-side, intending to feast
on them with his comrade.  The poor fish were bounding into the air to
get away from the heat, each one to the best of its power:  each one,
seeing its end close at hand, flung itself about, gaping at the
Moujik.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what are you doing?" angrily asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Great king!" answers the chief rogue&horbar;the Fox always has a
trick in reserve&horbar;"great king! this is my chief secretary here,
who is esteemed for his probity by all the nation; and these are carp,
all inhabitants of the waters.  We have all come here to congratulate
you, our good king, on your arrival."</p>

<p>"Well, how is justice dispensed here?  Is your district content?"</p>

<p>"Great king! here they do not merely live; they are in Paradise.  If
only your royal life may be prolonged!"  (All this time the fish were
leaping about in the pan.)</p>

<p>"But tell me," said the Lion, "why do they fling themselves about
topsy-turvy in this manner?"</p>

<p>"O wise Lion," replied the Fox, "they are dancing for joy at seeing
you."</p>

<p>Not being able to stand such a manifest fiction as this, the Lion, in
order that there should be some music for its subjects to dance to, made
the secretary and the governor both sing out under its claws.</p>

<p>[This fable, as originally written by Krilof, ended as follows:</p>

<p>"O wise Lion," replied the Fox, "they are dancing for joy at seeing
you."  Then the Lion, tapping the Starost kindly on the breast,
proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p>But the censor objected that this seemed like a reflection on the
Emperor Alexander, who was then&horbar;it was in the year
1824&horbar;making what was destined to be his last journey through
Russia.  Krilof at first refused to make any alteration; but eventually
he modified the fable, and added the lines with which it now
concludes.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that, during one of his travels in the interior,
the Emperor Alexander I. spent a night, in some city or other, in the
governor's house.  The next morning, just as he was on the point of
continuing his journey, he happened to look out of window, and saw a
great crowd collected in front of the house.  The governor, being asked
what was the cause of it, replied that it was a deputation of the
inhabitants, who wished to thank the Emperor for the happy lives they
led.  As the Emperor was in a hurry to get away, he declined to receive
the deputation, and drove off.</p>

<p>Afterwards it turned out that the people had come to complain of
their governor, who oppressed them terribly.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f030">THE PIKE.</h2>

<p>AN appeal to justice was made against the Pike, on the ground that it
had rendered the pond uninhabitable.  A whole cart-load of proofs were
tendered as evidence; and the culprit, as was beseeming, was brought
into court in a large tub.  The judges were assembled not far off,
having been set to graze in a neighbouring field.  Their names are still
preserved in the archives.  There were two Donkeys, a couple of old
Horses, and two or three Goats.  The Fox also was added to their number,
as assessor, in order that the business might be carried on under
competent supervision.</p>

<p>Now, popular report said that the Pike used to supply the table of
the Fox with fish.  However this might be, there was no partiality among
the judges; and it must also be stated that it was impossible to conceal
the Pike's roguery in the affair in question.  So there was no help for
it.  Sentence was passed, condemning the Pike to an ignominious
punishment.  In order to frighten others, it was to be hung from a
tree.</p>

<p>"Respected judges," thus did the Fox begin to speak, "hanging is a
trifle.  I should have liked to have sentenced the culprit to such a
punishment as has never been seen here among us.  In order that rogues
may in future live in fear, and run a terrible risk, I would drown it in
the river."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cry the judges, and unanimously accept the
proposition.</p>

<p>So the Pike was flung&horbar;into the river.</p>

<h2 id="f031">THE GEESE.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT, with a long rod in his hand, was driving some Geese to a
town where they were to be sold and, to tell the truth, he did not treat
them over-politely.  In hopes of making a good bargain, he was hastening
on so as not to lose the market-day (and when gain is concerned, geese
and men alike are apt to suffer).  I do not blame the peasant; but the
Geese talked about him in a different spirit, and, whenever they met any
passers-by, abused him to them in such terms as these:</p>

<p>"Is it possible to find any Geese more unfortunate than we are?  This
Moujik harasses us so terribly, and chases us about just as if we were
common Geese.  The ignoramus does not know that he ought to pay us
reverence, seeing that we are the noble descendants of those geese to
whom Rome was once indebted for her salvation, and in whose honour even
feast-days were specially appointed there."</p>

<p>"And do you want to have honour paid you on that account?" a
passer-by asked them.</p>

<p>"Why, our ancestors&horbar;"</p>

<p>"I know that&horbar;I have read all about it; but I want to know
this&horbar;of what use have you been yourselves?"</p>

<p>"Why, our ancestors saved Rome!"</p>

<p>"Quite so; but what have you done?"</p>

<p>"We?  Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then what merit is there in you?  Let your ancestors rest in
peace&horbar;they justly received honourable reward; but you, my
friends, are only fit to be roasted!"</p>

<p>It would be easy to make this fable still more intelligible; but I am
afraid of irritating the Geese.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f032">THE LION AND THE PANTHER.</h2>

<p>ONCE on a time, in ancient days, the Lion maintained a very long
contest with the Panther about certain disputed forests, valleys, and
caves.  To go to law about their rights&horbar;this was not in
accordance with their characters; for, in matters relating to law, the
strong are often blind.  For such affairs they have their own
rule,&horbar;"Who conquers is right."  But at last, that they might not
eternally squabble, with claws ever becoming more blunt, our heroes
determined to submit their dispute to law.  Their intention was to put
an end to their fighting, to settle all hostilities, and then, as is
customary, to conclude a peace which should last
uninterrupted&horbar;until the next quarrel.</p>

<p>"Let us each choose a secretary at once," proposes the Panther to the
Lion, "and decide according as the two secretaries shall advise.  I, for
instance, will choose the Cat.  It is not a very good-looking little
animal; but, then, its conscience is clear.  But do you, for your part,
nominate the Ass, for it belongs to a distinguished order in the state;
and, to tell the truth, you will have in it a very enviable beast.
Trust me as a friend in this.  All your court and council together are
scarcely worth its hoof.  Let us accept whatever arrangements it and my
Cat may make."</p>

<p>And the Lion sanctioned the first part of the Panther's scheme
without opposition; only he chose the Fox, instead of the Ass, to
represent him in the discussion, saying to himself, after so doing,</p>

<p>"Truly, there is but little good to be gained from him whom an enemy
recommends."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f033">THE COMB.</h2>

<p>A LOVING mother bought a good strong Comb to keep her boy's hair in
order.  The child never let his new present go out of his hands.
Whether playing or learning his alphabet, he was always lovingly passing
his Comb through the twining curls of his waving golden hair, soft as
fine flax.  And what a Comb it was!  Not only did it not pull out his
hair, but it never even got caught in it; so smoothly and easily did it
glide through his locks.  It was a priceless Comb in the eyes of the
child.  But at last it happened, one day, that the Comb was mislaid.
Our boy went playing and romping about, until he got his hair into a
regular tangle.  Scarcely had the nurse touched it, when he began to
howl,</p>

<p>"Where is my Comb?"</p>

<p>At last it was found; but when they tried to pass it through his
locks, it could not be moved either backwards or forwards:  all it did
was to pull his hair out by the roots, so as to bring the tears into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"How wicked you are, you bad Comb!" cries the boy.</p>

<p>But the Comb replies,</p>

<p>"My dear, I am what I always was; only your hair has become
tangled."</p>

<p>Whereupon our young friend, giving way to rage and vexation, flings
his Comb into the river.  And now the Naiads comb their hair with
it.</p>

<p>In my time I have often seen men behave in a like manner towards the
truth.  As long as we have a clear conscience, truth is agreeable to us,
we hold it sacred, we listen to it and obey it; but as soon as a man has
begun to do violence to his conscience, the truth becomes alien to his
ears.  Then every one resembles the boy who did not like to have his
hair combed after it had got into a tangle.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f034">THE AUTHOR AND THE ROBBER.</h2>

<p>IN the gloomy realm of shadows, two sinners appeared before the
judges for sentence at the very same time.  The one was a Robber, who
used to extract tribute on the highway, and who had at last come to the
gallows; the other an Author, covered with glory, who had infused a
subtle poison into his works, had promoted atheism, and had preached
immorality, being, like the Siren, sweet-voiced, and, like the Siren,
dangerous.  In Hades judical<sup><a href="#f034_1">1</a></sup>
ceremonies are brief; there are no useless delays.  Sentence was
pronounced immediately.  Two huge iron cauldrons were suspended in the
air by two tremendous iron chains; in each of these one of the sinners
was placed.  Under the Robber a great pile of wood was heaped up, and
then one of the Furies herself set it on fire, kindling such a terrible
flame, that the very stone in the roof of the infernal halls began to
crack.  The Author's sentence did not seem to be a severe one.  Under
him, at first, a little fire scarcely glowed; but, the longer it burned,
the larger it became.</p>

<p>Centuries have now gone by, but the fire has not gone out.  Beneath
the Robber the flame has long ago been extinguished; beneath the Author
it grows hourly worse and worse.  Seeing that there is no mitigation of
his torments, the writer at last cries out amidst them that there is no
justice among the gods; that he had filled the world with his renown;
and that, if he had written a little too freely, he had been punished
too much for it; and that he did not think he had sinned more than the
Robber.  Then before him, in all her ornaments, with snakes hissing amid
her hair, and with bloody scourges in her hands, appeared one of the
three Infernal Sisters.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" she exclaims, "dost thou upbraid Providence?  Dost thou
compare thyself with this robber?  His crime is as nothing compared with
thine.  Only as long as he lived did his cruelty and lawlessness render
him hurtful.  But thou&horbar;long ago have thy bones turned to dust,
yet the sun never rises without bringing to light fresh evils of which
thou art the cause.  The poison of thy writings not only does not
weaken, but, spreading abroad, it becomes more malignant as years roll
by.  Look there!" and for a moment she enables him to look upon the
world; "behold the crimes, the misery, of which thou art the cause.
Look at those children who have brought shame upon their families, who
have reduced their parents to despair.  By whom were their heads and
hearts corrupted?  By thee.  Who strove to rend asunder the bonds of
society, ridiculing as childish follies all ideas of the sanctity of
marriage and the right of authority and law, and rendering them
responsible for all human misfortunes?  Thou art the man!  Didst thou
not dignify unbelief with the name of enlightenment?  Didst thou not
place vice and passion in the most charming and alluring of lights?  And
now look!&horbar;a whole country, perverted by thy teaching, is full of
murder and robbery, of strife and rebellion, and is being led onwards by
thee to ruin.  For every drop of that country's tears and blood thou art
to blame.  And now dost thou dare to hurl thy blasphemies against the
gods?  How much evil have thy books yet to bring upon the world?
Continue, then, to suffer; for here the measure of thy punishment shall
be according to thy deserts."  Thus spoke the angry Fury, and slammed
down the cover on the cauldron.</p>

<p>[There seems to be little doubt that Krilof was thinking of Voltaire
when he wrote this somewhat violent diatribe.  "We prefer to believe,"
says the French translator of Krilof, in a note on this passage, "that,
in spite of his errors, the apostle of universal toleration, the ardent
promoter of so many useful and humane reforms, the zealous defender of
so many innocent persons, will find less severity in his real Judge than
he finds here in the Minos of the fable."]</p>

<h2 id="f035">THE HIND AND THE DERVISH.</h2>

<p>A YOUNG Hind, bereft of her much-loved fawns, and still having her
udders full of milk, found two young wolves deserted in a forest, and
immediately began to fulfil the sacred duty of a mother towards them,
feeding them with her milk.  A Dervish, who inhabited the same forest,
astonished at this proceeding of hers, cried out&horbar;</p>

<p>"Imprudent creature that thou art!  On what kind of animal art thou
conferring thy milk? on what art thou wasting thy affections?  Is it
possible that thou canst expect gratitude from such as they are?  Or is
it that thou dost not know their evil nature?  Some day, perhaps, it
will be thy blood that they will drink."</p>

<p>"It may be so, indeed," replied the Hind; "but I did not think, nor
do I wish to think, of that.  It is only as a mother that I care to feel
just now; and my milk would have been a burden to me if I had not given
suck to these little ones."</p>

<p>Thus genuine charity does good without thinking of recompense.  To
the really benevolent, their abundance would be burdensome if they could
not share it with those who are in want.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f036">CANINE FRIENDSHIP.</h2>

<p>Under a kitchen window lay Barbos and Polkan, basking in the
sunshine.  It would have been more fitting in them to have been guarding
the house at the gate in front of the courtyard.  But they had eaten
till they were satiated, and, besides, polite dogs do not bark at any
one in the day-time.  So they indulged in a discussion about all sorts
of things&horbar;about their doggish service, about good and evil, and
finally about friendship.</p>

<p>"What," says Polkan, "can be pleasanter than to live heart to heart
with a friend?&horbar;in everything to offer mutual service; not to
sleep or eat without one's friend, and to defend his body with all one's
force; finally, for friends to look into one another's eyes, and each to
think that only a fortunate hour in which he could please or amuse his
friend, and to place all his own happiness in his friend's good fortune!
Suppose, for instance, you and I were to contract such a friendship.  I
venture to say, we should not be able to tell how quickly time was
flying."</p>

<p>"That is true.  So be it," replies Barbos.  "Long has it been
grievous to me, my dear Polkan, that we, who are dogs of the same yard,
cannot spend a single day without quarrelling:  and why is it?  Thanks
to our master, we are neither closely pent nor scantily fed.  Besides,
it really is scandalous.  From the earliest times the dog has been the
type of friendship; yet you scarcely ever see any more friendship among
dogs than among men."</p>

<p>"Let us make manifest an instance of it to our own times," says
Polkan.</p>

<p>"Your paw!"</p>

<p>"There it is."</p>

<p>Straightway the new friends begin to caress and fondle each other.
They know not, in their raptures, to what to liken themselves.</p>

<p>"My Orestes!"</p>

<p>"My Pylades!"</p>

<p>"Away with all quarrels, all envy, all malice!"</p>

<p>Unluckily, at this moment the cook tosses a bone out of the kitchen.
Our new friends fling themselves upon it furiously.  What has become of
their harmonious alliance?  Orestes and Pylades seize each other by the
throat, so that their hair goes flying to the winds, and even torrents
of water will scarcely separate them.</p>

<p>The world is full of such friendships.  One would not be far wrong if
one said of friends, as they are now-a-days, that they are almost all
alike in respect to their friendship.  To listen to them, you would
imagine they were perfectly unanimous.  But just throw them a bone; they
will behave exactly like our dogs.<sup><a href="#f036_1">1</a></sup></p>

long-drawn-out note!  There is no such singer in all the rest of our
forest."</p>

<p>"To you, my dear gossip, I could listen for ever."</p>

<p>"And as for you, my beauty, I swear that, when you are silent, I
scarcely know how to wait till you begin again.  Where do you get such a
voice from?&horbar;so clear, so soft, and so high!  But no doubt you
were always like that; not very large in stature, but in song&horbar;a
regular nightingale."</p>

<p>"Thanks, gossip.  As for you, I declare, on my conscience, you sing
better than the birds in the garden of Eden.  For a proof of this, I
appeal to public opinion."</p>

<p>At this moment a Sparrow, which had overheard their conversation,
said to them,</p>

<p>"You may go on praising one another till you are hoarse, my friends;
but your music is utterly worthless."</p>

<h2 id="f038">THE PEASANTS AND THE RIVER.</h2>

<p>SOME Peasants, who had been driven out of all patience by the ruin
which the brooks and rivulets had brought upon them by their
overflowing, set out to seek redress from the River into which those
streams fell.  And, indeed, there was much reason for denouncing them.
They had torn away the seed from the newly-sown fields, they had
over-thrown and washed away mills, and it was impossible to count the
cattle they had drowned.  But the River flows so gently, though indeed
proudly:  on its banks great cities stand, and no one ever hears such
tricks laid to its charge.  So, doubtless, it will put a check upon
these streams.</p>

<p>Thus did the Peasants reason among themselves.  But what happened?
When they had drawn near to the banks of the River, and looked out upon
its surface, they saw that its stream was bearing along half of their
missing property.  The Peasants, without beginning a fruitless
complaint, only gazed on the waters for awhile.  Then, after looking in
each other's faces, and shaking their heads, they returned home; and as
they went, they said,</p>

<p>"Why should we waste our time?  You'll never get any redress for what
the children have stolen, so long as their parents go halves with them
in the spoil."</p>

<p>[The best comment upon this fable is that supplied by Trutofsky's
illustration of it.  A number of peasants have come to lay before the
district Ispravnik, or officer of rural police, a complaint against some
of their petty oppressors.  But, on arriving near the Ispravnik's house,
they see that worthy standing in his verandah, benignantly smiling on
the two men they have come to complain of, who are offering him a
variety of presents, all of which the peasants recognise as having
formerly belonged to themselves.  Horrified at the sight, they are
evidently about to retire without laying their case before such a
judge.]</p>

<h2 id="f039">THE BAG.</h2>

<p>AN empty Bag long lay neglected on the ground, in the corner of an
antechamber, the lowest menials of the house often using it as a mat to
rub their shoes upon.  But suddenly our Bag was turned to honourable
account, and filled full of ducats.  In an iron-bound coffer it now lies
in security.  Its master caresses it with his own hand, and takes such
care of it that not a breath of wind is able to ruffle it; no fly dares
to light upon it.  Besides this, the whole town becomes well acquainted
with the Bag.  If a friend comes to visit its master, he willingly
begins to say pleasant things about the Bag.  Whenever it is opened,
every one smiles sweetly upon it; and whoever sits down by its side is
sure to pat it or stroke it affectionately, seeing that it is
universally respected.  The Bag begins to be puffed up, to make much of
itself, to air its cleverness.  It begins to chatter and to give
utterance to nonsense, discussing and criticising everything:  "This is
not so," and "That man is a fool," or "That affair will turn out badly".
Every one gives it his entire attention, listening with open mouth,
although it talks nonsense enough to make their ears tingle.  But,
unfortunately, men have this weakness, that they are sure to admire
whatever a Bag says, so long as it is full of ducats.</p>

<p>But did the Bag long enjoy honour?&horbar;did its reputation for
cleverness last, and was it long the object of endearment?  Only until
its last ducat had been taken out of it:  then it was flung out of
doors, and nothing more was ever heard of it.</p>

<p>[To this Bag Krilof compares many of the wealthy brandy-tax
farmers.<sup><a href="#f039_1">1</a></sup> Some of them, he says, were
once mere waiters in petty taverns, but have now grown rich, and assumed
airs of importance.  "A million is a great fact.  Only, friends, don't
be too proud.  Shall I whisper the truth to you?  God grant you may not
get ruined!  For, if you do, the same fate will befall you that befell

<h2 id="f040">FORTUNE AND THE BEGGAR.</h2>

<p>A WRETCHED Beggar, carrying a ragged old wallet, was creeping along
from house to house; and, as he grumbled at his lot, he kept wondering
that folks who lived in rich apartments, and were up to their throats in
money and in the sweets of indulgence, should be always unsatisfied,
however full their pockets might be, and that they should go so far as
often to lose all they have, while unreasonably craving for, and laying
their hands on, new riches.  "Here, for instance," he says, "the former
master of this house succeeded in trading prosperously, and made himself
enormously rich by commerce.  But then, instead of stopping, and handing
over his business to another, and spending the rest of his years in
peace, he took to equipping ships for the sea in the spring.  He
expected to get mountains of gold; but the ships were smashed, and his
treasures were swallowed up by the waves.  Now they all lie at the
bottom of the sea, and he has found his riches melt away like those in
dreams.  Another man became one of the farmers of the spirit-tax, and so
gained a million.  That was a trifle:  he wanted to double it.  So he
plunged up to his ears in speculations, and was utterly ruined.  In
short, instances of this are countless.  And quite right too:  a man
should use discretion."</p>

<p>At this moment Fortune suddenly appeared to the Beggar, and said,
"Listen!  I have long wished to help you.  Here is a lot of ducats I
have found.  Hold out your wallet, and I will fill it with them; but
only on this condition:&horbar;All shall be gold that falls into the
wallet; but if any of it falls out of the wallet to the ground, it shall
all become dust.  Consider this well.  I have warned you beforehand.  I
shall keep strictly to my compact.  Your wallet is old; don't overload
it beyond its powers."</p>

<p>Our Beggar is almost too overjoyed to breathe.  He scarcely feels the
ground beneath his feet.  He opens his wallet, and with generous hand a
golden stream of ducats is poured into it.  The wallet soon becomes
rather heavy.</p>

<p>"Is that enough?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Isn't it cracking?"</p>

<p>"Never fear."</p>

<p>"Consider, you're quite a Cr&oelig;sus."</p>

<p>"Just a little more; just add a handful."</p>

<p>"There, it's full.  Take care:  the wallet is going to burst."</p>

<p>"Just a little bit more."</p>

<p>But at that moment the wallet split; the treasure fell through, and
turned to dust; and Fortune disappeared.  The Beggar had nothing but his
empty wallet, and remained as poor as before.</p>

<h2 id="f041">THE CUCKOO AND THE EAGLE.</h2>

<p>THE Eagle promoted a Cuckoo to the rank of a Nightingale.  The
Cuckoo, proud of its new position, seated itself proudly on an aspen,
and began to exhibit its musical talents.  After a time, it looks round.
All the birds are flying away, some laughing at it, others abusing it.
Cuckoo grows angry, and hastens to the Eagle with a complaint against
the birds,</p>

<p>"Have pity on me!" it says.  "According to your command, I have been
appointed Nightingale to these woods, and yet the birds dare to laugh at
my singing."</p>

<p>"My friend," answers the Eagle, "I am a king, but I am not God.  It
is impossible for me to remedy the cause of your complaint.  I can order
a Cuckoo to be styled a Nightingale; but to make a Nightingale out of a
Cuckoo&horbar;that I cannot do."</p>

<h2 id="f042">THE ASS.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT had an Ass which seemed to behave itself so discreetly that
he could not praise it too highly.  But, in order that it might not get
lost in the forest, our peasant tied a bell round its neck.  On this our
Ass, who had evidently heard a great deal of talk about decorations,
became puffed up, began to grow proud and conceited, and looked upon
itself as a very important gentleman.  But its new rank proved ruinous
to the Ass, poor thing!&horbar;a fact which may serve as a lesson for
others besides asses.  I ought to tell you beforehand that the Ass was
never over-honest; but until it got its bell everything went smoothly
with it.  If it made its way into a field of rye or oats, or into a
garden, it ate what it wanted, and then got out again quietly.  But now
it is a very different story with him.  Whenever our illustrious
gentleman trespasses, the bell which now adorns his neck goes with him,
and rings an incessant peal.  Everyone looks out to see what it is.
Here, one man, seizing a bludgeon, drives our poor beast out of his
rye-field or his garden; and there, another, who owns a field of oats,
no sooner hears the sound of the bell, than he catches up a stake, and
begins thrashing the unfortunate animal's flanks.  So that by the autumn
our poor grandee is half dead:  the Ass has nothing left but skin and
bone.<sup><a href="#f042_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In the same way among men, also, rank proves injurious to rogues.  As
long as a rogue's position is humble, he is not remarked.  But a lofty
rank is, to a rogue, as it were a bell round his neck.  Its noise is
loud, and may be heard afar off.</p>

<h2 id="f043">THE LANDLORD AND THE MICE.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN Merchant built a magazine, in which he stored away his
stock of edibles; and, in order that the mice should not damage them, he
instituted a police of cats.  And now the Merchant lives in peace.  His
stores are patrolled day and night, and all goes well.  Unfortunately,
an unexpected contingency occurs.  One of the guardians proves himself a
thief.  Among cats, as with us (who knows it not?), the police are not
faultless.  But then, instead of detecting and punishing the thief, and
sparing the honest servant, our landlord orders all his cats to be
whipped.  As soon as they hear this ingenious sentence, honest and
guilty alike, they all run out of the house as quickly as possible:  our
landlord remains catless.  This is just what the mice have been hoping
and longing for.  They enter the stores as soon as the cats have left,
and in two or three weeks they contrive to eat up the whole of their
contents.</p>

<p>[This fable, printed in 1811, probably alludes to the consequences of
the wholesale punishment inflicted on the officials of the Commissariat
and Victualling Departments during the war with France.  They were
disgraced in a body, and their uniforms were taken from them.  The
result was, that numbers of them retired from the service, rather than
put up with such a slight.  Krilof was interested in the matter; for the
sister of one of his best friends was married to the
General-Provision-Master.]</p>

<h2 id="f044">THE PEASANT AND THE SHEEP.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT summoned a Sheep into court, charging the poor thing with a
criminal offence.  The judge was&horbar;the Fox.  The case got into full
swing immediately.  Plaintiff and defendant were equally adjured to
state, point by point, and without both speaking at once, how the affair
took place, and in what their proofs consisted.</p>

<p>Says the Peasant:  "On such and such a day, I missed two of my fowls
early in the morning.  Nothing was left of them but bones and feathers.
And no one had been in the yard but the Sheep."  Then the Sheep depones
that it was fast asleep all the night in question; and it calls all its
neighbours to testify that they had never known it guilty either of
theft or of any roguery; and, besides this, it states that it never
touches flesh-meat.</p>

<p>Here is the Fox's decision, word for word:</p>

<p>"The explanation of the Sheep cannot under any circumstances be
accepted.  For all rogues are notoriously clever at concealing their
real designs; and it appears manifest, on due inquiry, that on the
aforesaid night the Sheep was not separated from the fowls; and fowls
are exceedingly savoury, and opportunity favoured it.  Therefore I
decide, according to my conscience, that it is impossible that the Sheep
could have forborne to eat the fowls; and accordingly the Sheep shall be
put to death, and its carcase shall be given to the court, and its
fleece shall be taken by the plaintiff."</p>

<h2 id="f045">THE RAZORS.</h2>

<p>AS I was travelling, one day, I fell in with an acquaintance, and we
spent the night in the same bed-room.  As soon as I awake next morning,
what do I hear?  My friend is evidently in trouble.  The night before,
we had both gone to bed merry and free from care; but now my friend is
entirely changed:  he groans, he sighs, he mutters words of
complaining.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my friend?"  I cry.  "You're not ill, I
hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replies; "but I'm shaving."</p>

<p>"What! is that all?"  I exclaim; and thereupon I get up and look at
him.  The strange fellow is making faces at himself in the
looking-glass, with tears in his eyes, and looking as agonized all the
time as if he were expecting to be flayed alive.  When I had at last
discovered the cause of such sufferings, I say to him, "It's no wonder,
and it's entirely your own fault that you are so much hurt.  Just look
at those things of yours.  They are more like carving-knives than
razors:  as to shaving with them, that is impossible.  All you can do is
to scrape yourself painfully with them."</p>

<p>"I must allow, brother," he replies, "that the razors are excessively
blunt; how can I help knowing that?  I'm not such a fool as all that.
But I never use sharp ones, for fear of cutting myself."</p>

<p>"But I venture to assure you, my friend, that you will cut yourself
much sooner with a blunt razor.  With a sharp one you will shave
yourself twice as safely; only you must know how to use it
properly."</p>

afraid of clever people, and are more ready to have fools about
them?</p>

<h2 id="f046">THE MONKEY AND THE MIRROR.</h2>

<p>A MONKEY, which saw its image one day in a mirror, gave a Bear a
slight push with its foot, and said, "Only look, my dear gossip, what a
hideous creature that is!  What grimaces it makes!  How it skips about!
I should hang myself from vexation if I were at all like that.  But, if
we must tell the truth, are there not in the number of our friends five
or six such grimacers?"</p>

<p>"Why take the trouble to count up your friends?  Would it not be
better to take a look at yourself?" answered the Bear.</p>

<p>But Mishka's advice was only thrown away uselessly.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples of this in the world.  No one is ready
to recognise himself in a satire.  I remarked that only yesterday.  We
all know that Clement's hands are not clean.  Every one charges Clement
with taking bribes; but he shakes his head with secret horror when he

<h2 id="f047">THE ELEPHANT IN FAVOUR.</h2>

<p>ONCE upon a time, the Elephant stood high in the good graces of the
Lion.  The forest immediately began to talk about the matter, and, as
usual, many guesses were made as to the means by which the Elephant had
gained such favour.</p>

<p>"It is no beauty," say the beasts to each other, "and it is not
amusing.  And what habits it has! what manners!"</p>

<p>Says the Fox, whisking about his brush, "If it had possessed such a
bushy tail as mine, I should not have wondered."</p>

<p>"Or, sister," says the Bear, "if it had got into favour on account of
claws, no one would have found the matter at all extraordinary; but it
has no claws at all, as we all know well."</p>

<p>"Isn't it its tusks that have got it into favour?" thus the Ox broke
in upon their conversation.  "Haven't they, perhaps, been mistaken for
horns?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said the Ass, shaking its ears, "that you don't
know how it has succeeded in making itself liked, and in becoming
distinguished?  Why, I have guessed the reason.  If it hadn't been
distinguished for its long ears, it never would have got into
favour."</p>

<h2 id="f048">THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE.</h2>

<p>A GRISLY Wolf carried off a sheep from the fold into a retired nook
in the forest&horbar;not from hospitality, one may well suppose.  The
glutton tore the skin off the poor sheep, and began devouring it so
greedily that the bones cracked under its teeth.  But, in spite of its
rapacity, it could not eat it all up; so it set aside what remained over
for supper, and then, lying down close by it, cuddled itself together at
its ease, after the succulent repast.</p>

<p>But, see, the smell of the banquet has attracted its near neighbour,
a young Mouse.  Between the mossy tufts and hillocks it has crept, has
seized a morsel of meat, and has run off quickly to its home in a hollow
tree.  Perceiving the theft, our Wolf begins to howl through the forest,
crying, "Police!  Robbery!  Stop thief!  I'm ruined!  I've been robbed
of everything I possessed!"</p>

<p>Just such an occurrence did I witness in the town.  A thief stole a
watch from Clement, the judge, and the judge shouted after the thief,
"Police, police!"</p>

<h2 id="f049">THE PEASANT IN TROUBLE.</h2>

<p>A THIEF crept into a Peasant's house one autumn night, and, betaking
himself to the store-room,<sup><a href="#f049_1">1</a></sup> rummaged
the walls, the shelves, and the ceiling, and stole, without remorse, all
he could lay his hands on.  So that our Moujik, poor fellow, who had
lain down a rich man, woke up so bereft of everything, that a beggar's
sack seemed the only resource left him in the world.  Heaven grant that
none of us may ever know a similar waking!  The Peasant weeps and wails,
and calls together his friends and relatives, his gossips, and all his
neighbours.</p>

<p>"Can't you help me in my trouble?" he asks.</p>

<p>Then each begins to address the Peasant, and favours him with sage
advice.</p>

<p>Says his gossip Karpich, "Ah, my light! you shouldn't have gone
boasting to all the world that you were so rich."</p>

<p>Says his gossip Klimich, "In future, my dear gossip, you must take
care to have the store-room close to the room you sleep in."</p>

<p>"Ah, brothers, you're all in the wrong," exclaims his neighbour
Phocas.  "The fault wasn't in the store-room being at a distance.  What
you must do is to keep some fierce dogs in your yard.  Take whichever
you please of my Jouchka's puppies.  I would far rather cordially make a
present of them to a good neighbour than drown them."</p>

<p>And thus, as far as words went, his loving friends and relatives gave
him a thousand excellent pieces of advice, each according to his power;
but when it came to deeds, not one of them would help the poor
fellow.</p>

<p>THE keen blade of a Sword, made of Damascus steel, which had been
thrown aside on a heap of old iron, was sent to market with the other
pieces of metal, and sold for a trifle to a Moujik.  Now, a Moujik's
ideas move in a narrow circle.  He immediately set to work to turn the
blade to account.  Our Moujik fitted a handle to the blade, and began to
strip with it lime trees, in the forest, of the bark he wanted for
shoes, while at home he unceremoniously splintered fir chips with it.
Sometimes, also, he would lop off twigs with it, or small branches for
mending his wattled fences, or would shape stakes with it for his garden
paling.  And the result was that, before the year was out, our blade was
notched and rusted from one end to the other, and the children used to
ride astride of it.  So one day a Hedgehog, which was lying under a
bench in the cottage, close by the spot where the blade had been flung,
said to it,</p>

<p>"Tell me, what do you think of this life of yours?  If there is any
truth in all the fine things that are said about Damascus steel, you
surely must be ashamed of having to splinter fir chips, and square
stakes, and of being turned, at last, into a plaything for
children."</p>

<p>But the Sword-blade replied,</p>

<p>"In the hands of a warrior, I should have been a terror to the foe;
but here my special faculties are of no avail.  So in this house I am
turned to base uses only.  But am I free to choose my employment?  No!
Not I, but he, ought to be ashamed, who could not see for what I was fit
to be employed."</p>

its generosity in the hearing of a neighbouring Mountain.  But the
Mountain replied,</p>

<p>"What good have you done by such generosity? and how can one help
being pained at seeing it?  If you had poured your showers over the
land, you would have saved a whole district from famine.  But as to the
sea, my friend, it has plenty of water already, without you adding to

could be seen from thence.  Here flowed rivers, winding across the
plains; there stood woods and meadows, adorned with the full garb of
spring; and, beyond, frowned the angry Caspian Sea, black as a raven's
wing.</p>

<p>"Praise be to thee, O Jove, that, as ruler of the world, thou hast
bestowed on me such powers of flight that I know of no heights to me

strongest of wing there are some who would not dare to trust themselves
here.  But you, weak and wingless, is it possible you can have crawled

drinking at an ice-hole, not far from the haunts of men.  Meanwhile,
whether by pure accident or from negligence doesn't much matter, the end
of its tail got wet, and froze to the ice.  No great harm was done; the
Fox could easily remedy it.  It had only to give a tolerably hard pull,
and leave about a score of its hairs behind; then it could run away home
quickly, before any one came.  But how could it make up its mind to
spoil its tail?  Such a bushy tail as it was, so ample and golden!  No;
better wait a little.  Surely, men are sleeping still.  It's even
possible that a thaw may, meanwhile, set in.  In that case, it will be
able to withdraw its tail easily from the ice-hole.  So it waits:  it
goes on waiting, but its tail only freezes all the more.  It looks
round; the day is already beginning to dawn.  People are stirring;
voices are to be heard.  Our poor Fox begins to rush about
wildly&horbar;now this way, now that.  But still it cannot free itself
from the hole.  Luckily, a Wolf comes running that way.</p>

<p>"Dear friend, gossip, father!" cries the Fox, "do save me&horbar;I am

<p>So the Wolf stopped, and set to work to rescue the Fox.  Its method

made it publicly known among the people, that in future he meant to give
away food to the needy every Saturday.  And, indeed, any one who passed
his house, at the end of the week, could see that his gates were not
closed.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" they think, "he will be utterly ruined."  But of that
there was no fear; for, every Saturday, he unchained a number of
ferocious dogs, so that it was not a question with the poor who visited
him of eating or of drinking, but simply of escaping, if Heaven willed
it, with a whole skin.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Miron was looked upon as almost a saint.  Every one
said, "One can't sufficiently admire Miron; only it's a pity that he
keeps such savage dogs, and that it's so difficult to get at him:
otherwise, he is ready to give away all he has, even to the uttermost
copeck."</p>

<p>It has often occurred to me to see how hard of access are the palaces
of great people.  But, of course, the fault is not due to the Mirons.
It is always the dogs who are to blame.</p>

<h2 id="f058">THE WOLF AND THE FOX.</h2>

<p>A FOX, which had feasted on fowls to satiety, and had set aside a
good store of spare food, lay down under a haycock, one evening, to
sleep.  Suddenly it looks up, and sees a hungry Wolf dragging itself
along to pay it a visit.</p>

<p>"This is terrible, gossip!" says the Wolf.  "I cannot anywhere find
even the smallest of bones to pick, and I am actually dying of hunger.
The dogs are malicious, the shepherd won't sleep, and I have nothing
left but to hang myself."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Really and truly."</p>

<p>"My poor old gossip!  But won't you take a little hay?  There is a
whole haycock.  I am delighted to oblige my friend."</p>

<p>But what its friend wanted was meat, not hay; and about its stock of
provisions the Fox said never a word.  So my grey-coated hero, though
greatly caressed as to its ears by its gossip, had to go to bed
supperless.</p>

<h2 id="f059">THE OWL AND THE ASS.</h2>

<p>A BLIND Ass, which had undertaken a long journey, wandered from the
road into a forest.  As the night came on, our foolish fellow went so
far into the thicket that it couldn't move either backwards or forwards;
and even one who had eyes would have been unable to get out of that
difficulty.  But an Owl, by good luck, happened to be in the
neighbourhood, and offered to act as a guide to the Ass.  We all know
how well Owls see at night.  Hills, hillocks, ditches,
precipices&horbar;all these our Owl distinguished as if it had been
daylight, and, by daybreak, it had made its way with the Ass to the
level road.  Now, how could any one part with such a guide?  So the Ass
entreated the Owl not to desert it, and determined to visit the whole
world in the Owl's company.  Our Owl seated itself like a lord on the
back of the Ass, and the two friends began to continue their journey.
But did it prosper?  No.  The sun had scarcely begun to glow in the
morning sky, when a greater than nocturnal darkness hid everything from
the Owl's eyes.  But our Owl is obstinate:  it directs the Ass at
random.</p>

<p>"Take care!" it cries.  "We shall tumble into a pool, if we go to the
right."</p>

<p>There was really no pool on the right; but on the left there was even
worse.</p>

<p>"Keep more to the left&horbar;another pace to the left!"
And&horbar;the Owl and the Ass fell into the ravine together.</p>

<h2 id="f060">THE MONKEY AND THE SPECTACLES.</h2>

<p>A MONKEY became weak-sighted in old age.  Now it had heard men say
that this misfortune was one of no great importance; only one must
provide oneself with glasses.  So it gets half-a-dozen pairs of
spectacles, turns them now this way and now that, puts them on the top
of its head, applies them to its tail, smells them, licks them; still
the spectacles have no effect at all on its sight.</p>

<p>"Good lack!" it cries, "what fools they be who listen to all the
nonsense men utter!  They've told me nothing but lies about the
spectacles.  There isn't an atom of good in them."</p>

<p>Here the Monkey, in its vexation and annoyance, flung them down on a
stone so violently that they were utterly broken to bits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, men behave in the same way.  However useful a thing
may be, an ignorant man, who knows nothing about its value, is sure to
speak ill of it, and, if he possesses any influence, he persecutes it
too.</p>

<h2 id="f061">THE ELEPHANT AND THE PUG-DOG.</h2>

<p>AN Elephant was being taken through the streets, probably as a sight.
It is well known that Elephants are a wonder among us; so crowds of
gaping idlers followed the Elephant.  From some corner or other, a
Pug-dog comes to meet him.  It looks at the Elephant, and then begins to
run at it, to bark, to squeal, to try to get at it, just as if it wanted
to fight it.</p>

<p>"Neighbour, cease to bring shame on yourself," says Shafka<sup><a
href="#f061_1">1</a></sup> to it.  "Are you capable of fighting an
Elephant?  Just see now, you are already hoarse; but it keeps straight
on, and does not pay you the slightest attention."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" replies the Pug-dog, "that's just what gives me courage.
In this way, you see, without fighting at all, I may get reckoned among
the greatest bullies.  Just let the dogs say, 'Ah, look at Puggy!  He
must be strong, indeed, that's clear, or he would never bark at an
Elephant.'"</p>

<h2 id="f062">THE INDUSTRIOUS BEAR.</h2>

<p>SEEING that a Peasant, who employed himself in making dugas,<sup><a
href="#f062_1">1</a></sup> disposed of them advantageously, a Bear
determined to gain its living by the same business.  The forest
resounded with knocking and cracking, and the noise of the Bear's pranks
could be heard a verst off.  It destroyed a prodigious number of elms,
birches, and hazels; but its labours did not lead to a good result.
(For dugas are bent by dint of patience, and not in a moment.)  So our
Bear goes to the Peasant, and asks his advice, saying,</p>

<p>"Neighbour, what is the reason of this?  I can break trees; but I
haven't been able to bend one into a duga.  Tell me, in what does the
real secret of success consist?"</p>

<p>"In that," answered the Peasant, "of which, my friend, you haven't a
bit&horbar;in patience."</p>

<p><sup id="f062_1">1</sup> The <i>duga</i> is the wooden arch which, in
a Russian cart or carriage, rises from the shafts above the horse's
neck.  When gaily painted and provided with bells, it is supposed to
appeal to the animal's &aelig;sthetic tastes, and to encourage it to go
on its way rejoicing.  There are factories now in which <i>dugas</i> are
made wholesale by steam-power.</p>

<h2 id="f063">THE FOX AS ARCHITECT.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN Lion was exceedingly fond of fowls, but they never throve
with him.  And that was no wonder.  They lived utterly free from all
restrictions; and so some of them were stolen, others disappeared of
their own accord.</p>

<p>To remedy this unpleasantness and loss, the Lion determined to build
a large poultry-yard, and so cunningly to design and arrange it, as
entirely to keep out thieves, but to provide the fowls with plenty of
space and all things needful.</p>

<p>Well, they inform the Lion that the Fox is a great hand at building,
so the affair is entrusted to him.  The building is begun and ended
successfully, the Fox working at it with all conceivable industry and
talent.  The building is looked at and examined in detail.  Truly, it is
a work which cannot be too much admired.  Everything is there which any
one can possibly desire&horbar;food close at hand, perches inserted
everywhere, refuges from cold and heat, and retired little places for
the sitting hens.  All honour and glory to our good Fox!  A liberal
reward is bestowed on him, and an order is given to transfer the fowls,
without loss of time, to their new abode.</p>

<p>But is the change of any use?  Not at all.  It is true that the
building seems firm and massive, and the walls enclosing it lofty.  But
yet the fowls daily become fewer and fewer.  No one can imagine whence
this evil springs.  But the Lion orders a watch to be set; and whom do
they catch?  Why that villain, the Fox.  It is true that he had
constructed the building so that no one else could break in and steal;
but he had taken care to leave a little hole by which he could get into
it himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f064">FORTUNE'S VISIT.</h2>

<p>AT the extremity of a town stood a wretched old house.  In it lived
three brothers, who could not get rich.  Somehow, there was not a single
thing that succeeded with them.  Whatever any one of them took in hand
was sure to prove unsuccessful:  on all sides they met with hindrance
and loss; and, according to them, it was all the fault of Fortune.</p>

<p>It happened that Fortune paid them a visit as she was passing by,
and, touched by their great poverty, determined to do all she could to
help them in everything they undertook, and to spend a whole summer with
them.  A whole summer!&horbar;a long time indeed.  Well, the poor
fellows soon find their affairs assuming a different aspect.  One of
them, although he was a poor hand at trading, gets a great profit now on
everything he either buys or sells, utterly forgets that such a thing as
loss exists, and rapidly becomes as rich as Cr&oelig;sus.  The second
enters the public service.  At another time he would have stuck fast
among the copyists; but now he reaps successes on all sides.  Every time
he gives a dinner, or pays a visit of ceremony, he gets either rank
conferred upon him or a place given him.  See, he has an estate, a
mansion in town:  and a box in the country.</p>

<p>And now you will ask, what advantage did the third brother obtain?  I
suppose that Fortune really helped him also?  Certainly; from his side
she scarcely ever absented herself.  The third brother chased flies all
the summer, and that with the most wonderful success.  I don't know
whether he used to be clever at that sort of thing in former days, but
during that summer his labour was never thrown away.  In whatever manner
he moved his hand (thanks to Fortune), he never once missed his
shot.</p>

<p>But see! their guest, meanwhile, has brought her stay with the
brothers to an end, and has set out on a long journey.  Two of the
brothers have gained greatly.  One of them is rich; the other has got
riches and rank besides.  But the third brother curses his fate,
inasmuch as malignant Fortune has left him nothing but a beggar's
wallet.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f065">THE LION, THE CHAMOIS, AND THE FOX.</h2>

<p>A LION was chasing a Chamois along a valley.  He had all but caught
it, and with longing eyes was anticipating a certain and a satisfying
repast.  It seemed as if it were utterly impossible for the victim to
escape; for a deep ravine appeared to bar the way for both the hunter
and the hunted.  But the nimble Chamois, gathering together all its
strength, shot like an arrow from a bow across the chasm, and stood
still on the rocky cliff on the other side.  Our Lion pulled up short.
But at that moment a friend of his happened to be near at hand.  That
friend was the Fox.  "What!" said he, "with your strength and agility,
is it possible that you will yield to a feeble Chamois?  You have only
to will, and you will be able to work wonders.  Though the abyss be
deep, yet, if you are only in earnest, I am certain you will clear it.
Surely you can confide in my disinterested friendship.  I would not
expose your life to danger if I were not so well aware of your strength
and dexterity."</p>

<p>The Lion's blood waxed hot, and began to boil in his veins.  He flung
himself with all his might into space.  But he could not clear the
chasm; so down he tumbled headlong, and was killed by the fall.  Then
what did his dear friend do?  He cautiously made his way down to the
bottom of the ravine, and there, out in the open space and the free air,
seeing that the Lion wanted neither flattery nor obedience now, he set
to work to pay the last sad rites to his dead friend, and in a month
picked his bones clean.</p>

<h2 id="f066">THE ORACLE.</h2>

<p>IN a certain temple there was a wooden idol which began to utter
prophetic answers, and to give wise counsels.  Accordingly, it rejoiced
in a very rich attire, being covered from top to toe with gold and
silver; and was gorged with sacrifices, deafened by prayers, and choked
with incense.  Every one believed blindly in the Oracle.</p>

<p>All of a sudden&horbar;wonderful to relate!&horbar;the Oracle began
to talk nonsense&horbar;took to answering incoherently and absurdly, so
that, if any one consulted it about anything, whatever our Oracle said
was a lie; so that every one wondered what had become of its prophetic
faculty.  The fact was, that the idol was hollow, and the priests used
to sit in it in order to reply to the laity; and so, as long as that
priest was discreet, the idol did not talk nonsense; but when a fool
took to sitting in it, the idol became a mere dummy.<sup><a
href="#f066_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I have heard&horbar;can it be true?&horbar;that in days gone by there
used to be judges who were renowned for ability&horbar;so long as they
kept an able secretary.</p>

<h2 id="f067">THE ASS AND THE PEASANT.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT, who had hired an Ass for his garden during the summer, set
it to drive away the impudent race of crows and of sparrows.  The Ass
was one of a most honest character, utterly unacquainted with either
rapacity or theft.  It never profited by a single leaf belonging to its
master, and it would indeed be a sin to say that it connived at the
proceedings of the birds.  Still the Peasant got but little good out of
his garden.  The Ass, as it chased the birds with all its might,
galloped across all the beds, backwards and forwards, in such a manner
that it trod underfoot and trampled in pieces everything that grew in
the garden.</p>

<p>Seeing then that all his pains were thrown away, the Peasant took a
cudgel and revenged himself for his loss on the back of the Ass.  "No
wonder!" says every one; "serve the beast right!  Was it for a creature
of its parts to undertake such a business?"</p>

<p>But I say&horbar;though not with the intention of defending the Ass;
it was certainly in fault, and it has already paid the
penalty&horbar;surely he also was to blame who set the Ass to guard his
garden.</p>

<h2 id="f068">THE SHEEP AND THE DOGS.</h2>

<p>IN a certain flock of Sheep, it was resolved that the number of dogs
should be increased, in order that the wolves might worry no more.  What
was the result?  Why, the number increased so greatly that at last,
truly enough, the Sheep were no longer annoyed by the wolves.  But dogs,
too, must live.  So, first, they deprived the Sheep of their fleeces,
and then they tore their skins off them, choosing them by lot.  At last,
only five or six of the Sheep remained, and those also the dogs ate
up.</p>

<p>[In former days, whenever there was a difficulty about setting
straight anything that had gone wrong in Russia, the only idea which
suggested itself to the minds of the authorities was to increase the
number of those officials who had to deal with the matter.  But as these
officials were miserably paid, they had to make a livelihood out of the
people who were confided to their charge, and who, accordingly, fared no
better than the sheep in the fable.  Latterly, a different system has
been introduced, and fewer but better paid officials are now
employed.]</p>

<h2 id="f069">THE STRING OF CARTS.</h2>

<p>A NUMBER of Carts, laden with pottery, were going along in a string,
and had to descend a steep hill.  Having left the others to wait a
little on the top of the hill, the owner began very cautiously to lead
down the first cart.  The good horse which drew it almost supported the
weight on its croup, not allowing it to roll down too fast.  But a young
Horse up on top took to blaming the poor animal for every step it
made:</p>

<p>"Ah, praiseworthy animal! how wonderful!  Just see, it crawls like a
crab.  See there, it has almost stumbled over a stone!  Look how awry,
how askew, are its movements!  Ah! it's bolder now.  There's a jostle
again!  Only here you ought to have gone a little more to the left.  Oh,
what a donkey!  It would be all very well if this were night, or if it
were going uphill.  But now it is going downhill, and by daylight.  One
loses all patience while watching it.  Really it's a water-carrier you
ought to be, if you have no sense in you.  But just look at
us!&horbar;see how we will dash along.  Never fear for us; we won't lose
a moment:  we shall not so much carry our loads as whirl them down."</p>

<p>With these words, straining its back and inflating its chest, the
young Horse sets its load in motion.  But no sooner does it commence the
descent than the weight begins to press upon it heavily, the Cart to
roll rapidly.  The Horse, urged on from behind, and thrust from side to
side, dashes on splendidly at a gallop.  Over stones, across gullies,
went the Cart amid shocks and boundings.  More to the left&horbar;still
to the left, till at last the Cart and its load goes headlong into the
ditch with a crash!  Farewell to the master's crockery.</p>

<p>[This fable alludes to the criticisms evoked by Kutuzof's
unwillingness to precipitate matters in dealing with Napoleon.  When he
refused to fight under the walls of Moscow, the people began to clamour
against him, as they had done against Barclay de Tolly; and the younger
officers under his command were especially indignant with him.  But

<h2 id="f070">THE DIVERS.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN King, says Krilof,<sup><a href="#f070_1">1</a></sup> could
not make up his mind as to whether knowledge and science produce more
good or harm.  He consulted divers learned men on the subject, but they
could not solve the problem to his satisfaction.  At last, one day, he
met a venerable and remarkably intelligent hermit, to whom he confided
his doubts, and who favoured him with the following apologue:</p>

<p>"There was once a fisherman, in India, who lived on the sea-coast.
After a long life of poverty and privation, he died, leaving three sons.
They, seeing that their nets brought them in but a scanty livelihood,
and detesting their father's avocation, determined to make the sea yield
them a richer recompense&horbar;not fish, but pearls.  So, as they knew
how to swim and to dive, they gave themselves up to collecting that form
of tribute from it.  But the three brothers met with very different
kinds of success.</p>

<p>"The first, the laziest of the family, spent his time in sauntering
along the shore.  He had an objection to wetting even so much as his
feet, so he confined his expectations to picking up such pearls as the
waves might wash ashore at his feet.  But the result of this laziness of
his was that he scarcely made enough to keep him alive.  As to the
second, he used to dive, and find rich pearls at the bottom of the sea,
never sparing any pains, and knowing how to choose those depths only
which it lay within his power to sound.</p>

<p>"But the third brother, troubled by a craving after vast treasures,
reasoned with himself as follows:  It is true that there are pearls
which one can find near the shore; but what treasures, apparently, might
I not expect if I could only succeed in reaching the lowest depths of
the open sea!  There, no doubt, lie heaps of countless
riches&horbar;corals, pearls, and precious stones&horbar;all of which
one might pick up and carry away at will.'"  Captivated by this idea,
the foolish fellow straightway sought the open sea, chose the spot where
the depths seemed blackest, and plunged into the abyss.  But his
recklessness cost him his life; for the deep swallowed him down, and he
never returned to the light of day.</p>

<p>"O King," continued the hermit, "no doubt we recognise in knowledge
the source of many benefits.  But those who seek it in an irreverent
spirit may find in it an abyss in which they may perish, like the diver,
but with this difference, that they may too often involve others in
their own ruin."</p>

<h2 id="f071">THE TRIGAMIST.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN sinner, while his wife was still alive, married two other
women.  As soon as the news of this reached the King, who was a severe
king, and disinclined to permit such scandals, he immediately ordered
the polygamist to be tried for the offence, and ordained that such a
punishment should be discovered for him as would terrify the whole
people, so that no one should in future be capable of attempting so
great a crime.  "But if I see that his punishment is a light one," he
added, "then I will hang all the judges around the judgment-seat."</p>

<p>This pleasantry is disagreeable to the judges.  Fear bathes them in a
cold sweat.  For three whole days they deliberate as to what punishment
can be contrived for the culprit.  Punishments are plentiful; but
experience has proved that none of them will deter people from sinning.
However, at last Heaven inspired them.  The criminal was brought into
court for the announcement of the judicial decision, by which they
unanimously decreed&horbar;</p>

<p>That he should live with all his three wives at once!</p>

<p>At such a decision the people were lost in astonishment, and expected
that the King would hang all the judges.  But, before the fifth day
arrived, the Trigamist had hanged himself.  And the sentence produced
such alarm that since that time no man has committed trigamy in that
country.</p>

misogynical pleasantry of great antiquity; but it is given as a specimen
of Krilof's terse style of story-telling.]</p>

<h2 id="f072">THE CUCKOO AND THE TURTLE-DOVE.</h2>

<p>A CUCKOO sat on a bough, bitterly complaining.  "Why art thou so sad,
dear friend?" sympathisingly cooed the Turtle-dove to her, from a
neighbouring twig.  "Is it because spring has passed away from us, and
love with it; that the sun has sunk lower, and that we are nearer to the
winter?"</p>

<p>"How can I help grieving, unhappy one that I am?" replies the Cuckoo:
"thou shalt thyself be the judge.  This spring my love was a happy one,
and, after a while, I became a mother.  But my offspring utterly refuse
even to recognise me.  Was it such a return that I expected from them?
And how can I help being envious when I see how ducklings crowd around
their mother&horbar;how chickens hasten to the hen when she calls to
them.  Just like an orphan I sit here, utterly alone, and know not what
filial affection means."</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" says the Dove, "I pity you from my heart.  As for me,
though I know such things often occur, I should die outright if my
dovelets did not love me.  But tell me, have you already brought up your
little ones?  When did you find time to build a nest?  I never saw you
doing anything of the kind:  you were always flying and fluttering
about."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" says the Cuckoo.  "Pretty nonsense it would have been
if I had spent such fine days in sitting on a nest!  That would, indeed,
have been the highest pitch of stupidity!  I always laid my eggs in the
nests of other birds."</p>

<p>"Then how can you expect your little ones to care for you?" says the
Turtle-dove.</p>

<p>Fathers and mothers! let this fable read you a lesson.  I have not
written it as an excuse for undutiful children.  Irreverence on their
part, and want of love towards their parents, must always be a great
fault.  But, if they have grown up apart from you, and you have
entrusted their education to hireling hands, have not you yourselves to
blame, if in old age you obtain but little happiness from them?</p>

<h2 id="f073">THE LEAVES AND THE ROOTS.</h2>

<p>ON a beautiful summer day, the Leaves on a tree whispered softly to
the zephyrs; and, as their shadow fell upon the valley, thus did they
speak, vaunting their luxuriant verdure:</p>

<p>"Is it not true that we are the pride of the whole valley?  Is it not
by us that this tree is rendered so bushy and wide-spreading, so stately
and majestic?  What would it be without us?  Yes, indeed; we may praise
ourselves without committing a sin!  Do not we, by our cool shade,
protect the shepherd and the traveller from the heat?  Do not we, by our
beauty, attract the shepherdess to dance here?  From among us, in the
morning and the evening twilight, the nightingale sings; and as to you,
zephyrs, you scarcely ever desert us."</p>

<p>"You might add a word of thanks even to us," answered a feeble voice
from underground.</p>

<p>"Who is it that dares thus audaciously to call us to account?  Who
are you who are talking there?" the Leaves began to lisp, noisily
tossing on the tree.</p>

<p>"We are they," was the reply from down below, "who, burrowing in
darkness here, provide you with nourishment.  Is it possible that you do
not recognise us?  We are the roots of the tree on which you flourish.
Go on rejoicing in your beauty:  only remember there is this difference
between us, that with the new spring a new foliage is born; but, if the
roots perish, neither you nor the tree can survive."</p>

<p>[In the large illustrated edition of the fables, published four years
ago, at St.  Petersburg, this story is accompanied by one of Trutofsky's
spirited drawings, which renders its meaning very clear.  A couple of
gentlemen and a lady, evidently belonging to the proprietor class, are
sitting at their ease in a balcony; and down below, regarded by them
with contemptuous wonder, stand half-a-dozen peasants, their clothes
tattered, their figures emaciated, their faces worn with care.  The
fable was written in 1811, at a time when the question of the

brother; and it is even said that the dogs never bark there, much less
bite.  Tell me, dear friend, would it not be charming to find oneself,
even in a dream, in so peaceful a land as that?  Farewell!  Don't retain
an unpleasant remembrance of me.  There I shall really be able to live
in harmony, in plenty, and in indulgence, and not, as here, have to be
always on guard by day, and be deprived of one's quiet repose at
night."</p>

<p>"A happy journey to you, dear neighbour," says the Cuckoo.  "But,
tell me, do you leave your teeth and your habits behind you, or do you
take them with you?"</p>

<p>"How could I possibly leave them behind me?  What nonsense are you
talking?"</p>

<p>"Then, mark my words! your skin won't remain long on your back
there."</p>

<h2 id="f075">THE IMPIOUS.</h2>

<p>IN the days of old there was a people, to the shame, be it said, of
the nations of the earth, which became so hardened in heart, that it
took up arms against the gods.  Noisily, with countless banners
displayed, the insurgent crowds overrun the plains, some armed with
bows, others with slings.  In order to kindle more fury among the
people, the ringleaders, in the insolence of their hearts, declare that
the tribunal of Heaven is harsh and foolish&horbar;that the gods either
sleep or judge unreasonably&horbar;that the time has come to read them
an unceremonious lesson&horbar;and that, as to the rest, it will not be
difficult to hurl stones at the gods from the nearest hills, and to fill
all Olympus with arrows.</p>

<p>Disquieted by the insolent blasphemies these fools uttered, all
Olympus applied to Jupiter with the prayer that he would avert this
evil.  And even all the heavenly council was of opinion that, in order
to confute the rebels, it would not be amiss to make manifest, at all
events, a little miracle&horbar;a deluge or an earthquake, with thunder
and lightning, or, perhaps, to crush them under a shower of stones.</p>

<p>"Let us wait a little," replied Jupiter; "for if they do not become
quiet, but go on with their foolish violence, not fearing the immortals,
they will be punished by their own deeds."</p>

<p>Then, with a roar, the banded rebels against the gods shot into the
air a mass of arrows, a cloud of stones.  But, laden with innumerable
deaths, inevitable and terrible, their weapons fell back again upon
their own heads.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f076">THE FOX AND THE MARMOT.</h2>

<p>"WHERE are you running so fast, gossip, without ever looking back?" a
Marmot asked a Fox.</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend, my dear gossip, I have had a calumnious accusation
brought against me, and I have been dismissed as an extortioner.  You
know, I was the judge of the poultry-yard.  In that position I lost my
health and my peace of mind.  From the press of business, I never had
time to get a comfortable meal, and at nights I could not sleep soundly.
And now, in return for this, I have incurred the wrath of my employers,
and all on account of a calumny.  Only just think!  Who in the world
shall be without reproach, if calumnies are listened to?  I an
extortioner!  Do they suppose I've gone out of my mind?  Now, I appeal
to you, have you ever seen that I took part in that wickedness?  Think
the matter over; reflect on it well."</p>

<p>"No, gossip, no; but I have often remarked that there was some down
on your muzzle."</p>

<p>Many an official complains that he is forced to spend every rouble he
has; and all the town knows that, originally, he had nothing, and that
he got nothing with his wife.  But see! little by little he builds a
house; he buys an estate.  Now, in what manner can you reconcile his
salary with his expenditure?  Although you can prove nothing against him
legally, yet you will not be committing a sin if you say, "That fellow
has down on his muzzle."</p>

<h2 id="f077">THE PEASANT AND THE ROBBER.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT, who was beginning to stock his little farm, had bought a
cow and a milk-pail at a fair, and was going quietly homewards by a
lonely path through the forest, when he suddenly fell into the hands of
a Robber.  The Robber stripped him as bare as a lime tree.<sup><a
href="#f077_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>"Have mercy!" cried the Peasant.  "I am utterly ruined.  You have
reduced me to beggary.  For a whole year I have worked to buy this dear
little cow.  I could scarcely bear to wait for this day to arrive."</p>

<p>"Very good," replied the Robber, touched by compassion; "don't cry
out against me.  After all, I shall not want to milk your cow, so I'll
give you back your milk-pail."</p>

<p><sup id="f077_1">1</sup> <i>i.e.</i>, Bare as a lime tree after it
has been stripped of its bark, of which the peasants make shoes,
baskets, &amp;c.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f078">THE ANT.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN Ant had extraordinary strength, such as had never been
heard of even in the days of old.  It could even, as its trustworthy
historian states, lift up two large grains of barley at once!  Besides
this, it was also remarkable for wonderful courage.  Whenever it saw a
worm, it immediately stuck its claws into it, and it would even go alone
against a spider.  And so it acquired such a reputation on its ant-hill,
that it became the sole subject of conversation.</p>

<p>Extravagant praise I consider poison; but our ant was not of the same
opinion:  it delighted in it, measured it by its own conceit, and
believed the whole of it.  At length its head became so turned that it
determined to exhibit itself to the neighbouring city, that it might
acquire fame by showing off its strength there.</p>

<p>Perched on the top of a lofty cart-load of hay, having proudly made
its way to the side of the moujik in charge, it enters the city in great
state.  But, alas! what a blow to its pride!  It had imagined that the
whole bazaar would run together to see it, as to a fire.  But not a word
is said about it, every one being absorbed in his own business.  Our Ant
seizes a leaf, and jerks it about, tumbles down, leaps up again.  Still
not a soul pays it any attention.  At last, wearied with exerting
itself, and holding itself proudly erect, it says, with vexation, to
Barbos, the mastiff, lying beside its master's cart, "It must be
confessed, mustn't it, that the people of your city have neither eyes
nor brains?  Can it really be true that no one remarks me, although I
have been straining myself here for a whole hour?  And yet I'm sure that
at home I am well known to the whole of the ant-hill."</p>

<p>And so it went back again, utterly crestfallen.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f079">THE SLANDERER AND THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>ON the occasion of some triumphal procession in the realms below, the
Snake and the Slanderer refused to yield each other precedence, and
began a noisy quarrel as to which of the two had the best right to go
first.</p>

<p>Now, in the infernal regions, as is well known, he takes precedence
who has done most harm to his fellow-creatures.  So in this hot and
serious dispute, the Slanderer showed his tongue to the Snake; and the
Snake boastingly talked to the Slanderer about its sting, hissed out
that it was unable to put up with an affront, and strove hard to crawl
past him.  The Slanderer actually found himself being left behind.  But
Beelzebub could not allow this:  he himself took the Slanderer's part,
and drove the Snake back, saying,</p>

<p>"Although I recognise your merit, yet I justly assign precedence to
him.  You are excessively venomous, and dangerous in the extreme to
everything which is near you; your sting is fatal, and you
sting&horbar;which is no small merit&horbar;without provocation.  But
can you wound from afar, like the deadly tongue of the Slanderer, from
whom there is no escape, even though mountains or oceans intervene?  It
is clear, then, that he is more deadly than you; so give place to him,
and in future behave more quietly."</p>

<p>Since that time, Slanderers have been honoured more than Snakes in
hell.</p>

<p>[In the first edition of this fable, which appeared in May, 1814, the
triumphal procession was represented as taking place "on the birthday of
Attila or Nero, or perhaps of Napoleon:  I am afraid of stating which,
for fear of making a mistake.  But, after all, it's no matter.  In
Satan's realm such names are inscribed on a tablet, and great
solemnities are appointed in their honour."</p>

<p>Krilof was "a good hater;" and he certainly did not like
Napoleon.]</p>

<h2 id="f080">THE TWO DOGS.</h2>

<p>BARBOS, the faithful yard-dog, who serves his master zealously,
happens to see his old acquaintance Joujou, the curly lap-dog, seated at
the window on a soft down cushion.  Sidling fondly up to her, like a
child to a parent, he all but weeps with emotion; and there, under the
window, he whines, wags his tail, and bounds about.</p>

<p>"What sort of a life do you lead now, Joujoutka, ever since the
master took you into his mansion?  You remember, no doubt, we used often
to suffer hunger out in the yard.  What is your present service
like?"</p>

<p>"It would be a sin in me to murmur against my good fortune," answers
Joujoutka.  "My master cannot make enough of me.  I live amidst riches
and plenty, and I eat and drink off silver.  I frolic with the master,
and, if I get tired, I take my ease on carpets or on a soft couch.  And
how do you get on?"</p>

<p>"I?" replied Barbos, letting his tail dangle like a whip, and hanging
his head.  "I live as I used to do.  I suffer from cold and hunger; and
here, while guarding my master's house, I have to sleep at the foot of
the wall, and I get drenched in the rain.  And if I bark at the wrong
time, I am whipped.  But how did you, Joujou, who were so small and
weak, get taken into favour, while I jump out of my skin to no purpose?
What is it you do?"</p>

<p>"'What is it you do?'  A pretty question to ask!" replied Joujou,
mockingly.  "I walk upon my hind legs."</p>

<p>[This fable is suspiciously like that by Izmailof, called "The Two
Cats," which, in its turn, was adapted from Florian.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f081">THE STONE AND THE WORM.</h2>

<p>"WHAT a fuss every one is making!  How wanting in manners!" observed,
with respect to a shower, a Stone which lay in a field.  "Have the
kindness to look.  Every one is delighted with it.  They have longed for
it as if it were the best of guests; but what is it that it has done?
It has come for a couple of hours or so&horbar;no more.  But they should
make a few inquiries about me.  Why I have lain here for centuries.
Modest and unassuming, I lie quietly where I am thrown.  And yet I have
never heard from a single person so much as a 'Thank you!'  It is not
without reason that the world gets reviled.  I cannot see a grain of
justice anywhere in it."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" exclaimed a Worm.  "This shower, brief as it has
been, has abundantly watered the fields, which were being rendered
sterile by the drought, and has revived the hopes of the fanner.  But
you contribute nothing to the ground but a useless weight."</p>

<p>Thus many a man will boast of having served the state for forty
years; but as for being useful, he has never been a bit more so than the
Stone.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f082">THE KITE.</h2>

<p>A KITE, which had been allowed to soar to the clouds, called out from
on high to a Butterfly down below in the valley,</p>

<p>"I can assure you that I can scarcely make you out.  Confess now that
you feel envious when you watch my so lofty flight."</p>

<p>"Envious?  No, indeed!  You have no business to think so much of
yourself.  You fly high, it is true; but you are always tied by a
string.  Such a life, my friend, is very far removed from happiness.
But I, though in truth but little exalted, fly wherever I wish.  I
should not like all my life long to have to conduce to some one else's
foolish amusement"</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f083">THE SQUIRREL IN SERVICE.</h2>

<p>A SQUIRREL once served a Lion:  I know not how, or in what capacity.
But this much is certain, that the Squirrel's service found favour in
the Lion's eyes; and to satisfy the Lion is, certainly, no light affair.
In return for this, it was promised a whole waggon-load of nuts.
Promised&horbar;yes; but, meanwhile, time continues to fly by.  Our
Squirrel often suffers hunger, and has tears in its eyes while grinning
in the Lion's presence.  When it looks round in the forest, its former
comrades show themselves here and there high up among the trees.  It
looks at them till its eyes begin to blink; but they keep on always
cracking nuts.  Our Squirrel takes a step towards the nut-bushes, looks
at them&horbar;it can do no more.  At one time it is called away, at
another it is even dragged off, on the Lion's service.</p>

<p>But see!  At last the Squirrel has grown old, and become tedious to
the Lion.  It is time for it to retire.  They have granted the Squirrel
its discharge, and they have actually given it the full load of nuts.
Excellent nuts&horbar;such as the world has never seen before.  All
picked fruit&horbar;one as good as another; a perfect marvel:  only one
thing is unlucky&horbar;the Squirrel has long ago lost all its
teeth.</p>

<h2 id="f084">THE PEASANT AND THE AXE.</h2>

<p>A MOUJIK, who was building a hut, got vexed with his Axe.  The Axe
became disagreeable to him; the Moujik waxed wroth.  The fact was, he
himself hewed abominably; but he lay all the blame on the Axe.  Whatever
happened, the Moujik found an excuse for scolding it.</p>

<p>"Good-for-nothing creature!" he cries, one day, "from this time
forward I will never use you for anything but squaring stakes.  Know
that, with my cleverness and industry, and my dexterity to boot, I shall
get on very well without you, and will cut with a common knife what
another wouldn't be able to hew with an axe."</p>

<p>"It is my lot to work at whatever you lay before me," quietly replied
the Axe to the angry rebuke, "and so your will, master, is sacred for
me.  I am ready to serve you in whatever way you please.  Only reflect
now, that you may not have to repent by-and-bye.  You may blunt me on
useless labour, if you will; but you will certainly never be able to
build huts with a knife."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f085">THE SQUIRREL AND THE THRUSH.</h2>

<p>A CROWD collected in a village, one holiday, under the windows of the
seignorial mansion, looking, with open-mouthed wonder, at a Squirrel in
a revolving cage.  A Thrush also was wondering at it, perched on a
neighbouring birch tree.  The Squirrel ran so fast that his feet seemed
to twinkle, and its bushy tail spread itself straight out.</p>

<p>"Dear old compatriot," asked the Thrush, "can you tell me what you
are doing there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear friend, I have to work hard all day.  I am, in fact, the
courier of a great noble.  So that I can never stop to eat, nor to
drink, nor even to take breath;" and the Squirrel betook itself anew to
running round in its wheel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Thrush, as it flew away, "I can see plainly enough
that you are running; but, for all that, you are always there at the
same window."</p>

<p>Look at some busybody or other.  He worries himself; he rushes to and
fro; every one wonders at him.  It seems as if he were going to jump out
of his skin; only, in spite of all that, he does not make any more
progress than the Squirrel in the wheel.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f086">THE ASS AND JUPITER.</h2>

<p>WHEN Jupiter stocked the universe with the various tribes of animals,
the Ass, among others, came into the world.  But, either purposely or
from an accident owing to the press of work at such a busy time, the
Cloud-compeller made a sad mistake, and the Ass came out of its mould no
larger than a squirrel.  Scarcely any one ever took any notice of the
Ass, although the Ass yielded to no one in pride.  The Ass was much
inclined towards boasting.  But what was it to boast of?  With such a
puny stature, it was ashamed to show itself in the world.  So our
conceited Ass went to Jupiter, and began to pray for a larger
stature.</p>

<p>"Have pity on me!" it cried:  "how can I bear this misery?  Lions,
panthers, elephants, all obtain honour everywhere, and, from the highest
to the lowest, everyone goes on talking about them only.  Why have you
treated Asses so unkindly that they never obtain any honour, and not a
word is ever spoken about them by any one?  But, if I were only as big
as a calf, I would lower the pride of the lions and panthers, and all
the world would be talking about me."</p>

<p>Every day our Ass continued to sing this same song to Jupiter, and
bothered him so that at last he granted its request, and the Ass became
a big beast.  But, besides this, it acquired such a savage voice that
our long-eared Hercules dismayed the whole forest.  "Whatever is that
brute?  What family does it belong to?  It has very long teeth, anyhow,
hasn't it? and no end of horns!"  At last, nothing else was talked about
besides the Ass.</p>

<p>But how did it all end?  Before the year was out, everyone had
discovered what the Ass really was.  Our Ass became proverbial for
stupidity, and, ever since that time, Asses have been beasts of
burden.</p>

<p>Noble birth and high office are excellent things; but how can they
profit a man whose soul is ignoble?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f087">THE CAT AND THE NIGHTINGALE.</h2>

<p>A CAT, which had caught a Nightingale, stuck its claws into the poor
bird, and, pressing it lovingly, said, "Dear Nightingale, my soul!  I
hear that you are everywhere renowned for song, and that you are
considered equal to the finest singers.  My gossip, the Fox, tells me
that your voice is so sonorous and wonderful that, at the sound of your
entrancing songs, all the shepherds and shepherdesses go out of their
wits.  I have greatly desired to hear you&horbar;don't tremble so, and
don't be obstinate, my dear:  never fear; I haven't the least wish to
eat you.  Only sing me something; then I will give you your liberty, and
release you to wander through the woods and forests.  I don't yield to
you in love for music, and I often purr myself to sleep."</p>

<p>Meanwhile our poor Nightingale scarcely breathed under the Cat's
claws.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you begin?" continued the Cat.  "Sing away, dear,
however little it may be."</p>

<p>But our songster didn't sing; only uttered a shrill cry.</p>

<p>"What! is it with that you have entranced the forest?" mockingly
asked the Cat.  "Where is the clearness, the strength, of which every
one talks incessantly?  Such a squeaking I'm tired of hearing from my
kittens.  No; I see that you haven't the least skill in song.  Let's see
how you will taste between my teeth."</p>

<p>And it ate up the poor singer, bones and all.</p>

<p>[This fable, which was published in the year 1824, is said to be
intended to depict the painful position which Russian literature
occupied at the time, with respect to the Censorship.  During that
period of reaction, the press was terribly weighted; and it seemed that,
at last, there would be no subjects left of which it was not forbidden
to take notice.  The censors acted just as they thought
fit&horbar;altered manuscripts, prohibited books, and stopped the
publication of newspapers "till the editors should have knowledge enough
to conduct them properly."  It is a pleasure to compare the position
which the Russian press holds now, with that which it occupied
then.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f088">THE PEASANT AND THE HORSE.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT was sowing oats one day.  Seeing that, a young Horse began
to reason about it, grumbling to itself.</p>

<p>"A pretty piece of work this, for which he brings such a lot of oats
here!  And yet they say men are wiser than we are.  Can anything
possibly be more foolish or ridiculous than to plough up a whole field
like this, in order to scatter one's oats over it afterwards to no
purpose?  Had he given them to me, or to the bay here, or had he even
thought fit to fling them to the fowls, it would have all been more like
business.  Or even if he had hoarded them up, I should have recognised
avarice in that.  But to fling them uselessly away!  No; that is sheer
stupidity."</p>

<p>Meanwhile time passed; and in the autumn the oats were garnered, and
the Peasant fed this very Horse on them.</p>

<p>Reader, there can be no doubt that you do not approve of the Horse's
opinions.  But, from the oldest times to our own days, has not man been
equally audacious in criticising the designs of Providence, although, in
his blind folly, he sees nothing of its means or ends?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f089">THE GNAT AND THE SHEPHERD.</h2>

<p>HAVING confided his sheep to the care of his dogs, a Shepherd went to
sleep in the shade.  Remarking that, a snake glided towards him from
under the bushes, brandishing its forked tongue.  The Shepherd would
have passed away from the world, had not a Gnat taken pity on him, and
stung him with all its might.  Roused from his slumber, the Shepherd
killed the snake.  But first, while half awake and half asleep, he hit
the Gnat such a slap that the poor thing was utterly done for.</p>

<p>There is no lack of examples of this.  If the weak, even with the
best intentions, try to open the eyes of the strong, you may expect that
they will meet with the same fate as the Gnat.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f090">THE WOLF AND THE CAT.</h2>

<p>A WOLF ran out of the forest into a village&horbar;not for a visit,
but to save its life; for it trembled for its skin.  The huntsmen and a
pack of hounds were after it.  It would fain have rushed in through the
first gateway; but there was this unfortunate circumstance in its way,
that all the gateways were closed.  Our Wolf sees a Cat on a partition
fence, and says, pleadingly,</p>

<p>"Vaska, my friend, tell me quickly which of the moujiks here is the
kindest, so that I may hide myself from my evil foes?  Listen to the cry
of the dogs and the terrible sound of the horns!  All that noise is
actually made in chase of me!"</p>

<p>"Go quickly, and ask Stefan," says Vaska the Cat; "he is a very kind
moujik."</p>

<p>"Quite true; only I have torn the skin off one of his sheep."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you can try Demian."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's angry with me, too.  I carried off one of his
kids."</p>

<p>"Run over there, then.  Trofim lives there."</p>

<p>"Trofim!  I should be afraid of even meeting him.  Ever since the
spring, he has been threatening me about a lamb."</p>

<p>"Dear me, that's bad!  But perhaps Klim will protect you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Vaska, I have killed one of his calves."</p>

<p>"What do I hear, gossip?  You've quarrelled with all the village,"
said Vaska to the Wolf.  "What sort of protection can you hope for here?
No; our moujiks are not so destitute of sense as to be willing to save
you to their own hurt.  And really, you have only yourself to blame.
What you have sown, that you must now reap."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f091">THE CANNON AND THE SAILS.</h2>

<p>A FIERCE quarrel arose on board a ship between its Cannon and its
Sails.  Poking their muzzles out of the port-holes, the Cannon thus
murmured heavenward:</p>

<p>"O ye gods! was ever such a thing seen, as that a set of trumpery
linen fabrics should have the insolence to set up for being as useful as
we are?  In the whole course of our laborious voyage, what have they
done?  The moment a breeze begins to blow, they proudly swell out their
breasts, carrying themselves above the waves as pompously as if they
were really of great importance, but yet do nothing more than show off
their airs.  But, as for us, we thunder in battles.  Is it not due to us
that our ship rules the waves?  Do not we carry with us everywhere
terror and death?  No; we do not wish to live any longer with the Sails.
We can do everything for ourselves without them.  Fly, then, to our aid,
mighty Boreas, and quickly tear them into rags."</p>

<p>Boreas heard, and, flying thither, breathed on the sea.  Immediately
the waters were overcast and turned black, a heavy cloud covered the
sky, and the waves ran mountains high.  Thunder deafened the ear;
lightning blinded the eye.  Boreas roared, and tore the sails into
shreds.  When nothing was left of them, the tempest ceased.  But what
followed?  Deprived of its sails, the ship became a sport to the winds
and waves, and drifted about at sea like a log.  And in the first
encounter with a hostile vessel, which thundered terrible broadsides
along its whole length, our ship, now unable to move, was soon riddled
like a sieve, and went down to the bottom like a stone&horbar;Cannon and
all.</p>

<p>Every state is strong when its elements are wisely balanced.  By its
Cannon it is terrible to its foes; but its civil powers play the part of
the Sails.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f092">THE EAGLE AND THE BEE.</h2>

<p>SEEING how a Bee was busying itself about a flower, an Eagle said to
it, with disdain,</p>

<p>"How I pity thee, poor thing, with all thy toil and skill!  All
through the summer, thousands of thy fellows are moulding honeycomb in
the hive.  But who will afterwards separate and distinguish the results
of thy labour?  I must confess, I do not understand what pleasure thou
canst take in it.  To labour all one's life, and to have in
view&horbar;what?  Why, to die without having achieved distinction,
exactly like all the rest.  What a difference there is between us!  When
I spread my sounding pinions, and am borne along near the clouds, I am
everywhere a cause of alarm.  The birds do not dare to rise from the
ground; the shepherds fear to repose beside their well-fed flocks; and
the swift does, having seen me, will not venture out into the
plains."</p>

<p>But the Bee replies,</p>

<p>"To thee be glory and honour!  May Jupiter continue to pour on thee
his bounteous gifts!  I, however, born to work for the common good, do
not seek to make my labour distinguished.  But, when I look at our
honeycombs, I am consoled by the thought that there are in them a few
drops of my own honey."</p>

<p>Fortunate is he, the field of whose labour is conspicuous!  He gains
added strength from the knowledge that the whole world witnesses his
exploits.  But how deserving of respect is he who, in humble obscurity,
hopes for neither fame nor honour in return for all his labour, for all
his loss of rest&horbar;who is animated by this thought only, that he
works for the common good!</p>

<h2 id="f093">THE LION.</h2>

<p>WHEN the Lion became old and weak, his hard bed began to annoy him.
It made his very bones ache; besides, it did not warm him.  So he
summons his nobles to his side, long-haired and shaggy wolves and bears,
and says,</p>

<p>"Friends, to old bones like mine, my bed has now become intolerably
hard.  So find out some way, without oppressing either the poor or the
rich, to collect fleeces for me, that I may not have to sleep on the
bare stones."</p>

<p>"Most illustrious Lion!" answer the grandees, "who would think of
grudging you his skin, not to speak of his fleece?  And are there but
few shaggy beasts among us here?  As to stags, hinds, chamois, and
goats, they scarcely pay any tribute at all.  We will take their fleeces
from them at once.  They will not be any the worse for that; on the
contrary, indeed, they will be all the lighter for it."</p>

<p>This very wise advice was immediately carried out.  The Lion could
not sufficiently praise the zeal of his friends.  But in what had they
shown themselves zealous?  Only in this, that they caught the poor
creatures, and sent them away completely shorn.  But they themselves,
though they were twice as hirsute, did not contribute so much as a
single hair of their own; on the contrary, each of them who happened to
be on the spot turned that tribute to good account, and provided himself
with a mattress for the winter.</p>

<h2 id="f094">THE SWAN, THE PIKE, AND THE CRAB.</h2>

<p>A SWAN, a Crab, and a Pike once undertook to draw a load, and all
three yoked themselves to it together.  They strain away as if they
would burst, but the load makes no way.  Its weight would have seemed
but a light one for them.  But the Swan wings its way into the clouds,
the Crab crawls backwards, and the Pike flops into the water.  Which of
them was in the right, and which in the wrong, it is not for us to
decide.  But the load remains there to the present day.</p>

<p>["From the very commencement of the alliance between France and
England for the protection of Turkey," says Mr. Sutherland Edwards, in
his "Russians at Home," "Russia asserted&horbar;the wish being, of
course, father to the assertion&horbar;that such a union could never
lead to any practical result.  In illustration of this idea, a swan, a
crab, and a pike, each in its own way a water-animal, were represented
in the act of drawing a load&horbar;or rather of attempting to do so,
for the load remained stationary.  Beneath the engraving was printed the
fable (by Krilof) from which the idea was taken."]</p>

<h2 id="f095">THE CORN-FLOWER.</h2>

<p>A CORN-FLOWER which grew in a retired spot suddenly lost its
strength, withered away to little more than half its former size, and,
bowing down its head-over its stalk, sorrowfully awaited its end.
Meanwhile it whispered its complaining to the breeze:</p>

<p>"Ah me! if only the day would soon break, and the shining sun would
illumine the fields, perhaps it might revive even me!"</p>

<p>"Why, what a simpleton you are, my friend!" answered a Beetle, which
happened to be delving near at hand.  "Do you suppose the sun has
nothing else to do than to see how you are getting on, and whether you
are flourishing or fading?  You may be sure that he has neither the time
nor the will to do that!  If you had flown about like me, and learnt to
know the world, you would have perceived that all these meadows,
sweeping pastures, and corn-fields owe to him alone both their life and
their happiness.  He warms the huge oaks and cedars by his heat, and he
richly clothes with wondrous beauty the sweet-smelling flowers.  But
those flowers are utterly different from you.  So precious are they and
so beautiful, that Time himself pities them as he mows them down.  But
as for you, you are neither splendid nor fragrant, so don't annoy the
sun by your importunity!  Make up your mind that he won't spare you a
ray, and cease to strive after what cannot be got.  Hold your tongue,
and wither!"</p>

<p>But the sun arose, illuminating all nature, and widely scattering its
beams over the kingdom of Flora.  And the poor Corn-flower, which had
begun to fade away in the night, was brought back to life by its
celestial regard.</p>

<p>O ye upon whom Fate has conferred high dignity, take as an example
for yourselves this sun of which I have spoken.  Wherever his light
falls, there it benefits all alike, whether it be a cedar or a blade of
grass, and there it leaves behind it joy and happiness; wherefore, also,
its image glitters in the hearts of all, as shines in Eastern crystals a
limpid light, and all things that be invoke blessings upon it.</p>

<p>[In 1823 Krilof was for some time seriously ill.  When the Empress
Maria Fedorovna heard of his attack, she told his friends to send him to
Pavlovsk, where she was staying at that time, saying, "He will recover
quicker under my charge."  Accordingly he went there as soon as he
became convalescent, and remained there for some time.  Before he left
he composed the poem of the Corn-flower, and placed it one day in an
album belonging to the Empress, which he found lying in the "Pavilion of
Roses."]</p>

<h2 id="f096">PARNASSUS.</h2>

<p>AFTER the Gods had been driven out of Greece, and when their domains
were being divided among mortals, a certain man had Parnassus itself
allotted to him.  The new landlord turned out a number of Asses to graze
on it.  Now these Asses had learnt, somehow or other, that the Muses
used to live there in former times; so they said,</p>

<p>"It wasn't for nothing that we were turned out on Parnassus.  It is
evident that the world is tired of the Muses, and it wants us to take to
singing here."</p>

<p>Then one exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Look sharp there, and don't lose heart.  I will lead off; mind you
are not behindhand.  We must not be timid, friends.  Rather will we lift
up our voices louder than those of the Nine Sisters, rendering our herd
illustrious.  And we will form our own choir, and, in order that our
confraternity may not be disconcerted, we will establish among ourselves
such a regulation as this&horbar;that we will not admit upon Parnassus
any but those in whose voices the asinine charm is to be found."</p>

<p>The Asses approved of the beautiful and artistically-constructed
speech of the Ass, and the novel choir set up a screech that sounded as
if a train of waggons were rolling along on a thousand unoiled wheels.
But how did the varied beauty of the singing end?  Why, the landlord,
losing all patience, drove them away from Parnassus into his stable.</p>

<p>If it will not hurt the feelings of the uncultivated, I should like
to quote the ancient saw:</p>

<blockquote>
"To a head that is empty no art can add brains:<br>
Though you place it in office&horbar;it empty remains."
</blockquote>

<p>[This fable is supposed to refer to the downfall of what was called
the "English" Ministry in Russia, after the meeting which took place at
Tilsit between Alexander I. and Napoleon.  When Alexander came to the
throne he displaced most of the old Ministers, and gave their portfolios
to young men who shared his own liberal ideas.  They held office for
five years.  Then came the change in Alexander's policy, which drove
them out, so that by the end of 1807 not one of them was left in power.
Krilof, as a Conservative, and an admirer of the old school of
politicians formed under Catherine II., was delighted at the fall of the
"Young-Russian" Ministry.]</p>

<h2 id="f097">THE LINNET AND THE HEDGEHOG.</h2>

<p>A TIMID Linnet, a lover of solitude, was chirruping away to itself
one morning at daybreak, but not because it wanted to be
applauded&horbar;and, indeed, there could not have been any reason for
applauding it; its song flowed from it involuntarily.</p>

<p>But, see! in all his blaze of glory resplendent Ph&oelig;bus rose
from out of the waves, seeming to bring life to all things along with
him; and to welcome him, a chorus of clear-voiced nightingales made the
dense woods resound with song.  Our Linnet became silent.</p>

<p>"But you, my friend, why don't you sing?" tauntingly asked the
Hedgehog.</p>

<p>"Because my voice is not fit for worthily extolling Ph&oelig;bus,"
answered the poor Linnet, through its tears.  "With a feeble voice I
cannot venture to sing of Ph&oelig;bus."</p>

<p>So I, too, grieve, and complain that Pindar's lyre did not fall to my
lot.  Had that been the case I would have sung of Alexander.</p>

<p>[This little poem derives its main interest from the fact that Krilof
refers in it to himself.  When Alexander I. was on his way back to
Russia after the occupation of Paris, the poets of the day broke out
into a chorus of congratulatory song.  Krilof's friends advised him to
write a poem on the subject.  But about a month before Alexander
returned, Krilof paid a visit to the Empress-Dowager, Maria Fedorovna,
and recited to her this little fable.]</p>

<h2 id="f098">THE WOOD AND THE FIRE.</h2>

<p>ONE winter day the remains of a Fire were smouldering in a Wood,
forgotten there, no doubt, by some chance travellers.  Hour by hour the
Fire grew weaker.  No fresh fuel being supplied to it, our Fire almost
ceased to burn, and, seeing its end near at hand, thus spoke to the
Wood:</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear Wood, why your fate is so hard that not a leaflet can
be seen on you, and you are freezing in utter bareness?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied the Wood, "I cannot put forth buds or foliage in
the winter-time, when the snow is over all."</p>

<p>"A mere trifle!" continues the Fire.  "Only ally yourself with me.  I
will assist you.  I am the Sun's brother; and, in the winter season, I
work miracles as much as the Sun.  Ask about the fire in hothouses;
inside them, during the winter, when the snow falls and the storm-wind
is blowing without, everything is either blossoming or ripening, and
that is all due to me.  Self-praise is unbecoming, and I detest
bragging; but as far as strength is concerned I will in nowise yield to
the Sun.  However proudly he may have shone here, he has gone to his bed
without doing any harm to the snow.  But around me, only see how the
snow has melted.  So if you want to grow green in winter, just as in
spring and summer, grant me a little corner of your space."</p>

<p>See, the matter is agreed about:  already, there, in the wood, have
the smouldering embers become a fire; and that fire does not sleep.  It
runs along the branches and among the twigs.  A black smoke soars in
wreaths to the clouds, and a fierce flame suddenly enwraps the whole
Wood.  All perishes utterly; and there, where upon sultry days the
traveller used to find a refuge in the shade, only blackened stumps
stand out a little from the ground.</p>

<p>Not that there is anything to wonder at in this, for how can wood and
fire be friends?</p>

<h2 id="f099">THE TITMOUSE.</h2>

<p>A TITMOUSE made assault upon the sea, boasting that it would burn the
sea up.  Immediately there went abroad through all the world much talk
about that.  Fear seized upon the inhabitants of Neptune's metropolis.
The birds flew in troops, and the beasts ran down together from the
forests, to see in what manner the ocean would take fire, and whether it
would burn furiously.  It is even said, on the authority of the
feathered tribe, that the human haunters of festal tables were among the
first to appear on the shore, all provided with spoons, so as to enjoy
so rich a fish soup as not even the most liberal of contractors had ever
given to Government officials.</p>

<p>They swarm around.  Each one marvels at the prodigy beforehand, and,
in utter silence, fixing his eyes upon the sea, awaits the result.  Only
at times will one of them whisper, "There, it is going to boil!  Look!
it will begin to burn in a minute!"</p>

<p>Not a bit of it! the sea does not burn.  But at all events doesn't it
boil?  It does not even boil.  Well, then, how did these stupendous
projects end?  Why, the Titmouse had to fly away home in disgrace.  The
Titmouse had made a noise in the world, but it had not set the sea on
fire.</p>

<h2 id="f100">THE MONKEYS.</h2>

<p>WHEN folks imitate discreetly, there is no wonder in their gaining by
the process.  But, as to indiscreet imitation&horbar;Heaven protect us!
what a terrible thing that is!</p>

<p>I will give you an illustration of this, brought from a far-off
land.</p>

<p>All who have seen monkeys know how fond they are of imitating
everything.  Well, one day, in Africa, where monkeys are numerous, there
was a whole troop of them sitting on the boughs and branches of a thick
tree, and looking aside at a hunter, watching how he rolled about on the
grass among his nets.  Each one gave her neighbour a quiet nudge in the
ribs, and they all began to whisper to each other&horbar;</p>

<p>"Just look at the fine fellow!  Really it would seem that there is no
end to his frolics!  How he rolls over and over&horbar;turns himself
inside out, and coils himself up into a ball so that one can't see
either his hands or his feet!  It is true that we are already well
skilled in everything, but such science as that has never even been seen
among us before.  Sister beauties! it would not be a bad idea for us to
imitate it!  That fellow seems to have amused himself enough; perhaps he
will go away, and then we will at once&horbar;"</p>

<p>See, he really has gone away and left the nets to them.</p>

<p>"There now!" they say, "ought we to lose any time?  Let's go and make
an experiment."</p>

<p>The beauties descend.  For the dear guests a quantity of nets have
been spread down below.  They begin to turn head over heels, to roll
about, to envelope and entangle themselves in the toils.  They
cry&horbar;they squeal! their joy is at its height.  But see! when it
comes to extricating themselves from the nets, it is a bad business for
them!  Their entertainer has been all along on the watch, and, when he
sees the time has come, he provides himself with sacks and walks up to
his guests.  Fain would they take to flight, but not one of them can get
free now; and so, one after the other, they are all made prisoners.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f101">THE DUCAT.</h2>

<p>IS civilization profitable?  Profitable!&horbar;that is not the
question.  But we often give the name of civilization to luxury's
seductions, and even to demoralization.  Therefore you must pay close
attention, so that, when you rid people of their superficial coarseness,
you may not at the same time rob them of their good qualities, enfeeble
their souls, spoil their morals, deprive them of their simplicity, and,
having given them in exchange merely an empty brilliance, burden them
with infamy instead of good repute.</p>

<p>About this sacred truth one might make a whole volume of serious
sermons, but serious speaking does not befit every one; so, half in
jest, I am going to prove it to you by means of a fable.</p>

<p>A Peasant, a thorough blockhead (there are plenty of such people
everywhere) found a Ducat lying on the ground.  The Ducat was dusty and
dirty, but three double handfuls of five-kopeck pieces were ready to be
given to the Peasant in exchange for it.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit!" thinks the Peasant:  "they'll give me twice as much
presently.  I've hit on such a plan that they'll try to get it from me
with both hands."</p>

<p>Hereupon, having taken sand, gravel, chalk, and brick-dust, our
Moujik sets to work, and with all his might chafes the Ducat against the
gravel, grinds it with sand and brick-dust, and rubs it with chalk.</p>

<p>Well, to speak briefly, he wants to make it shine like fire, and like
actual fire the Ducat begins to gleam.  Only&horbar;its weight
diminished, and so the Ducat lost its ancient value.</p>

<p>[During the early years of the reign of Alexander I., a great deal
was done in the name of enlightenment.  It was proposed to found
educational establishments all over Russia.  Three Universities were
reformed, and two were completely reconstituted; three High Schools were
founded, together with twenty-six Gymnasia and eighty District Schools.
A thirst for instruction began to make itself felt among all the classes
of the Russian people.  The rich subscribed liberally; even the poor
"laid their mite on the altar of national enlightenment."  Between the
years 1800 and 1812 more than three hundred educational establishments
of different kinds were opened.  In the eventful year 1812 itself no
less than fifty-one new schools were made available.</p>

<p>Even the peasants contributed towards the funds which were subscribed
for the new colleges and schools.  But in these new schools French
teachers exercised great influence, and Krilof detested that influence
as being hostile to patriotic feeling.  Hence arose his want of sympathy
with that desire for education which for a time seemed likely to become
universal.]</p>

<h2 id="f102">THE TRAVELLERS AND THE DOGS.</h2>

<p>ONE evening two friends were walking along, and carrying on a
sensible conversation, when suddenly from the threshold of a gateway a
yard-dog began to bark at them.  After it began a second, then two or
three others, and in another moment half a hundred dogs had run together
from all the courtyards.  Already was one of the travellers on the point
of picking up a stone, when the other one said to him,</p>

<p>"Hold hard, brother!  You won't prevent the dogs from barking; you
will only provoke the pack all the more.  Let's go straight on.  I know
their nature better."</p>

<p>And, in fact, they had only gone some fifty paces when the dogs
gradually began to calm down, and at last they could not be heard at
all.</p>

<p>The envious can look at nothing without setting up a howl at it.  But
you go your own way.  They may continue barking for awhile&horbar;but
they will leave off.</p>

<p>[A recent critic, M. Fleury, has called attention to the resemblance
between this fable and the following, extracted from the preface to
Voltaire's "Alzire":  "Un Voyageur &eacute;tait importun&eacute; dans
son chemin du bruit des cigales; il s'arr&ecirc;ta pour les tuer; il
n'en vint pas &agrave; bout, et ne fit que s'&eacute;carter de sa route.
Il n'avait qu' a continuer paisiblement son voyage; les cigales seraient
mortes d'elles-m&ecirc;mes au bout de huit jours."</p>

which refers mainly to literary critics.]</p>

<h2 id="f103">THE PEASANT AND THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>A SNAKE came and asked a Peasant to take it into his house.  Not to
live there idly without working&horbar;no, it wanted to look after his
children.  Bread is sweetest when it is earned by labour.</p>

<p>"I know," it says, "what a bad name snakes have got among you
men&horbar;how they are all supposed to be of the very worst character.
From the remotest times rumour has asserted that gratitude is unknown to
them, that they know neither friendship nor relationship, and that they
devour even their own little ones.  All that may be true, but I am not
one of that sort.  Not only have I never bitten anybody in my life, but
I have such a loathing for everything that is hurtful, that I would have
had my sting pulled out of me if I could only have been sure that I
could live without one.  To speak briefly:  of all snakes I am the best.
Judge, then, how fond I shall be of your children!"</p>

<p>"Even supposing all that isn't all lies," answers the Peasant, "yet
it's quite impossible for me to take you in.  As soon as one specimen of
the kind got to be liked among us, a hundred bad snakes would come
crawling in after the one good one, and would be the ruin of all our
children here.  Indeed I fancy, my dear creature, that it is impossible
for you and me to live on good terms together, for, according to my
ideas, the very best of snakes is not good enough for even the devil
himself."</p>

the <i>Grande Arm&eacute;e</i>&horbar;were dispersed about Russia, and
very kindly treated, being made much of at all convivial meetings, and
readily accepted as tutors, sometimes as husbands.  Against all this

<h2 id="f104">THE FLOWERS.</h2>

<p>AT the open window of a sumptuous apartment, arranged in vases of
many-coloured porcelain, a number of Artificial Flowers waved proudly on
their wire stalks&horbar;real flowers standing beside them the
while&horbar;and exhibited their charms to universal admiration.</p>

<p>But, see! a shower has begun to fall.  The taffeta Flowers
straightway adjure Jupiter, asking if the rain cannot be stopped,
abusing and defaming it in every way.</p>

<p>"O Jupiter," they pray, "do put a stop to this shower!  What good is
there in it? what on earth can be worse than it is?  Why, see! walking
in the streets is impossible, for it has turned them into nothing but
mud and puddles."</p>

<p>But Jupiter gave no heed to their idle prayer, and the shower had it
all its own way, dispelled the great heat, and made the air cool.  All
nature revived, and the verdure on every side seemed to spring up
anew.</p>

<p>Then, among other things, the real flowers in the window expanded in
all their beauty, fresher for the rain, softer and more fragrant.  But
by that time the Artificial Flowers, poor things! had lost all their
beauty, and they were thrown into the yard as rubbish.</p>

<h2 id="f105">THE FIRE AND THE DIAMOND.</h2>

<p>SPREADING from a spark into a conflagration, a Fire, in the dead of
midnight, rushed with furious impetuosity through a pile of
buildings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a Diamond, which had been lost in the universal alarm,
faintly glimmered through the dust of the road in which it lay.</p>

<p>"How thoroughly art thou, in spite of all, thy play of light,
annihilated in my presence!" said the Fire.  "And how practised must be
that sight which can distinguish thee, at a little distance, from either
a bit of glass or a drop of water in which my light or that of the sun
shines reflected! not to speak of how much damage is done to thee by
anything that falls upon thee&horbar;any trifle, a mere scrap of ribbon.
How often, for instance, does a single hair which has wound itself about
thee dim thy brilliance!  Not so easily is my radiance to be eclipsed
when I encompass a building in my wrath.  See how I despise all the
efforts people are making against me!  How I devour with a crackling all
that I encounter! while my glare, playing upon the clouds, brings fear
upon all the land around!"</p>

<p>"It is true that my light is really but a poor one compared with
thine," answered the Diamond.  "But I am harmless.  None can accuse me
of having injured any one, and to envy alone is my light distasteful.
But thou shinest, thou flashest, only by means of that which destroys;
therefore, see how all, uniting their whole strength, strive that thou
mayest be extinguished as soon as possible.  And the more furiously thou
blazest, the quicker, perhaps, dost thou draw to thy end."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the people strove with all their might to put out the Fire.
By the morning nothing was left of it but smoke and stench.  But the
Diamond was soon recovered, and it became the chief ornament of the
royal crown.</p>

<h2 id="f106">THE POND AND THE RIVER.</h2>

<p>"HOW comes it," said to a River a neighbouring Pond, "that one never
looks at you without finding your waters always in movement?  Is it
possible, sister dear, that you do not grow tired?  Besides, I see that
you are almost always supporting either heavily-laden ships or long
lines of timber-rafts; I say nothing at present about boats and barges:
their number is infinite!  When will you have done with such a life?  I
should really dry up from vexation if mine were like it.</p>

<p>"But, in comparison with yours, how pleasant is my lot!  It is true
that I am not known to fame.  I do not meander across a whole sheet of
the map; no dulcimer player twangs out praises in my honour:  all that
is, in reality, mere nonsense.  But I, on my soft and slimy banks,
repose in tranquil indulgence, like a fine lady on cushions of down.
And not only have I no ships or rafts to fear, but I do not even know
what the weight of a boat is.  Nay, more, I think it a great event if a
leaf, which the breeze has wafted to me, undulates on my waters.  What
equivalent could be offered for a life so free from cares?  Left behind,
unruffled by the winds from whatever quarter they may blow, I know no
movement, but look on, as in a dream, at the world's anxieties, and
philosophize the while."</p>

<p>"But, while philosophizing, do you bear in mind this law," replied
the River, "that only by movement can water preserve its freshness?  If
I have become a great river, it has been because, spurning rest, I obey
that law.  Therefore is it that, year after year, I benefit by the
abundance and purity of my waters, and gain honour and glory.  It may
be, too, that for ages to come I shall still flow on, when you will no
longer exist even in memory, and all mention of you will have utterly
come to an end."</p>

<p>The words of the River were fulfilled:  to this day it still flows
on.  But the poor Pond, becoming every year less liquid, and more and
more choked up with thick ooze, turned mouldy, produced a crop of sedge,
and finally dried up.</p>

<h2 id="f107">THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE.</h2>

<p>AN Eagle and his mate flew into a deep forest, and determined to make
it their permanent abode.  So they chose an oak, lofty and
wide-spreading, and began to build themselves a nest on the top of it,
hoping there to rear their young in the summer.</p>

<p>A Mole, who heard about all this, plucked up courage enough to inform
the Eagles that the oak was not a proper dwelling-place for them; that
it was almost entirely rotten at the root, and was likely soon to fall,
and that therefore the Eagles ought not to make their nest upon it.</p>

<p>But is it becoming that an Eagle should accept advice coming from a
Mole in a hole?  Where then would be the glory of an Eagle having such
keen eyes?  And how comes it that Moles dare to meddle in the affairs of
the King of Birds?</p>

<p>So, saying very little to the Mole, whose counsel he despised, the
Eagle set to work quickly&horbar;and the King soon got ready the new
dwelling for the Queen.</p>

<p>All goes well, and now the Eagles have little ones.  But what
happens?  One day, when at early dawn the Eagle is hastening back from
the chase, bringing a rich breakfast to his family, as he drops down
from the sky he sees&horbar;his oak has fallen, and has crushed beneath
it his mate and his little ones!</p>

<p>"Wretched creature that I am!" he cries, anguish blotting out from
him the light; "for my pride has Fate so terribly punished me, and
because I gave no heed to wise counsel.  But could one expect that wise
counsel could possibly come from a miserable Mole?"</p>

<p>Then from its hole the Mole replies:</p>

<p>"Had not you despised me, you would have remembered that I burrow
within the earth, and that, as I live among the roots, I can tell with
certainty whether a tree be sound or no."</p>

<h2 id="f108">THE STARLING.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN Starling learnt, in early life, to sing as like a goldfinch
as if it had been born a goldfinch itself.  The whole forest was
enlivened by its sportive little lay, and the dear Starling was the
theme of universal praise.</p>

<p>Any other bird would have been content with such honours.  But our
Starling heard the nightingale being praised.  Our Starling, to its
sorrow, became jealous.</p>

<p>"Just wait a little, my friends," it thinks; "I will sing in the
nightingale's style too, and every bit as well."</p>

<p>And it really did begin singing, only it was in a style quite
different from anything else.  It squeaked, it growled, it whimpered
like a kid, and, without the least reason for doing so, mewed like a
kitten.  To be brief, its singing made all the other birds take to
flight.</p>

<p>Well, my dear Starling! what have you gained by that?  Better sing a
goldfinch's song well, than a nightingale's badly.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f109">THE TREE.</h2>

<p>"DEAR friend," cried a young Sapling to a peasant, whom it saw
carrying an axe, "please clear away the forest around me.  I cannot grow
comfortably, nor can I see the light of the sun; my roots have not space
enough, and the breezes are not at liberty to sport around me; such
arches has it thought fit to weave above me.  If it were not for its
impeding my growth I should become the ornament of the neighbourhood in
a year, and all the valley would be covered by my shade.  But as it is I
am thin and frail, almost like a withered branch."</p>

<p>The peasant took to his axe and rendered service to the Tree as to a
friend.  Around the sapling a great space was cleared, but not long did
its triumph last!  At one time it was parched by the sun, at another it
was knocked about by hail or rain, and at last it was snapped in two by
the wind.  "Fool!" then said to it a Snake, "have you not brought your
misfortune upon yourself?  If you had grown up, hidden by the forest,
neither heat nor storm would have been able to hurt you.  The old trees
would have protected you; and if a time had come when their season was
past and they disappeared, then you, in your turn, would have so
flourished, would have become so strongly built and firmly rooted, that
your present misfortune would never have happened to you, and you would,
perhaps, have been able to encounter even the hurricane."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f110">THE PEASANT AND THE FOX.</h2>

<p>"TELL me, gossip, how is it you have such a passion for stealing
fowls?" said a Peasant to a Fox he happened to meet.  "I declare I feel
quite sorry for you.  Listen now; we are alone here, and I will tell you
the whole truth.  In your way of living there really is not a grain of
good to be seen&horbar;not to mention that theft is a sin and a shame,
and that all the world curses you; and there never is a single day on
which you are not afraid, by way of payment for your dinner or supper,
of leaving your skin behind you in the poultry-yard.  Now, are all the
fowls in the world worth this?"</p>

<p>"Who could find such a life endurable?" answered the Fox.  "I am so
disgusted with everything in it that I find my very food distasteful;
and if you only knew how pure I am in heart!  But what is one to do?  I
have wants; I have children.  Besides, dear gossip, the thought
sometimes comes into my head that, perhaps, I am not the only one in the
world who lives by stealing, and yet that profession is to me just as it
were a sharp knife stuck into me."</p>

<p>"Very good," says the Peasant "If you are really not telling lies, I
will save you from sinning, and provide you with honest food.  Hire
yourself to me to guard my poultry-yard against the foxes.  Who but a
fox is likely to know all foxish tricks?  And in return for this you
shall want for nothing:  in my service you will roll like a cheese in
butter."</p>

<p>The bargain was struck, and from that very hour the Fox went upon
guard.  The Fox led a life of abundance at the Peasant's.  The Fox grew
fuller, the Fox grew fatter, but the Fox did not grow more honest.  Food
which had not been stolen soon became distasteful to him, and our gossip
ended his service by taking advantage of an unusually dark night, and
throttling every fowl his dear friend possessed.</p>

<h2 id="f111">THE GARDENER AND THE PHILOSOPHER.</h2>

<p>ONE spring, a Gardener took to digging away among his beds as
vigorously as if he were in hopes of digging up a treasure.  A
mettlesome workman was the Moujik, and stout and fresh to look at.
Before long he had prepared some fifty beds for cucumbers alone.</p>

<p>Next door to him lived an amateur of gardens, both kitchen and
flower&horbar;a very fine talker, a friend of Nature, as he called
himself, a philosopher of the superficial school, one who chatted away
about gardens from book-knowledge only.</p>

<p>One day he took it into his head to look after his own garden, and
he, too, determined to rear cucumbers, and in the meantime he thus
flouted his neighbour:</p>

<p>"Sweat away, neighbour, as much as you like, but my work will leave
yours far behind, and by the side of my garden yours will look like a
desert.  Yes, to tell the truth, I have often been quite astounded at
seeing that that miserable little garden of yours gets on at all.  How
is it you have not been ruined before now?  I suppose you have never
paid the least attention to science?"</p>

<p>"Never had the time," was the neighbour's answer.  "Industry,
practice, a pair of arms&horbar;these are all the sciences I have.  But
just as they are, God gives me bread with them."</p>

<p>"Clodhopper!  Do you dare to set yourself up against science?"</p>

<p>"No, master; don't go twisting my words askew like that.  If you
invent anything clever, I'll always be ready to copy you."</p>

<p>"Well, well! we shall see; just let's wait till summer&horbar;"</p>

<p>"But, master, isn't this the time for taking the matter in hand?
I've already begun sowing and planting, but you haven't even dug over
your beds yet."</p>

<p>"Why, no, I haven't done any digging yet for want of leisure.  I've
been spending all my time in reading, trying to find out from my books
whether I should dig the beds with a spade, or whether it would not be
better to use one of the two kinds of ploughs, and if so, which of the
two?  But the season is not going to pass away just yet."</p>

<p>"Not from you, perhaps; but it won't be much inclined to wait for
me," said the Gardener, turning away and taking to his spade again.</p>

<p>The Philosopher went home and began reading, making extracts,
inquiring, and digging away in his library and in his garden, always at
work from morn till eve.  Scarcely had he finished one piece of work,
hardly had anything come up in the beds, when he would find some fresh
discovery in the newspapers.  Straightway he would dig up everything,
transplant everything, on another plan, to a new tune.</p>

<p>What, then, was the result of all this?  Everything the Gardener had
sown came up and ripened.  His affairs went well, and brought him in
profit.  But as for the Philosopher&horbar;not a single cucumber had
he.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f112">THE DOG.</h2>

<p>A GENTLEMAN had a dog that was given to thieving.  And yet there was
nothing it stood in need of.  Any other dog in such a kind of life would
have been happy and contented, and would never have dreamt of stealing.
But this one had such a mania for it that whenever it got hold of a
piece of meat it instantly bolted with it.</p>

<p>In spite of all the pains his master gave himself, he could not get
on with it, until at last a friend interfered and helped him with this
piece of advice:</p>

<p>"Listen," he said.  "Although you are severe, it seems, yet you only
accustom your dog to steal, inasmuch as you always let him keep his
stolen morsel.  But suppose you beat him less in future, only take away
from him what he has stolen."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the dog experienced the effect of this wise counsel
when&horbar;the dog gave up stealing.</p>

<p>[This fable, like that of "The Bear among the Bees," refers to the
corruption which used to be so prevalent in Russian official circles.
In the dog of the one story and the bear of the other, individual
functionaries of evil repute were in all probability represented, but
their real names are unknown.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f113">THE APE.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT at the dawn of day went toiling over his bit of ground
behind his plough.  So hard did our peasant toil, that the sweat poured
off him like hail.  Our Moujik was a thorough workman, and therefore
everybody who went past called out to him, "Well done!  Good luck to
you!"</p>

<p>This made an Ape jealous.  Praise is tempting:  how can one help
longing for it?  So the Ape took it into his head to work, got hold of a
log, and just did plague himself over it.  The Ape's mouth becomes full
of trouble.  Now he lifts up the log, and now embraces it, first this
way, then that; now he drags it along, now he rolls it about.  The sweat
runs off the poor creature in a stream.  At last, groaning and gasping,
he can scarcely draw his breath.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all this, he does not hear a soul give him an
atom of praise.  And no wonder, my dear!  You take a world of pains, but
what you do is utterly useless.</p>

<p>[This fable is suspiciously like one of Sumarokof's, called "The
Ploughman and the Monkey," in which the man gets praised, while the
monkey, who is toiling away with a stone, gets nothing but a scolding,
and cannot make out why.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f114">THE CASK.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN man asked a friend to lend him a cask for two or three
days.  Now, in friendship, a readiness to oblige is a holy thing.  You
see, if the matter had been one of money, that would have been quite
another question.  In that case friendship would have been beside the
mark, and it would have been possible to refuse.  But as to lending a
cask&horbar;why shouldn't one?</p>

<p>When it had been returned, they began carrying water in it again.
And everything would have been all right about it if it had not been for
this&horbar;that a spirit merchant had used it for keeping brandy in,
and it had become so saturated with the spirit in a couple of days, that
it communicated a flavour of brandy to everything that was put into
it&horbar;to kvass or beer, whichever had been brewed, or even to
eatables.</p>

<p>Almost an entire year did its owner bother himself about it:  at one
time scalded it, at another hung it out to air in the breeze.  But let
him pour into it what he liked, the spirituous flavour would not go out
of it a bit.  And so, at last, he was obliged to part with the cask.</p>

<p>Fathers! try not to forget this fable.  If in his young days one of
us has ever happened to be steeped in the current of a hurtful teaching,
then in all his actions and behaviour afterwards, whatever he may be in
words, there will always be perceptible a kind of after-taste of it.</p>

<p>[This fable seems only an expansion of the lines of Horace:</p>

<blockquote>
"Nunc adbibe puro<br>
Pectore verba, puer, nunc te melioribus offer.<br>
Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem<br>
Tesu diu."&horbar;<i>Epist</i>. I. 2.
</blockquote>

<p>An idea which was expanded by St.  Jerome as follows:</p>

<p>"Difficulter eraditur, quod rudes animi perbiberunt.  Lanarum
conchylia quis in pristinum colorem revocet?  Rudis testa diu et saporem
retinet et odorem, quo primum imbuta est."&horbar;<i>Epist., ad
L&aelig;tam</i></p>

<p>In a quaint version published in 1630, the passage is thus
translated:</p>

<p>"That is hardly scraped out, which young unfashioned mindes have
drunke in.  Who shall be able to reduce purple woolls to the former
whitenes?  A new vessell long retaynes both the odour and taste, whereof
it received the first impression."</p>

<p>Krilof felt strongly on the subject of education, to which he devoted
three of his fables:  "The Peasant and the Snake," "The Cask," and "The
Education of the Lion," besides two comedies&horbar;the "Fashions Shop,"
and the "Lesson for Daughters."  In his "Spirit Post" he says:  "A
hundred years ago people educated their children themselves, caring only
about their being honest, brave in war, and firm under misfortune.
Parents tried to be good in those days in order to set a good example to
their children.  People were not eloquent, but they spoke truths which
stood in no need of eloquence.  But now it is thought that a man cannot
be a good citizen unless he can dance, play cards, talk French, and
chatter away all the day long.  And for all that French tutors are
needed."</p>

<p>Krilof hated these French tutors, for he remained firmly attached to
old-fashioned views about religion and politics.  At the time when the
fable was written, in the year 1814, the Empire had been greatly
influenced by the teachings of the Mysticists on the one hand and the
Freethinkers on the other.  After 1812, so many Frenchmen remained in
Russia as teachers, that French ideas spread widely among the younger
Russians of the upper class.</p>

<h2 id="f115">THE NOBLEMAN AND THE PHILOSOPHER.</h2>

<p>A NOBLEMAN chatting with a Sage during an idle hour about one thing
and the other, said,</p>

<p>"Tell me, you who thoroughly know the world, and read the hearts of
people like a book, how is it that, whenever we lay the foundation of an
assembly or a learned society, we scarcely have time to take a look
around us, before the blockheads manage to worm themselves in among the
first comers?  Is it possible that absolutely no remedy exists against
them?"</p>

<p>"I think not," replied the Sage.  "The fate of learned societies is
the same, between ourselves, as that of houses made of wood."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Why, this way.  I have just now finished building one for myself.
Its proprietors have not yet moved into it, but the crickets have ever
so long ago taken up their quarters in it."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f116">THE HORSE AND ITS RIDER.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN Cavalier had so schooled his horse, that he could do
whatever he liked with it.  He scarcely made any use of the reins:  the
Horse obeyed his mere word.</p>

<p>"There's no use in bridling such horses," said its master one day.
"Upon my word, I've hit on a capital idea!"</p>

<p>And riding out afield he unbridled the horse.</p>

<p>When it felt itself free, the horse at first only increased its pace
a little, and, tossing its head and shaking its mane, it speeded with
playful gait as if to amuse its rider.</p>

<p>But when it remarked how weak was now the power that used to control
it, the mettlesome horse soon began to follow its own will.  Its blood
boiled, its eyes glowed.  No longer listening to the voice of its rider,
it whirled him along at full speed right across the open country.</p>

<p>In vain did our unfortunate rider attempt with trembling hands to
throw the bridle over its head.  The horse only became the fiercer, and
away it tore, until at last it flung its rider far from its back.  Then
away, like a whirling storm-wind, it rushed, blind to the light of
heaven, not seeing where it went, until it fell headlong into a ravine,
and was knocked to pieces.</p>

<p>"My poor horse!" said its rider, when he heard of its death.  "It was
I who brought about thy misfortune.  If I had not taken off thy bridle,
I should certainly have been able to guide thee.  Then thou wouldst not
have thrown me, nor wouldst thou have died so pitiful a death!"</p>

<p>How alluring is liberty!  But for a people it is no less destructive,
unless reasonable bounds are set to it.</p>

<p>[It has been supposed that Krilof meant this fable to apply to the
revolutionary agitation in Russia, which began to manifest itself after
the war with Napoleon, and which went on increasing till its unfortunate
outbreak in 1825.  But it was written before that agitation commenced,
the original MS. being dated May 12, 1814, and it is probable that
Krilof, when he composed it, was thinking only of the French
Revolution.</p>

<p>There is a poem by Derjavine called the <i>Kolesnitsa</i>, or
"Chariot," to which this fable bears a strong likeness.]</p>

<h2 id="f117">THE GOOD FOX.</h2>

<p>A SPORTSMAN killed a redcap one spring.  Would that the evil he
wrought had ended with her life!  But, no&horbar;after hers three more
lives had to be lost.  The sportsman had made orphans of her three
little ones, poor creatures!  Only just out of the shell, feeble and
ignorant, they suffered from cold and hunger, calling in vain upon their
dam with plaintive cry.</p>

<p>"How can one help grieving at the sight of these little ones, and
whose heart does not ache for them?"  Thus were the neighbouring birds
addressed by a Fox, who was sitting on a bit of stone opposite the nest
of the orphans.  "Don't leave these young creatures unassisted, my dear
friends.  If you will only bring the poor little darlings a tiny grain
apiece, if each of you will only add to their dear little nest ever so
small a straw, you will thereby save their lives.  And what is more holy
than a good deed?</p>

<p>"O cuckoo dear! just see how thou art moulting!  Would it not be as
well for thee to allow thyself to be plucked a little, and to give thy
feathers to garnish their little bed?  Really, thou art now losing them
uselessly.</p>

<p>"O lark! suppose that, instead of turning and tumbling about high up
in the air, thou wert sometimes to look for food in the corn-field and
the meadow, and to share it with the orphans.</p>

<p>"O turtle-dove! thy young ones have now grown up; they are able to
procure their own food now, so it is possible for thee to fly from thy
own nest, and take their mother's place over these little ones, leaving
God to watch over thy own offspring.</p>

<p>"O swallow! suppose thou wert to catch flies, so as to make the fare
of the orphans a little more dainty.</p>

<p>"And thou, dear nightingale, thou knowest how all things feel the
charm of thy voice.  Why shouldst thou not lull the little ones to rest
by thy sweet song, while the zephyr rocks them in their nest?</p>

<p>"By such kindness, I am convinced, ye would make up to them for their
sad loss.  Only listen to me&horbar;we will prove that there are kind
hearts in the forest, and that&horbar;&horbar;"</p>

<p>As the Fox was saying these words, all three of the poor little
birds, prevented by their hunger from keeping still, fell down on the
ground just in front of him.</p>

<p>What did their kind friend do?  Gobbled them up immediately, without
finishing his sermon!</p>

<p>[This fable bears a good deal of resemblance to Florian's "Renard qui
pr&ecirc;che" which was translated by Dmitrief under the title of "The
Preaching Fox."  Kenevich thinks that it relates to the subscriptions
which were organized in 1814&horbar;the year in which it
appeared&horbar;for the benefit of the families which had been ruined
during the French invasion.  Some of the persons who got up these
subscriptions, or who wrote letters about them to the papers, were
supposed to be actuated by not quite disinterested motives.]</p>

<h2 id="f118">THE COMMUNAL ASSEMBLY.</h2>

<p>THE Wolf asked the Lion to appoint him inspector over the Sheep.
Thanks to the pains taken by his gossip the Fox, a friendly word had
been spoken about him to the Lioness.</p>

<p>But, inasmuch as wolves have a bad name in the world, and in order
that it might not be said that the Lion shows favour to persons,
therefore orders were given to the whole animal kingdom to meet together
in a general assembly, and there to inquire on all sides what any one
knew, good or bad, about the Wolf.</p>

<p>The order was obeyed.  The animals were all convoked, and their
voices were gathered befittingly in the assembly.</p>

<p>Against the Wolf not a word was said.  So the Wolf was appointed to
preside over the sheep-fold.</p>

<p>But the Sheep?  What did they say?  Of course they were at the
assembly?</p>

<p>Well, it seems they weren't.  Somehow the Sheep had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>And yet it was they whose opinion was wanted the most.</p>

<h2 id="f119">THE TWO CASKS.</h2>

<p>THERE go two casks.  One full of wine, the other empty.  See how
silently, at a mere foot's pace, the first drags itself along; but the
other flies past at a gallop, with a sound of thunder from its banging
along the road, and a pillar of dust above it.  Hearing it afar off, the
passer-by hurries aside in fear.</p>

<p>But, noisy as that cask may be, there is not as much use in it as in
the other.</p>

<p>There is little real good in a man who never ceases telling every one
about his own performances.  He who is really great in deeds is
generally sparing of words.  A great man makes a noise only by what he
does, shaping in silence his firm resolve.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f120">THE FALSE ACCUSATION.</h2>

<p>THERE lived in the East a certain Brahmin, who, though fervently
orthodox in his words, was not so in his way of life.  Even among
Brahmins there are hypocrites:  but that is beside the mark.  This only
is to the point, that he alone of all the brotherhood was a man of that
kind.  All the rest were men of holy lives, and&horbar;what was, above
all things, distasteful to our friend&horbar;their chief was of an
exceedingly strict character, so that no one could ever venture to break
the rules.</p>

<p>But our Brahmin did not lose courage.  A fast-day comes, but he
meditates as to whether it may not be possible for him to obtain a
secret indulgence for something luscious.  Having laid his hands on an
egg, and having waited till midnight, he lights a candle and sets to
work to cook his egg above it.  Steadily does he turn the egg above the
flame, never takes his eyes off it, and already swallows it in
anticipation.  Meanwhile he thinks about his chief, chuckling to
himself,</p>

<p>"You won't find me out, my long-bearded friend!  This egg anyhow I
shall eat with relish."</p>

<p>But at this moment the chief suddenly enters the Brahmin's cell, and,
at the sight of such a sin, asks in a terrible voice what the Brahmin
has to say for himself.</p>

<p>The proof is there before his eyes:  it is too late to deny the
fact.</p>

<p>"Forgive me my sin! holy father, forgive!" the Brahmin implores
between his tears.  "I cannot tell what led me into this temptation.
Ah, yes! it was the accursed Evil One who put the idea into my
head."</p>

<p>But at that moment a little demon cried out from behind the
stove:</p>

<p>"What a shame it is to be always calumniating us!  Why, I myself have
just been taking a lesson from you; for, I assure you, this is the first
time I ever saw how to cook eggs at a candle."</p>

<h2 id="f121">THE FROG AND JUPITER.</h2>

<p>A FROG which lived in a swamp at the foot of a hill, changed its
quarters one spring, and went up the hill.  There it found a muddy
corner in a little hollow, and set up a small abode, like a tiny
Paradise, amidst grass and in the shade of a bush.</p>

<p>But it did not long enjoy itself there.  The summer came, and the
heat with it, and the Croaker's country seat became so dry that the
flies wandered about over it without wetting their feet.</p>

<p>"O ye gods!" prayed the Frog from its hole, "don't destroy poor me,
but send a deluge over the face of the earth as high as this hill, so
that the water may never dry up in these my domains!"</p>

<p>The Frog went on complaining incessantly, and at last took to
upbraiding Jupiter, and saying that there was neither sense nor pity in
him.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" cried Jupiter, who evidently was not in a bad humour just
then; "what pleasure can you find in croaking such nonsense?  Why should
I drown mankind for your whims?  Wouldn't it be better for you to crawl
down to your swamp again?"</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f122">THE EAGLE AND THE FOWLS.</h2>

<p>WISHING to enjoy a bright day to the utmost, an Eagle soared into the
upper regions of the air, and floated about in the birthplace of the
thunderbolt.  At length, having come down from those cloudy heights, the
King of Birds settled on a kiln for drying corn, and there took breath.
To be sure it was not a becoming perch for an eagle.  But kings have
their whims.  Perhaps he wanted to do honour to the kiln, or else there
was no object near, no oak, no granite rock, on which he could be seated
as became his rank.  What his fancy may have been I know not, but only
this, that he remained sitting there but a short time, and then flew
across to another kiln.</p>

<p>Having seen that, a tufted brood-hen thus chattered to her
gossip:</p>

<p>"Why are eagles so highly honoured?  It can't be for their flight, my
sweet neighbour.  Why, upon my word, if I felt inclined, I also could
fly across from kiln to kiln.  We won't be such fools in future as to
consider eagles of higher repute than ourselves.  They haven't more feet
or eyes than we have, and you yourself saw, this very moment, that they
fly close to the ground, just like us fowls."</p>

<p>Tired of listening to this nonsense, the Eagle replied,</p>

<p>"There is something in what you say, but you're not quite right.  It
sometimes happens that eagles stoop even below the level of barndoor
fowls, but never that such fowls soar into the clouds."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f123">APELLES AND THE ASS COLT.</h2>

<p>APELLES invited to his house a young Ass whom he happened to meet.
The very bones jumped for joy within the Donkey's frame, and it began to
bore the forest to death by its bragging, addressing the other animals
in such words as these:</p>

<p>"How tired I am of Apelles!  I find him a regular nuisance.  Why, I
never meet him but what he invites me to his house.  I suppose, my
friends, that he means to paint a 'Pegasus' from me."</p>

<p>"No," said Apelles, who happened to be close by; "but as I intend to
paint a 'Judgment of Midas,' I wanted to take your ears as a model for
his; and so I shall be glad if you will come to my house.  I've come
across a good many donkeys' ears in my time, but such splendid ones as
yours it has never been my luck to see possessed not merely by an ass
colt, but even by any full-grown ass."</p>

<p>[This fable is said to have been intended for the benefit of a young
author named Katenin, who, after the fabulist had twice asked him to his
house, went about saying that Krilof was boring him with
invitations.]</p>

<h2 id="f124">THE LION AND THE WOLF.</h2>

<p>WHILE a Lion was breakfasting off a lamb, a little Dog, which was
frisking around the regal table, tore away a small morsel from under the
Lion's claws; and the King of Beasts passed the matter over without
taking any offence.  (The Dog was still young and foolish.)</p>

<p>A Wolf, who saw this, took it into its head that as the Lion was so
patient it could not possibly be strong.  And so it also laid its paw
upon the lamb.</p>

<p>But it fared badly with the Wolf.  The Wolf itself got served up at
the Lion's table.  The Lion tore it asunder, addressing it thus the
while:</p>

<p>"You were wrong, my friend, to suppose, from what you saw the dog do,
that I should wink at your doings also.  The dog has not yet come to
years of discretion, but as for you&horbar;you are no longer a mere
cub."</p>

<h2 id="f125">THE RAT AND THE MOUSE.</h2>

<p>"NEIGHBOUR! have you heard the good news?" cried a Mouse, as it came
running in to a Rat.  "Why, they say the cat has fallen into the
clutches of the lion!  So you see even we shall have a quiet
breathing-time at last."</p>

<p>"Don't go making yourself so happy, my dear!" replied the Rat.
"Indulge in no such futile hopes!  If those two really do begin clawing
each other, believe me, it won't be the lion which will be left alive.
Than the cat there is no beast stronger."</p>

<p>Many a time have I seen what you may see for yourselves.  When
cowards fear any one, they think every one else sees in him what they
do.</p>

<h2 id="f126">THE BEE AND THE FLIES.</h2>

<p>TWO Flies determined to be off to foreign parts, and tried to entice
a Bee to go there with them.  They had heard from parrots high praises
of distant lands.  Besides, it seemed to them abominable that, on their
native soil, they should everywhere be excluded from hospitality, nay,
that it should even have come to this&horbar;(how is it people are not
ashamed of such things? and what oddities there are in the
world!)&horbar;that glass covers should have been invented to keep flies
away, and prevent them from profiting by the sweets on sumptuous tables.
And as to poor men's houses, why, there they found the spiders a
nuisance.</p>

<p>"A pleasant journey to you!" replied the Bee to all this.  "For my
part, I am comfortable even in my own land.  I have succeeded, by means
of my honeycomb, in gaining the affections of all, from the villager
even to the grandee.  But as for you, fly whither it pleases you:  you
will meet with the same fate everywhere.  As you are of no use, my
friends, you will nowhere be either honoured or loved.  There, as well
as here, it will only be the spiders who will be glad to see you."</p>

<p>He who toils usefully for his Fatherland will not lightly desert it.
But a foreign land is always pleasant to one who is destitute of useful
qualities.  There, as he is not a citizen, he is less despised than at
home, and to no one there is his idleness a source of vexation.</p>

<h2 id="f127">THE PEASANT AND THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>A SNAKE once glided up to a Peasant, and said, "Neighbour, let us
take to living on friendly terms.  You need not be on your guard against
roe any longer.  You can see for yourself that I have changed my skin
this spring, and that I have become quite a different creature from what
I was."</p>

<p>But the Snake did not convince the Peasant.  The Peasant seized a
cudgel, and cried,</p>

<p>"Though you've got a new skin, yet your heart is just the same as of
old."</p>

<p>And the neighbour's life was straightway knocked out of her.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f128">THE EAR OF CORN.</h2>

<p>AN Ear of Corn which shook in the wind afield&horbar;catching sight
of a flower which was fondled in comfort and luxury behind the glass of
a hothouse, while it was itself exposed to troops of flies, and to heat
and cold and storm&horbar;in a tone of vexation addressed its master
thus:</p>

<p>"How comes it that you men are always so unjust that there is nothing
you refuse to one who knows how to please your eye or taste, while you
are utterly careless about one who is practically useful to you?  Are
not your chief profits derived from the corn-field?  And yet, only see
in what contempt it is held!  Since the day when you sowed this piece of
ground, have you ever sheltered our blades under glass from bad weather,
or given orders that we should be weeded or warmed, or come to water us
in a drought?</p>

<p>"No:  our growth is left entirely to chance; whereas your flowers,
which can neither fatten nor enrich you, are not, like us, left out here
in the fields unheeded.  They grow up within glass walls, trimly tended
in a luxurious retreat.  Why, if you had only taken as much pains about
us instead, you would certainly have gained a hundredfold in the course
of a year, and would have sent to town a whole caravan full of grain!
Do think the matter over, and build a good big hothouse to hold us."</p>

<p>"Friend," replied the master, "I see that you have not paid attention
to my labours.  Trust me, my chief care has been for you.  If you only
knew what pains it cost me to clear away the forest, and to have the
ground manured for your benefit!  Why, there was no end to my toil!  But
I have neither time nor inclination to talk now, nor would there be any
use in my doing so.  As for wind and rain, address your requests to the
heavens.  But your wise advice to me would, if I had followed it, have
left me with neither corn nor flowers."</p>

<h2 id="f129">THE BOY AND THE WORM.</h2>

<p>A WORM begged a Peasant to let it go into his garden and spend the
summer there as his guest.  It promised to behave honourably, and not to
touch the fruit; to eat nothing but leaves, and those only which had
already begun to fade.</p>

<p>The Peasant thought, "How can I deny it a refuge?  Shall I feel
cramped in my garden because there is a worm the more in it?  Let it go
and live there.  Besides, even if it does eat two or three leaves, that
won't be a serious loss."</p>

<p>He consents.  The Worm crawls up a tree, finds a refuge from bad
weather under a twig, lives there, if not sumptuously, yet with all its
wants supplied, and no one hears a word about it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king of light had already gilded the fruits.  There, in
that garden, where everything else was fast growing mellow, an apple,
transparent, clear as amber, had fully ripened on a twig in the sun.</p>

<p>Now a Boy had long been enamoured of that apple, which he had picked
out of a thousand others.  But the apple was hard to get at.  To climb
the apple-tree the boy did not dare, to shake it he was not strong
enough&horbar;in a word, he could not tell how to get hold of the
apple.</p>

<p>Who helped the Boy to the theft?  The Worm.</p>

<p>"Listen!" it says.  "I know to a certainty that the master has
ordered the apples to be gathered, so this one won't stop here long for
either of us.  Still I can undertake to get it, only you must share it
with me.  But you may take even ten times more than I do for your share,
for a very little portion of it will take me a whole age to eat."</p>

<p>The Boy consented and the compact was made.  The Worm climbed up the
apple-tree, set to work, and gnawed away the apple in a moment.  But
what was the recompense it got?  No sooner had the apple fallen than the
Boy ate it up, pips and all, and when the Worm had crawled down to get
its share, the Boy crushed it under his heel.  And so there was an end
of both the Worm and the apple.</p>

<h2 id="f130">THE FUNERAL.</h2>

<p>IN Egypt, in the olden time, whenever people wanted to bury any one
in a very sumptuous style, it was the custom to have professional female
mourners to wail behind the coffin.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, at a grand funeral, a number of these mourners,
uttering loud howls, were escorting home a dead man who had passed from
this transitory life to everlasting rest.</p>

<p>Then a stranger, who fancied that in them he saw the whole family of
the defunct a prey to unfeigned woe, said to them:</p>

<p>"Tell me, wouldn't you be pleased if I were to bring him to life for
you?  I am a magician, and so I have the power of doing such things.  We
keep about us such exorcisms&horbar;the corpse will come to life in a
moment."</p>

<p>"Father," they all cried out, "pray give us poor creatures that
pleasure!  There is only one other favour we would ask&horbar;that he
may die again at the end of four or five days.  While he was alive here
there was no good at all in him, and there scarcely could be any if he
were to live longer.  But if he were to die, why, then, of course, they
would have to hire us to howl for him again."</p>

<p>[Krilof need scarcely have gone all the way to Egypt for his
"howlers."  Numbers of women earn a comfortable livelihood in Russia as
"crieresses," being employed not only at funerals, but also at
marriages&horbar;for the bride is expected to mourn freely at having to
leave her father's home, and pass from the state of "maiden liberty" to
that of married subjection, and the "crieress" is invaluable as
prompting her with the wailings appropriate to the occasion.]</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f131">THE COUNCIL OF THE MICE.</h2>

<p>ONCE upon a time the Mice took it into their heads to glorify
themselves, to spread abroad the fame of their deeds from the cellar to
the attic, and, in spite of cats, male and female, to drive cooks and
housekeepers out of their senses.</p>

<p>And to this end it was resolved to convene a council, in which those
only should be allowed to sit whose tails were as long as the rest of
their bodies.</p>

<p>It is acknowledged among mice that the longer a mouse's tail is, the
wiser he is sure to be, and the quicker in everything.  Whether this be
true or not we will not inquire at present.  We ourselves, for the
matter of that, often judge of a man's wisdom according to the cut of
his dress or his beard.</p>

<p>But you must know that by general consent it was decided that only
long-tailed members should be admitted into the council.  As for those
who unfortunately had no tails, although they might have lost them in
battle, yet, inasmuch as such loss is a sign of folly or carelessness,
they should not be admitted into the council, in order that mice should
thereby be deterred from losing their tails through their own fault.</p>

<p>Everything was duly arranged; it was proclaimed that the assembly
would be held as soon as it was night, and finally the sitting was
opened in a meal-bin.</p>

<p>But, as soon as the seats had been taken, there sat a rat without a
tail!</p>

<p>A young Mouse, who saw that, turned to a grey-haired Mouse, and
said,</p>

<p>"What right has that tailless one to sit here with us?  What has
become of our regulation?  Call out that he may be expelled at once!
You know that our people don't like the tailless.  And is it likely that
we could find of a use to us one who had not managed to save even his
own tail?  Why, he will be the ruin not only of us, but of the whole
under-floor population."</p>

<p>But the old Mouse replied,</p>

<p>"Hush!  I know all that; but that rat is my gossip."</p>

<p>[La Fontaine's fable, "Le Conseil tenu par les Rats," was translated
by Khvostof, under the title adopted in the present case by Krilof,
<i>Sovyet Muishei</i>; but the two fables have nothing else in common.
The rat most probably represents some great man who, although
disqualified for office, assumed it in an assembly of smaller people.
But what his name was does not appear.]</p>

<h2 id="f132">THE LAMB.</h2>

<p>A LAMB, which from sheer folly had donned a wolf's skin, went to the
sheep-fold, there to strut about in it.  The Lamb wanted merely to show
itself off a little, but the dogs which saw the foolish animal thought
that a wolf had broken in from the forest.  In they leaped, rushed at
it, knocked it off its feet, and tore it almost to pieces before it
could collect its scattered wits.  Luckily the shepherds recognized it
and rescued it.</p>

<p>But it is no joke to be even for a time exposed to the teeth of dogs.
After such a fright as this the poor creature could scarcely drag itself
to the sheep-fold, and after it had got there its strength began to
desert it, so that before long it became a perfect wreck, moaning away
without cessation for the rest of its life.</p>

<p>But if the Lamb had been wise, it would have been afraid of becoming,
even in fancy, like unto a wolf.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f133">THE PEASANT AND THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT and a Snake became bosom friends.  It is well known that
snakes are clever, and this one had so crept into the Peasant's good
graces, that he swore by it, and by nothing else.  From that time
forward, of all his former friends and relatives, not one would stir a
foot towards him.</p>

<p>"But why," says the Peasant, reproachfully, "why have you all
forsaken me?  Is it that my wife hasn't known how to receive you? or
have you become tired of what I have to offer you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied his gossip Matvei.  "We'd come and see you with
pleasure, neighbour; and you've never&horbar;not a word can be said
against that&horbar;never once vexed or angered us in anything.  But
just tell me, what pleasure can one find in your house if, while one's
sitting there, one can think of nothing but looking out that that friend
of yours doesn't crawl up and sting some one?"</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f134">THE SPIDER AND THE BEE.</h2>

<p>A MERCHANT brought some linen to a fair.  That's a thing everybody
wants to buy, so it would have been a sin in the Merchant if he had
complained of his sale.  There was no keeping the buyers back:  the shop
was at times crammed full.</p>

<p>Seeing how rapidly the goods went off, an envious Spider was tempted
by the Merchant's gains.  She took it into her head to weave goods for
sale herself, and determined to open a little shop for them in a window
comer, seeking thereby to undermine the Merchant's success.</p>

<p>She commenced her web, span the whole night long, and then set out
her wares on view.  From her shop she did not stir, but remained sitting
there, puffed up with pride, and thinking, "So soon as the day shall
dawn will all buyers be enticed to me."</p>

<p>Well, the day did dawn.  But what then?  There came a broom, and the
ingenious creature and her little shop were swept clean away.</p>

<p>Our Spider went wild with vexation.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried, "what's the good of expecting a just reward?  And
yet I ask the whole world&horbar;Whose work is the finer, mine or that
Merchant's?"</p>

<p>"Yours, to be sure," answered the Bee.  "Who would venture to deny
the fact?  Every one knew that long ago.  But what is the good of it if
there's neither warmth nor wear in it?"</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f135">THE FEAST.</h2>

<p>ONCE, during a year of dearth, the Lion prepared a rich feast as a
means of general consolation.  Couriers and heralds were sent out to
invite the guests&horbar;the animals both small and great.</p>

<p>From all sides they crowd together on the invitation to the Lion's
abode.  How could such an invitation possibly be refused?  A feast is a
good thing even at a time which is not one of dearth.</p>

<p>Well, there came among others a Marmot, a Fox, and a Mole; only they
came an hour after the proper time, and found that the guests were
already at table.  The Fox, unluckily, had had its hands full of
business; the Marmot had lost a great deal of time in getting up and
washing itself, and the Mole had lost its way.  However, none of them
were inclined to go home empty, so, spying a vacant place near the Lion,
all three tried to make their way to it.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, brothers!" said the Panther to them; "there is plenty of
room there, only it isn't intended for you.  The Elephant is coming
there, and he will turn you out; or, worse still, will squeeze you to
death.  So if you don't want to go away hungry, you will stop there on
the threshold.  You will get your fill, and that's a thing to thank God
for!  The places in front are not for the like of you.  They're kept for
animals of a large size only; but those of the little ones who don't
like to eat standing, had better keep their seats at home."</p>

<p>[This fable was not printed till 1869, when it appeared for the first
time in a collection of essays, etc., about Krilof, published at St.
Petersburg by the Imperial Academy of Sciences.  Appended to the MS. was
the following note by a daughter of Krilof's friend and patron,
Olenine.&horbar;"At the time when this fable was written by Krilof, the
censors would not allow it to be printed."]</p>

<h2 id="f136">THE PEASANT AND THE DOG.</h2>

<p>A PEASANT, who was a great economist, and the possessor of a
well-to-do homestead, hired a Dog to watch his courtyard and bake his
bread, and, besides all this, to hoe and water his young cabbages.</p>

<p>"What stuff is this he's made up?" says the reader.  "There's neither
rhyme nor reason in it!  Let's suppose the Dog watched the courtyard.
Good!  But has any one ever seen dogs baking bread or watering
cabbages?"</p>

<p>Reader!  I should not have been altogether justified if I had
answered in the affirmative.  But the matter in question is not that,
but this&horbar;that our Barbos undertook to do all these things, and
demanded and got triple pay in consequence.</p>

<p>For Barbos this was capital.  What did any one else matter?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Peasant got ready for the fair, went to it, amused
himself there for a time, and then came home again.  At his first glance
round&horbar;life became a burden to him; he tore and raged with
vexation.  There was no bread in the house, there were no cabbages; and,
besides this, a thief had slipped into the yard and stripped the
store-room bare.</p>

<p>On Barbos then burst a storm of abuse; but he had his excuse ready
for everything.  It was utterly impossible for him to bake bread on
account of having to look after the cabbages.  The cabbage-garden turned
out a failure merely because the constant guarding of the courtyard left
him without a foot to stand on.  And he had not observed the thief,
simply because he was at that moment preparing to bake the bread.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f137">THE MECHANICIAN.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN smart young fellow bought a big house; an oldish one, it is
true, but capitally constructed.  The house had every merit in the way
of solidity and comfort, and it would have been suited to his taste in
everything had it not been for this drawback:  it was rather a long way
off from any water.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," he thought, "I may do what I like with my own.  So I
will have my house, just as it stands, moved to the river by
machinery"&horbar;our friend, as you can see, had a passion for
mechanics&horbar;"I shall only have to dig under its foundations, put
runners under its walls, set it upon rollers, and then, by means of a
windlass, comfortably handle, so to speak, the whole building, and set
it down just where I like.  And what's more&horbar;a thing the world has
never yet seen&horbar;when my house is being moved, I will go in it to
my new place of residence, riding as if in a carriage, and feasting,
with friends around me, to the sound of music."</p>

<p>Bewitched by this folly, our Mechanician instantly set to work.  He
hired workmen, he dug and dug beneath his house.  Neither money nor
pains did he spare in the least.  But he could not manage to move his
house, and all that he attained to was this&horbar;that his house
tumbled to pieces.</p>

<h2 id="f138">THE MICE.</h2>

<p>"OH, sister! have you heard the terrible news?" said one Mouse on
board a vessel to another.  "The ship must have sprung a leak!  Down
below there, the water has risen as high as the very tip of my snout."
(But in reality she had scarcely got her paws wet.)  "And no wonder! our
captain is either drunk or suffering from the effects of drunkenness,
and the sailors are all each one lazier than the other.  In fact, there
is no kind of order anywhere.  I cried out immediately, and let every
one know that our ship was going to the bottom.  What was the use?  No
one lent me an ear, just as if I had been spreading false news.  But the
fact is plain enough:  one has only to look into the hold to see that
the ship has not another hour to live.  Surely, sister, it is not good
that we should perish with the rest?  Come, let us fling ourselves at
once from the ship!  Perchance the land is not far off."</p>

<p>With that our strange friends sprang into the sea, and&horbar;were
drowned.  But the ship, steered by a skilful hand, reached the harbour
safe and sound.</p>

<p>Now will come questions:  "But how about the captain, and the
sailors, and the leak?"</p>

<p>The leak was a little one, and besides, it was stopped immediately.
But the rest&horbar;was mere calumny.</p>

<p>[It is not clear to what this fable, which was first printed in 1833,
has special reference, but Trutofsky's illustration of it will serve to
give an idea of its general meaning.  Two ladies of the landed
proprietor class are talking about the emancipation of the serfs.  One
of them has in her hand a copy of the famous decree of February 19,
1861, by which serfdom was abolished in Russia, and is evidently
whispering fearful forebodings into the ear of the other, who holds up
her hands in horror.  From a corner of the room a barefooted peasant
girl quietly watches the two terrified ladies.  The slaveholding Mice
evidently think that the ship of the State is sinking fast.]</p>

<h2 id="f139">THE FALCON AND THE CATERPILLAR.</h2>

<p>A CATERPILLAR was swinging to and fro on a twig to which it had
attached itself on the top of a tree.  A Falcon floating in the air
above it thus mocked and flouts it from on high:</p>

<p>"What toils, poor thing, must thou not have endured!  And what
profits it that thou hast climbed so high?  What freedom hast thou, and
what kind of independence?  Thou must always bend with the twig
whichever way the wind orders."</p>

<p>"It is easy for thee to scoff," answers the Caterpillar.  "Thou
flyest high because thou art stoutly built and strong in the wings.  But
it is not such merits as those that Fate has given me.  Here on this
height I hold my own simply because I am, fortunately, tenacious."</p>

<h2 id="f140">THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>A SNAKE begged Jupiter to bestow upon her the voice of a
nightingale.</p>

<p>"As I am," she says, "my life is hateful to me.  Where-ever I show
myself, all who are weaker than I am are frightened at the sight of me.
And as to those who are stronger, God grant that I may escape from them
alive!  No, such a life as this I can no longer endure.  But if I could
sing in the forest like a nightingale, then, exciting admiration, I
should obtain love and, perhaps, respect, and would become the life of
festive meetings."</p>

<p>Jupiter granted the Snake's request.  Not even a trace of her hideous
hissing was retained by her.  The Snake glided up a tree, chose a
resting-place upon it, and began to sing as beautifully as any
nightingale.</p>

<p>The birds flocked together from all sides, and would have perched
close by her; but as soon as they caught sight of the songstress, away
they all flew from the tree in a body.  Whom could such a reception
please?</p>

<p>"Is it possible you can find my voice disagreeable?" asks the Snake
with vexation.</p>

<p>"No," replies a Starling:  "it is sonorous, wonderful.  In fact, you
sing as well as the nightingale.  But, to tell the truth, our hearts
shuddered within us when we saw your sting.  To us it is a terrible
thing to be in your company.  And so I will say this to you, but not
with any intention of annoying you.  We shall be delighted to hear your
songs, only sing them at a little distance from us."</p>

<h2 id="f141">THE HARE AT THE CHASE.</h2>

<p>HAVING united in full force, the beasts captured a bear.  They
strangled it in the open, and then began to settle among themselves what
part each of them should get as his share.</p>

<p>But at this point the Hare, forsooth, clutches the bear's ear,</p>

<p>"Hallo! you squinter there!" they shout at him.  "Where on earth have
you come from?  No one has seen you during the chase."</p>

<p>"Really now, brothers!" answered the Hare.  "And who was it, if you
please, who drove him out of the wood?  Didn't I frighten him entirely,
and drive him, this dear friend of ours, right afraid to you?"</p>

<p>Such bragging was somewhat too palpable, it is true, but it had such
an amusing air about it, that the Hare was presented with a morsel of
the bear's ear.</p>

<p>[It has often been said that Krilof alluded in this fable to the fact
of Austria having joined the Allied Powers after they had overthrown
Napoleon, and then demanded her share of the spoil.</p>

<p>But this can scarcely be, as the fable appeared in the summer of
1813, during the heat of the war for the independence of Germany.  It is
very probable that subsequently, at the time of the Congress of Vienna,
the fable was quoted in reference to the acquisitive tendencies
displayed by Austria, and this may have given rise to the idea that
Krilof had that Power in view when he wrote it.]</p>

<p>SAID a Fox to a Peasant, one day:  "Tell me, my dear gossip, what has

he is always by your side?  You keep him in plenty and well cared for.
When journeying, you go along with him, and with him you constantly go
afield.  And yet, of all animals, he surely is all but the
stupidest!"</p>

<p>"Ah, gossip!" replied the Peasant, "this isn't a question of wisdom:
all that's mere stuff.  That isn't at all what I go in for.  What I want
is that he should carry me and obey the whip."</p>

<h2 id="f143">THE SHEPHERD.</h2>

<p>THE shepherd Savva had charge of a Seigneur's flocks.  Suddenly the
sheep began to disappear.</p>

<p>Our fine fellow is plunged in grief and woe.  Everywhere he goes
weeping and spreading abroad the news that a terrible wolf has
appeared&horbar;that it has taken to dragging the sheep from the fold
and pitilessly tearing them to pieces.</p>

<p>"And there's nothing wonderful in that," say the people.  "What pity
have wolves for sheep?"</p>

<p>So they take to watching for the wolf.</p>

<p>But how comes it that our dear Savva's oven can now boast of cabbage
soup with mutton in it, or say a sheep's side and <i>kasha</i><sup><a
href="#f143_1">1</a></sup>?  (He had been turned out of a scullion's
place, and sent into the fields as a shepherd, by way of punishment for
his faults:  so he kept a kitchen more like one of ours than a
peasant's.)</p>

<p>A great search is made for the wolf:  it is cursed on all sides, and
the whole forest is rummaged for it.  But not a trace of it can be
found.</p>

<p>Friends, your trouble is of no use.  About the wolf it's all mere
talk.  The real devourer of the sheep is&horbar;Savva.</p>

<p><sup id="f143_1">1</sup> A favourite dish made of buckwheat.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f144">THE CARP.</h2>

<p>A NUMBER of carp dwelt in the clear spring-water of a lake in a
Seigneur's garden.  In shoals they used to sport near the banks, and all
their days, it seemed, went by like days of gold.</p>

<p>But suddenly the Seigneur orders a number of pike to be put in the
pond with them.</p>

<p>"Excuse me!" says a friend of his, who heard of that, "excuse me, but
what can you be intending to do?  What good thing can ever come of a
pike?  Not a fin will be left of the carp to a certainty.  Can it be
that you don't know how voracious pike are?"</p>

<p>"Don't waste your words," smilingly answers the Seigneur.  "I'm well
aware of all that.  But I should like to know what makes you think that
I am fond of carp?"</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f145">THE HIGHWAYMAN AND THE WAGGONER.</h2>

<p>ONE day, towards nightfall, a Highwayman was lying in wait for booty
in a thicket, at a little distance from a road.  And as a hungry bear
looks out from its den, so did he gaze gloomily into the distance.</p>

<p>Presently he sees a lumbering waggon come rolling on like a wave.</p>

<p>"Ah!" whispers our Highwayman.  "Laden, no doubt, with goods for the
fair:  nothing but cloth, and damask, and brocade, to a certainty.
Don't stand gaping at it:  there you'll get wherewithal to live.  Ah!
this day will not be lost for me!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the waggon arrives.  "Stop!" cries the robber, and flings
himself upon the driver, cudgel in hand.  But, unluckily for him, it was
no mere lubberly lad he had to do with.  The Waggoner was a strapping
youth, who confronted the malefactor with a big stick, and defended his
goods like a mountain.</p>

<p>Our hero was obliged to fight hard for his prey.  The battle was long
and fierce.  The robber lost a dozen teeth, and had an arm smashed and
an eye knocked out.  But, in spite of all this, he remained the
victor.</p>

<p>The malefactor killed the Waggoner&horbar;killed him, and rushed upon
the spoil.  What did he get?  A whole waggon-load of bladders!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f146">THE RICH MAN AND THE POET.</h2>

<p>A POET lodged an action against an exceedingly rich man, and
entreated Jupiter to take his side.  Both parties were ordered to appear
in court.  They came:  the one lean and hungry, barely clothed, barely
shod; the other all over gold and all puffed up by conceit.</p>

<p>"Take pity on me," cries the Poet, "O Ruler of Olympus!
Cloud-compeller, hurler of thunderbolts! in what have I sinned before
thee, that from my youth upwards I have endured the cruel persecutions
of Fortune?  No spoon is mine to feed from, no comer to lie in, and all
my possessions exist in fancy alone.  Meanwhile my rival, who has
neither mind nor merit, has been living in palaces surrounded by a herd
of worshippers, just as if he were an idol of thine, and swimming in the
fat of luxurious delicacy!"</p>

<p>"But is it nothing," replied Jupiter, "that the sounds of thy lyre
will resound to a distant age, while he will not be remembered by his
grandsons, not to speak of his great-grandsons?  Didst not thou thyself
choose glory as thy share?  To him I gave the good things of this world
during his lifetime.  But, believe me, if he had understood things
better, and if his mind could possibly have appreciated his
insignificance compared with thee, he would have grumbled at his lot
more than thou art grumbling at thine."</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f147">THE SNAKE AND THE LAMB.</h2>

<p>A SNAKE lay beneath a log, and raged against the whole world.  It had
no other feeling in it than that of rage.  Of such a kind had Nature
created it.  Hard by there bounded and frolicked a Lamb:  it never even
so much as thought about the Snake.</p>

<p>But see! the Snake comes gliding up and strikes its fangs into the
Lamb.  The sky grows dark before the poor thing's eyes, and the poison
turns all its blood into fire.</p>

<p>"What harm have I done thee?" it says to the Snake.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" hisses out the Snake.  "It may be that thou hast stolen
hither to crush me.  It is by way of precaution that I punish thee."</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" replies the Lamb&horbar;and then its life deserts it.</p>

<p>One whose heart is so framed that it knows neither friendship nor
love, and nourishes only hatred towards all men, such a one considers
every man his enemy.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="f148">THE NIGHTINGALES.</h2>

<p>A CERTAIN birdcatcher one spring had caught a number of Nightingales
in the copses.  The songsters were put in cages, and they began to sing,
although they would much rather have been wandering at will through the
woods.  When one sits in prison, has one a mind for song?  But there was
nothing to be done; so they sang, some from sorrow, and others to pass
the time.</p>

<p>One poor wretch among the Nightingales endured more suffering than
any of the others.  He had been taken from his mate:  to him confinement
was most grievous.  Through his tears he looked out afield from his
cage; day and night did he sorrow.</p>

<p>At last he thinks "Grief cures no evil.  Only fools weep on account
of misfortunes; the wise seek for the means of working out relief from
their woes.  I, too, methinks, will be able to fling this weight of
calamity off my neck.  Surely we cannot have been caught for eating.
Our master, I can see, likes to hear singing.  So if I do him a service
by my voice, it may be that it will bring me my reward, and he will put
an end to my captivity."</p>

<p>So thought our minstrel, and began to sing.  With song he glorified
the evening glow, and with song he greeted the rising of the sun.  But
what finally came to pass?  He thereby only aggravated his hard fate.
For the birds who sang badly their master has long ago opened wide both
cage and window, letting them all go free.  But as to our poor
Nightingale, the more sweetly, the more tenderly it sings, the more
strictly is it looked after.</p>

<p>[Trutofsky's illustration of this fable represents the interior of a
Government office.  It is closing-time, and the ordinary clerks are
getting ready to leave.  The model clerk still sits at his table with a
gloomy expression on his face.  His chief is handing him a thick bundle
of documents.  The good singer is being kept in his cage.]</p>
