<p>DEDICATION</p>

<p>TO</p>

<h3>MATTHEW TRUEMAN.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>MY DEAR MATTHEW:&mdash;</p>

<p>IF gifts were weighed by the intentions of the donor, the humble
offering which I here make to you, would be accounted equal
to the proudest gift that ever one poor mortal bestowed upon another.
To you, who so well know the love that I bear you, such
a declaration is altogether gratuitous, but I am unwilling that the
public should think that I make the dedication of so trifling a work
as this, to one who is worthy of having the highest efforts of genius
inscribed with his name, thinking that it is entitled to so great
an honor.</p>

<p>Your partiality for the author, my dear Matthew, will no doubt
blind your eyes to the defects of this book, which are painfully
obvious to himself.  But with all your partiality for me, and your
abounding good feeling for all the world, it will be necessary for
you to bear in mind that the story was written day by day, in the
midst of more pressing duties, to meet the exigencies of a weekly
paper, and that the present volume does not fully develop the design
of the author, which will be completed in another volume of
the same size.</p>

<p>You will not object to this manner of publishing a story by instalments,
for if it be worth publishing at all, a part will be more

<!-- Volume I, Page iv -->

acceptable than none; and if it prove not worthy of publication,
the half will be much better than the whole.  Moreover, it is the
fashion in literature to make two bites to a cherry, and the greatest
fictions that have been given to the public, were published in
this manner.  I have been extremely pained to learn, my dear
Matthew, that several excellent people, for whom I entertain
the highest regard and esteem, imagine that I have drawn their
portraits in these pages; but you know how incapable I am of doing
aught that could give a moment's pain to a human being.  I
would as soon strike a friend with my hand, as to prick an acquaintance
with my pen, and I can see no great difference between
wounding the feelings and wounding the flesh, excepting that I
regard the first as more humane and less wicked than the last.  All
that I have aimed at, was to embody certain peculiarities of humanity
in developing the great moral lesson which it is my design to
teach in this story; and it, in so doing this, I have unwittingly touched
a tender spot in any of my accidental acquaintances, you, at least,
will believe me when I say that I am heartily sorry for it.  There
is but little danger that every human being will have as many
hard rubs in his way through the world as the most malignant
heart could wish to befall an enemy; why then should we inflict a
needless pain upon another?  I know that you would not, and trusting
that you believe I would not, I subscribe myself,</p>

<p>With admiration of your genius,<br/>

And love of your virtues,<br/>

Your friend,<br/>

<p>IT is generally believed that mankind are blind to their own defects,
and for that reason that artists are incapable of drawing correct
likenesses of themselves.  But this is an error. If men did
not see their own faults, they would not take such pains to hide
them.  No lady with a red head, ever thought it black, or brown,
or flaxen; no dumpy gentleman ever believed himself to be six
feet high.  It is true that a lady cannot hide her head, because it
happens to be of a scarlet color, neither can a gentleman hide himself
because he happens to be dumpy.  But the first will dye her
hair with a tricopherous compound, and the other will do his best
by high-heeled boots to elevate himself in the eyes of the world.
Ladies who are naturally snappish will be at infinite pains to appear
in public with smiles on their faces; if their figures lack a becoming
rotundity they will endeavor to save appearances by the aid
of a little cotton or by some other artifice: if they are older than
they wish to be, they will deface the family record, that the important
truth may be known to none save themselves.  The propensity
to disguise personal characteristics is quite as strong in the other
sex, who have the same keen perception of their own deficiencies.
If a gentleman loses his hair, he covers up the fact with a wig; if

<!-- Volume I, Page 4 -->

his beard is grey, he shaves it off; if he is in straitened circumstances,
he makes a show of spending money, lest he should be
thought poor: if he is a tyrant in his family, he will take particular
pains to seem amiable to his wife and children before company,
and if he is knavish in his disposition, with a strong tendency to
overreach his neighbors, he will join a church that he may not be
thought a cheat.  All these facts, which every reader of mature
age knows to be true, prove that mankind do know themselves
very thoroughly, and are quite competent to the task of delineating
their own character, if they have but the honesty to do it.</p>

<p>As for myself I have two motives for being true to myself in
presenting my memoirs to the public; in the first place, I am thoroughly
known to all of those whose good opinions I covet, and any
departure from the truth would gain me more contempt from them,
than the increased favor which a flattering likeness of myself
might gain from a stranger, would compensate; secondly, I have
a pride in my own individuality, for if I were not myself I should
be nobody, and I would rather be what I am than not be at all.</p>

<p>J. J. Rousseau made a very thorough confession of himself, but
it has always appeared to me there was something lacking in his
portrait. A moral daguerreotype of character is still a desideratum,
which can only be filled by an autobiographist. The personages
of fiction are more true than those of history, because they
are consistent with themselves, which historical characters never
can be, for the lack of motives, which marvelously change the
complexion of actions. If you could know all of a man's actions,
you would know his character, but this is impossible, owing to the
keen instinct which leads most men to disguise their mean deeds.
It is evident, therefore, that the only true character is that drawn
by the autobiographer, because no man can know another so well
as he knows himself.</p>

Having made the above remarks, which have no particular pertinence
to my history, in place of the usual prelude to a novel beginning,
according to established rule, by describing, in detail, a
horseman, that might have been seen at the close of a wintry day,

<!-- Volume I, Page 5 -->

just emerging from the skirts of a dense forest, and so forth, I
will bring this chapter to an immediate close, and in the next
enter, without more ceremony, upon the performance of my task.

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>MY name is Tom Pepper, and I must caution the ladies and gentlemen
who propose making my acquaintance, not to call me
Thomas, for the sake of being genteel, because that is not my
name. Tom was the maiden name of my mother's mother, who
was the daughter of Major Thomas Tom, of Great Marshes, the
celebrated Revolutionary hero, whose exploits must be well known
to the reader; at least they were well known in that part of the
country where I was born. However, as it is my object to relate
my own adventures, and not those of my grandfather, I shall say
nothing more about him. But, perhaps, the reader will not like
me less for knowing I have revolutionary blood in my veins.
My mother's father was Major Pepper, and his name was bestowed
upon me at the time of my birth, owing to their being some doubt
of the real name of my own father, a circumstance which I learned
some years after that important event took place. I was one day
playing with some boys, in a neighbor's barn, when a man asked
me who my father was. It so happened that I had never been asked
the question before, and was rather put out by it, but I replied,
without much hesitation, that my grandfather's name was Major
Pepper. At this the man laughed, and I felt confused, without
exactly knowing why. But I ran home, and throwing myself into
my dear mother's arms, took her soft hand&mdash;oh! that I could feel
its pressure, now!&mdash;and asked her to tell me who my father was.
I had no sooner pronounced the words, than she pressed me to her
bosom, with such violence, that I thought she would stop my
breath, and then, bursting into tears, she fell upon the floor, and
terrified me by her shrieks.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 6 -->

<p>But my grandmother came in and helped her to the bed, where
she was confined for many weeks. My poor mother never smiled
again, and I remember now that I never after looked up into her
face that I did not see a tear fall from her eyes, I was cautious
not to mention a subject in her hearing that gave her so much
pain; but my curiosity was excited in respect to my immediate
progenitor, and feeling that I had a right to know something about
him, I kept teazing my grandfather whenever I found him alone,
until I learned that I was born at the close of the last war with
England, in something less than a year after the landing of a
party of frolicsome Midshipmen in the neighborhood of Apponagansett,
who belonged to the British frigate Endymion, which
was blockading the Sound. These young officers, it appears
came ashore near my grandfather's house on the pretense
of buying eggs and poultry, and finding themselves well treated
by the inhabitants of Apponagansett&mdash;who had always been opposed
to the war and were rather favorably inclined to the British, as
they left a good deal of gold behind them whenever they came
ashore&mdash;concluded to spend the night and have a dance. Women,
I believe, have always been fond of gold lace, particularly when
it is worn by a handsome young fellow with a sword by his side;
and perhaps the ladies, if no body else, will not deem it unpardonable
in my mother, who was young and beautiful herself, for falling
in love with one of the Endymion's handsome officers. I must be
excused for dropping this delicate subject; I cannot say more with
propriety, and the reader will not probably be satisfied with less.</p>

<p>The town or village of Apponagansett, in which I was born, is a
little rocky spot somewhere in Buzzard's Bay. I have never seen
it named on the map of North America, and I am not sure that it
can be found in any gazetteer; it was one of the most beautiful
places in the world, and I love it very much; but I have never
returned to it since I first left it to seek my fortune, and it is not
unlikely that it would look very different to me now from what it
did when I used to climb the rocks and fish in the transparent waters&mdash;a
shoeless and thoughtless boy.

<!-- Volume I, Page 7 -->

<p>It was not many months after the occurrence of the scene which
I have related, with my mother, when feeling sick one day, I crept
into her bed and lay down by her side. She pressed me to her
bosom again&mdash;but very gently, for she had grown quite weak&mdash;and
said, "Oh, my poor fatherless boy, how can I part with you?"
But I&mdash;never having dreamed that one I loved so well could die&mdash;said
to her, "do not cry, mother&mdash;I will not leave you&mdash;I am
not going to die." This only caused her to weep the more, and
they wanted to remove me from her; but she would not let them,
and I fell asleep in her arms. When I awoke it was dark, and all
was still, I turned to kiss my mother, and was frightened on
touching her cold lips. I spoke to her, but she made no answer.
I cried for help, and in a moment some body came with a light,
and I saw that I was an orphan. Ah, me!</p>

<p>The next year my grandfather died, and my grandmother soon
followed him and left me alone in the world. After this nobody
kissed me and patted me on the head; one of the neighbors suffered
me to eat in his house, but I yearned for something more than
Indian dumplings and a garret. I wanted to feel the warmth of
a loving hand, and the music of a reproving voice; they who
cared nothing for me never reproved me. I used to wish that
somebody would scold, or whip me, that I might know I was cared
for. But there was nobody to take any trouble about me now,
and I went wherever I liked, spending nearly all my time on the
shore, fishing from the rocks, and diving into the clear depths of
the cool water that flowed into the little harbor. Then there were
bird's nests to plunder, and berries to pick, and clams to dig, and
wild flowers to gather, so that I never was at a loss for amusement
and I was always happy and cheerful, with a good appetite and an
entire absence of bad dreams. Sometimes I used to steal away to
the little rocky enclosure where my mother and grandparents
were buried, and lie down by their graves and cry. But it was
not in my nature to despair; I was as free as a bird, and more
careless, for I had no nest to feather and nothing to fear. There
was plenty of sun-shine and good fresh air in Apponagansett, and

<!-- Volume I, Page 8 -->

as I never saw a scarcity of Indian dumplings I think there must
have been plenty of meal, I am sure that I never saw anything to
the contrary. I believe there was no school there, or if there was
I never entered it; by some means or other my poor mother had
contrived to teach me the art of reading, but I had never practiced
it to any great extent, and my book-knowledge was exceedingly
limited. If the Edinburg Review had put that tremendous question
in my hearing, "who reads an American book?" I could
have answered plumply. "Not I, for one," little dreaming that
the time would arrive when, if it should be asked, "who writes
an American book?" I could reply in the affirmative!</p>

<p>One day when I was fishing from the rocks and looking out
upon the bay, wondering what kind of a world it was that lay beyond
the line of my vision, or whether, indeed, there were a world
there at all, a stately vessel came drifting into the harbor, for it
was quite calm, and dropped her anchor, to wait for the turn of the
tide, or for the wind to spring up. The appearance of this vessel,
a large schooner, with a topsail, awakened the liveliest curiosity
in me to know where she came from, whither she was bound, and
what kind of beings peopled her. While I sat looking wishfully
at her, a plank came drifting by and seemed to invite me to bestride
it, which I instantly did, and using a stick for a paddle, I contrived
to reach the strange vessel. The tide was running rapidly and
as I caught hold of a ring-bolt in the schooner's side my plank
drifted and left me hanging by the arms. I was afraid to cry for
help, so I exerted myself and succeeded in climbing upon deck
and found it deserted. The crew were all below in the cabin eating
their dinner. When I looked back to the shore and saw that
all retreat was cut off, I was terribly frightened and knew not
what to do. I thought if the crew saw me they might throw me
overboard, or flog me, and when I heard them coming out of the
cabin, I jumped down into the forecastle, where I saw nobody
and covered myself up under a blanket in one of the berths.
Soon after I heard them raising the anchor, and then I know by the
motion of the vessel that she was under way. I thought of my

<!-- Volume I, Page 9 -->

poor mother's grave, which I never expected to see again, and
wished myself back on the rocks, but the pitching of the schooner
and the close air of the forecastle brought on a horrid sickness
which drove all thoughts out of my head. I lay trembling in my
uncomfortable hiding place until it was dark and the watches were
set for the night, the part of the crew whose turn it was to sleep
came down into the forecastle and lighted a large lamp which
hung suspended from the ceiling. There were three men and I
learned from their conversation that the schooner was a packet
bound from Boston to New York, and that they had contrived to
break open a box of merchandise belonging to the cargo, and had
secreted some small matters about their persons, of which they
began to divest themselves and stow them away in their chests.
After they had done this they sat down and began to sing songs
and tell stories. One of them said he would tell them a witch
story, but he didn't want to frighten them: the other two then insisted
that he should tell it and defied the Devil himself to frighten
them.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," said the sailor, "when my grandmother
was a girl, long before the Revolution, there was an old witch that
used to plague the whole neighborhood with her pranks. Ah,
those were the good old times when they had witches and everything,
now we haven't got anything worth having."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," said another sailor, "steamboats are
ruining everything."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the story-teller, "this old witch was one of
the ugliest hags that ever was seen, nobody would visit her, for
her husband was dead, and her children had all run away, and
how she lived nobody knew. She had a little old house that stood
all alone by itself, and the boys used to amuse themselves by
breaking her windows. She was wrinkled and crooked, and
would have been blind, if it hadn't been for a pair of great goggle
spectacles which she wore. When she went out to pick up chips,
she used to walk with a stick, pretending to be lame, but that was
the stick she used to ride upon, when she couldn't steal a broomstick:

<!-- Volume I, Page 10 -->

and many a time has she rode through the air, in the
height of a sou'-wester, when it has been thundering and lightening.
Once she set fire to a barn, in that way, by a thunderbolt,
and got ducked in a horse-pond. Once, when my grandfather was
going to sea, on a fishing cruise, she made a head wind for a whole
week by keeping a black cat under a wash tub, and once she spoiled
everybody's thanksgiving dinner by sending the soot down
the chimney, and got whipped for it at the whipping-post. There
was no end to the trouble the old hag used to bring upon the
neighbors, and everybody hated her, of course. One day my
grandmother was out in the fields, when she saw the witch gathering
herbs, and she said to her, go home, you old witch, but the
hag said she was only gathering some life 'lasting, and was doing
no harm to anybody. So my grandmother took up a stone, and
threw at her; the old witch pretended to be hurt, and said, 'you
will be sorry for this, one of these days.' Well, my grandmother
was terribly frightened, to-be-sure, for she knew that the witch
would do her some harm. So she went home, and nailed a horse-shoe
over the door, and never went to bed without putting a darning-needle
in her pillow, for they say that witches never pass under
or over steel; but my grandmother forgot the chimney.
Witches, you know, have always the odds in their favor, in a quarrel,
and if you cannot hang or drown them, it is always safest to
keep on good terms with them. This my grandmother found out
to her sorrow. A young fellow came a-sparking to her, one night;
he was the squire's son, and she thought she had got a great spec;
as they sat before the fire, a-courting with all their might, just as
he was going to pop the question, and she felt as sure of having
him as though they had been published three times in church,
down came the old witch through the chimney, in the shape of a
tremendous black cat, in a cloud of soot, and capsized both of the
lovers on the floor, and after scratching my grandmother's face
all over, vanished like a streak of lightning. The squire's son
was carried home in a swoon, and never had the courage to come

<!-- Volume I, Page 11 -->

back again. So my grandmother lost her beau just by throwing
a stone at a witch."</p>

<p>By this time my feelings had become so uncomfortable, that I
suffered a groan to escape me without perceiving it.</p>

<p>"What was that?" exclaimed the story-teller; "I vow I heard
a groan."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" exclaimed one of the sailors, "you are superstitious;
it was only the jib-sheet."</p>

<p>A dead silence ensuing, caused my hitherto inaudible breathing
to be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>"O, Lord! O, Lord !" exclaimed the story-teller, and without
more ado, darted upon deck, followed by his companions, who, in
their hurry, upset the lamp and left me in darkness. Finding
that I could no longer remain concealed below, I crept out of my
hiding place and climbed upon deck, dreadfully frightened, and
expecting to be thrown into the sea when they should discover
me. But when I emerged from the forecastle I did not encounter
one of the watch; they had all run after the frightened sailors,
who had gone to tell the Captain what they had heard. I crept
along the lee side of the vessel, and the night being dark, remained
undiscovered&mdash;while the Captain, with a lantern in his hand, and
followed by all the crew and passengers, went down into the forecastle
to investigate the cause of the strange noises that had been
heard, and which the frightened sailors had represented were
awful groans.</p>

<p>As soon as they had passed me, I stole softly along to the cabin,
and seeing it was empty, stepped down and crawled behind a pile
of mattresses which lay in one corner. This was a much more
comfortable hiding-place than the other, and I should soon have
dropped asleep had not the Captain and his two passengers
returned from inspecting the forecastle, and seating themselves in
the cabin, kept me awake by their conversation. The Captain
cursed his cowardly sailors, and the two passengers laughed at
their idle fears.</p>

<p>"This fear is a curious matter," said one of them.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 12 -->

<p>"Nonsense!" said the Captain; "I was never afraid of anything
in my life!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," replied the passenger; "but that is no proof
that you never will be. I do not know that I have ever been frightened
myself, but I can easily imagine circumstances and objects
which might cause fear."</p>

<p>"That's all stuff," said the Captain; "you are superstitious."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," said the passenger; "and that is the very
point that puzzles me. Why should I be superstitious? Why
should I be frightened without an adequate reason? Those
ignorant fellows in the forecastle thought they heard a noise;
but they knew a noise could not harm them&mdash;therefore they
should have searched for the cause of it; and if they had found
that it proceeded from some terrible object, then it would have
been time enough for fear."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Captain; "that is what I would have
done, only I don't believe that I should have been frightened, let
me have seen whatever I might&mdash;because its not in my nature.
I am not one of that kind."</p>

<p>"But suppose you were sitting in a secluded place," said the
passenger, "and should suddenly see a man's shadow on the
ground by your side, you would start with fear; but if you were
to turn deliberately round you might not be afraid, even though
the substance that cast the shadow were a terrible fellow. So
a man who could hear the roar of a cannon unmoved might be
terrified at the slightest sound breaking upon the stillness of
night, if he didn't know what caused it."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"I think you would," said the other passenger, "and you
needn't be ashamed to confess it. Fear is not cowardice. You
may encounter unmoved the greatest danger that can threaten
you, as death in any shape, and yet be frightened at a trifle,
merely because its exact magnitude is unknown to you. And
this convinces me that there is something somewhere in the
universe, more terrible than death or any ill that we know of,

<!-- Volume I, Page 13 -->

or whence comes this all-pervading instinct of fear which begins
in the cradle and follows us to the grave. There is some undeveloped
cause of fear somewhere, some terrible evil which the
imaginations of men have not been able to find a shape for, I am
certain, and therefore I do not hesitate to confess that I am afraid
at tines, but I know not why, and this ignorance of any cause
only adds to my fears instead of abating them. We know but
little yet of the world we inhabit."</p>

<p>"You are a coward," said the Captain, scornfully.</p>

<p>"No, no; I am not willing to admit that. I may believe in
supernatural powers and not be a coward," replied the passenger.
"Now let me tell you a little story.</p>

<p>"I was once travelling in Massachusetts with an old friend,
who had recently lost his mother. He had been a wild youth,
and perhaps her death might have been hastened by a report of
his indiscretions, for he was the youngling of her flock, and she
loved him very tenderly. We were travelling on foot, and one
morning just as the sun was rising, we entered a neat little
village and sat down by the side of a garden wall to rest. I
observed that my companion looked unusually grave, and that
tears were falling from his eyes. I asked him the cause of his
grief. 'This,' he replied, 'is the place in which I was born,
and on this very spot I took my last leave of my poor mother.
O, that I had never left her, or that I had heeded her parting
words.' Just at that moment, a clear, distinct, but mellow
sound was heard high above our heads in the air. It was unlike
any sound I had ever heard before, and I have heard none like
it since. I looked above and around, but I could see nothing.
There was not a breath of air stirring, nor a cloud in the sky. I
cast my eyes upon my companion; he was as pale as death.
'Did you hear that strange noise ?' I said. 'Yes,' he replied,
'it was my mother's voice.' "</p>

<p>I had listened so attentively to the passenger's story, that,
when he concluded, I involuntarily drew a long sigh.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the Captain, "I heard something."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 14 -->

<p>I sighed again, for in attempting to check my respiration, I
had become quite out of breath.</p>

<p>"I heard it again!" said the Captain.</p>

<p>"And so did I," said the two passengers. And without waiting
to find out the cause they jumped upon deck with the
Captain close upon their heels. Left to myself once more, I
crept from behind the pile of mattresses, and seeing a board
loose in the bulkhead which separated the cabin from the hold, I
shoved it aside and crept in, and stretched myself out upon some
cases of merchandize; although I was both sick and frightened,
I fell asleep in a very few minutes. But I might have remained
in the cabin in perfect security, for I learned afterwards that
neither the Captain nor his passengers would venture below until
the next morning, when they boldly jumped down the cabin
stairs and ransacked every corner in the cabin. The Captain
insisted that he was not at all frightened the night before, and
swore that if he were to meet the "old boy" himself, he would
take hold of his horns. The cowardly passenger said that for
his part he hoped they would arrive in port before night. But
the other one merely whistled Yankee Doodle and said nothing.
As the partition which divided the hold from the cabin was made
of thin boards, I could hear every word that was spoken. I was
greatly refreshed after a night's sleep, and there being but little
motion to the vessel, I felt very hungry. In crawling about the
hold I stumbled upon an open bundle of hard biscuit, from which
I made my breakfast. I had never been under restraint for so
long a time before, and I longed to be upon deck and see all that
was passing; but fear of a flogging kept me quiet, and I lay in
my hiding place until the night watch was again set, and I could
hear no one moving upon deck. Then I ventured to steal out,
and removing the loose plank in the bulkhead of the cabin, I
crept softly upon deck, and found the crew, helmsman and all,
sound asleep. It was a dead calm, and the motion of the waves
was just sufficient to move the rudder, so that it made a dismal,
creaking noise; the peaks of the sails were dropped, and the

<!-- Volume I, Page 15 -->

canvas hung like a dead weight against the masts. There was
a little piece of a moon, but it was very bright, and the stars all
shone out, as if trying to vie with the silver bow which hung in
the midst of them; and all their brightness and beauty were reflected
without a ripple to mar them in the smooth water of the
Sound; at a short distance, a small, but bright red light, glared
on the line of the horizon, and so noiseless was the night that I
could hear the faint dashing of the waves on the distant beach.
Familiarity with the ocean had not bred contempt in me. I had
that kind of fond awe for it which a child feels for a stern
mother; I had been accustomed to watch it under all its varying
aspects, and now I could not resist an impulse to view it in its
sleeping loveliness, while a host of heavenly beauties were resting
in its quiet bosom. Yielding to my feelings, and without
further reflection, I climbed up the shrouds of the main-mast and
seated myself upon the cross-trees with my arms around the
mast. Here I sat and looked about me, and felt very grand. I
felt indeed as though I were a companion of the stars; they did
not, in truth, seem to be above me, and I reached out my hand
as if to embrace them. Entirely forgetting myself, I opened my
throat and began to chaunt a song that I had learned of my
mother, hoping that she might hear my voice and would answer
me us the mother of the passenger's companion had done. But
no mother's voice responded to mine. I was heard, however,
by the helmsman on deck, who, roused from his slumbers by a
noise above his head, and seeing nobody near him, in his fright,
ran to the cabin doors and called all hands upon deck. The
Captain and his passengers jumped up in their shirts, and the
sailors came running aft to learn the cause of the tumult. The
helmsman gave the best account he could of the sounds he had
heard, and vowed there was a ghost on board the schooner, but
omitted to say anything about his having dropped asleep. The
Captain was about to administer a rope's end to the man's back,
when casting his eyes aloft, he discovered me sitting at the
mast head, and fell upon his knees, and began to exclaim,

<!-- Volume I, Page 16 -->

"O Lord have mercy upon us! O Lord, we are going to the
bottom!"</p>

<p>The mate of the schooner was more of a matter-of-fact person
than the Captain, so he ordered one of the sailors to go aloft and
see what it was at the mast head; but nobody offered to move.</p>

<p>"Blast your tarnal eyes!" said the mate, "why don't you
jump?" But nobody offered to jump; on the contrary, they all
huddled close together, and the Captain still kept upon his knees.</p>

<p>One of the passengers hinted to the mate, that as he was an
officer, it belonged to him to go up and see what the appearance
was; but the mate replied that he didn't ship to go aloft. He
threatened the sailors with a committal for mutiny, for disobeying
orders; one of them said that he had no fears for himself,
but as he had a wife and family dependent upon him, he did not
think it was proper to risk his life. Another of the men said the
proper course was to read a chapter out of the Bible, and his proposition
met with a very general approval, but upon inquiry it
was found that there was not a Bible on board.</p>

<p>"O Lord be merciful to me!" exclaimed the Captain, "I
turned a Bible agent out of the schooner the day before we left
Boston. O, Lord! I will subscribe to the Bible Society as soon
as we get into port, if we only do get there." One of the men
said that if he had a good stiff horn of rum, he thought he would
as soon go up as not. But the schooner was owned by a temperance
merchant, and they had no spirits on board. Notwithstanding
that I was elevated so high above their heads, I could distinctly
hear the chattering of their teeth. I remained as motionless
as possible, for their eyes were all turned towards me. The
Captain wrung his hands in great agony, and begged that somebody
would make a prayer. They all pleaded their extreme unfitness
for the duty, on the score of sinfulness and ignorance, except
the black cook, who was about to commence, when one of the
passengers, who was a southern gentleman, said he would rather
sink to the bottom than be prayed for by a nigger. The cook
said it was all the same to him; he thanked God, he had the

<!-- Volume I, Page 17 -->

privilege of praying for himself in spite of white folks. The
sailor who had told the witch story the night before, said he had
heard his grandmother say that you could shoot a ghost
with a silver bullet, upon which the mate said he would go
below and get the rifle, provided the captain would find the silver
for the ball. It was now my turn to be frightened. I had before
been more amused than alarmed, at what I had heard, but the
mention of the silver bullet was too serious a joke to laugh at, so I
made immediate preparations for descending to the deck. I
had no sooner begun to descend than the Captain called out to
clear the boat, but the men all ran forward, and the passengers
jumped into the cabin. The mate alone remained on deck,
standing by the Captain, who had prostrated himself and
covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"What in the name of Heaven do you come after here?" said
the mate, in a solemn voice, as I jumped upon deck.</p>

<p>This was a question, for which I had no answer, so I remained
silent.</p>

<p>"Who has murdered you? If it is either of the schooner's
crew, point him out," said the mate.</p>

<p>"Nobody has hurt me," I replied; "I only went up to the
mast head to look out."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"From home."</p>

<p>"From home?&mdash;and where is your home&mdash;in heaven?"</p>

<p>"No, I wish it was; my mother is in heaven."</p>

<p>"Is your home in hell, then?" said the mate.</p>

<p>"No; it is in Boston," I replied. I do not know what
prompted me to tell this lie, for I had never told one before.</p>

<p>"In Boston!" exclaimed the mate; "when did you leave there?"</p>

<p>"To-night," I replied; for having told one lie, I felt obliged to
tell another.</p>

<p>"How did you travel here?" asked the mate.</p>

<p>"I came on a plank," I replied.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 18 -->

<p>The mate had kept drawing closer and closer towards me as I
replied to his questions, and being within arms' reach he took hold
of my shoulder, and seemed not a little astonished at finding me
solid flesh and bones. The Captain seeing that the mate remained
unhurt, now got upon his feet, and the passengers and the crew
made their appearance from below. The end of the matter was,
that I confessed the truth, but got no credit for my sincerity, for
having told one lie, they could not, of course, decide which of my
stories was entitled to belief. The crew believed that I had got
on board by supernatural means, and the Captain and his passengers
concluded that I had secreted myself in the vessel's hold
while she lay at anchor at the wharf in Boston. A fair breeze
sprung up soon after I came down from aloft, and before the next
night we arrived at the dock in New York.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. BASSETT, one of the passengers on board the schooner, was
a merchant, a kind gentleman, remarkably handsome in his person,
and very gentle in his address; at least he appeared so to
me. When we arrived at the dock, he called me aside, and told
me that he would take me home to live with him, provided his
wife did not object to it. He gave me his portmanteau to carry,
and I followed him to his house, which was a long distance from
the vessel, and, as I thought, in a very disagreeable spot. It was
in the month of August, and the flagging of the side-walks almost
blistered my bare feet. I began to repent of my folly in leaving
such a delightful spot as Apponagansett, and determined to
embrace the first opportunity of getting back to my old haunts by
the sea side. The first glimpse of the city gave me a distaste for
a town life.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bassett reached his house, his wife came into the

<!-- Volume I, Page 19 -->

hall to meet him, but instead of welcoming him with a kiss, she
began to scold him for not coming sooner.</p>

<p>"I could not get here before, my dear," said Mr. Bassett, "the
vessel was becalmed."</p>

<p>"Then why did you not come in a steamboat?" said Mrs. B.
in a whining voice.</p>

<p>"Because, my love, you know that my physician advised me
to travel in a packet on account of my health."</p>

<p>"I hate your physician!" replied Mrs. Bassett; "he is always
advising you to go away from home. If you loved me you would
not listen to him. But what creature is that?"</p>

<p>"That, my dear, is a poor little fellow, who has got neither
father nor mother to take care of him, and I have promised him
that he should live with us."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hate such creatures!" said his wife; "you love
everybody but me; you are always bringing home some nasty
creature with you, on purpose to plague me. I won't have him in
the house."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear," said Mr. Bassett, soothingly, "he
must remain here to-night, and in the morning we will see what
can be done with him."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Bassett sent me into the kitchen, where the Irish cook
maid gave me some cold meat for my supper, and then led me up
a pair of long, winding stairs, into a little chamber, as hot as an
oven, where she told me I was to sleep. I did not like my apartment
in the least. It was much finer than the garret I had been
accustomed to sleep in, but not half so comfortable. But I did not
feel myself privileged to find fault with my accommodations, so I
threw myself upon the bed, and soon fell into a sweeter sleep than
I fear was enjoyed by Mr. Bassett, for unless he found some
means of soothing the temper of his affectionate wife, she probably
kept him awake until the next morning, merely to convince
him of the warmth of her love for him.</p>

<p>The rumbling of carts and other strange noises, awoke me,
early in the morning, and I got up and dressed myself long

<!-- Volume I, Page 20 -->

before a soul was stirring in the house. O! how I wished myself
back again in the poor but happy home I had left! What a contrast
did the hot and filthy street present to the clean, pebbly
beach, and the green fields to which I had been accustomed. I
rose from my bed, languid and weary, and experienced an indolent
sensation that I had never known before.</p>

<p>I was disappointed, too, in the appearance of the houses; I had
imagined that the streets of a great city were filled with magnificent
palaces, and all kinds of beautiful objects; nothing could be
further from my expectations than the reality. But a philosophy
that nature had kindly endowed me with&mdash;as if she had designed
to heap all manner of burdens upon my back, and so had furnished
me with extra muscle to bear them&mdash;would not allow me to
dwell long upon my altered condition; and when I was called to
my breakfast in the kitchen, I ate the remains of a broiled
mackerel and the whole of a loaf of broad which the cook gave
me, with a keen relish and a thankful heart. Indeed I could not
but feel that I was well treated, seeing that I had done nothing to
entitle me to the favor of my entertainer. Mr. Bassett left the
house as soon as he had swallowed his coffee, but he had hardly
stepped upon the flagging of the street when his wife called me
into the parlor.</p>

<p>"Come here, you dirty little beast!" said Mrs. B. "What's
your name?"</p>

<p>"Tom Pepper," I replied.</p>

<p>"Tom what?"</p>

<p>"Pepper."</p>

<p>"Pepper!" screamed the lady, "Pepper! Merciful heavens!
I won't have such a name in my house! Pepper! I'll pepper
you, you nasty wretch!" and to make her promise good, she slipped
off the shoe of her right foot, and struck me three or four
smart blows on the head. I beg the reader not to accuse me of a
want of spirit because I submitted quietly to such treatment, for
Mrs. B. being the first city lady that I had seen, I supposed her
conduct was according to custom; and, furthermore, as she had

<!-- Volume I, Page 21 -->

treated her husband but little better than she did me, I did not
really think I had any right to complain. I could not help dropping
a tear, however&mdash;not from the smart of the blows, but
because the strange behavior of the lady brought to mind the
gentle image of my mother, from whom I had never received
even an unkind word.</p>

<p>"Don't cry!" said Mrs. Bassett; "I will have no crying in
this house. Stop&mdash;hush up! You silly thing! What's your
father's name?"</p>

<p>I had felt the inconvenience of having this awkward question
put to me once before, and my first impulse was to invent a
name, but on a second thought I replied as before, "My grandfather's
name was Major Pepper."</p>

<p>"Your grandfather, indeed!" said Mrs. Bassett; "that's not
what I want to know; tell me your father's name."</p>

<p>I was sorely puzzled for a reply, and as the lady still held her
shoe in her hand, I acknowledged the truth, and said that I had
never had a father, and didn't know who he was.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Mrs. Bassett turned blue in the face and
trembled violently, so that I was very much frightened. I
couldn't conceive why she should take so lively an interest in a
matter so purely personal to myself, for whom she did not appear to
have much love. She sat and glared upon me a few minutes, and
then flew at me with such fierceness, that I tried to escape; but
she had caught me by the collar of my jacket, and held me fast.
This was an unpromising introduction into the world, and I
heartily wished myself back again in Apponagansett, and resolved
to embrace the first opportunity to escape from the hands of my
unmerciful patron. After giving me a severe shaking, and boxing
my ears until they tingled with pain, she locked the door of
the parlor, and made me sit by her on the sofa. First she made
me hold up my head and look her in the eyes&mdash;then she told
me to walk across the floor, which I did.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said, "I see it all. Now come here and

<!-- Volume I, Page 22 -->

answer my questions; and if you do not tell the truth I will
take your skin off. How old are you?"</p>

<p>I did not know my age, but I answered promptly, "Twelve
years and two months."</p>

<p>"Twelve years and two months," she replied, counting upon
her fingers; "yes, yes; twelve years and two months. I knew
it. Now tell me where your mother is."</p>

<p>"She is dead," I replied, bursting into tears at the mention of
her name.</p>

<p>"Dead&mdash;I thought so," said the lady&mdash;"just as I thought;
and my husband took you and brought you home, because there
was nobody to take care of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered.</p>

<p>"And how many times did he come to see your mother before
she died? Mind how you answer me!"</p>

<p>I was on the point of saying "Never," but as I hesitated, she
struck me with her shoe again, and being afraid that my reply
might in some way excite her wrath, I replied that "I did not
know."</p>

<p>"Ah! you little wretch!" she cried, and again made an
attempt to strike me; but now my temper was fairly roused, and
by a sudden jerk I escaped from her and got under one of the
tables, where I succeeded in defending myself for a time, but at
last was conquered and dragged out into the middle of the floor,
where I fought so stoutly that she let me alone and sat down on
the sofa again and cried a long time. She afterwards sent me
back into the kitchen, where the Irish servant treated me very
kindly, and called me a "poor craythur."</p>

<p>At three o'clock Mr. Bassett came home to his dinner, and I
was told by Bridget to go up stairs into the parlor. There I
found Mrs. Bassett with her hat on, and as soon as I entered the
room she said to her husband:</p>

<p>"There, sir&mdash;there is your brat; of course I have no right
to separate a father from his child&mdash;I don't wish to&mdash;it would be
cruel. I do not blame you&mdash;how can I? If you do not love

<!-- Volume I, Page 23 -->

me you cannot help it. The child must not suffer for his parent's
crimes&mdash;no, he must be taken care of and educated: I know
that, and I am not unreasonable. But I cannot live in the same
house with him, and you will be happier, far happier, when I am
gone. I am of no consequence in this world&mdash;I have long
known that you never loved me&mdash;I now feel it; but I have kept
all my griefs, all my sorrows, to myself. I will go to my
mother's, and you will live here and be happy with your son.
There are the keys, and here is my miniature&mdash;give me mine,
that you may never be reminded of me when I am dead and
gone."</p>

<p>"Jane," said Mr. Bassett, "you amaze me."</p>

<p>"Of course I do," replied the wife, turning to leave the parlor;
"you thought that I could bear everything because I never
complained of your conduct. I knew that you did not make
those long visits to Boston for nothing. Mother has always told
me so, and sister. I have been a poor, broken-hearted, suffering
creature, and now it has come to the turning point. The world
knows what I have suffered, and what I have sacrificed for you;
but I don't blame you&mdash;no, George, I don't blame you, for I
know you are fond of children, and if I had had any of my own
this wouldn't have happened. But it's my misfortune. Only
promise me that you will never think of me, or speak my name;
and when I die don't come to my funeral, or I shall rise from my
grave, I know."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, my love&mdash;&mdash;" said Mr. Basset.</p>

<p>"Don't call me your love! don't be a hypocrite, I beg of
you!" sobbed the lady, suddenly bursting into a hysterical fit of
weeping.</p>

<p>"I will call you anything that will restore you to your senses,"
replied her husband; "if you have no regard for me, for
heaven's sake have some for yourself. How can you distress
me by your ridiculous jealousies? Come, come my
dear, take off your hat and sit down, and let me convince you
how absurdly you have been acting;" so saying, he put his

<!-- Volume I, Page 24 -->

arms gently around her waist, and forced her to sit upon the
sofa.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" said the lady, yielding to him; "don't
pretend to care anything about me."</p>
<p>"I see what it is that has excited your feelings, and perhaps
you are not altogether to blame," said Mr. Bassett; "but I
swear, if there is truth in man, you wrong me cruelly by your
suspicions. Come here, Tom, and answer every question truly,
that I put to you."</p>

<p>He then made me repeat every particular of my discovery on
board the schooner, and promised to have the captain and crew
of the vessel to confirm my story. Mrs. Bassett protested that it
was all a lie made up between her husband and myself, and
insisted on going to her mother's to die; but allowed her husband
to take off her bonnet, and at last threw her arms around his neck
and kissed him. I was sent back to the kitchen, where Bridget
repaid me by her kindness for all the ill treatment I had received
from the mistress.</p>

<p>"Och! but the master is a jewel," said Bridget, "and the
misthriss is jist the torment of the poor craythur's life. All she
wants is a good basting, and more's the pity he won't give it to her."</p>

<p>Bridget was the first specimen of her class that I had ever
seen, and although her strange manner of speech repulsed me
at first, I very soon took a vehement liking to her, which she fully
returned.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Bassett had, for the present, concluded not to
go home to her mother and die, she had not abated a particle of
her animosity towards me, and as soon as her husband had left
the house to return to his business, she came down into the
kitchen to wreak her jealous fury upon me; but Bridget, suspecting
her motives, shut me up in a closet, and said that I had
gone out to play in the street. As soon as she was gone, Bridget
let me out, and set me to work cleaning her knives, telling me to
keep up a good heart, and she would learn me how to gain my
own living in any gentleman's family in the land.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 25 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>ALTHOUGH I was very willing to work for Bridget, and indeed
it gave me pleasure to assist her, I spurned the idea of being a
servant to anybody. There were no servants in Apponagansett,
and I hardly know what the term meant, excepting the practical
demonstration of it which I saw in Bridget. It seemed to me
that I was a prisoner in Mr. Bassett's house; the little yard
hemmed in by tall fences, and all prospects shut out by dingy
brick houses, a miserable street in front, paved with hot stones,
and a confined room in a hot garret, were a wretched change
from the sea beach, and hills and rocks to which I had been
accustomed all my life, and already I longed for my freedom.
Nothing more occurred that day. I saw neither Mr. Bassett nor
his wife, but the next morning after breakfast, he called me to go
out with him, and when we were in the street he laid to me, "I
will keep you, Tom, and educate you, and make a man of you, if
Mrs. Bassett is willing that you should remain in the house; but
you must never give her an unhandsome word, for she is a good
woman, only she has her little odd ways, as we all of us have."</p>

<p>To which I made no reply, for I had nothing to say, and he
continued. "I like you, Tom, because you seem innocent and
good hearted, and I have no children of my own to love and to
educate, and by-and-by I shall be old, and there will be nobody
to care for me. But I cannot love you if you are not good, and
above all things, truthful; for it is a dreadful thing not to regard
the truth in the smallest circumstance. Now, Tom, when
you were first discovered, you said that you got on board
the vessel at Boston, and afterwards, that you swam off on a
plank, while we lay at anchor at Apponagansett. You were
frightened, and told a lie, I hope, because you did not know
what you were saying; but you must never be guilty of such an
offence again."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 26 -->

<p>My face burnt with shame, and I thought that I would never
tell another falsehood, and so promised.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you never will," said Mr. Bassett, "for if you
once indulge in the habit of making false representations, even
though it be in the most trifling thing, you will be ruined.
Therefore, keep a watch upon your thoughts, and do not allow
yourself to think an untruth, for that would be as wicked as to
speak one. There are no degrees of comparison between truths
and falsehoods; all truths and all falsehoods are great. Accustom
yourself to speak truly always, for even though you were to
say you feel well when you feel ill, although it might seem like
a very trivial matter to you, something serious would grow out
of it. Your soul would be tainted with dissimulation, at least,
and you would be less able to resist the temptation to lie, when
it might appear to your advantage to do so. If, now, anybody
should ask you if you liked him, although it would appear unamiable
to say no, yet if you did not, you should say so. Then, too,
you should always let your thoughts appear in your countenance,
for that will be a caution to you not to harbor evil thoughts, lest
they should be seen, and your countenance will wear that expression
of ingenuousness which is worth more to a man than a
fortune, because he always carries a letter of recommendation in
his face, and will need no other bill of credit. Such kind of men
are always lucky, because they find friends wherever they go.
Now, if I should ask you what you thought of me, or how you
liked me, what would you say?"</p>

<p>"I would say I liked you very much," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, would you, indeed?" said Mr. Bassett, pressing my
hand. "And why do you like me? Of course we always like
or dislike people for some particular reason."</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied, feeling, in truth, rather sheepish.</p>

<p>"Have a care, Tom," he said; "you must know."</p>

<p>"Because you are good and handsome," I replied.</p>

<p>"What, do you think I am handsome, Tom?"</p>

<p>My face burnt with blushes to say so, but I thought I must

<!-- Volume I, Page 27 -->

tell the truth. Mr. Bassett was indeed a very handsome man.
His countenance was fair, his voice mild, and his whole manner
gentle and winning. He dressed himself with extreme neatness,
and I thought him to be the best man in the world.</p>

<p>"And, I suppose, you thought Mrs. Bassett handsome, too?"
he said.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" I replied, quickly.</p>

<p>We walked some distance further, without his saying anything
more. He hummed a tune as he went, and directly we
stopped at a clothing store, which appeared to me to contain all
the clothes in the world, it was so large. Here he bought me an
entire new suit, which made me feel very proud and very
uncomfortable. He asked the price of the articles, which he
bought for me, and the salesman demanded a price at first, from
which he afterwards made considerable deduction, although he
said at first that he would not fall, so I spoke out and said&mdash;"What
a liar he is!" because I thought so.</p>

<p>At first, the salesman was very angry, and threatened to flog
me, but Mr. Bassett defended me, and said I had only spoken
what I thought, and that the fault was his own, for saying, in the
first place, that he would not take less than a certain price, and
then falling from it. As we came out of the door, the salesman
said something about putting a beggar on horseback, which I supposed
was intended to apply to me. Mr. Bassett said I had done
all right, to say exactly as I thought, and hoped I would continue
to do so. He then asked me what I thought of the city, and if
the houses did not look very fine to me. I told him that the
streets were very dirty and narrow, and as for the houses, they
did not look to me half so pleasantly as my grandfather Pepper's
house in Apponagansett, and that I wished myself back there
once more. This seemed to surprise him. But I have generally
found that people who live in cities entertain extravagant ideas of
the splendor and magnificence of their residences, which is owing
partly to the common habit of judging of the excellence of a

<!-- Volume I, Page 28 -->

thing from its cost, and partly from their ignorance of the beauty
and attractions of a country life.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett commended my sincerity, and asked me several
more questions, all of which I answered with the same candor and
unreserve. At last we reached his place of business, which was
in Pearl street; he was a jobber in dry goods, and had a partner,
and employed a great many clerks; and I was quite surprised at
the beautiful merchandize with which his store was filled, and
thought it the largest and most magnificent establishment in the
whole world. Here I remained with him until late in the afternoon,
when we went home to dinner, and instead of being sent
into the kitchen to help Bridget in her dirty work, I was allowed
to sit at the table with Mr. Bassett and his wife. She took but
little notice of me, and I took no other notice of her than to keep
as far from her as I could, for my head was still sore from the
raps she gave me with the heel of her shoe. The dinner seemed
to me like a dream, it so much exceeded in elegance anything
that I had ever seen before. The fineness and glossy whiteness
of the table linen, the beautiful plates, which looked to me like
pictures, the silver castors, and cut glass ornaments, the delicious
meats and vegetables, the pudding, and its rich sauce, and the
ceremony of carving and helping, performed by Mr. Bassett,
with a graceful dignity of manner that I had never seen on such
an occasion, all made an impression on my mind that can never
be effaced. They gave me a taste for elegant refinements, or
rather awakened it in me, for I am sure I must have inherited it,
it came to me so naturally, and had so much influence on my
after life. I perceived at once the essential difference between
town and country, or rather between Apponagansett and New
York, and I at once resolved that the city and its elegancies
should be my portion of the world. It gave me a strange feeling
for a gentleman like Mr. Bassett, to say to me, in a pleasant
voice, "Tom, shall I help you to another piece of this kidney?"
or, "Tom, let me give you a piece of toast with your asparagus."

<!-- Volume I, Page 29 -->

Even Mrs. Bassett after she had helped me to some pudding
asked me if I would take more sauce.</p>

<p>All this magnificence and condescension filled my heart full
of pride, but still I could not help asking myself what I had done
to deserve it. But I readily discovered that Mrs. Bassett was
only acting a part in her kindness towards me, for when her husband
stepped out of the room, she immediately changed her manner
towards me, and called me a little wretch. I afterwards
went into the kitchen, and Bridget ran and caught me up in her
greasy arms, and vexed me by her kisses.</p>

<p>"Faith, Tom," she said, "but you've put yer fut in it;
indade but I shouldn't wondher if the masther made yer fortune.
Ah, yer a darlin', Tom. Faith an' troth yer a beautiful by.
Let me kiss ye agin."</p>

<p>But I would not let her kiss me again, and remembering what
Mr. Bassett had told me about speaking exactly what I thought,
I said that I did not like her because she smelt greasy.</p>

<p>"Ah, ye nasty beggar!" exclaimed Bridget; "out wid yez,
or I'll pour a ladle of hot water over ye! Go along, ye beggarly
spalpeen! Faith, Tom, but yez are in a fair way for the gallis.
Yez got no father, ye spalpeen!"</p>

<p>So I took myself from the enraged cook, and I was not sorry
that I had roused her anger, for she was hideously ugly; her
face was horribly scarred with the small pox, and she squinted
frightfully, and had red hair into the bargain. Mr. Bassett
having returned to his store, I was allowed to do as I pleased; I
sat down on the front door steps, and watched the people as they
passed, and wondered who they were, and what they were employed
about. At dark Mr. Bassett returned, and seeing me
upon the steps, asked me what I had been doing, and why I was
sitting there. I told him that I was waiting for him to come
back. He patted me on the head and said:</p>

<p>"And are you glad to see me Tom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I was in a hurry to see you," I replied.</p>

<p>He pinched my check, and said I was a fine fellow, and that I

<!-- Volume I, Page 30 -->

must always speak the truth, and say exactly what I thought,
and I would have nothing to fear. As he stood talking to me his
wife came to the door and said:</p>

<p>"You are breaking my heart, George, by your cruel conduct."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my love?" said Mr. Bassett, mildly.</p>

<p>"Matter!" said she, "to stand there talking to that impudent
little wretch, before you come into the house and speak to your
wife!"</p>

<p>So she began to cry, and he put his arm around her waist and
led her into the parlor. I did not follow them, but I heard her
scolding him and crying a long time. He sat silent for a while,
and then I heard him say:</p>

<p>"Jane, you will drive me mad. Tell me what I shall do to
please you. Will you allow me no freedom of will? Must I
be treated like a child, and not be allowed to love anything
nor anybody?"</p>

<p>"Love anything!" said his wife; "I do not see what right a
married man has to love anybody but his wife!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Jane," said Mr. Bassett, with some violence,
"how can you torment me so? I have renounced everything
that gave me pleasure, for your sake; you were jealous of my
old companion, Wimple, and I offended him to please you; you
suspected me of visiting my sister whenever I was detained by
my business at night, and I deserted her for your sake; you
would not allow me to caress my poor dog, Ponto, and I gave
him away to pacify you, although I loved the faithful beast like
a child; you quarreled with me for reading, and destroyed my
favorite authors; and now, when I have taken a poor child, who
has no one in the world to provide for him, with the hope of
training him to love us and be a companion for us, you quarrel
with me for speaking a kindly word to the poor boy."</p>

<p>"It's a disgrace to you," said his wife "to talk about loving
anybody else when you have got a wife, and you ought to know
better than to be taking people's children when there is an
asylum for the nasty brats. Goodness knows, if you have got

<!-- Volume I, Page 31 -->

any money to spare I want it myself. I am not dressed fit to be
seen."</p>

<p>"I can endure this no longer! I will be master of my own
house!" exclaimed Mr. Bassett, in a passion; "I have already
told you that the boy shall live here, and you promised to say
nothing more about him; but you have no feeling, no thought,
no love for me, and I will learn you, madam, that I will have
my own way; the boy shall not be sent away from the house,
and you shall treat him kindly." He then came to the door and
called me in. Mrs. Bassett had been crying during his speech,
but when he came to the door and spoke to me, she broke out
into terrible screams. He ran back to her, and, in a softened
tone, begged her to be quiet; then he kissed her and took her in
his arms, and called her his dear love, his darling Jane; but she
continued to scream and cry, and say that he had killed her
and broken her heart by his cruelty. At last he procured some
brandy and tried to force it down her throat, but she would not
swallow it, and then he promised her that I should be sent away;
upon hearing this she gradually hushed her screams, and ended
by falling upon his neck and calling him her dear George.</p>

<p>I must be pardoned for describing these disagreeable scenes;
they made such a painful impression upon my mind that I have
never forgotten them. I pitied poor Mr. Bassett very much, and
wondered why he did not give his wife a flogging. But I was a
mere child, and had never been taught how vile an offence it is
for a man to strike a woman.</p>

<p>It was one of the defects of my education to believe that the
only cure for misbehavior was a flogging. I had been flogged
myself often. I had seen mothers flog their children, and men
their wives; men flogged each other; and I had heard my
grandfather Pepper talk continually of flogging the British, and I
knew that officers in the navy flogged their sailors, having heard
shocking stories told by a young sailor in the neighborhood,
who had been on board a man of war, of punishment by a cat
with nine tails. A most terrific image to a young mind.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 32 -->

<p>After a while, Mrs. Bassett grew more quiet, and having been
persuaded to swallow a spoonful of brandy, she dropped her head
upon the sofa and fell asleep. I had crept quietly out upon the
piazza at the back of the house, for fear that she might be provoked,
in her rage, to make another attack upon me with her
shoe, which I had a great dread of, my head being still sore from
the effect of her blows. While I sat there Mr. Bassett came out
with a cigar in his mouth, and sat down by me. He smoked a
long time without speaking a word, but every now and then he
sighed deeply, and seemed to be very melancholy. After he had
smoked two or three cigars, he began to talk, and gradually
seemed to regain his customary composure and good humor.</p>

<p>"You see, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, "what I have to suffer on
your account."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, for I had seen it very plainly, and of
course was bound to say so.</p>

<p>"What can I do, Tom? I don't like to send you away, poor
boy, and I don't know how to pacify Mrs. Bassett."</p>

<p>"I know what I would do," I replied.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you would do, Tom."</p>

<p>"I would give her a good flogging," I replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett puffed away at his cigar and made no reply for
some time, and then patting me on the head, he said:</p>

<p>"That's right, Tom; always say exactly what you think, and
you will do well enough; but then you must always
endeavor to think rightly. Now, you thought very ill then,
although you did very right to let your thoughts come out,
because if you had not I could not have corrected your error.
Perhaps you may have been taught to repeat a little rhyme which
I learned when I was a boy, but which I have forgotten now;
but I remember the last line, "Your little hands were never
made to tear each other's eyes." You must try and remember
it. There was a time once when it was considered proper to beat
and maul each other. I hope that time is past; but there never
was a time, no, not even in the darkest days of the dark ages,

<!-- Volume I, Page 33 -->

when a man was justified in striking his wife; but in these days
a man is regarded as a brute who is guilty of so base an act.
Women, Tom, are our helpmates, companions and comforters,
and although they have their little ways, as you see Mrs. Bassett
has, they are sometimes very necessary to our happiness, and as
my grandmother used to say of certain bitter herbs, they are
excellent in sickness. You loved your own mother, of course,
Tom?"</p>

<p>I assured him that I loved her very much, and that she was a
different sort of woman to his wife.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mr. Bassett, "of course, all women differ.
But you must learn to love Mrs. Bassett, and then she will love
you."</p>

<p>I told him that I could learn almost everything, but I was
afraid that I should never learn to love her, but I would try.
Mr. Bassett then patted me on the head again, and told me I must
go to bed and rise early in the morning, as he wanted to see
about sending me to school.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>AT this distance of time, when I cannot be suspected of taking
any particular pride in my boyhood, I may be excused for speaking
with entire candor, of my appearance, as well as of my
thoughts and actions, for as the life of the boy is the foundation
on which the character of the man is erected, or rather the soil
out of which it grows, to thoroughly understand the one it is
necessary to have a knowledge of the other. The life of no man
would be a riddle, if his whole life could be known. The acts
of the greatest or vilest men never take their parents by surprise,
because they follow as natural consequences of early training, or
of early inclinations; and for myself I can look back and discover
the origin of all my trippings as plainly as though I were tracing
the course of a river from the summit of a high mountain.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 34 -->

<p>Until I left my native village of Apponagansett, I had bestowed
as little thought upon my personal appearance as though I had
been an oyster, and I do not remember that anybody had ever
told me whether I was ugly or handsome, the good people of Buzzard's
Bay caring nothing about looks, but thinking that behavior
was all. Since my entrance into the world of commerce and
fashion, however, I began to discover that nature had endowed
me with good looks, and my little heart had swelled with pride, to
hear people say, "What a pretty boy Tom is!" Then the fond
attention of Mr. Bassett helped to increase my admiration of
myself, and upon consulting the little mirror which hung in my
chamber, I discovered that I had a fair complexion, with a profusion
of brown, curly hair, a bright flush in my checks, a dimpled
chin, and a perfectly clean and even set of teeth. My health
was perfect, and my spirits always cheerful and gay, excepting
when I thought of my poor mother, or reflected that I had never
had a father. But these things never distressed me unless something
was said to recall them to my mind, and then I strove to
keep my feelings to myself. I saw that Mr. Bassett loved me,
and I thought I had nothing to do but to obey his instructions and
always speak the truth, and say exactly what I thought, to retain
his affection. So I was very cautious whenever I spoke to say
nothing different from what I thought, and I wondered that anybody
could lie when it was so much easier and pleasanter to be
honest and speak the truth.</p>

<p>I do not know what promises or arguments Mr. Bassett had
made use of to his wife, but the next morning she treated me
quite tenderly, and I thought that I might, perhaps, love her in
time. After breakfast she even took a small tortoise shell comb
out of her head and parted my hair, which made me feel very
happy, for I loved to be caressed by women much better
than by men. Mr. Bassett then carried me to a school-house
and gave me in charge of a man whom I disliked exceedingly
the moment I saw him. His name was Bidler. He was tall,
thin and sallow; his voice was a kind of squeak, and before he

<!-- Volume I, Page 35 -->

spoke to you he had a strange manner of glaring upon you
through a pair of very large spectacles. I was very much
frightened at first, for I had never been in a school-house of
any kind before, and I had a great dread of learning,
probably because I was very ignorant, and was ashamed to discover it.
When I found myself in the midst of a room full of boys, who
looked at me very curiously from behind their books, I felt
abashed and would have cried if I had not been ashamed to let
them see me. But this feeling did not last long. I soon found
that there were greater dunces than myself in the school, and
got into a fight the very first day, and came off victorious. I
discovered that I was rising in the esteem of my school-fellows;
but my shocking ignorance prevented the master from showing
any marked respect for me. I flattered myself, however, that I
should soon gain his good opinion by attention to my studies, for
I had an ambition to be thought well of by everybody. But an
unfortunate accident made me an enemy in my teacher, whom I
never succeeded in converting into a friend. One day while I
was poring over my book, one of the boys whispered something
in my ear which caused me to break out into a laugh.  The
master asked me what I was laughing at, and I immediately
replied that I was laughing at him, which was true, for the
boy who whispered in my ear had said something funny about
his goggle eyes. All the boys in the school then laughed, and
the master was in a great passion, and asked me how I dared to
tell him such a thing to his face.</p>

<p>"Because it was true," I replied, "and I must never tell
a lie."</p>

<p>"Come here, sir!" said the master, seizing a cowskin which
he kept hanging over his desk, "and I will teach you to speak
the truth, you young villain!"</p>

<p>But I was so much frightened by the angry expression of his
face that I caught my hat and ran out of school. I went home,
and when Mr. Bassett heard my story, he said I had acted
exactly right, and praised me for telling the truth and speaking

<!-- Volume I, Page 36 -->

my mind boldly. This made me feel very proud, and I thought
I would always continue to speak the truth, since it gained me
the good will of such a person as Mr. Bassett, whom I began to
love very much. As we were sitting at tea that day, the school-master
called to make a complaint against me, and related to
Mr. Bassett the circumstances just as I had told them, upon
which he turned to the schoolmaster and said, with more severity
than I had heard him use before:</p>

<p>"What a precious teacher you are for infant minds, to attempt
to punish a child for having the ingenuousness to speak truly,
instead of denying his thoughts, as most children would have
done. Sir, I am ashamed of you; you would make liars of the
little ones entrusted to your charge by flogging them for telling
the truth. It is by such as you that the world is filled with
hypocrites and deceivers. And you are a professor of religion
and a believer in the Bible! You would punish this honest little
fellow for setting your scholars an example of candor and
integrity! I am ashamed of you. But you shall have no boy
of mine to ruin by your bad instructions."</p>

<p>"If you had ever read your Bible," replied the schoolmaster,
"you would know what King Solomon says, namely: 'Spare
the rod, and spoil the boy.'"</p>

<p>"I care nothing for King Solomon," said Mr. Bassett, "but I
can tell you this: I will not send the boy to you again, and if he
cannot be sent to school without being taught to lie, he shall
grow up in ignorance."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster looked very sheepish, but still he did not
confess his error, as he should have done. He said that he
thought it of very little consequence whether I was sent to school
or not, for I was too great a dunce ever to learn anything, and
he could see it in my face that I should come to the gallows;
besides, he had intended to dismiss me, for he kept a select school
for young gentlemen, and he did not wish to take anybody's illegitimate
spawn.</p>

<p>Having said this, he retreated very suddenly, which was fortunate

<!-- Volume I, Page 37 -->

for him, as Mr. Bassett turned red in the face with passion,
and would no doubt have taken hold of him and thrust him out of
the house, if he had not gone of his own will so quickly.</p>

<p>But a new trouble now beset us: Mrs. Bassett burst into tears
and would not be comforted; her husband coaxed her in the tenderest
manner to tell what ailed her, but the only reply she made
was to clasp her hands and declare that now she should die, and
there would be an end to her sufferings. I was surprised to see
him so much troubled&mdash;for, from what I had already observed of
his wife's conduct, I knew that such attacks were not dangerous; and
I was sure that he must have seen her recover from a good
many like it. But he was too good a man to be indifferent even
to his wife's hysterics, and he ran about, in great alarm, with vinegar
cruets and camphor bottles, trying to do something to quiet
her; but she continued to cry and twist her hands in a frightful
manner, and whenever he came near her she would turn from him
and beg him not to touch her or look at her. Thinking that my
presence might put some restraint upon the lady, I withdrew and
went up into my room, where I remained until the next morning,
at breakfast time.</p>

<p>There was no one at the table but Mr. Bassett and myself: he
told me that his wife was too ill to come down, and that I must be
very careful and treat her with the greatest respect, for at present
she had taken a dislike to me; but he had no doubt she would, in
time, learn to love me. To which I replied that I was very sure
I should never learn to love her.</p>

<p>"That's right, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, "that's the way&mdash;always
speak out your thoughts, and you will in time learn to have
no thoughts which you should not speak. But if you can help
it, you must not think in that way about Mrs. Bassett, because it
will prevent her loving you."</p>

<p>"Then she must behave better to you," I replied&mdash;"or I am
sure I shall always think so."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Bassett, heaving a deep sigh, "Poor Jane! it's
all owing to her love for me, Tom; and how can I blame her?

<!-- Volume I, Page 38 -->

She loves me to that degree that it makes her unhappy to think
that I love any thing besides her. I am afraid, Tom, that I shall
be compelled to find another home for you."</p>

<p>As he said those words I began to cry myself, for I had now
begun to love him, and having experienced the delights of a pleasant
home, I was frightened at the prospect of being deprived of it.</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" said Mr. Bassett, "I am grieved for you.
But do not be frightened&mdash;I will not desert you. If I send you
away I will provide another home for you, where you will be happier
than you can be here."</p>

<p>I was too much grieved to speak, and covering my face with
my napkin, I continued to sob and cry, until he drew me kindly
to his chair and wiped my eyes and told me to be quiet and listen
to him while he explained to me the necessity of my being
sent away.</p>

<p>"I was once," said Mr. Bassett&mdash;"a little poor boy like yourself,
only I was more unfortunate than you are, because I had a
cruel father who neglected me, and a feeble mother whose misfortunes
I had to endure besides my own; and there was no kind
friend to take care of me, because people said I had parents
whose duty it was to clothe me and send me to school."</p>

<p>"Did you know who your father was?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom, I did," replied Mr. Bassett, smiling.</p>

<p>"Ah, then, you are not so unfortunate as I am," I replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was;" he said, "to have a father whom you cannot
remember with affection or respect, is the greatest misfortune that
can befall a child, and this misfortune was mine. So do not think
yourself unhappy, my dear boy, because you are ignorant of your
father's name, perhaps you would be still more unhappy if you
knew it.</p>

<p>This did not appear possible to me, I had thought so much about
not having a father, and had heard other boys talk of their parents
with such envious feelings, that I looked upon myself as the most
unhappy boy in the whole world, and believed that everybody
must be happy who could boast of a father. But I did not tell
Mr. Bassett all my thoughts.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 39 -->

<p>"My father not only treated me unkindly," he continued, "but
he ill-used my mother, and by his bad conduct hastened her death
if he did not cause it. The remembrance of this you may be
sure is enough to make me always unhappy; however, I had so
much unhappiness when I was a child, that when I grew up to
be a man, I resolved that I would make amends for my early
sufferings by having a happy home of my own. So I got married
and anticipated a good deal of pleasure in educating my
children, and showing them the love and kindness which I had
felt the want of in a father myself, and as I had seen my mother
suffer from the ill-treatment of my father, I meant to make some
amends for his errors by tender treatment of my own wife. But this
is a strange world, Tom! I have never known the pleasures of a
father, and Mrs. Bassett is so unfortunate in her temper that you
have seen how she defeats all my endeavors to render our
home the paradise which I had hoped to make it. I thought, Tom,
that she might be induced to love you, and that we would adopt
you as our own, and you should be our son. But, ah! I did not
foresee what this scheme would cost me. Instead of loving you,
Tom, she hates you so intensely that I am afraid she will never
be reconciled to your living with us. But it is not for anything
that you have done, my poor boy! it is because she is jealous of
me and thinks that I have bought you home because I am your
father."</p>

<p>A new light broke upon me and I could now account for Mrs.
Bassett's cruelty to me; I began to hate her, too, for her suspicions,
and a thought flashed upon my mind that perhaps he was
my father. My face must have looked very red, and I felt as
though I were on fire, and the blood seemed to boil in my veins.
I pressed closely to him and felt that I must be his child, or else
why should I love him so well and why should he love me? It
was a tormenting, thrilling sensation that I experienced, but I was
afraid to speak my thoughts, as I had done on other occasions, lest
they should displease him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she would have outgrown her foolish suspicion,"

<!-- Volume I, Page 40 -->

continued Mr. Bassett, "but the school-master gave new life to
her jealousy last night, by a word that he dropped, which was
the cause of her crying so bitterly; and her passions have been
so wrought upon that I shall be afraid of her life, if you should
remain here longer."</p>

<p>"This intelligence made me very unhappy, but I could do nothing
to avert my fate; the next day Mr. Bassett told me that he
had found a home for me where I would be very comfortable, and
that he would not desert me, and that I had only to be a good boy
and speak the truth always, and I should find a father and a protector
in him. This word father, again struck upon my heart,
and filled me with tormenting suspicions, and made me feel very
wretched; but I struggled with my feelings and tried to hide
them, and if Mr. Bassett discovered anything unusual in my
looks, he probably attributed the cause to my grief at leaving him.</p>

<p>During all this time I saw nothing of Mrs. Bassett, and I supposed
that she stayed in her room to avoid seeing me, for which I
was very glad, for I now felt jealous of her power over her
husband, and I hated her not only for driving me away from her
house, but because she made him so unhappy. But I discovered
afterwards that I was mistaken in this supposition; that unreasonable
woman had left her excellent husband the same night on
which the difficulty with my school-master occurred, and having
gone home to her mother's house, had refused to return while I
remained under the shelter of her husband's roof. Mr. Bassett
at first refused to turn me out of doors, but afterwards resolved to
board me in a private family, and keep it a secret from his wife.
But he never told me of his wife's conduct on this occasion, probably
out of delicacy to her infirmities of temper, which he tried
hard to hide from the world's observation; in this, however, he
was not very successful, for her character was well known
amongst his acquaintances, who, knowing his own kind disposition,
pitied him, while they censured his yielding to her whims.</p>

<p>My only grief in leaving the house of my protector was the loss
of his society, and the dread which I felt of entering the family

<!-- Volume I, Page 41 -->

of a stranger; but I looked as cheerful as I could, and having
packed up my clothes in a little bundle, ran down into the kitchen
to say good-bye to Bridget, from whom I had to run hard to
escape being half smothered in her greasy arms.</p>

<p>Since leaving Apponagansett, I had encountered but one
enemy, who was the wife of my best friend, and I had gained so
much confidence in my powers of pleasing, that I think my behavior
must have sometimes bordered upon rudeness to my superiors.
Feeling entirely confident of making friends wherever I
went, and never yet having experienced the miseries of want, I
felt no apprehensions for the future, and I would have been as
happy, to use an expression of my grandfather Pepper's, as a clam
at high water, if it had not been for separating from Mr. Bassett,
whom I loved as well almost as I had loved my mother.</p>

<p>On leaving his house for my new home, he waited until it was
quite dark, to avoid, I supposed, the observations of his wife.
He took me by the hand as we walked through the streets, and
employed the whole time in repeating to me the importance of
perfect candor and truthfulness in all the conduct of life, and
exacted a promise from me that I would continue to act with as
much sincerity and ingenuousness as I had done since he took me
under his protection. When we arrived at my new home, he
entered the house with me, and having introduced me to the
family, he gave me a silk purse containing four half dollars, which
seemed to me an immense fortune, for I had never been the owner
of a sixpence at a time in my whole life; he then pressed my
hand tenderly, and bade me good night, and I was so much affected
at parting with him that I sat down and wept until the little daughter
of my new keeper called me to supper.</p>

<p>My new home impressed me more disagreeably at first than the
house of Mr. Bassett had done, for it was much smaller, in a worse
neighborhood, and more meanly furnished. It was a little brick
house, with a wooden stoop, jammed in between two tall buildings
in Hague street, and surrounded on all sides by leather dressers'
shops, which sent forth effluvia in hot weather very far indeed

<!-- Volume I, Page 42 -->

from being pleasant, although I was told it was very wholesome;
the street, too, was extremely narrow, and so much below the
level of the neighboring streets that it was called the Swamp;
there were no trees, no grape-vines, no green patches of ground
to be seen anywhere, and the inhabitants of this dismal place
were completely excluded from the face of nature, excepting the
little blue strip of sky, to be seen by casting the eye up above
the tops of the houses. Why men should consent voluntarily to
bury themselves from all the charms of nature, in such melancholy
holes, was a mystery to me then, and is a wonder to me
now. The room in which I slept was a little chamber under the
eaves of the house, with a low dormer window, into which the sun
never once did me the favor to peep while I occupied it. Although
it was small and dark, it was perfectly clean; and I was most
happy to find a picture hanging at the foot of my bed, representing
a subject which was very agreeable to me&mdash;a ship under full
sail, with an immense flag of the stars and stripes flying at her
mast head.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p>THE exact motives of Mr. Bassett in placing me in this family
I never knew, but I suppose that he wanted to put me in as
obscure a place as possible, in the hope of his wife not being able
to find me out. The family consisted of a man and his wife, and
a daughter very nearly my own age; she might have been a year
or two younger. The family name was Swayne, which the wife
who had a peculiar pronunciation, used to pronounce with great
pomposity, when addressing her husband, Swine. He kept a
small ship-grocery in Water street, and happily for us all only
remained in the house long enough to eat his meals. The daughter's
name was Sylvia, and as fresh and beautiful as anything
lovely that can be conceived.  If I had been of the proper age to

<!-- Volume I, Page 43 -->

fall in love I should have lost my heart in five minutes after seeing
her, but as it was, I looked at her and admired her as innocently
as though she had been a beautiful picture or a wax-doll.
Her father was something more than the opposite of Mr. Bassett,
he was altogether a different sort of man.</p>

<p>He was short in stature, but his arms were long, his eyes were
crooked, his face was very brown and pock-marked, his manners
were rough, and his conversation was coarse; and to complete
his disagreeablenesses, he always had his mouth full of tobacco.
The first time that I saw him was at supper, when he entered the
room, and without speaking a word, sat down at the table.</p>

<p>"Swine, my dear," said his wife&mdash;"this is Master Thomas Pepper,
our new boarder."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" growled the master of the frightened
household.</p>

<p>"Nothink in particular, my love," replied his wife, soothingly,
"only he is a pretty fellow&mdash;don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Mr. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Well, I rather thought so," said the terrified woman, looking
up in his face with a faint smile; "but it's no matter: 'andsome
is as 'andsome does, any 'ow. He'll make a nice beau for our
Sylvia, won't he?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, and don't be a fool," said Swayne; "but let me
catch him cutting up any monkey shines in this house, and I'll
beau him!"</p>

<p>"Why, Swine, my love!" said his wife, with an affected air
of astonishment&mdash;as though she was not perfectly familiar with
this style of conversation&mdash;"what does ail you to-night? 'as anythink
'appened at the store?"</p>

<p>"Give me my tea, will you!" growled her husband, in reply.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Master Thomas," said Mrs. Swayne,
"my husband don't mean anythink&mdash;it's only one of his little
ways."</p>

<p>"I am not frightened," I replied; "I don't care anything about
him;" and, in truth, I did not&mdash;for I was rather amused at the

<!-- Volume I, Page 44 -->

strange beast.  Little Sylvia laughed merrily at my reply, and her
father only looked at me and shook his head, as much as to say
"Look out for yourself," which I meant to do; and if Mr.
Swayne should dare to offend me, I intended to inform Mr. Bassett,
whose power I thought vast enough to crush an entire community
of such ruffians. The truth was that Mr. Swayne was
not so rare a specimen of my species to me as Mr. Bassett&mdash;for I
had seen many similar to him in Apponagansett, and knew that
they were not dangerous, although they were disagreeable. But
this respectable head of a family was rather an exaggeration of
his class&mdash;being unlike the greater part of those I had seen, worse
than he appeared.  Not relishing the merriment of his little
daughter&mdash;whose innocent laughter must have grated harshly in
his ears&mdash;he struck her a hard blow, and then sent her away from
the table for crying.</p>

<p>His wife held the carving knife in her hand, and probably felt
inclined to thrust its point into his heart; but she affected not to
hear the cries of her little daughter, and looking mildly at her
husband, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Swine, my dear, will I give you a nice little bit of the 'am?"</p>

<p>"If I want any ham I can help myself," replied Mr. Swayne.
He then finished his supper in silence, and rose from the table
hastily, put on his hat, and hurried out, slamming the door after
him. He had no sooner gone than Mrs. Swayne caught the weeping
Sylvia in her arms and kissed away her tears.</p>

<p>"Come, now, he is gone, and we will have a nice quiet bit of
supper," said the poor woman; "here's a nice bit of cake I saved
on purpose for your suppers: O, it's very good. You mustn't think.
anythink at all about Sylvia's father, Master Thomas&mdash;he is a
good soul and an excellent provider, and he loves Sylvia and me
like everythink; but he is so worried in his business that sometimes
he is quite out of humor. I think Swine will one of these
days go on to a farm, and then we shall have everythink very
comfortable, and he will never be out of humor at all. I am
sure I should be just as bad if I were in his place&mdash;for it's dreadfully

<!-- Volume I, Page 45 -->

bad collecting bills, and the shipping merchants won't pay
until the ships come back, sometimes. I suppose, Master Thomas,
you are not used to such things; but there is always somethink
in every family: if it isn't one think it is another. Swine is a
good 'usband to me, let him be what he will to others; and I am
sure he never gave me a cross word in his life, only when he is just
a little out of humor with his business, which doesn't amount to
anythink at all, you know&mdash;for what's the matter of a few words
from a man that's a good provider, Master Thomas?  We always
have the best of everythink in the 'ouse, and I am sure if Sylvia
and me could eat gold he'd bring it home to us: I am certain of
it. But Swine has one little fault which I'm sure he can't help,
because it's his nature, and so I can't blame him for it: he is
dreadful jealous, and I can't look at anybody without his getting
in a passion about it; and I shouldn't wonder, Master Thomas, if
he was out of humor because I called you a pretty fellow."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "does he think himself handsome?"</p>

<p>"Well, I rather think he does," said Mrs. Swayne; "and I am
sure Swine is not the ugliest man in the world."</p>

<p>"I think he is," I said.</p>

<p>"Nay, Master Thomas," said the good wife&mdash;"Not quite so
bad as that, I hope; but however, 'andsome is as 'andsome does,'
and I am sure Swine is not the worst man in the world."</p>

<p>Here again I differed with the lady, and of course said so.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare; but that beats everythink, Master Thomas.
Upon my word, you speak your mind very plainly!" said Mrs.
Swayne.</p>

<p>"To be sure I do," I replied; "I mustn't disguise my thoughts,
because that would be telling a lie."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! If ever I heard anythink to beat that!" exclaimed
the astonished lady, throwing down the napkin with
which she was wiping the cups, and holding up both hands to express
her amazement. "Sylvia, did you ever hear anythink like
that before? Well, Master Thomas, such principles as them
won't do for this world, I am sure. If you tell my 'usband what
you think of him he will act dreadful."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 46 -->

<p>In similar talk we passed the time while my mistress was clearing
away the tea table, for she kept no servant, and little Sylvia
sat looking on in eloquent silence, with her large black eyes fixed
wonderingly on my face. I was completely fascinated by the
little creature, and already felt glad of my change of home, since
it had brought me into the presence of such a beautiful object;
and good Mrs. Swayne appeared to me still better for being the
mother of so sweet a daughter. By and by it was time for bed;
but the master of the house had not come home, and Mrs. Swayne
said&mdash;"Come, children, let us go up to our beds and say our little
prayers, that we may all get up bright and early in the
morning. Bid Master Thomas good night, Sylvia."</p>

<p>But Sylvia hung down her head, and cast a glance at me from
the corners of her eyes, without uttering a word.</p>

<p>"Nay, my daughter," said her mother, "but that is very unginteel.
You must say good night to Master Thomas."</p>

<p>But Sylvia would not say good night, and my pride was hurt
at her refusal.</p>

<p>"Then if you will not say good night, Master Thomas shall
give you a kiss: he shall, indeed;" and as she still persisted in
her silence, I took the hint of her mother, and attempted to put
my arms around her neck. But the little creature ran screaming
from me, and I pursued her until at last I succeeded in penning
her behind a door; and in spite of her screams and struggles,
held her fast in my arms while I kissed her luscious cheeks.</p>

<p>Sylvia's mother laughed merrily as she witnessed the struggle,
and applauded my gallantry; but the little girl blushed as red as
scarlet, and hid her face in her hands. The tussle and excitement
had raised my blood to a boiling heat, and the touch of her
burning cheeks sent a thrill of wild delight through my veins
which I can never forget. It was one of the eras of my life. I
had made a discovery which should have been delayed for years:
it was one of those accidents which can never be foreseen, and the
consequences of which cannot be controlled. I had, unknowingly,
unlocked one of the great mysteries of life, and was thereafter
to be a wiser though not a better boy.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 47 -->

<p>Mrs. Swayne followed me up stairs into my little dormitory,
and the kind hearted soul would persist in putting me to bed in
spite of my remonstrances. It was so long since I had been used
to such attentions that they amazed me; but I could not escape
from her tender officiousness, and after she had covered me with the
sheets she stooped down and gave me a kiss. How differently it
affected me from the burning kiss of the bewitching Sylvia!</p>

<p>"Good night, Master Thomas" said the kind soul as she took
the candle to go down stairs; "good night, and if you wants anythink
just rap on the floor, and me or Swine will come up to you."</p>

<p>"Good night!" I cried, and the next moment I was asleep and
dreaming of little Sylvia.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p>TWO or three days passed without Mr. Bassett coming to see me,
and I had grown so intimate with little Sylvia, and so fond of her
mother, that I had almost forgotten him; but I was very glad to
see him again, notwithstanding, when he did come&mdash;the third day
after I had parted with him; and I told him everything that had
happened since I had been living, as he called it, at the Hague&mdash;excepting
only the tussle which I had with Sylvia behind the door.
Mrs. Swayne praised me very highly to Mr. Bassett and said
"she and Swine were perfectly delighted with me."</p>

<p>The delight of "Swine" I thought a rather doubtful matter&mdash;for
he had hardly spoken to me, and seemed quite the reverse of
pleased when he looked at me; and I declared my doubts without
any hesitation.</p>

<p>"Nay Master Thomas," said Mrs. Swayne&mdash;"my 'usband
likes you like everythink. But Swine is such a strange creature,
sir; and he is so much engaged with his business at the store,
that he has no time to make himself agreeable in the 'ouse at all.
I dare say it is the same with you, sir."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 48 -->

<p>Mr. Bassett smiled at the good woman and told her she must
not call me Master Thomas any more, because my name was Tom.
He then took me aside and told me that the reason of his neglecting
me so long was because his wife had set a watch upon him,
that she might find out where he had taken me; and that he had
great difficulty to come and see me then, without her knowledge.
This information excited my animosity to Mrs. Bassett very much,
and I spoke my thoughts freely, and said&mdash;"How I do hate that
homely woman."</p>

<p>"That's right, Tom&mdash;speak out your feelings; but you must
endeavor, my poor boy, to feel differently," said Mr. Bassett, patting
me on the head.</p>

<p>"O, I am astonished with you, Master Thomas!" said Mrs.
Swayne, quite horror-struck at my boldness&mdash;"I am sure you
don't think so."</p>

<p>"Yes I do," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard nothink to beat that!" said the good soul,
lifting up her hands; "if you should talk so about me I am sure
Swine would flog you like anythink."</p>

<p>"My dear Madam," said Mr. Bassett&mdash;"I am afraid you will
instill very bad principles into Tom's mind. Pray do you punish
your own child for speaking the truth?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope not," said  Mrs. Swayne, blushing; "but I am
sure everybody ought to be punished for saying anythink about
anybody's wife to his face."</p>

<p>"My dear Madam, do you pretend to say that we should not
utter our thoughts candidly?" said Mr. Bassett&mdash;"do you not believe
it is better to speak freely what we think than to think badly
without speaking?"</p>

<p>"Well, I dare say it is all right; but not when anythink is said
about anybody's wife," replied Mrs. Swayne, with a considerable
show of temper.</p>

<p>"My dear Madam," said Mr. Bassett&mdash;"I differ from you on
that point. As sin was first introduced into the world by lying,
so is it kept in the world by the same means."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 49 -->

<p>"But that has nothink to do with saying things about anybody's
wife," added Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"In discussing a broad principle, Madam," said Mr. Bassett,
drawing his chair towards her&mdash;"we must not allow our reason
to be influenced by personal feelings, nor deny a truth because it
happens to be unpalatable."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure, I knew all that before; but that hasn't anythink
to do with calling anybody's wife homely. I am quite sure it
hasn't."</p>

<p>"I perceive, Madam, that you don't understand me," said Mr.
Bassett; "let me explain myself: since it is only by entire truthfulness
that we can be happy in this world, or hope for happiness
in the next, who will dare to peril his own salvation and that of
others, by acting a falsehood?  And I maintain, Madam, that to
disguise the truth is to pronounce a lie."

<p>"Yes, but what's the need of saying anythink about a man's
wife when she isn't by? I am sure there's nothink good in that,
and Swine would go on like anythink about it if he was to
hear somethink said about me, and that's the truth," said Mrs.
Swayne.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," said Mr. Bassett, mildly; "but still, Madam,
that does not in the least invalidate my position. All the
evil in the world springs from falsehood; therefore are we bound
to speak and act truthfully in the smallest as well as in the most
important affairs of life, that evil may be removed from the world.
I have suffered too much, Madam, from false appearances, and
from false representations, not to hate falsehoods and love truth."</p>

<p>"Yes, but when anythink is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hear me out, Madam, I beseech you," said Mr. Bassett, interrupting
her&mdash;"hear me out, and then I will listen to your argument.
Now, I am willing to acknowledge that I have not always
acted with that strict regard for truth which I am determined
hereafter to exact from others. I was educated to lie and deceive.
I shudder to think of the lies I have uttered. I have often told
my friends I was glad to see them when I wished them in Flanders:

<!-- Volume I, Page 50 -->

I have expressed regrets at the death of people in whose
fate I felt no interest whatever: I have smiled upon men when I
have felt angry enough to strike them. In short, Madam, I have
been a thorough social hypocrite; and such is the force of habit
and the influence of example, that I fear I shall always continue
so. But this darling boy shall be imbued with a love of truth:
he shall be educated to regard everything as of minor importance
when compared with candor and sincerity; for I believe if there
were but one really truthful person in the world, the influence of
his example would spread until all mankind would be released
from the thralldom of sin. It was once asked&mdash;'What is truth?'
but truth need not be sought: it dwells within us; and we have
only to remain quiet, and she will reveal herself to the world
through us. It is my aim to be instrumental in educating one
soul to a life of truth and purity; and in this ingenuous child I
have found a subject that has thus far equalled my highest wishes."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am sure it isn't polite to say anythink uncivil about
a man's wife to his own face. That I will stick to," said Mrs.
Swayne.</p>

<p>"My good woman," said Mr. Bassett, with greater seriousness&mdash;"you
seem determined not to comprehend me. Which is better:
to offend the pride of a silly woman&mdash;or to pollute a young
and innocent soul with a corrupt thought?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure, I can't say as to that; but if Swine should
hear Master Thomas say anythink about me, I don't know what
he wouldn't do," she replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett sighed, and said&mdash;"My dear friend, you will oblige
me very much by not calling Tom 'Master Thomas:' it is these
little departures from truth in trifles which lead to deceptions in
more serious matters. Ah! madam, I have endured too much
from the dissimulations of others, to tolerate deceit."</p>

<p>Just at this moment little Sylvia ran into the room and said
that a lady at the door wanted to see her mother. Mrs. Swayne
stepped out of the room, and returned directly with her hands
held up in a manner to express the greatest consternation.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 51 -->

<p>"O! 'evans!" she said, in a loud whisper&mdash;"it's your lady,
sir, Mrs. Bassett!"</p>

<p>"My wife?" exclaimed Mr. Bassett, in alarm&mdash;"what shall I
do? Did you let her know I was here?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Can't I jump out of a window? What shall I do?" said Mr.
Bassett, scrutinizing the apartment; but there were no means of
escape: the only windows in the room opened upon the street, and
the only stairs led to the door where his wife stood.</p>

<p>"She must not see Tom," he said&mdash;"or I shall never know another
quiet hour.  My dear Madam, you must hide us.  There
is no help for it. She will be gone, soon, and then we can come
out, and nobody will be the wiser. Tom, you must creep under
the bed, and take that little girl with you; and don't breathe
loud for your lives. Now, my good woman, just allow me to
step into that wardrobe, and then turn the key upon me. It will
all be over soon; and you will not be the poorer for it, I assure
you. Don't keep me here any longer than you can help, for it is
very close. There."</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett said no more, for a footstep was heard upon the
stairs, and Mrs. Swayne closed the door of the clothes press
quickly, and turned the key. The next moment Mrs. Bassett
came in.</p>

<p>"This is very strange, Madam," said that lady; "Very
strange. Are you quite sure that my husband has not been
here?"</p>

<p>"He was here a week or two ago, I think, to see my 'usband
on some business about somethink," replied Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"And you don't know what his business was ?"</p>

<p>"Well; my 'usband never tells his business to nobody; and I
am sure I am not the one to ask him."</p>

<p>"He doesn't!" screamed Mrs. Bassett&mdash;"It's well he's not a
husband of mine. And you take no boarders in your house?"</p>

<p>"O, no&mdash;my old man is too good a provider for me and my little
girl, to allow of that."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 52 -->

<p>"And is there no house in this neighborhood where they would
be likely to take a suspicious little boy to board?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am sure there isn't," said Mrs. Swayne; "I am
quite positive of it. There's  Mr. O'Neil&mdash;the grocer, on the
corner&mdash;that's quite above such business; and there's Mr.
Scrymger, that keeps the finding store, he's got too many boys of
his own."</p>

<p>"It is very strange, indeed&mdash;very strange," said Mrs. Bassett,
doubtingly. "This house answers the description exactly. But
I am sorry to have given you this trouble. Perhaps, Madam, you
have not got a deceitful husband, who is all the time doing things
against your will; and so you cannot know how to pity me."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure Swine is one of the best of 'usbands, and a
most hexcellent provider; and such an affectionate creature I
am sure, is no telling," said Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"What a happy woman you are!&mdash;how much to be envied!
And with such a sweet little daughter! Where is that beautiful
child? Hark! what was that? I heard something!"</p>

<p>"It's the cat, I am sure," said Mrs. Swayne. "But, good 'evans!
there's my 'usband's tread! I can hear him coming down
the street."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence for a few minutes, and then the heavy
tread of Mr. Swayne's feet was heard in the entry below.
Presently he called out from the foot of the stairs&mdash;"Mary Ann,
who's hat is this?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure I don't know, Swine," she answered: "it
must be Master Thomas'."</p>

<p>"Master devil's!" he roared out; "it's a man's hat."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure I can't help it, Swine," said his wife, in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>"You can't help it!" he cried out, in a furious rage; "I must
know about this," and immediately be came stamping up stairs.

<p>Sylvia and I had lain very still under the bed, with our arms
round each other's necks; but from some cause or other, just as
her father came up stairs, she screamed, and we were discovered.

<!-- Volume I, Page 53 -->

As we crept from under the bed, she began to sob; but I was too
much frightened to speak.</p>

<p>The moment that Mrs. Bassett discovered me, she pounced
upon me as a cat pounces upon a trembling mouse. "O, you
little wretch!" she exclaimed, as she caught me by the arm,
"O, you villain! I will teach you manners. Where is my
husband? Speak, before I shake the life out of you! Don't
deceive me, or I will have you sent to the alms-house, you
monstrous villain. Where is he? But you won't speak; he
has taught you to be as deceitful as himself."</p>

<p>Although I knew the consequences of revealing the hiding
place of my dearest friend, I had no alternative but to obey his
instructions and speak the truth. "He is in the clothes-press,"
I said.</p>

<p>"O, Master Thomas! how can you fib so?" said Mrs.
Swayne, turning pale, "I never heard anythink like it, I am
sure!"</p>

<p>This disclosure produced a wild scream from Mrs. Bassett and
an oath from Mr. Swayne, both of whom immediately sprang
towards the door of the clothes-press.</p>

<p>"Where's the key?" demanded Swayne.</p>

<p>"O, Swine!" said his affrighted wife, falling upon her knees,
"O, my dear, don't say anythink about it. It was only a joke,
wasn't it, Sylvia? warn't it, Master Thomas? Don't be angry,
Swine; I couldn't help it."

"The key! the key!" shouted Swayne and Mrs. Bassett, in
concert; "the key!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Swayne produced the key from her side pocket, and the
next moment my dear benefactor was released from his hiding
place; as he stepped into the middle of the floor, he seemed,
as might be expected, a good deal confused, and quite at a loss what
to do with himself, but his wife immediately began in her old
strain, to reproach him with unfaithfulness and want of love. As
for "Swine," he was quite speechless with rage; he turned as
pale as a person of his brown complexion could and filled his

<!-- Volume I, Page 54 -->

mouth with tobacco; only intimating, by shaking his clenched
fist at his wife, his feelings towards her. Mrs. Bassett, having
poured out her usual torrent of words, fell into a chair and began
to shed her usual quantity of tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett having had time to recover himself from his confusion,
said, "I am sorry to have caused any trouble in your
family, my friend, and I beg you will not think ill of your wife
because I was found here in such a suspicious situation; the
fault is all my own."</p>

<p>"It was, indeed, Swine," said  Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said "Swine."</p>

<p>"I will, Swine, only don't swear at me," said his wife.</p>

<p>"As for you, my dear," said  Mr. Bassett to his wife, "I am
ashamed of you. How can you expose yourself, and render me
ridiculous by such conduct? Come, let us go home."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! hear him!" cried Mrs. Bassett, suddenly
drying her tears, and rising from her seat; "I render you
ridiculous! Did I bring you into a woman's bed-room and lock
you up in a clothes-press? Did I encourage you to bring home
that nasty brat?"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, my love," said Mr. Bassett.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't call me your love; anything but that. You
never loved me. I know it and feel it, and mother and sister
always said so. I am a poor, broken-hearted creature, and I
will go home and die. But don't follow me. Stay here with
your son. I can't expect you to love me, and I don't. You love
him best, I know, and it's natural. I have no children, and I
have no right to expect your affections. There was a time once&mdash;but
that time is past. Don't follow me. Don't be a hypocrite.
I know you don't love me, and it's no use for you to say so. I
shan't believe it. There's the object of your affections. Stay
and be happy, only don't weep for me; don't put on mourning
when I am dead and gone. If you should, I wouldn't rest in my
grave. Ah! sir" (<i>turning to "Swine,"</i>) "you little know the
deceit and wickedness there is in this world."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 55 -->

<p>"Jane, my dear, I beg you to be quiet" said Mr. Bassett,
soothingly, "don't expose yourself."</p>

<p>But the expostulations of her husband only fanned the flames
of her resolution to go home and die, and when she had repeated
her firm conviction two or three times more, that he didn't love
her and never had, and that he had formed a determination to kill
her, by his cruelty, she marched off and left us all standing in
fear and trembling of each other.</p>

<p>"This is a most unpleasant affair," said Mr. Bassett, "a very
foolish piece of business; and all brought about by my own
folly. I beg your pardon, madam, and yours, too, sir, for the
trouble I have caused. Ah, Tom, my little fellow, you little
know the harm you have done by telling Mrs. Bassett that I was
in the clothes-press. But you did right. The fault was all
mine in attempting to secrete myself. I love you for your truthfulness,
and will not desert you. In fact, I am glad that your
place of concealment has been discovered, for I hate dissimulation.
Good bye, sir; good bye, madam; good bye, Tom, until
I see you again. I must go and find my wife." Mr. Bassett
took his hat out of "Swine's" hand, and hurried down stairs, and
little Sylvia and I immediately followed him, for we were in a
hurry to get out of the reach of her father's hard hand, which
seemed to be preparing itself to execute some commission from
its master. What occurred between "Swine" and his terrified
wife, after we left, I never knew; but when we came in to our
supper, a few hours afterwards, he sat looking very sulky, and
she was wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron. I suspected
that he had struck her, for I never saw her look so heart-broken
before and I wished myself big enough to flog him, not
only for his cruelty to her, but because he had struck little
Sylvia; and I promised myself that I would give him a good
thrashing as soon as I got to be a man.</p>

<p>"Come, Master Thomas, come, Sylvia," said Mrs. Swayne,
trying to smile and look cheerful, "come to your suppers. I
have got a nice bit of cold meat for you."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 56 -->

<p>"There, quit that!" said "Swine," as I attempted to whisper
something in Sylvia's ear; "I will teach you to behave yourself,
you rascal."</p>

<p>"Swine, my dear, Thomas didn't mean anythink, I am sure,"
said Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," I replied; "I meant to say I hated him because
he is so ugly."</p>

<p>This piece of candor very nearly cost me my life, for "Swine"
immediately jumped at me, livid with rage, and seizing me by
the throat, would undoubtedly have put an end to my adventures,
had it not been for the screams of Sylvia and the cries of her
mother. By the force of their united efforts at screaming, I got
clear from his iron hands, a good deal frightened, and something
hurt.  Mrs. Swayne threw me my hat, and told me to run,
which I did as soon as I reached the street, and never looked
behind me until I was quite clear of "the Hague."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE streets were quite dark, but crowded with passengers,
and as I had never been out alone, in the evening, I began to be
frightened, and was at a loss which way to turn. But I hurried
on, for fear of being overtaken by the savage "Swine," and soon
found myself in Broadway, where the brilliancy of the scene
quite took me by surprise. I spent an hour in looking at the
shop windows, and then feeling very hungry, I bought some
cakes and beer of an old woman who kept a stand at the corner
of the street. My first impulse was to go in search of my benefactor,
but knowing the peculiarity of his domestic relations, I
thought it would be advisable to wait until morning and then call
upon him at his store. I still had the four half dollars in my
pocket, which he had given me, and knew that I could purchase
a lodging for the night, as well as a breakfast in the morning.

<!-- Volume I, Page 57 -->

As I strolled down Broadway, I came to the "Franklin House,"
where, I remembered having heard Mr. Bassett say, some of his
customers boarded. So I went in, and asked the man at the bar
to give me a bed.</p>

<p>"Give you a bed?" said the bar-keeper; "yes, my man, I
will give you a bed if you will give me six shillings."</p>

<p>This I was very willing, as well as able, to do; and I paid
the money with the greater pleasure for being called a man. A
servant was called, and ordered to "show this gentleman to 49."</p>

<p>This made me feel very grand, and I followed the servant up
long flights of stairs carpeted with sheet iron, and through entries
and passages innumerable; sometimes going down and sometimes
going up, until at last we came to a very narrow passage,
with a faint light glimmering at the further end, in a cracked
lantern, giving it the appearance of extreme distance. There
were doors regularly numbered, on each side of the passage, and
49 was about mid-way. The waiter unlocked the door, and I
entered the room in which I was to sleep, when he bade me good
night, and left me. There being nothing in the room to divert
my thoughts and keep me awake, its furniture consisting of one
chair, a wash-hand stand and a small looking glass, I was soon
in bed and asleep. How long I slept I do not know, but I was
awakened by a strange noise in the adjoining room. I had left
my lamp burning upon the table, very fortunately, for the noise
frightened me, and I got up to listen. The noise sounded like
the groans of a man in great pain, and thinking it might be a
sick person in want of assistance, I jumped out of bed, and taking
the lamp in my hand, went into the next room, from whence the
noise seemed to come, where I found a stout, red-faced gentleman,
lying upon his back, and groaning in a most terrific manner, but
apparently sound asleep. I was going to return to my bed
again, without speaking to him, but I remembered that my
grandfather Pepper used to have the night-mare and I thought
that the gentleman might be suffering from the same cause, so I
stepped up to the bed side and put my hand upon his shoulder,

<!-- Volume I, Page 58 -->

and he immediately awoke and started up. "Thank God!
thank God!" he exclaimed, and then opening his eyes and
staring in my face, he said: "But who is this? Good God!
How came you here?"</p>

<p>His violent manner, and strange exclamations, startled me,
and the lamp dropped from my hand and left us in darkness. I
groped my way back to my own room and crept into bed again,
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>I was awake by daylight, and immediately rose and dressed
myself, and with a good deal of difficulty, groped my way
through all the narrow passages and ups and downs which I had
travelled over the night before, until I reached the bar-room,
when I wished the servant who was scrubbing the floor, a good
morning, and walked into the street. The open air was always
delightful to me in all weathers. I had as great a dread of being
shut up as a bird; but I could never feel myself entirely free in
the streets of the city. It seemed, at best, but a large prison to
me, and now in the grey of the morning, when the shops were
all closed, and the only travelers in the streets were laborers
going to their daily work, and here and there a melancholy
female, stepping timidly along with a basket in her hand, and
her head bent down as though she felt herself an intruder, it was
really dull and saddening. So I hurried off to the Bear Market,
for the sake of the life and bustle, the squealing of pigs, the
cackling of hens, the fresh vegetables, redolent of country air
and dews, the butchers, with their rosy faces and snowy white
frocks, the boarding-house keepers cheapening their day's provision,
the robust fishermen, the hearty-laughing market-girls, and,
not the least attractive of all the pleasant things in this noisy
locality, were the hot coffee stands, at one of which I breakfasted
on hot dough nuts, in a most sumptuous and grand style, at the
cost of nearly a shilling.</p>

<p>My sole object now was to find my protector again; but as I
was forbidden his house, I was forced to wait until he came
down to his store. It happened to be later than usual when he

<!-- Volume I, Page 59 -->

came to his place of business this morning, and I thought he
looked weary and melancholy. Probably he had been kept
awake all night by his wife, who rarely allowed him the luxury
of a full night's rest. This loving woman did not choose the
time spent in bed with her husband, to impress upon his mind
her regard for him, and her opinion of his disregard for her,
because it was a time favorable to privacy, for she used to
utter her complaints in so loud a voice, that I was many a time
an unwilling listener to her griefs. I will take this opportunity to
aver, in the most pointed manner, that I never knew her husband
to return her an impatient answer on these occasions, or to say
anything calculated in the slightest degree to excite her ill feelings.</p>

<p>Although I can bear testimony to the perfectly amiable conduct
of Mr. Bassett towards his wife, I am well aware that an opposite
opinion has been entertained by many of his friends, who, knowing
that she was an exceedingly unhappy woman, charitably
attributed her unhappiness to his misconduct; and he, with a
generosity which distinguished all his actions, always assumed
the blame whenever any of their bickerings became known to his
friends. But even those really kind people, who had no disposition
to be censorious, used to say, when speaking of the domestic
infelicities of my benefactor, "Well, there must be fault on both
sides."  And so, poor man, he suffered a daily martyrdom to his
honorable feelings, without ever gaining any credit as a martyr.
But, this must always be the lot of a truly good man, who, like
the sun, still continues to shine, though the light of his good
deeds may be reflected below the horizon of our observation.
My experience has compelled me to believe, that the acts of
domestic heroism performed around us every day in the seclusion
of private life, are more truly worthy of being perpetuated in history,
and by monumental inscriptions, than the dazzling deeds of
public performers, who act their part on the great stage of life
with a consciousness that a world is taking note of their doings.
Indeed, I believe that in almost every family there may be found
a hero or a heroine; a wife who is sacrificing her happiness and

<!-- Volume I, Page 60 -->

health to preserve the character of a brutal husband; a sister
who is wasting her precious hours in wearisome labor, to keep a
heartless brother from disgrace, nursing in her breast the cruel
secret that is preying upon her health, and at last dying a martyr
to her noble soul, unpitied and unwept; or a husband who suffers
the reproaches of the world rather than divulge the infirmities of
a wife, whose ill conduct poisons every hour of his life. When I
remember what those men were, in memory of whom monuments
have been erected and histories written, how acts of violence and
selfishness have gained immortality and present rewards, and
then remember the heroes of private life whom I have known,
who have died and been forgotten, I grow cynical at the thoughts
of fame, and wish that my own name may rest in oblivion with
those of the unknown great. Among all the friends of my dear
benefactor, probably not more than one or two knew the true
nobleness of his character, and none, I am persuaded, could
know it so well as myself, because they could not have enjoyed
the same opportunities of observing him in the closeness of his
domestic relations.</p>

<p>I observed that Mr. Bassett looked weary and dispirited when
he came down to his store, but when he found me there his countenance
brightened, and he expressed a pleasure at seeing me
which made me feel very happy. l related to him faithfully
everything that had happened after parting with him in the
Hague, and as usual he applauded me for what I had done, and
particularly praised me for telling "Swine" my honest opinion of
him. He said he was very glad that I had left them, for he feared
that Mrs. Swayne would have corrupted my morals and taught
me to dissimulate. Finding that I had nearly spent the money
which he had given me, he reached me a silver dollar, and told
me to go and amuse myself as I pleased until a certain time in
the afternoon, and then return to him again. This was very
agreeable to me, for I had naturally a vagabond disposition, and
my affection for the water was quite unconquerable. I liked
work well enough, if it but kept me out of doors and did not confine

<!-- Volume I, Page 61 -->

me too long in one place; but I was better pleased when
I was wholly at liberty and could wander where I liked. On
this occasion I quickly found my way to the Battery, which
pleased me better than any other part of the city, because it bore
some resemblance to my favorite haunts in my native village. I
had not been there long when two young men came and sat down
upon the bench along side of me. One of them said: "Tell me
the time, mister, by your watch;" to which I replied that I
could not tell him the time, as I had no watch. The other said
that I wouldn't dare let him feel in my pocket, and satisfy him
that I told the truth. It vexed me to have my word doubted, so
I told him to search my pockets and be convinced, which he did,
and then begged my pardon for doubting my word. He immediately
jumped up and said to his companion, "Come, Bill,
there's Tom waiting for us with his sculls; if you sit there by
that young chap, perhaps he will pick your pocket!" and then
they ran off. They had scarcely disappeared when I put my
hand in my pocket and found that my money was gone. I only
mention this circumstance because it was my first experience of
the villainy of the world, and because it made a deeper impression
on my mind than many losses which afterwards I sustained,
a hundred times the amount of which I was then robbed,
and I have ever since felt a horror for the detestable meanness of
a thief, let him assume what shape he might, that I cannot but
think has had a salutary effect upon my character. Having lost
all my money I could buy no dinner, so that when I returned to
Mr. Bassett, at the appointed hour, I was almost famished. He
laughed at the loss of my money, and told me it would learn me
a good lesson, not to allow a stranger to put his hand in my
pocket, and so it did. I have many a time since had occasion to
remember this incident, and when a stranger has approached
me with a smooth face and a plausible tongue, I have said to
him, no, no, my friend, I shall not allow you to put your hand in
my pocket; and I have many times saved my money and my
time in consequence. So let me advise you, reader, whenever

<!-- Volume I, Page 62 -->

anybody attempts to make too free with you upon a short
acquaintance, to just remember my loss, and not let him put his
hand in your pocket, unless it should happen to be empty.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett gave me another dollar, and then introduced me
to his book-keeper, with whom he had made an agreement for my
board. My place of residence was to be kept a profound secret
from everybody, excepting Mr. Bassett himself and the book-keeper's
family, for fear of Mrs. Bassett's finding me out, and
causing more difficulty. This arrangement pleased Mr. Bassett
exceedingly, for he could hear from me every day without resorting
to any means which might excite suspicion in the mind of
his wife.  I must confess that all this secrecy and man&oelig;uvring
on the part of Mr. Bassett appeared to me very inconsistent with
his love of truth and transparent actions, but as he did not seem
conscious himself of violating the principles which he was
striving to instill into my mind, I thought it advisable not to
remind him of it. It is probable that he had adopted his theory
of truthfulness so late in life as to be unable to carry it out
wholly in action.</p>

<p>The book-keeper's name was Dribble; he had once been a
jobber himself, but had "bursted up," to use his own phrase, and
ever since, for a good many years, had been employed as book-keeper
by the firm of which Mr. Bassett was the head. Mr.
Dribble was rather elderly; he might have been forty-five or
fifty-five, and rather stout; his head was perfectly round and
smooth, bald on the top, and not a hair on his face. He was one
of those men who consider a beard as an infallible sign of a
highway robber or a Spaniard, and who think that every man
who wears a moustache must be a German. Shaving was a
religious duty with him, and his razors and his prayer-book were
always kept in the same drawer. He had entire faith in the
good old times, and despised all fashions that were not old; he
went to church three times every Sunday, and believed everything
that was uttered in a pulpit or that was called a sermon,
let it be what it might. Mr. Dribble was too soft in his nature

<!-- Volume I, Page 63 -->

to entertain a hard thought about anybody, but he had a great
contempt for foreigners and Catholics, and prayed for everybody
but the Pope of Rome, whom he chose to typify as a scarlet lady.
The only other remarkable peculiarities about Mr. Dribble, were
his wearing shoes and white cravat. I have heard Mr. Bassett
say that he was an excellent accountant, and honest as the day
was long. The last compliment would be a very flattering one
if pronounced in June, but a very doubtful one in January.</p>

<p>However, I forget now at what season of the year it was that I
heard Mr. Bassett make the remark, but I know that he entertained
the highest opinion of his book-keeper's integrity.</p>

<p>Mr. Dribble lived in the upper part of the city, and when he
went home he took me with him in an omnibus. His house was
one of a long row, all of which were built precisely alike, in a very
genteel street; indeed, the gentility of the neighborhood was so excessive
as to be distressing, and the uniformity of the houses and the
people that inhabited them, were more distressing than all. It was
surprising that each man should know his own house, and his
own family, they were all so nearly alike. Every door had a
silver plate upon it bearing some such name as Brown, Davis, or
Dribble; every little yard had a little sickly pine tree precisely
in its centre, and a little piece of slight trellis-work, painted
green, with a scraggy-looking grape vine trained upon it. The
facade of the block presented a desolate view of green blinds,
and the rear afforded a chilling prospect of piazzas and white
board fences. On the opposite side of the street was a piece of
unimproved property surrounded by a shabby high board fence,
and the ground itself was filled with tall poles, which, upon
inquiry, I learned were young mulberry trees that had been
planted by a speculator in morus multicaulis. The inside of the
book-keeper's house was in admirable keeping with the exterior.
It was most uncomfortably genteel, and most ambitiously shabby.
As you entered the front door, you stepped into a hall so very
narrow that two persons could not stand abreast with comfort;
and yet, notwithstanding the narrowness of it, by the aid of

<!-- Volume I, Page 64 -->

bleak bare walls, a piece of green paper over the sky-light of
the door, and a pair of steep, white pine stairs, with a faint
mahogany-colored balustrade, it had a desolate, uninhabitable
appearance; all the walls were cracked, and the doors very
much shrunk, although some parts of them were too small,
others were too large, and prevented their being shut close. Mr.
Dribble ushered me into the parlor, which had a centre-table
in one corner, on which was placed, in an ostentatious manner,
a lady's magazine and a morocco covered album, filled
with extracts from Mrs. Barbauld and Young's Night Thoughts;
a pair of dismal caricatures of humanity, which were probably
intended for portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Dribble, hung on each
side of the chimney, and on the mantel-piece were two card-racks
in the shape of lyres, constructed of scallop shells and
paste board; there were besides, a very narrow looking-glass
covered with fly-paper, a veneered sofa, with horse hair cushions,
and half a dozen mahogany chairs, arranged cornerwise round
the room so that they should cover the greatest space possible.
To me who was in a course of training for a life of sincere
actions and undisguised thoughts, these palpable attempts at
fraudulent representations, appeared excessively ridiculous and
criminal. Poor Mr. Dribble was probably keeping himself a
miserably poor man by an insane attempt to appear more
prosperous than he really was. His fruitless endeavors to keep
up appearances deceived nobody. Poverty, like murder, will
out, and an honest confession of it deprives it of its ugliest
features. While I sat alone in Mr. Dribble's parlor, I could not
help saying to myself, "What a lying place a great city is! How
all the inhabitants strive to deceive each other, and how useless
are all their endeavors, when I, a simple country boy, can penetrate
so easily the mask with which they disguise themselves."</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Dribble returned, bringing with him Mrs.
Dribble, to whom he introduced me in a formal and solemn manner,
saying:</p>

<p>"My dear, allow me to introduce to your acquaintance my

<!-- Volume I, Page 65 -->

friend, Mr. Tom Pepper, a friend of Mr. Bassett's. Mr. Pepper,
this is Mrs. Dribble, my lady."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dribble curtsied very low and said "How do you do,
sir?" to which I replied, "Very well."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Dribble said, "I hope you will excuse my dress,
sir; for I was busy about some domestic affairs, and Mr. Dribble
would not give me time to put on anything fit to be seen."</p>

<p>Now this was a dreadful bouncer, for I had seen the lady
steal up stairs in a very different dress, and, as I afterwards
learned, the dress that she had on was the best that she owned,
and she took particular pride in it.</p>

<p>After a few general remarks on the weather, and the state of
religion, Mrs. Dribble withdrew, and soon afterwards we were
summoned to the tea-table, which was spread in the basement.</p>

<p>When we sat down to the table, as I was very hungry, I
helped myself immediately to some bread and butter; but Mr.
Dribble closed his eyes and bending over the table, said, in a
low, trembling voice, "For these good creatures of thy most
gracious bounty, make us, O Lord! suitably thankful; consecrate
them to our use, and us to thy service, for Christ's sake."</p>

<p>As I had never witnessed such a ceremony before, it seemed
very strange to me, and I asked Mr. Dribble what the meaning
of it was.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Dribble "we are commanded to do it in the
Bible."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" I said; "I didn't know that before."</p>

<p>"Of course we are," said Mrs. Dribble; "everybody of
any respectability does it.  I am sure I should be afraid me
victuals would choke me lf I didn't ask a blessing. For my
part I think it's the duty of every head of a family, if it were
only to set a good example."</p>

<p>Here the servant girl came in and said that a little girl at the
door wanted to beg some victuals for her mother, who was sick
at home.</p>

<p>"Tell her to go away," said Mrs. Dribble; "we have got

<!-- Volume I, Page 66 -->

nothing to give to beggars. It's as much as we can do to take
care of ourselves these hard times."</p>

<p>The tea was a very good one, for Mrs. Dribble prided herself
on three things: her gentility, her religion, and on being a good
liver.  Not because she was particularly genteel, or religious,
or a great epicure, but because it was highly respectable, and all
the neighbors were genteel&mdash;religious&mdash;good livers.  And she
loved to talk about her housekeeping, her preserves, and her
dinners, and she must always be prepared for a sudden visit
from any of her friends. Mrs. Dribble was the opposite of her
husband in appearance, being tall, thin and flimsy in her make.
But in other respects this excellent couple were very much alike,
and never disagreed upon any occasion. They belonged to the
same church, thought the same thoughts, eat the same food, and
talked the same talk. This harmony did not seem to have been
abnormal with them; but they were of that class of persons,
who, having no particular character of their own, take upon
themselves the character of those with whom they come in contact;
they resembled each other just as they tried to resemble
the rest of the world, and nothing gave them so much uneasiness
as the fear of differing from their neighbors. They belonged to
the most popular party in religion and politics, and conformed to all
fashions that had become universal and well known, so that they
were always dressed in the latest fashion but one, and were called
dowdies by their acquaintances without even suspecting that such
an odious appellation was applied to them. What such people
would do if left upon a desolate island like Robinson Crusoe, it
would be difficult to conceive. With no precedents for their
conduct and nobody to imitate, they would probably try to conform
themselves to the habits of the beasts by which they were
surrounded.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Dribble always addressed each other as "my
dear," and I never found out the Christian name of either, as the
door-plate simply bore the name of DRIBBLE, and at the store he
was never called by any other name than that of book-keeper.

<!-- Volume I, Page 67 -->

But Mr. and Mrs. Dribble were not alone in the world; they
had two children, a boy and a girl, who seemed to reflect each
other, as their parents did, and were, in fact, their parents in
little. The boy, however, resembled his mother, being long,
lank, and flimsily made up, altogether of an unsubstantial and
uncertain appearance; his name was William; the girl had a
strange resemblance to her father, being short, round and
smooth, with light hair, and a perfectly vacant face; her name
was Mary Ann. I could not help contrasting the stagnant quiet
of the Dribble family with the exciting domestic episodes which I
had witnessed at Mr. Bassett's and "Swine's." It was a strange
thing to see a man and wife living together in such perfect harmony;
for I had begun to think that men and their wives made
it a point to disagree about everything, and do all they could to
make each other miserable. But the tranquility which reigned
in my new home was not altogether to my taste; the active
principle of love was lacking, and I used to think that little
Sylvia and I might live together very happily, without being so
dull as Mr. and Mrs. Dribble were.</p>

<p>The little Dribbles went to school every day, and performed
all their duties in the most circumspect manner, like well regulated
machines, but I could never contrive to get up a romp with
Mary Ann, or a fight with her brother; and I was beginning to
wish myself back in the Hague where I was always sure of a
growl from "Swine," and a kiss from pretty little Sylvia, when
I was introduced into a sphere of life entirely new to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett came home with the book-keeper one night, and
after looking carefully up and down the street to see that he was
not watched, entered the house and called me into the front
parlor, wanting, as he said, to speak to me in private. I was so
glad to see him again, that I took his hand and kissed it, and he
returned my affection by patting my head and praising my good
looks. After questioning me about my treatment from the book-keeper's
family, he said: "Tom, how would you like to be a
lawyer?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 68 -->

<p>I could only tell him that I didn't know, as I had never
tried.</p>

<p>"And how would you like to try?" he said.</p>

<p>"Very well," I replied, "if you wish me to."</p>

<p>"That's right, Tom," he said; "I do wish you to, for I wish
to see you grow up a great man as well as a good one. Now,
all great men in this country, Tom, are lawyers.  The President
is a lawyer, the Governor is a lawyer, the Senators are lawyers,
all our Foreign Ambassadors are lawyers, and so are all the
heads of departments at Washington. So you see, Tom, if you
would be a great man, you must first be a lawyer."</p>

<p>It sounded very strangely to me for Mr. Bassett to talk about
my becoming a great man, but as it seemed to give him a good
deal of pleasure, I didn't tell him exactly all that I thought, but
I said that I only wished I could be as great a man as he was.
He pinched my cheek, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! my poor boy. You will be a greater man than I, for
you will be truthful and honest; and you will have the benefit
of an education, which was denied to me, and you will not be
harassed and dwarfed by the cares of business and the annoyances
of a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A wife?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Tom," he said, "never mind; I forgot what I
wanted to say. Now, my dear boy, I have tried to impress upon
your mind the importance of Truth, and you have profited by my
lessons; but I have conceived a plan for promoting your happiness,
and laying the foundation of your future greatness, and you
must try and second my efforts. I wish to make a lawyer of
you, that you may be called the honest lawyer. This will not
only be fame in itself, but it will be the means of procuring for
you the best business in the country; and as soon as it becomes
known that you are an honest lawyer, they will want to send you
to Congress, where you will become still more renowned as the
honest Member of Congress, and from that you will of course rise
to other and higher stations; and, my dear boy, when I am old, I

<!-- Volume I, Page 69 -->

will point to you with pride and say: that's my boy, the honest
lawyer!"</p>

<p>"My boy!" Ah! how little he knew what a tumult those
words caused in my heart! I was on the point of asking him if
I were in reality, his boy, when he went on, as follows:</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom, it will be the delight of my heart to hear you
called the celebrated honest lawyer. And do you think that you
will love me then, and remember me?"</p>

<p>I pressed his hand, and said I knew I should never cease to
love him.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear boy," he said, "I have secured you a place
in the office of Jasper Ferocious, Esq.; he will instruct you in
the elements of the noble science, and by the time that you arrive
at the age of twenty-one, you will have passed the number of
years in an attorney's office which the laws of our State require
before you can be admitted, to practice at the bar, and then, my
boy, you will be an esquire.  In the morning I will send the
book-keeper with you to the office of Mr. Ferocious, and you can
begin your studies."</p>

<p>He then kissed me and bade me good night, and left me in
quite a bewildered state of mind; for I had but a vague idea of
what it was to study the law, and I could hardly stretch my mind
forward to the time when I should become an Esquire. The
only lawyer of whom I had any knowledge, was the 'Squire in
Apponagansett, a most formidable personage, in the shape of a
weazen-faced old gentleman, who wore a bob wig, white as
snow, a little cocked hat, black velvet knee-breeches, and a
whale-bone cane. This was my beau ideal of a lawyer, and
such a person I supposed that I must become myself before I
could be endowed with all the privileges of the profession. But
my opinion on this subject underwent a very violent change,
when I was introduced to Mr. Ferocious, by the book-keeper, the
next morning.</p>

<p>The office of that gentleman was in the third story of a high
building in Pine street; it was very small, very dusty and very

<!-- Volume I, Page 70 -->

dark. It smelt uncomfortably, and looked extremely unpleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferocious was a small gentleman, dressed in a fancy
cravat and a pair of steel-bowed spectacles; when I was presented
to him by the book-keeper, he sat at his little shabby
writing desk, with a pen in his hand, and his eyes fixed on a
sheet of blank paper.</p>

<p>"Ah! you're my student," said Mr. Ferocious; "very well.
Sit down in the outer office, if you please; I will have some
conversation with you directly. An idea has just occurred to
me which I wish to commit to paper."</p>

<p>"If you will have the goodness&mdash;&mdash;" said Mr. Dribble, and he was
going to say something else, when Mr. Ferocious suddenly interrupted
him:</p>

<p>"When one individual calls upon another, of course I do not
mean you, Dribble, and finds that individual engaged in committing
to paper an important thought, in which the better life of the
country may be involved, together with the interests of sundry
inhabitants of this country, hoping well and wishing well, the
least that he could do in the way of civility, would be to wait
that individual's pleasure to be addressed."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the book-keeper; "I meant no
offence."</p>

<p>"Of course. I didn't mean you," said Mr. Ferocious; "it
was merely an incidental remark I made; but you can wait, if
you please, in the outer office, until I am disengaged."</p>

<p>So Mr. Ferocious seated himself at his desk again, with his
countenance as blank as the sheet of paper lying before him, and
Mr. Dribble took himself off and left me alone in the outer office,
which contained nothing more than an old table, partly covered
with faded moreen, a rickety chair, and half a dozen little
square boxes, made in a very substantial manner, as though they
were designed to contain something very heavy and very precious.
The outer office was separated from the inner one, where
Mr. Ferocious sat, by a thin partition, and a door with a window

<!-- Volume I, Page 71 -->

in it, I sat here alone for about an hour, when Mr. Ferocious
opened the door and summoned me into his presence.</p>

<p>"So, you want to study law?" said Mr. Ferocious.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bassett wants I should," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah! Very good. Stop a minute; let me put that down,
it's a good idea. Young man studies law because his guardian
wants him to. And your name?"</p>

<p>"Tom Pepper," I replied.</p>

<p>"Tom Pepper! That's Good," said Mr. Ferocious; "individual,
national, indigenous, capital, and spicy, too. Do you
remember whether anybody has ever made a pun upon your
name?"</p>

<p>I did not. In truth, I had to discover my want of education
by confessing that I didn't know what a pun was. This seemed
to give a good deal of satisfaction to Mr. Ferocious who took up
his pen again and made another memorandum.</p>

<p>"Spicy, decidedly! Home, home made. Pepper!" said Mr.
Ferocious. "Do you read, Mr. Pepper, imaginative literature,
the home article, or foreign trash, in pink covers?"</p>

<p>I merely replied negatively, in a general way, to these inquiries,
not understanding very clearly their precise import.</p>

<p>"Ingenuous, individual, and characteristic," said Mr. Ferocious,
speaking to himself, and looking earnestly through his
glasses at nothing in particular. "National, idiosyncratic, and
peculiar. A certain individual, Mr. Pepper, or Thomas, rather;
mind, I name no names; author of a certain work, indigenous,
and born of the better life of the country, has a natural desire, or
rather a patriotic wish to test the real, homogenous, distinct,
separate qualities of that production. Now, it strikes me that
that individual, mind, I name no names, may safely, securely
and properly trust his work in your hands for an opinion.
Young, unsophisticated, a real true American, and free from all
foreign influences, your opinion must be fresh, home-born, and
congenial with the better life of the country. Bold, bold, decidedly
bold!" said Mr. Ferocious, making pokes at the air with

<!-- Volume I, Page 72 -->

his fore-finger. "Rather bold attempt and, upon the whole,
fortunate."</p>

<p>Rising from his chair, and opening a box in one corner of his
office, Mr. Ferocious took out a pamphlet with yellow covers,
which he put into my hands.  "You needn't look at the author's
name. He is an individual who has done something for the
honor of his country, producing its better life in certain plays,
novels, romances, poems, and essays. An individual, I say,
nothing more; I name no names. But read his works; dig into
them, get at their better life, dive into the ocean of their meaning
and bring up the pearls of thought that lie at the bottom. But don't
say anything to anybody about it. Keep dark, dark, dark. Say
nothing. Remember the book was given to you by an individual.
No matter who, I name no names&mdash;close, close."</p>

<p>All this was said very rapidly, and with a good deal of earnestness.</p>

<p>"Now sit down at your desk. There, refresh yourself with
the better life of the country; true, native, real, genuine, American
literature;" and, seating me at the table in the outer office,
he opened the book before me at the first chapter, which professed
to give the "Life, Adventures, Fortunes and Fooleries, of Christopher
Cockroach, Citizen." Then Mr. Ferocious brought a
sheep-skin covered book from his desk, which was called Chitty's
Blackstone.</p>

<p>"Now," said my instructor in the mysteries of law, "when
anybody comes in, put Blackstone on top, and when they go out
bring up old Kit, Kit Cockroach, you see," and Mr. Ferocious
placed the books before me, first putting one on top and then the
other. "But don't laugh loud, when there's anybody in the private
office. Dark, sly, quiet, close, decidedly close."</p>

<p>There was a noise of somebody at the door, and Mr. Ferocious
immediately placed Blackstone on top of the better life of the
country. Another gentleman now entered, who shook Mr. Ferocious
by the hands.</p>

<p>"Tibbings, how are you?" said Mr. Ferocious.  "Sit down;

<!-- Volume I, Page 73 -->

this is my new student, Tom Pepper. Spicy name, isn't it?
Fresh, vigorous, new, indigenous."</p>

<p>"Them's something piquant and racy in it, as you say," replied
Mr. Tibbings, rapping his leg nervously with a slender ebony
stick, which he carried in his hand.</p>

<p>"His name would sound well in a magazine, wouldn't it?"
said Mr. Ferocious.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, exactly," said  Mr. Tibbings, "it is
rather suggestive of Tom Jones. I am in favor of a pure, vigorous,
national literature. There's a want of picturesqueness in
the name of Tom, too, it's rather low. The people want something
that is bold, vigorous, and original.  Anything new in the
magazines?"</p>

<p>"Trash, trash, stale, old tea leaves," replied Mr. Ferocious.</p>

<p>"Here's something new," said Mr. Tibbings, pulling a blue-colored
pamphlet from his pocket; "The Weekly Cab"</p>

<p>"Cab, Cab, Cab," said  Mr. Ferocious; " 'twon't do, English,
Foreign, Cockney.  What we want, Tibbings, is a pure, bold,
original, strong, vigorous, indigenous, and native literature;
something that has the better life of the country in it, fresh and
racy."</p>

<p>"That's a capital idea of yours, Ferocious, in the sixty-fifth
chapter of the Cockroach, where the oyster rises up in the night
and makes a journey through Ann street. It has a national
look with it."</p>

<p>"Tibbings, there's a certain individual, I name no names,"
said Mr. Ferocious, "who despises praise. What the country
wants is a bold, clear, strong, sagacious critic, to point out an
author's faults."</p>

<p>"If he have any," said Tibbings.</p>

<p>"If he have any! Yes. That's well added," said Mr. Ferocious.
"If he have any. The better life of the country wants
nourishing, bringing out, strengthening. But what's this, Tibbings!
I see through it all.  This paper has been established
to inflict an assassin-like stab on the native literature of this hopeful

<!-- Volume I, Page 74 -->

country. A certain individual, I don't mean you, Tibbings,
of course, obtains a paper containing a slanderous, malicious, assassin-like
attack on a certain author, who has done his country
some service in certain plays, poems, novels, essays and romances&mdash;that
individual brings that paper into the very office of
the author assailed, and places it in his hands."</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Tibbings, turning very red in the face.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Malice, malice, assassins, bought up by the enemies of a
sound, healthful, indigenous, national, home literature," said Mr.
Ferocious, in a hasty and excited manner. "That paper, Tibbings,
contains an attack on a certain author, I don't say whom,
I name no names. Perhaps a certain individual don't know
anything about it. But it's very plain. There's a conspiracy
of those freebooting barons that go prowling on the high seas of
literature, hoping to destroy the prospects of a certain author.
But it won't do. A certain author glories in such persecutions.
Ha! hear what he says: 'Christopher Cockroach is the most
stupid book in the world!' "</p>

<p>"It's shameful!" said Tibbings; "the country shall hear
of it."</p>

<p>"Shameful!" exclaimed Mr. Ferocious, tearing the paper to
pieces, and dancing round the little office; "fiends! murderers!
villains! The most stupid book in the world! If they had said
one of the most stupid, it would have been nothing; but the most
stupid!"</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Mr. Tibbings; "it will do you good in
the end. It's a good thing to be talked about."</p>

<p>"A certain author, Tibbings," said Mr. Ferocious, dropping
suddenly into his seat, "has no desire for notoriety. It's all plain
to me; there's a conspiracy, a wicked, shameful, assassin-like
conspiracy to destroy the literature of the country."</p>

<p>The door of the inner office being partly open, I sat in my
chair at the little ragged table, looking in great amazement upon
the excited actions of Mr. Ferocious, who appeared to be quite

<!-- Volume I, Page 75 -->

frantic at something which was said in the paper that his friend
Tibbings gave him about the very book which he had given me
to read as a kind of sandwich to Chitty's Blackstone. On turning
to the title-page of Christopher Cockroach, I found that the certain
individual hinted at by Mr. Ferocious, as having a desire to
know my opinion of that work was no other than himself. I found
on closer examination that the work was dedicated to his friend
Tibbings, who was then sitting in his office. Mr. Tibbings was
a slender looking gentleman, with a very boyish face, and light
hair.</p>

<p>He seemed to be afraid of Mr. Ferocious, and sat timidly in
his chair, nursing the head of his little ebony stick, and blushing
very red, while my new master gave a terrific loose to his
passions, and glared through his glasses in a manner quite
frightful. I was not much frightened, however, myself, by the
denunciations of Mr. Ferocious as they were all directed against
certain individual assassins, barons, and malicious people not
within striking distance. I knew that I had done nothing myself
to excite his anger, and felt perfectly safe. Poor Mr. Tibbings,
however, had no doubt been guilty of offending a certain author,
by having been the unconscious bearer of an attack upon his
book, and he had to sit and hear himself alluded to in no very
delicate terms, as a certain individual who was no better than an
assassin, and a marauding, piratical baron. After a while, the
wrath of a certain individual expired of its own accord, and then
that individual became as gentle as a sucking lamb, and sat
quietly down and began to discuss literary topics with another
individual, all of whose opinions were exact echoes of his own.
As my own knowledge of literature was very limited, I could
not take much interest in the conversation of Mr. Ferocious and
his friend Tibbings, so I made a beginning upon the Adventures
of Christopher Cockroach, Citizen, and experienced such a soothing
effect from the perusal of a few sentences, that I fell directly
into a sweet slumber, with my head resting upon the open page
of that remarkable production. I do not exactly know how long

<!-- Volume I, Page 76 -->

I slept, but I was suddenly aroused from my slumbers by a sharp
pain in one of my ears, and starting up, I perceived Mr. Ferocious
glaring at me through his spectacles. Mr. Tibbings had
left, and no other clients had come in, so we were alone.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Ferocious, "is that the way you attend to
your studies?  Young America, sir, must keep his eyes open;
he must study deep, dive down into the mysteries of his author;
grapple with him; bring up the pearls and diamonds of his
fancy, and play with his leviathan thoughts. How do you like
old Christopher? Amusing, exciting, absorbing, ha!"</p>

<p>I assured Mr. Ferocious that I was quite unable to get along
with Christopher Cockroach, and begged him to give me something
else to study that would keep me awake.</p>

<p>"Keep you awake! you little sleepy-headed assassin!"
exclaimed Mr. Ferocious; "keep you awake! why the thunders
of Niagara Falls wouldn't keep such a dreaming, dozing, sleepy
numskull awake. A certain author, who has written plays,
romances, essays and novels, places one of his various writings
in the hands of a poor, ignorant sluggard, hoping well and wishing
well, when that illiterate and assassin-like dunce, who hasn't
got sufficient critical ability to discuss the merits of an original
work, falls into a profound slumber, because he hasn't life enough
to keep awake and then attributes his own want of sense to that
author's productions. Avaunt! Hell not the quiet of this
office!</p>

<p>Mr. Ferocious was so highly excited, that I was at last terrified
by his manner, and not comprehending the exact meaning of his
objurgations, and fearing that he might have some murderous
intentions, I caught up my cap, and ran down stairs into the
street. I resolved not to trust myself alone with another enraged
author, and felt sure that Mr. Bassett would laugh good naturedly
when I should tell him of the occurrences in the office of Mr.
Ferocious. Being past the dinner hour at the book-keeper's, I
hurried home in anticipation of a cold dinner; but I was very
hungry, and didn't care for that. I rang the bell, and directly

<!-- Volume I, Page 77 -->

the servant came to the door with my little trunk in her hand,
and told me I mustn't come there again, that Mr. Bassett was
dead, and I must go and find a home somewhere else. She
then dropped the trunk on the stoop, and without saying another
word shut the door in my face.

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p>MY benefactor dead! I heard nothing else distinctly, and
cared little for being turned into the street. There was no selfishness
in my grief, for I loved him tenderly, and had no fears
for the future. Seating myself upon my trunk I gave way to
my feelings, and wept loud and long, until at last the servant
came to the door again and told me to go away, and
make no more noise. My heart was bursting, but I felt too
proud to remain where I was not wanted, and I took my trunk on
my shoulder, for it contained but a few thin clothes, and left the
stoop of the book-keeper's house. But whither should I go? or
where find an asylum, now that my only friend was dead? My
feelings would have taken me to his house, but fear of his wife
kept me away. It would have been a happiness to me to see
him before he was buried, but this was a privilege which I knew
would be denied me. It was growing late in the day, and I continued
to walk down town, crying as I went, and stopping to rest
when I was tired, in some out-of-the-way place, until just after
the lamps in the shops were lighted, I reached that part of
Broadway where the hotel was in which I had once slept. I had
some money in my pocket, and being now very weary, and, in
spite of my grief, very hungry, I thought I would ask for some
supper and a lodging at my old hotel. I entered the bar-room
with my trunk on my shoulder, and asked the bar-keeper if he
would give me something to eat and a bed.</p>

<p>The bar keeper looked at me earnestly a moment or two, and

<!-- Volume I, Page 78 -->

exclaimed: "Hollo! mister; you are the very chap I want to
see. Come here!"</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" I said.</p>

<p>"You are the youngster that slept here once, are you not?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, there has been the devil to pay about you. It's deuced
lucky for me that I have found you. Come here!"</p>

<p>The bar-keeper was coming towards me, but I had taken
alarm at his earnest manner, and his saying there had been the
devil to pay about me; knowing that I had no friend to trust in
now, but my legs, I dropped my trunk and ran.</p>

<p>"Stop that boy! stop that boy!" shouted the bar-keeper, as he
ran after me, followed by a dozen waiters. The streets were
crowded with people, and I had great difficulty in making my
way, but I dashed under horses' legs, between omnibusses and
cabs, and succeeded in reaching the opposite side of the street,
where, finding the way more clear, I ran with all my might.
But the bar-keeper and the waiters followed shouting out, "Stop
him! stop him!" until just as I was going to turn down into
Wall street, a boy put out his foot and tripped me up. Before I
could recover myself, the bar-keeper caught me by the collar of
my jacket, and calling some of the waiters to his assistance, they
bore me off to the hotel, but not without receiving half a dozen
kicks from my heels.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, you little fool!" said the bar-keeper.
"You will not be hurt. But you are good to me for fifty dollars,
and I am not going to let you go. Come along, my fine fellow,
and give up squirming."</p>

<p>Finding that it would be idle to resist any longer, I told them
to let me walk and I would promise not to escape. But he said,
"No, no, my fine fellow: I have caught you and mean to keep
you." So they carried me back in their arms, every one of
them appearing anxious to have hold of me. As they took me
into the hotel an old gentleman in spectacles met us at the door;

<!-- Volume I, Page 79 -->

"What," said he, looking curiously at me, "is that the young
rascal there has been such a noise about?"</p>

<p>"It isn't anybody else, I can tell you," replied the bar-keeper.</p>

<p>"Well, take him up to the Captain's parlor," said the old gentleman,
"he's waiting for him there."</p>

<p>All this had occurred so rapidly that I had had no time to think
what it all meant, and as they took me up the stairs of the hotel, I
felt terribly frightened. I was not conscious of having done anything
wrong, but the harsh treatment I had received at the book-keeper's
house had rendered me timid, and I remember that the
thought occurred to me that it would not do now to speak my
mind too plainly, for I had no friend to protect me from the consequences
of thinking in too transparent a manner. So I resolved
to be cautious and give no offence to anybody.</p>

<p>They took me up stairs to the third floor, and opening a
chamber door, sat me down in a small room, which was occupied
by a stout-looking, middle-aged gentleman, who clasped his
hands together as soon as he saw me, and said "My God! it is
he; what a likeness!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a pretty race I have had after him," said the bar-keeper;
"but it takes me to know a chap after I have eyed him
once."</p>

<p>"I should have known him," said the gentleman, "if I had
met him on the top of Chimborazo."</p>

<p>"So should I," said one of the waiters; "I knew him all to
pieces as soon as I caught sight of him."</p>

<p>"As to knowing him," said another, "I knowed he'd be
cotched to-day, because I felt it in my bones, and I tolt Pat Donovan
so this morning when I took up the captain's breakfast.
Didn't I, Pat?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sure, you may say that with truth," said Pat, "only it
was me that said it til you."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongues, every one of you!" said the bar-keeper,
"nobody saw the boy but myself.  I knew him and gave chase
to him, and the reward is mine."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 80 -->

<p>"You shall have it," said the gentleman, and taking out his
pocket-book he reached the bar-keeper some bills.</p>

<p>"All right, all right" said he: "and what shall I do with
the young fellow's baggage? he said he wanted some supper and
a bed."</p>

<p>"Then send up his trunk, and supper for both of us," said the
gentleman; "So, be so good as to leave us alone." The bar-keeper
immediately retired, followed by the waiters; but as they
went out the old gentleman in the glasses, who had met us below,
came in.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain, this is the very boy, is it&mdash;I think so?" said
the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, for so they all called the gentleman,
"I should have known him in Timbuctoo."</p>

<p>"Well, he is really a fine looking little fellow," said the old
gentleman, feeling of my arms; "quite a stout piece of a boy.
There's something curious, though, about his coming here again,
isn't there? Well, good night, Captain."</p>

<p>"Good night to you," said the Captain, as the old gentleman
retired.</p>

<p>"And so, my lad," said the gentleman "you were going to
lodge here to-night? Well, you won't object to eating a bit of
supper with me, will you?"</p>

<p>The kindness of his manner and the tones of his voice, for some
reason quite beyond my power to explain, had a strange effect
upon me&mdash;perhaps they recalled the image of my dead benefactor,
or of my mother, but let it have been what it might, I was
strongly affected and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my lad," he said, "you must belay that, or I
shall be pumping away myself," and drawing me towards him
he wiped away my tears and told me to cheer up. I looked up
in his face and discovered a tear trickling down his own cheek,
which only caused me to break out afresh.</p>

<p>But supper was brought up very soon, and the smell of a
mutton chop and the sight of a smoking tea-pot, had an immediate

<!-- Volume I, Page 81 -->

effect upon my grief. I ceased crying instantly, and without
any delay drew a chair up to the little table.</p>

<p>"Now, my lad," said the Captain, "eat hearty and you will
feel better. A ship wants plenty of ballast to keep on an even
keel in a squall. Look out, you young rogue, you will scald
your tongue with that hot tea. That's right, pay away; there's
no allowance. Why, my lad, you eat as though you were
hungry."</p>

<p>I told him that I was, as I had eaten nothing since morning.</p>

<p>"Ha! I am glad of it" he said; "I like to see you eat hearty.
Take another roll, my lad; stow it away. Here's another tender
bit of mutton: don't spare the butter, nor the milk. Ha! ha!
ha! But that's capital. Eat away. I would rather see you
stow away the grub after that fashion than eat myself, my lad."
And the Captain reached across the table and patted me
encouragingly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I tell you how it is, my lad," he said, "there's a hand of
Providence in this meeting. You don't know it, but I do. As
I sit and look at you, my heart swells as though it would
burst. Do you know, my little admiral, that you saved my
life once?"</p>

<p>I assured him that I had not the most remote suspicion of such
a thing, and that I thought he must have mistaken me for some
other person.</p>

<p>"Mistaken you!" he exclaimed; "no, my lad; your image
is here, here," and he placed his hand upon his breast; "I saw
you before you were born. You may open your eyes lad,
but it is true. You can't know anything about it, though. No,
that's a secret. But, eat, eat away. Don't give up so soon, you
will spoil all my pleasure."</p>

<p>I told him that I could eat no more, and must stop. He
then ordered the table to be removed, and seating himself near me,
gazed at my face until I felt quite abashed. He sighed
deeply, rose from his seat and paced the chamber back and
forth for sometime, without speaking. This gave me an opportunity

<!-- Volume I, Page 82 -->

of observing him more closely than I had done. His
manner towards me had been altogether so strange, and his saying
that I had saved his life, had excited my curiosity to the
highest degree, so that I was impatient to know something more
about him, and to learn the cause of the interest which he seemed
to take in me. I felt my heart warm towards him every minute,
and almost forgot Mr. Bassett and my grief at his loss. The
Captain was an exceedingly good looking person, and quite the
reverse of Mr. Bassett in everything but his apparent kindness.
He appeared to me about forty; he was of middle height and
rather stout; he wore no whiskers, and his complexion was
brownish and ruddy, his hair was dark and curly, his eyes were
a deep blue, and his mouth had an expression of singular sweetness.
He was dressed with scrupulous neatness, in a suit of
blue cloth, and a black vest and cravat.</p>

<p>After pacing the floor in silence for a long time, he stopped and
sat down close by me, and after looking intently in my face, he
said, "I see it there, and yet I am afraid to know. I will prolong
my dream to-night, at least. It will be time enough for disappointment
to-morrow. Did you ever see me before, lad?
Don't you think that you know me?"</p>

<p>I assured him that I had no recollection of ever having
seen him before, and was quite certain that I did not know him.</p>

<p>"I fear so," he said; "but stand up here, let me feel your heart
beat against mine; let me see if they respond to each other."
He held me tightly to his breast, so that I could feel his heart
throb distinctly. "Now, lad," he said, "do you feel anything?"</p>

<p>I replied that I felt his heart beat.</p>

<p>"Ah, lad! you can feel it beat, but you cannot feel its feelings,"
he said; "and you don't remember having seen me
before, but I remember you. It was only a glimpse that I
caught of your face; but it was enough. Do you not remember
when you slept here one night, months ago, how you went into
another chamber at midnight and woke somebody who was
groaning from the effects of the nightmare?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 83 -->

<p>I recollected the circumstance, of course, although I had
entirely forgotten it until now, and looking at him closely, I perceived
that this was the person whom I found.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was me that you saved," he said; "I should have
died but for you, lad; I knew that I was going; I felt it; and
O, the horror of it, which I cannot tell you, and you could not
feel if I should. I woke from death and saw the face of an angel
sent from Heaven to save me; yes, lad, the face of an angel!
And I lay awake all night thinking of it, dreading to sleep again,
and hoping to see that face once more. In the morning I found
that my door had been opened; but I could not find that anybody
had been in my room, unless it were a boy that, they said, had
slept in the next apartment, and he was gone. I looked for him
through all the streets, I advertised for him, I hunted in all the
by-places and boarding-houses in the city. I offered rewards for
his discovery; I travelled all over the country trying to find him;
I prayed for him; I sought for him wherever I could penetrate;
but I was doomed to disappointment, and in despair of ever seeing
him again, I had prepared to leave the country, and after
to-morrow I could never have seen him: never! But here he is
before me. Yes, lad, it is you. But don't tell me where you
have been; don't tell me where you have come from, to-night.
It will be time enough to-morrow. I must dream once more.
Now, lad, let us go to bed; I have been weary, watching; I
have been afraid to sleep, but now I can lie down peaceably
and dream. But promise me that you will not leave me in the
morning without seeing me. Remember, lad, the
happiness of a human being depends upon my seeing you
again."</p>

<p>I promised him that I would not leave him; and, indeed; I
began, now, to be apprehensive that he might leave me. There
was something in his manner, his voice, looks, and every movement,
that seemed natural and familiar, and I felt already that I
had found a new friend, and one who was nearer to me than Mr.
Bassett.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 84 -->

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p>I LAY in the same room in which I had slept before, adjoining
that of my new friend; and when I awoke in the morning I hurried
on my clothes, and opening his door stepped softly in and
found him still sound asleep. I sat down upon the chair at the
head of his bed, and gazed upon his placid features with a feeling
of awe. It seemed to me that I had seen his face before in
my dreams, and a sense of some past acquaintance with him, but
when or where I could not tell, quite bewildered me. He had a
broad, smooth forehead, and dark, glossy hair, which, although it
was cut very close, clung in crisp curls to his temples; he
breathed as gently as a child, and a sweet smile played round
his half open mouth. As I sat and gazed upon him, every
moment his features grew more and more familiar, until I knew
that I had seen him before. Presently he opened his eyes and
looked at me a minute or two in silence.</p>

<p>"Ah, lad!" he said, "I knew in my sleep that you were sitting
there; I have not enjoyed such refreshing slumbers this
many a day." He then sat up in bed, and taking my hand, said,
"Come, now, tell me your name."</p>

<p>I had already determined not to acknowledge the name of
Pepper again; it had subjected me to so much ridicule, and I
had experienced so much inconvenience from not being able to
tell the name of my father, that I had also determined to invent a
paternal name until I should find one that I was entitled to. I
had some misgivings about telling a falsehood, but I quieted my
conscience with the reflection that if I lied from a good motive,
there could be no harm in it; and I had found that it was quite
impracticable to be as transparent as Mr. Bassett had required
of me. In short, I first made up my mind to tell a falsehood, and
then convinced myself that I was justified in doing it. Surely,
there could be no harm in changing my name. Of what consequence
was it to anybody in the world whether I called myself

<!-- Volume I, Page 85 -->

Tom Pepper or Matthew Mustard, or any other name, spicy or
otherwise? Clearly, it was nobody's business: neither could
the circumstance of calling some imaginary being my father, do
anybody the least harm; and as I didn't know who my father
was, I might by accident, light upon his real name.  My first
impulse was to claim Mr. Bassett for my father, and assume his
name, but I thought that I might, by so doing, get myself into
some trouble with his widow, whom I hoped never to see again;
so I hastily adopted a name that I saw on a sign the day before,
and replied coolly, though not without a tingling in my cheeks,
and a quickened pulsation, "Bedford Horton."</p>

<p>"Ah, my lad!" said my new friend "it is as I feared," and
shutting his eyes he fell back upon his pillow.</p>

<p>This puzzled me more than anything that had happened.
Was it possible that he had anticipated that my name was Bedford
Horton, when I had not anticipated it myself much more
than a minute? But there was no help for it now. I had baptized
myself with a new name, and I must abide by it. I repeated
it again lest I should forget it. "Bedford Horton."</p>

<p>"Well, lad," said my friend, raising himself in bed again, with
a sadder look than he had worn before, "was that your father's
name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"And where are your father and mother?" he said.</p>

<p>"Dead, dead," I said, bursting into tears, for I could not yet
speak of my mother's death without crying.</p>

<p>"Poor lad! poor lad!" he said; "and whither are you bound,
and where is your home?"</p>

<p>Having persuaded myself that there could be so great harm
in inventing a name, it was no difficult matter to persuade myself
that I should be quite justifiable in exercising my inventive
powers to the extent of furnishing myself with a home and a birth
place; so, I said that my home was in Boston, where I was born,
that I was not bound anywhere in particular, being on the look
out for a fortune, with but a few shillings in my pocket, and was

<!-- Volume I, Page 86 -->

quite indifferent whither I went, having no friends, and no
prospects of employment.</p>

<p>"Well, lad," he said, "you have saved my life and given me
one pleasant dream. The least I can do is to save yours, and if
I do not give you a pleasant dream in return, the fault will not
be mine. I like you. There is something in that face which
brings the dead to life again. Will you live with me; lad, and
let me be your father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I replied eagerly, and taking his hand I pressed
it to my lips. "O, yes, I shall be too happy!"

<p>"Then call me father," he said, "and I will call you son.
You are not ashamed to change your name, lad?"</p>

<p>"No, no," I replied with a blush.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my boy, you shall be called Bedford no more;
you shall have my name. A good British name, lad, it is;
more than a thousand years old and still without a blot.
Now, reach me that sword."</p>

<p>I reached him a sword which hung suspended from the wall
near the head of his bed, and as he drew it from its scabbard,
I started back in alarm as he held the glittering blade above his
head.</p>

<p>"What, lad!" said he, "do you start at the sight of a sword?
Nay, that must not be if you wear the name of my ancestors.
Kneel, now, at the side of my bed. Never flinch, lad."</p>

<p>I knelt as he told me, and closed my eyes, with a misgiving
that the next moment I should feel my head drop from my
shoulders. But, instead, I felt the back of the sword upon my
neck.</p>

<p>"Rise, Eustace St. Hugh!" said my new father. "Now,
embrace me." I put my arms around his neck, and he kissed
me. "Now, lad, you are a St. Hugh, and a gentleman, and
remember that the name which you can claim as your own was
never coupled with dishonor. Leave me now, lad; go down
into the parlor and wait until I come; we will breakfast
together."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 87 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p>NOW, I was supremely happy. My name was Tom Pepper
no longer; and when anybody said to me, "Who is your
father?" I could boldly reply, "Captain St. Hugh;" and there
was no Mrs. St. Hugh to be jealous of the kindness shown me,
or to interfere with my pleasures. The Captain was quite a
different person from Mr. Bassett; he was not more kind to me,
but he allowed me to do as I pleased, and never exacted of me
that inconvenient transparency of thinking which was such a
hobby with my first friend. He was himself, blunt enough, and
always spoke his feelings with sufficient honesty, but it was
natural with him, and he appeared, too, to think that nobody
ever had a disposition to do otherwise. He was the very soul of
honor, and I never reflected upon the gross deceit which I had
practiced towards him, without a burning sense of shame. But
I had committed the fault and could not mend it, or at least, I
thought I could not. And, then, I used to reproach myself for
disowning my poor old grandfather Pepper, who had been a
father to me as long as he lived, and I had deprived myself of the
pleasure of telling the Captain about my mother, how good and
beautiful she was, how she had loved me, and how sadly and
suddenly she died. I regretted this the more because he used to
take a peculiar delight in making me repeat every circumstance
of my early life, and every particular respecting my parents, all
of which I had to invent to make all parts of my story agree.
If I had anticipated how intimate I should become with the
Captain, and if I could have known how little he cared who and
what my parents were, I should, of course, have told him the
truth in the beginning. But all these <i>ifs</i> come too late after the
lie has been told. I felt the importance of Mr. Bassett's
principle, but I had become so deeply involved in my own snares,
that I saw no way of escaping from them. These reflections did
not trouble me much, but they were the only draw-backs to my

<!-- Volume I, Page 88 -->

pleasures, and but for them I should have been perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Captain St. Hugh remained at the hotel only a few days after
our first meeting; he then removed to a seat which he rented at
Bloomingdale, on the banks of the Hudson; it was a large, old-fashioned,
wooden house, with a Grecian portico, painted a
bright lemon color, and with green Venetian blinds to all the
windows. Between the river and the house there was an
orchard, filled with a variety of apple and pear trees, and in the
rear was the kitchen garden, and a large conservatory, and a
grape-house paved with marble, both of which had been very
much neglected. At the foot of the orchard there was a landing
and a boat-house, and, better than all, a boat with oars and sails.
Here Captain St. Hugh and myself used to spend a good many
hours, sailing on the river and fishing. There was an old
dilapidated summer-house in the orchard too, having a view of
the river, where we used to sit and watch the steamboats and
other river-craft as they glided past, I with a book, and he with
a cigar and a newspaper; and then he would tell me long stories
about the St. Hughs, a number of brave men who had borne
the name, and gained distinction in battle; but most of all, he
delighted to tell me of Sir Eustace St. Hugh, whose name he
had bestowed upon me; his own name was Charles John. This
Sir Eustace was his great grandfather, a most valiant and honorable
soldier, who had fought innumerable battles, and acquired a
large fortune, which he had expended in the purchase of an
estate in England, having a castle and a very grand park, called
Blackmere. The Captain, or rather my father, for so I called
him now, and he called me his son, had a miniature of this grand
old Sir Eustace, set in gold and surrounded with diamonds,
which he showed me a good many times, and pointed out a
remarkable resemblance which I bore to the brave old soldier,
particularly in my nose, which was a rather prominent feature
in my face, being aquiline in its shape. Next to telling me
about his own family, he seemed to delight most in asking me
about mine. This troubled me a good deal, for as I invented

<!-- Volume I, Page 89 -->

everything that I told him, I had to keep a strict watch upon
myself to prevent his discovering my falsehood. Although he
never preached to me about telling the truth, as Mr. Bassett did,
yet I soon discovered that he valued his word more than he did
his life or his money; and that he held everybody whose honor
was sullied by deceit, in unmeasured contempt. He was continually
telling me of the noble virtues of old Sir Eustace, and
holding him up to me as the model after which I should form
myself. So that I was in a constant state of alarm lest I should
be discovered by some one who had seen me while I was under
the protection of Mr. Bassett, and all my falsehoods exposed;
for I knew that my father would be grieved at my wickedness,
if he didn't instantly discard me; and I should be compelled to
relinquish the grand name of old Sir Eustace, and take that of
Tom Pepper again.</p>

<p>Among the many acts of kindness which my new father
showed me, he presented me with an agate seal, having the arms
of the St. Hugh family engraved upon it; he also had an exact
copy of the portrait of old Sir Eustace painted and enclosed in a
gold case, but not set with diamonds, which he gave me. He
would not send me to school, but he hired a schoolmaster in the
neighborhood to give me lessons in Latin and mathematics, and
he taught me French himself. He purchased a pony for me,
and never seemed so happy as when he could surprise me by an
anticipated gift. The house in which we lived belonged to a
gentleman who was travelling in Europe with his family: it was
rented ready furnished, and the gardener and his wife, who had
lived many years on the place, were all the servants that were
employed. We never saw any company, and the schoolmaster
was the only person who visited the house. I had the liberty to go
where I pleased, but I found so many sources of amusement at
home that, excepting when I took a ride upon my pony, I never
left our own grounds. The room in which I slept opened into
the one occupied by my father, who would not allow the door to
be closed at night, lest he should be troubled again with the

<!-- Volume I, Page 90 -->

night-mare, and I should not hear him. Although he was
generally in a happy humor, and talked and laughed with me
freely, yet at times, he seemed sullen, dispirited, and gloomy,
and if I spoke to him, he would either remain silent, or answer
me in an impatient, testy manner. Those gloomy fits did not
last long, and when he came out of them he would be unusually
kind to me, as though he wished to make me forget his
sullenness.</p>

<p>I remember on one occasion he had been more sullen and
reserved than I had ever seen him before, and at night he had
even closed the door which communicated with my room, on
going to bed. This touched me to the quick, for I thought that
he intended to shun me, that he was getting tired of my company,
and it gave me more anger than grief. I had been under his
care so long, and had received so many proofs of his affection,
that I no longer felt any gratitude for his favors, but began to
look upon them as my due, like any other spoilt child. But the
next day, as I went to go into the summer-house, I found him
sitting there, and was going to withdraw when he called me to him.</p>

<p>"Eustace! Eustace!" he called, in his customary manner;
"what, my boy! do you shun me?"</p>

<p>"I only shun you, sir," I replied; "because I thought you
would have me do so."</p>

<p>"How dare you think so?" he said, half playfully, and half
angrily; "how dare you say so, rather, for I know you didn't
think so?"</p>

<p>"I hope, sir," I replied with a haughty air, that was not
wholly affected, "you do not think that I would say what I do
not believe."</p>

<p>"Ha! that's brave my boy!" he exclaimed, taking me by the
hand, and drawing me towards him, "Come. Now you look
as though you were worthy of being called Eustace St. Hugh.
That's the true spirit, my boy. If you are not the son of a
soldier, remember that you bear the name of one, and never
allow anybody to cast an imputation upon your sincerity."

<!-- Volume I, Page 91 -->

<p>Good Heavens! How the blood tingled in my temples as I
thought of the deceit I was practicing towards this good man.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my son," he said, laughing, "do not take it so
much to heart. Come, come, I beg your pardon; let us be
friends once more. Now I see that you will never disgrace
the name of St. Hugh. Sit by my side here and let us talk
together."</p>

<p>"But why, sir, do you bid me remember that old Sir Eustace
was a soldier?" I said, wishing to turn the tide of his thoughts;
"are there no honorable men but what are soldiers? Is the
business of throat-cutting, and town-destroying, and orphan-making,
and powder-burning, and sword-wearing, the only one
that admits of honorable feelings?"</p>

<p>My father started back in amazement as he heard me utter
these compound queries; and he well might, for I had learned
them but an hour before, of my Latin teacher, who put them to
me in reply to a foolish boast that I was the grandson of a soldier.

<p>"Ha, lad!" he said, "but this climate ripens men too early.
You are growing old too soon. I must take you home to Blackmere
castle to check your growth. The fogs and cold air, and a
little hard riding, will bring out your color, and give your mind
rest while your body is developing itself. That cut-water of
yours, my boy, would not look out of place among the portraits
in Blackmere Castle, but there should be a little more breadth of
beam to make your picture look as though it belonged there, the
St. Hughs were all square-shouldered and high-nosed, and there
never was a pale cheek in the family. This Yankee atmosphere
braces one up a little too sharp."</p>

<p>He had never before said anything about taking me to Blackmere
Castle, and I am sure my eyes must have sparkled with
pleasure to hear him talk of it, for, once away from New York,
I should lose all fear of ever being detected. But my gay feelings
were soon checked by what followed.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," he said, "I am getting tired of this country,
and I must go home again. But before I return, I must go with

<!-- Volume I, Page 92 -->

you to Boston, and find out some of your relations there. Would
you not be glad to see them again?"</p>

<p>He must have noticed my confusion, when I replied "Yes;"
but he probably attributed it to some other than the real cause;
so he continued:</p>

<p>"Ha! my boy! how little you dream of the cause of my visit
here. How little you suspect the origin of the love I feel for
you, and the strange sympathy which seems to bind us together.
But you will never know; you never can know. Because I
was down-cast, and sullen, and gloomy, yesterday, feeling weary
of the world and of myself, you thought, perhaps, that I had
taken a dislike to you. But you were mistaken, my boy; it
was not you to whom I had taken a dislike, but to myself. O,
God! O, God! forgive me, but I have cause!"</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hands for a few minutes, and
then lifting his head again, looked into my face with his accustomed
good nature, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! my little philosopher! I forgot; you were talking
about orphan-makers and honor. Faith, Eustace, but those
were home questions, and I must confess to you that I have
queried in that way to myself before now. It is not, my boy,
that the mere throat-cutting, town-destroying, powder-burning
and widow-making part of a soldier's duty is more honorable than
any other kind of hard labor, by which men earn their fortunes,
but the life of a soldier is more honorable than that of a mercenary
trader, because he risks more, endures more, and receives
less; and he does this not for himself alone, but for all the rest of
his countrymen. To be sure, he may fight in a bad cause, and
his labors may produce more harm than good, but still his motives
are not mercenary, and as he professes to be guided by
a spirit of honor, all his actions must square with his professions.
Therefore, he is bound to resent an imputation upon his honor,
because a soldier who would be so base as to violate his word,
may well be distrusted in the other essentials of the character of
a brave man.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 93 -->

<p>"So, Eustace, my boy, keep a sharp look out while you are
young, and be careful that you do nothing to make you ashamed
when you grow old. Ah, lad! had I done so myself, I would
not now be sitting here with you!" He sighed deeply, and
resting his head upon his hand, sat in silence until it grew quite
dark, when we returned to the house together.</p>

<p>Nearly two years passed away in this secluded retreat, and
during the whole time I never once went into the city; my
father went in but seldom, yet he received the morning papers
daily, and often had letters, the contents of which he never alluded
to, and I never troubled myself to think about his business.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was late in the autumn, the nights had grown longer and
cooler, and instead of sitting out upon the piazza during the
evening to escape the mosquitoes which the light drew into the
room, we had removed in doors, and could spend an hour or two
after supper, comfortably by lamp light. One evening, as I sat
studying my lesson, my father threw down the newspaper he had
been nodding over, and exclaimed, "For England, ho!" I
looked up and laughed, and he said:</p>

<p>"Now, lad, it is time to go home. We can spend a pleasanter
winter in old England than we can here in this rickety old lath-and-plaster
castle. Yes, lad, God willing, you shall eat your
Christmas dinner at Blackmere, and drink the king's health in
his own dominions." The thought of it seemed to exhilarate
him, and he leaped from his chair and danced around the room in
great glee. "Yes, my brave Eustace, and you shall go to
Oxford and finish your education."</p>

<p>I could have danced with delight, too, for I longed to see
Blackmere, and stroll through the great hall where the portrait
of old Sir Eustace and the rest of the St. Hughs were hanging in

<!-- Volume I, Page 94 -->

grand state. And, then, I was more than all desirous to get clear
from New York, where I would be in continual danger of
encountering somebody who had known me as Tom Pepper,
although I had grown so tall, and was so much altered in my
appearance, that there was little danger of my being recognized.
However, I did not let my thoughts escape, but kept my eyes
fixed upon the book I was studying, although I could not read a
work of the lesson, because my mind was wandering elsewhere.
The next morning as he sat at breakfast, reading the paper of
the day before, as was his custom, I saw his face suddenly grow
pale, his hand trembled, his lips quivered, and his whole frame
seemed to be convulsed. I was frightened at the sudden change
in his appearance, and jumped towards him, fearing that he
would fall from his seat.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, lad," he said, "there's nothing the matter
with me. Sit, sit down, and drink your coffee."</p>

<p>"But, surely, you are sick," I said, "you look so pale, and
your hand trembles so. I am frightened. Let me call the
gardener."</p>

<p>"Yes, lad, call him," he replied, "for I must go to town. But
do not be frightened, I am not sick. It is something which I
have read here that has unnerved me. Go call Mackintosh,
(that was the gardener's name,) and tell him to saddle my horse,
for I must start at once."</p>

<p>I ran for the gardener, and when I returned my father was
already dressed, with his riding-whip in his hand, and prepared
to start. He paced the piazza impatiently until his horse was
brought, and then leaped into the saddle, and, without bidding me
good bye, or, indeed, speaking to me at all, or even looking
towards me, he put spurs to his horse and dashed out of the gate.
It was the first time that he had ever gone to town without bidding
me good bye, and telling me what to do in his absence, and
I was so much grieved at his strange coolness, that I felt my
eyes running over with tears. But now I was too old to indulge
in tears, and I tried to gulp down the choking sensation in my

<!-- Volume I, Page 95 -->

throat, by persuading myself that I had been insulted by his
coldness. In a short time my teacher came to hear me recite
my lessons, and with the carelessness of my disposition, I forgot
my griefs and went about my usual occupations as light-hearted
and happy as ever. In the afternoon, I took advantage of my
father's absence to treat myself to a ride on my pony, and
having come across a party of cricketers during my ride, playing
in a field, I stopped a long while to see them play, so that before
I returned home it was quite dark. These was a light in the
dining-room, by which I knew that my father had returned, and
there was a horse and gig standing at the door, by which I knew
that there must be company with him. This latter circumstance
surprised me, because it was so unusual, and I looked around
for Mackintosh to enquire who the stranger was, but I could not
find him, so I jumped off my pony, and tying him to the fence,
stepped softly upon the piazza to look into the window and see
who it was that my father had with him. It was a gentleman;
he sat with his back towards me, at the centre-table, and my
father was showing him some papers. They were conversing
with great earnestness, but as I could not approach close to the
window without being discovered, I was unable to distinguish
what they said. The stranger held something in his hand, that
he was examining closely, and I presently perceived that it was
the miniature of old Sir Eustace. He looked at it long and
steadily, and then my father seemed to be explaining something
to him about it, as though he were pointing out each separate
feature to him as he had often done to me. I was just on the
point of leaving the piazza, when I fancied that I beheld my father
say "Tom Pepper." I was not sure, and, indeed, it was impossible
that he should have said it, but I was so strongly impressed
with the thought that he had, that I stole still closer to the
window, and heard him distinctly say, "The young rogue!"
and I felt certain that I was the subject of their conversation.
My blood was on fire in a moment, and I was all impatience
to discover who it could be that my father was talking to. But

<!-- Volume I, Page 96 -->

he wouldn't move. There he sat glued to the chair, and nothing
could induce him to turn his head. By and by my father
walked across the room, for he seemed impatient and uneasy;
then he came to the window and listened as though he was
watching for my return.</p>

<p>I stood in the shadow of one of the pillars so that he could not
see me, and as he turned from the window to walk back to the
table, I heard him say, "The rogue stays late!" The stranger
looked round as my father spoke, and instantly I recognized the
countenance of Mr. Bassett. The sight of his face gave such
a shock to my heart, that I came near falling from the effect of
the fright. Now he stood up, and as the light fell full upon his
face, I saw that it was, indeed, my old benefactor, whom I had
believed was in his grave so long. He did not seem changed in
the least since I had seen him last; he wore his cravat in the
same peculiar manner, his features wore the same mild, benevolent
expression, and even his clothes appeared to have suffered
no change. It occurred to me at once that I had been deceived
in regard to his death, and turned from the book-keeper's house
by the instrumentality of his wife. But what could have
brought him here? Nothing, but to discover me. By some
means or other he had heard of me, and had informed my father
of my real name. I could now understand the cause of his
coldness to me in the morning, and of his singular conduct.
Alas! alas! My good fortune was at an end. All my falsehoods
must now be exposed, and I should be spurned by my best,
my only friends, who had endeavored to instill into my mind
principles of honor and a love of truth; and I had basely,
wickedly, foolishly, deceived them. How could I meet them and
endure this reproach? I had not the courage to endure it. I
should be stripped of all my honors, I felt certain, be forced to
abandon the name of the St. Hughs, and perhaps turned off with
indignity and reproaches. I stepped off the piazza to reflect for
a moment what I should do, and my mind was instantly made up.
There was no other course but flight; to face these excellent and

<!-- Volume I, Page 97 -->

most honorable men to whom I owed so much, and whose kindness
I had so basely betrayed, was impossible. So, casting another
look towards the window, the light from which seemed to shine
out as if from a heaven that was closed upon me, I unfastened
my pony, and leading him out quietly into the road, jumped
upon his back and began to gallop towards the city. The night
had grown very dark, not a star twinkled in the sky, and a low,
moaning wind swept through the trees. A thousand voices
seemed to be calling after me as I dashed on, "Tom Pepper!
Tom Pepper! Stop him! Stop him!" My heart throbbed
violently, my head pained me, my throat was hot and husky, and I
felt wild and delirious. The echoes of my horse's hoofs sounded
like somebody pursuing me, and every carriage that I passed
seemed to contain somebody that knew me, and pointed at me
saying, "There goes the cowardly runaway, who deceived his
best friends!" It grew darker and darker as I approached the
city, but still I thought that everybody was looking at me as I
galloped along the road, and when I entered upon the lamp
district, where the fungous-looking lights threw a faint glimmer
across the road, I thought that I was watched by every horseman
and foot passenger that passed me. But on I galloped, until my
poor pony was covered with foam, and it was not until I found
myself in a crowded street, filled with shops and brilliant with
gas lights, that I slackened his speed, and began to think what
would become of me. I was half inclined, at one moment, to
turn round, go back, and ask pardon of my two fathers. I had
been guilty of deceiving them, and knowing their sternness and
their integrity, I had no hope for forgiveness; or, if they should
forgive me, I could not endure their commiseration. Now I
began to see how unnecessarily wicked I had become, and the
truth of what Mr. Bassett had so often told me, that no departure
from the truth, let the motive be what it might that instigated it,
ever failed to bring its evil consequences. But my thoughts
were immediately drawn from myself to my poor pony. I
could not spend the night on his back, and I knew not where to

<!-- Volume I, Page 98 -->

find him refreshment, which the poor beast greatly needed.
Poor pony! He was dreadfully tired and weary, as well as
myself. I got off his back, and patting him on the neck, told
him how sorry I felt for him, and how sad I felt myself. He
rubbed his head against me, and seemed to say that he wanted
hay more than sympathy. So, throwing his bridle across my
arm, I led him along the street until I found a livery-stable,
where I entrusted him to the hostler, who promised me that he
would feed him well, and give him some clean straw to lie upon.
I hope he kept his promise, for pony had been my only play-fellow
for almost two years, and I loved him as well as a brother.
Poor pony! he rested better that night than I did, I dare say,
for he had done no wrong, and had not to suffer the galling
reflection that he had brought harm upon himself by his own
follies. Having found good quarters for the companion of my
flight, my next thought was to provide quarters for myself, and as
I knew that there would be no difficulty in purchasing good treatment
while I had money to pay for it, I felt under no great
apprehensions, and so proceeded leisurely to look for some hotel,
where I should not be likely to encounter any one who knew me.
It was so long since I had been in the city that I was somewhat
confused by the crowds in Broadway, and I suppose that I
betrayed my country living by my manner, for I had not walked
far when I was accosted by two handsomely-dressed young
ladies, who talked in a very sprightly and friendly manner,
which immediately made a favorable impression upon me.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Bub?" said one of them, who wore a
green satin dress and a scarlet shawl.</p>

<p>I told her that I was going in search of a hotel, and said I
would be obliged to her if she could direct me to a good one.</p>

<p>"Go home with me, Bub," said the lady with the green dress.
But before I had time to answer, the other one caught hold of
my arm, and declared that I should go home with her. This
lead to an altercation between these ladies, in which they
indulged in coarser language than I had ever before heard from

<!-- Volume I, Page 99 -->

one of the sex. Each accused the other of being "no lady,"
and I found that they were proceeding to dangerous extremities, so
I told them that I would put an end to their quarrel, by refusing
to go with either. But this only made them more abusive than
before, and the scarlet shawl taking me by the arm, fairly compelled
me to go with her; the other lady vented her anger in
rather a loud and bold manner, and then left us. As I was
determined not to practice any more deception where there
should be no particular necessity, I frankly told this generous
lady that I was a stranger, without a home, without friends, and
with but little money, and that she would be doing a charitable
deed by giving me a supper and a bed. All this she very
kindly promised to do, and when we got to her house, which was
a very nice looking one, she took me into a small parlor, which
was rather shabbily furnished, although there were a great
many articles of finery, and asked me what I would have for
supper. I told her that I was by no means particular in my
appetite, but that if it was perfectly convenient, I could manage
to dispose of a cold chicken, some stewed oysters, with bread and
butter, and a glass or two of pale sherry, and a cup of coffee.
She had the ill-manners to laugh at my simple request, and said
she guessed I would have to be satisfied with some soft-crabs and
a bottle of root beer, and after being absent a few minutes, she
returned with these homely delicacies on a little japanned waiter.
I was so exceedingly hungry, that I dispatched the crabs in a
very short time, and drank part of the beer, which was by no
means palatable. I had grown quite dainty in my tastes, for
my father was extremely partial to a good dinner, and he had
accustomed me to eating a variety of made dishes, as well as
drinking two or three glasses of sherry every day. It was his
custom always at dinner to drink the health of the King, which
I did to gratify him, although it always brought my grandfather
Pepper to mind, and the stories which he uses to relate about
flogging the British, and as I drank off the root beer, I could not
help thinking that my father St. Hugh was just then, probably,

<!-- Volume I, Page 100 -->

drinking the King's health in a glass of delicious sherry. I
thought it would be uncivil to ask the lady for more, although
my hunger was not half appeased; indeed, it was rather whetted
sharper by the crabs. But I made no complaints, only I determined
to make amends the next morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty fellow, Bub" said the young lady; "won't
you give me a lock of your hair before you leave me?"</p>

<p>This rather flattered my pride, and I replied that I would not
give her a lock of my hair, but I would exchange with her for
one of her silken locks.</p>

<p>"What else will you give me, Bub?" she said.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the freedom of her manner, and not wishing
to be outdone by her in politeness, I replied that I would give
her a kiss. This was rather bold, but it did not offend her, and
she said, "How much money have you got, Bub?"</p>

<p>I took out my pocket book, and showed her that I had but four
or five dollars.</p>

<p>"And what is that hanging to that ribbon?" she said.</p>

<p>I was proud to show her the portrait of old Sir Eustace, which
she took from my neck and hung round her own.

<p>"And what a sweet ring that is," she said; "let me try it on to
my wedding finger."</p>

<p>So she took off my turquoise ring that my father had given
me, and put it upon her own finger.</p>

<p>"Where is your watch?" she said; "hasn't my little beauty
got a gold watch?"</p>

<p>I told her that I had left my watch at home, which was the
truth, and very sorry I was, too, that I had.</p>

<p>I thought it very strange that she did not ask me my name,
but considered it a proof of her delicacy. And, I was very glad
that she did not, for I should have been exceedingly embarrassed
if she had, as I had not yet christened myself with a new one,
and had not made up my mind whose to take. As to the lady's
name, I was rather curious to know what it was, but concluded
to wait until morning before I asked her. I felt myself every

<!-- Volume I, Page 101 -->

moment growing so sleepy that I could scarcely keep my eyes
open, and had to turn my head two or three times lest she should
see me yawn. At last I had to confess to the lady that, in spite
of her sprightly conversation, I could not keep myself awake, and
that I would be obliged to her if she would allow me to retire to
my room.</p>

<p>"Well, Bub, if you are sleepy, I will put you to bed," she
replied, and I followed her into the next apartment, where she
said I could lie down. But as she offered, with more good
nature than delicacy, to remain in the room while I undressed
myself, I positively refused to go to bed unless she withdrew;
which she did after a while, and then I took off my clothes, and
having placed them carefully within reach, I jumped into bed
and was asleep in a moment. I was not, naturally, of a sleepy
turn, but after drinking the root beer I felt uncommonly drowsy,
which I attributed to the nature of that beverage.</p>

<p>If I was troubled with any dreams that night, I have forgotten
them now, but what happened on my waking next morning, may
appear like a dream to some of those unimaginative people who
will probably read my autobiography.</p>

<p>Even the greatest heroes, whose deeds have been chronicled
by the pen of history, have been censured by students
in their closets; and I have known jobbers and lawyers
to say what they would have done had they been placed in
Napoleon's shoes at the battle of Waterloo; and militia colonels
have demonstrated to their own satisfaction, that the Emperor
might have gained the day had he done thus and so, which they
would have done had they been placed in the same circumstances.
This is one of the disadvantages of having your life
read by the public. There will always be some priggish reader
to measure his understanding by yours, and condemn you for
doing as he would not have done. This is as unwise as it is
ungenerous; for, by continually quarrelling with the hero whose
exploits you are reading, you deprive yourself of the pleasure
which may be derived from identifying yourself with his

<!-- Volume I, Page 102 -->

fortunes, and making his affairs your own. It is ungenerous to
condemn the acts of another, who has been moved by the sole
desire to promote his own pleasures, and has consequently done
the best he could to gain that object.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that some persons, if placed in the condition
in which I found myself on awaking that morning, would
have acted very differently from what I did, and if I could have
had their advice, it is not unlikely that I might have followed
it. But I was alone, without much experience in the crooked
ways of the world, and placed in circumstances which I had
never heard of anybody being placed in before, since the transgression
of our first parents. I was, in fact, stark naked. On rising
from my bed I could not find my clothes, and on reflecting upon
the transactions of the past night, no doubt remained in my
mind that I had been entrapped by one of those wicked Syrens
that infest large cities, but of whose actual existence I had never
dreamed, and that I had been robbed of everything I possessed in
the world. The thought of remaining in such a den terrified
me exceedingly, but the impossibility of making my escape
frightened me still more. I pounded upon the floor, but nobody
came near me; I shouted with all my might for my clothes, but
nobody heeded me. The window of the room in which I had
slept looked upon a little court yard, surrounded by mean
wooden buildings, and the only living thing that I could see, was
a Maltese cat, sitting with most provoking composure in the open
window of the opposite house. I thought that people who were
wicked enough to rob me in that scandalous manner, might be
wicked enough to murder me, and I was determined to make my
escape as speedily as possible, even though I should be compelled
to leave the house in that state in which Adam left Paradise.
But there happened to be a closet in the chamber, and opening
the door in hopes of finding my clothes, in which I was disappointed,
I found there the dress of the woman who had enticed
me into her den. There was no other alternative for me, but to
habit myself in petticoats, and I found that the clothes exactly

<!-- Volume I, Page 103 -->

fitted me. As there was a complete wardrobe of female
garments, I attired myself with an entire suit, and when I looked
at myself in the glass I hardly recognized myself, I was so completely
transformed by my feminine garments. The gown
which I put on was rather gay, being a light green silk,
with a flounce, and the shawl, a bright red Canton crape,
embroidered with white flowers, was rather more showy than I
liked; but there was no other, and I was forced to take it. The
bonnet, too, was exceedingly gay, being a light straw, trimmed
with pink ribbons, and having large bunches of artificial roses on
the inside. I should have been troubled for shoes, for I found
that the lady's were much too small for me, but by good luck
my own had not been taken; probably they were not considered
of sufficient value. As my beard had not yet made its appearance,
and my hair was long and curly, it is but simple justice to
myself to say, that there have been worse looking faces under a
bonnet than mine. There was a pot of rouge on the dressing-table,
but I had no occasion to use it, for my cheeks had a good
deal of color, which was now considerably heightened, partly by
shame, and partly by the uncomfortable tightness of my dress.
I ransacked the closet in hopes of finding some article of jewelry
to recompense me for my ring, money, and the portrait of old
Sir Eustace, the loss of which grieved me more than all the rest.</p>

<p>Having finished my toilet and surveyed myself in the glass,
pretty closely, to make sure that I had omitted nothing essential
to render me <i>comme il faut</i> in my new character, I opened
the chamber door softly and stepped quietly down the stairs
into the hall; but here I had to encounter a new difficulty; the
street door was locked and bolted, and the key was removed.
This alarmed me still more, for it appeared as though there was
a plan to prevent my escape. I could hear no one stirring in
the house, and thought that if I could get one of the inmates to
open the door, I could contrive to make my escape even though
I should be opposed. So I pulled the wire of the street door bell,
until I made such a noise that I brought, the keeper of the house

<!-- Volume I, Page 104 -->

down. I heard her coming down the stairs, muttering and
shaking a bunch of keys, so I retired to the back part of the
hall, where I waited until she opened the door to see who had
been ringing the bell, when I ran towards the door, but she perceived
me, and closed it again, and stood with her back
towards it.</p>

<p>She was a stout, red-faced woman, with a gruff voice, and a
muscular-looking arm.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of all this madam," she said, "are you
going to run off without paying for your night's lodging? Come,
come, just hand over your money, or I'll have that shawl off your
shoulders."</p>

<p>"Let me go out," I said, "I owe you nothing."</p>

<p>"Let you go out, indeed!" screamed the wretch, "let you go
out. You shall not go out of this house. This is very pretty to
have a strange lady sleep in my house, and after turning me out
of bed at this hour, to walk off without paying for her lodging.
No, no, madam. You shall not leave this house in my debt."</p>

<p>I saw now that I should be detected, if I did not make my
escape at once; for the old woman began to talk very loud, and
scream, and she would doubtless soon have somebody to aid her.
So I determined upon a bold push, and stepping up to her, I said
"Will you not allow me to go out?" and, at the same moment
I seized her by the throat, and attempted to thrust her aside,
but she proved harder to manage than I had anticipated, and I
was so much cramped by my clothes that l could not move myself
with freedom. After struggling with her ineffectually some
time, I disengaged myself from her, and struck her a blow with
my fist which sent her reeling against the wall; whereupon she
set up a cry of murder, and I succeeded in opening the door and
getting into the street.  Without stopping to look behind me, or
see whither I was going, I ran as fast as my strange garments
would allow me, and soon reached Broadway, where I felt myself
secure from further molestation. It was still early in the
day, and the tide of life set down towards Wall street; the shop-keepers

<!-- Volume I, Page 105 -->

were taking down their shutters&mdash;the omnibusses were
creeping slowly down with hardly a passenger&mdash;the milk-men
were crying out their dismal notes; and the only females seen in
the street were plainly-clad work-women proceeding to their daily
labor; some to hatter-shops, some to milliner's, some to color
maps, and some to the manufacture of band-boxes and artificial-flowers.</p>

<p>I looked at these poor women with a good deal of interest, and
wondered whether or not I should be able to find any employment
in my new character, by which I could earn my daily
bread. Whether it was owing to my gay dress, or my ungainly
walk, I do not know, but I was a good deal annoyed to notice
that everybody who passed me turned round to look at me; but
with a proper sense of what was required in the character of a
lady, I hung down my head, feeling more ashamed, I dare say,
than the most timid young girl could have felt, and walked
quietly on, without turning round, or daring to look anybody in
the face. In my anxiety to escape from the dreadful den
into which I had been entrapped, I had never once thought of the
consequences of putting on female apparel, or reflected that I
had no money to procure me a home. But a little reflection
convinced me of the distressingly awkward position in which I
was placed. I could do nothing as a woman, and was still less
capable of doing anything as a man in my present dress. I was
completely bewildered in my embarrassment, and knew not
what to do. But I could not stand still in the street without
attracting a mob, so I walked on, quite uncertain when I should
stop. If it had been night, I could have contrived some means
of procuring a shelter, but early in the morning, with the whole
day before me, and not a penny in my purse, the prospect was
dreadful. My troubles were thickening every moment, and my
appetite growing sharper and sharper. I half resolved to seek
for Mr. Bassett, and throw myself upon his generosity, but I
could not endure the thought of the mild reproaches of that most
excellent man, for my shameful disregard of his precepts, and

<!-- Volume I, Page 106 -->

the wicked deceits I had practiced upon the noble hearted and
generous Captain St. Hugh. What a fool I had been to deprive
myself of the protection of such a man! and to cheat myself out
of a visit to Blackmere Castle, and all the privileges of the home
of the St. Hughs. And this was the effect of not speaking the
truth! I had persuaded myself that it was right to do wrong
from a good motive, and this was the result! If I had not been
so hungry I would have sat down and wept for vexation. But I
had no time for grief. Tears will not flow readily from an
empty stomach. Hungry men are generally terribly in earnest,
and I could think of nothing seriously but breakfast. I remembered
that I had seen men eating their breakfasts at the open
stands round the markets, but I had never seen any women there.
But I knew of no other place where there was a probability of
finding anything to eat, and I bent my steps towards the Bear
Market, on the North River, where I had once before refreshed
myself with dough-nuts and coffee.</p>

<p>Here I found a scene of the most charming description for a
hungry youth; the air was loaded with the perfume of fried
sausages, and broiling steaks. Hot coffee steamed up from
scores of tables, at which cartmen sat in their snowy white
frocks, regaling themselves with luxurious breakfasts in the open
air; news-boys were seated on benches screened by a piece of
tattered canvas, while some red-faced Irish women served up
for them buttered crumpets and coffee. Negroes were there,
too, in great numbers, joking and laughing, and as happy as
lords over their fried liver and onions. There were fat market-women
breakfasting on beef steaks, which they ate holding their
plates in their lap; but I saw no lady with a green silk dress
and a crimson shawl among all the groups of lively feeders.</p>

<p>The scene was a very pleasant one, and under different
circumstances I should have enjoyed it greatly, but in my
present condition it was sad enough for me; I saw no prospects
of a breakfast, and as I wandered around among the stalls, I was
completely at a loss in what manner to contrive to get something

<!-- Volume I, Page 107 -->

to eat.  If my dress had not been so glaringly fine, I could have
stepped into one of the eating-houses and offered my services as
a servant; but habited in a green silk gown, a crimson shawl
and a pink bonnet, I should only have excited suspicion, and,
perhaps, have been sent to prison. Almost every butcher made
me a mock bow, and winking to his neighbor, would say, "Any
beef this morning, madam?" while some of the women who sold
fruit and vegetables, favored me with rather broad compliments
upon the extravagantly gay manner in which I was dressed; but
one sturdy fellow, in a white frock and a pair of checked sleeves,
swore that I was the ladiest woman he had seen in market in
many a day. I gave some of these rude people terribly hard
looks, and was sorely tempted to give them a blow with my fist,
but that, I thought, would so ill accord with my character, that
it might lead to my detection. While I stood debating in my
mind what course to pursue, I saw Mr. Bassett enter the market
with a basket in his hand. I could scarce refrain from running
to him and acknowledging myself. But I had been guilty of
such monstrous deceits, and even then was acting such a prodigious
lie, that I was afraid to meet his reproofs, which I was
conscious of richly deserving; I passed him two or three times
while he stood at the stall bargaining for some meat, with the
hope that he might recognize me; but he took no notice of me,
and when he went out I felt more desperate than ever. What a
provoking place a market is for a man who wants a breakfast,
but who is without the means to pay for one. As I stood looking
wistfully at a round of beef in the stall at which Mr. Bassett
had made his purchase, the butcher, who was an old man, said
to me:</p>

<p>"Young woman, do you want some beef this morning?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "but I want some money to pay for my
breakfast."</p>

<p>"O, ho!" said he, "that's it, is it? Take this and tell me
your number;" so saying, he put half a dollar into my hand.</p>

<p>"Friend, art thou not ashamed of thyself!" exclaimed somebody,

<!-- Volume I, Page 108 -->

and turning round I saw a Quaker gentleman, with a
basket in his hand, who had been standing near and had heard
the conversation between the butcher and myself. He was an
elderly gentleman, dressed in a suit of drab clothes, after the
Quaker fashion, with knee breeches and white stockings; he
was short, but stout, and he had a very benevolent countenance,
which did not look the worse for being set off with a white muslin
cravat.</p>

<p>"What is thy name?" he said to me.</p>

<p>I blushed at the question, for I had not yet thought of a name;
but I replied, after a moment's hesitation, "Sarah."</p>

<p>"Well, Sarah," said the Quaker, "has thee got no home, that
thee comes to the market for thy breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "I had a home once, but I have none now."</p>

<p>"Well, I see by thy blushing thou art not wholly lost.
Return the money which the man gave thee, and come with me."</p>

<p>"Look at that old sinner!" said the butcher, as I followed the
Quaker.</p>

<p>"Friend," said he, stopping and addressing the butcher,
"thou art welcome to thy jeers. I know thee well, as thou
knowest me. I have rescued this young woman from thy
libidinous hands, and thou may say what thou pleases."</p>

<p>The butcher said something in reply, about a canting hypocrite,
but the Quaker travelled on without stopping to listen, and
I followed him.</p>

<p>"Young woman," he add, when we had got clear from the
market, "I perceive from thy dress what thou art, but I pity
thee and as thou art young yet, thou may return to thy friends,
and become an honest woman once more."</p>

<p>I felt so indignant at the Quaker's suspicions, that I had a good
mind to tell him was not half so penetrating as he thought
he was, and that my dress, instead of being an index to my
character, had entirely misled him. But I was so impatient for my
breakfast, that I didn't care to destroy my chance of getting it,
by a too hasty exposure of myself. As the old gentleman's

<!-- Volume I, Page 109 -->

basket was heavy, I said, "Will you allow me to assist you with
your marketing?"</p>

<p>"No Sarah," he said, "I am used to carrying a basket, and
thou hast a sufficiently heavy load to carry already. One that
thou canst not put down as easily as I can this when I reach my
home."</p>

<p>I assured him that so far from having a load to carry, that I
was so unfortunate as to have nothing in the world but the
clothes I wore.</p>

<p>"I perceive, Sarah," he said, "that thou art yet young in
wickedness. The load I spoke of was one that weighs upon the
conscience. If thou does not feel any, it is only worse for thee."</p>

<p>I told him that my conscience was quite free from loads of
any kind.</p>

<p>"Well, Sarah, thy feelings are to come by and by," he said;
"but can it be possible that thou feels nothing now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied, "but a most terrible gnawing in my
stomach, for I am very hungry."</p>

<p>"If that is all, Sarah, thou shalt be satisfied," said he; "my
wife, and my daughter, Desire, will give thee a hearty breakfast.
Thou hast escaped, a great mercy, this morning, and hath cause
to be grateful; the man that offered thee money, is a wicked
person, and thou must not go to that place any more. I will see
that thou art provided with the means of earning an honest
living. Can thou sew, Sarah?"</p>

<p>I told him that I feared I should make but an indifferent
hand with a needle and thread.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, thou art good at housework, and can handle a
broom with dexterity, or do the work of a chamber-maid?" he
said.</p>

<p>But I had to acknowledge that I was no more of an adept at
such business than with a needle.</p>

<p>"What, then, can you do?" said the Quaker.</p>

<p>"Nothing, but ride, and drive, and swim, and fish, and study,"
I replied.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 110 -->

<p>"So, I see the cause of thy misfortune, Sarah; thou had a
foolish mother, who brought thee up in idleness, and now thou
must resort to crime for thy support. Well, I will give thee in
charge to my daughter, Desire, and she will instruct thee in
some useful employment; but thou must never leave the house
alone. If thou art expert at learning, thou wilt soon be able to
earn thy living. Thou must take off all those wicked red and
green dresses, and put on the becoming garments of Friends.
Then thou wilt not have to run into the streets to show thyself;
and thou wilt be in no danger from wicked men."</p>

<p>In conversation somewhat like this, we engaged until we
reached the house of the benevolent Quaker, which was in East
Broadway. It was a comfortable-looking house, excepting that
it was uncomfortably clean and tidy, and that everything about
it was drab color. We entered at the basement door, and I saw
through the windows that the breakfast table was spread, which
was a very pleasant sight to me. A sedate, but fat old lady met
us in the entry, dressed with extreme plainness, and looking
comfortable and contented.</p>

<p>"This is my wife, Rachel Goodwill," said the old gentleman,
"and this young woman, Rachel, is one of the unfortunate kind,
that we must take care of. Her name is Sarah; what is thy
other name?"</p>

<p>"Martin," I replied, happening, just then to be thinking of a
female of that name, whose other name was Betsey.</p>

<p>"This is Sarah Martin," said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Thee is welcome, Sarah; come in and take off thy bonnet,"
said Mrs. Goodwill, and I followed her into the breakfast parlor,
and sat down upon the sofa. Presently there came in a young
lady of such surpassing sweetness of countenance, and so graceful
and quiet in her carriage, that I was quite enraptured with
her at the first glance.</p>

<p>"This is my daughter, Desire Goodwill," said the old gentleman,
who, having given the basket in charge of his wife, had
taken off his hat and smoothed down his hair over his forehead; for

<!-- Volume I, Page 111 -->

although he had one of those high, broad foreheads, which any
man might be proud of, he took no pains to display it to advantage,
but combed his hair over it with as much indifference as
though it had been a wig on a barber's block. In another
moment, a fresh, hearty-looking young man entered, and the old
man said, "This is my son, Wilson Goodwill." I bowed to him
instead of curtseying, as I should have done, and he reached
out his hand and said, "How does thee do? I am glad to see
thee." Directly afterwards breakfast was placed upon the
table, and I was asked, unexpectedly, to sit down with them.</p>

<p>The breakfast was admirable, and the neatness of the table
appointments quite delighted me. After we had taken our seats,
they all sat in motionless silence for the space of one or two
minutes, which seemed dreadfully tedious to me, I was so impatient
to begin, and then, at a sign from the old gentleman, they all
began to unfold their napkins, and then proceeded very deliberately
to the grand business of dispatching the breakfast. I
observed that the young man eyed me rather closely, but the
young lady seemed to avert her bright hazel eyes from me on
purpose.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the kindness of these good people; it
was so quiet, so hearty, and so free from ceremony, that I was
quite enchanted; and, then, the breakfast was so good, and my
appetite so keen, that I really thought I had never before known
what it was to sit down at a well furnished table. Not many
words were spoken, but they were all soft, gentle and persuasive.
Rachel Goodwill's words flowed as smoothly from her lips, as
the rich cream which she poured from a silver cup into my
coffee, and the looks of Desire were as sweet as the new honey
which she helped me to from a china dish, of snowy purity; as
for the old gentleman, he was not one of those persons of whom
it is said that butter will not melt in their mouths, for the mild
warmth of his manner would have melted a rock. He was continually
jogging Wilson to re-fill my plate with a very delicate
species of food, which I tasted then for the first time, called

<!-- Volume I, Page 112 -->

flannel cakes; and that plump-cheeked, bright-eyed young
Friend seemed to take peculiar pleasure in responding to his
father's hints, looking slily into my face and saying:</p>

<p>"Sarah, wilt thou take some more of the flannels?" And
once he said, as if by mistake, "Shall I change thy flannel&mdash;&mdash;I
mean thy plate, Sarah?" And, at the same time, the wicked
rogue trod so hard upon my toes, as to cause me to start
involuntarily. But he looked so demurely that neither his father
or mother seemed to suspect anything wrong. After breakfast,
this good old gentleman and his son Wilson, left the house to
go down town to their business, which was that of commission
merchants, they were agents of some calico manufacturers in
Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>And now I had to undergo a harder trial, and tax my inventive
powers more severely than I had ever done before; for Rachel
Goodwill sent for one of her neighbors, noted for her literary
abilities as well as her benevolence, and taking me into a private
apartment, they advised me to confess to them the whole of my
past career, and reveal the name of my undoer. This was
something for which I was wholly unprepared, but my blushing
and stammering rather helped to deceive these excellent ladies,
and greatly increased their pity for me, by convincing them that
I was not wholly and irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>"You need not hesitate to tell the name of your lover," said
the friend of Mrs. Goodwill, "nor to confess to what extent you
have sinned, for it is not our mission to condemn, but to pity and
reclaim the erring. It is because that you have loved and erred
that we love you, and would do you good. Come, Sarah, raise
up your head, poor child, and tell us your griefs. It is no sin to
have loved too well.  Our sex have suffered too deeply from
men, not to make us compassionate those who fall from listening
to their wiles."</p>

<p>I could scarcely refrain from laughing to hear myself
addressed in this manner, and was forced to cover my face with
my pocket handkerchief two or thee times, to conceal my

<!-- Volume I, Page 113 -->

emotions, which they mistook for shame and grief, and only
renewed their tender entreaties for me to unburden myself. But
I was in doubt as to the best method to pursue, for I found that I
should engage their sympathies exactly in proportion to the
enormity of my transgressions; but I was unwilling to assume
the character of a Magdalen, lest they should think me an unfit
inmate of their families, and send me off to some house of reform,
where I should not be able to escape detection.</p>

<p>"Thee needn't be ashamed, Sarah," said good Mrs. Goodwill,
"our friend here, Sophia Ruby, knows how to pity such as
thee."</p>

<p>So, at last, I told them I was as innocent as an angel; that
my only fault was having left the kindest of fathers, a clergyman
in the country, at the request of a young gentleman who
had fallen in love with me, and who had promised to marry me,
but that on bringing me to the city, has first tried to accomplish
his base purposes, and then left me penniless; and that I was
ashamed to return to my father's house.</p>

<p>The ladies were filled with indignation on hearing my story,
and begged to be told the name of the villain who had seduced
me from my home. I resisted their entreaties for a long while,
and at last confessed that it was Mr. Ferocious.</p>

<p>"Ferocious!" exclaimed Mrs. Ruby, "surely, it cannot be
Jasper Ferocious, the author of Christopher Cockroach?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, for I thought that this would be a favorable
opportunity to repay that remarkable man for his rudeness to me.</p>

<p>"What a monstrous villain!" exclaimed Mrs. Ruby: "I
always thought there was some hidden iniquity in the conduct of
that wretch. But I have a scheme for punishing him, which I
will reveal hereafter. And now, good bye to you, Sarah;
remain here quietly with friend Goodwill, and you shall be well
cared for."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruby then pressed my hands warmly between her own,
and kissed my cheek, and left us. Friend Goodwill now called
in her daughter, Desire, who had probably been listening at the

<!-- Volume I, Page 114 -->

key-hole of the door, to consult with her about procuring me a
more becoming suit of clothes than those I had on, for they were
greatly scandalized at the excessive gaiety of my apparel.
Desire suggested that probably some of her own dresses would fit
me, and proposed that I should accompany her to her room and
try on some of her brown Cashmere gowns.</p>

<p>"No, Desire," said her mother, "Sarah is larger than thee;
thy dresses will not fit her."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," insisted Desire, "I know they will; at least
let her come and try them on." And she took my hand and tried
gently to compel me to follow her.</p>

<p>"Come, Sarah," she said, "I am sure I can fit thee exactly;
come with me to my room, while my mother is preparing the
dinner."</p>

<p>But I would not go with Desire, and begged that they would
allow me the liberty of lying upon the sofa until dinner, as I
was weary and sleepy. But still Desire insisted that I should lie
upon her bed, and still I insisted that I would not, and at last her
mother told her it was rude and wicked to wish to force me
against my will; so they left me at last, and I was rejoiced to be
once more alone.</p>

<p>Dear Desire! what a precious girl she was! So loving! so
good, and so innocent! I had never before seen such a perfect
assemblage of all the elements of beauty, as were met in her.
It was not hyperbolical to call her teeth pearls, for I am sure
that I never saw any pearls that were worthy of being compared
with them; and as for her lips and cheeks, I would like to see
the cherries and roses that would not lose their beauty by being
placed by the side of them; and so would the horticultural
society, I dare say. Her eyes were incomparable; there was
nothing in nature to which they could be likened; they were a
dark hazel, bright and dazzling, yet soft and full of tenderness;
she had a profusion of rich, brown hair, which was braided
plainly, as if to hide its luxuriousness. Her form was perfect
and most delicately rounded, and her darling little hand, which I

<!-- Volume I, Page 115 -->

could hardly keep from kissing when she took hold of mine, was
the plumpest, sweetest, and most bewitching hand in the whole
world. At least I thought so then, and think so now. She was
dressed with the most charming simplicity, and her clothes had a
becoming grace, as though they had been arranged by the hand
of a Phidias. My gaudy apparel looked strangely in the
drab-colored parlor of friend Goodwill, and I was rather anxious
to cast it off, but still more anxious to assume my proper
clothing.</p>

<p>The morning paper was lying on the centre-table, and I took
it up and was glancing my eye carelessly over it, when I
encountered this advertisement, the reading of which quite
prostrated me.</p>

<p>"<i>Information wanted, of a young man, who has called himself
at different times, Tom Pepper, Bedford Horton, and Eustace St.
Hugh. He is supposed to be about seventeen years of age, has a
fair complexion, light hair, and grey eyes. A handsome reward
will be paid to any one who will give any accurate information
respecting him, or his family, or respecting his present place of
residence.  Application to be made to Jasper Ferocious, Pine
street.</i>"</p>

<p>There could no longer be any doubt that Mr. Bassett and
Captain St. Hugh were determined to ferret me out, and expose
my deceptions, and they had employed my old enemy, Mr.
Ferocious, to aid them. But I was most fortunately placed in a
situation to defy them. Instead of looking upon myself as the
most unlucky of human beings, I esteemed myself the most
fortunate, in having been so strangely placed in a situation where
detection was impossible. As distasteful as it was to me to dress
in women's clothes, I now resolved not to abandon them until
some better disguise should be offered to me; and, after dinner,
I selected a dress from the wardrobe of Desire, and accepted of
some other articles from her mother, which completely transformed
me from a dashing lady of fashion, to a sedate and
modest Quakeress. Desire's dress was, in truth too small for
me, and I felt myself so pinched up, that I could hardly move in

<!-- Volume I, Page 116 -->

it, but she and her mother congratulated me on my improved
appearance, and when her father and brother came home at
night, they laughed heartily at the change, but said that I was
greatly improved. When they learned from the lips of the old
lady the story which I had told her, they expressed great compassion
for me, and Wilson threatened to go immediately in
pursuit of Mr. Ferocious to punish him for his villainy, but was
restrained by his father, who reproved him for his wrathful feelings.
But as he was prevented from showing his anger towards
Mr. Ferocious, he contented himself with showing a greater
degree of good feeling for me than he had done, and was so
amiable and tender that I was forced to keep my eyes continually
bent down to avoid his glances. When bed-time came, there
was quite a strife between Desire and her mother, and Wilson,
as to where I should sleep. The only spare bed-room happened
to be a small closet adjoining the chamber occupied by Wilson,
and both friend Goodwill and his wife, Rachel, said that, considering
all things, they thought it would be better that I should
sleep with Desire.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sarah," said Desire, looking kindly in my face, "thou
must sleep with me, and thou shall tell me about thy father and
mother, and sisters in the country."</p>

<p>I thanked Desire, and said that I would prefer sleeping alone,
for I had always slept alone at home.</p>

<p>"Yes, sister," said Wilson, "thou must not insist on Sarah's
doing anything against her will. If we are going to offer her a
home, let it be a home and not a prison to her. I think, mother,
that she had better occupy the little room adjoining mine. There
is a lock upon the door, and if she should be frightened in the
night we can all hear her."</p>

<p>"Wilson," said the old gentleman, "thou must allow thy
mother to know best. Sarah must sleep with Design, to-night, at
least, and to-morrow we must examine the lock upon the door of
the little room. Has thee any choice thyself, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I would prefer sleeping alone."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 117 -->

<p>"There, father," said Wilson "thou hears what Sarah says.
She must sleep alone. Stick to it, Sarah. It is only a whim of
father's wanting thee to sleep with Desire. I think, father, thee
must allow Sarah the privilege of doing as she likes. Poor
child! she will have to suffer hardships enough in the world;
and I think she will hardly wish to remain with us if we tyrannize
over her instead of controlling her by love, as Sophia Ruby
advised, thee knows."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Wilson is right," said his mother; "there is
nothing to fear from robbers, in the house, and if Sarah prefers
sleeping alone to sleeping with Desire, we will not constrain
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," said Wilson, rubbing his hands, "that is it;
thee is right. It is just what Sophia Ruby would advise, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"Well," said the old gentleman, "I will yield."</p>

<p>"There, there, Sarah!" said Wilson, taking my hand and
looking tenderly in my face, "thou hears what father says.
Thou shalt have thy own way, and no constraint shall be put
upon thy actions."</p>

<p>"But," said the old gentleman, "Sarah must occupy Desire's
room, and Desire shall sleep in the little chamber adjoining
Wilson's; and, then, if either should be alarmed at anything in
the night, she can call to us, and we shall hear."</p>

<p>"Yes, Yes," said Wilson, "that is very thoughtful in thee,
father; very much so. Thou sees, Sarah, how much regard
my father has for thee."</p>

<p>I was greatly relieved by this arrangement, for I had determined,
if they persisted in my sleeping with Desire, to leave the
house. The evening being now well advanced, friend Goodwill
said we had better all retire, for which I felt very thankful, and
having said good night to them all, Desire took a candle and
conducted me to the chamber which I was to occupy, and having
furnished me with a night-cap, and kissed me, she withdrew and
left me alone. I was too weary to delay undressing, and after

<!-- Volume I, Page 118 -->

disrobing myself and locking the door, I leaped into bed and fell
at once into a profound sleep, from which I was aroused about
midnight by a noise at my door. It was very plain that somebody
was trying to unlock it.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" I called, at the same time springing out of
bed.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" said a voice at the key-hole, which I
recognized as belonging to the rogue Wilson.</p>

<p>"I am frightened!" I said "I will call out for friend Goodwill!"</p>

<p>"Silence, it is I," said Wilson. "Open the door if thee is
frightened."</p>

<p>"No, no, I will call to your father, if you do not go away," I
said.</p>

<p>"Thee needn't, Sarah, I am going. Lie still. I thought thou
might be in want of something, and so I called; but don't say
anything about it. If thou shouldst want come water, there is
the Croton in the hall."</p>

<p>So the hospitable young gentleman withdrew himself, and I
fell asleep again, and lay undisturbed until the sound of the
breakfast-bell woke me in the morning.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p>A FISH out of water is a melancholy spectacle, unless, indeed,
it happen to be served up with butter and parsley, or with oyster
sauce, and then it can hardly be said to be out of its element.
But no fish floundering on a dry beach, or gasping in a basket,
ever felt itself more completely out of its proper sphere than I did
in friend Goodwill's house, dressed in the habiliments of a
woman, and compelled to conform to the prim manner of that
exemplary household. I was in continued fear of exposure from
the attentions both of the roguish Wilson, and the affectionate,

<!-- Volume I, Page 119 -->

tender-hearted Desire. The brother had the audacity to put his
arm around my neck and attempt to kiss me, as I was passing
through the hall, and his sister, feeling herself under no restraint,
hung about me in a manner quite distracting. Then, the old
lady read me lessons on propriety of conduct, and the old gentleman
hinted to me that it was necessary that I should find some
kind of employment by which I might earn my living; and
Sophia Ruby called in to talk to me about the importance of
cultivating the affections and tormented me to the last degree of
endurance, by questioning me as to the means employed by Mr.
Ferocious to induce me to leave my father's house. Poor Mr.
Ferocious! I believe that Mrs. Ruby entertains to this day the
opinion that he was a dreadful reprobate. But for my own part,
I am willing to confess that I never saw anything in his conduct
to lead me to believe that he was not as chaste as Adonis.
Although I was treated with the greatest kindness by these
benevolent people, yet, knowing myself to be entirely unworthy
of the least regard from them, I could hardly enjoy their well-meant
attentions. But the Irish servants in the kitchen showed
the greatest contempt for me, and refused to wait upon me, even
when they were required to do so by the mistress of the house.
This, however, I have always found to be the case, that the
lower you descend in the scale of refinement, the more intolerant
the people become towards transgressors, and so it has
always been, as Christ forgave the wretched woman whom his
followers would have stoned to death. The Goodwills and Mrs.
Ruby were people of the highest education, and most blameless
lives, yet, believing me to be a guilty woman, they felt themselves
bound to imitate the example of their Great Master, and by kindness
and forgiveness, to entice me back to the ways of virtue.
If I had been the wretch they thought me, I should have
abandoned my wicked ways and tried to become worthy of their
esteem, as my misfortunes would have rendered me an object
worthy of their love.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruby was not a Quaker in her habits; on the contrary,

<!-- Volume I, Page 120 -->

she loved all the beautiful objects in the world, which the people
of that unnatural sect make it a part of their religion to despise.
She talked continually about the beautiful, and surrounded herself
with everything that was pleasing in nature or art; she
loved birds, flowers, pictures, music, children, poetry and rainbows.
She was not fastidious in her tastes, but admired everything
that was beautiful, for the sake of its beauty. Thus, a
handsome man and a handsome woman was as much an object of
innocent admiration to her, as hyacinths or mocking-birds. It
was her religion to worship the Beautiful, and she saw in its endless
developments and forms, the Spirit of the Ruler of the
Universe, and as nature had not given her a form of perfect
beauty, she felt herself bound to make up her natural deficiencies
by all the means in her power, that she, as a part of the universe,
might not produce a discord in the sublime harmony of beauty
which pervaded it. All these things she told me, or I should not
have known them, for they sounded to me like down right
atheism. To imbue my mind with a love for the beautiful in art
and morals, she invited me to go with her to her house, which
was but a short distance from the house of friend Goodwill. It
was but a small house, but it was furnished in what seemed to
me a style of great magnificence. The walls were covered
with pictures, chiefly of beautiful saints, copied from Raffaelle,
Guido, Corregio and Titian. They were very bad copies, I have
no doubt, but I didn't know it, and she believed that the greater
part of them were undoubted originals. Then she had a vast
quantity of pink conch shells, and birds, in gilt cages, and gold
fish, in glass vases, and peacock's tails, and geraniums, and
other plants, in pretty china pots. After showing me all her
beautiful things, and telling me their history, and their correspondences
in the moral world, she invited me into her dressing-room,
which I called her <i>boudoir</i>; and was checked for it,
because she thought it wrong to speak a foreign language.
According to her theory, language should be a natural development
of the soul, and it was violating nature for an American

<!-- Volume I, Page 121 -->

soul to utter itself in French words.  This I thought a very
rational theory, but I couldn't avoid thinking that Mrs. Ruby
was shockingly inconsistent in her philosophy, when I saw her
take out a small pot of liquid <i>rouge</i>, and begin to mend her complexion
with it.  For, if French words were unbecoming to an
American soul, surely a French complexion was very far from
being proper for an American face. But I did not think myself
under any obligations to say exactly what I thought, and Mrs.
Ruby went on talking about the beautiful, and patching up her
complexion here and there; after which, she began to put some
coloring liquid upon her hair, which was a bright purple when
the light fell upon it.</p>

<p>"As for you, Sarah," said Mrs. Ruby, "you are not compelled
to aid nature in making yourself beautiful, because you are
beautiful already. But I suppose you do not think so of me?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I think you are very beautiful;" I replied, for I saw
that she wished me to say so; "and I am sure that your figure
is much better than mine."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so, Sarah?" she said. "But you are
such an impulsive creature, you say anything."</p>

<p>"Anything that I think, I say, of course," I replied.</p>

<p>"You are a mere child of nature, I see," said Mrs. Ruby,
"and you really think me beautiful? Well, Sarah, I was beautiful
once, but I am not so now, I know. You may think so, and
therefore I am so, to you, as every mother is beautiful to her
child.  But I am not so vain as to think that I am beautiful now,
merely because you tell me so. Young people have an instinctive
love for the beautiful, as bees have for flowers which contain
honey, but they are not analytical in their tastes; they love
things without knowing or caring why, and think that all is
beautiful that they do love. Now, you may love me, Sarah,
because I have been kind to you and praised you, and therefore
think that I am beautiful; but you could not tell why you think
so;" all the time she was looking in the glass, and arranging her
hair, and after awhile, having satisfied herself, she put on her

<!-- Volume I, Page 122 -->

hat and shawl, and we walked back to friend Goodwill's, where
she stayed to dinner.</p>

<p>While we sat at dinner, a carriage stopped at the door, and
Wilson and his father came in, bringing another subject with
them, a lady rather more unfortunate than myself, and, of course,
more deserving of the love and tender affections of these good
people, who graduated their compassion to the miseries of their
proteges, and ceased to have any regard for them the moment
they were in a condition to contribute to their own happiness.
Thus, their affection for me had sensibly diminished since they
had discovered that I was not entirely ruined, and if they had
known the truth respecting me, I fear that they would have had
but a very small amount of love to bestow upon me, and I am
quite sure that the feelings of the ardent Wilson would have
undergone considerable change. The arrival of the last subject
of benevolent sympathy excited the liveliest emotions of pity and
commiseration. She was a young woman, well formed, sprightly
and neatly dressed, with large gold rings in her ears, and a
Madras handkerchief tastefully tied upon her head, in the place
of a cap or bonnet; she had woolly hair, and her complexion
was a very dark bronze.</p>

<p>"Here is another subject, mother," said Wilson, as he exultingly
handed in the new comer, "that we have plucked from
slavery."</p>

<p>"Who is the wretch that claims this poor creature as his
property?" said Sophia Ruby; rising and offering the negress
her seat.</p>

<p>"Thee needn't inquire too particularly, Sophia," said the old
gentleman, as he took off his hat and smoothed down his hair over
his forehead; "he is a friend of ours, a customer from Louisiana,
who arrived in the city last night, on his way to the South.
He mentioned to me his fears that somebody might entice away
his wench, and I thought it would be as well to put an end to his
apprehensions at once, as he appeared to be uneasy in his mind."</p>

<p>"Thee sees, Sophia," said Wilson, rubbing his hands and

<!-- Volume I, Page 123 -->

smiling very quietly, "that father is more benevolent than I
should have been, for I proposed not to take her until to-morrow,
that our friend might enjoy his misery as long as convenient.
However, I hope he won't hang himself to-night, for there's a
small balance still due from him on the ledger."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruby and Desire both laughed at the sly humor of
Wilson, but Mrs. Goodwill having placed another plate upon the
table, said to the negress, "What is thy name friend?"</p>

<p>"Phillis, madame," she replied, with a slight French accent.</p>

<p>"Phillis, wilt thou eat some dinner? Come, sit down at the
table, thou art among friends; there is nothing to fear," said the
old lady.</p>

<p>But Phillis evidently thought there was abundant cause to
fear, and she kept casting uneasy glances towards the door, and
when she sat down at the table, was unable to eat anything, for
the tears kept falling from her eyes, and at last she withdrew
from the table, and fairly wept aloud.</p>

<p>"Poor creature!" said Desire, "how I pity thee!"</p>

<p>"She will soon get over it, daughter," said friend Goodwill,
who was now eating his dinner; "it always affects them that
way at first."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ruby, "the transition from slavery to freedom
is so sudden, and the change is so great, that we cannot
wonder at the feelings of these unsophisticated children of the
sun."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sophia," chimed in Wilson, suspending his fork between
his plate and his mouth, while he spoke, "think how thou
wouldst feel suddenly transposed from freedom to slavery; it's
the change that makes the feeling, and I dare say thou wouldst
bellow, too."</p>

<p>"Thee must not cry, Phillis," said Desire, in her sweet, persuasive
tone; "thou wilt be better cared for here than thou
wouldst have been in Louisiana.  Here thou wilt enjoy thy
freedom, and thy time will be thy own."</p>

<p>"There are more objects of the beautiful here than in the

<!-- Volume I, Page 124 -->

South," said Mrs. Ruby, "and when your taste becomes
developed, you will find more to sympathize with; your capacity
for enjoyment will be greater, and the circle of your over-soul
will be enlarged. You may go with me to my rooms, and I will
show you many works of the beautiful in art. We have no
mocking-birds in our fields, as you have at the South, and the
blossoms of the magnolia are neither so large nor so highly perfumed
as they are in your forests. But we have many beautiful
flowers, and delicious singing birds, which you will learn to love
in time; for everything that is beautiful is alike worthy of our
love."</p>

<p>But in spite of these encouraging prospects, Phillis continued
to sob, and seemed to have made up her mind not to be comforted
for the present.</p>

<p>"This is getting to be rather distressing," said the old gentleman,
who could not enjoy his dinner with such an accompaniment
to the music of his knife and fork, "what is the matter with
thee, Phillis; art thou afraid of being sent back to thy master?"</p>

<p>"No, massa," sobbed the wench.</p>

<p>"Then why do you cry?" said Mrs. Ruby, "or are these
tears of gratitude at being restored to your freedom, and all your
natural rights?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Desire, "she has left behind her some friend
to whom she was attached. Is it so, Phillis?"</p>

<p>"No, missus, dat's not it," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"The poor creature may be too conscientious to desert her
master," said the old lady.</p>

<p>"Well, if she is, I am too conscientious to allow her to go
back," said Wilson. "I am rather inclined to the belief that
her master will hang himself to-night, and if he does, the firm of
Goodwill &amp; Son will lose some hundreds of dollars. Come,
Phillis, what does ail thee? These friends are rather anxious
to know. I care nothing about it myself."</p>

<p>"Missus promised to buy me a shawl to-day," said Phillis,
bursting out a-fresh.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 125 -->

<p>"And you are crying for the loss of it?" said Mrs. Ruby;
"it is a hopeful sign of her love for the beautiful."</p>

<p>"Where is thy scarlet abomination, Sarah?" said Wilson.</p>

<p>I was very glad to have an opportunity of assisting these
benevolent people, and ran and brought the scarlet crape shawl
in which I had been taken, and threw it over the shoulders of the
weeping Phillis, whose grief was immediately changed to
a transport of joy. Friend Goodwill was greatly scandalized at
this exhibition of levity by the escaped slave, who showed herself
so incapable of appreciating the great blessing which had
been conferred upon her. But Mrs. Ruby said it was a very
gratifying development of the natural love of the beautiful.</p>

<p>"Thou art right" said the old gentleman; "why should not
Phillis be true to the impulses of her sex? Here is Sarah, who
probably would have lost more than her freedom for a red shawl,
and men every day peril their happiness for gew-gaws as trifling.
There is always a red shawl in the way, to draw men, as well
as women, from the important concerns of life. We must not
laugh at Phillis, for we all have some trifle to seduce us from duty."</p>

<p>The old gentleman and his son left the house soon after, and
Phillis was locked up in an upper chamber lest she should be
discovered. Sophia Ruby returned home, and when Wilson and
his father came back, we learned that it had been arranged for
the former to go off with the escaped slave, in the morning, to
some place in the country where an asylum had been established
for such subjects. But when bed time arrived the difficulties
of the night before, in respect to sleeping, were renewed, only
they were now more embarrassing than ever; for it was determined
that I should sleep either with Phillis or Desire; or else
that Desire and Phillis should sleep together. For my part, I
plumply refused to consent to the arrangement respecting
myself, and Desire as plumply refused to sleep with Phillis.</p>

<p>The old gentleman said that he thought I was more precise
than wise, and Desire, dear girl! with her sweet, persuasive
voice, good naturedly reproached me for my obstinacy.

<!-- Volume I, Page 126 -->

<p>"If thou wilt not sleep with my daughter, Desire," said the
old lady to me, "thou must go and sleep with Sophia Ruby; her
husband is not at home, and Wilson shall walk with thee to her
house, for it is getting late."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Wilson, "we must not treat Sarah so
inhumanly as to turn her out of doors at midnight. Sarah, thou
shalt not be used in that manner; I will give thee my own
room, and lie upon the parlor sofa." The rogue pressed my
hand warmly, and, looking into my face, added: "thou must not
give way to my sister's whims."</p>

<p>I was too much rejoiced at this offer to make any objections to
it, and it was at last arranged that I should sleep in Wilson's
room, while he occupied the sofa in the parlor. Before retiring
for the night, friend Goodwill whispered in my ear and told me
to be careful and see that my door was locked and well secured,
"for," he said, "there have been robberies committed in the
neighborhood, and if thou hears any noise, scream with all thy
might and alarm the house."</p>

<p>There was no need to give me this advice, for I had already
resolved to alarm the house if I should hear a mouse stirring.
But it so happened that I slept quietly through the night, and
awoke at daylight, greatly refreshed; so much so, in fact, that I
longed to be at liberty again, and as I looked at my drab-gown,
lying upon the floor, I felt such a disgust for womanly apparel,
that I resolved never to put it on again. It would be impossible
to keep my secret much longer, for the symptoms of a beard
were already apparent on my chin, and my voice was growing
rough and hard. A clothes-press in the room stood partly open,
and I saw that it contained a good many clothes, which I took
the liberty of inspecting, and found they were articles which I
stood most in need of. The only objection that I had to them,
was that they were all cut in the Quaker fashion. It was the
wardrobe of the rogue Wilson, and I soon equipped myself in a
complete suit of drab-colored clothes; the coat was cut extremely
plain, and fitted me exactly; the drawers of his bureau being

<!-- Volume I, Page 127 -->

unlocked, I selected a fine shirt and a white cravat, and when I
was completely dressed I was so entirely changed in appearance,
that I should not have known myself in a mirror. It was
early in the morning, and opening my chamber door, I listened,
but could hear no one stirring. I stepped softly but quickly
down the stairs, and finding Wilson's broad-brim hanging in the
hall, clapped it on my head, and the next moment I was in the
street.

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p>IN my anxiety to get free from women's clothes, it had never
once occurred to me that I had not a shilling in the world to pay
for a dinner, until, as I happened to pass a barber's shop, I remembered
that my long hair would not correspond with my
Quaker dress and I stepped in for the purpose of getting it cut,
and suddenly remembered that I had nothing to pay the barber
with. As the morning was chilly, the air bracing, and the walk
I had already taken was rather long, with the recollection of my
want of money, came a demand from the gastric juices of my
system for something to feed upon. The love of money is, unquestionably,
the root of evil, but the want of it is evil itself.
The law should make some distinction between the penniless
wretch who robs to satisfy the demands of his appetite, and the
wealthy rogue who wrongs his neighbor to satisfy the cravings
of avarice. But, as to that, the law does make a distinction, and
visits the crime of the starving wretch with the hardest punishment.
There are certain philanthropic fanatics in the world,
who are trying to reorganize society, and so arrange human affairs,
that no man shall suffer for the means of living, who may
consider life worth preserving. Such a proposition is hooted at
by the rich and well-to-do, who denounce it as atheistical and
anti-Christian; in proof of which they quote the saying of Christ,

<!-- Volume I, Page 128 -->

"The poor ye have with you always;" arguing therefrom that
an attempt to banish poverty from the world, would be flying in
the face of Scripture. I do not remember to have seen any better
reason than this, for denouncing the fanatics who claim that
those to whom God has given life have a right to live; and that
the constitution guaranties to every one living under it equal
privileges.  A man who has never known what it is to want;
who has never been placed in the midst of a populous and wealthy
city, without a penny in his pocket, and with heaps of money
and stores of luxuries all around him, can ever fully conceive
the real meaning of poverty. In the forest, on the ocean, or by
the sea-side, one cannot experience that feeling of destitution which
want produces in the midst of a city, because there is no one to
forbid the taking of whatever may be caught: there are nuts in
the forest, though they may be but acorns; there are shell fish
on the sea-shore, and there are waifs on the ocean, which may
be enjoyed without danger of a prison. But the city affords
nothing to the stranger in want; everything there has an owner:
a straw cannot be picked up in the street without peril; whatever
you may have, you will be allowed to keep, but you must
not touch anything you see, let your necessities be what they
may. In a large city it must often happen that some unlucky
victim of circumstances will be destitute of the means of sustaining
life. His wants are immediate and pressing. He goes into
the streets and wanders through a maze of superfluous wealth,
yet cannot touch even a grain of corn. If he were drowning, a
thousand men would jump to rescue him, but if he is starving,
not a hand will be extended to aid him; his rags excite no sympathy,
his hungry looks bring him no bread. Society, which
has monopolized all the wealth, makes no provision for him; the
law does not recognize the man in need. If he were dead, he
would be an object worth caring for; society would provide him
a shroud and a grave; but living, she does not recognize him.
The law being framed by men who have never known want
themselves, they have made no provision for such a phenomenon.

<!-- Volume I, Page 129 -->

There are no convent gates to which he may apply for relief;
the churches only supply spiritual food, and the injunction of the
Master, "Feed my lambs," is interpreted "preach to them."
You may have a Bible for the asking, and tracts without demanding
them, but you can apply nowhere for bread. All the philanthropy
of the age, all the Protestantism, all the missionaries
and Bibles, all the reforms, and battles with might for right, end
at last in this,&mdash;that a human being without money, if placed in
the midst of a large city, has but two alternatives before him&mdash;either
to starve or to steal. A few starve, but a good many steal,
and a tenth part of the cost of putting the thieves into prison, and
the dead into graves, would supply an asylum which would have
kept these wretches alive and honest.</p>

<p>As philanthropy is fashionable, and every man without a fortune
a reformer, it will not be out of place if I suggest a plan
for keeping men from starving and stealing. Let the city erect
a house proportionate to its size, or two or three of them in
different parts of it, in which various branches of industry shall
be established; let it be called by some name which does not
imply disgrace, as the City Hotel, the Public Restaurant, or anything
but a poor house; let it be always open, and when any man,
woman, or child applies for food or shelter, let it be supplied,
and be paid for in labor, so that the city shall lose nothing, and
the person relieved shall suffer no degradation from eating the
bread of the pauper. If such an establishment existed in the
cities of the Union, there would be fewer calls for coroner's inquests,
and less call for a day and night police.</p>

<p>A boy of seventeen, in full health, and who had never suffered
from actual want, was not likely to be troubled with many
thoughts about the duties of society, but distress quickens the
perception wonderfully, and even while I stood in the barber's
shop, thinking of the consequences of having neither money nor
employment, a plan, something like the above, suggested itself
to me; but I did not think long enough about it to invent any
details, for, putting both hands into my coat pockets, as if to feel

<!-- Volume I, Page 130 -->

for my pocket-book, which I was going to pretend I had left at
home, my right hand fell upon a little wallet, which, upon examination,
I found contained fifteen dollars in bank bills. My
heart bounded at the sight; but the next moment I blushed at
the thought of keeping what did not belong to me. However, I
persuaded myself to keep the money, and repay it at a more convenient
season. Perhaps some very honest, or only passably
honest reader, will say that I should have returned the money
immediately, and not have left it to the chances and contingencies
of life to make restitution at some after time; but all this knew I
perfectly well at the time, though having committed one wrong, I
was compelled, or thought I was compelled, to commit another to
cover it up. Besides, I was greatly in need of the money myself,
and Wilson, I knew, could well afford to do without it. So I
sat down in the barber's chair, and told him to cut my hair close.
The man said it was a pity to out off such beautiful hair, for it
hung down upon my shoulders, and curled naturally. But,
knowing that it would soon grow out again, I was perfectly willing
to be deprived of it, and told him to make use of his scissors
at once, for I was in a hurry for my breakfast, or I should go
in search of another shop. So the barber cropped my hair close,
which altered my appearance very much, and with my Quaker
clothes, I do not believe that even Captain St. Hugh would have
recognized me. After leaving, the barber's shop I found out a
French restaurant, and treated myself to a breakfast of chocolate
and an omelet; and, on looking into the morning papers, I
again saw myself advertised, and a large reward offered for my
discovery. I never once questioned the motives of Mr. Bassett,
or Captain St. Hugh, in trying to discover me, for feeling conscious
of having deceived them by false representations respecting
myself, I thought that they only wanted to find me that they
might punish me. But I had taken leave of my former self.
I was Tom Pepper no longer, and henceforth I was to become a
new man. I did not determine to leave all my former associations
without some bitterness of feeling, and a good many struggles.

<!-- Volume I, Page 131 -->

I longed once more to see beautiful little Sylvia Swayne,
and her good mother; I had not lost a particle of the love which
I had felt for Mr. Bassett and Captain St. Hugh, nor felt the least
disposition to be revenged on Mrs. Bassett, or the family of the
book-keeper. I could have sat down and wept at the thought of
never again seeing any of the good friends who had shown me a
kindness, and for whom I found that I entertained a warmer
affection than I had suspected. The tender, hazel-eyed Desire,
the good hearted lover of the beautiful, Mrs. Ruby, the bewitching
Sylvia, and even the mild-spoken and grand-motherly friend
Goodwill, were all endeared to me, but I could never see them
again. The past was a dream to me. I had, by my own folly,
deprived myself of all the advantages which fortune had bestowed
upon me. But it was some consolation to me to reflect,
that no one but myself suffered from my wrong doing. At least,
I consoled myself with such a thought, for I did not then know
that wickedness is twice cursed, and that there are no solitary
sufferers from falsehood. Mr. Bassett had taught me that every
transgression of God's law will surely meet its due punishment;
but he had not told me that the innocent must suffer from the
sins of the guilty. This I learned afterwards to my great sorrow.
I vainly imagined that because I had intended no harm to
any one, that none would be would be suffered by my deceits, and I said,
"Well, if I have lied, I am the only sufferer." I now saw very
plainly that all my trouble had come to me from neglecting to
speak the truth always, and upon all occasions. I little dreamed,
when I gave a false name to Captain St. Hugh, that so trifling a
deviation from the truth would bring such a heavy punishment.
But I was now convinced that falsehood in any degree could not
be tampered with, and I vowed to myself that I would never
again be guilty of practicing a deception. I was still young
enough to begin the world truthfully, and establish a character
for veracity, and as I now knew all the benefits of candor and
all the evils of deceit, I could have no excuse for falsehood or
double dealing.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 132 -->

<p>But before I could begin to be anybody, it was necessary to
determine who I was. I had assumed so many characters, that
I was rather puzzled to know which one of right belonged to me,
particularly when looked into the mirror opposite to the table
where I sat, and saw my Quaker clothes and close-cropped hair.
It was so long since I had been Tom Pepper, that I had forfeited
all claim to the name and character of that unfortunate boy; besides,
the name of Tom Pepper was only bestowed upon me for
temporary purposes, until I could learn the name of my father,
to which I was properly entitled. As for the name of Eustace
St. Hugh, although it had been bestowed upon me by a blow
from a sword, it was clearly not mine by right, and I resolved
not to claim it again: my last name, of Sarah Martin, was of
course out of the question. So I stood alone in the world, without
name or connection, like Adam when he woke into being,
from a state of non-existence, and found himself a mature man
in his infancy. But I had this advantage of Adam, I knew
something of the world, and I had a good suit of clothes. My
past life was a dream, which I resolved to forget as soon as possible,
and that I might begin at once to be somebody else, it was
necessary that I should christen myself with a new name. I
was not very fastidious, and soon determined upon one that would
fit the initials with which my clothes were all marked&mdash;W.
G.</p>

<p>To prevent the difficulty which I had experienced with Captain
St. Hugh, from calling myself a Bostonian, I resolved that I
would be an Englishman, and as I had learned from him a good
many particulars about Lancashire, and Blackmere, I fixed upon
that part of England as my birth place. My name should be
Walter Grimshaw, which sounded foreign, and this I resolved
to stick to through thick and thin.</p>

<p>My next object was to find some kind of employment, and
now I felt the inconveniences of not being bred to a trade. I
could do nothing that was useful, and was entirely at a loss where
to look for occupation, but unless I did look it was very certain

<!-- Volume I, Page 133 -->

that I should not find any. So I first examined the morning
papers, but not with much hope of seeing an advertisement for a
young gentleman who was not qualified for anything in particular,
which was fortunate for me, because I was not so much disappointed
at not seeing such a one. I found one advertisement
which almost suited me; it was for a partner with a cash capital
of fifty dollars. But that was considerably above my mark, and
I thought that I had lost a very favorable opportunity for commencing
business for the lack of a few dollars. There was no
thing for me now but to seek employment wherever I could find it;
the restaurant at which I had breakfasted being in the neighborhood
of Wall street, I went into that busy mart with a vague expectation
that somebody might make me a present of a few hundred
dollars, or invite me to accept a situation in an office where the
duties were light and the pay large, or propose to take me into
partnership in some profitable business. But all such wild expectations
soon vanished when I saw how intensely interested
every man seemed to be in his own affairs, and how little notice
anybody bestowed upon me. In a walk through the woods, I
always encountered something to notice me; the squirrels would
eye me with curiosity when they were out of my reach, and the
ground moles would run from me as they heard the tread of my
feet among the dry leaves; but here the crowd rushed by me
without recognizing me. I was no more to them than a stick
or a stone. But the bustle of the street was infectious, and I
hurried along with the rushing crowd as though I too had a mission
to discharge, a note at bank to pay, or a bill to collect, or a
deposit to make, or differences to settle. I had enough to do in
truth, for I had employment to find, a character to establish, and
a fortune to make. But how to accomplish these things I knew
not. In the innocency of my heart I went into two or three
banks and asked if they wanted to hire anybody to count money,
for it struck me that I should be quite equal to such employment
as that.  But I met with no encouragement from the men to
whom I applied. Then I asked for employment in a money broker's

<!-- Volume I, Page 134 -->

office, and in an insurance office; at last I stepped into a
very small, and very dark office, in the basement of a high
building, and without knowing or caring what the business
might be which the occupant followed, I asked boldly if he
wanted an assistant.</p>

<p>"An assistant!" exclaimed a gruff voice, "pray, in what
manner do you propose to assist me?"</p>

<p>The voice came from an elderly looking man with an immense
head, who sat at a little desk writing. But it was so dark that I
could not readily distinguish him, until I had been some minutes
in his presence. He was the sole occupant of the office, which
was dusty, cramped up, and poorly furnished. There were only
three rickety old chairs, and a little pine desk, besides the desk
and the chair which the old man occupied. There were stains of
ink on the wall, and cobwebs in the window, and dust on everything.
The old gentleman seemed to be a part of the furniture
of the office, for he was dusty, slouchy, and apparently out of
order. He was a large framed man, with shoulders like a giant,
and a monstrously large head, which appeared the larger from
his wearing a very rough, foxy-looking wig. He was dressed in
a blue coat, which hung loosely about him, and he wore a white
cambric cravat, tied in a crooked knot, which he had contrived
to slip under his right ear. He had a broad, hard-looking face,
which was not much improved by a stream of tobacco juice
which ran from both corners of his wide mouth. His appearance
made a strong impression upon me, because it was so widely different
from anything that I had seen in the street. Everybody
there looked jaunty, precise and fashionable; but this old fellow
might have passed for a hermit in some secluded dell, so serious
was he in his countenance, so solemn in his voice, and so careless
in his habiliments.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't know in what manner I can assist you," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Then how can I know whether or not I want you," he
said.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 135 -->

<p>Emboldened by this reply, I said, "Perhaps it would be nearer
the truth to say that it was I who wanted assistance."</p>

<p>"Ha! what do you want?" he said, looking sternly at me,
with his mouth half open, while a small rill of tobacco juice
trickled from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I want employment by which I can earn my living," I replied.</p>

<p>"Are you good for anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Try me, and see," I replied.</p>

<p>"Take this letter to the Post Office" he said, reaching me a
package, "and let me see how long you are about it."</p>

<p>I caught the letter and ran with it. I had never been at the
Post Office, and didn't know where to find it, but I enquired the
way, and as soon as I had dropped the letter into the box hurried
back to the little dusty office.</p>

<p>"So you are good for something; you can run, it seems,"
growled the old fellow as I re-entered.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"England," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" said the monster, lifting up his head and taking a
look at me, which he had not done before, "you are a John
Bull, are you? What part of England did you run away from,
Yorkshire?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "Lancashire."</p>

<p>"Lancashire, ah! Did you ever see a witch there?"</p>

<p>"Never, that I remember," I said.</p>

<p>"You are a Quaker too, ha! Well friend, how old art thou?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen," I replied, for I had determined to be that age.</p>

<p>"And what did you say your name was?"</p>

<p>"Walter Grimshaw."</p>

<p>"Ah! I knew somebody of that name once; he was a Quaker
too, and a great rogue he was; he cheated me out of a thousand
dollars; but I guess you are not a relation of his, you look too
honest."</p>

<p>The old gentleman took up a pile of loose papers that lay on

<!-- Volume I, Page 136 -->

his desk, put them in his hat and stood up. He was so tall that
he had to stoop as he went out of the door; his whole dress,
gait, and speech, harmonized in a marvelous manner. His hat
sat loosely on his head, and the rim was turned up behind; his
trowsers hung about his heels, and his mouth hung down half
open. But notwithstanding his huge, ungainly figure, and the
general slovenliness of his making up, he had a pleasant, boyish
look in the face; his complexion was fresh, and his face was
smoothly shaven. He had pleasant greyish eyes, which were
only half seen, for it seemed to be too much trouble for him to
keep his eye-lids wide open.</p>

<p>"I am going out for an hour, Walter," he said, "sit down at
my desk, and if anybody should come in tell them I shall be
back before the banks close."</p>

<p>And without another word being said he went out and closed
the door after him.</p>

<p>I felt, at first, rather elevated at this evidence of confidence
in my integrity from an entire stranger, but on examining the office
more closely, I perceived that I had no great cause to congratulate
myself on that score. There was nothing on the premises
worth carrying away; an old inkstand, a couple of rusty steel
pens, some loose bank checks, and a box of wafers comprised the
entire desk furniture of the office. There was nothing even from
which I could learn the name of my new employer, but the back
of an old check-book, which bore the initials G. G. Neither
was there a sign at the door, from which I inferred that he must
be somebody too well known to require a sign, or any other
notice of his place of business. I had not been seated long
before a gentleman came in, with a flushed face, and inquired:
"Where's Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"He will be back before the banks close," I replied, and the
flushed gentleman darted out again.</p>

<p>So, I had learned one of my employer's names. Gilbert.
Presently, another gentleman dashed in, and seeing me at the
desk exclaimed: "Where's that old Gilson?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 137 -->

<p>I replied as before, and the gentleman dashed out again,
exclaiming as he went, "Confound him!"</p>

<p>So, I was in a fair way of picking up all the parts of my
employer's name. Gilbert Gilson, or Gilson Gilbert, I knew
not which. Directly, the door of the office opened, and a round,
glossy, and quiet gentleman stepped quietly in, and looking at
me, took a pinch of snuff from a tortoise shell box which he held
in his hand, and brushing off one or two particles which fell upon
his satin vest, he remarked quietly, "So, the old gentleman is
not in?" and disappeared again in the same smooth manner in
which he had entered.</p>

<p>All these movements were highly interesting to me, and kept
my thoughts busy trying to imagine who these men were, and
what they could want of old Gilson, and who and what old Gilson
himself could be. It was not long after the last gentleman disappeared
when another came in, puffing and wiping the sweat
from his forehead; reaching me a piece of paper which he held
in his hand, he said: "Tell Gil it's no go. Too much shave.
Everybody knows it in the street. There'll be an awful smash
somewhere. Lord! how hot is!" and then he disappeared.
What could he mean by the heat? I was half frozen; there
was no fire in the grate, and the office being a subterranean one,
it was damp and chilly.</p>

<p>While I sat wondering at the last apparition, there came
another who rushed in, holding the door open in hand, and
exclaimed: "Tell Gil, Pickings &amp; Company is O. K.," and
immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the door closed than it was opened again, and I
recognized a voice which I had heard before.</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Gilson is not in," said the last comer, "it's very
strange, very strange. An individual, I name no names, makes
an appointment with a certain person, at a particular hour,
and when that hour arrives, a certain person calls upon that individual,
and he is not to be found. But it would be quite a
work of supererogation to demand an explanation of a subordinate

<!-- Volume I, Page 138 -->

of that individual's&mdash;I don't mean you, of course. But, sir,
if you please, you can inform Mr. Gilbert Gilson that a certain
person called upon him according to appointment, and not finding
that individual in his office, where he should have been, that
person, I name no names, will in future expect Mr. Gilbert Gilson
to call at a certain person's office. The name of that person
is Jasper Ferocious, but I don't wish you to say anything
about it. Keep dark, close, deep." And having uttered these
mysterious words, Mr. Ferocious withdrew, leaving me in a
cold sweat, lest I should be recognized by him.</p>

<p>After this, there was a dead calm for half an hour, when I
heard the voice of my employer in the passage way, uttering
brief sentences like these: "I can't!  I am hard up! I won't!"
To which another voice replied: "You must! I shall be
smashed! You must do it, Gil!"</p>

<p>Then the voices ceased, and I heard nothing more; old Gil
did not return, and as I listened to the shuffling of feet on the
pavement over my head, I kept wondering who and what he was,
until my brain was filled with the wildest fantasies respecting
him. The tread of feet grew fainter and fainter, no one came
near the office, it was getting darker and darker, and the little
office grew so dim that I could scarcely distinguish the forms of
the old chairs, or see on which side of it the door was. I had just
determined to leave the dismal old hole, when I heard a hand on
the door; I rose up, expecting to see old Gil enter, but instead, I
heard the lock click, and jumping to the door, found it was
locked.</p>

<p>Finding myself locked up in a place of which I was already
heartily sick, I began to see how I could effect an escape.
There was but one window to the office, which opened upon the
area in front, which was covered by an iron grating overhead,
and escape that way was impossible. I tried, but without success,
to force back the bolt of the door, and then called with all
my might for somebody to let me out. But nobody came to my
assistance. The street, indeed, which so lately had been filled

<!-- Volume I, Page 139 -->

with hurrying crowds, was now as silent as a cemetery. It soon
grew dark, and finding that all attempts to escape without breaking
open the door, were useless, I resigned myself to my fate,
knowing that I should be released in the morning, and comforting
myself with the reflection that I should save the expense of a
lodging.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p>"HOLLO!" exclaimed old Gil, as he unlocked the office door
the next morning, and started back in alarm as he saw me sitting
at his old desk, "how got you there?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you leave me here?" I replied.</p>

<p>"And did I lock you in? and have you been here all night?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have; how could I get out?"</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw!" roared the old man. "Well, you are
good stuff, Grimshaw. I forgot you. I don't want you, I must
confess to you, but I like your patience, and your good nature.
But you must be hungry. So, take this money, and go and get
yourself a good breakfast at one of the coffee-houses, and then
come back to me."</p>

<p>As I was almost famished, and trembling with cold, I caught
at the money and ran for the nearest eating-house, and after
recruiting myself with a beef steak and some coffee, and refreshing
myself with a bath, I returned to the office of old Gil whom
I found sitting at his desk with a heap of papers before him, just
as I had found him the day before.</p>

<p>"Well, Grimshaw," said the old man, "you want to assist me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I want to assist you for the sake of being
assisted myself."</p>

<p>"Well, I like that, Grimshaw; that's honest," said old Gil,

<!-- Volume I, Page 140 -->

looking me in the face; "come, sit down by me, and let me see
what you are made of. That's the only principle in Wall street,
never to give something for nothing. Everybody don't profess
it, but they all strive to act up to it, and such as do not, fail and
become poor devils. Always keep that principle in your mind,
and act accordingly, and you will be president of a bank one of
these days. Never give something for nothing."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "must I reverse the principle, and never take
something for which I give nothing?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a different matter," said he; "you must always
get what you can, and if you can get it for nothing, why, that's
all the better. But, be honest, whatever you do, because cheat
in play will never prosper."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall never be otherwise," I said.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you will, unless you go into speculations; but
that there is no danger of your doing yet awhile. However,
it's best to be cautious, Grimshaw; I suppose you have got a recommendation?</p>

<p>I confessed to him that I had none, and could give no references
whatever as to my character, and that if he took me into
his service at all, he must take me upon trust.</p>

<p>"Well, that's honest, Grimshaw. I don't believe you resemble
your namesake, whom I knew, for he was a most shocking
liar. You have an honest face and an honest coat; I like the
Quakers. Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Blackmere, in Lancashire," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, I remember; Walter Grimshaw, of Blackmere. Well,
Walter, I will take you for an assistant in my business, because
you are a stranger, and know nothing of the ways of this wicked
city; and to keep you out of harm's way, you may come and
live in my family. I don't like these boarding-house fellows,
and that's the reason why I have had no assistant before. Are
you willing to live with me, Grimshaw?"</p>

<p>Of course I was.</p>

<p>"Well, I have got some daughters, but I have got no boys;

<!-- Volume I, Page 141 -->

perhaps you can find some means of amusing yourself at my
house. Sit down at my desk and say that I shall be back in an
hour, if there should be any calls for me."</p>

<p>He then filled his hat full of papers, and left the office with the
ends of his white cravat sticking out from under his right ear, as
usual, for he had a very short neck, and his cravat always contrived
to slip round, with the knot under his ear. As he never
troubled himself to look into a glass, he was quite unconscious
of this awkward derangement of his dress, as he was of the two
streamlets of tobacco juice which ran down from the corners of
his mouth, and sometimes dripped upon his shirt bosom, which
usually gaped open, and revealed a red flannel wrapper underneath.
He had not been gone a moment when he returned, and
said:</p>

<p>"Grimshaw, was there an individual here yesterday, who
called himself Ferocious?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and he said if a certain individual wished to see a
certain person, he must call at that person's office," I answered.</p>

<p>"He didn't name any names, I suppose," said old Gil.</p>

<p>"No, he particularly said he didn't," I replied.</p>

<p>"He never does; and he called me an individual, did he?
Well, I will get the little man in a corner directly," and so saying
he again left the office. It was not long before people began to
rush in and ask for "old Gil," "the old man," "the old gentleman,"
"Gilbert," "Mr. Gilson," and half a dozen more different names,
by which my employer was called in Wall street. I soon found
out the nature of his business, and was inducted into all its
mysteries and technicalities. He was a note shaver, besides
being a negotiator of paper of all kinds. I found that it was his
practice to partially promise to loan as much money as he
expected to have at his disposal, and then when his customers
should call, contrive to be out of the way until a few minutes
before three o'clock, the hour at which the banks close their
doors, when he would happen to fall in the way of his distressed
customers, who, having no other recourse, were obliged to pay

<!-- Volume I, Page 142 -->

him whatever interest he had the conscience to charge them;
and his conscience being regulated altogether by their supposed
necessities and ability to pay, he used to deduct a rather heavier
rate of interest than the law authorized. In reality, he was an
outlaw, and his little office was a real robber's den, where the
public were robbed of their earnings as effectually as though
they had fallen into the hands of some Fra Diavola among the
Appenines. But the law makes its own outlaws. As the custom-house,
the priests, the nobility, the protective tariffs, the feudal
tenures, the legal church, and the primogeniture of Italy, make
their Fra Diavolas and their Rinaldo Rinaldinos, so do our
debtor's prisons and usury laws make the Old Gils and outlaws
of Wall street. While I remained in the service of Mr. Gilson,
a man one day brought a petition into the office, and asked him
to sign it.</p>

<p>"What is it for?" said old Gil; "to give everybody a farm
and a family?"</p>

<p>"No, it is better than that," said the man; "it is a petition to
the Legislature to allow every man equal privileges in striving
to get a farm, by repealing the usury laws."</p>

<p>"Take it away! out of my sight with it!" said the old man,
working himself into a passion; "do you think I will sign a
petition to deprive my children of their bread and butter?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," replied the man, "if you repeal the usury laws,
you will be able to collect the debts which they render null."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said old Gil, contemptuously, "if the usury
laws were repealed I should have no debts to collect. Do you
think I could ever get ten or fifteen per cent. for my money, if
the law allowed my customers to pay me exactly what it is worth?
No, no; it is the risk of lending at usury which gives
me my increase. My debts are now all debts of honor; they
are more easy to collect than legal debts. Take your petition
away. If you make free trade in money-lending, you will ruin
my business."</p>

<p>The next day old Gil returned to his office at the hour

<!-- Volume I, Page 143 -->

appointed, about fifteen minutes before the banks closed, and
just in time to relieve the wants of two poor devils of jobbers,
who were so excited and nervous that they could hardly speak.
But the old usurer knew that they were waiting for him, and
kept away from his office on purpose, knowing that a difference
of five minutes in time would make a difference to him of at
least five per cent. in the interest they would be wiling to pay.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Gilson," exclaimed one of the jobbers, as
the old man came in, "where have you been? I must have a
thousand dollars. Here take the collaterals and give me the
money. It is almost three o'clock, and my credit will be ruined
if I get protested to-day!"</p>

<p>"And how much do you want, Faxon?" said the old man to
the other jobber, not seeming to have heard what the first had
been saying.</p>

<p>"Double the amount that Dobson wants," replied Faxon, looking
at his watch anxiously.</p>

<p>"It's too much. I can't do it. I have drawn too close
already," said old Gil, sitting down at his desk.</p>

<p>"You must! You shall!" exclaimed the two jobbers simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Come, Come," said Faxon "I know you can, and you must.
Here's security to four times the amount. Be quick! it's almost
three!"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, Faxon," said the old man, as he took the collaterals
and looked at their amounts, "there's time enough. Don't
get excited. You have got five minutes to spare."</p>

<p>"Gil!" said Dobson, as he wiped the sweat from his
forehead, "I am a ruined man if you don't give me a check at
once!"</p>

<p>"If I do it I shall be ruined myself," said my employer; "do
you think they will take my check at the bank, Grimshaw?"</p>

<p>"I dare say they will," I replied, at a venture.</p>

<p>"Well, if you think so, I will see what I can do," he replied,
and taking a couple of checks from his hat, he filled them up

<!-- Volume I, Page 144 -->

and reached them to the jobbers, who immediately darted out of
the office without stopping to make any acknowledgments.</p>

<p>"Now, Grimshaw," said the old man, as he stuffed his hat
full of the papers which his two customers had left with him,
"let us go home and get some dinner; I will take you on trial
for a while, and if I find that you understand yourself, you shall
have your board, and something for clothes, and pocket money.
Come."</p>

<p>I followed him out, and he locked the door and put the key in
his pocket. We rode in an omnibus to the upper part of the
city, and having landed at Twenty something street, we walked
a few blocks until we came to a tall brick house with a granite
basement, having a bronzed door, with a broad silver plate upon
it, bearing the inscription, GILBERT GILSON, in German text.
This was his residence, of course, and I now learned, for the
first time, his real name. We entered, and found in the front
parlor, a lively-looking young lady, with flaxen ringlets, playing
upon a pianoforte; as she kept on playing and singing without
regarding us, her father said: "Pauline, don't you see I have a
stranger with me?"</p>

<p>"O, father!" she said, turning round, "is it you?"</p>

<p>"Is it I? Of course. And this is friend Grimshaw, from
England.  This is my daughter, Grimshaw; she is just two
years younger than you. I believe you are sixteen, Pauline, or
is it your sister Winnifred?"</p>

<p>"I am sixteen," replied the young lady, rising from the pianoforte,
and making me a curtsy.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Grimshaw," said old Gil, as he took a seat himself,
"my other daughters will be in presently. Where are
your mother and sisters, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"I will call them, sir," said Pauline, and ran out of the parlor.</p>

<p>"I have some more daughters, Grimshaw, but I believe I told
you that I have no son, excepting two sons-in-law, who live in
the next street."</p>

<p>Well, thought I, if they are all as bewitching in their looks as

<!-- Volume I, Page 145 -->

Pauline, how shall I help falling dead in love with them? I
wonder how many there are, and what the old gentleman means
by "some?" Little Sylvia Swayne was a lovely child, and
Desire Goodwill was surpassingly beautiful, but such a perfectly
fascinating creature as Pauline I had never dreamed of. She
had a round, dimpled face, light blue eyes, flaxen ringlets, and a
mouth full of pearly teeth. I could see no more, but I heard her
voice, which was sweeter than a bob-o'-link's. Old Gil's
parlor was well filled with rosewood chairs and sofas, mahogany
tables, large mirrors, and mantel ornaments of ormolu and Sevres
china. There was a harp in one corner, and a music-stand filled
with music-books; there were two easy-chairs, lined with purple
velvet, and the window drapery was of some kind of rich stuff,
embroidered with silver flowers. But there were no pictures.
This magnificence gave me an extravagant idea of his wealth;
but I could not help thinking, as I looked at the rich furniture,
that it had been purchased at the expense of such distressed
jobbers as Faxon and Dobson, whom he had just left. Old Gil
seemed strangely out of place in his his handsome parlor, his huge
frame and slovenly dress contrasted oddly with the elegancies
and luxuries with which he was surrounded. Directly the door
opened, and in ran two charming girls, one about five years, and
the other probably a twelve-month older. They began to climb
up the old man's knees, and having succeeded, they put their
arms around his neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>"You don't love father," said old Gil.</p>

<p>"We do! we do!" said the little creatures, and again put
their arms round his neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>"These are my youngest daughters, Grimshaw," said the old
man, seating one on each knee. "Agnes is the youngest, and
Magdalen is the next. That young man is friend Grimshaw,
children; he has come to live with us." The children looked
at me curiously, and then began to search the old man's pockets,
from which one of them fished up a Seckel pear, and the other a
paper of figs.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 146 -->

<p>"Where are your sisters, Agnes?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"They are dressing, because there is a stranger here," replied
the little prattler, probably revealing a secret she was charged
not to divulge.</p>

<p>"Ah! they will be here directly, Grimshaw," he said. And
directly they came in.</p>

<p>"This is my daughter Lizzy," said old Gil, as a tall, sedate
girl, with jet black hair, and full, dark eyes, entered. Lizzy
smiled graciously upon me as I rose and bowed to her; she was
the very opposite of Pauline, but not so old.</p>

<p>"Ah! here's Nancy," said her father; "my daughter, this is
Mr. Grimshaw. And this is Matilda, Grimshaw, my oldest
daughter. Are you better to-day, daughter?"</p>

<p>"A little, I think," replied the last comer, in a feeble voice,
"I am getting better of my cough."</p>

<p>Matilda looked as though she might have been handsome once,
but she was very pale and thin, and her tall figure was slightly
bent. She walked quietly across the room, and drawing her
shawl tightly round her shoulders, sat upon the sofa and began to
cough. I saw at a glance that she was far gone in a consumption.</p>

<p>A fine looking woman now came in; she was tall and rather
stout, but she looked hardly older than Matilda.</p>

<p>"This is my wife, Grimshaw," said old Gil, and I thought
that I perceived something like an air of exultation in his voice
as he spoke. "This is the young man I spoke about, my dear,
Mr. Grimshaw, from England.  Mrs. Gilson is a Lancashire
woman herself, Grimshaw."</p>

<p>I trembled to hear it, but felt reassured when she reached me
her hand, and said:</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you. It is a great many years since I left
Lancashire, but I am happy to see one of my countrymen."

<p>"Where are the other girls?" said old Gil.</p>

<p>What! were there more?</p>

<p>"Here are Maria and Judith, just come home," said Mrs.

<!-- Volume I, Page 147 -->

Gilson, as two more young ladies entered, who were dressed
alike, and looked exactly alike. I learned afterwards that they
were twins. These last bore a striking resemblance to their
father; they were about nineteen, and rather shy in their manners,
holding each other by the hand, and seeming afraid of
being separated.</p>

<p>These are the last, thought I, as their father presented me
to them. But they were not.  Maria and Judith had scarcely
curtsied to me, when in walked four more, whose ages ranged
from ten up to fifteen. They were laughing hoydens, full of
life and fun, and their father introduced each to me separately,
as Rachel, Charlotte, Caroline and Love.</p>

<p>The clock struck four, and the servant announced dinner.</p>

<p>"Come, Grimshaw, come, children," said the patriarch of
the flock, "let us go to dinner."</p>

<p>I offered my arm to the invalid, Matilda, and followed the troop
through the hall into the dining-room, which was in a building
connected with the house by a narrow passage. The old man
looked like a different person at the head of his table, with his
large flock seated around him, to what when sitting at his old
desk, in his little dusty office.</p>

<p>"Whose turn is it to ask a blessing to-day?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It's sister Paul's to-day," said little Agnes, "because it was
Rachel's yesterday."</p>

<p>"So it is. Implore a blessing, Pauline," said her father.</p>

<p>A blessing on a usurer's dinner! thought I. But when
Pauline, with her sweet voice, implored a blessing from on high,
the dinner seemed blessed to me; and candor compels me to
admit, that the dinner was a blessed good one. Old Gil being an
elder in a Presbyterian church, doubtless had sufficient faith
in the efficacy of prayer; but to make sure of a blessing on his
dinner, he had the good sense to secure the services of a first-rate
cook. It was a delight to sit at such a table, with a dozen of
youthful and beautiful faces beaming upon you. As I looked
at the head of this happy family, and saw him looking so contented

<!-- Volume I, Page 148 -->

with his lot, I could not help contrasting the father with
the broker, and wondering how he could undergo so complete a
metamorphosis, while riding in an omnibus from Twenty something
street to his office.</p>

<p>"Well, Grimshaw," said old Gil to me the next morning,
when we reached his office, "do you think you will like to live
with me?"</p>

<p>I assured him that nothing could give me greater pleasure.</p>

<p>"You see that I have got a house full of girls, and when my
married daughters come home with their husbands and children,
we have no great room to spare; but Mrs. Gilson will find a
corner for you if you are willing to stay."</p>

<p>"But, how can I serve you, to repay this kindness to me?" I
said.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself about that, Grimshaw; I told you
before that it is one of my principles not to give something for
nothing. I shall get full returns for all you cost me, and more.
My business requires a good memory, and a quiet tongue. All
you have got to do is to sit and listen, and remember what you
hear; some time or other you may be called upon to testify.
Then, you can go to the bank for me; but this morning I will
give you a different kind of commission to execute, and if you
do this well, it will lead to something better."</p>

<p>Old Gil took off his hat, which was his only strong-box, and
taking out a bundle of notes he selected some five or six bills, and
told me to find out where the makers and endorsers lived, and
ask if the signatures were genuine or not, and whether the
papers were of a business character, or merely accommodation.
He gave me the notes, and with the aid of the Directory, I found
the business residences of all whose names appeared upon them,
and made the inquiries as directed, and then sat at the old desk
and answered questions as before. I learned that my employer
was a very famous man in Wall street, and that he was known
almost universally by the name of old Gil, very few even spoke
of him in any other manner, and only strangers called him Mr.

<!-- Volume I, Page 149 -->

Gilson. I had but one cause of uneasiness, and that was fear of
being discovered by Mr. Bassett or Captain St. Hugh. The
latter, I had reason to believe, would soon leave the country, and
as for Mr. Bassett, I should not then stand much in fear of him,
as my altered looks and Quaker garb would be sure to save me
from detection. But it was my misfortune to be sorely tried
when I had been with old Gil a fortnight; I had not only ingratiated
myself with him and his whole family, but Pauline and I
had contracted an intimacy which filled me with the most
extravagant anticipation of happiness. I was every day growing
more satisfied with myself, and had kept so strict a watch
over my tongue, that I had not made the slightest deviation from
the truth, when, one day my employer reached me a note and
told me to find the endorser and see if the signature was genuine.
The endorser was Mr. Bassett! I was terribly frightened, but I
disguised my feelings as well as I could, and went out of the
office. I could not acknowledge to old Gil that I had any
objections to calling on Mr. Bassett, for that would excite his
suspicions and lead to my detection at once. I saw no other
way open for me but to take it for granted that the signature
was genuine, and tell old Gil that it was all right. Although I
determined to do this, I also determined to make amends for it by
increased candor and truthfulness in other things. So, after
being absent from the office a sufficient time, I returned, and
reaching the note to my employer, told him it was all right.
This made me exceedingly unhappy for the next twenty-four
hours, for I had no sooner told the falsehood than I began to consider
what serious consequences might flow from it, not only to
myself but to old Gil. I had never before been guilty of a
misrepresentation where the happiness of any one besides myself
was concerned. But now I had involved the interests of a
second party, and I trembled at the bare thought of the possibilities
arising from my wickedness. The note was for three
thousand dollars, and I found that my employer had advanced a
large sum upon it, on the strength of Mr. Bassett's name. What

<!-- Volume I, Page 150 -->

if it should prove a forgery? I was appalled at the thought, and
resolved to confess my fault. But it was too late; the money
had been paid, and I should be disgraced by the confession.
And now I remembered how easy it would have been for me to
have asked one of the clerks in the neighboring offices, with
whom I had scraped an acquaintance, to present the note for
me; but I had been needlessly wicked, and this thought distressed
me more than all. Indeed, in all the wrong I had ever
done, nothing grieved me more than to find that I not only
gained nothing by it, but that I might have gained more by
acting honestly. After having broken my resolution never to be
guilty of another deception, I again fortified myself by the
strictest watch over my thoughts and tongue, and grew so very
candid and truthful, that old Gil twice reproved me for my
bluntness. But I was so constantly at my desk, and showed so
little desire to be absent from his house of an evening, that he
grew very partial to me, and used to praise me for my steadiness
and sobriety, always ending his encomiums by saying that I
should yet be President of a Bank, for this seemed to be the
highest earthly position in old Gil's imagination. But my
ambition did not lead in that direction. My fancy had been filled
with very different visions than such as a bank-parlor presented.
Sitting at the head of a board of directors, and canvassing
the standing of grocers and ironmongers, did not appear half so
delightful to me as sitting on a green bank, by the side of
Pauline, or lording it over the tenants of Blackmere; for
although I could never hope to see the castle of the St. Hughs,
I could not help nursing the thought of a castle somewhere in
the air, in which I should live like a lord.</p>

<p>Pauline and her sisters soon became familiar, and I one day
heard Lizzy call me their handsome Quaker. The family of
old Gil were all pious, excepting Pauline, who was too full of
high spirits and good humor to conform to the strictness of
Presbyterian discipline; but she always took her turn in saying
grace at meals. She was pious enough for that, and lent her

<!-- Volume I, Page 151 -->

sweet voice to chaunt a hymn every night; for old Gil was
very fond of praying, and we had religious exercises nightly,
at ten o'clock. Sometimes there would be a considerable dispute
as to whose turn it was to ask a blessing upon the dinner, and
once old Gil, to settle a controversy between Lizzy and Judith,
said to me: "Come, Grimshaw, you shall decide the matter by
asking a blessing yourself, and then the girls shall begin afresh."</p>

<p>To my shame I must acknowledge, that I had never invoked a
blessing upon my dinner, and was so confused by this unexpected
call, that I blushed, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"You forgot that Walter is a Friend, father," said Pauline.</p>

<p>"Ah! and Friends don't ask blessings, unless the spirit moves.
I remember how it is; Grimshaw, you shall be excused. But
the dinner is getting cold; I will implore the Divine Aid myself
to-day, and then you shall begin again, children, from Agnes."
So, the old man cleared his throat, and invoked a blessing
upon the dinner, for Christ's sake.</p>

<p>I felt very grateful to beautiful Pauline for coming to my aid,
and I thought that she blushed when she excused me. Her
sisters were all sufficiently kind to me, but Pauline was continually
doing or saying some little thing that had a meaning
beyond the common civilities of the others. I thought so, at
least, and every day discovered some new cause for liking her
better and better. They had music every night, and the
younger children had games, and some of them read, and some
worked, or made-believe work, with Berlin wool and beads.
Dancing and cards were forbidden. Mrs. Gilson busied herself
about her affairs, and old Gil sat in his rocking-chair, nodding
over the money articles of the morning papers.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

</div>

<p>AS old Gil always carried his business papers in his hat, I had
no means of knowing either the extent of his operations, or the

<!-- Volume I, Page 152 -->

exact amount of his capital; but I discovered by accident that
he had a secret partner, who furnished him with an almost
unlimited amount of money, and shared with him in his usurious
profits. This partner was the president of a bank; I shall call
him Mr. Barton, but that was not his true name, for it is not my
intention to reveal anybody's secrets in the course of my autobiography,
besides my own. Mr. Barton being a religious man,
like old Gil, and like nearly all other treasurers since the time
of Judas, enjoyed a high reputation for sanctity of character and
financial ability, in Wall street. The manner in which he aided
my employer in his operations was very simple, and as it illustrates
in a very striking way the benefits which the modern
science of banking confers upon mankind, by promoting commerce,
I hope I shall be pardoned for explaining it, as the reputation
of no one will be hurt thereby, old Gil and Mr. Barton
both having retired from active business, and being entirely
unknown to the present Wall street generation.</p>

<p>A bank is simply a society of a few individuals, to whom the
Legislature grants the privilege of issuing little pieces of paper
as a substitute for gold and silver, on the supposition that they
have in their possession as much of the precious metals as their
bits of paper represent. The manner in which the banks put
their paper into circulation is not by purchasing goods and paying
for them in promises to pay, but by exchanging their own
paper for the paper of merchants, making the merchants pay
a certain rate of interest prescribed by the Legislature. To
exceed this rate of interest is called usury, and those who do it,
forfeit the whole amount which they loan. This exchange of
paper between the bank and the merchants is called discounting,
and it is the amount of discount taken by the bank which furnishes
the profits to its proprietors, and pays the salaries of its officers.
But, as the bank is allowed to issue no greater amount of paper
promises than it has gold and silver to redeem with, it is very
clear that there could be no profit in its business unless there
were some means by which a surplus fund could be produced.

<!-- Volume I, Page 153 -->

This fund is obtained by the voluntary deposits in the bank of
money, for safe keeping, by merchants, who expect in return, the
favor of a discount, when they need it. These merchants, who
deposit their spare funds in the bank, are called dealers, and
are supposed to have greater claims on the bank than other borrowers,
who do not deposit. It is not to be expected that a bank
would issue a greater amount of bills than it had specie to
redeem, because that would be committing a fraud upon the public;
but banks have been accused of doing so by a certain class
of mischievous writers, whose sole aim seems to be the overturning
of existing institutions. Some of these meddlesome people
direct their feeble spite towards banks, some towards the domestic
institution of the South&mdash;negro slavery&mdash;which, according to an
American statesman, is the natural production of a hot climate,
as mosquitoes and alligators are; and others are frantic in their
exertions to re-model the wise ordinances of the law. But it
fortunately happens that every institution which enables people
to live out of the labors of others, can always afford to pay for
its defense, and therefore there is no danger that any will be
abolished while they yield a fair profit to those belonging to them.
All the insinuations and charges, therefore, that have been made
against banking institutions, have had no more effect upon
these admirable contrivances, than the man&oelig;uvres of the valiant
Commodore Conner have had upon the Castle of San Juan d'Ullos.
They stand firm and immoveable, because they are profitable to
those who manage them, and the people preserve them with a kind
of superstitious feeling, as though they were conservators of the
welfare of the nation. The bank of which Mr. Barton was the
president, had been chartered by the Legislature for the express
purpose of aiding mechanics in their business, and the more fully
to carry out the design of the Legislature, the directors had
caused an elegant gilt sledge-hammer to be suspended over the
door of the banking-house, enclosed in a wreath of myrtle. But
I have been told that this laudable design of the legislators who
chartered the bank, was never seconded in any other manner,

<!-- Volume I, Page 154 -->

and that the funds of the bank, or rather of its depositors, were
used chiefly by stock-jobbers and speculators. But I know
nothing of its affairs, excepting in the dealings of its president
with old Gil. Mr. Barton was the opposite of my employer in
everything but religion and finance, and in these particulars they
were so much alike, that they never had any differences of
opinion, but seemed to understand each other's thoughts and
wishes, as if by intuition. Mr. Barton was a smooth, velvety
man, who was careful to exhibit his well-formed person to the
best advantage, by the means of scrupulous neatness, and tight-fitting
clothes. He was about fifty years old, a widower, and,
like old Gil, an elder in a Presbyterian church. He lived in a
fashionable street, and rode down to the bank every day in his
carriage, and established a reputation for financial skill and piety
by pursuing a course directly opposite to that by which his
secret partner accomplished the same ends. People said of old
Gil that he must be rich and honest, and have entire confidence
in himself, or he would not have the independence to brave the
opinions of the world by his rudeness of manners, and utter disregard
of all the proprieties of dress. In a world where so much
depends upon mere show, it was wisely thought, no man could
afford to put his fortune in jeopardy by such an experiment,
unless he felt himself entirely independent of the world; and in
respect to Mr. Barton, they thought that no man could indulge in
so expensive a manner of living and make such an aristocratic
display in Wall street, unless he knew himself to be too wealthy
to be embarrassed by the suspicion of living beyond his income.
In short, they were both supposed to be independent, because
they appeared so, and many a sloven, who was compelled to
dress himself decently, for fear of giving offence to his creditors,
looked at old Gil with envy, and longed for the time, when they,
too, could be independent, and wear a greasy old hat, while
ambitious jobbers, who were afraid of being seen in their own
carriages, lest a suspicion of extravagance should injure their
standing in Wall street, looked at Mr. Barton when they saw him

<!-- Volume I, Page 155 -->

alight at the bank door, from his elegant carriage, with admiring
wonder, and dreamed of the time when they might safely indulge
in the same pomp. Mr. Barton was mild in his manners, and
extremely polite to everybody. Time had dealt gently by him,
and he had done all in his own power to preserve himself in a
good condition. He wore a wig, which fitted his head so well,
that it seemed to have grown upon it, and his teeth would never
have been taken for other people's, but for their supernatural
whiteness and evenness. He had good eyes, which was
extremely fortunate for him, as no means have yet been discovered
for replacing old ones with new, and he might have
passed for a young man, had it not been for his double chin, and
a disposition to corpulency. Dandies are not thought to be good
business men, and it is only a real genius among merchants who
can venture to indulge in the elegancies of dress and manners
which distinguished Mr. Barton; he could, and the directors of
the bank allowed him, the management of its affairs, only going
through the formality of doing as he suggested, twice a week;
and whenever he hinted that he was growing tired of business,
and thought of travelling in Europe, or retiring to his country
seat on the Hudson, they would raise his salary a thousand
dollars to induce him to remain. Old Gil was very rarely, or
never seen in company with Mr. Barton; indeed, he did not even
keep an account at his partner's bank, but after I was taken into
his service, I was made the messenger who carried their brief
communications back and forth, and often was entrusted with
enormous sums of money. The dealers at Mr. Barton's bank
would offer their notes for discount, but the greater part of them
would be rejected by the President, on some pretense or other,
when the disappointed merchant, to save his credit, would have
recourse to old Gil, who would charge them a rate of interest
proportioned to their necessities, making those who could least
afford it pay the heaviest usury; he would then take the same
notes, and Mr. Barton would either discount them at the legal
rate of interest, or loan the amount of them at a smaller rate,

<!-- Volume I, Page 156 -->

upon condition that the money should be returned when called
for. Some of the beauties and benefits of banking may be
imagined, from the nature of these transactions, but I would by
no means wish the ignorant reader to believe that every bank-president
is a Mr. Barton, or that every old slovenly broker in Wall
street, who carries his hat full of jobbers' notes, is an old Gil, for
such is not the case. The propensity of the public to show their
penetration, by identifying the characters in professedly fictitious
works, is very common; I have even heard that a certain person
in Wall street has already been pointed out as old Gil, while
another has done me the honor to swear that the character of
Mr. Ferocious was a portrait of himself. Some ingenious
discoverer of likenesses has already named the original of Mrs.
Ruby, and friend Goodwill is said to be known to everybody.
Flattering as these testimonials are to the reality of the personages
that I have been compelled to introduce into my history,
because they had a direct influence upon my fortunes, the effect
of which has yet to be seen, it has given me no small degree of
pain to know that I am accused of wantonly exposing the private
conduct of any person to the public. I have been extremely
careful so to disguise the distinguishing peculiarities of the characters
in my little drama, that I am very sure the originals will
never be suspected. The gentleman who has done himself the
injustice to say "I am Mr. Ferocious," as well as the friends of
old Gil and Mrs. Ruby, are assured that they lie under the most
melancholy mistakes; if I thought that this solemn asseveration
was not sufficient to save me from any more unjust suspicions, I
would throw down my pen at the end of this sentence, and never
again resume it; for nothing is more painful to my feelings than
to know that I have inflicted pain upon others, and I have always
looked upon those authors who write histories of their own contemporaries
from mercenary motives, with abhorrence. Such a
person I became acquainted with while residing in the family of
old Gil, whose character shall form the only episode in my autobiography,
and the reader may skip it or not, without danger of
being greatly a loser in either case.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 157 -->

<p>One of old Gil's daughters, Lizzy, had a passion for literature,
and, greatly to the grief of her parents, she would associate with
literary people, and send her compositions to the magazines
signed with her full name, Annie Elizabeth Gilson. This gave
old Gil a good deal of uneasiness, for he classed the literati with
dancing-masters, players and artists, for all of whom he entertained
unmeasured contempt. He thought that the pen could be
put to no higher or better use, than making entries in a ledger,
unless, indeed, it were in writing sermons, and an author and a
beggar being synonymous terms, he naturally looked upon his
daughter Lizzy as a lost sheep, when he discovered the direction
of her ambition. He could tolerate music because it formed a part
of the church service, and a music-master was endurable, because
he could be made serviceable to the cause of religion, but as
for "a parcel of poets, and such kind of blackguards," he used
to say "they ought all to be sent to Sing Sing, where they could
learn an honest living."</p>

<p>Poor Lizzy took all the scoldings of her parents as good
naturedly as she could, and instead of trying to argue them out
of their prejudices, which she knew would be a hopeless task,
she used to utter her complaints to the Muse, and vent her griefs
mysteriously in a magazine. She had addressed lines to every
member of the family, and had even done me a similar favor, in
Mr. Post's Magazine, in a sonnet, To "&mdash;&mdash;" which I have
unfortunately forgotten, and cannot, therefore, furnish the reader
with a copy, but I remember that it was highly complimentary
to my truthfulness, and that I was compared to a rose with drab-colored
petals.  It was the height of Lizzy's ambition to give a
conversazione, and invite all the literati and famous artists about
town, and taking advantage of a revival of religion in the church
of which her father was an elder, gave out that she would
be at home on a certain evening, when she knew he would be
engaged at a prayer meeting. Pauline had entrusted me with
the secret, and requested me to remain at home, promising me
delightful fun with her sister's visitors, for she had hardly a

<!-- Volume I, Page 158 -->

better opinion of the literati than her father. Old Gil and his
wife went off to the prayer meeting, taking with them Nancy,
Judith, Maria and Charlotte, who were inclined to be serious;
the two youngest children, Agnes and Magdalen, were sent to
bed, Caroline and Love were at their sisters' in the next street,
and the others were bribed to silence.</p>

<p>The family library of old Gil consisted chiefly of Bibles, with
one or two Concordances, the works of Charlotte Elizabeth, the
Presbyterian Confession of Faith, Doddridge's "Rise and Progress,"
the writings of Hannah More, and the complete works of
Mrs. Sherwood, besides a collection of little books, with such
titles as "Charles Davis, or the Power of Grace," "Matilda
Brown, or the Sinner Saved by Charles Burdett," etc., etc.
These books were carefully arranged in a small bookcase in the
back parlor, but the moment that old Gil left the house, Lizzy
had them all removed, excepting only the complete works of
Mrs. Sherwood, and their places supplied with "Moore's Byron,"
"Griswold's Poets," and some bound volumes of the "Lady's
Book." The candelabras in the parlor were lighted up, a
decanter of wine borrowed from her married sister, for old
Gil would allow no fermented liquor in his house of any kind,
some other refreshments were procured, and Lizzy stood in
the middle of the room to receive her guests. Pauline and I
seated ourselves as much out of the way as possible, that we
might enjoy each other's conversation without being overheard,
as well as watch the literati without mixing among them, and soon
after they began to arrive. They were so unlike the usual
visitors at old Gil's, that they probably appeared to us more <i>outre</i>
than they would have done elsewhere. Pauline was delighted
with the opportunity of sitting by me and showing her wit by
making remarks upon the company as they entered the room.
The first who entered was an artist, whose name I have forgotten;
they called him the American Sir Martin Archer Shee,
because he had written verses and painted portraits. He was a
little man, with high-heeled boots, which pitched him forward as

<!-- Volume I, Page 159 -->

he walked; he was tightly strapped and buttoned, and he wore
his lank black hair very long, and his moustache in imitation of
Reubens. The American Shee talked but little, and so lisped his
words that we could not make out what he said. A pensive lady,
in a black silk dress, with very long curls, came next accompanied
by a learned Pole, who could speak all languages but English.
The greeting between Lizzy and this lady was very cordial, she
was the celebrated Miss Arabella Andrews, the American L. E.
L., and the "Sappho" of the magazines. Then followed a
Unitarian clergyman, and a German professor; another authoress,
in spectacles, who was called the American Joanna Bailie,
but there was nothing notable about her, except that she was
dreadfully ugly, and wore a pink gauze cap, with a large bunch
of yellow  roses.  A very pompous gentleman was next introduced
as Mr. Myrtle Pipps. Lizzy said she was happy to
have the honor of seeing the American George Paul Rainsford
James in her father's house. Mr. Pipps bowed very low, rested
his right hand inside of his outrageously fine vest, and elevating
his head a little, remarked that there was no hospitality at the
North, and that the only true article was to be found in the
Palmetto State, where the domestic institutions encouraged the
growth of a chivalric public sentiment. Two or three gentlemen
of the press came next, whose names I suppress, and then Mr.
Fitch Greenwood and his lady, the joint authors of a translation
from the Swedish. Mr. Fitch Greenwood wore spectacles, and
he looked through them as though it cost him an effort and
didn't think much of anything that he saw through them. He
spoke to nobody, but he looked at everything. Mrs. Fitch Greenwood
was a slender little body, with red eyes; she talked to
everybody, and looked at nothing. I was startled to see Mr.
Ferocious and his friend Tibbings enter next, followed by a gentleman
who was announced as the celebrated critic, Austin
Wicks, author of the "Castle of Duntriewell," a metaphysical
romance, and a psychological essay on the sensations of
shadows. Mr. Wicke entered the room like an automaton just

<!-- Volume I, Page 160 -->

set a going; he was a small man, with a very pale, small face,
which terminated at a narrow point in the place of a chin; the
shape of the lower part of his face gave to his head the appearance
of a balloon, and as he had but little hair, his forehead had
an intellectual appearance, but in that part of it which phrenologists
appropriate for the home of the moral sentiments, it was
quite flat; Pauline said, if he had any moral sentiments, they
must be somewhere else, for it was very evident that there was
no room for them there. He was small in person, his eyes were
heavy and watery, his hands small and wiry, and his motions
were like those of an automaton. He was dressed primly, and
seemed to be conscious of having on a clean shirt, as though it
were a novelty to him. Pauline was excessively amused at the
monstrously absurd air of superiority with which this little
creature carried himself, and was vexed with her sister Lizzy for
receiving him with such marked respect. But the truth was, he
had praised some of Lizzy's verses, and had talked to her about
spondees and dactyls until she thought him a miracle of learning.
He was shallow enough on almost all subjects which tend to
make a man respectable in the world, but he had committed to
memory a few pedantic terms, and contrived to pass himself off
among literary ladies, like Lizzy, for a profound critic. Mr.
Ferocious, and his follower, Mr. Tibbings, listened with open-mouthed
admiration to Wicks, and declared he was the most
profound critic of the age. There were many more notable people
dropped in during the evening, among them a native tragedian,
with a round and inexpressive countenance, a stoop in his
shoulders, and a halt in his gait; he was called, I think, the
American Kemble, for it was a peculiarity of those originals to
call themselves after some English prototype. Mr. Wicks was
the American Jeffrey, a singularly unfortunate name to apply to
the poor creature, as he had neither the learning, the wit, the respectability,
the honesty, the independence, nor a tithe part of the
talents of the great Scotch critic. But Mr. Wick called Jeffrey
a humbug, and sneered at the pretensions of everybody who

<!-- Volume I, Page 161 -->

attempted criticism, although his highest efforts in literature had
been contributions to a lady's magazine. The literati conducted
themselves with great propriety during the evening, doing
nothing worse than saying the most ill-natured things they could
utter about all their acquaintances who were not present, and
complimenting each other in the most fulsome and laughable
manner, until the refreshments were introduced, when Mr.
Wicks, having drank a glass full of wine, the little spirit that it
contained flew into his weak head, and he began to abuse all
present in such profane and scurrilous terms, that all the ladies
went into hysterics, and poor Lizzy was in great tribulation, for
fear that her father should return before he could be got out of
the house. Mr. Ferocious and Tibbings were lamenting in
dismal tones that a man of such splendid abilities should have
such an unfortunate propensity. "However," said Mr. Ferocious,
"I like it. It shows the inner life of the individual
being!"</p>

<p>"I endorse the remark of Ferocious," said Tibbings; "it is
one of the infirmities of genius; Savage used to drink, and
Byron was fond of gin. I think that an American author should
be allowed quite as much liberty as an English one, for you
know, Ferocious, this is a free country."</p>

<p>"Tibbings," said the American Jeffrey, staggering towards
that slender gentleman, "you are a fool."</p>

<p>"Don't notice him," said Mr. Ferocious; "keep cool, quiet,
sedate.  It's only a phase of his genius.  I like it.  It's original,
peculiar, American. He will bring up something fine, directly,
out of the depths of his inner existence."</p>

<p>"Ferocious!" said Mr. Wicks.</p>

<p>"Listen, ladies," said Mr. Ferocious, winking at the ladies,
who were standing aloof in terror.</p>

<p>"Ferocious," said Mr. Wicks, again, "do you know what I
think of you?"</p>

<p>"In vino veritas. What is it?" said Mr. Ferocious, smiling
complacently towards the ladies.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 162 -->

<p>"Ferocious you are an ass!" hiccupped Mr. Wicks, "a
dunce; you can't write English; I praised you once, but I am
sorry for it; I said that you were one of our greatest poets, but I
now say you are one of our greatest asses."</p>

<p>The revulsion of feeling with Mr. Ferocious and Tibbings was
so sudden, and their admiration of the critic so completely
changed to raging scorn, contempt and hatred, that the natural
language of their passions, instead of clothing itself in words,
found a more forcible expression in actions, and utterly regardless
of the presence of the ladies, they fell upon the helpless
critic, and would probably have done him a serious injury if the
tragedian and I had not jumped to his rescue and saved him
from the terrible revenge of the enraged author and his friend.
The poor wretch being entirely unconscious of his danger, immediately
began at me and the player, bestowing upon us a string
of scurrilous epithets, which must have been quite familiar to
him when he was sober, or he could not have used them so
freely. The company now broke up in great disorder, and we
took the drunken critic home to his boarding-house, and delivered
him into the hands of his wife, who thanked us meekly for the
care we had taken of her poor husband. This incident was
rather fortunate for Lizzy, as she got rid of her guests in time to
put the house in order before the return of her parents. Her
admiration for Mr. Wicks was not in the least diminished by
this scandalous occurrence; she regarded it as an eccentricity
of genius, and wrote a sonnet about it, which she published in a
weekly paper. Mr. Wicks sent her a letter, lamenting his destiny,
praising her poetical abilities, and asking for the loan of
five dollars. The kind-hearted Lizzy was so shocked at the idea
of so great a genius being in want of so trifling a sum, that she
made a collection among her friends, for a man of genius in distress,
and sent him fifty dollars, accompanied by a note so full
of tender compassion for his misfortune, and respect for his
genius, that any man possessed of the common feelings of
humanity must have valued it more than the money. But Mr.

<!-- Volume I, Page 163 -->

Wicks had no such feelings, and with a baseness that only those
can believe possible who have known him, he exhibited Lizzy's
note to some of her acquaintances, as an evidence that she had
made improper advances to him. The scandal had been very
widely circulated, before some candid friend brought it to Lizzy,
who, on hearing it, was thrown into an agony of grief and shame,
which nearly deprived her of reason. She could not call upon
her father to avenge the wrong that had been done her, but one
of her married sisters having heard of it, told it to her husband,
who sought for the cowardly slanderer, with the intention of
chastising him for his villainy. But he had become alarmed for
the consequences of his slanders, and had persuaded a good
natured physician to give him a certificate to the effect that he
was of unsound mind, and not responsible for his actions.
Having showed this to Lizzy's brother-in-law, and signed another
paper acknowledging that he had slandered her and was sorry
for it, he was allowed to escape without a personal chastisement.
But shortly after, being employed to write for a fashionable
magazine, he took an occasion, in a series of pretended biographical
sketches of literary men and women who had been so unfortunate
as to become known to him, to hold poor Lizzy up to
ridicule, by imputing to her actions of which she was never
guilty, and by misquoting from her verses. Lizzy had the good
sense to laugh at such imbecile spite, and when the poor wretch
had brought himself and his family into a starving condition by
his irregularities, she had the goodness to contribute her
quarterly allowance of pocket-money to the gatherings of some
benevolent ladies who had exerted themselves in his behalf.</p>

<p>The conduct of Wicks had a very wholesome effect on Lizzy.
It opened her eyes to the meretricious and worthless character
of a mere literateur, and cured her forever from hankering after
the transitory fame of a magazine contributor. She had seen
her verses in print, and had been traduced and criticized by a
mercenary writer, and was ever after content to remain unknown
except to those whom she loved. Her first and last literary

<!-- Volume I, Page 164 -->

<i>soiree</i> had afforded her a source of unfailing merriment, whenever
it was mentioned, and she describes with great gusto the tragical
encounter between Wicks, Tibbings and Ferocious, for the
amusement of her intimate friends. The poor creature, Wicks,
having tried a great variety of literary employments, and growing
too dishonest for anything respectable, at last fell into the
congenial occupation of writing authentic accounts of marvelous
cures for quack physicians, and having had the imprudence to
swallow some of the medicine whose virtues he had been extolling,
fell a victim to his own arts, and was buried at the expense
of the public.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

</div>

<p>NOT many days after Lizzy's literary <i>soiree</i>, Mr. Ferocious
walked into old Gil's dusty little office, accompanied by his
friend, Mr. Tibbings, and his friend Tibbings' ebony cane, for
Tibbings and his stick were as inseparable companions as
Tibbings and Ferocious, and he would as soon have thought of
cutting one as the other; and there seemed to be as much attachment
between Tibbings and his stick as between that gentleman
and his friend, for the affection was all on the side of Tibbings.
Old Gil looked very solemn as the gentleman entered, and kept
his eyes fixed upon the papers before him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said Mr. Ferocious, smiling agreeably,
while Mr. Tibbings looked on without speaking, waiting for old
Gil to look up before he smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what is it?" said old Gil, without raising his
head.</p>

<p>Mr. Tibbings' face was immediately suffused with scarlet, to
see his distinguished friend treated with so little consideration;
he said nothing, but caught hold of his mouth as if to check his
rising indignation, which he couldn't do, however, as I have said

<!-- Volume I, Page 165 -->

before, for it spread itself all over his face, which looked as
though he had suddenly broke out with St. Anthony's fire, or
scarictina.</p>

<p>"An individual of this city, occupying a distinguished position&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop there, Ferocious" said old Gil, rising from his desk and
looking down upon the distinguished gentleman, "who is the
individual you speak of?"</p>

<p>"It's a certain person, I name no names," said Mr. Ferocious,
"of the highest repute, occupying a prominent position among the
good people of this nation."</p>

<p>"And of other nations, too," said Mr. Tibbings.</p>

<p>"That's of course, a certain individual has no desire to be
known beyond the boundaries of his own nation. But this much
I will say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This much I must say, too, Ferocious, if you have anything
to say to me about any individual, you must name his name!"
said old Gil.</p>

<p>"This is most extraordinary," said Mr. Ferocious, "but, sir,
to be more precise, explicit, and to bring down my propositions
at once to the common level of mercantile intellects, I will say
that a certain author of this good land, hoping well and wishing
well, who has done some service in the cause of his country's
honor, by writing certain plays, novels, poems, essays and
romances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That certain author is yourself, Ferocious; why don't you
say so?" said old Gil, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Mr. Tibbings, who was growing excited.
"It is himself; but he is so modest that he is never willing to
hear his name mentioned."</p>

<p>"Tibbings," said a certain author, "a certain individual, I
name no names, is abundantly qualified, or ought to be, at least,
by this time, having done much, thought variously&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it, Ferocious, what of it?" growled old Gil,
hoping to bluff him off.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 166 -->

<p>"Good; I like that, myself," said a certain individual;
"prompt, exact, decided, to the purpose. Mr. Gilson, if you
have a moment's leisure, I will open to you a plan that has been
broached by certain parties, citizens of this country, by which a
large amount of money will be realized."</p>

<p>"Money!" said old Gil, "what can you want of money, Mr.
Ferocious? but, come, let me hear what you have got to say
about it."</p>

<p>"The scheme is a feasible one," chimed in Tibbings, "and
highly respectable."</p>

<p>"Sit down and be quick, Ferocious; I'm in a hurry this
morning," said old Gil, but as there was nothing to sit upon
excepting the floor, outside of the railing which divided the
office, Mr. Ferocious and his companion continued to stand as
before, and Mr. Ferocious began to unfold his gigantic scheme.</p>

<p>The countenance of Mr. Ferocious beamed with delight, while
that of his friend and follower, Mr. Tibbings, was suffused with
purple pleasure, convinced, probably, by old Gil's manner, that
the object of their call was within their grasp.</p>

<p>"I will read you all about it, sir," said Mr. Ferocious, taking
a tape-tied bundle from his coat pocket, and, unfolding it, he
began to read: "Whereas, a national literature being essential
to nerve the bold right arm of a nation's glory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There! there! there!" exclaimed old Gil, vehemently,
"stop there, Mr. Ferocious; I have heard enough of that, and
tell me at once what it is that you want."</p>

<p>Mr. Tibbings clapped his hand to his mouth and held his
breath, but Mr. Ferocious rolled up his manuscript and replaced
it in his pocket. He then began again to unfold his plans.</p>

<p>"A certain author, I shall name no names, now; it is not
necessary," said Mr. Ferocious, with more seriousness than
before, and a little less of glowing satisfaction in his countenance,
"proposes to dispose of the copyright of his various writings,
consisting of novels, plays, essays and romances, for a certain
sum, to be paid yearly, or in one amount, as the parties may

<!-- Volume I, Page 167 -->

agree; provided that a company can be formed of high-toned
lovers of their country, a national literature, and with sufficient
means, and willing to undertake to circulate a certain number of
copies of that author's works in these United States, and in the
various countries of Europe."</p>

<p>"What goal will that do me, Ferocious?" said old Gil.</p>

<p>"Deep, cool, quiet, calculating," said Mr. Ferocious, making
stabs in the air with his forefinger as he spoke; "why, sir, I did
not make this proposition to you, thinking that you were going to
get up the company, procure the signers to the stock, and do all
for nothing. The business will be a highly respectable one, to-be-sure,
and such as some men would be glad to do for no other
recompense than the honor of it. But, sir, I think I can promise,
in the name of a certain author, that you shall be the president
of the company, and receive a liberal per centage on the amount
received."</p>

<p>"I must take time to consider on this proposition, gentlemen,"
replied old Gil, "but I must say, it appears to me a very hard
plan for raising money in Wall street."</p>

<p>"It has been done in London and Paris," said Mr. Tibbings,
"and I don't see why it shouldn't be done here. I know that
LAMARTINE sold the copyright of his works to a company in
France, and there was a company formed for the purpose of
negotiating with WALTER SCOTT."</p>

<p>"Besides the entire copyright, a certain author, who, from
motives of patriotism, is induced to make this offer," said Mr.
Ferocious, "will agree, also, to place in the hands of the president,
for the use of the company, all the complimentary presents
which may be sent to the author by foreign powers, in return for
copies sent to them."</p>

<p>"I think you are too free," said Tibbings; "a diamond ring
from Victoria, or any trifling memento from the King of Prussia,
would be more valuable to you, Ferocious, than to the company."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I may promise that a certain author will show
an enlarged liberality. Perhaps it will be better, Tibbings, to
insert a clause of redemption within a certain period."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 168 -->

<p>"And do you really think this plan a good one?" said old Gil,
turning to Tibbings.</p>

<p>"I am certain of it," said he; "it would be pleasant, profitable
and honorable to all parties."</p>

<p>"Well, I must take time to consider about it, Mr. Ferocious."</p>

<p>"When shall I expect a reply?" said Mr. Ferocious.</p>

<p>"To-morrow,"  said old Gil; "but don't call here for it; I
will send Grimshaw to you."</p>

<p>"A certain individual&mdash;&mdash;" began Mr. Ferocious, but old Gil
began to button up his coat as though he was going out, and said
he couldn't hear any more then, upon which the two gentlemen
said good morning, and took themselves off.</p>

<p>"You have no idea, Grimshaw," said old Gil, as they went
out, "how these literary fellows have bothered me with their
nonsense. It's all owing to Lizzy, Grimshaw, and I wish you
could laugh her out of her foolish notions. Did you ever see
such a pair of fools as these fellows are?"</p>

<p>"Never," I replied; "but why did you not tell them what
you thought of them?"</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to get clear of them the easiest way I
could. If I had disputed with them, that little Ferocious would
have got into a passion, and abused me, and then I should have
had to put him out on to the side walk, for which he would have
brought a suit against me. The whelp is a lawyer as well as an
author, and he would have given me trouble some way, or mortified
my daughter Lizzy, by squibbing her in the newspapers,
which would annoy me more than all. You must go and see
him to-morrow, Grimshaw, and invent some excuse that will
satisfy him."</p>

<p>"O, I can't invent anything," I said, "but I will tell him
whatever you instruct me to say."</p>

<p>"Very well; then tell him that I have got no money myself,
and can't find anybody that has; and if he comes here again, put
him out of the office."</p>

<p>I anticipated a jovial laugh from Pauline in the evening, for
she was so full of good nature and merriment, that her laughter

<!-- Volume I, Page 169 -->

was easily provoked. But Pauline never smiled even when I
told her of the magnificent project of Mr. Ferocious; on the
contrary, she looked very serious, and hardly seemed conscious
that I was talking to her. I was mortified at her coldness, and
thinking that I had done something to displease her, I said: "I
see that you are offended, Pauline; what have I done that has
displeased you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Walter; you have done nothing," she said, still
averting her eyes from me.</p>

<p>"Ah! then I see that you are ill, and that pains me more&mdash;even
than if I had offended you&mdash;for I could have convinced you
that I had no design to displease you, but I cannot restore you to
health."</p>

<p>"No, I am not ill, Walter," she replied, "but I am not well.
Something has happened to me, that, I fear, will never allow me
to feel well again."</p>

<p>"You frighten me, Pauline; what can it be?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing that need frighten you, Walter; it concerns me
alone."</p>

<p>"Ah, Pauline! do not say that what gives pain to you need
not frighten me. But do not let me press my sympathy upon
you. I will say no more. I see that my presence troubles
you."</p>

<p>"No, Walter; your sympathy does not distress me. I should
be more distressed if I did not feel sure of having it. I am very
wretched, Walter, and I will tell you the cause; but no one
must know it from you."</p>

<p>"Dear Pauline!"</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Mr. Barton, Walter? O, how I dislike
him!"</p>

<p>"What! your father's friend?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter, and he would be more than my friend; but I
would soon let him know the kind of friendship he may hope for
from me, if it were not for my father, who insists that I shall
receive his attentions to me with politeness, if nothing more."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 170 -->

<p>"And will you obey your father, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"O, I cannot, Walter! I cannot! It would be base in me to
dissemble in such a case as this. Don't you think, Walter, it
would be better to tell him that I detest him, and can only
respect him by his desisting from his overtures to my Father?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Pauline; but, does your father know your
feelings?"</p>

<p>"Towards Mr. Barton? Yes. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Pauline?" I said.</p>

<p>"But, Walter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here we were interrupted by the whole family pouring into
the parlor, where Pauline and I were sitting alone for a few
minutes, a privilege which we had seldom enjoyed in that
crowded house. The remainder of the evening Pauline sat
silently at her work, and I tried to occupy my mind with a book.
But there was a film over my eyes and confusion in my thoughts;
I could neither read nor think. I remembered now that I had
lately taken two or three notes, marked private, from Mr. Barton
to old Gil, supposing that they related to some secret financial
operations. But now I could guess at the contents. Doubtless,
they contained a proposition for the hand of Pauline. Knowing
old Gil's estimation of Mr. Barton's wealth, and his anxiety to
be on good terms with him, I could readily understand his
willingness that he should become his son-in-law. But what was
of greater consequence to me, I knew now, from Pauline's confession,
that she would prefer me to the bank-president, and I
was fully assured that she would persist in her preference; but
I was afraid that if it were known to her father he would immediately
dismiss me from his employment. With my mind full of
these thoughts, and schemes for getting Pauline out of her difficulty,
and keeping myself in my place, I retired to bed.</p>

<p>After reaching the office the next morning, old Gil said to me,
"Now Grimshaw, go and see that little fellow, Ferocious, and
don't let me be bothered with him again." As there was no possibility
of avoiding this new duty, I was obliged to obey my

<!-- Volume I, Page 171 -->

employer's commands, but I had many misgivings that Mr. Ferocious
might, on closer acquaintance, recognize his former pupil.
He still occupied the same office in Pine street, where I had been
first introduced to him, and I saw sitting at the ragged desk
where I had been placed, with the writings of a certain author
before me, an unhappy-looking little wretch, with the self same
books open before him, straining his feeble eyes in endeavoring
to master their contents. "Where is Mr. Ferocious?" said I to
the little imp.</p>

<p>"He is in his private office, sir; will you please sit down, and
let me announce you, sir?" said the little imp, and, as the ceremony
of announcing me was a very brief one, I was soon ushered
into the presence of a certain author, whom I found engaged in
drawing up a plan of an association to purchase, print, publish,
circulate and advertise, the works of a certain individual.</p>

<p>He rose to greet me with a courteous smile, and said, "I forget
your name, sir."</p>

<p>Everything about the office looked so familiar, and brought to
my recollection so vividly the occurrences of the day that I had
spent in it, and Mr. Ferocious himself looked so exactly like
himself when I met him, that I was thrown completely off my
guard, and forgetting who I was, unconsciously replied to him,
"Tom Pepper!" without being aware of what I had done until
he started in surprise, and exclaimed, "Tom Pepper! So it is."</p>

<p>I attempted to correct my blunder, and immediately said, "I
mean Grimshaw."</p>

<p>But it was too late. Mr. Ferocious remembered me as soon
as he heard my name, and said: "So, Mr. Tom Pepper, you are
caught at last. Good, capital, excellent. Ha! ha! ha! Run,
Jackson, and tell Mr. Bassett to come to my office at once. Sit
down, Mr. Pepper. So, you have turned Quaker, and changed
your name to Grimshaw?  Excellent, capital, superb.  Let me
take your hand, that I may be sure you are not a ghost."</p>

<p>I was going to attempt to convince Mr. Ferocious that he was
mistaken, but it was no use. I had convicted myself, and I had
no hope of escape but in immediate flight. So, I said: "You

<!-- Volume I, Page 172 -->

are in error, Mr. Ferocious. I must return to my employer and
tell him of your strange conduct." As I attempted to pass out
of the door he caught hold of my arm and attempted to stop me,
but I threw him off and sprang out of the office, jumped down
the stairs, and hurrying into Broadway, ran until I was out of
breath. I then got into a cab, and ordered the driver to take me
into the Bowery. There I alighted, and, wandering through the
bye-streets on the east side of the town, I found myself, near the
middle of the day, among haunts of sailors and ship-carpenters,
in Cherry street. Here I felt myself secure; but here I could
not long remain. I had now more reason than ever to dread
exposure, for I could not hope to remain in favor with old Gil
and his family, after they should know of the deceptions I had
practiced towards them; and even Pauline would spurn me and
despise me. Now I began to taste the real bitterness of the
draught I had prepared for my own lips. To leave Pauline just
as I had been convinced of her love for me, was the hardest
punishment I had yet had to endure. I walked about the
remainder of the day, with my eyes filled with tears, and hardly
conscious of anything about me, until it was dark, when I entered
a cheap restaurant which was frequented by seafaring people,
and while sitting at one of the tables I heard two men talking
about a shipping office next door. As something was said about
green hands, I asked if they shipped green hands there, for the
navy. One of them, who wore a blue jacket, replied that they
didn't do anything else, and asked if I knew any likely young
fellow who wished to make a man of himself. I told him that I
might want to ship myself.</p>

<p>"Well, old Fellow," said the short jacket, "if you will take
my word for it, you couldn't do a better thing. It's the only
service in the world where a man can get his real deserts, plenty
of grog, a bit of a flogging, when he needs it, and light work.
If a man don't like that, he is no man at all. I have tried it, and
I know how it is. Good wages, tobacco and small stores, and a
toot of whiskey three times a day."</p>

<p>"You may well say that," added his companion.  "Uncle

<!-- Volume I, Page 173 -->

Sam takes good care of his sailors. Plum-pudding on Sundays,
and only one banyan day in the week. I have tried Johnny
Bull and Johnny Crapeau, but give me Uncle Sam, after all."</p>

<p>"Come, ship-mate," said the other, "take something to drink
with me, and then I will show you to the shipping agent."</p>

<p>I declined the drink, but accepted the invitation to the shipping
agent, for I saw that the best way of escaping would be by
entering on board a United States ship.  I had, in truth, always
entertained a very strong desire for a sea life, and wondered now
that I had not thought of a ship before. It so happened that one
of the men whom I encountered in the restaurant, was employed
to pick up men for the shipping office, he therefore caught
greedily at me, when he discovered that I had an inclination to
ship in the service, and related a good many stories of Uncle
Sam's good treatment of his sailors, all of which had no other
effect upon me than to convince me that my new acquaintance
had some sinister design in relating them. But I had no apprehensions
of harsh treatment from Uncle Sam, having been accustomed
to consider him the merest lump of good nature, from the
manner in which his servants spoke of him, and I believed
implicitly in the plum-puddings, in particular. The rendezvous
was kept in a dirty bar-room, where there were some drunken
sailors, and a Scotchman making a dismal noise with a bag-pipe.
My restaurant friend, who turned out to be one of that class of
servants employed by Uncle Sam, that sailors call Crimps, presented
me to a burly Dutchman, as a young fellow as wanted to
enter Uncle Sam's service, in the capacity of a green hand or
landsman.  The Dutch shipping-master gave me encouragement
to hope that I might be accepted in the morning by the lieutenant
in charge of the recruiting station, and very obligingly furnished
me with an entire suit of sailor's clothes, in part payment of
which he received those that I took off, and accommodated me with
a bed for the night. The next day, having been duly
received into the service of Uncle Sam, and the Crimp having
received, on my behalf, the advance wages to which I was

<!-- Volume I, Page 174 -->

entitled, I was put on board the Constitution frigate, lying in the
North River, and stationed in the after-guard. It was the first
time I had ever set my foot on the deck of a man-of-war, or,
indeed, of any vessel larger than the coaster in which I made
my escape from Apponagansett, and the scene was full of novelty
and excitement for me, yet it appeared to me that I had been
familiar with something like it before. I had a confused sensation
which puzzled me exceedingly, of a former state of existence,
but when or where I could not tell, in which I had known
something of a life like this. Almost every object and every
sound that I encountered, I had a feeling of having known before,
and as I walked about the decks I continually saw old faces that
had a dreamy look of recognition, which I could hardly prevail
upon myself that I had not seen before, but when the boatswain
and his mates blew their whistles, the shrill sound made my
heart leap, they sounded so familiarly in my ears. Yet, I had
never heard them before. On the poop-deck, walking to and
fro, with a telescope under his arm, and dressed in extremely
neat clothes, was a man, whose gait, face and voice were so
familiar, that I could have sworn I had seen him before, had
it not been for the strange mystification of other objects on board.
But the man on the poop soon grew into a reality that I instantly
recognized, on hearing one of the officers say to a side-boy:
"Tell Swayne to keep a sharp look out for the Captain's boat."
It was, in fact, the father of little Sylvia. I expected to see
Captain St. Hugh next; but Swayne's was the only face I saw
which I could positively identify, although the greater part of the
crew seemed like old, half-forgotten acquaintances. I strolled
about the ship's decks, gazing at the guns, and wondering at
everything, until all hands were piped to dinner, when I was
sufficiently hungry to eat my allowance of salt beef and biscuit.
I looked for the plum-pudding, but saw no indications of a second
course. The ship was crowded with men who seemed very
happy and careless, and took particular delight in abusing Uncle
Sam and his officers, which I saw not the least occasion for,

<!-- Volume I, Page 175 -->

neither Uncle Sam nor his officers appearing to care anything
about them.</p>

<p>I had shipped under the name of William Brown, for the sake
of preserving the initials on my clothes. The Dutch shipping-master
said: "That's a purser's name of course;" and when I
told the purser's clerk my name was William Brown, he made
the same remark, and told me I was William Brown the fifteenth,
there being that number of William Browns on board the ship,
and that I must answer to that name and no other. I wrote
my new name on the lining of my hat, that I might not forget
it, and get myself into trouble again as I had done by revealing
my real name to Mr. Ferocious. I had remarked a number of
young men, some of them mere lads, in short jackets and turnover
collars, in different parts of the ship, with daggers at their
sides, suspended from a glazed leather belt, and being curious to
know who they were, I asked an old sailor. "Ah, these are
some of Uncle Sam's chickens," said the old tar; "you needn't
take any pride in 'em; they ain't of any account till they got
swabs on their shoulders."</p>

<p>"But what do they do here?" said I.</p>

<p>"Do!" said the sailor; "why, they don't do anything but
sharpen the Commodore's tooth picks."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I, "is that really true?"</p>

<p>"True!" said the sailor, looking fiercely at me; "do you
mean to insinnywate anything, ship-mate?"</p>

<p>"Here comes one of them now," said I, as I saw one approaching
us.</p>

<p>"Well, don't mind anything he tells you, ship-mate, and see
if I didn't tell you the truth about him," said the old sailor, and
moved off to another part of the ship. Directly, the youngster
with the dagger at his side, came near me and said: "What are
you doing there, Johnny Raw?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing yourself?" said I in reply.

<p>The youngster stopped short, and looked at me with as much
amazement as though I had struck him.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 176 -->

<p>"You impertinent rascal!" said he, "I will teach you how to
answer your superiors. Boatswain's mate, what's this fellow's
name?" But the boatswain's mate not having learned my name,
was sent to the purser's steward, and directly returned and
informed the youngster that name was William Brown the
fifteenth.</p>

<p>Away went the enraged youth, and soon I heard a hoarse
voice bellowing out my new name at the main hatchway, and
then another voice on the deck below roared out in gruff tones&mdash;"William
Brown, the fifteenth."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" I said to the sailor who was
calling out my name. He was a giant-like man, with an immense
pair of red whiskers, and he wore a silver chain round his
neck, to which was suspended a silver whistle.</p>

<p>"Go aft to the officer of the deck," said he, "and see what is
wanted." I went as directed, and found a pale-faced young
man, wearing a sword, a pair of epaulets, and a gold laced blue
cap, standing near the poop-deck, with his arms folded, as if he
was waiting for me. "Did you want me, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Do you speak to me without touching your hat, you rascal?"
said the officer, drawing his sword.  "It is time you were taught
how to behave to your superiors. Is this the fellow who insulted
you, Mr. Paltry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the youngster whom I had offended.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said the epauletted gentleman, "I will give
him a lesson in good behavior that he won't forget while he is
in Uncle Sam's service. Go tell Mr. Grummet to call all
hands to witness punishment."</p>

<p>"To witness punishment," said I, thinking it not unlikely
that the officer was either going to reprimand me in the presence
of the ship's crew, or put a fool's-cap on my head, as a terror to
evil doers, for I perceived that I had quite unconsciously committed
a wrong act; "if I have broken any of the ship's rules,
I am sorry for it. Surely you do not mean to punish me for
committing an unconscious offence."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 177 -->

<p>"Make no back answers, you scamp," said the lieutenant, "or
I will flog the life out of you."</p>

<p>By this time there was a commotion in the ship, the crew were
gathering on the spar deck, the marines were turned up with
their muskets bayonetted, the officers came out of their cabins
with swords in their hands, all work suddenly ceased, and the
faces of the men became as solemn as though they were going
to witness an execution. I trembled with apprehension, although
I had not the most shadowy conception of what was going to be
done. But I saw from the looks of the men who came thronging
about me, that I was an object of especial interest and commiseration.
Among the rest who came was Swayne, with a couple
of small cords in his hand. I was so terrified, that I could hardly
help revealing myself to him, and claiming his protection. But
I knew what a cruel beast he was and had little to hope from
him. I was taken to the gangway, and ordered by the lieutenant
to "strip."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by stripping?" I said; "what shall I
strip?"</p>

<p>"You shall have another dozen for that, you rascal," said the
lieutenant: "quarter-master take off his shirt."</p>

<p>"Take off your shoes and shirt, my lad," one of the sailors
who stood near whispered, "and be a man; you shall have a
toot of grog as soon as it's all over. Don't flinch."</p>

<p>But as I still hesitated in spite of this encouragement, Swayne
and another man took hold of me, and began to pull off my jacket.
But I resisted them, and demanded to know what I had done deserving
of punishment.</p>

<p>"Silence, you villain, or I will run you through the body!"
exclaimed the officer, his lips livid with rage.</p>

<p>In spite of my resistance, Swayne had succeeded, with the
help of another quarter-master and the boatswain's mate, in
taking off my shirt and shoes. They then tied cords on my
ancles and wrists, and fastened my hands to bolts above my head
in the gangway, while two other men secured my feet to a wooden

<!-- Volume I, Page 178 -->

grating on the deck. I turned my head, and saw the red-whiskered
boatswain's mate standing near in his shirt sleeves, which
were rolled up above the elbow, and displayed a huge sinewy
arm that might have felled an ox; in his hand he held a short
whip-handle having nine thongs of hard twisted cord, the end of
each being rendered nearly as hard as iron, by twine tightly
wound round them to prevent their untwisting. The boatswain's
mate coolly and deliberately shook this frightful looking instrument
to disentangle the tails, and carefully separated them by
running his fingers through them, for they appeared to have
stuck together,  probably from the blood of the last victim of
Uncle Sam upon whose back they had been used, that still remained
upon them. Terrible as all these preparations were, the
fear of the lash was nothing to me, compared with the degradation
of the flogging. I thought that in leaving Capt. St. Hugh,
and in being separated from Pauline, I had experienced the severest
trials possible for me to bear. But this was something
worse than death. To be publicly flogged like a criminal, was
an ignominy that I could never recover from. I turned round
to make an appeal to the lieutenant, and saw him smiling carelessly
at something which the surgeon had said to him. My ears
were quick to catch anything like an expression of feeling or
pity, and I heard the lieutenant say in a low voice,  " 'twill do
his young flesh no harm, doctor. He will be able to show Uncle
Sam's stripes on his back for a passport, when he is in a foreign
country."</p>

<p>"Surely," said I, as he turned his face towards me, "you do
not mean to put such an indignity upon me."</p>

<p>"Silence, you scamp!" said the lieutenant in reply.</p>

<p>"Oh! I cannot be silent," I said, "I will not. I am a man
like yourself; be merciful to me: if I have broken the rules of
the ship, turn me ashore&mdash;let me go back again. But do <i>not</i>, O,
do not suffer a lash to be put upon my back. Kill me, but do
not flog me."</p>

<p>"Boatswain's mate, do your duty," replied the officer.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 179 -->

<p>"Hold, hold, but one moment," I cried, as I saw the boatswain's
mate preparing to raise his arm; "where is Mr. Swayne."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" growled, the quarter-master.</p>

<p>"Save me! save me! Swayne!" said I, thinking of nothing
now, but the indignity of the flogging, and regardless of the
consequences of revealing myself to him, "don't you know me?
I am Tom Pepper!"</p>

<p>"Avast! avast!" exclaimed the quarter-master, as the boatswain's
mate lifted his arm, "Avast! Are you Tom Pepper? I
believe you are."</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this, Swayne?" said the lieutenant;
"do you want to be made a spread eagle of yourself?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Swayne, "I can tell you something
about this young fellow, perhaps, that you don't know. He is a
gentleman's son, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" said the lieutenant; "I would flog him if he
were my brother, and I will have you there next, old fellow, if
I see you shake your head again. Go on, Harris."</p>

<p>I turned my head to make another appeal to the cruel brute,
but, before I could speak, I felt a sensation as though melted
lead had been poured upon my back. I was but flesh and blood,
and I believe that I made an outcry so dreadfully unheroic, that
some of the old tars were ashamed of me. After the first cut of
the cat, I bore it better; but the lashes were rained upon my
back to the amount of two dozen, each lash cutting into the
flesh, until the blood trickled down my sides. I screamed for
mercy, but the obdurate lieutenant only sneered at me, and
called me a booby, which inflamed my anger the more, and
made my punishment the harder to bear. The lashes fell thick
and fast, and at each stroke of the cat I thought my life
would go, the pain was so excruciating. The master at arms,
an old, superannuated marine, stood behind me, and kept a tally
of the lashes, counting slowly as they fell upon my back, and as
he pronounced "Twenty-four," the lieutenant called to the
boatswain's mate to stop. When they cut the lashings by which

<!-- Volume I, Page 180 -->

my feet and hands were fastened, I was so weak that I could
hardly support myself, and one of the crew having thrown my
shirt over my bleeding back, I was taken down to the berth-deck,
where somebody gave me some whiskey. The sailors all had a
comforting word for me; some complimenting me on the brave
manner in which I had taken the flogging, telling me that the
next time I would care nothing about it, and others congratulated
me upon being able to show Uncle Sam's stripes upon my back.
But my pride was more deeply wounded than my flesh, and I
felt ashamed to lift up my eyes and look into the faces of my
companions. The purser's steward and one of the master's
mates had a warm dispute over me, in relation to the power of an
officer to inflict more than a dozen lashes without a court
martial. The purser's steward contended that the lieutenant
had violated the Constitution, and advised me to send a memorial
to Congress and have him broke, while the master's mate maintained
that Uncle Sam gave his officers authority to inflict as
many dozens of lashes as there were stars in the national flag,
and advised me not to trouble government about the matter, but
to drink all the grog I could get, and forget my flogging as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Swayne did not come near me, and upon
inquiring why he kept away, was told that as soon as the
flogging was over he had got permission to go ashore, and had
gone off, dressed in his best togs. This intelligence alarmed
me, for I had no doubt that he had gone to inform Mr. Bassett
of my being on board the ship, and I saw no means of escape.
I dreaded detection now more than ever, since I had been disgraced
by a flogging, and began to think how I could get clear
from the ship. It was approaching evening, the hammocks
had been piped down, the crew had eaten their suppers, the
watches had been set, but Swayne had not returned. My back
was so sore that I could not lie down, and I crept up to the gun-deck,
and, resting on one of the guns, looked through the port-hole,
and perceived that the turn of the tide had brought the

<!-- Volume I, Page 181 -->

frigate much nearer to the landing place at the Battery than she
was when I came on board. It was early in the spring, and the
water was still very cold, but I determined at once to attempt to
swim ashore, if I could contrive to drop into the water unperceived.
I had swam a much greater distance often, and had not
the least fear of drowning. Unfortunately for my scheme, there
was a full moon and a clear sky, and as the sun set the moon
rose, and shone so brightly that I began to be afraid I should not
be able a effect my escape. But slipping off all my clothes
excepting my shirt and trowsers, I crept along under the shadow
of the guns, and got into the fore-chains without being observed.
The height from the water was too great to allow me to drop
overboard without being heard, for the night was perfectly calm,
and every ripple of the current was distinctly heard. But I
found a piece of rope in the chains, and fastening it to a bolt, I
lowered myself down into the water. It was almost freezing
cold, and the salt water made the sores of my back smart so that
the pain almost took away my breath. But I struck out resolutely
for the shore as soon as I had drifted clear of the ship.
The distance, however, seemed to have suddenly doubled, and I
did not feel quite so confident in my strength as I had before
dropping into the water. But I had no fears, and never looked
back to the ship, being determined to drown rather than be subjected
to the indignity of a flogging again. I had swam nearly
half the distance when my strength began to fail me, the water
was icy cold, and I was so completely chilled that I had lost all
feeling in my extremities. I could easily keep myself afloat, but
the tide running very strong prevented me from making any
head-way. Every moment I was growing weaker and weaker,
I was still but half way between the ship and the shore, and
calculating the chances of reaching the landing, I saw that they
were greatly against me. I cannot say that I was not frightened,
but I was perfectly composed, and being determined to save
myself, if possible, I struck out afresh, and tried not to think
about drowning.  A thought now flashed upon my mind, which

<!-- Volume I, Page 182 -->

had never entered it before, and gave me such a desire to preserve
my life, that for a moment I seemed to be endowed with
superhuman strength, chilled and cramped as I had been, the
blood shot through my veins, and I struck out my limbs with
desperate energy; my eyes seemed to swell out of their sockets,
and a ball of fire seemed to be floating before me. All the incidents
of my life passed like a flash of lightning before me, from
my earliest recollections to that moment; the most trifling act
and thought of my youth, things long forgotten, old sounds, old
names, and old faces, appeared to me vividly and distinctly, and
I saw how I had brought upon myself every evil that I had
suffered. But the strange thought which set my heart on fire,
and made my life sweeter than it had ever been before, was the
conviction that Captain St. Hugh was my father. As all the
events connected with my meeting him flocked before me, his
strange exclamations when I first awakened him from his nightmare,
the mysterious sympathy which he had shown for me, the
meeting between him and Mr. Bassett, and my own sensations
on board the ship, produced instant conviction in my mind.
The effect of this thought lasted but a moment, and a chilliness
succeeded, which nearly deprived me of the power to keep
myself afloat, and then came the intense agony of despair. I saw
it was impossible to reach the landing. I had become so chilled
and exhausted that it required my utmost exertion to keep my
head above water, and I had once already sunk beneath the
surface. I could hear the crew of a vessel that lay at anchor in
the river, laughing and talking, and endeavored to call for help,
but I could not raise my voice loud enough to be heard. But I
kept crying out, and hearing the plashing of oars, I discovered
that a boat was approaching me from the shore. This gave me
new life for a moment, and again I cried out as loud as I could
raise my voice, for help. The moon was shining brightly, and
I knew that the boatmen could very easily see me if they heard
my voice, and I kept crying out, but the exertion was too great
for my exhausted condition, and as the boat neared me I grew so

<!-- Volume I, Page 183 -->

faint that it was impossible for me to keep my head above the
surface, and once more I sank, but rose again, and heard a voice
calling to me to hold on and never say die.  These joyful
sounds quite overpowered me, and as the boat, rushed through
the water towards me, and as I found myself within reach of the
gunwale, there was a sudden sound of rushing waters in my ears,
I felt myself sinking&mdash;sinking&mdash;sinking&mdash;all consciousness forsook
me, and I was lost, for a while, to the world.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN I recovered my consciousness, I found myself in a carriage,
accompanied by two men, who were supporting me
between them; I was wet, cold, sore, weary and sick, and could
only groan, being quite unable to articulate a word. I was soon
taken from the carriage, and borne into a small room, where I
was put upon a soft bed, and covered with warm blankets, when
I fell asleep and dreamed pleasant dreams, and, waking, heard a
soft and well-remembered voice say: "Call your father, Sylvia,
the young man is moving."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and looked about me, and soon discovered
Swayne, in his quarter-master's dress, standing by my bed side,
with a light in his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, matey," said Swayne, "how do you find yourself
now? Is all the salt water out of your mouth?"</p>

<p>"I am well, now," I replied; "but how came I here?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said Swayne; "lie still until you get
better, and then you shall know all about it."</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Swayne?" I said.</p>

<p>"Know you!" said he, holding the light to my face, and then
ripping out one of his accustomed oaths, he exclaimed: "Sylvia,
come here; I am a horse marine, if the young fellow we fished
out of the river ain't Tom Pepper!"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 184 -->

<p>"Why, Swine! why, Swine!" cried Sylvia's mother, rushing
to the bed side, followed by her beautiful daughter, who stood at
a distance, while she, looking me in the face for a moment, cried
out: "It is! it is! It is Master Thomas, Sylvia!" and then put
her arms around my neck and kissed me, until her husband told
her to "mind her eye." Sylvia had the tenderness to burst into
tears, which so affected me that I could not refrain from crying
myself.</p>

<p>"Come, come," says Swayne, "just belay that kind of work.
The young fellow has had salt water enough already. Keep a
sharp look out for him while I go and call Mr. Bassett."</p>

<p>As soon as Swayne had left the room, good Mrs. Swayne
renewed her embraces, and Sylvia again let fall some tears.</p>

<p>I could get nothing out of Mrs. Swayne but hugs and kisses,
and exclamations of, "O, Master Thomas! how you have
grown!" and, "O, Master Thomas! where have you been?
And how lucky it was that Swine and Mr. Bassett saved you
from a watery death!"</p>

<p>The good creature did not confine herself, however, to such
evidences of her affection, but brought me some warm spiced
wine, a little of which I drank to gratify her; and I then learned
that Swayne had failed in business, and having thought to mend
matters by taking to the bottle, finally reduced himself so low
that he was compelled to ship on board of Uncle Sam's ships,
where he was promoted to the rank of quarter-master, he having
once been chief mate of a liner; and his wife and Sylvia lived
very happily without him, partly by their own industry, and
partly by the half pay that he allowed them.</p>

<p>It was not long before the quarter-master returned, bringing
Mr. Bassett and his wife with him, at the sight of whom I would
very gladly have sunk through the bed on which I lay, and
become suddenly extinct. But all possible means of escape
were now denied me, and, seeing that I must meet my old benefactor
face to face and confess all my wrong doings, I resolved
to meet him as frankly and cheerfully as I could. As he

<!-- Volume I, Page 185 -->

approached the bed side I sat up and held out my hand to him,
which he pressed warmly, and looking kindly upon me said:
"Ah, Tom! Tom! what a wanderer you have been!"</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me? Will you love me again?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, my poor boy, I will forgive you, for you have done me
no wrong. But how can you ever forgive yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am sure, now," said Mrs. Swayne, "Master Thomas has
never done anythink wrong; and as for the cruel lieutenant,
Swine says he shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! Belay that!" said Swayne.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bassett came up to the bed side, and giving me a disdainful
look, merely said "Humph!" By which she meant, "So,
you have been caught at last, and flogged too: well, I dare say
you deserved it."</p>

<p>"Poor Tom!, poor Tom!" again ejaculated Mr. Bassett, and
seating himself upon my bed, he looked fondly and kindly into
my face, and said he had something important to tell me, which
he would not reveal to me then, as it was getting late, and I
must want rest. And then pressing my hand again, and telling
Mrs. Swayne to take good care of me, he bade me good night,
and said he would see me again in the morning. I was
impatient to know what he had to tell me, and could not rest for
thinking about it. Mrs. Swayne would tell me nothing, and her
husband having gone to sleep in another room, I lay until morning
thinking about Captain St. Hugh, Pauline, and my future
course of life.</p>

<p>In the morning Mr. Bassett came as he had promised, and
much earlier than I had expected him. But still he refused to
tell me anything, until I had been removed to a boarding house
which he had provided for me. As I was entirely destitute of
clothes, excepting a shirt and pair of trowsers, he sent me a full
wardrobe, and when I had dressed myself, took me in a carriage
to the rooms which he had engaged for my accommodations, and
when we were alone together, he made me repeat to him all
my adventures since we had parted. And then he learned for

<!-- Volume I, Page 186 -->

the first time, the cause of my leaving the book-keeper's house, at
which he was very indignant.  Having heard me to the close,
patiently, for I gave him a faithful account of all my adventures,
he said:</p>

<p>"You now see, Tom, some of the consequences of falsehood.
But you have yet to learn all the consequences to yourself and
others of your own deviation from the truth.  But first, let me
tell you the end of my wicked book-keeper, that you may see
how dangerous it is to injure another by misrepresentations, and
how every wrong act will receive its reward.  That foolish man
having been induced by some one inimical to yourself to invent
so ridiculous a plan for getting rid of you, would have been
immediately detected and exposed, had it not been for your own
want of truthfulness; he remained in my service until it was
discovered that you were living with Captain St. Hugh, when,
fearful of the consequences of his villainy being exposed, he suddenly
left the city, causing the suspicion that he had committed
some undiscovered fraud, and being reduced to extreme poverty
in a neighboring city, where he had been seeking employment
committed a petty theft, for which he was thrown into prison, and
there died."</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" I replied, in all sincerity, "I need no proofs
of the folly of violating the truth. And if I had experienced no
other evils, the forfeiture of your good will, and the loss of your
society and example, which I have suffered, would be enough."</p>

<p>"Poor Tom!" said Mr. Bassett, "if you have met with no
greater loss, you will prove fortunate. But let me tell you what
has happened, and the loss you have sustained without knowing
it."</p>

<p>"You know Captain St. Hugh," said he, and at the bare
mention of his name my heart swelled as though it would burst,
"and have had good opportunities of becoming acquainted
with the character of that noble-minded gentleman."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, "I knew him and loved him, too."</p>

<p>"It is well that you loved him, Tom, for you know not how

<!-- Volume I, Page 187 -->

well he loved you, nor how he has bewailed your loss, nor what
cause you had to love him."</p>

<p>"And did he love me?" said I.</p>

<p>"Listen to me patiently and you shall know. I will tell
you his story, as he told it to me."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

</div>

<p>"CAPTAIN ST. HUGH," said Mr. Bassett, drawing his chair by
my side, "was the youngest of three brothers; their father was an
Admiral in the British Navy, who died, leaving them, in their
childhood, to the protection of their uncle, a baronet in Lancashire,
whose name was Eustace St. Hugh. The two elder
brothers were put into the army, while the younger, who resembled
his father, and had a predilection for the sea, was put into
the navy, where he distinguished himself by his bravery in
several engagements with the French, and just previous to the
close of the last war between England and America, he was
ordered on board the frigate Endymion, which, soon after he
joined her, formed one of the blockading squadron in Long
Island Sound. During a cruise of the frigate in Buzzard's Bay,
he once went ashore, accompanied by some of his young companions,
and the chaplain of the ship, and while frolicking at a
farm house, he became enamored of one of the farmer's
daughters, and prevailed upon the chaplain to marry them, in
sport. When the time came for the frolicking officers to return
to the ship, young St. Hugh discovered that he had, in the little
time that he had been on shore, more than gained the love of an
innocent girl, whom he could never expect to see again. He
had, in truth, become the husband of a woman, in jest, but found,
on leaving her, that in her simplicity she believed herself married
in earnest. His companions laughed at him, and he laughed
at himself, but being possessed of honorable feelings, he secretly

<!-- Volume I, Page 188 -->

reproached himself for his thoughtless conduct, and could not
drive from his thoughts the parting words and lovely looks of
the innocent creature whom he had wronged. Time passed on,
he was constantly in active service, and was soon promoted to a
captaincy for his gallant conduct. He unavoidably mingled
with gay company, visited all the maritime countries of the
world, was courted and caressed wherever he went, but he could
never forget the innocent beauty of Buzzard's Bay. She
haunted him in his dreams, and in his waking moments was
ever present to his thoughts. So lightly did he think of his pretended
marriage with her, that he had not even inquired her
name on leaving her. He remembered that her companions had
called her Patty, and that was all he knew about her. But her
looks, the tones of her voice, and her innocent grief on parting
with him, were all fixed indelibly in his memory. He strove to
forget them, and endeavored, by forming new attachments, to
efface the impression she had made upon his heart. But all was
in vain. The older he grew, the more vividly would her image
appear before him, until at last she so completely occupied his
thoughts, and obtained such entire control of his affections, that
he shunned all society, and was never happy excepting when
alone with the phantom that haunted him. Society having no
charms for him, he sought for constant service at sea, where he
could indulge in his solitary moods, and sometimes find a temporary
relief from his thoughts, in the excitement of a storm.
Returning home after a cruise round the world in his favorite
frigate, the same Endymion which had witnessed his boyish frolics,
he found himself, in consequence of the death of his
two brothers and his uncle, the possessor of the estates and the
title of the  St. Hughs. He was the last male representative of
his ancient family, and at his death the name would
become extinct, and the estates would fall into the possession
of a very remote branch of the family. He spent a year at the
castle, of which he was now the lord, endeavoring in vain to
drive from his imagination the image of the poor girl, whose

<!-- Volume I, Page 189 -->

confidence he betrayed. He had never entrusted his secret to a
living soul, but the chaplain who had performed the ceremony
of marriage having become old, sedate, and the rector of a parish
church not far from his estate, he called upon his former wild
companion, and making known his case, asked the advice of the
now dignified clergyman. The chaplain, thinking, perhaps, that
it was an idle whim of Captain St. Hugh, and naturally believing
that a sight of the woman whose idea haunted him would immediately
dispel all his fondness and remorseful feelings, advised
him to make a journey to America for the purpose of finding her,
and if he should succeed, to ease his feelings by making her
such a recompense as would satisfy his conscience. The
chaplain, at the same time, told him he was not sure but that the
marriage was strictly legal, and warned him against the consequences
of making himself known to his wife, who might possibly
be married to one of her own countrymen, and in her own
condition. Captain St. Hugh was well pleased with the
chaplain's advice, and having arranged his affairs in a short
time, embarked at Liverpool for America, and on his arrival
here proceeded immediately to Buzzard's Bay, in search of the
woman whom he now believed to be his lawful wife. As he did
not even know her name, and there had been many changes in
the neighborhood, he had great difficulty in learning anything
respecting her. To his sorrow, however, he discovered, after a
painful search, that his wife had died, broken-hearted, leaving a
boy, of whom he was the father. But nobody could give him
any intelligence of his son. He was well remembered by some
of the inhabitants, who gave a glowing account of his sprightliness
and beauty.  But he having disappeared suddenly, one day,
it was supposed that he was drowned. This intelligence only
added to the melancholy of Captain St. Hugh.  He offered
extravagantly large rewards for any positive intelligence in relation
to his son, and spent an entire year in the neighborhood, but
without being able to gain the slightest clue to his fate. The
family with whom the boy lived after the death of his grandparents,

<!-- Volume I, Page 190 -->

were also dead, and it was only known that he had suddenly
disappeared from the village.</p>

<p>"What had become of this boy nobody could tell. He was
remembered as a careless, happy lad, who, having no guardian,
was allowed to play where he pleased, and as he was addicted to
diving and fishing from the rocks, they supposed he had been
drowned, and he would have been forgotten but for the inquiries
of his father. Although there was no reason to believe he was
living, or, if living, that he could ever be found, as it was so
long since he had been seen, yet Captain St. Hugh would not
give up the idea of finding him. Having no attachments to
draw him back to England, he resolved to remain in America
until he should receive some tidings of his son. He remained in
Apponagansett long enough to superintend the erection of a
simple marble tomb, over the remains of the woman whose death
he had caused, and having generously rewarded the poor people
who had given shelter to his son, he left the little village, uncertain
in what direction to turn. Thinking it probable that the
boy, if alive, would instinctively prefer a sea-life, he travelled
from port to port, making search wherever he went, and offering
rewards for any intelligence of his lost son. The fancied image
of his child haunted him in his sleep, and filled his thoughts in
his waking hours. He wandered from city to city, and from
port to port, regardless of everything that he saw, and heeding
neither man nor woman, but watching with intense scrutiny, and
questioning every boy that he encountered of the apparent age
or fancied appearance of his son. Many a time did his heart
leap in his breast at the sight of some curly-headed, bright-eyed
youth in a sailor's dress, in whose face he fancied that he recognized
a resemblance to his own family features. But he was
always doomed to disappointment. His unfruitful search never
wearied him, or weakened his conviction that he should some day
discover his child; but his intense anxiety, and incessant application
to one sole pursuit, and lack of sympathizing friends, had
brought on a melancholy habit, which was mistaken by some for

<!-- Volume I, Page 191 -->

insanity, and by others for misanthropy. However, those who
knew him intimately, testified to the kindness of his heart, and the
perfect sanity of his mind, unless the wild hope he cherished of
some day seeing his son, might be considered evidence to the
contrary. In this frame of mind he continued his pursuit,
without ever gaining the slightest thread to guide him, and yet
without his hopes being in the least degree weakened. It
was a strange infatuation, for which he could not account, for he
received no encouragement from anybody, and many tried, by
various means, to divert him from his purpose. But it was a
religious duty, which he fulfilled as an atonement for his error,
and he could not be turned from his course. Returning, one
night to his hotel in New York, after having performed his customary
task, he retired to bed more weary than usual, and being
distracted in his sleep by a frightful dream, he suddenly awoke
and saw standing by his bed the exact image of the boy that had
so often appeared to him in his dreams. Amazed at the apparition
he made some exclamation, when it suddenly disappeared.
He thought that it was nothing but a hallucination of his fancy,
and again fell asleep; but, in the morning, finding from the
appearance of his room that there had actually been a visitor in
it, he made inquiries, and, to his surprise and delight, he learned
that a lad, the description of whom answered to the apparition of
his bed side, had slept in the chamber adjoining his own, the
night before. This gave him new hopes and he determined not
to leave the city until some intelligence was had of the boy,
whom be fondly believed was his lost child.  Months and months
were passed in fruitless enquiries and wearisome expectations,
when the long-sought boy was suddenly brought to him, just at a
time when he had abandoned all hope of ever seeing him again.
But the boy proved not to be his. His name was different; there
was no similarity in the manner of his birth or fortune, and
even his age did not correspond with that of his son's. But then,
he bore a surprising resemblance to the St. Hugh family, and the
fond-hearted Captain, having so long sought for an object to

<!-- Volume I, Page 192 -->

lavish his affections upon, and finding this boy destitute of a
home, resolved to adopt him, and if he should never find his own
son, to make him the inheritor of such parts of his estate as he
had a right to bequeath. You know how fondly he loved him,
and how generously he behaved towards him."</p>

<p>I had not listened thus far without interrupting Mr. Bassett,
for I was wild with joy, not unmingled with grief and shame;
but here I fell upon my knees before him, and begging his forgiveness,
besought him to let me go without delay in search of
my father.</p>

<p>"Your father, Tom?" said Mr. Bassett; "how do you know
that you have a father?"</p>

<p>"O! I know that I have; I know it now; do not keep me
longer in misery!" I said.</p>

<p>"Patience, my boy," said Mr. Bassett, with a coldness that
frightened me, "be patient, and you shall know all. Let us
leave Captain St. Hugh for a while, and go back to the time of
our last parting, to the sudden termination of your apprenticeship
to Mr. Ferocious. I need not tell you, Tom, that jealousy is one
of my wife's infirmities. You have seen too many proofs of it.
But as it springs from her excessive fondness for me, I could
never censure her for it, although it has been the cause of much
unhappiness to me. So jealous is she of engrossing my entire
affections, that it makes her unhappy if I show a liking even for
an inanimate object. When she found that I put you to board
with my bookkeeper, she bribed the wife of that weak-minded man
to turn you out of doors, which she did, and by the singular
accident that immediately placed you in Captain St. Hugh's
hands, I lost all trace of you, and believed that you had either
been murdered, or that you had run away and gone to sea. But
a year or two after this event, I made another journey to Boston,
on business, and remembering the benefit to my health from
having returned in a packet through the Sound, I determined to
try it again. It so happened that the vessel in which I took
passage was obliged to make a harbor, on account of a storm,

<!-- Volume I, Page 193 -->

and the captain, at my suggestion, came to anchor in the little
harbor of Apponagansett; I had a curiosity to know something
about your family, and thought I might there get some intelligence
of you. You may judge of my gratification and astonishment to
learn that you had been sought for by your supposed father, who
had family honors and wealth to bestow upon you, and on my
return to New York, I caused an advertisement to be published in
all the papers, offering a reward to any one who would give any
intelligence of you. This advertisement having been seen by
Captain St. Hugh, he immediately sought an interview with me,
and was at once convinced, from my description of your person,
that the boy whom he was educating, and upon whom he
had, in a moment of enthusiasm, bestowed his family name, was
his long sought son. Great as his joy at this discovery was,
Tom, it was not greater than my own; for I had loved you, and
it gave me inexpressible delight to witness the overwhelming joy
of Captain St. Hugh. Yet, Tom, our pleasure was greatly
marred by the recollection of your inexplicable falsehoods in respect
to your name, and the place of your birth. It grieved Captain
St. Hugh, and it mortified me, to find that all my lessons had
been wasted upon you. We were puzzled to divine your
motives for such monstrous deceptions, and for my own part, I
had no trifling curiosity to know the causes of your abandoning
me, whom you had always appeared to love. Captain St. Hugh
hardly waited for me to satisfy him that his protege and mine
were the same person, so impatient was he to see you again,
when he mounted his horse and insisted on my accompanying
him to his house and witnessing his meeting with his son. I had
no disposition to refuse, and followed him in a gig. It was late
in the afternoon when we got to his house, and we had the mortification
of finding that you had gone to ride on your pony. So he
showed me the portrait of his ancestor, Sir Eustace, whose
name he had bestowed upon you, and whom he fancied you
resembled. I saw the resemblance, myself, and all doubt of
your being the son of Captain St. Hugh, vanished. The Captain

<!-- Volume I, Page 194 -->

was so impatient that he made the gardener mount his horse and
go in search of you.  It grew dark, and he began to be alarmed
at your absence. By and bye, the gardener returned and
reported that he had not been able to find you. You had never
staid so late before when you rode out on your pony, and the
alarm of the Captain grew to such a height, that I began to fear
some dangerous consequences to him. Hour succeeded hour,
and you did not come; the night was dark, carriages and horsemen
had disappeared from the road, and all was quiet and still.
We watched at the gate, and listened with intense anxiety for the
sound of horses' hoofs, but heard none approaching the house.
The Captain at last became so nervous, that he proposed summoning
the neighbors and requesting them to aid in searching
for you. As Captain St. Hugh had shunned any communication
with his neighbors, they were not very favorably disposed towards
him, and when they heard that he wanted them to go in a search
of a boy who was old enough to take care of himself, nearly all
refused. But there were two who said they would do anything
in their power to relieve his apprehensions. Five of us,
including the gardener, mounted our horses, and each one
having a torch in his hand, we set out in search of the vagrant
boy. The whole night was spent on the road, and towards
morning we returned to Captain St. Hugh's house, the Captain
being hardly a remove from insanity. All the next day and the
next night were spent by the Captain and his gardener in seeking
for this long-sought boy, who seemed to have such a remarkable
talent for getting lost just at the moment when it was most essential
to his own happiness, and that of others, that he should be on
hand. Poor Captain St. Hugh was nearly distracted; he could
neither sleep nor eat, but ran about asking all whom he met if
they had seen his boy. What amazed him, and me, too, was
your strange perversity in concealing your true name, and representing
yourself as a native of Boston. But this did not, in the
least degree, diminish his love for you, which was ardent before,
but now that he knew you to be his son, was so strong as to

<!-- Volume I, Page 195 -->

overpower all other feelings. The police of the city having been
incited by large rewards your recovery, found your pony at
the livery stable, where you had left him, and shortly afterwards
your clothes and ring, in the possession of a woman of doubtful
fame. The account which she gave of the manner in which she
became possessed of them, being contradictory, and in the
highest degree improbable, she was arrested on suspicion of
being concerned in your murder, and now lies in prison awaiting
her trial. And here all attempts to recover you ceased."</p>

<p>"But, Captain St. Hugh!" said I, "where is he?"</p>

<p>"Alas! Tom!" said Mr. Bassett, in a solemn manner, "I cannot
tell. Before the discovery of your clothes and ring, he
dreamed that you came to his bed side with a pale and bloody
countenance, and looked upon him and seemed to reproach him.
This dream, which was the natural effect of his waking thoughts,
convinced him that you were murdered. So strong was the conviction,
that he immediately gave up all hope of ever seeing you
again. He became melancholy and dispirited, avoided all
society, and either shut himself in his room, or took solitary walks
at night. The discovery of your clothes removed all doubt
from his mind, if he had any before, that you were murdered,
and he put on mourning, and spoke of you as one among
dead. Every expedient was resorted to compel the woman
suspected of being accessory to your death, to confess her accomplices,
or to give some information respecting you, but while she
acknowledged the crime of having robbed you, she persisted
in saying that she knew not what had become of you but believed
you were still alive. But, if he be alive, Captain St. Hugh
would say, why does he not return to me? To this I could
make no reply; but still I believed that you were alive. I could
not impart my belief to Captain St. Hugh, who would listen to
no persuasions, but gave himself up to remorseful grief, and
reproached himself with having caused the death of his son. His
residence at Bloomingdale having become hateful to him, he
took lodgings in the city, which he seldom left, except at night;

<!-- Volume I, Page 196 -->

the friends who had become acquainted with him, exerted themselves
to cheer his spirits, but without effect, and finding that
any allusion to the subject of his grief did but increase his
melancholy, they refrained from naming you in his presence.
The time arrived for the trial of the woman who had been arrested
on suspicion of having made way with you, Captain St. Hugh
was called for to identify your ring and clothes, when, to our
consternation, he could not be found. He had suddenly disappeared
from his lodgings, leaving his travelling trunks behind
him, and up to this hour has not since been heard of. His
strange disappearance just at the moment when his evidence was
required to convict your supposed murderer, caused a suspicion
that he had also been murdered by the confederates of the woman
to prevent their exposure. But your recovery removes that suspicion,
and gives me reason to hope that the unhappy gentleman
will yet be heard from, and that you may yet be blessed by
meeting your father.</p>

<p>"So, Tom, you now see the evil that you have brought upon
yourself, and the pain you have caused to others, by forgetting
those important precepts which I had endeavored to fix in your
mind. But I will not reproach you; as the fault was your own,
so is the punishment.  It may be too late to retrieve what you
have lost by your untruthfulness, but you are yet a youth, you
have good health, the world is open to you, and if you should
never again hear of your father, nor be able to establish your
right to his estate and title, you have only to be perfectly truthful
for the future, and you may gain a fortune and be happy."</p>

<p>I could make no reply to Mr. Bassett when he ceased speaking.
I could not even raise my eyes and look him in the face, or thank
him for his repeated acts of kindness to me, which I had so little
deserved. He saw my embarrassment, and probably fancying
the condition of my feelings, took me kindly by the hand, and
said: "Do not distress yourself, my poor boy; you may still
depend upon me as a friend. I will leave you to your own
reflections a while, but when I see you again you must be prepared

<!-- Volume I, Page 197 -->

to act whatever part you may be required to fill hereafter.
Good bye, Tom; good bye;" and, after pressing my hand, he
withdrew, and left me, as he said, to my own reflections. But I
was so entirely overwhelmed with grief and shame, that I could
not reflect upon my condition, or form any plans for my future
conduct.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN the first delirium of my feelings had passed away, after
parting with Mr. Bassett, I began to look about me, and found
that I was the occupant of a handsomely furnished room,
looking out upon Hudson Square. It was a bright cheerful
day, the trees in the Park were clothed in their most
beautiful foliage, and birds were chirping and trilling among
their tender branches, exulting in their new life and unrestrained
freedom. Through a narrow lane on the opposite side of the
Park, I could just catch a glimpse of the river, which sparkled
in the sun, and looked as blue as though it were a stream of
lapis-lazuli. I felt a twinge in my still sore back, as I looked at
the river, and remembered how treacherously it had served me
the night before; but still the bright aspect of everything out
of doors had an enlivening influence upon my spirits, and I felt a
strong desire to be again at liberty, and I turned from the window
that my thoughts might not be diverted from my present condition.
I had now to anticipate the mortification of having all my
different deceptions and falsehoods exposed, and of being despised
and spurned by all the people for whom I felt any reverence or
love; but nothing troubled me more than the thought of being
rejected by Pauline, who, I feared, after my disappearance from
her father's house, might be prevailed upon to listen to the propositions
of her father's secret partner&mdash;the bank-president. As
to old Gil himself, I knew that the prospect of my one day being

<!-- Volume I, Page 198 -->

a man of wealth would atone for all the falsehoods I had told
him, and, perhaps, make me an acceptable suitor for the hand
of his daughter, but being a close calculator, he might think
that the present wealth of Mr. Barton was more desirable than my
prospective inheritance. These and a thousand other thoughts
kept my mind busy; but after a while I began to grow weary,
and wish for the return of Mr. Bassett, that I might devise some
scheme for seeking my father; but the day wore away, and he
did not return. The people of the house had sent me my dinner,
but I had had no communication with any one, and as the sun
went down I began to feel impatient, and had half resolved upon
going out in quest of Mr. Bassett, when a note was brought to
me from him, cautioning me against leaving my room, and
informing me that important business, in which I was personally
interested, would prevent him from visiting me before the next
day. This message only served to increase my uneasiness, and
I was more than ever anxious to know what detained him. But
I had no choice but to obey his commands. I saw how I had
erred in neglecting his advice, and now resolved that I would
never again forget his precepts, or in any manner be guilty of
the least equivocation or falsehood. While I sat pondering on
the consequences of concealing the truth, and the evils and
dangers of falsehood, there was a tap at the door, and on opening
it I found a little girl, who said her mamma sent her compliments,
and would be happy of my company to a little dance in
the drawing-room. I was at first going to decline and plead
illness, but my resolution to be perfectly truthful in the smallest
matters occurred to me, and as I now felt quite well, and had no
aversion to company, and had, besides, a curiosity to know what
kind of people they were with whom I was making my home, I
kissed the child for her kindness, and followed her down stairs
into the drawing-room, where I found two or three young ladies,
an elderly one, and three or four gentlemen. The old lady rose
as I entered and calling me Mr. St. Hugh, introduced me as her
new boarder, to the company.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 199 -->

<p>I noticed a slender gentleman, who was turning over the
leaves of a music book open before one of the ladies who was
seated at the piano, but I did not see his face until I had been
some time in the room. The elderly lady, who was the mistress
of the house, presently spoke to the gentleman, and said:
"Lieutenant Minton, allow me the pleasure of making you
acquainted with Mr. St. Hugh."</p>

<p>As the gentleman turned his head to speak to me, he said:</p>

<p>"St. Hugh, St. Hugh; I am happy to see you, Mr. St.
Hugh;" and I recognized instantly the officer of the ship who
had caused me to be flogged the day before.</p>

<p>I blushed and bowed, and hoped that he would not recognize
me. But he looked puzzled, and said:</p>

<p>"Your name is not familiar to me, Mr. St. Hugh, but your
face is. Surely, I have met you before. Do you recollect seeing
me ever?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" I replied, clenching my first, "I remember you well,
and you shall remember me hereafter!"</p>

<p>Pale as the wretch was before, he grew paler as I spoke, and
starting back, exclaimed: "Explain yourself!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden rush towards me by the other gentlemen
in the drawing-room, but I struggled past them, and before they
could prevent me struck the dastardly wretch a blow in the face
which knocked him over an ottoman into the lap of the frightened
old lady. Then turning to the other ladies, I begged their pardon,
and as the lieutenant gathered himself up, and made an effort
to come at me, I said to him:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I am on even terms with you. My name is St.
Hugh, but I am the poor boy whom you yesterday inflicted an
ignominious punishment upon, believing him to be friendless and
unable to protect himself, as he then was. My name was then
William Brown, and poor as it was, I had to share it with fourteen
others.  Now it is Eustace St. Hugh, and I am at least
your equal, but I am no better than I was yesterday. Let this
teach you, hereafter, to respect a man for his manhood, and not
for the clothes he may chance to have on his back."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 200 -->

<p>The ladies and the gentlemen now stood aside, and left me face to
face with the trembling lieutenant, who grinned at me, and swore
he would be revenged upon me, but he made no attempt to strike
me, and shaking his head at me, suddenly left the room. As
soon as he was gone, I explained to the ladies and gentlemen the
cause of my assault upon him, and they all applauded me for
what I had done; except the mistress of the house, who went into
hysterics, and declared that the character of her establishment
would be ruined forever, and that she could never again be able
to obtain another naval officer for a boarder. One of the gentlemen
endeavored to quiet her by reminding her that the loss of the
lieutenant's patronage would be a real benefit to her, as he was
then in her debt nearly a quarter's pay, and that he probably
had an intention of paying her with the fore-top sail sheet.</p>

<p>"But as for you, Mr. St. Hugh," said the gentleman, turning
to me, "let me advise you to beware of him. Cowards are
always revengeful, and you may anticipate an attack from him
in some way that will not expose himself to danger."</p>

<p>I affected to be under no apprehensions, and said that I should
always be prepared to meet him or any other person who treated
me dishonorably; for I now felt that I had a name to support,
and if I was entitled to be called St. Hugh, I was resolved that
no act of mine should sully that honored name. The old lady
being in a degree restored to her former equanimity, I begged
the ladies not to let my slight difficulty interfere with their
intended dance. Presently, two more boarders came in, and
there being enough to form a cotillion, one of them volunteered
to play on the piano, and the remainder of the evening was spent
in dancing.</p>

<p>My landlady's name as Nicely; she was the widow of a
bankrupt merchant, and a very grand person, who loved to make
the most of everything. She wore an immense turban, with a
cornelian brooch in front, large bunches of curls, that had
grown on a less genteel head, and every other article calculated
to give an air of majesty and gentility to her person. She called
her house an "establishment," and her boarders members of her

<!-- Volume I, Page 201 -->

family. She knew the names of all the rich people in the city,
and talked a good deal about Europe. In fact, her establishment
was conducted on the "European plan," and silver forks
and finger-glasses were things of course. Some English traveler
having said that the Americans were fast eaters, she had
drilled her boarders up to what she thought a high point
of European slowness at their meals, compelling them, by her
management of the courses, to sit at least two hours every day
at the dinner table. As she admitted no one into her establishment
but the most unexceptionably genteel people, it was considered
something of an honor to be one of her family. Her
boarders were chiefly merchants and their wives, but she had,
besides, a bank notary and his lady, a lawyer, an editor, and
Lieutenant Minton. This naval officer, when not on duty, spent
all his time on shore, and being one of those patriots who enter
the public service to save themselves the trouble of working for
a living, he always put on plain clothes when on shore, and
boarded with Mrs. Nicely because her establishment was select
and genteel, and he thought it more honorable to pass for a
private gentleman than a public servant. All these particulars,
and a good many more in respect to the establishment of Mrs.
Nicely and her boarders, I learned from Mr. Hopton, the notary,
who, being very much gratified at my manner of treating the
lieutenant, with whom he had had a quarrel, invited me into his
room to smoke a cigar and drink a bottle of wine. The notary's
wife very obligingly gave me the private histories of all the other
ladies in the house, who, I learned from her, were all most
frightfully addicted to scandal, and would trouble themselves
about other people's business, and neglect their own. Such conduct
Mrs. Hopton could not bear, and she thought of leaving the
establishment and going into housekeeping, it was so dreadful
living in a house with people who would tattle and talk about
their neighbors.</p>

<p>"And then," said Mrs. Hopton, "it is so disagreeable to live
with people who are not professors of religion. If you will

<!-- Volume I, Page 202 -->

believe me, Mr. St. Hugh, I and my husband are the only pious
people in the house."</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear fellow," said the notary, "fill your
glass again; take another cigar."</p>

<p>"I and my husband," continued the lady, "have done everything
to keep up the respectability of the establishment, for Mrs.
Nicely is a good sort of a person, and we pity her very much
because she is a widow, and is trying to get along and support
her family, but she will take all sorts of people into her house,
and only last week rented one of her rooms to a Unitarian!"</p>

<p>"It's a fact, sir!" said the notary, as he filled his glass, and
then repeated again, "a positive fact, sir!" as though so great
an outrage required a double attestation before it could be credited.</p>

<p>"But I can't put up with everything," said Mrs. Hopton,
"and I and my husband have given Mrs. Nicely notice that we
shall leave here in the fall. The ladies in the house, too, are all
so very quarrelsome; I never got into such a family before.
They talk about everybody, and carry tales from one room to
another, and if you will believe it, Mrs. Witchley, that I have
done everything for, has had the cruelty to tell Mrs. Bumstead,
that I said that Lieutenant Minton had told my husband that she
dressed like a dowdy!"</p>

<p>"That Minton is a dangerous fellow," said the notary.</p>

<p>"I am sure it was nothing but the truth, if Lieutenant Minton
did say so," continued the lady, "but it isn't at all likely that I
should repeat such a thing about anybody, especially to Mrs.
Witchley, for everybody knows what sort of a woman she is, and
I should as soon think of trusting I don't know what with
almost anybody, as trusting her with a secret. But if Mrs.
Nicely will have such people in her house, she must take the
consequences. I am sure I can't put up with everything."</p>

<p>"Witchley!" said I; "the name sounds familiarly to me. I
think I have heard it before."</p>

<p>"It's Witchley &amp; Mittings," said the notary, as he lighted
another cigar.

<!-- Volume I, Page 203 -->

<p>"O, I don't think you ever knew her," said Mrs. Hopton;
"she isn't anybody. She comes from a very ungenteel family.
To my certain knowledge, her father kept a retail shoe-store
in Pearl street. But notwithstanding all that, I have done everything
for Maria Witchley. However, there is no such thing in
the world as gratitude. But for my part, I think it is the duty
of every Christian to put down such conduct. They say her
husband is rich, and I hope he is, for such a wife would soon
ruin her husband, if he was as rich as Cassius."</p>

<p>"Cr&oelig;sus!" said the notary.</p>

<p>"It's all the same thing," said his lady; "I and my husband
live as prudently as we can, and our expenses are frightful.
But I am sure we give away for charitable objects twice as much
as Maria Witchley ever did. I am working purses now to get
money enough to make our minister a life member of the Foreign
Missionary Society. But I don't believe Maria Witchley has
contributed anything for any benevolent institution this year.
For my part, I think we might as well be out of the world as in
it, if we do no good to anybody. But what can people do if they
spend everything on themselves? Mr. Witchley may be able to
bear it, and I hope he is. I am sure I should be sorry to hear
of anything happening to him, for Maria Witchley is not the person
to bear adversity, and her friends are dreadfully poor. She
is an Episcopalian, and we all know what they are. I have said
everything to that woman; I have even told her sister how
imprudent she was, but still she will go on in her own way,
dressing in the most extravagant manner, and doing everything.
I love her like a sister, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her husband has got stuck for a pretty good sum today,"
said the notary, filling his glass again. "He may be able to
stand it; but I don't know how it will be with him."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me, my love," said Mrs. Hopton, putting her
handkerchief to her eyes, "that Maria Witchley's husband is
going to fail?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether he will fail or not, but he is among

<!-- Volume I, Page 204 -->

the bears to-day, in Wall street. He discounted a note for old
Gilson, with Bassett's name upon it, which I protested today, and
it turned out that Bassett's name was a forgery."</p>

<p>"Pray, sir," said I, "was it a note for three thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"The exact sum," said the notary.</p>

<p>"Then I am sure he will fail," said Mrs. Hopton, "and as I
think it the duty of every Christian to put people on their guard
against losses, particularly poor widows, I have a great mind to
go this very night, before I get into my bed, and tell Mrs.
Nicely, for I am sure I can never rest, knowing that I have
neglected my duty. O, what a world this is, Mr. St. Hugh!
To think that Maria Witchley's husband should fail! It makes
my heart bleed for that poor woman. Well, it only makes my
words good, for I always said, and I always shall say it, pride
will have a fall. Maria Witchley has carried her head too high.
It won't do for people in this world to put on airs; particularly
for professing Christians, for we know what the Apostle says:
'He that is first shall be last of all,' and I have always found it
so in my experience. Maria Witchley little thought, when she
brushed past me with that Cashmere shawl, last week, in Broadway,
that the time would come when she would be very glad to
wear a broche shawl, like mine, which is good enough for any
body. But I and my husband don't depend upon outside show
for respectability. I come from a better family than ever Maria
Witchley did, and my father would no more have associated
with her father, than I don't know what. But, poor thing, I pity
her, and would do anything for her; and sooner than see her
want, I would go round with a subscription paper for her to all
of her friends. But I shall say nothing about her, for, as I often
tell my husband when he goes on about people that have their
notes protested, a still tongue, as the Apostle says, is a wise one."</p>

<p>"And who will bear the loss of the note?" said I, for I
remembered now that it was the very note which old Gil had told
me to take to Mr. Bassett, and inquire if his signature was
genuine.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 205 -->

<p>"That's hard to say," replied the notary, "but old Gilson
will suffer some to-night, for Witchley's partner was so enraged
about it, that he had the old fellow arrested for passing a forged
note. Gilson made a very lame statement about the affair; the
man of whom he took the note had gone to Texas, and his clerk,
who, he said, had shown the signature to Bassett, had also run
off; and it is now a question of veracity between Gilson and
Bassett. But nobody doubts Bassett, while nobody will believe
Gilson. So the old fellow has gone to prison for to-night, and
there is no knowing what will come of it. All I care about it is
that I shall get a fee for protesting the note."</p>

<p>"Well, I always said there was something wrong about that
Mr. Gilson," said Mrs. Hopton, "and though he is an elder in
our church, I never had any confidence in him. His daughters
are the most extravagant girls that come inside of the church,
and the way they dress is very unbecoming in professors. Two
new figured silks in one season, such as that Pauline wears, and
not scintched in the pattern, either, but made very full, with deep
flounces, and capes with ruffles, is enough to ruin any man, and
I shouldn't wonder if he has done a good many other things. I
guess everything will come right in the end. I and my husband
are plain kind of people; we make no show, but mind our business
and let other people alone. I guess we shall be thought as
much of in the end as though we were always talking about
everybody, and trying to make a noise in the world. I guess it
will be found in the end that there's good and bad of all persuasions,
as the Apostle says. For my part I think the best way
for everybody in this world is, to mind their own business and
have no nonsense, and I rather think it will be found in the end,
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my dear madam, for interrupting you," I said,
for I was growing very nervous and impatient, "do you say that
Mr. Gilson has actually been imprisoned on a charge of passing
a forged note?"</p>

<p>"Fact!" said the notary.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 206 -->

<p>"And why," said I, "did not Mr. Barton stand his bail?"</p>

<p>"Old Gil sent for him," said the notary, "but he refused. I
don't know why, but it was something about one of old Gil's
daughters. I didn't hear any of the particulars, for all that I
was thinking about was the protest of the note."</p>

<p>I had heard enough, and my face burnt with shame. Here
was another effect of my falsehoods. I grew sick at the thought
of the misery of old Gil's family, which I had occasioned. And
poor Pauline, who had such a fondness for her father, how must
she be grieved at his disgrace. There was but one course to
pursue, and that I resolved upon without hesitation: to go and
inform the Gilsons of the old man's innocence and my own guilt.
Humiliating as it was to my pride, I resolved to do it before I
slept, even though it should cost me the regard of Pauline, which
I feared more than all. The loss of the money I could not make
up, but I could remove the stain upon the old man's character,
and relieve the distress of the family, and this I intended to do
without delay. So, declining Mrs. Hopton's polite invitation to
join her and her husband in an address to the Throne of Grace,
and assuring her that Mr. Gilson was innocent of the crime of
forgery, let him be guilty of what other crimes he might, I left
the notary and his wife to their devotions, and putting on my
cloak and hat hurried into the street, and walked rapidly towards
old Gil's house. Had I been Tom Pepper still, I might have
fallen into the wretched sophistry that had misled me before, and
caused me to commit so many errors. But as Eustace St. Hugh,
the heir of an honorable name, and the descendant of ancestors
who had never been accused of a dishonorable act, I felt myself
bound to confess my past errors. To confess my baseness would
be some mitigation, I thought, of my offence; and Pauline might
forgive me out of gratitude for relieving her father from the
odium of the crime with which he was charged. It was already
late; the bells had struck twelve before I left the house and I
hurried myself in the hope of reaching Gilson's before the
family had retired. But when I got to the door there were no

<!-- Volume I, Page 207 -->

lights to be seen. Everywhere was dark and silent. I listened,
but could hear no one stirring, and had partly determined not to
disturb the unhappy family, when, looking up to the window of
Pauline's chamber, in the hope of seeing a light, I thought of
that lovely girl, and fancied her lying grieving at her father's
disgrace. This thought fixed my determination, for I could not
endure the reflection that one whom I loved so sincerely should
be suffering from any fault of mine. I rang the door-bell, but no
one came. I knocked upon the door and made a great noise,
but still there was no reply. I could not conceive the cause of
this, but finding that it would be idle to continue to knock at the
door, I returned to my boarding-house, sad and dispirited. I had
forgotten to inform Mrs. Nicely that I was going out, and now I
found it as difficult to get into my boarding-house as into old
Gil's. I rang the bell with great violence, but the sleepy
servants either did not hear me, or would not leave their warm
beds, and finding that I as not likely to effect an entrance that
night, I had just made up my mind to go to a hotel and procure
a lodging, when I saw some men coming up the street, and stopped
to see who they were. I stood on the steps of my boarding-house,
and I was startled, as they got abreast of the door, to see
them halt. It was a bright moonlight night, and although they
stood in the shadow of the house, I saw at once they were a party
of marines, with cutlasses in their hands, and the man who
appeared to be their leader I discovered the next moment to be
Lieutenant Minton, and guessed the object he was after, which
was myself. There were half a dozen of the marines, with a
corporal, dressed in their long light-blue coats and foraging caps,
and with cutlasses by their sides. I pulled the bell furiously
and pounded upon the door with all my might, with the hope of
getting inside, where I could defend myself or call for help; but
no one came to let me in, and the lieutenant, seeing who I was,
ordered the marines to seize me. Resistance was useless, but I
endeavored to make my escape. The lieutenant swore that he
would flog every soul of them when they returned to the ship, if

<!-- Volume I, Page 208 -->

they allowed me to escape; hearing this, they seized me, and in
spite of the resistance I made, dragged me off the steps and
hauled me along the street. I not only fought and struggled
with all my might, using both feet and fists without the least
reserve, and dealing some pretty hard kicks upon the shins of the
marines, but I cried out for help as loud as I could bellow. The
streets were perfectly still, for it was long past midnight, and the
noise I made soon attracted some watchmen, who came running
towards us, striking their clubs upon the flagging. As soon as
they came within hearing, I claimed their protection, but the
lieutenant told them that I was a deserter from Uncle Sam, and
threatened, if they attempted to interfere, to order the marines to
charge bayonet upon them, upon which they took themselves off,
and left me to my fate. The lieutenant kept his sword drawn
in his hand, and threatened, if I did not desist, to run me through
the body. But the thought of being taken to the ship and subjected
to another flogging, made me desperate, and in reply to
his threats I called him a cowardly poltroon, and defied him to
do his worst upon me. The distance they dragged me though
the street was not far, for they landed from the frigate's cutter
at one of the piers on the North River, nearly opposite my boarding-house;
there the boat was waiting, in charge of a midshipman,
to receive me, and the lieutenant, in his hurry to get me
on board, gave me a shove with his foot, in return for which,
suddenly jerking my right hand from the grasp of the marine
who held me, I struck him a blow in the face that would have
knocked him into the river, if he had not been caught by one of
the marines. They got me into the boat at last, but not without
some difficulty, and then, with the aid of the boat's crew, put my
wrists and ancles into iron hand-cuffs. As soon as they had
done this, the coxswain gave the order to shove off the boat, the
crew tossed their oars, and then letting them fall, gave way, and
began to pull for the frigate that lay a mile off, looming up, a
black, indistinct mass against the leaden sky. The water
sparkled as the boat rushed through the ripples of the river, and

<!-- Volume I, Page 209 -->

at every dip of the oars my heart sunk, as I saw the line of the
wharves growing more and more indistinct, as we shot away
from them. As I thought of the probable fate which awaited me
on board the frigate, of the imprisonment of old Gil and the distress
of his family, but, more than all, of the astonishment and
doubt of Mr. Bassett when he should hear of my absence, and
know nothing of the cause, I could not refrain from tears and
begged the lieutenant to put me on shore again, telling him that
the happiness of a good many people depended upon my being at
liberty.  All the reply he made was to strike me with the flat of
his sword, and assure me that I should never step my feet upon
dry land again, as I would be hung at the yard arm before I was
ten days older. By this time the cutter reached the frigate's
side, and the shackles were taken off my ancles, to enable me to
ascend the companion-way ladder.</p>

<p>The frigate's deck presented a novel sight to me. There were
no lights to be seen; a solitary marine was pacing a plank in the
waist of the ship, with his musket to his shoulder; the officer of
the deck, wrapped in a shaggy jacket which reached nearly to
his heels, stood by the companion-way, and a quarter-master was
walking to and fro on the poop-deck, with a spy-glass under his
arm. Those were the only forms stirring; the decks were dark
and silent, but I saw that between the guns the watch lay coiled
up, some of them with their heads resting on shot-boxes, and some
lying flat on the deck, sound asleep.</p>

<p>But I had little chance to make any observations, for I was
seized directly by the marines, who took me down on to the
lower deck, and thrusting me into a very small room, which was
perfectly dark, again put the shackles upon my feet, and a sentry
being placed at the door, with a cutlass in his hand, I was left to
myself.</p>

<p>One of the boat's crew came down very soon, and gave me
his pea-jacket to lie upon, and kindly offered me some tobacco,
which I took, lest he should think I slighted his favor, but I had
never fallen into so bad a habit as to use the vile stuff. Although

<!-- Volume I, Page 210 -->

I was sufficiently alive to the perils of my situation, and could
do anything desperate, I was so enraged, yet I had scarcely sat
down upon the pea-jacket to rest, when I fell into a sweet sleep,
which continued until I was waked by the firing of a gun, and
the noise of a fife and drum playing the <i>reveille</i>.  There was a
great hubbub over head, the shrill notes of the boatswains'
whistles were constantly heard, and from the running about and
bustle I concluded that something unusual was going on, and
began to think that preparations were making for my execution.
It was still dark, and the marine who had been placed as a
sentry over me, had been called away. I could see nobody
moving on the berth-deck, where I was confined, and I passed
an uncomfortable hour, thinking of the probabilities of my fate,
and wondering at the opinions which would be entertained about
me by Mr. Bassett. By and bye I perceived a ray of pale light
which poured down the hatch-ways, but I could not see a soul
moving. The noise on deck continued, and rather seemed to
increase than abate. Another hour or two passed away, when a
marine was again stationed as a sentry over me. The irons had
been removed from my ancles, but my hands were still in ruffles,
as they called the hand-cuffs by which they were fastened
together. Knocking with these against the door of the little
room in which I was confined, I attracted the attention of the
sentry, and asked him what was the cause of the hubbub on
deck, when I learned, to my amazement and horror, that they
were getting the ship under weigh, and that in a very short time
we should be at sea.</p>

<p>The marine could not tell me where the ship was bound, but
he believed it was round the Cape, but whether Cape Horn or
Cape of Good Hope, he didn't know.</p>

<p>I was nearly stunned by this crushing intelligence, and at
once gave up all hope of ever again seeing my father, or conveying
to him and Mr. Bassett the cause of my last disappearance.
But I remembered that Swayne was on board, and asked the
marine who was stationed to keep watch over me, to have the

<!-- Volume I, Page 211 -->

goodness to tell the quarter-master that Tom Pepper was in irons
below, and wished to speak to him.</p>

<p>The marine said that it would be as much as his life was
worth if he left his post; and, furthermore, that Swayne had
been transferred to the receiving ship at the Navy Yard, by the
request of a merchant, who wanted to use his evidence in an
important case, in which Swayne was in some way concerned,
and that he had left the frigate with his traps, the day before.
On hearing this I uttered a loud groan, for I now saw that there
was no possible hope of my escape, either from the ship or from
a flogging.</p>

<p>The marine inquired of me the nature of my offence, and
hearing that I had struck an officer, said that I might make
myself entirely easy as to the result of my trial, for he could
promise me that I should be hung, as that was an offence which
Uncle Sam was never known to overlook. The marine told me
not to be disheartened about it, for I might be sure of a watch
below all the time, and my messmates would keep me well supplied
with plenty of grog and tobacco.</p>

<p>The marine evidently looked upon me as in a situation to be
envied, but I was not much elevated by his encouraging manner
of treating my misfortune, which he perceived by my dejected
looks, and to give still more comfort, he said:</p>

<p>"There is one thing you will be sure of, ship-mate; if you
be hung you will not die before your time comes. There is a
good deal in that; and you must die sometime or other. As for
hanging, I have heard it is as easy a death as a man can die,
and for my part I would much prefer being hung on board a
ship, than in the yard of a dismal jail. There are no doctors at
sea to cut you up, and as for being buried in the ocean, I can
tell you, ship-mate, it is as comfortable a way of having a funeral
as need be. I have seen many a one at sea, and hope to see
many more. They just take and sew you up in your hammock,
with thirty-two pound shot at your feet, put you on a plank,
rest one end of it in the companion-way; back the main-top sail,

<!-- Volume I, Page 212 -->

read some prayers, raise up the inside end, and plump you go
overboard. It's doing the thing clean, and no mistake. I
always hated those dismal black hearses, and stones rattling on
your coffin."</p>

<p>I begged the fellow to stop talking in this vein, as I had sufficient
cause to be melancholy already.</p>

<p>"O, very well," said he, "if it's unpleasant to you I won't
say anything more on that subject. But as you haven't been
in the service before, I thought you would like to know how it
was done." He walked back and forth in front of my den for
a while, and then suddenly stopping, appeared to be taking a
particular view of my person.</p>

<p>"That's a good fit you have on, ship-mate," said he. "I
rather guess I can tell you who made that coat. Wasn't it
Washburn? Just stand up; now, turn round. Yes, it is; I
know it. I worked for him many a year, and I should be working
for him now, if it hadn't been for brandy smashers. But it's
all one now; what must be, will be, you know. But, ship-mate,
if they do run you up to the yard-arm, and I can promise you
they will, you won't have any use for those new clothes, and you
had better give them to me. I can sell them to the purser's steward
for grog. If you are agreed to it, I will exchange with you for
a suit of my old uniform.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, all hands were now piped to breakfast, and
I got rid of my troublesome visitor. He was relieved by another
marine, from whom I could not extract a word. From the
motion of the ship it was very certain that we were under weigh,
and I soon learned from some of the crew, who came to look at
me out of curiosity, that we were already outside of the Hook,
with plenty of wind and a taut bowline. Nothing surprised
me more than the perfect indifference and carelessness of the
crew; none seemed to have a care where the ship was bound.
Every one that came to look at me offered me a piece of tobacco,
and although none besides the marine told me that I should be
hung, I could read in their countenances such a presentiment of

<!-- Volume I, Page 213 -->

my fate. During the whole of the first day I was kept confined,
and saw nothing of Lieutenant Minton, but the next morning I
was taken upon deck, and ushered into the presence of the
Captain who heard the accusations of the lieutenant against me,
and asked me what I had to say for myself.</p>

<p>I replied that I had nothing to say, but that I hoped my ignorance
of naval discipline would be some mitigation of my offence.
I confessed that I had struck the lieutenant, and would do so
again if I ever met him where we stood on equal ground. The
captain cautioned me to be careful of my words, as they would
weigh against me on a court martial.</p>

<p>The captain, whose name was Willing, formed a striking contrast
to the officers by whom he was surrounded. They were
nearly all pale and slender, but he was tall and stout, with a
broad, rosy countenance, and keen, black eyes. His hair was
but slightly sprinkled with grey, and there was frankness in
his manner that commanded respect.</p>

<p>"Well, my man," said Captain Willing, "there are serious
charges against you. The discipline of the service must be preserved,
and your ignorance of its rules can hardly be considered
an excuse for your striking your superior. First, you spoke in a
disrespectful manner to your superior officer; then you deserted,
which is an offence that cannot be overlooked; and, in addition to
this, you have been guilty of striking an officer, which is the
highest crime that can be committed. You will be tried by a
court martial to-morrow, and whatever the sentence of the court
may be, that you must make up your mind to abide by. I can
give you no hope to anticipate any mitigation of sentence by me.
The ship is bound on a long cruise, and it is necessary, in the
beginning of the voyage, to show the crew that order and subordination
must be preserved on board at all hazards. I shall,
therefore, make short work, and you shall soon know your fate.
Let it be what it may, you must bear it like a man; it will be
all the better for you. You entered the service of your own free
will, and have no right to murmur at its regulations."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 214 -->

<p>"Ah! it was not my own free will," I replied, "but my unfortunate
condition that drove me to it."</p>

<p>"That's the old excuse," said the captain; "I have heard it
a thousand times before. But I can make no allowances for
that. You came to us unsolicited, and if it was your ill luck
that sent you, why, you must blame your hard fortune, and not
the service."</p>

<p>I was then taken back again to my place of confinement,
having had but a glance at the ship, and only catching a glimpse
of the sea out of the half open port-holes on the gun-deck.</p>

<p>The perfectly calm but resolute manner of the captain gave
me greater cause for fear than I had had before; and his telling
me that it was necessary, at the commencement of the cruise, to
set an example of severity to his crew, convinced me that I
should be severely dealt with, and that the chances of hanging
were greatly against me. But I thought less of what I should
have to endure myself than of the distress of Mr. Bassett and
Pauline at my disappearance.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

</div>

<p>TOWARDS evening I was again taken from my place of confinement,
the irons were removed from my wrists, and I was
escorted by the sergeant of marines to the cabin of the captain,
whom I found sitting at his writing desk, attended solely by his
private secretary. He had just risen from his dinner table; his
face was flushed, and his eyes sparkled as though he had been
indulging in wine. He as dressed in full uniform, and his
noble figure as set off to great advantage by the addition of
epaulettes and a gold laced coat. On the table before him was
his gold-hilted sword, and looking round upon the guns and cutlasses
displayed in different parts of the cabin, I felt more sensibly
than I had done before, the real power of the hands into which I

<!-- Volume I, Page 215 -->

had fallen. Whether the captain had put on his uniform to impress
me with an idea of his dignity, or whether it were a piece
of etiquette, I do not know, but his majestic appearance certainly
gave me a higher degree of respect for his authority than I had
felt after seeing him in plain clothes. Directly after I entered
the cabin he told his secretary to withdraw, and when we were
alone, he said to me:</p>

<p>"Young man, I have learned from one of my officers that you
have respectable connections, and that your name is not Brown.
Is it so?"</p>

<p>"I replied that it was true, my name was not Brown; that I
had been guilty of a falsehood in saying that it was, for which I
was heartily sorry, and begged that he would allow me to be
called by my father's name, which was St. Hugh."</p>

<p>"St. Hugh!" said the captain; "that is an unusual name.
I once knew a fine fellow named St. Hugh, but of course he was
no relation of yours: and yet," he exclaimed, with an oath,
"you resemble him in the face. Come near me. Yes, by all
the sea gods! you do look like him! Who is your father, and
where is he?"</p>

<p>"Ah! said I, "my father was the best and bravest of men.
He was an Englishman, and a sailor, too; and he once commanded
as good a frigate as this, but where he is now I know
not; and I fear I shall never see him again."</p>

<p>"Do you know the name of the ship he commanded?" said
Captain Willing, starting upon his feet.</p>

<p>"I have been told it was the Endymion, and I know that he
sailed in her once," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared the captain, catching hold of me, and
squeezing me in his arms; "ha! ha! ha! You are the son of
my old friend St. Hugh, of the Endymion! ha! ha! ha!" and
he gave me another hug that came near putting an end to my
breathing existence. "What an ass I was not to see it in your
face at first! But, tut, tut, tut; I can't believe it, after all.
You have been deceiving me, and I will have you to the gangway

<!-- Volume I, Page 216 -->

for it. Somebody has told you to say it. That villain of
a marine has put you up to it."</p>

<p>"Sir!" said I, "I will explain nothing. If you think me
capable of a falsehood, it is very plain that you cannot think I
have any right to the name of St. Hugh! Send me back to
my place of confinement, and let me wait the issue of my trial.
But do not insult me by suspecting my honor."</p>

<p>"Enough, enough; say no more; I see who you are," said the
captain, resuming his seat. "Sit down by my side. My old
friend's son shall not stand before me. Your father and I, sir,
were friends together, ten years ago. Our ships lay in the harbor
of Valparaiso; we were together one night returning from a
dinner party, at the house of our Consul, when we were attacked
by robbers. It was late, the streets were deserted, and I was
unarmed. But St. Hugh had his sword, and by his courage he
beat off the three assassins, and saved my life as well as his own.
We were ever after like brothers; our ships sailed together, and
many a social time did we have in the Pacific. When we
parted he made me promise to pay him a visit at his house in
England, which I have never done, and I did not know that he
was living still. And you are his son? Ha! ha! ha! Now
tell me, if you choose, by what strange luck you got yourself
into this scrape; but if it is unpleasant to you, do not tell me a
word. I wish to know nothing more than that you are the son
of my old friend, St. Hugh. But, stop: he always told me he
was unmarried. He would not have deceived me. Have you
been trifling with me? If you have, you shall kiss the gunner's
daughter for it. Come, come; you are caught."</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied; "I am not caught. I am the son of
Captain St. Hugh, and yet he thought he told you true when he
said that he had never been married."</p>

<p>"What! was he married and all, without knowing it? Well,
that is a story you may tell to the marines, but you must not tell
it to an old sailor like me. I have been married myself, and
know all about it."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 217 -->

<p>The captain laughed at his wit, and called his steward to give
him a glass of brandy and water. I then was obliged to relate
to him the story that Mr. Bassett had told me, respecting my
father, and also the particulars of my leaving my native village,
which he listened to with great eagerness, and at the end, begged
my pardon for doubting my word. He said that he remembered
having heard Captain St. Hugh talk about frolicking in
Buzzard's Bay.</p>

<p>"But, St. Hugh," said he, "I am in a quandary. You have
broken the rules of the service, and if I allow you to escape
without punishment it will destroy the discipline of my ship. I
have ordered a court martial for to-morrow, when you must be
tried. If you were my own son I would not interfere, for the
discipline of the ship must be preserved. If you should be flogged,
St. Hugh, as soon as we arrive at Rio, where I mean to
remain a few weeks, to take in a fresh supply of provisions, and
visit some of the donnas of my acquaintance, I will give you
your discharge. You shall then send a challenge to Lieutenant
Minton, and have the satisfaction of a gentleman out of him, to
which you are entitled. I will provide a friend for you myself,
and send you across to Praya Grande in my own gig, where you
shall fight him like a man. I know that your father would have
done as much for a son of mine if he had fallen in with him at
sea, in this way."</p>

<p>I thanked the captain for his kindness, and asked him if there
was no way by which I could escape punishment without interfering
with the discipline of the ship. He shook his head, and
said he was sorry for me, and would do anything he could to
save me from the court martial, but he knew of no way in which
it could be safely done.</p>

<p>"It's nothing when it's all over," said the captain; "you
must learn to rough it, as your father and I did when we were
of your age. You will be all the better for it when you grow
up. A little discipline will be good for you."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 218 -->

<p>I told him that I had already been pretty well disciplined by
the two dozen lashes which I had received.</p>

<p>"What!" said the captain, "have you had two dozen lashes
on board this ship?"</p>

<p>I then told him the particulars of my flogging, upon which he
said he was very glad to hear it, for he would have the lieutenant
put under arrest for breaking the rules of the service, which
allowed of no more than twelve lashes being given at one time,
unless by order of a court martial.</p>

<p>I was going to leave him to deliver myself into the hands of
the sergeant of marines again, when he called me back and
said: "A thought has popped into my head, St. Hugh. You
shipped under the name of William Thompson!"</p>

<p>"Brown," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; William Brown&mdash;and you escaped under that
name, but you are brought back as Eustace St. Hugh. Now, I
can swear that you are the son of my old friend of the Endymion,
and all you have to do is to deny that your name was ever
anything besides St. Hugh, and how will they prove it! Ha!
ha! ha! You will have them there!  Then I will take you
into my cabin, and you shall be my companion the remainder of
the passage. Yes, there is nobody on board to prove that you
ever was William Brown, or anything else than Eustace St.
Hugh. Ha! Eustace St. Hugh, the son of my old friend of the
Endymion! And when we arrive at Rio, you shall be sent
home in the first ship. So, make yourself easy to-night; go
back to your quarters, and when you are called before the court
to-morrow, deny that you are William Brown, say that your
name is Eustace St. Hugh, and leave me to do the rest."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said I; "that I cannot do. I signed my name as
William Brown and I cannot deny it. I will not be guilty of
falsehood, let the peril of truth be what it may."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said the captain; "why did you enter the
service under false colors, if you are so scrupulous about your
word now?"

<!-- Volume I, Page 219 -->

<p>"Because I had not then learned how vile and dangerous it is
to lie. If I had always been sincere and truthful, I should not
be here now, but with my father. I will never sully the name
of St. Hugh by uttering an untruth. It was my own folly that
brought me to this condition, and I must put up with the consequences
as I can, unless you have power to shelter me."</p>

<p>"You are a trump, St. Hugh," replied the captain, "and I
would save you from a flogging, if I could. But, as I told you
before, if you were my own son I would not interfere with the
court martial. The discipline of the ship must be preserved, and
you must be prepared to meet your punishment like man, let
it be what it will. But I cannot see the son of my old friend
flogged on board my ship. Think over your nice scruples, to-night,
and in the morning do as I advise you."</p>

<p>"Never!" I replied; "I will never again be guilty of an
untruth. I have lost my father by a falsehood, and hereafter my
life shall be sincere and true; the truth can do me no greater
harm than a lie has already done."</p>

<p>"Poor St. Hugh!" exclaimed the captain, rising from his
seat and taking me by the hand; "poor fellow! I cannot
serve you now; but I will serve you hereafter. Lieutenant
Minton shall be dismissed from the service; before you reach
your quarters he shall be sent to his state-room. So good night
to you; keep up your spirits, but don't hope that I will remit
the sentence of the court, for if you should be sentenced to be
run up to the end of the fore-yard; or keel-hauled, or flogged, it
must be done. So, good night my boy, and keep a tight eye to
leeward for breakers."</p>

<p>It was not difficult to see that the captain was not himself; he
talked thick, and his face was flushed and feverish. I hoped,
therefore, that in the morning, when he felt more cool, and
remembered who I was, that his humanity would be stronger
than his love of discipline, and that he would save me from the
court martial.</p>

<p>When I left the captain's cabin, it was nearly dark; there

<!-- Volume I, Page 220 -->

was a fresh breeze, the top-sails and top-gallant sails were all
set, and the frigate was dashing through the water most gloriously.
It made my heart leap as I looked aloft and saw her immense
sails, and caught glimpses of the sailors in the tops, and saw
them running out to the extreme ends of the huge yards. I
could only see the water through the half opened ports of the
spar-deck, for the bulwarks were too high to look over them,
excepting when the frigate rolled to leeward, and then the
glimpse which I caught of the ocean filled me with grand but
melancholy feelings.  I was not allowed to remain long on the
upper deck, and I left it very unwillingly. The hammocks had
been piped down, the dog watch had been set, and many of the
sailors were below asleep; but there were still a good many on
deck, gathered together between the guns in clusters of eight or
ten, some listening to a long yarn told by one of their number,
others were singing, and some of the youngsters were dancing to
a fiddle, which was scraped by one of the cooks. As I went
below to my place of confinement there was a sharp flash of
lightning, and very soon after I heard a peal of thunder. This
was followed by a call of all hands to shorten sail. The fiddle
ceased, the story tellers and dancers were all dispersed to their
different stations, and nothing was heard but the shrill whistles
of the boatswain and his mates, and the hoarse bellowings of the
first lieutenant's trumpet. The marine who stood guard over
me said that we were on the edge of the gulf stream, and that we
should have a bad night of it. And it so proved. The thunder
kept growing louder and louder, until it sounded like a discharge
of guns over our heads, or like huge shot rolled over the decks.
The ship trembled at every peal, and notwithstanding that the
hatchways had all been covered over with tarpaulins to keep out
the rain, which had begun to fall in torrents, the berth-deck was
illuminated by the constant flashes of lightning. The motion of
the vessel was much more violent than it had been, and I could
plainly discover that the wind had increased to a gale. It was
frightful to hear the hubbub and noise above my head, and not to

<!-- Volume I, Page 221 -->

know what was going on. I begged the marine to allow me to
go upon deck, but he would not, and congratulated himself that
he was not exposed to the storm, like his companions. What
with the roaring of the wind, the rattling thunder, the dashing of
the waves, the creaking of timbers, the banging of ropes, the
flapping of sails, the bellowing of the officer of the deck, the pattering
of rain, and rattling of shot that had broken loose, the uproar
was frightful and stunning. There were no lights below where I was
confined, and, excepting when there was a vivid flash of lightning,
we were in complete darkness. This hubbub and hurly-burly
continued more than an hour, seemingly growing louder and
louder all the while, until there came a flash of lightning, accompanied
by a crushing clap of thunder, which very nearly
deprived me of my senses. The whole between-decks seemed to
be filled with fire, the air was suffocating, the ship trembled, and
there was a crushing noise, accompanied by a great uproar, that
filled me with fright and amazement. The darkness and silence
which immediately followed, were hardly less alarming. I
called to the marine who stood sentry over me, but he made no
reply. The decks appeared to be filled with smoke, there was
no one near, and I shouted with all my might, but no one came
to me. The noise above my head completely drowned my voice,
but I could distinguish sounds which seemed to me like groans
of distress. The little place in which I was confined was
secured by a wooden bar across the door. I tried to force it
open, and after two or three attempts, succeeded; bursting out
upon the deck I found the marine lying upon the floor, apparently
dead, and a cloud of smoke was rising from one of the
hatchways.  It was evident that the ship was on fire, and I
shouted, fire! fire! fire! and forced my way upon one of the
ladders which led to the main deck, where a scene of great confusion
presented itself. The alarm of fire instantly spread, the
captain came from his cabin, speaking trumpet in hand, and
gave directions for extinguishing the fire, which had taken somewhere
in the fore part of the ship, near the place of my confinement.

<!-- Volume I, Page 222 -->

The foremast had been struck with lightning, and a
great number of the crew had been stunned, but none had been
killed. By the activity of the men, and the good order which was
preserved among them, the effect of the strict discipline of the
captain, the fire was extinguished below before it had done much
harm; but, it having originated in the neighborhood of the magazine,
the utmost consternation pervaded the crew and officers
until it was completely smothered. Having gained my
liberty, I felt very unwilling to return to the dismal little cupboard
of a prison in which I had been confined. The captain
stood upon the poop-deck, with his trumpet in his hand, giving
orders, and I was completely charmed by his coolness of manner,
his perfect readiness, and his fine sonorous voice. I could
easily understand now the necessity of preserving the most rigid
discipline at all times on board of a ship, where there were so
many men, even in comparatively trivial matters, to insure perfect
obedience in times of difficulty and danger; and I could
readily conceive of the feelings of Captain Willing when he
refused to screen me from the decision of the court martial while
he showed so strong a desire to do me a kindness. I could not
understand the orders that were given, but I saw that they were
obeyed, and that there was no confusion, although there was so
great a noise, and such a variety of commands. The rain still
continued to pour down in torrents, the lightning glared, and the
thunder pealed. But the wind had almost subsided into a dead
calm, which was very fortunate, for I afterwards learned that the
foremast had been so much shattered by the lightning, that if it
had continued to blow with the same degree of violence as in the
commencement of the storm, it would have gone by the board,
and the ship would have been completely disabled.</p>

<p>Sheltering myself under the projecting roof of the poop, which
formed the captain's cabin, I stood and watched the operations of
the crew, and having on my citizen's dress, the lieutenants and
midshipmen passed me without noticing me, probably thinking
that I was one of the gun-room officers. But when the captain

<!-- Volume I, Page 223 -->

came off the poop-deck to go into his cabin, having given up the
command to his first lieutenant, he spoke to me as he passed and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha, doctor, what an escape we have had!"</p>

<p>"It's not the doctor," said I.</p>

<p>"Who is it then?" he said, taking me by the arm and looking
in my face, "What, St. Hugh! By all the sea gods, my boy,
you have seen more to-night than I have ever seen before in all
my going to sea. But how got you here? Come into my cabin
and tell me how you escaped."</p>

<p>"So then," said he, when I had told him how I had first discovered
the fire, and given the alarm, "So then, we are indebted
to you for the safety of the ship. Good, by all the sea gods, my
fine fellow, I would like to see the man who would attempt to
put the weight of a rope-yarn upon your back. This is all
right. It was your father who saved my life once, and now you
have saved it again, and the lives of my noble fellows, and my
old ship. I have put that pale-faced Minton under arrest, and
now that I have got you here you shall stay."</p>

<p>The commodore, for they called him commodore on board, was
all this time taking off his wet clothes, and he made use of tremendous
oaths all the while, which I have not thought it proper to introduce
into my narrative. He one of the old school of
naval officers, who think that oaths, grog, and flogging are
necessary parts of the service; and that without them there
would be nothing worth living for. He called for his brandy and
water, and would have me drink with him, very much against
my will. But he did something better than this, for he gave me
a dry suit of clothes, which were very acceptable, as I was wet
to the skin.</p>

<p>"This is a fortunate affair for you, St. Hugh," said he, seating
himself at his table again, after changing his clothes; "with
my shattered foremast I cannot proceed on my cruise, so I have
given orders to change the course of the ship, and I shall put
into Norfolk and repair damages; and then you shall be sent

<!-- Volume I, Page 224 -->

back to New York, and if you ever see my old friend of the
Endymion again, tell him that you and old Willing drank his
health in the gulf stream. Does anybody on board know of your
escape?"</p>

<p>I told him that nobody had spoken to me, and that I had kept
out of sight to prevent my being taken back to the place of my
confinement.</p>

<p>"Very good," said he; "ha! ha! ha! They shall not know
what has become of you. I will keep you here until we arrive
at Norfolk, and then you shall be sent on shore."</p>

<p>He then called his steward, and told him he had got a messmate,
and cautioned him to say nothing about it unless he wanted
to be made a spread-eagle of. A cot was provided for me to
sleep in, and having fallen into a profound slumber in the middle
of a long story which the captain was telling me, a sequel to the
adventure which he and my father had together in the Pacific, I
was allowed to lie down, and slept soundly until morning. I
was roused by the captain calling loudly for his steward; he demanded,
upon the appearance of that sable functionary, an explanation
of the strange appearance of an extra cot in his cabin.
He had forgotten the circumstance of taking me in the night before,
but as he recollected himself, he called to me to lie still, and
be careful not to expose myself to the observation of any of the
crew.</p>

<p>As no one but the captain's steward pretended to open his
cabin door, I was in little danger of being discovered, and finding
myself in pleasant quarters, with a full view of the sea from
the open ports and cabin windows, I felt in no hurry to arrive in
port. The morning had cleared off very pleasant; there was
just wind enough to fill the sails, a warm sun, and a bright blue sea.
The captain went out upon deck to see the extent of the damage
by the lightning, and when he returned had breakfast served, of
which I partook with a hearty appetite, for I had before eaten
but little of the ship's provisions. He told me that these was a
great ado among the officers about my disappearance, and they supposed

<!-- Volume I, Page 225 -->

that I had jumped overboard. The marine had recovered
from the effects of the lightning, and the damage done to the spars
being too great to be repaired at sea, we were bound into Norfolk,
where he expected that we should arrive the next day.</p>

<p>Whether any of the officers on board knew of my being in the
commodore's cabin I do not know, but I suspect that he informed
them all of the secret, for after our arrival at Hampton Roads,
which we did not reach until ten days after the accident which
happened to the frigate, partly in consequence of calms, and
partly on account of the crippled state of the foremast, he borrowed
a lieutenant's coat and cap for me to go ashore in. After
the ship came to anchor, he had his own boat got ready, and
having waited until dark, he took me to Norfolk. As we left
the cabin I observed that all the officers were on the poop, apparently
waiting to catch a glimpse of me, but I did not see
Lieutenant Minton among them, and have no doubt that he was
in his cabin under arrest, as the commodore assured me. It
was too late when we reached Norfolk to make any arrangements
for leaving the next day; but in the morning my new friend, for
whom I felt so strong an attachment, that I parted from him with
real sorrow, provided me a passage on board a steamboat, and
embracing me warmly cautioned me to keep clear from Uncle
Sam's service in my future rambles, and not to forget to remember
him to my father if I should ever find him; as though it
were possible for me ever to forget that brave old commodore,
who had treated me with such overflowing kindness. But he did
not seem conscious of having done a good deed, and for that reason
his kindness made a stronger impression upon my heart. He
gave me sufficient money to defray my expenses back to New
York, and would take no obligation for it, telling me that I might
pay it to the first sailor in want that I might fall in with, when I
got able.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

</div>

<p>LEST some accident should again befall me, to prevent my
reaching New York, I put a letter in the post office before
leaving Norfolk, informing Mr. Bassett that I was on my passage
back, and would explain to him the cause of my absence when I
should get home. It was fortunate for me that I did so, for I was
detained on the road between Philadelphia and Baltimore, by an
accident, and when I arrived in New York I found Mr. Bassett
at Mrs. Nicely's establishment, anxiously waiting for me. He had
never before shown so much pleasure in meeting me; the good
man's eyes filled with tears as he pressed me in his arms, and
said: "Thank God, Tom, for permitting me to see you once
more!"</p>

<p>I was delighted myself to be with my first and truest friend
once more, and felt the liveliest gratitude for his goodness to me.
But I was at a loss to account for the pleasure which he evidently
experienced in seeing me, for he had nothing to hope for from
me; I could render him no service, and I was now past the age
when he could find pleasure in petting me as he had done when
he first took me under his protection. I could not help thinking
that, having no children of his own to bestow his affections upon,
and being married to a woman who would not allow him to love
her, because she was so selfish as to forbid him to love anything
but her, that he lavished upon me the affection which his gentle
nature required should be bestowed upon something. I had not
the vanity to think that I was in any manner worthy of the
esteem of so good a man as Mr. Bassett. I knew my own
wickedness and deficiencies too well for that. But then I saw
that all human beings, however low in the scale of intellect, or
base in conduct, demanded sympathy and love from something,
and that those whose uncouthness or baseness repelled the
sympathies of their own species, found in horses and dogs, or in

<!-- Volume I, Page 227 -->

cats, monkeys or birds, the sympathy and attachment which all
nature demands.</p>

<p>I not only know, from observation, that love was a necessity
of all human beings, but I knew it from my own feelings; and I
thought that Mr. Bassett's kindness to me was the natural effect
of his being denied the privilege of having a child of his own.
Duty is a different thing from love, and if I had had any claim
upon Mr. Bassett, I cannot help thinking he would not have shown
so much regard for me. He told me that after my last disappearance
he had given up all hope of ever seeing me again, and
began to think that I and my father were the victims of some
secret enemy who had been dodging at our heels watching for an
opportunity to distress us. But now that I had returned, he had
hopes that I should yet have the good fortune to meet my father,
which made me very happy.</p>

<p>He then made me sit down and tell him everything that had
happened to me since he had last seen me. When I had finished
the narrative of my adventures, he looked at me very seriously
and said:</p>

<p>"It is a very strange story, Tom. It sounds like a romance.
Do you expect me to believe it, after all the fictions you have
told me?"</p>

<p>I was too much hurt by this unexpected reproof to reply at
once, but as soon as I could collect myself, I said to him:</p>

<p>"I now feel how guilty I must be, since my conduct has lost
me your confidence. This is a blow that I was not prepared
for; but the fault is my own."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my poor boy," said Mr. Bassett; "I did not
mean to reproach you; I do believe your story. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, "you are sorry that you have hurt my feelings,
but you believed what you said, and it is that which grieves me.
I know now that you have lost your regard for me; that you no
longer believe what I tell you, and therefore you cannot love
me."</p>

<p>"I did not mean what I said, Tom;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 228 -->

<p>"Then why did you say it?" I replied. "You did mean
what you said, but you did not mean to say it; and it is because
you spoke unconsciously and therefore truly, that I feel the force
of your words. It is not you that I blame, but myself."</p>

<p>"You are right Tom," said Mr. Bassett; "you have distinguished
rightly between my thoughts and my motives. It cannot
be helped, my boy; you see what power there is in a word,
and how important it is to remember the lesson which I once
taught you, to keep your thoughts pure, that your words may
never give offense. Man is not a mere talking machine, but a
thinking one, and speech was designed to express his thoughts,
not to disguise them, as has been thought by some. But
thoughts cannot be disguised; they will show themselves without
the thinker knowing it&mdash;there is a language of action, and of
looks, as well as of words&mdash;and your thoughts will discover
themselves in spite of all your endeavors to hide them. Therefore,
accustom yourself to good thinking, that you may never be
compelled to play the part of a hypocrite, which is the most
detestable and universally hated of all the sins which mankind
commit."</p>

<p>"I know it all; I have experienced the evils of falsehood in
all their bitterness," I replied. "I have been guilty of deceit
and dissimulation; I have been a hypocrite and have told
untruths; but hereafter my lips shall be unsullied by such sins."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Tom, and remember your propensity," said Mr.
Bassett; "remember that to make such a promise and then break
it, will be in itself a worse sin than to be guilty of a falsehood
without having done it."</p>

<p>"I will never transgress in that way again," I said; "since
I knew that my true name was St. Hugh, I have not violated the
integrity of my word; and henceforth, no evil that can befall
me shall compel a falsehood from my lips, nor any good fortune
beguile me into a deceitful act. When I cannot live by truth, I
will die."</p>

<p>"Bravely said, Tom!" exclaimed Mr. Bassett; "do but

<!-- Volume I, Page 229 -->

keep your promise, and you will be in no fear of dying. But,
do you really love Truth for its own sake, or from some selfish
thought that it will promote your own interests?"</p>

<p>"I know not." I said, "what the secret of my feelings is; but
I know that I do so detest an untruth, that I will never countenance
one again. Believe me, for I am in earnest"</p>

<p>"Be cautious, Tom," said Mr. Bassett; "you will find it
hard to overcome an old habit."</p>

<p>"I am strong in my resolution; I know that I shall never
swerve!"</p>

<p>"Very well; I believe you. You now know the evils of
falsehood, and when you experience the sweets of sincerity and
perfect truthfulness, you will have a double inducement to persevere
in your resolution. But you have a hard trial to undergo
in confessing the deceptions which you have already been guilty
of, and of bearing up under the odium of self-convicted
deceiver. Can you do this? You can! Very well. My poor
boy, I would ease you of your burden, if I could; but you must
bear the consequences of your own transgressions."</p>

<p>"I am prepared," I replied.</p>

<p>"It is well for you," he said; "be true to yourself, and you
need fear no harm. It is late now, I cannot reveal to you the
plans which I propose for your future conduct; it will be time
enough to-morrow. To-night you have need of repose. But
before I part with you, I must extract a promise from you not to
leave this city, nor to make any engagements respecting your
future conduct, without first informing me of your intentions."</p>

<p>"I promise," I said.<p>

<p>"Enough; and now, my son, good night. Mrs. Bassett is
already impatient at my delay. I will see you again in the
morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett then shook my hand and left me. I had taken
possession of the room which I had occupied before at Mrs.
Nicely's establishment, but had seen no one belonging to the
house, excepting a servant. Mr. Bassett had hardly left me
when there was a tap at the door.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 230 -->

<p>It was a girl, with Mr. and Mrs. Hopton's compliments, who
wished to see me in their room, just one minute. I found the
notary and his wife in the same condition in which I had left
them; he was smoking a cigar, and occupying two chairs,
sitting in one, while his feet were elevated upon the back of the
other, and Mrs. Hopton was industriously engaged upon a bead
bag, the sale of which, she had informed me, was to help make
up a sum to constitute the Rev. Doctor Somebody a life member
of some tract society.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said the notary as I entered, and he made
a slight motion with his legs, though he wanted to impress
me with the idea that he was going to rise from his seat, and
expected me to say, "Don't rise, sir." But I said nothing of
the kind, and so he contented himself by thinking that if I had a
mind to be uncivil, he wouldn't be at the trouble of throwing
away any politeness upon me. But his wife immediately rose
and reached me her hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do, Mr. St. Hugh? I am delighted to
see you. You look very well."</p>

<p>She evidently expected me to return her compliment to my
good looks, and tell her the same; but I did not think she looked
very well, by any means, so I merely replied to her by saying
that I was very well.</p>

<p>"Come, take a cigar," said the notary. "I found a new
brand to-day; they are a very superior article."</p>

<p>I took the cigar, for I was still addicted to that injurious
habit, smoking; but I found that the new brand was an old
cigar, and told him so, which he didn't seem to like.</p>

<p>"There have been such works in this house since you have been
absent, Mr. St. Hugh!" said Mrs. Hopton, laying down her
bead-work. "You will be astonished to hear how some people
have been going on. Maria Witchley's husband has been
behaving in the most dreadful way, and, for a professor, perfectly
awful. I am sure, for my part, I don't know what the world is
coming to. People, now-a-days, Mr. St. Hugh, seem to have no
consciences, no goodness, nor no respect for religion, whatever."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 231 -->

<p>"What can you expect," said the notary, "when there are so
many <i>isms</i> going about, and a parcel of agrarians are trying to
do away with hanging and the rights of property? I used to
think, once, that there was some virtue in the people, but I have
given up that notion ever since they began to talk about taking
away bank charters. I shouldn't wonder if the next thing were
an attempt to choose judges by the people."</p>

<p>"No, my dear, they will never come to that," said his wife.
"My father, who was Judge of Queens, always said, if the people
laid their hands on the Bench, the country was gone. Poor
man! I am glad he didn't live to see these times; he never
could have died in the happy way he did if he had."</p>

<p>"However," said the notary, "it is best to take the world
easy. For my part, I shall not trouble myself about the people;
if they choose to go to destruction, let them go. I shall take
care of myself. Come, St. Hugh, try a glass of my pale sherry;
it's some that I got of Duff Gordon's agent, and I think the flavor
is rather better than that of the Amontillado."</p>

<p>"My father, the late Judge of Queens," said Mrs. Hopton,
"was an excellent judge of wines. Ah! he knew something
about society; but I declare it makes me really sick to hear a
mere parveneer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Parvenue," said the notary.</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken, my dear," said his lady; "but it
makes but little difference what people say, if the heart is only
right. But I do say it is enough to make anybody sick, to hear
a mere mushroon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Room!&mdash;r double o, m," said the notary.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I hope you will be satisfied by and bye,"
said his lady, rather sharply; "what matter is it what people
say; if they only mean well? As I was saying, it is enough to
make anybody sick to hear a mere nobody, without any pretentions
to gentility or family connections, like that Maria Witchley's
husband, talk about wines."</p>

<p>"I advise you to be careful of that Witchley," said the

<!-- Volume I, Page 232 -->

notary; "he is a dangerous fellow. I might say something about
him, if I chose, but I make it a point never to trouble myself
about other people."</p>

<p>"Well, I will say this about them to you, Mr. St. Hugh,
because we are friendly to you," said the notary's wife: "there
is no end to what he has said about you. He called you everything,
and Maria Witchley herself, made use of the most unladylike
expressions about you. There is nothing that they didn't
say about you&mdash;and they are professors, too!"</p>

<p>"Maria Witchley and her husband talk about me!" I said, in
amazement. "I never saw either of those persons. Why should
they talk about me? I thank you for telling me, and I will call
upon Mr. Witchley for an explanation of his conduct."</p>

<p>"Don't do that," said the notary; "treat him with silent contempt.
It will work him up."</p>

<p>"What, sir!" I replied, "shall I harbor in my breast ill feelings
towards a man, for what he said about me, and give him no
opportunity to explain his motives? No; I cannot be guilty of
such dissimulation. I shall demand an explanation of his conduct,
for his aspersions of me must be based upon a mistake. I
have been guilty of many vile things, but none that he can
know."</p>

<p>"I think, myself, as the late Judge of Queens used to say,"
chimed in Mrs. Hopton, "that it is best always to take Time by
the fetlock, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forelock, forelock, my dear; how many times have I told
you, forelock?" said the notary.</p>

<p>"I am not going to give up always; I think I may be
allowed to know something," said Mrs. Hopton, "and I shall say
fetlock, if it costs me my life."</p>

<p>"O, well, my dear; then I shall not pretend to say anything
more about it" replied her husband, with great calmness.</p>

<p>"It is best, generally to take Time by the fetlock, I think,
myself," resumed the lady, "but in this case, I would advise
you as a friend, Mr. St. Hugh, not to say a word to the Witchleys;

<!-- Volume I, Page 233 -->

and if they say anything to you, don't give them any
answer whatever. They are not worth anybody's notice; and
it is just as likely as not that they might say something about
me; but, for my part, I don't want to have anything whatever to
do with them; a still tongue is a wise one; and smooth water
always runs deep; the least said is the soonest over, and it is a
long lane that never comes to an end. For my part, I think, as
the Apostle says, it is an ill wind that blows nobody away."</p>

<p>"My dear, I have often cautioned you against quoting proverbs,"
said the notary; "you never get them right."</p>

<p>"Well," said his lady, "if I don't, I don't know who should."</p>

<p>I was weary of this tattle, and rising from my seat, I said: "I
have no right to question your motives in telling me that the
Witchleys have slandered me, and I thank you for it; in the
morning I shall demand an explanation from Mr. Witchley, and
I have no doubt that he will be able to give me a satisfactory one."</p>

<p>"What!" said the lady, "will you if <i>I</i> request you not to, for
my sake?"</p>

<p>"If you were anxious that I should not speak to the Witchleys,
you should not have told me of their speaking ill of me," I
replied.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said the notary, "the Witchleys are a kind of
people who care nothing at all about appearances, and if we had
not told you what they had been saying, they would probably
have told you themselves."</p>

<p>"They are just bad enough," said the lady, and then took out
her handkerchief, and began to be very much overcome by her
feelings.</p>

<p>"Calm your apprehensions, my dear," said the notary;
"when Mr. St. Hugh hears how we have been drawn into this
disagreeable business, if he is a gentleman he will not insist upon
disturbing the peace of a respectable family, by calling upon
such people as the Witchleys, upon any pretense. I can
answer for him. Sit down, my dear St. Hugh, and drink
another glass of sherry."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 234 -->

<p>"Do, now, Mr. St. Hugh," said Mrs. Hopton; "it will do
you good. I and my husband took such a liking to you, that
you don't know what we suffered in your absence, and when we
heard you had returned, I said to my husband, we will caution
him against those Witchleys, before he has an opportunity to get
into any difficulty with them. They are people of no principle
or family connection whatever, and they have taken a great dislike
to my husband and me, for no reason in the world but
because I have been so kind to them, and have done everything
for Maria, whom I always loved and thought the world of."</p>

<p>"Very remarkable reasons" said I, "for taking a dislike to a
person."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Mrs. Hopton; "and that is why it seems so
cruel to me."</p>

<p>"The fact is, my dear fellow," said the notary, "Mrs.
Hopton, who takes a great interest in the Witchleys, happened
to mention, in confidence, to one of the ladies in the house, that
Mr. Witchley either had, or probably would, fail; this was told
by somebody or other to Mrs. Witchley, who of course, told her
husband, and he pretended to be in a great rage about it."</p>

<p>"Just for so trifling a thing as that," said the lady, "and you
may judge from that circumstance what kind of a person he is."</p>

<p>"So, he comes to me for an explanation, I disclaim all knowledge
of the business, my wife is then called upon, and she,
being under the impression that you had told her, in the hurry
of the moment, said that it was you who had set the report
afloat; and he, taking advantage of your absence, and thinking
that you would never return to defend yourself, made use of the
most dreadful expressions about you. You see now how the case
stands."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I see it plainly," I said; "your wife circulated a
falsehood about Mr. Witchley, and took advantage of my
absence to lay the invention of it at my door. Is not that it?"</p>

<p>"No gentleman," said Mrs. Hopton, "would ever accuse a
lady of telling a falsehood!"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 235 -->

<p>"No lady," said I, too hastily I admit, for I did not mean to
tell Mrs. Hopton that she was no lady, because she had confessed
to telling a fib, "would be guilty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, will you hear your wife called no lady by such a
person as Mr. St. Hugh? Ah, if my poor father was alive, he
would protect me from insult."</p>

<p>"Mr. St. Hugh," said the notary, "I rather think you will
have to recall those words, and make an apology to my lady."</p>

<p>"I think differently," I replied; "I shall make no apology
except to Mr. Witchley, whom I wronged, by being the means
of his purchasing a spurious note. For the injury that he
suffered though my misrepresentation, I shall make a humble
acknowledgment, and if possible, repay him the money he has
lost. But I shall clear myself from the charge of having
wantonly endeavored to injure his credit."</p>

<p>"That's very plain language, Mr. St. Hugh," said the notary,
shaking his head at me. "Do you mean to insinuate that my
wife, sir, a professor of religion, told a falsehood?"</p>

<p>"It was on your own authority that I said it," I replied.</p>

<p>"What will you do, sir?" said the notary.</p>

<p>"I shall call upon him and assure him that I never said anything
against him, and that all that I ever heard against him was
from you and your wife."</p>

<p>"You had better be careful, sir; you must remember that
there is such a thing as Law, and, more than that, such a thing
as the Law of Libel," said the notary. "If you traduce the
character of my wife or myself, I shall have you up for it."</p>

<p>"I shall tell the truth, sir," I replied, "let the consequences
be what they may."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Hopton. "You will tell the truth!
Well there is one comfort for us, my dear; nobody will believe
him. We know you, and the Witchleys know all about you,
too; it's all over town about Tom Pepper's lies. You can't
hurt our character; we are in regular standing in Doctor Longtext's
church, thank you, and our word will be taken before

<!-- Volume I, Page 236 -->

yours. I and my husband are well known as professors, and
you can't injure us. You call yourself Mr. St. Hugh, but you
are no more Mr. St. Hugh than I am. Come."</p>

<p>"My name was Tom Pepper once," I replied, while my cheeks
burned with shame to acknowledge it, "but it is St. Hugh now."</p>

<p>"We know all your aliases," said the notary.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said his lady; "every horse has his day, and it
takes two to make one bargain. That angel of a woman, Mrs.
Bassett, has told us all about you. The Witchleys know you,
too; so you had better keep clear from them."</p>

<p>"What!" said I "has that jealous woman been prejudicing
your minds against me, by turning my misfortunes into crimes?"</p>

<p>"Jealous woman!" exclaimed Mrs. Hopton, "jealous
woman! If there ever was a saint upon earth, it is Mrs.
Bassett. She is a perfect angel. But, with such a husband,
who wouldn't be jealous? Well, you may tell the Witchleys
whatever you please; they know you. Everybody is talking
about Tom Pepper's lies. You have got your name up, and it
will be no use for you to attempt to pass yourself off for Mr. St.
Hugh."</p>

<p>"You see you are completely used up, my friend," said the
notary; "but if you observe the directions of my wife and myself,
we will be friends to you, and keep you out of mischief.
Just keep yourself to yourself, and if Witchley should accuse
you of reporting that he had failed, give him no satisfaction, but
send him to me. I will act as your counsel, free of charge."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" said I, indignantly; "I will consent to nothing
that is not true and honest. I shall deny to Mr. Witchley that I
ever reported his having failed."</p>

<p>"Let him do his worst, my dear," said Mrs. Hopton; "nobody
will believe him after the stories I and Mrs. Bassett have told
about him."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

</div>

<p>I RETIRED to my room after getting away from the notary and
his wife, with a melancholy presentiment that I had yet to reap
the blighted harvest of my past transgressions. They had told
me that my name was already a bye-word, and that I should
never be believed again, let me be ever so truthful. The notary
said he had heard a broker say on 'Change, <i>"He lies like Tom
Pepper!</i>" and intimated to me, that since I must bear the name,
it would be as well to enjoy the game of romancing. But this
only made me the more resolute to persevere in telling the truth.
If I could but deny that I had once been called Tom Pepper, I
could establish a reputation for sincerity under the name of St.
Hugh. But that I could not do without violating the pledge I
had made, and being now fairly convinced that no good could
ever result from a falsehood, under any circumstances whatever,
I fortified myself with fresh resolutions to be truthful, and quietly
resigned myself to whatever hardships or trials the future
might have in store for me. Indeed, I had now become so
entirely disgusted with every form of deceit and treachery, that
I could hardly believe that I had ever been guilty of a falsehood;
so easily do we fall into different habits of thought and action,
when we will. I cannot deny that I experienced a certain
degree of pleasure from framing an ingenious falsehood, and
watching its effects upon others, and had prided myself upon my
fancied powers of deception, but I had never known what real
pleasure was, until I had adopted an opposite course, and caused
more surprise by my ingenuous frankness, than I had ever been
able to do by the most ingenious fictions. I have no doubt that
if the greatest romancer in the whole world could be induced to
live with perfect frankness and sincerity, for only one day, he
would become so enamored of the charms and beauty of Truth,
that he would never again sully his soul with a falsehood. But

<!-- Volume I, Page 238 -->

living as all men do in a community where impudent pretension
carries off the rewards to which unpretending merit is entitled,
and where the great art of life is to deceive, none but a very
courageous, or very desperate man could dare to practice such
transparency of thinking and honesty of action as Mr. Bassett
had recommended to me. But I was sufficiently desperate, if
not sufficiently bold, to make the attempt, myself; I had nothing
to lose, and could not change my situation for the worse, as I
thought, let what would happen to me.</p>

<p>Having promised Mr. Bassett that I would do nothing without
first informing him of my intentions, I was compelled to wait until
he called upon me, the next morning, before I could move from
the house. He did not keep me long in suspense, but came to
see me before he went to his store. I was greatly relieved to
learn from him that old Gil had been discharged from confinement,
and that the explanations made by Mr. Bassett had cleared
him from the imputation of any fraudulent design. But the loss
of the forged note fell upon him, because he had been the last
endorser. The woman who had robbed me of my clothes had
also been discharged; but Mr. Bassett told me of another consequence
of my deceit, which gave me still greater uneasiness.
The runaway slave had been seen with the shawl which I gave
her, and had been arrested for stealing it; this led to an explanation
of the manner in which she became possessed of it, by which
means the family of friend Goodwill and Sophia Ruby had been
greatly scandalized by discovering who it was that they had
harbored, under the belief that he was a woman. But the worst
part of the story was that the slave had been found by her owner,
in consequence of the circumstance of her arrest having got into
the papers, and had been taken back into bondage.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, when he had related to me
the last consequences of my romancing, "you have arrived at an
age when it is proper that you should be your own master; your
experiences of life have been varied; you have been well
instructed in the ways of the world; you know the distinctions

<!-- Volume I, Page 239 -->

of good and evil, and if you have strength of character to resist
the temptations to deceive, which, I think, cannot be very powerful
to you, since you have had an opportunity of knowing the
consequences of transgression, you will be in no danger; but if
you have not, it will be in vain for me to attempt to preserve
you."</p>

<p>"Try me," said I, exultingly; "prove me, and if I fall again
I will forfeit all right to your protection or love. But you say
nothing about my Father; I have been afraid to name him to
you, lest all my hopes of seeing him again should be blasted by
your reply. Can you give me no hope?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett looked very solemn, and shook his head, but made
no direct reply to my question.</p>

<p>"Do not give up all hope, my poor boy," said he, taking my
hand and pressing it warmly; "your father was an eccentric
man, and he may have wandered off, as he did when he left
England to seek for your mother, and as no harm has been heard
of him, it is wise to think that he is well, and may return. However,
while you hope that he may return, live as though you
knew that he would not, and that your future fortune depended
upon your own exertions.  It is proper that you should earn
your own support, or at least that you should be capable of doing
it; for I have consulted with a lawyer, and find that you cannot
establish your claim as heir to the estate of the St. Hughs;
unfortunately for you, the evidence requisite to prove your
identity, and the legitimacy of your birth, is in the possession of
your father; therefore it would be idle to make the attempt, or
to nurse the idea that you will one day occupy so proud a station
as you would have been entitled to, had you been true to yourself,
nor lost that great inheritance by your follies. It would be
wrong in me to encourage you to expect any essential aid from
my property; my business is precarious&mdash;the accidents of trade
may reduce me to the condition of a beggar, and then the hardship
of earning your daily bread would be greater than it can be
now."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 240 -->

<p>I had listened in silence thus far, but now my heart swelled
with pride at the thought of relying solely upon my own exertions
for my support, and I said:</p>

<p>"You have laid me under fresh obligations by this frankness;
I am no longer a boy, and I will eat the bread of dependence no
more. Hereafter, then, I am free."</p>

<p>"No, not free," said Mr. Bassett; "I have your promise that
you will do nothing without my knowledge, if not without my
consent. This promise I shall not release you from. In all
other things you are free to act as you see fit; I may advise you,
but I shall never insist upon your following my advice. But
you shall not go into the world to seek your fortune empty
handed; here is a check for five hundred dollars, which will be
sufficient for all your wants until you can earn something for
yourself."</p>

<p>My first impulse as to reject the offered check; but I knew
it was offered in kindness, and I would not seem to repel his
friendship. I was offended, however, or rather my feelings were
hurt, by his offer and his altered manner towards me, and it did
not agree with my new resolution to keep a clean breast, not to
tell him of it, so I said:</p>

<p>"I will accept the money, but I am hurt by your manner of
offering it. I see that your feelings are changed towards me,
and I fear that you are already tired of me, and wish to be rid
of me."</p>

<p>"Now, that is well done, Tom," said Mr. Bassett; "I like
you better for saying what you think. You will know better
one of these days than to be offended with one who tries to do
you a kindness. Keep the money, and make a good use of it;
but do not expect to receive more from me."</p>

<p>"No, I will not&mdash;I do not," I replied, hardly able to speak.
"I feel your kindness and thank you; I will try to prove worthy
of the confidence you have had in me, and of the love which I
once thought you bore for me. I can never, while my name is
St. Hugh, disgrace it."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 241 -->

<p>"But your name is not St. Hugh yet," said Mr. Bassett;
"you do not know that you are entitled to it; therefore you must
still call yourself by your old name, until you establish your
claim to better one. You must remain Tom Pepper, as you
were before you supposed that your name was St. Hugh."</p>

<p>"This is the hardest lot of all," said I; "how shall I ever
be able to make way against the bad reputation of my former
name? It has become a proverb, I hear that great liars
are called Tom Peppers; who will ever trust me, with such a
reputation, or how shall I ever succeed in earning my living
with such a name?"</p>

<p>"You have a hard task before you, Tom; but you have no
one to blame for it but yourself. Had you followed my advice,
you would now be in a very different condition."</p>

<p>I saw that Mr. Bassett had resolutely set his heart against
me, and had no doubt that he had been influenced by some person
who was an enemy to me. So I made no other reply to
him, than simply to tell him, that I hoped he would have no
cause to regret his goodness to me, and that I would strive to
repay him the aid he had given me. But he told me that all he
had done for me was a free gift on his part, and that I must
never think about returning it.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," said he, as he rose to go, "I shall leave you to
follow the bent of your own inclinations; choose your own
employments, your own companions, and your own residence;
but remember that you are to do nothing without first informing
me of your intentions. You promise me this?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"He then squeezed my hand, and without saying another word,
left me to my own reflections, which were bitter enough. As he
closed the door, I fell upon the sofa and wept. I felt utterly
desolate and broken hearted. I had not, now, a friend in the
world, and knew not whither to turn in search of one. It was
very evident that  Mr. Bassett had no hope of ever hearing from
my father again, and that he was disgusted with my former conduct,

<!-- Volume I, Page 242 -->

and was growing tired of me. He had said nothing of his
wife, but I attributed the change in his conduct mainly to her,
for I knew that she still exercised a strong influence over him,
notwithstanding that he knew how little she deserved his love, or
even respect. My first care, now, was to get the money for my
check, and for that purpose I went down into Wall street as soon
as I had done weeping, and having got my money, I felt rather
more confident in myself. I could not be utterly cast down
with five hundred dollars in my pocket, and feeling myself more
like myself, I went boldly into old Gil's place, partly with the
hope of being invited to take my old place, and partly to ask his
pardon for deceiving him. The old fellow sat at his desk, alone,
as I entered, and as soon as he looked up and saw me, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Leave my office, Grimshaw! I won't have you here!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said I, coolly; "not until I have asked your pardon
for the wrong I did you."</p>

<p>"The wrong you did me?" exclaimed old Gil, throwing his
hat on the floor with violence, "what's the good of your asking
my pardon for that? Will it bring back my money to me that
you helped to swindle me out of? When you can do that, then
come and ask my pardon, and perhaps I will pardon you. But
until you do, I don't want to see you."</p>

<p>The old broker looked more slovenly than usual, his white
cravat as twisted more on one side than ever, and the knot
stuck up more prominently behind his left ear; the tobacco juice
that ran down from the corners of his mouth was unusually
copious and black; his eyes were heavier, his shaggy hair,
shaggier, and his trowsers more than ever down about his heels.
It was evident that old Gil's mind had been unusually occupied,
and that he bestowed less thought than ever before, upon his
mere making-up, if that were possible, for he had never bestowed
any particular attention upon his personal appearance.</p>

<p>"My name is not Grimshaw," I said, "nor Walter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you are no longer a Quaker; you put on a drab suit to

<!-- Volume I, Page 243 -->

deceive me, and now you have come with some new lie to me.
But it won't do, Grimshaw; I am not to be taken in the second
time. So, go about your business, if you have any; I can't
attend to you. I don't want to see you."</p>

<p>"You must hear me out before I go," said I, standing with my
back against the door. "No, I am not a Quaker; I never was
one, and I deceived you by wearing the dress of one; neither
am I an Englishman, by birth; I never saw Lancashire, and all
the people whose names I used to talk about, were inventions,
and nothing else."</p>

<p>"You are a greater liar than Tom Pepper," said he.</p>

<p>"No, I am not," I replied, while my cheeks burned with
shame; "I am Tom Pepper himself."</p>

<p>"You, Tom Pepper!" exclaimed he, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "I am that unfortunate boy; or, rather, I was.
But I am a different Tom Pepper now."</p>

<p>"Ha! Then I see how it is; you have come to me with more
lies; but you may clear out. I don't want to see your face.
You have swindled me out of my money. Go! go!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it," I replied; "is there no way that I can
satisfy you of my sincerity?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he; "pay me my money. Did I not tell you at
first, that it was against my principles to give something for
nothing? Do you think I will give you my confidence and forgiveness
in return for the deception you practiced on me, and for
aiding some one to swindle me out of my money? And remember,
Grimshaw, that you did all this after I had taken you into
my house, and made you a companion of my daughters."</p>

<p>"I confess all, and mean to convince you how sincerely I
regret my past conduct. I am changed from what I was."</p>

<p>"You are changed, are you?" said he, sneeringly. "You
have experienced religion, perhaps, and had a change of heart?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing like that," I replied: "but still I am changed.
I will never tell another untruth."</p>

<p>"But that will not bring back my money, will it?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 244 -->

<p>"Yes; for I will earn it and pay you."</p>

<p>"No, Grimshaw," said he, "you will never earn three
thousand dollars; and if you do, you will not have the honesty
to pay me."</p>

<p>I felt indignant at the old man's persisting in doubting my
honesty, and remembering the money that I had in my pocket, I
took it out, and counting it deliberately, reached it to him and
said:</p>

<p>"There, take the first instalment of your debt. It is all I
possess, and when I get more I will bring it to you."</p>

<p>The old man's countenance brightened up at the sight of the
bills, and very much to my disappointment, he clutched them, and
thrust them into his pocket. </p>

<p>"I will give you a receipt for the amount," said old Gil, sitting
down to his dusty desk.</p>

<p>But I told him I would take no receipt. All my debts should
be debts of honor.</p>

<p>"Well, Grimshaw," said he, "when will you pay another
instalment?"</p>

<p>"I may never pay another," I said, "and you may never see
me again. Good bye to you and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was going to say, "to Pauline," but my heart failed me.
I turned to leave, when old Gil called me back.</p>

<p>"Grimshaw," said he, "have you given me all your money?"</p>

<p>"All," said I, "but a trifle of change."</p>

<p>"I won't take everything from you; keep fifty dollars; you
may want it."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I will not take a dollar. What right have I to it,
when you have lost six times the amount that I gave you, by my
dishonesty?"</p>

<p>"Grimshaw, come back! Come back you crazy boy!"
old Gil exclaimed, as I left his office. But I did not go back,
for the old man had insulted me, and I would receive no favor
from him. It was a great satisfaction to me to have made a confession
to him, and to have partly discharged my obligation to

<!-- Volume I, Page 245 -->

him. My next desire was to see Pauline, and confess to her;
then I had resolved to call upon Mrs. Ruby and the Quakers, and
make a clean breast to them, that I might no longer have any
excuse for deception of any kind. I wanted that all with whom
I had had any intercourse under an assumed name, should know
me now as Tom Pepper, that they might know who I was, and
what they had a right to expect from me. I could undertake no
new employment until all these matters were disposed of; so I
hurried back to my lodgings from old Gil's office, and sat down
to think over my plans. I had not been in my chamber many
minutes, before I received a call from Mrs. Nicely, who began
to open her business to me in quite a diplomatic manner, talking
first of the weather, then of my health, then of the price of
provisions, the difficulties which "widow ladies" had to encounter,
who attempted to earn an honest living; the plague of servants,
the dearness of house-rent, and the impossibility of satisfying
everybody&mdash;by which she meant her boarders. Then she
hinted at the high opinion she had formed of me, and plainly said
that she had told one of her family that she knew from my looks,
that I was not only a real gentleman, but that I was the most
obliging soul in the world.</p>

<p>I trembled to hear Mrs. Nicely express so high an opinion of
my obliging disposition, for I suspected that she wanted to put it
to a severer test than it would bear; and such proved to be the
case, for she presently came to the point and said that she was
very much in want of money, and would be much obliged to me
if I could pay her a month's board in advance.</p>

<p>"My dear madam," said I, "I have not a dollar in the world,
and so far from paying you a month in advance for my board, it
is probable that I shall not have it in my power to pay you even
at the end of a month."</p>

<p>In all my experience of the world, nothing has so much astonished
me as its unfathomable hypocrisy, and the easy transitions
which some people make from the most artful disguises to the
most naked exposure of themselves.  Ever since I had been a

<!-- Volume I, Page 246 -->

member of Mrs. Nicely's establishment, she had treated me with
unbounded respect, she had smiled upon me always, so broadly
as to expose the fastenings of her false teeth, and manifested an
interest in my health that quite captivated my affections; but
no sooner did she hear my confession of poverty than her countenance
instantly changed from an expression of smiling respect
to a look of cold contempt, and her bland voice became a shrill
scream, as she said:</p>

<p>"It's just what I expected of you. I knew you were an
imposter, from the beginning; Mrs. Hopton told me to look out
for you. But I don't believe you. You have got plenty of
money, for Mr. Bassett told me he had given you sufficient to
pay your board for six months. But you wanted to cheat a poor
widow out of her money. Yes, you are a nice young man.
You wanted to live at my expense, and occupy my best room,
and then go off without paying me. But I have caught, you,
Mr. Pepper; you can't deceive me with your lies; I know all
about you. Goodness knows that it is difficult enough for a
poor widow lady, like me, with nobody in the world but herself
to depend upon, to get along, and go to market every morning
with cash in hand; and beef at fourteen pence a pound, and the
baker's loaves getting smaller and smaller every day. Haven't
I been giving you the best of coffee? no mixture with rye; and
butter two-and-three a pound. I tell you what it is, Mr. Pepper,
I can't stand it. I must have my room. You are a pretty
young fellow, to pretend that you have got no money, and want
to cheat a poor widow lady. You are nice young man, Mr.
Pepper; now, take my advice, and give up telling stories; but I
can't keep you in my establishment, for my family are all gentlemen
and ladies of the first respectability; they are professors
of religion, too, sir, and I can't introduce them to anybody that
tells such dreadful stories."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, interrupting her, "you are like the rest of the
world; you have no other standard of merit than money. Well, I
don't blame you. I tell you, truly, that I have got no money,

<!-- Volume I, Page 247 -->

and as I cannot pay you, I will not stay in your house.  But, do
not be alarmed; I will pay all my debts by and bye."</p>

<p>I left the room immediately, and found all the ladies of the
house assembled in the hall, where they had been attracted by
Mrs. Nicely's screams. I passed them without speaking, and
my disgust was greatly heightened by seeing Mrs. Hopton and
Maria Witchley standing with their arms around each other's
neck. I was happily unencumbered with baggage of any kind,
my trunk being still at old Gil's house, and I walked off and left
Mrs. Nicely's genteel establishment without any feelings of
regret but from being unable to discharge my obligations to her
for my board. It was near the dinner hour of the Goodwills,
and as I had not called upon these excellent people to thank
them for their kindness to me, and to beg their pardon for the
gross deceptions I had practiced upon their good nature, I made
my way to their house, and fortunately found them at dinner,
with Sophia Ruby in their midst. The servant ushered me into
the basement, where they were at dinner, without announcing my
name.</p>

<p>"How does thee do, friend?" said the old Quaker, as I
entered, "hast thee any business with me?"</p>

<p>"Not with you in particular, said I, "but with all of you. Do
none of you recognize me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed Desire, dropping her knife and fork, "it is
Sarah!"</p>

<p>"Sarah!" exclaimed Wilson, "why father, it is!"</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," said Mrs. Ruby; "the tones of her voice
thrilled through my frame," and, rising from her seat, this pure-hearted
lady took me by the hand, and smiling upon me very
sweetly, said she was most happy to see me once more. Wilson
was somewhat confused in his looks, but friend Goodwill and his
wife showed no emotion at all, but invited me kindly to sit by,
and partake of their dinner. They were all very kind to me,
and refrained from making any allusion to my first appearance
among them, which affected me so sensibly that I could scarce

<!-- Volume I, Page 248 -->

refrain from tears; the whole tone of their conduct was so different
from that of other people with whom I had come in contact
since I had left them. They did not call me by any name, not
knowing how to address me. Wilson and his sister were somewhat
abashed, but their parents and Mrs. Ruby did not seem
to notice their confusion. When dinner was over, I said:</p>

<p>"I have come to tell you who I am, and to beg your pardon
for deceiving you."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion to beg our pardons," said friend Goodwill;
"thou did us no harm. We meant well to thee; and if
thou deceived us, thou didst harm to thyself, and must ask pardon
of One above us all."</p>

<p>"Friend Goodwill speaks my mind, too," said Mrs. Ruby;
"in trying to serve you, we were but discharging our duty, and
we therefore want no thanks. But if you wanted to explain to
us the motive you had in assuming so strange a disguise, we will
be happy to listen to it."</p>

<p>"Not unless thou wishes to do it for thy own sake. Thou art
under no obligation to us," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Perhaps our friend will be glad to do it," said Wilson.</p>

<p>"I feel bound to do it," said I; "it was an accident that led
me to put on the disguise of a woman's dress, and I am desirous
of telling my story to you, for I have begun to lead a new life,
and mean that all who have ever known me shall know my true
history, that no one may be deceived in me hereafter."</p>

<p>On hearing this, they looked at me more earnestly than they
had done before, and I told them who and what I was, and all
the adventures that had happened to me up to that moment.
They all listened to me very attentively; excepting friend Goodwill
himself, who fell asleep directly after I began to recount my
history, and awoke just as I concluded it.</p>

<p>"Thou hast lost something decidedly rich, father," said Wilson;
"I doubt whether thy dreams have been so strange as the
story which friend Pepper has been telling."</p>

<p>"I shall lose nothing by it," said his father, "for Sophia

<!-- Volume I, Page 249 -->

Ruby will write it all off for one of the magazines, and then I
can read it at my leisure."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ruby confessed that she had been very much interested
in my story, and thought that she discovered in me the germ
of a great principle that lay very close to her heart, and would
be glad if I would call at her house, and relate it to her again,
that she might commit it to paper. But Desire lifted up her soft
eyes, and said she thought it would be better for me to call at
her father's house again, and let Sophia Ruby take her notes
there, as she was herself desirous to hear me repeat the story.
Mrs. Ruby said that she could only write in the seclusion of her
own study, and would prefer that I should call upon her at her
own house as she would like to ask me some questions that I
might feel a delicacy in answering if there were a third person
present. Friend Goodwill reminded them that I might object to
calling to see either of them again, and they would do well to
leave me to act as I thought proper.</p>

<p>Having once spent the day with Mrs. Ruby, I was obliged to
tell her that I did not like to call upon her at her lodgings again,
but that I would gladly meet her according to the suggestion of
Desire. This was probably rude, but it was sincere; I thought
myself bound to speak the truth, and I was extremely astonished
to discover, that so great an admirer of truth and plain speaking
as Sophia Ruby, should take offence at my candor, for she said:</p>

<p>"Upon the whole, I  would rather not  hear your story again.
I perceived that it was not true at first, and I am now convinced
that you have not got so bad a name for nothing."</p>

<p>"But, if the young man is so prone to falsehood, Sophia,"
said friend Goodwill, "thou must have the more charity for him,
and teach him by kindness to love truth and candor."</p>

<p>"I think it is a very bad symptom," said Mrs. Ruby, "when
such young people give themselves airs, and talk about likings
and dislikings. He has evidently no fondness for the beautiful,
and looks only upon the outward, without any feelings for the
infinite. Such people have their spheres of action, but they are

<!-- Volume I, Page 250 -->

so far removed from the inward sense, that I can never approach
them, but to relieve them."</p>

<p>It was quite out of the question for me to make any reply to
Mrs. Ruby, because I could not form the most remote idea of her
meaning. But I saw that I had displeased her by my sincerity,
so I told her that I had spoken nothing but the truth, and if it
was offensive to her, I regretted it, but should, nevertheless continue
to speak my mind plainly and without reserve, and let the
consequences take care of themselves.</p>

<p>"Thou art right," said Desire; and then, as if frightened at
her boldness, she blushed deeply, and said no more.</p>

<p>This sweet young lady had never appeared more beautiful, or
bewitchingly innocent, and she almost made me forget that
charming creature, Pauline Gilson. But Pauline had made an
impression upon my heart by the artless confession of her love
for me, or, at least, by making a confession that I interpreted in
that manner, and I resolutely set myself against the encroachments
of Desire's quiet blandishments. Mrs. Ruby showed her
feelings so plainly, that the rest of the family appeared quite
uneasy at my presence, so I rose to go, when Desire again said:</p>

<p>"Thou will call again, friend Pepper?"</p>

<p>"Stop one moment," said Wilson; "there are thy garments, which
thou left in my bed-room; perhaps they will be of service
to thee again."</p>

<p>"Wilson!" said the father, giving him a reproving look.</p>

<p>"No," said I;  "I shall never need them again. I have
worn my last disguise. Good bye to you all," and, quite unconsciously,
I took the hand of Desire and kissed it, which caused
Mrs. Ruby to frown on me with a harsher expression than I supposed
her countenance capable of wearing.</p>

<p>It was towards dusk when I left the house of the Goodwills,
and as it was necessary that I should find another boarding-house,
I had to tell Mr. Bassett of the change in my affairs,
according to the promise I had made him, I started directly for
his store, hoping to reach there before he left for home. While

<!-- Volume I, Page 251 -->

walking rapidly across the Park, my attention was arrested by a
noise behind me of some men quarrelling, and suddenly turning
my head, I saw at a short distance a person walking towards
me, who resembled my father so nearly, that I was sure it was
Captain St. Hugh. He stopped as I turned my head, and immediately
began to walk in an opposite direction but his gait and
dress were so nearly like Captain St. Hugh's that I as startled
by the resemblance, and determined to follow him and speak to
him. I ran towards him, but being obstructed for a minute by a
crowd of boys who had collected around the men whose quarrelling
had attracted my attention, the gentlemen passed out of the
middle Park gate before I could get near him. It was just at
that hour of the day when the crowd is greatest in Broadway,
and as he turned into the street I lost sight of him, and could
not discover whether he turned up or down. I was uncertain
which way to proceed, but I first ran up the street a few blocks,
looking in the face of every person I met, and then ran down,
but without catching another glimpse of the mysterious apparition.
An accidental resemblance to my father would have been
nothing strange, although he was a man of very marked character,
and quite peculiar in his dress, but what surprised me most
was the evident wish of the person whom I had seen to avoid me.</p>

<p>If it had been Captain St. Hugh, he surely would not have
avoided me; but then I was not certain that he had observed
me; it was between daylight and dark, and he might have
turned and gone in an opposite direction to that which he was
following when I caught sight of him, to avoid the crowd; but,
if it were really Captain St. Hugh, Mr. Bassett must know of
his being in the city, and I ran as fast as I could to his store, to
tell him what I had seen, but he had been gone an hour, and I
followed him to his house, where I found him at his supper. I
was so breathless that I could hardly tell the servant my name,
but Mr. Bassett was so long in making his appearance that I had
abundant time to become perfectly cool and composed. He met
me very cordially, as usual, but excused himself for not asking

<!-- Volume I, Page 252 -->

me to come in, on amount of his having company. When I told
him that I was certain I had met Captain St. Hugh, he said it
was quite natural for me to think so, that nothing was more easy
than for me to be mistaken, and that I must not allow myself to
think that I should ever see my father again.</p>

<p>It was a great damper to my excited feelings to be met so
coldly by Mr. Bassett, who evidently had no expectation of hearing
from Captain St. Hugh again, and I was about to leave him
without telling him of my destitute condition, when he asked me
how I had disposed of myself during the day. On hearing that
I had left my boarding-house, and the cause of it, he appeared
displeased, and said:</p>

<p>"I am surprised that Mr. Gilson should accept your money,
but I am not that you should offer it. Be careful hereafter,
Tom, and never do so thoughtless an act again."</p>

<p>"It was not thoughtless," I replied; "I had no right to keep
money in my pocket while I was indebted to him for a loss which
he had suffered by my ill conduct."</p>

<p>"That is very right, Tom," said he, "but you must learn to
be just to yourself before you are just to others."</p>

<p>"You used to tell me," I said, "that the surest way of doing
myself justice, would be to act justly towards others."</p>

<p>"True, Tom; true. Perhaps I am wrong. Here is more
money, go provide yourself a home, and keep clear from old
Gil, or he will have it from you. Remember your promise to
me, and do nothing without informing me of it. Good night."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE was a change in the manner of Mr. Bassett, which distressed
me. He so evidently wished to be rid of me, that, had I
not promised to keep him informed of all my movements, I
should have been tempted to leave him forever, and seek my fortune

<!-- Volume I, Page 253 -->

where I could find it. Why he should manifest so great
an interest in my welfare as to keep me supplied with money,
and exact a promise from me not to make any changes in my
way of life without informing him of it, puzzled me exceedingly,
for he seemed to care nothing about me, while he watched over
me as carefully as though he had been my own father. But I
was sure of one thing: I knew that his motives were good, let
his designs be what they might; in all my familiarities with
him he had never discovered an ungenerous, nor an improper
feeling. I felt myself secure in his keeping from all sinister
designs, and was confident that he would never turn my confessions
to my own harm.</p>

<p>I did not look at the money which he gave me until after I had
left him, when I found, upon examining it, that it amounted to
one hundred dollars in small bank-bills, which I put in my pocket,
and having no fears about finding a boarding house to my liking,
I determined to seek for an interview with Pauline. I had no
hope of being admitted to her father's house, but I remembered
that it was the evening on which old Gil attended the weekly
prayer-meeting of his church, and I knew that he always took
one or two of his daughters with him; so I resolved to go to the
lecture room where the prayer-meetings were held, in the hope
of seeing Pauline&mdash;for I not only had a great desire to see her,
but I was most anxious to know whether she would continue to
look upon me with favor, now that she knew of my guilt. I
reached the church in which old Gil worshipped, after the hour
of meeting, and going into the basement room where they were
assembled together, found the whole congregation on their knees,
or rather part were on their knees, while others sat with their
heads resting on the backs of the benches. I had never been in
the room before, and was quite surprised at its dimensions and
the number of devout people engaged in prayer. A gentleman
stood in the midst of them praying very loud, whom I recognized
as a broker in Wall street, who had extensive dealings with old
Gil, and I could not help thinking that it must be a great comfort
to them to meet together on neutral ground and offer up prayers

<!-- Volume I, Page 254 -->

for the conversion of the heathen&mdash;the special object of the
meeting&mdash;after having done their utmost during the day to get
the better of each other in their money transactions.</p>

<p>The interest which this gentleman expressed in the welfare
of the heathen, considering the slight degree of interest which he
took in the welfare of anybody else, was really surprising, and I
listened with great astonishment to his earnest supplications
in their behalf, for I had never before suspected him of being
pious, or caring about anybody but himself. I looked round
anxiously among the dense audience, but I could see no one who
reminded me of Pauline. When the prayer was done, however,
I discovered that lovely girl sitting in a pew by the side of her
father, who, being called upon by the pastor, after a hymn had
been sung, stood up and began to pray in the most fervent manner,
for nearly every barbarous tribe on earth, naming them all
by name, lest any should chance to escape a blessing through
his neglect in not commending them to the divine favor. I was
familiar with old Gil's style of praying to be so much overcome
by his fervor as to forget the object of my visit; and as
soon as he seemed to be fairly engaged with the Tartars and
Japanese, for whom he always manifested a more lively regard
than for any other heathenish people, I stole on tip-toe to his
pew, and watched for an opportunity when he changed his position
to glide behind him and seat myself by the side of Pauline,
who was not kneeling, but her head was resting on a hymn-book
which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>This was a most difficult feat, for old Gil's burly figure nearly
filled up the entrance of his pew; but he happened to rest himself
against the back of the bench in front of him, when I
stepped upon the seat of his own pew, and in a moment sat down
by the side of Pauline. It was done so rapidly and so lightly,
that she did not perceive me until I bent down my head and whispered
softly in her ear, "Pauline!"</p>

<p>She started, but discovering at once who it was, again bent
down her head and whispered sweetly,</p>

<p>"Is it you, Walter?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 255 -->

<p>I took hold of her hand and pressed it, and she pressed mine
in return, which sent a thrill of delight through me that I had
never known before.</p>

<p>Her father had by this time got through with the Japanese, and
was fast drawing towards the subjects of the Soultan, with
whom he usually closed his prayer, after barely mentioning Madagascar
and the undiscovered parts of Africa; and as I had but
a few moments to stay by the side of Pauline before I retreated,
I requested her in a low whisper to meet me outside of the church
door at the close of the meeting.</p>

<p>She gave my hand another slight squeeze, by way of reply,
and I managed to slip past her father and regain the seat I had
occupied just as he pronounced his Amen. I was compelled to
sit and listen to three more long prayers, which, I hope, had their
intended effect, but as I have never heard of a second Pentecost,
either in Asia or Africa, I fear that those long prayers never had
any particular influence with the Ruler of the Universe; and as
I never knew old Gil to express any astonishment at the non-fulfilment
of his most generous aspirations for the heathen, I have
been almost tempted to believe that he had no great faith in the
efficacy of his own prayers, himself.</p>

<p>After the prayers were at an end the audience sung a dismal
hymn, and then the pastor made a short exhortation; after this,
he pronounced a benediction, and the meeting was dismissed. I
did not wait to receive the full benefit of the blessing, but stole
quietly up stairs, where I waited in the shadow of the porch with
great anxiety for Pauline to appear. By-and-bye she came out
by the side of her father, and while he turned to shake hands
with somebody in the crowd, I caught hold of her arm and she
followed me without hesitation. I put my arm round her waist,
and before either of us had spoken a word, pressed my lips to hers
in a warm, delicious kiss. This was a sufficient prelude to anything
that might follow, but I still felt some embarrassment about
addressing her. She did not wait for me to speak, but directly
began to question me respecting my absence.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 256 -->

<p>"Dear Walter," said she, "I began to fear that you had gone
back to England, and that we should never hear of you again.
My father has told us the strangest stories about you, which I
did not believe, of course. You know, Walter, that I would
never believe any harm of you. But you are so changed in
your dress! What is the meaning of it all, Walter, and why
did you leave us so strangely? But you shall not tell me. No,
you shall make no explanation to me, because I know that you
have done nothing wrong. But it was cruel of you, Walter, to
leave me so long, and not tell me where you were. And now I
remember; I am offended with you, and had promised my sisters
not to speak to you when you did come back, for treating us so
badly."</p>

<p>Pauline continued to declare that I had forfeited her esteem,
she said nothing about love, by going off so abruptly, and that
her sisters would never speak to me again, but she leaned more
heavily upon my arm, and when I again enclosed her in a tender
embrace, she made but a feeble opposition. When I had
heard all her complaints, which, so far from giving me the
slightest displeasure, afforded me unspeakable delight, because I
knew that they evinced the strength of her love for me, I related
to her the cause of my leaving her father's employment, and all
the particulars of my history up to that moment. It was a bright
moonlight night, the air was still and warm, the streets were
nearly deserted, and we had walked slowly along in the deep
shadows of the tall houses quite unconscious whither our steps
led us, until we found ourselves beneath the trees of St. John's
Park, and were suddenly startled by the gurgling and splashing
of the fountain in the centre of that beautiful, but unfashionable
square. The gates of the Park were locked, but I happened to
have a key in my pocket, which Mrs. Nicely had lent me in the
morning, for all the tenants in the square enjoyed the high
privilege of walking in the enclosure, from which all the rest of
the world were excluded. So I unlocked the gate, and we
walked in, and to prevent intrusion, locked it on the inside. It

<!-- Volume I, Page 257 -->

was delicious to ramble round among the flowering shrubbery of
that retired spot, on such a night, and listen to the falling waters
of the fountain, and watch it waving in the moonlight, like a
white spirit just resting upon the earth, and seeming continually
to rise from it. But these were nothing to me then; indeed, I
scarcely heeded the fountain, or the perfume of the flowers, or
the dark foliage of the trees. Pauline was something better than
all; her breath was sweeter than the flowers, her form more
graceful than the fountain, and her voice softer than the gentlest
whisper of the evening breeze. If I had been created for the
sole enjoyment of that hour, and if in reaching it my trials and
sufferings had all been doubled, I would have blessed God for
his bounty, and thought that my life had not been created in
vain. We walked in silence for some moments after I had
closed my narrative, with our arms round each other's waists,
and our hands warmly clasped together, feeling the palpitation
of each other's hearts, and each waiting for the other to speak.</p>

<p>There is a pretty little rustic summer-house, with benches, in
the middle of the Park, and when we came near it, I said;</p>

<p>"Let us sit down, Pauline, and rest ourselves."</p>

<p>She made no resistance, but sat down, when I again pressed
her in my arms and kissed her beautiful mouth. It is a foolish
thing, no doubt, for one man to kneel to another, but there can
be no harm in kneeling to the woman whom you love, when
your feelings prompt such an act, to show your complete subjection
to her will. Without thinking anything about it, I fell
upon my knees before Pauline, and said:</p>

<p>"Dear Pauline, you have heard my story; you know who I
am; how base I have been; how unworthy I am to be loved by
one so pure as yourself; you know how I have wronged your
father&mdash;how he despises me, and the little hope I can have of his
ever forgiving me for the harm I did him. But, Pauline, though
I am so unworthy of being loved by you, I cannot help loving
you. Can you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter, I can; and I cannot help it. Rise&mdash;you distress

<!-- Volume I, Page 258 -->

me by kneeling to me. It may be that you are unworthy
of me, for, dear Walter, I will not disguise the truth. I have
heard stranger stories told about you than those you have told of
yourself. I know what my father thinks of you, and my mother,
and my sisters. They say that you have brought disgrace upon
our family by having been the means of my father's imprisonment;
but still, Walter, I do love you, and I feel myself more
unworthy of you than you can be of me. Perhaps we are unworthy
of each other, and so let our unworthiness be a bond of
sympathy to us."</p>

<p>"Darling, darling Pauline!" I exclaimed with rapture, "and
would you, if compelled to choose between your father and me,
choose to share my disgrace even at the expense of his displeasure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Walter, a thousand and a thousand times!" said she,
resting her head upon my shoulder to hide her burning blushes.</p>

<p>"Then, darling," said I, "let us never part again. Will you
marry me?"</p>

<p>"When?" said Pauline.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;to-night;" said I, again pressing her in my arms,
"and we will never again be separated."</p>

<p>"Dear Walter!" said Pauline.</p>

<p>"You must not call me Walter any more," said I, as we rose
from the bench and walked out upon the path that led to the gate,
"but Tom."</p>

<p>"Well, I will not call you Walter; neither will I call you
Tom," said Pauline. "but I will call you Love."</p>

<p>"And I will call you Darling," said I. And so we came out
of the Park together; and crossed over to a house in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go in here, darling," said I, as I pulled the
door-bell.</p>

<p>"Go in there!" said she; "for what, Love?"</p>

<p>"To be married," I replied; "this is a clergyman's house."</p>

<p>"Dear Love!" exclaimed Pauline, grasping my arm tightly,
"you are not in earnest?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 259 -->

<p>The door was now opened by a servant, who replied to my
inquiry that the doctor was at home, in his study, and invited us
into the parlor. We sat down, and the doctor made his appearance
in a few minutes, in his slippers and robe-de-chambre.
Having heard the object of our visit, he said: "Very well;
wait until I put on my gown." He then stepped out, and
returned again with a prayer-book in his hand, and wearing his
gown instead of his robe-de-chambre. He was accompanied by
a black servant, who brought in two candles. The doctor asked
our names, and whether our parents knew that we mere going to
be married; remarked that it was an unusually late hour, and
cautioned us against entering into the holy state of matrimony
without first duly considering the solemn consequences of such
an act. I told him that we had weighed the matter well and
seriously, and were bent upon being united immediately, and if
he had any objections to performing the ceremony, we should
adjourn to the house of the Mayor or the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Well, my young friends, said the Doctor, "it is an affair
of your own, and I dare say you are better able to judge what
is good for you than I am. I have married many a couple in this
room, and God forbid that I should keep asunder those whom He
designs to unite in wedlock. It is a good thing to be married; I
have tried it myself three times, and have never had cause to repent
of it; but I must tell you, my young friends, that people do
sometimes make dreadful mistakes that way. However, that is
no business of mine. If you will be married, why I suppose you
must be. Stand up, and it will soon be over. You of course
know whether there are any impediments to you being united or
not?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said I, "we love each other very much,
and mean never to be parted again."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said the Doctor, opening his prayer-book,
"that sounds very well; all I hope is that you will tell the same
story a twelvemonth hence:&mdash;Dearly beloved, I require and
charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment,

<!-- Volume I, Page 260 -->

when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed,) that if either
of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully
joined," etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Doctor was proceeding very rapidly, and in another minute
I should have been irrevocably married, when I suddenly remembered
my promise to Mr. Bassett, and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!"</p>

<p>Pauline turned pale with fright, and the Doctor, letting fall his
prayer-book, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it, my friend! Anything wrong in the service?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong," said I, "but I cannot be married;
I have a promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>On hearing this, Pauline nearly fainted, and if I had not
caught her in my arms she would have fallen. I explained to the
Doctor the nature of my promise, and told him that we
could come back the next night and have the ceremony finished.</p>

<p>"Very well, my young friend," said the Doctor, "just as you
please. Call at any time, and I shall be happy to serve you; as
I have only gone through half the ceremony, you may pay me
half the sum that you expected to give for the whole."</p>

<p>It so happened that I had not expected to give anything; the
necessity of paying for being married had not occurred to me. I
told the Doctor that I had not intended to give him anything, and
asked him if he would take offence at five dollars.</p>

<p>"O, not the least in the world," said he, taking the bill which
I reached him and examining it with his eye-glass to see if it was
a good one.</p>

<p>It was too late now to call upon Mr. Bassett and inform him of my
matrimonial intentions, so that we were a good deal perplexed to
know what to do; but Pauline thought it advisable for her to return
home, and promised to meet me the next evening at particular
place near her father's house. I accompanied her home,
when we parted very unwillingly and with many protestations of
fidelity and undying love. It was a sad disappointment to me,
but it was unavoidable, and I looked forward to our next meeting

<!-- Volume I, Page 261 -->

with unqualified delight. Just as I parted from Pauline, a tall
gentleman came out of her father's house, and before I could
avoid his seeing me, he peered into my face and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aw! how do you do, Grimshaw? How aw you this evening,
my deaw fellow!"</p>

<p>"I am but indifferently well," I replied, for I not only felt ill
from my disappointment, but I had a particular aversion to the
tall gentleman, and wished to be alone.</p>

<p>"Aw! But perhaps you do not recognize me. It is Mr.
Pilfor. You know that I sometimes accompany the Misses
Gilson with my flute."</p>

<p>"I know who you are," I replied.</p>

<p>"O, you do. Well, it's quite delightful to meet you. I will
walk down Broadway with you, my deaw fellow. I will have
some talk with you, and some oysters."</p>

<p>I knew Mr. Pilfor too well to think of escaping from him. He
was one of those persevering gentlemen, who make up their
minds never to take no for an answer under any circumstances.
They have no conception of such a thing as a negative, unless,
indeed, it be according to the rule of Lindley Murray, that two
negatives make an affirmative. Two denials they construe as
an acquiescence. At least this was the way with Mr. Pilfor, and
when I twice declined the pleasure of his company, he took me
by the arm, and said;</p>

<p>"Come along, my deaw fellow; come along."</p>

<p>Mr. Pilfor was a lawyer, of course; such kind of fellows always
are. He had been an <i>attache</i> of a lawyer's office a certain
number of years, but he devoted his talents chiefly to the fine arts,
and cultivated music and poetry in particular. He talked no
end of German, French, and Italian, and was not ignorant of
anything. He acknowledged one weakness, which was Sebastian
Bach&mdash;a name that he pronounced <i>Bawk</i>. He was very
tall, had excessively black hair, and a fierce beard and moustache.
His face was pale, and his teeth fair, as he took pains to let the
world know by displaying them all he could. He wore a Marseilles

<!-- Volume I, Page 262 -->

vest, a damask rose in the button-hole of his coat, and a
diamond stud. He wore a broad brim hat because he thought it
gave him a <i>recherche</i> look, and lisped when he talked because it
sounded genteel. I had seen him two or three times at old Gil's,
who had an unmitigable dislike to him, as he had to the entire
tribe to which he belonged, and had been at no pains to disguise
his feelings; but Mr. Pilfor was not the man to regard such
things; he was either too well used to them, or too independent
to care for them. Pauline disliked him as much as her father
did, but her sisters tolerated him because he was sometimes useful
in waiting upon them to a concert, and in buying music for
them. As old Gil would never allow any gentleman to pay anything
for his daughters, Mr. Pilfor was always ready to execute
their commissions. If I had not disliked him on his own account,
I should for the sake of Pauline.</p>

<p>On our way down Broadway I refused all his invitations to go
into the various restaurants we passed and take some oysters, until
we reached the "Nunquam non paratus," an oyster cellar
under the Athen&aelig;um Hotel, when he took me by the arm and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now my deaw fellow, you shall not refuse me. Go in here
and take some game and some oysters. If you don't I shall be
offended."</p>

<p>Although I cared nothing about offending him, I allowed him
to lead me into the <i>Nunquam</i>, thinking it the readiest way to get
rid of him; there he introduced me to his friend Riquets, an odd
looking creature with a blotchy face, an embroidered coat, and a
fierce black moustache which tapered off to a sharp point like a
cobbler's awl.</p>

<p>"Come, Riquets, my deaw fellow, join us in some game and
oysters," and Mr. Pilfor.</p>

<p>Mr. Riquets had not the slightest objection to game, nor to
oysters; he was game himself, but he did not like to be made
game of, and thought anybody would find it a dangerous game
who tried to do anything of the sort. Mr. Pilfor smiled rather

<!-- Volume I, Page 263 -->

broadly at the immense wit of his friend, and we all sat down at
a round table, with a marble top.</p>

<p>"Grimshaw, my deaw fellow, call for what you want," said
Mr. Pilfor, reaching me the card. I declined calling, for I did
not want anything; the same offer as made to Mr. Riquets,
who also declined, saying that he was willing to trust to the
refined taste of his friend to order the genteel thing.</p>

<p>"Aw! very well, my deaw fellow," said Mr. Pilfor; "If
you don't know how to feed like a gentleman, I will instruct
you. Heaw, my good fellow; bring us three dozen of raw
oysters, in the shell, mind, with three fresh lemons, with an
incision in each, made with a silver knife&mdash;don't use steel, you
troglodyte&mdash;and have three dozens more broiled on a silver
gridiron&mdash;Shrewsburys, you monster!&mdash;and put on each oyster
one drop of oil, two grains of white pepper, and one of red; and
have three wood-cock ready by the time we have discussed the
bivalves. Now, vanish; and direct the principal of the establishment
to favor us with a call, if you please. In a moment the
keeper of the Nunquam made his appearance, in a white apron,
shuffling along in an uncertain manner, as though he had never
learned to walk, and stood in need of lessons in that necessary
art.</p>

<p>"Now, my deaw fellow," said Mr. Pilfor to the master of the
establishment, "have the goodness to bring us three bottles of
<i>clos voguel</i>, in a cooler, with plenty of ice."</p>

<p>The astonished proprietor confessed that he had never heard
of such a liquor, which brought out a smile of contempt from
Pilfor, who was astonished on his part at the ignorance of the
<i>canaille</i>.</p>

<p>"I must apologize to you for the absence of a respectable
wine," said Mr. Pilfor, "and hope you will be able to survive a
glass or two of Prince Metternich's Johannisburg. I suppose, my
deaw fellow, you have no objections to a glass of tolerable wine?"

<p>"I have, decidedly," said Mr. Riquets; "I object to anything
less than a bottle."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 264 -->

<p>Another smile from Mr. Pilfor, and a very significant glance
towards me from his eyes, as much as to say, did you notice the
brightness of that coruscation, from my friend, Riquets, my
deaw fellow?</p>

<p>It having been determined that we should survive a bottle or
two of Johannisburg, which proved to be so sour and cold, that
it almost took the teeth out of your mouth when you swallowed it,
the proprietor of the establishment was permitted by Mr. Pilfor
to retire; the raw oysters, the lemons, the broiled oysters and
the wood-cock, were devoured chiefly by Mr. Pilfor and his
friend, for my thoughts were still with Pauline, and I had no
appetite. Those two gentlemen also drank the three bottles of
Johannisburg, for the first glass that I drank satisfied my appetite
for that costly wine, which bore the gold seal of Prince Metternich,
who certainly showed good taste in not keeping such
dreadful stuff for his own use. Mr. Pilfor and his friend both
praised the wine and enjoyed the oysters and the game, and I
wondered at their marvelous powers in stowing away such
quantities of solids and fluids. Mr. Pilfor was bent upon
instructing me in the science of living like a gentleman, for he
next ordered some Charlotte Russe, then a couple of nutmeg
melons, a bottle of Noyau, and finally coffee; but coffee was
not the finale, for after that they called for a dozen <i>La Normas</i>.
Mr. Riquets lighted a cigar, and put three or four in his cap,
and remembering that he had an engagement, shook me cordially
by the hand, and after expressing a good deal of happiness in
having made my acquaintance, he twirled his little ebony stick
round his head, and suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>"That gentleman, sir, my friend Riquets," said Mr. Pilfor,
"is one of the most remarkable men of the age. He is a perfect
Admiral Crichton; he can do anything he has a mind to, sir."</p>

<p>"What has he a mind to do?" said I, for I had considerable
curiosity to know who he was, having come to the conclusion
that he was an Italian image vender, from the peculiarities of his
dress, and the manner in which his head was set upon his shoulders.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 265 -->

<p>"Everything," said Pilfor, who had no appearance of having
gone through such a marvelous feat of gulosity; "he <i>can</i> do
everything, but he prostitutes his splendid genius to the embellishment
of dreadful accidents in the DAILY DRIVEL. By the
bye!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Pilfor, "my deaw fellow, I suppose
you have some change about you, for I have just remembered
that I left my pocket-book lying upon my dressing-table,
and I haven't a shilling. If you will just pay the principal of
this establishment for the trifles we have had, I will settle with
you at my office to-morrow." Before I could recover from my
astonishment, he had told the keeper of the house that I would
settle for the little matters we had called for, and then disappeared.
If I could have avoided the payment I would, for I saw
that I had been purposely victimized; but I could not get clear,
and had to pay twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents for the
luxuries consumed by those genteel rascals. It was now near
midnight, I had made no calculation as to where I should sleep,
and was going to ask the proprietor of the Nunquam if he could
lodge me, when a little waspish-looking gentleman, who sat at a
table near where we had been supping, and had kept his eyes
upon us all the while, tapped me on the shoulder with his slender
walking stick, and motioned me to a vacant seat near him.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said I to the little gentleman, by way of giving
him an opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>"O, of course," said he, disdainfully, and rapping his nose
with the head of his stick; "good evening, of course. But I
should say it was anything but a good evening. But I don't
know anything&mdash;of course not; nothing at all&mdash;oh, no."</p>

<p>"Your language is very strange," said I, looking curiously at
the little gentleman, who smiled scornfully and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Why shouldn't it be? It is a strange
world, isn't it?&mdash;at least I think it is; but I don't know anything.
Resident professors are nobody."</p>

<p>All the time he kept eyeing me, and evidently aiming his remarks
at my head, but what he meant by them I could not conceive,

<!-- Volume I, Page 266 -->

for I had no recollection of ever seeing him before, and I
was very sure that he could know nothing about me. He had a
pale face, black hair, small restless eyes, and a remarkable moustache
with a disdainful curl upwards which seemed to bid defiance
to everybody. His dress was genteel and shabby, and he
wore an eye-glass suspended from his neck by a black ribbon as
school girls wear their medals. He didn't seem to be doing anything,
but sat at a little table with the stump of an unlighted cigar
in his mouth, and amused himself with his cane. As he
really seemed to regard me with a sinister expression, I asked
him if I had in any manner given him offence, at which he again
smiled sarcastically and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, no! Why should I be offended? I am nobody. A resident
professor has no right to be offended with anybody. Of
course not."</p>

<p>"Perhaps,"  said I, "the two gentlemen with whom I supped
just now may have offended you."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! Ha! ha! ha! A pair of fiends! Miscreants!
Of course you know who those black-hearted demons were!"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," said I.</p>

<p>"I do," said he, "and let me tell you, sir, to be on your
guard; they are musical critics, sir."</p>

<p>There was so much ferocity mingled with an obvious imbecility
in the manner of this little gentleman that I felt a curiosity to
know more about him; and although it was near midnight, I sat
down by him and asked him the cause of his animosity to those
gentlemen.</p>

<p>"What cause have I?" said he, again smiling in a terribly
sarcastic manner, "O, none; none in the world; none whatever.
Of course not; why should I?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said I, "I supposed that you had."</p>

<p>"Well, if you wish to know, then, you shall: they are doing
an immense injury to public taste. They are humbugs, sir, and
know nothing of classical music; nothing at all."</p>

<p>"And for that reason you hate them?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 267 -->

"Hate them!" exclaimed he, showing his teeth like an
enraged spaniel; "I would murder them and drink their blood!
They have no taste, sir, for classical music, and they are ruining
the country by their criticisms. But they hate you, too, as well
as myself and Madam Sprads."</p>

<p>"And, pray, who may Madam Sprads be?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"O, you don't know, of course! Well. I like to hear anybody
carry out the game when they once begin. Only, you
will allow me to remark, that I don't allow any person whatever
to insult my wife, sir." And then the little gentleman smiled in
a really frightful manner.</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed; I wouldn't, if I were you," I replied, not
having any idea of his meaning.</p>

<p>"And, of course, you don't know Professor Sprads?" said he,
with another vinegar-like smile.</p>

<p>"I never heard his name before," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" burst out the little gentleman, in a demoniac
laugh. "I like that." And then he whirled his stick round his
head, and hummed a tune. "But if you never heard of Professor
Sprads nor Madam Sprads, I never heard of the celebrated
English tenor James Charles Winderstool. Of course not.
O, no. But allow me to ask, sir, by what name I must address
you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Tom Pepper."</p>

<p>"Very appropriate, indeed. Well, that is very cool, and
quite delicious. However, I understand your motive. Come,
Mr. Pepper, do me the honor to go with me to my house and see
Madam Sprads; she will be delighted, perfectly delighted, to
meet you."</p>

<p>"It is too late," said I.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said he, taking my arm; "come; Madam
Sprads will be at her supper, and you will be just in time for an
oyster and a glass of sherry."</p>

<p>"And is Madame Sprads your wife?" I inquired.</p>

<p>The gentleman assured me rather equivocally that she wasn't

<!-- Volume I, Page 268 -->

the wife of anybody else. But I soon discovered that she really
was his wife, and that he was Professor Sprads, and nobody else.</p>

<p>I followed the Professor, or rather allowed him to take me
with him, to his house, in the upper part of the city, for it was a
matter of very little importance to me where I spent the remainder
of the night. Professor Sprads entrusted me with a good
many of his secrets and grievances on the way, and quite puzzled
me by his frequent allusions to that eminent individual, Henry
James Winderstool, whose name I had never heard before.
The Professor had a very singular habit of saying "O, no,"
when he meant to express a very intense affirmative, and say
"O, yes." So, when he told me, with great earnestness of manner,
that he wasn't appreciated by the public, and that Madam
Sprads had met with great opposition from those miscreants, the
musical critics, on account of her classical style and the purity
of her conduct, I did not know whether he was speaking ironically
or not. But it was very evident that the Professor really
felt that he was not properly appreciated, and the ingratitude of
the world, and its want of discrimination, as well as the generally
corrupt state of society, in regard to classical music, distressed
him as much as the miseries of the isolated household do a
Fourierite. These were enough for one man to bear, but in
addition to these distressing evils he had to bear up under the
favorable notions in the press of everybody but Madam Sprads,
who was better entitled to that sort of thing than anybody else,
on account of her delicious voice. The feelings which the Professor
entertained towards Mr. Riquets and Mr. Pilfor, the latter
gentleman in particular, were really frightful; and the punishments
he would inflict upon them if it were not for the consequences,
were most ingeniously savage and blood thirsty.</p>

<p>I could not convince the Professor that those gentlemen had
not poisoned my mind with tales about himself and Madam
Sprads; and as often as I had assured him that they had not
even mentioned his name to me, he would reply, with his bitter
smile:</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 269 -->

<p>"O, no. Of course not. I know they didn't. Why should
they? They don't hate me and Madam Sprads. They are not
jealous of resident professors. O, dear; no. Not at all. They
quite love me, too, I dare say, because I am not a humbug. O,
of course. The miscreants!"</p>

<p>And then the little man would go off in a bit of delicious classical
music, as he called it.</p>

<p>The Professor's residence was in Orange street, a quarter of
the city which I had never seen before, and notwithstanding that
he spoke in rapturous terms of his delightful apartments, it did
not give me a very pleasant impression when viewed by moonlight.
However, I had no right to find fault with the neighborhood
in which he chose to live, since he said it was perfectly
delicious, and Madam Sprads herself thought it charming.
What was it to me that the houses were old and crowded with
dubious looking tenants, that the streets were excessively filthy,
and that swine were lying about in the gutters, if Madam
Sprads was delighted, and the Professor, whose taste was so pure
and classical, thought it delicious, it would not have been
becoming in me to find fault, as I was only a chance visitor to
their residence. The Professor's house was a small two story
building, with a brick front, and rickety wooden steps; as he
rapped on the door, he said that the confounded servants were
probably all a-bed, and it was not impossible that Madam Sprads
herself would be compelled to open the door and let us in. This
supposition proved true, for presently the door was opened by a
lady in a night-cap, and wrapped up in a red blanket-shawl.</p>

<p>"What in the world has kept you out until this hour?" said
the lady, in a shrill voice.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" said the Professor, as he whispered in the
lady's ear. What he said I could not hear, but she reached
him the tallow candle which she held in hand, and immediately
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Walk into our drawing-room," said he, opening the door;
"Madam Sprads will be with us in a moment."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 270 -->

<p>The drawing-room was furnished with a pianoforte and a
harp, portraits of the Professor and his lady, sitting in a grape
arbor, and each holding a piece of music; mahogany chairs,
with blue velvet seats, a crimson sofa, and red moreen curtains.
I had but just time to cast my eye round the apartment, before
the lady entered who had opened the door, but in place of the
night-cap and the red shawl, she now wore a flaming head-dress,
full of blue roses, and a black mantilla thrown carelessly over her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Madam Sprads," said the Professor, "allow me to present
to you Mr. Tom Pepper. It is not Mr. Henry James Winderstool.
O, no. Of course not. Not by any means."</p>

<p>Madam Sprads was delighted to see me, as the Professor said
she would be, but why she should care anything about me was
quite a marvel to me. She was so monstrously large that the
Professor looked quite like a dwarf by her side.</p>

<p>"Have you had supper, my dear?" said he.</p>

<p>"Don't Alfred, be a simpleton," said Madam Sprads; "you
know we never eat suppers."</p>

<p>"O, no. Of course not. We don't eat a lobster salad every
night, nor boiled crabs, nor a cold chicken pie; nor drink a glass
or two of sherry. O, no. Madam Sprads is most deliciously
facetious to-night. Don't you think so, Mr. Pepper?"</p>

<p>Madam Sprads was by no means pleased at this sally, and
expressed her opinion that the Professor had been drinking at the
club.</p>

<p>"Of course. O, yes. I have drank a bottle of brown sherry,
two of pale, several glasses of brandy-and-water, and three cocktails.
I haven't been doing anything else. Nothing in the
world. I haven't been giving lessons to my class all the evening.
O, no. Of course not. I never do anything but drink all the
time at the club. O, no. But some supper we must have,
Madam Sprads. Anything will do. A cold chicken, a glass of
wine, some ice, and a biscuit."</p>

<p>"I declare, Alfred, if I don't expose you for going on in this
way," said his lady.</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 271 -->

<p>"Expose me!" exclaimed the Professor; "well, that is very
delicious; perfectly so. Do; I beg you will. It will be
delightful to Mr. Pepper. Of course he won't say anything
about it to Mr. Henry James Winderstool. O, no."</p>

<p>"If you will provoke me to it, then I will," said Madam
Sprads, turning very red in the face; "where is the money to
come from, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Money, Madam Sprads! Delicious! If you will expose
yourself, madam, allow me to ask where the half dollar has gone
that I gave you. Come!"</p>

<p>"If you are not a deceitful man, Alfred!" cried madam, "to
ask me for that half dollar, when you know it went for the trimming
of Euphemia's hat. Shame! shame!"</p>

<p>"Women are such delicious creatures!" said the Professor,
rolling his eyes up to the ceiling and clasping his hands together.
"There is no end to the money they throw away upon dress.
If you will lend me a five dollar bill, Mr. Pepper, I will return it
to you in the morning, or I will give you now five tickets to
Madam Sprads' benefit concert, whichever you please, and then
we will have a bit of supper&mdash;some delicious crabs, and a glass
of most excellent gin. We won't enjoy ourselves over it at all.
O, no. Not in the least. I should rather think not."</p>

<p>As I now felt really hungry, I gave the Professor the trifle he
asked for, and he handed it to madam, who said if the restaurant
was not closed, she would order the crabs immediately and the
gin, unless I preferred some other drink. But I preferred pure
Croton, so it was determined that Madam Sprads and the Professor
should regale themselves with gin and boiled crabs.</p>

<p>"You don't know Madam Sprads yet," said the Professor,
after his lady went out; "she's a most glorious creature. She
has such a pure style! So Classical! If it were not for those
incarnate fiends! miscreants! high-way robbers! villains! those
musical critics, we should have the most splendid connection.
But it's no use to be classical in this country; nobody appreciates
me. I am nothing but a resident professor! And there's

<!-- Volume I, Page 272 -->

Madam Sprads, a most delicious soprano, a perfect Catalani, and
nobody but myself appreciates her. They talk of Malibran and
Pasta. But what are they compared with Madam Sprads?
Nothing; absolutely, nothing. And here we are, without any
connection whatever, except the ten Misses Gilson, Madam
Sprads' pupils."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed with delight, "are the Gilsons your
wife's pupils?"</p>

<p>"O, no. Of course not. Madam Sprads hasn't taught the
whole family to play upon the pianoforte. To be sure she
hasn't."</p>

<p>"And does she know Pauline?" I asked.</p>

<p>"O, no. Of course not. Why should she? She hasn't been
giving her lessons for two years. She doesn't come here every
morning at twelve o'clock to practice on Madam Sprads' harp.
Of course not."</p>

<p>This was delightful news to me, and Madam Sprads really
seemed to me, when she returned with a tray, having on it a plate
of crabs and a bottle of gin, as magnificent and queen-like
a creature as the Professor had described her to me. It was a
delightful surprise to find myself in the very room in which
Pauline had sat, and I could have hugged the little Professor and
his wife for very joy. I was going to inquire more particularly
about Pauline, when the Professor discovered that Madam Sprads
had forgotten a salad, which threw him into a towering and most
tragic passion, and he went on declaring that crabs without a
salad were delicious, O, of course they were; and all that sort of
talk, until his lady got herself worked up into almost as great a
passion, and first burst into tears, and then caught up the tray,
and running to the door, threw its contents into the street.</p>

<p>The scene which followed this act on the part of Madam
Sprads, was of too delicate a nature to admit of my describing
it. The domestic bickerings of men and their wives, are too
particular and personal in their nature to allow of their being
spread before the public. Perhaps I have already transcended

<!-- Volume I, Page 273 -->

the strict line of propriety on revealing so much of the interior of
Professor Sprads' establishment, my design being the exposition
of my own character and adventures, and not to expose the
foibles and frailties of other people, a practice which is quite too
common among authors of the present day.</p>

<p>Madam Sprads very soon retired to her boudoir, and left the
Professor and me alone. I would have retired immediately and
left the Professor to his own gloomy thoughts, but he would not
allow me to do so until he had first explained to me the cause of
his inviting me to his house.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said the Professor&mdash;But the fact was of so remarkable
a character, and took so long in the telling, that I must
stop here to take breath, and narrate it in the following chapter.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

</div>

<p>"THE fact is," said Professor Sprads, "I didn't know who
you was, of course. O, no! To-be-sure not. And for that
reason, perhaps I didn't want you to hear Madam Sprads' delicious
voice."</p>

<p>The voice of Madam, which had ascended considerably above
C, in alt, during the duetto between herself and the Professor,
after the destruction of the supper, had sounded to me the very
reverse of delicious. It was, I had no doubt, classical, a great
point with the Professor, for it reminded me very forcibly of
what I had read about Xantippe, the wife of Socrates. Therefore,
I remarked to Mr. Sprads, that I was quite satisfied with
what I had heard of his wife's voice. The Professor smiled in
his bitter way at this, and said:</p>

<p>"O! of course. Why shouldn't you be? Madam Sprads is
nothing but a resident professor. She is nobody. She hasn't
been called the nightingale of the concert room;  of course she
hasn't. Perhaps a poet didn't say that a flock of mocking birds

<!-- Volume I, Page 274 -->

had built their nest in her larynx. O, no! Perhaps not. But
then, perhaps they did. What of it? Those fiends, those Malabar
pirates! those assassins!&mdash;but, I beg your pardon; I don't
wish to speak ill of your friends&mdash;I mean those very gentlemanly
and pleasant fellows, Messieurs Pilfor and Riquets, of course would not
allow any foreign professor to think well of Madam Sprads.
O, yes! But I invited you here that you might hear my wife's
voice, and be able to judge of her style for yourself."</p>

<p>"I think I have heard enough of it," I said, rising to go.</p>

<p>"O, of course! I am a most wretched creature. I am
exquisitely miserable. Nobody appreciates me; nobody knows
what a perfectly charming creature Madam Sprads is; and here
she has gone and thrown away an opportunity to form a most
splendid connection. O, it is delicious to think of! A plate of
the loveliest crabs thrown into the street; a pint of the most
superb gin wasted; two gentlemen of the press in triumph over
me; Madam Sprads enraged, and Mr. Henry James Winderstool
prejudiced against us. O! it's beautiful; perfectly ecstatic!
I am most exquisitely happy! Very."</p>

<p>The unhappy little object seized his hair with both hands, as
though he were going to tear it out by the roots&mdash;an act of
violence that would not have caused the Professor much pain,
for it was very observable that his glossy locks were fastened to
his head by artificial contrivances. He must have suddenly
remembered this fact, for he let go his hair, and turning upon
me with one of his exquisitely miserable smiles, said, in a
desponding tone:</p>

<p>"Of course you will not have Madam Sprads to sing at your
first concert? Of course not. Resident professors are of no
account. Why should they be?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Sprads," said I, "you talk very oddly.
What do you mean by resident professors, and by my concerts?"</p>

<p>"O, very well," said the Professor; "if the term displeases
you, I will say artistes. I should have said so at first."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that you must be laboring under some

<!-- Volume I, Page 275 -->

strange delusion," said I, "for your conversation has been quite
incomprehensible to me."</p>

<p>"O, of course. I dare say," said he, smiling bitterly again;
"I haven't been laboring under the delusion that Mr. Pepper is
the celebrated English tenor, Mr. Henry James Winderstool.
Of course not. Why should I? Perhaps that miscreant, Pilfor,
didn't let me into that secret. Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said I, "that Mr. Pilfor told you such a
thing?"</p>

<p>"Of course he told me such a thing, and that villain, Riquets,
swore to it, and said you had just arrived, and was going to give
a concert next week. Why shouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"Because there is no truth in it. I never heard before of the
person you call Mr. Henry James Winderstool. I am no tenor.
Those wicked rascals have been making game of you. My
name is simply Tom Pepper. Nothing more."</p>

<p>Upon hearing this the little wretch flew into such a terrible
passion, and swore so shockingly that he would drink the life's
blood of the two musical critics before he slept, that I began to
fear that he was in earnest. But the noise brought down Madam
Sprads, in her night-gown, at the sight of whom he demanded
his pistols, and was more violent than before. On hearing the
cause of this fresh outbreak, the queen-like creature begged that
I would retire and leave Alfred to her own management, which
I very willingly agreed to do. But before I went I got permission
to return the next day at the hour when Pauline called to
practice on the harp.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when I came out of the Professor's house;
the street was entirely deserted, the lamps burned dimly, and
from the gloomy and suspicious look of the neighborhood, I felt,
for the first time in my life, a little timid. I had not taken particular
notice of the turnings of the street when I walked home
with the Professor, and was not very clear as to the direction
which I must take to find my way back to that part of the city
with which I was acquainted. Here and there was a dim light

<!-- Volume I, Page 276 -->

in the upper chambers of some of the dismal old houses that I
passed, and every now and then I stumbled upon a slumbering
porker lying in the soft mud of the gutters. It was a filthy
street, given up almost entirely to vice and poverty, with here
and there a family like the Professor's, that were driven by high
rents to seek a dwelling place among characters who were so
well known as to be quite beyond suspicion. Alas! for the
poor, who cannot afford to live in a virtuous neighborhood! and,
alas! for vice that rewards its victims so badly that they cannot
afford to live among decent people! What a marvelous thing it
is that all men are not honest, since roguery so rarely prospers!
As I walked through this wretched place, and looking cautiously
around, saw how miserably its denizens fared, I congratulated
myself on the resolution I had taken to act honorably in all
things, and speak the truth without reservation, on all occasions.
I had walked but two or three blocks when I fancied that I heard
footsteps behind me, at a little distance; I stopped to listen, but
I could hear nothing, and supposed that it was the echo of my
own tread upon the pavement that had deceived me. I walked
a little farther on, and again thought that I heard distinctly the
step of a man behind me. I turned suddenly, but saw nothing
moving. It would have been an easy matter, however, for a man
to have been completely hidden in the dark shadows of the
wooden stoops, or to have crouched suddenly out of sight behind
the old boxes which lumbered-up the side-walks in front of the
grocers' shops, or to have slipped behind the clumsy awning-posts.
So I was not the less convinced that I was followed by
some one, from a sinister motive, because I could see nobody
near me. I began to think how I should defend myself, if I
were attacked, and as I had no weapon of any kind, I had made
up my mind to run, in case of danger, when I distinctly saw a
man's head projecting from behind a stoop but two doors from
where I stood. The sight startled me. But without betraying
any fear, I began to walk on, and immediately heard the same
step behind me that I had heard before. There was now no room

<!-- Volume I, Page 277 -->

to doubt that I was followed, and so stealthily, that it could be
for no other than an evil purpose. I quickened my pace, and
found that the person who followed me did the same. I was not
a little alarmed at this, but I began to have less fear when I
remembered that if the person who was following me had any
evil designs, he could not find a more suitable place for putting
them into immediate execution. The street was entirely deserted,
there was not a watchman within hearing, the inhabitants of the
neighborhood were probably too much accustomed to midnight
brawls to be easily disturbed, and the darkness of the night, and
the dimness of the street lamps, were all favorable to acts of
violence. But there seemed to be as much anxiety on the part
of the person, who was evidently dodging me, to escape from
observation, as there was on my part to escape from him. Being
convinced of this, and reflecting that I was acting in violation of
my principles, by making him think that he was not perceived,
I determined to stop and face him, and let the consequences take
care of themselves. I proceeded a few steps farther, and then
suddenly turned round and saw very plainly a man but a short
distance from me. He stopped immediately, but did not attempt
to hide himself.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said I, but no answer was returned.
"What do you follow me for?" I asked, but these was no reply.
My curiosity was now excited, and I determined to know who it
was that dogged my steps, and for what purpose I was followed.
I was not without a misgiving that there might be a design to
entrap me in some way, but I thought that it would never do for
a descendant of old Sir Eustace to show the white feather; so I
began to approach the stranger, who immediately turned upon
his heel and walked from me. This puzzled me more than ever,
and growing more bold as the danger of an attack grew less, I
called out to him to stop, whereupon he quickened his pace, and
began very rapidly to widen the distance between us. I saw
that he was a much stouter person than myself, and his step was
much heavier, so that if it came to running, I felt very confident

<!-- Volume I, Page 278 -->

that I could get the better of him. It was very evident that he
had some designs upon me, from his first following and then
shunning me, and I was resolved to know what they were. I
continued to follow him, until as he passed beneath a lamp which
gave more light than any other of the street lanterns, when I
thought that I discovered a resemblance to the man I had seen
in the Park, who so closely resembled Captain St. Hugh. I was
so confident of its being the same person, that I hurried eagerly
forward, determined to overtake him and find him out. So I
began to run, and when but a short distance from him, he suddenly
turned the corner of the street and disappeared. What
became of him I could not surmise, for there were no doors open,
and I searched every nook and corner in which he could have
secreted himself. The appearance of this stranger was a great
puzzle to me, but his sudden disappearance was supernatural,
and I began to think that I had seen the apparition of my father.
But I was not superstitious, and had no faith in ghosts; unaccountable
as the sudden disappearance of the stranger was, I was
convinced that he must be secreted somewhere in the neighborhood,
and I thereby resolved to remain near until he should
reappear. I had a curiosity to know who it could be that so
nearly resembled Captain St. Hugh. I walked back and forth
until I heard the clock of a neighboring church strike three,
without hearing a mouse stir, and feeling tired, but not sleepy, I
sat down upon the stoop of the corner house to rest.</p>

<p>It seemed to me but a moment since I sat down, when somebody
took hold of my shoulder, and jumping up, with my
thoughts full of the stranger, I saw that it was broad day. The
keeper of the shop on whose door-step I had fallen asleep, had
roused me, and laughed at my perplexity when I asked him if
he had seen anything of a strange gentleman about his premises.
The sun was up now, and the street, which looked so dismal by
night, looked disgusting by day. The swine that had been
sleeping in the gutters were now in motion, turning over the
heaps of filth in the middle of the street; wretched looking

<!-- Volume I, Page 279 -->

creatures, of both sexes, were hobbling to the grocers for their
morning dram; the stealthy dissipaters of the night before were
cautiously leaving the foul haunts where they had been overtaken
by sleep; the mechanics who lived in the neighborhood,
were going to their daily labors; the milkman and the baker
were travelling their rounds, supplying the daily wants of miserable
beings, who ate the bread of vicious idleness, and lived by
the wages of infamy. The place was sickening and disgusting,
and I was so much confused by suddenly waking upon such a
scene, that it was long before I could remember in what manner
I got there, or why it was that I was out of my bed at such an
hour; but when I recollected the appearance of the stranger, I
renewed my search for him, but without avail. Nobody in the
neighborhood had ever seen or heard of such a person as I has
described, and I was almost persuaded that I had been bewildered
by my dreams, or that it was the spirit of Captain St. Hugh,
come back to the earth to watch over me, or to reveal the cause
of his death. Finding, at last, that it would be useless to seek
any longer for an explanation of the cause of my perplexity, I
hurried to the store of Mr. Bassett to tell him of my night's
adventure, and to inform him of my intended marriage with
Pauline. He seemed a good deal surprised at what I told him
about the strange being who resembled Captain St. Hugh, and
smiled incredulously at my suggestion that it might be the ghost
of my father.</p>

<p>"Ghosts, Tom, have had their day," said Mr. Bassett, "or
rather, their night; for it was only in the darkness of the mind
that they ever made their appearance. When men die they
have done with the earth; so, rest assured, my boy, that if your
father should really have quitted the world, which, I trust, is not
the case, he will never come back again. You have been
deceived by your imagination, or else you have seen somebody
who bore an accidental resemblance to Captain St. Hugh. But
why should you be perplexed in either case? Do you not know
that your father would be too happy to encounter you, and if he

<!-- Volume I, Page 280 -->

were permitted to visit the earth, his spirit would not be backward
in revealing itself to you. So give up these wild fancies,
Tom, and think of the more serious matters of providing yourself
with some permanent means of subsistence. It is dangerous
to dream of ghosts and strange appearances; you live in a world
of hard facts, where everything is as solid as granite. Do not
indulge in schemes, and nurse wild hopes of growing suddenly
rich, but make up your mind at once that there is no fortune in
store for you but such as you can gain by your own industry and
integrity, and forget, if you can, that there is such a place as
Blackmere in the world. I am afraid that your thoughts are
running upon the estate of the St. Hughs, and you forget how
much more honorable it will be to you to make a fortune for
yourself than to inherit one from your ancestors.</p>

<p>I assured Mr. Bassett that he had altogether misunderstood
me, that I was not addicted to dreaming or scheming, and had
firmly resolved to depend upon my own exertions for my future
support, and to give him convincing proof of my earnestness,
I would accept of any employment he could help me to, that would
afford me sufficient pay to support myself and wife.</p>

<p>"Your what!" exclaimed Mr. Bassett.</p>

<p>"Myself and wife," said I "for I am going to be married this
evening."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my boy," said he, as he burst into a fit of
immoderate laughter; "marriage is no laughing matter, but I
cannot help laughing at you. What has put such a monstrous
thought into your head? You have fallen in with some sharpers
who have heard of your relation to the St. Hugh family, and
hope to make something by an alliance with you."</p>

<p>I soon undeceived him, and told him that it was the beautiful
and incomparable Pauline Gilson whom I designed to marry, and
feeling myself insulted by his laughing at me for thinking of
marriage, I was going to tell him that it was probably his own
experience of the marriage state that caused him to think so
lightly of it. But I checked myself, for I had too much regard

<!-- Volume I, Page 281 -->

for him to say an uncivil thing to him. He saw that I had
repressed something that I was going to say, and told me to make
a clean breast and keep nothing back. So I told him what I
thought, and he said that I must not judge too harshly of Mrs.
Bassett, as she had many excellent qualities, and was, on the
whole, a very good wife, and that he could easily pardon the
little irregularities of her disposition, as they all arose from her
too great fondness for him. He then requested me to tell him
what had caused us to think of getting married so suddenly, and
expressed his surprise that I should have fallen so deeply in love
without informing him of it.</p>

<p>"This is but a boyish freak," he said, when he had heard the
particulars of our betrothal; "wait a while, and you may get
over it. Besides, do you not see, Tom, how grossly you are
deceiving old Gil, by forming a design to marry his daughter
and not letting him hear of it? And what could have been more
base and insincere than the manner in which you stole into his
pew while he was engaged in the solemn duty of prayer, and
arranged a meeting with his daughter? This, Tom, was not
acting up to your resolution to be candid and honest in all
things."</p>

<p>I was forced to confess that I had behaved most basely, but
without being conscious of it. My love for Pauline had blinded
me to the true aspect of my conduct. But I would not allow
that we were under any obligations to inform her parents of our
intentions, and persisted in my determination to be married that
very night, and moreover told Mr. Bassett that I expected to
meet Pauline at the house of Professor Sprads, at noon.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, as though he acquiesced in
the reasonableness of my proposition, "you see how easy it is to
get married, from having gone half way through the ceremony.
But the difficulties all come afterwards.  The want of money is
not the worst thing that can happen to a newly married couple,
but you will likely find it so.  How much have you got
left of the sum that I gave you yesterday?"</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 282 -->

<p>I told him that I had it all excepting a small loan that I had
made to Mr. Pilfor, and five dollars that I gave to Professor
Sprads; and putting my hand in my pocket to examine the exact
condition of my treasury, to my surprise and mortification I discovered
that my pockets were empty. I had been robbed while
sleeping in the street, and was forced to confess that I had not a
penny left.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett now gave me a lecture on the importance of taking
good care of money, and told me that he could not much longer
continue to supply me, but that he would not see me want, provided
that I manifested a disposition to take care of myself, which
I promised to do, and told him that as I had never applied to
him I did not think that he had a right to lecture me on my
carelessness, although I felt myself under obligations to him, and
would repay him all that he had given me as soon as I was able.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Tom," said he, "that you will not very soon
have the ability, if you are so thoughtless as to get married without
first making provision for your wife."</p>

<p>"As for making provision for my wife," said I, "I confess
that I had thought nothing at all about it, for it seemed to me
that with so beautiful and so good a creature as Pauline, nothing
else could be needed to make me supremely happy."</p>

<p>"And she, I dare say," said Mr. Bassett, "was quite as silly
and thoughtless? Well, Tom, you have escaped a great peril;
think what the consequences would have been if your promise to
me had not prevented the consummation of so rash an act."</p>

<p>"The consequences" said I, "no doubt appear very terrible
to you, as they would have been, because you would not have
loved Pauline as I do, and she would not have loved you; but to
me, the consequences of marrying her appear to be perfect happiness."</p>

<p>"I hope, my poor boy," replied Mr. Bassett, "that you will
always feel as hopeful and as confident of happiness as you do
now. I believe that I had some such feelings myself once, and
thought of Mrs. Bassett as you do of Pauline."</p>

<!-- Volume I, Page 283 -->

<p>"Is it possible?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, smiling, "but it was a very long time ago.
However, I would not dampen the happy ardor of your young
feelings.  Pauline is as good as she is beautiful, I believe; I
hope she does not resemble her miserable old father, and if you
should ever marry her, you will be very happy.  But you are
too young to think of such a thing now.  Seek first for some
honorable employment, and when you have gained the means of
supporting her then it will be time to talk of marriage, but not
before.  I must leave you to your own discretion, however; but
take my advice, my boy, and be cautious about taking a step in
life which you can never retrace.  But you must now be in want
of your breakfast; take this bill, it is less than I gave you before,
and try to put it to better use than you did the last.  Lend no
money to the Pilfors and Sprads that you meet; the city is full
of such fellows, who live on the earnings of honest people, and
decoy such thoughtless boys as yourself into dissipation.  Remember
your promise to me, and do not commit yourself in any
manner without first informing me of your intentions.  You did
well to advise me of your marriage.  I have no authority to forbid
it, and you must be guided by your own judgement.  And do
not run about the street after people who happen to bear a
resemblance to your father.  If you should meet the stranger
again whom you followed so foolishly last night, pass him by,
unless he should speak to you first."</p>

<p>Feeling truly grateful to Mr. Bassett for his advice, as well
as for the money he had given me, I thanked him warmly, and
left him, to return to the house of Madam Sprads, where I was
determined to wait for Pauline, and, if she should be still willing,
consummate the ceremony of our marriage.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was my intention when I began to make a record of my
trippings, and their consequences, not to allow their publication
until after my death, lest some of those persons whom I had
been compelled to introduce into my biography should think
themselves ill used, and find fault with me for exposing their
foibles. But there had been so many erroneous stories told
about me, and my acquaintances generally entertained such very
wild ideas respecting my early history, that I thought it would
be the wisest way to tell my story plainly, and let it be known
while I was alive and could reap the advantages of being perfectly
understood by the rest of the world, for I come of a long-lived
race, the early death of my mother being the result of an accidental
cause, I enjoy excellent health, am blessed with a naturally
strong constitution, which has not been impaired by improper
habits, and bid fair to outlive all those, excepting my
children, for whom I have been at the pains to write my biography.
It could benefit me nothing to have my life published
when I should be dead myself, and all those for whom it was
written should have gone before me. An ordinary marble slab
will contain as much of my personal history as I am desirous

<!-- Volume II, page 4 -->

that posterity should possess. My only fear is that in the brief
record which the stone-cutter shall make of my life, some errors
will creep in, for brevity is no safeguard against mistakes, as the
literature of the country will show.</p>

<p>As to the objections of my friends to being put into a book, I
could not but think that such delicacy was rather an affectation
of modesty than a sincere feeling. Besides, what right had they
to complain if I treated them no worse than I did myself. To
do better by your neighbor than you do by yourself is clearly
transcending the Christian injunction. And then it is quite impossible
that I should add to, or diminish, the stature of my friends.
I am not accountable for their crookednesses. If I misrepresent
them, then my impersonations are not them, but mere names;
and if I represent them truly, what right have they to quarrel
with the mirror that gives a correct reflection of their features?
Thus I reasoned with myself; and determined to publish my biography
at once. But I did not reason correctly, as I have since
found, and it would have been better for my peace to have left
my auto-biography for posthumous publication. Even those with
whom I consulted, when I first thought of publishing, and who
advised me not to be too scrupulous about mentioning the names
of certain persons, were the first to complain when they found that I
had included their own in my memoirs. They were tickled with
the thought of seeing their friends showed up, but when they found
they had been shown up themselves all their philosophy left
there, and from being my best friends they have become my
worst enemies. This is very unreasonable. If I were writing
a work of fiction, instead of penning a sober narrative of truth, it
would be quite another matter, and they might find fault with
some reason; but even then, I might plead the practice of all
great authors, who have invariably introduced their acquaintances,
as well as themselves, into their works. The King of
Novelists, as Madame George Sand calls Walter Scott, says,
"no original character was ever composed by any author, without
the idea having been previously suggested by something

<!-- Volume II, page 5 -->

which he had observed in nature." This is an honest confession
from the most prolific of novel writers, who built up a great fortune
and a great reputation by using a capital which he found
ready invested in the characters of his acquaintances. Another
great master in the art of characterization, Sheridan, has slily
said, through one of his personages, "what is the use of having
friends unless one makes use of them." The portrait painter
puts his friends upon canvas; the historian sends them down to
posterity in ponderous volumes; the novelist and romancer transform
their friends into knaves and saints, for the amusement of
the world, while the daguerreotypist hangs up half the world in
little mahogany frames, and arranges them on the walls of a
room ten feet square for the inspection of curious visitors. There
is no good reason, that I can see, why the auto-biographist, who
writes an honest history of his life, or any part of it, should be
deprived of the privilege which all other men are permitted to
exercise. My friends must quarrel with their parents for making
them what they are, they have no right to quarrel with me for
describing them as they are. However, why should I attempt to
apologize for doing what has always been done, and always approved.
It is not improbable that King Richard the Third would
have quarreled with Shakespeare for drawing his portrait so correctly,
but all the rest of the world have confessed their obligations
to the dramatist for it; so, although one or two of my friends may
quarrel with me because I have enabled them to see themselves as
others see them, there are multitudes who have thanked me, and
begged that I would go on and finish the other volume of my auto-biography.
It is in obedience, therefore, to the demand of those
whom I have no right to disappoint, having, in fact, by the publication
of one volume, bound myself, by implication, to furnish a
companion to it, that I now resume my narrative, and promise to
continue it until I shall have given all that the reasonable curiosity
of the public has a right to demand.</p>

<p>It is extremely inconvenient to me to receive letters by every
mail, asking when I am going to finish my life, and to have people

<!-- Volume II, page 6 -->

stop me every day when I happen to go to my bookseller's,
for the last new work, or to my banker's, for my dividends, and
say, "Where's the rest of your memoirs?" "What has become
of that funny Ferocious?" "What ever happened to old Gil?"
"Is your present lady's name Pauline or Desire?" "Who
inherited the Blackmere estate?" "Do tell me if Mr. Pilfor and
Professor Sprads are living now?" "I wonder if I didn't see
your Riquets at the theatre last night, dressed in a blue cap and
fancy cravat?" To rid myself at once of these annoyances, by
gratifying the curiosity which I have excited, I have again
resumed my pen. The nights are getting longer and cooler, in
a short time fires will be agreeable, and already I can sit comfortably
at my desk and write by lamp-light without being disturbed
by mosquitoes. There is nothing, therefore, to interrupt me,
and I shall finish my task as speedily as possible, and trust that
when I get to the end of my second volume, none will repent
having followed me from the first.</p>

<p>I am not naturally churlish or unsocial. I probably take as
much unaffected pleasure in the society of my friends as any
other person in similar circumstances. But the circle of my
acquaintances is already very wide; in my varied fortunes I
have necessarily formed many intimacies, and I find it already
extremely difficult to entertain all whose company is a pleasure
to me, and who have claims upon my gratitude; I must therefore
hint to my numerous readers, that the fact of their becoming
acquainted with me from reading my memoirs, does not necessarily
impose an obligation upon me to become acquainted with
them. I trust that they will be able to feel an unreciprocated
sympathy in this case. I have been compelled to make these
seemingly ungracious remarks from having been called upon
during the past summer by a considerable number of persons
who addressed me in the most familiar terms, laughed knowingly
in my face, and when I told them, with some embarrassment,
that I had not the pleasure of remembering them, would reply
that they knew me like a book, as they had read my autobiography;

<!-- Volume II, page 7 -->

and I could not find it in my heart to give them to understand
that I had no ambition to cultivate such one-sided acquaintances.
My wife has been the greatest sufferer by these peculiar
friends, for they have eaten up all the fruits in my garden, and
she has none left for preserves. It is true, that from these
numerous visitors I have picked out two or three intelligent
friends, whose acquaintance I value highly, but I am willing to
rest content with the acquisitions which I have already made,
and hope to be excused hereafter from any more visitors of the
kind.</p>

<p>At the close of the first volume of my autobiography it will be
remembered that I had again called upon Mr. Bassett and had
my pockets refilled by that excellent gentleman, who had never
refused to supply my wants, nor met me with a frown upon his
countenance. But I could not help thinking that there was an
evident coolness in his manner towards me which made me feel
that he now befriended me from a sense of duty rather than from
affection, as he did at first; and I would have rejected his pecuniary
assistance had I not thought myself bound by his former
kindness to follow his instructions implicitly. He was a man
of such upright principles that duty was to him a matter of affection,
and he seemed, even in his mere business transactions, to be
influenced as much by a feeling of love towards those whom he
dealt with, as a desire for gain; and I have heard it said that
his customers all regarded him as a personal friend rather than
as a jobber with whom they dealt from motives of interest. His
treatment of me had been from the beginning kind and parental,
and I felt more deeply grateful to him from knowing how much
trouble it had cost him from the opposition of his wife, who without
having any decidedly bad qualities, was one of the most disagreeable
persons I have ever encountered. No one knew how
disagreeable she was so well as her husband; but he had taken
her "for better for worse," and he felt himself bound to make
the most of her. He knew that she was too old to alter, and
instead of making himself unhappy about her, he wisely made

<!-- Volume II, page 8 -->

up his mind to try and get used to her. By resolutely maintaining
his good nature, and allowing her to have her own way when
it did not interfere with his sense of duty, and accustoming himself
to looking at the few good points in her character, he contrived
to live with her and enjoy a tolerable degree of comfort in
his own house. It is not unlikely that my own feelings towards
her were somewhat embittered by her hatred of me, but I do not
think that I have given a prejudiced view of her character. Mr.
Bassett was in time very happily relieved from her, so that he afterwards
enjoyed many years of domestic felicity with a wife who was
in all respects the reverse of that troublesome woman; but as the
circumstances attending the exit of Mrs. Bassett from this stage
of existence were very peculiar, and intimately connected with
my own history, I must defer any further allusion to them until
the proper period shall arrive for their introduction.</p>

<p>The money which Mr. Bassett gave me, I found upon examination,
was a twenty dollar bill; and as he had impressed it upon
my mind that I must now seek out some means of employment
by which I would be enabled to live by my own exertions, I determined
to husband this small sum so carefully that it should
suffice for all my wants until I could hit upon some means of
getting a living by my labor. This appeared to me a very easy
matter; there were so many different ways of earning one's
bread that I felt no uneasiness as to my success. But my mind
happened to be too much occupied, just then, with the thought of
meeting Pauline at the house of Professor Sprads, and consummating
my happiness by our marriage, to entertain any other
project seriously. So, having eaten a slight breakfast at a public
restaurant in Broadway, and made my toilet at a barber's shop,
I went directly to the Professor's house, expecting to meet Pauline,
for it had never occurred to me that her running off from
her father the night before, at the prayer meeting, might prevent
her leaving the house the next day.</p>

<p>I had some difficulty in finding the Professor's residence
again, and some trouble, after I had found it, in gaining access

<!-- Volume II, page 9 -->

to the Professor and Madame Sprads, who happened to be at
their morning meal; and as the Professor afterwards confessed to
me, engaged in a little domestic scene cause by his remarks on
the coffee, similar to the one I had witnessed the night before on
the basis of an absent salad.  These little difficulties were not
uncommon in this musical family.  But on this occasion I saw
nothing to indicate a want of harmony between the Professor and
his lady; but, on the contrary they seemed to act wonderfully
well in concert, and their thoughts harmonized in the most extraordinary
manner.</p>

<p>The Professor kept me waiting a long while in his parlor to
amuse myself as I best could with the objects which it contained
before he made his appearance; and then he detained me a long
while in expatiating on the remarkable qualities of Madame
Sprads, before that <i>distingue</i> lady, as he called her, came in. I
was all the while waiting with great patience for Pauline, and
every time a cart rumbled past the house, Madame Sprads would
run to the window and say she was quite sure it must be the
Misses Gilson coming in their father's carriage.  To wile away
the time she volunteered to play some difficult pieces of the Professor's
composition, on her harp, which fairly set my teeth on
edge.</p>

<p>Then the Professor performed some difficult passages on the
piano, which had even a more unpleasant effect upon me than his
lady's performance on the harp.  There is really nothing so
difficult to endure, that I know of, in the way of enjoyment, as
difficult music; and that which the Professor and Madame
Sprads treated me to, was the worst I had ever listened to.  But the
thought that Pauline had sat in the same room, and produced
similar sounds, made it much more endurable than it otherwise
would have been.  When they had finished all their pieces,
and found that I was not much soothed in my feelings by their performances,
they began to entertain me by relating their grievances
with the press and the critics; and my hair stood on end almost,
at the recital of the wrongs that had been inflicted upon them by

<!-- Volume II, page 10 -->

Mr. Pilfor and Mr. Riquets, who had been employing their talents
and their pens in the base design of injuring the reputation of
every <i>artiste</i> who would not purchase their silence, and who had
an intense jealousy of Professor Sprads, on account of his elevated
character, and who persecuted Madam Sprads for two reasons:
Firstly, because she was pure and classical in her style; and,
secondly, because she was the lady of Professor Sprads.  I was
quite willing to believe that Mr. Pilfor and his friend could be
guilty of any enormity, after suffering as I had from their voracious
appetites and luxurious tastes; so I allowed the Professor and
Madam Sprads to indulge in the most liberal strain of remarks
upon the character of my two friends, without taking the least
offence; indeed, I am not quite sure that I did not myself speak
of them in terms not altogether complimentary.  I will not repeat
any of the many stories that the Professor and Madam
Sprads told me respecting those gentlemen, because I have understood
recently that they are both endeavoring to get up in the
world, and become honest members of society; Mr. Riquets
having been promoted to the situation of a check-taker in a circus,
and Mr. Pilfor being an assistant in a daguerrian gallery in
a neighboring city. It is true, that I shall be under the necessity
of detailing two or three little transactions of these worthies,
before I conclude my memoirs, but I shall not do them an unnecessary
injury by repeating the stories told about them by
other people; for I have once before remarked that it was for
the sole purpose of narrating my own adventures, and not those
of other people, that I undertook to write this history.</p>

<p>The time passed wearily enough at the Professor's house, in
spite of all the attempts which he and his accomplished lady
made to amuse me; for apart from the distaste which I had for
these people, who were dreadfully shallow, and never for a moment
succeeded in deceiving me as to their real character, I was
so impatient to see Pauline once more, that the wittiest or wisest
person in the world would have been tiresome to me.  Although
the Professor and Madam Sprads did not succeed in imposing

<!-- Volume II, page 11 -->

themselves upon me for the great <i>artistes</i> they represented themselves,
yet I must acknowledge that they succeeded in convincing
me that they were a pair of greater rogues than I at first
suspected them to be.  But it is quite impossible for any one to
be always guarded against a cheat.  The most shallow-witted
knave may succeed by misrepresentation in deceiving the most
worthy people.  I sat in the little dingy red-curtained parlor of
Madam Sprads&mdash;she chose to call it her <i>boudoir</i>, until I began to
think I had been deceived by the Professor, and that Pauline had
never been a pupil of his wife, a suspicion that was greatly
strengthened by the recollection that I had never heard the Gilsons
make any allusions to Madam Sprads, when a knock was
heard at the door, and the Professor starting up, exclaimed:&mdash;"Heaven
be praised!  These are those Gilsons, at last."</p>

<p>I was going to rush to the door, but Madam Sprads caught
me by the arm and begged that I would be seated, saying that it
might compromise the character of her establishment if I were
seen by the neighbors.  So I sat down again, and allowed Madam
Sprads herself to usher in the Gilsons, and I felt very much relieved
when the little Professor himself made his escape from
another door, saying that he could not allow himself to be caught
by the young ladies in his roquelaire.  Madam Sprads had been
gone but a few minutes when she returned and said: "Alfred,
my love, your purse, if you please; I want a trifle of twelve
shillings." But suddenly discovering that the Professor had
left the room, she exclaimed, "Mercy on me! I declare I have
unconsciously exposed myself.  Would you have the kindness
Mr. Pepper, to loan me so trifling a sum as twelve shillings, I
am sure I am quite ashamed to ask for it, until the Professor
comes in?"</p>

<p>I knew that if I loaned her the amount I should never get it
back, but I was desirous not to offend her until I was sure that
Pauline would not come; so I took out my pocket-book, reached
her the twenty-dollar bill that Mr. Bassett had given me, which
was all the money I had in the world, and told her to bring me

<!-- Volume II, page 12 -->

back the change.  Madam took the bill and disappeared, but she
was gone so unreasonably long that I began to mistrust that she
did not intend to return.  The Professor did not come back, the
Gilsons did not make their appearance, and I was now thoroughly
convinced that I had been grossly swindled.  I was just on
the point of searching the house for the Professor and his wife,
when Madam Sprads burst open the door, and rushing wildly
into the room threw herself upon the sofa and began to wring her
hands, and exclaim that she was ruined, and unless I would have
pity on her, her character was gone forever.</p>

<p>As my thoughts were mainly occupied with Pauline, I imagined
at once that the distress of Madam Sprads must be in some
way connected with that idol of my heart.</p>

<p>"Pray, tell me quick," I exclaimed, "what has happened?
Has any harm been done to Pauline?"</p>

<p>"O, no! no!" said Madam Sprads, falling upon her knees,
and lifting up her hands and eyes to me; "O, no! no! no!
Worse, much worse than that.  But say you will forgive
me; only say that!"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Madam Sprads," said I, rising and taking my
hat, "what you may have done requiring my forgiveness, of
course, but I forgive you; only give me my money that I may go,
for I perceive that there is no prospect of meeting Miss Gilson in
your house."</p>

<p>Hereupon Madam Sprads clung hold of my legs and nearly
tripped me up by her violent action.</p>

<p>"O, my dear, dear Mr. Pepper!" she exclaimed, "how can I
bring my mind to tell you that just as I was going to reach your
twenty-dollar bill to that baker's-man, a puff of wind came and
blew it entirely out of my hands, and I have not been able to find
it since."</p>

<p>I saw how it was; I had been robbed of my money, and there
was no help for it.  But in the anger of the moment I told the
lady that she was a cheat, and that I had suspected as much in
the beginning; and that I forgave her, but that I would have a

<!-- Volume II, page 13 -->

separate settlement with the Professor. This, unhappily, only
made matters worse, for she now clung to me with such force
that I could not get away, and she would not allow me to depart
until she had exacted a promise that I would not injure a hair of his
head, nor even tell him of the loss of the bill, for she said it
would ruin her dear Alfred's peace of mind forever, if he knew
how careless she had been.  This, too, I promised, for a moment's
reflection convinced me that it would be a waste of time
to attempt to get my money back from these sharpers.  Madame
Sprads said that I should not lose a penny in consequence of her
carelessness, for her benefit concert would come off in a few
days, and then she would have it in her power to repay me in
full.  But she said it would oblige her if I would consent to receive
twenty tickets, which I might very readily dispose of
among my <i>distingue</i> acquaintances.</p>

<p>I was heartily sick of such shocking knavery, and could not
but pity people who were reduced to the practice of such despicable
tricks for the means of subsistence.  "Ah!" thought I,
when I came out of the Professor's house, and found myself once
more alone in the world, without a shilling in my pocket, "why
will not people die when they find it impossible to live with
honor."</p>

<p>But I then had never known what it was really to feel the
want of money, and had not been compelled to resort to practices
which my necessities afterwards drove me to. A poor man
needs a greater stock of virtue in this world, to fortify him
against temptations, than a rich one does; and yet, from my observations,
I am bound to say that I believe there is more unequivocal
honesty of intention among the poor than among the
wealthy.</p>

<p>Whether the Professor and his wife had been deceiving me,
respecting the Gilsons, I knew not, but I had no doubt now, that
they were mere needy sharpers, and I resolved never to see them
again. If Pauline had ever been to their house, I did not believe
that I was likely to see her there again, and therefore determined

<!-- Volume II, page 14 -->

to seek and interview with her elsewhere. But being
now without a dollar in my pocket, and having no home, my
first thoughts were bent upon finding some employment, by
which I could earn my living, and get money enough to enable
me to pay off my indebtedness to old Gil.  It was idle to think
about marrying Pauline, until I could provide a home for her;
and as I could never think of anything but that bewitching girl,
when I was in her company, I concluded to avoid her, lest I
should be tempted to commit some imprudent act.  My first impulse
was to conceal my last loss from Mr. Bassett, but as I
should have to tell him in the end what had become of my money,
I resolved to get rid of that unpleasant duty at once, and
bear his censures as well as I could.  But, moneyless as I was,
I was determined not to accept anything from him again.  I felt
that it was now time that I took upon myself the responsibility
of my own support.  I could not but think that if ever I should
be restored to Captain St. Hugh, that he would think the better
of me for meeting my fate manfully, and refusing to live upon
the charity of my old benefactor.  With such feelings I once
more sought Mr. Bassett, and related to him my new misfortune.
He listened to me with greater gravity than he had heard my
other confessions, but did not show any displeasure.</p>

<p>"You have done right, Tom," said he, "to tell me of this last
accident.  If you had kept your loss to yourself it would have
subjected you to a good many mortifications, and the truth would
have leaked out at last.  But I am surprised that you should
have been so easily taken in after having been so recently imposed
upon.  I think you will be more careful hereafter.  But you
will never know the real blessing of having money in your pocket
until you have had to earn it by your own labor or ingenuity."</p>

<p>"Sir," I replied, a little touched by his insinuations, "whether
that will make any change in my conduct I cannot say; but I
trust I shall never be a miser in my feelings, or refuse to aid
those whom I have it in my power to assist, let me receive my
money as I may."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 15 -->

<p>"I should hope not, Tom," said Mr. Bassett; "but there is a
difference between giving your money and allowing yourself to
be robbed of it."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I replied, "I am determined to know what effect
it will have upon me to depend solely upon my own efforts for
support hereafter."</p>

<p>"That's a brave resolution, my boy," said Mr. Bassett; "you
will feel happier for it, I have no doubt.  But remember your
promise to me, and do not enter into any engagements without
first informing me of your intentions.  If you require a character,
send to me without any hesitation, and I will aid you all that
I can in that respect."</p>

<p>"You are very good," I said, "but I am afraid I that I must
depend upon what I can say of myself for a character.  I will
try to recommend myself by my fidelity."</p>

<p>"That's better and better," said he; "with such a determination
you have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>I discovered that he was not desirous that I should remain any
longer in his counting-room, so I shook his hand and wished
him good morning.  But he had not offered me any more money,
and I was doubly mortified. In the first place I had lost the opportunity
to refuse it, which I had calculated on, and had arranged a
speech in my mind for the occasion; and then, I was convinced
that he no longer felt for me the affectionate anxiety which he had
before so unequivocally manifested.  Let what would happen to
me, I was fully resolved to perish before I would accept any assistance
from him again.  I could hardly hope now ever to see my
father again, and but for Pauline, I should have felt quite indifferent
what became of me.  But I had no time for melancholy
speculations, my wants were immediate and pressing, and I had
the city before me to seek some means of supplying them.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>I HAD consumed nearly the whole afternoon, after parting from
Mr. Bassett, in searching for some kind of employment, but had
found nobody willing to employ me, probably because I was not
fit for anything in particular, and as I had eaten no dinner I felt
very hungry.  My appetite was probably the sharper from the
dubious prospect before me of being able to gratify it, and as I
passed by the old coffee-house near Sloat Lane in William street,
which was pulled down many years ago, and new stores erected
on its site, and burned down and rebuilt two or three times since,
the fumes of turtle soup rose from the grated windows of the
spacious kitchen of that celebrated house, and caused both my
eyes and mouth to run with water.  That was a fine lordly-looking
old house with an old-fashioned portico, arched windows and
noble fan lights that let the sun shine stream into its wide hall.
I wish they could have allowed that or some of the other spacious
old houses to remain; such a wilderness of square granite
columns as are now seen in that neighborhood present nothing to
awaken a reminiscence of old times; the place is as much changed
as though it had been overturned by an earthquake; and if it
had not been for the incident which I am about to relate having
occurred there, I should have lost all recollection of Sykes' old
coffee-house.  It was a famous place for good dinners, or at least
what was considered good dinners in those days, for it cannot be
denied that the last generation were shockingly gross eaters, and
that they understood very little about the pleasures of the table,
for after eating until their eyes almost started from their sockets,
they would drink until all sense of taste was blunted and all
perception of wit destroyed.  To drink until you fell under the
table, or grew so hilarious that you broke everything upon it,
was considered gentlemanly and humorous.  A man who should
do such things now would create no other feelings than those of
disgust or pity, but a shadow of the good time that's coming is
already upon us, and gluttony and drunkenness are going out of

<!-- Volume II, page 17 -->

fashion.  The art of enjoying life is better understood than it
used to be. Decanters and corsets are both out of date, and
many other similar things for which we are indebted to our ancestors
are passing away. Temperance, loose dresses and silver
forks, we owe to our selves. Our ancestors did all for us they
could, but they bequeathed us some shocking bad habits that we
have been at great pains to get rid of. One of the worst, was the
fashion of gormandizing and guzzling which was carried on to a
greater extent at Sykes' than at any other place in the city.
There was a large bar-room with a billiard-room attached, which
was a great place of resort for the dashing young merchants,
cotton brokers, and sporting characters of the day.  I had been
invited there on two or three different occasions to dine, and although
I disliked the place exceedingly, from the boisterousness of
the company, and the strong smell of cigars and whiskey punch
which pervaded it, yet when I scented the reeking fumes of the
hot turtle soup, I could not help wishing that I had the means in
my pocket to go in and pay for my dinner.  I resolutely walked past
the door and was just turning the corner, when I came full upon
Mr. Pilfor, who, as usual, was dressed very fine, with a white
vest and a damask rose in his button hole.  It was the first time
that I had met him since our supper at the Nunquam. I was
going to pass him by without speaking, but he reached out his
hand and said, "My dear fellow how are you? You are just
the individual in the whole world whom I had the greatest desire
in life to meet.  Do you know that I have been looking for you
every where? I have been wanting to pay you that trifle which
I became indebted to you through your extreme goodness at the
Nunquam.  Pray, how much is it?" I told him that I had forgotten
the exact sum, but that I would be content with twenty
dollars.</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars!" said he, "O, it's quite a trifle.  But
hang business before dinner. Let us go into Sykes' and eat a
spoonful of soup and then we will settle the matter."</p>

<p>I was really but too happy to accept the invitation of Mr. Pilfor,

<!-- Volume II, page 18 -->

because I wanted my money back, and because I was so
very hungry. We accordingly entered, when Mr. Pilfor called
for a private room and wrote upon a card at the bar directions
for our dinner. It happened very oddly that just as we were
going through the hall we encountered that Italian-image-vender-looking
gentleman of the press, Mr. Riquets, whom Pilfor insisted
should make the third of our party.  I will do Mr. Riquets
the credit to say that he blushed when he saw me, which showed
that his intimacy with Mr. Pilfor had not rendered him quite
so thoroughly proof against shame as that gentleman was. But
he directly recovered himself and began to make puns on my
name, calling me Spicy, and saying a great many smart things
which were excessively common place, and too palpable to excite
a laugh.  I told him that it was no use for him to pun upon
my name, because it would be altogether impossible for him to
say any thing which somebody had not said before him.  This
did not stop him, however, for he kept on all dinner time, and by
way of varying his humor and showing the extent of his wit, he
would address me very gravely and say, Mr. Mustard, I will
trouble you for the pepper, and when I told him he was extremely
silly, he said that he didn't ask me for any Pepper-<i>sauce</i>.
He laughed immoderately at these brilliant sallies and so did his
friend Mr. Pilfor. For my own part, I couldn't see the humor of
these merry gentlemen, and frankly told them so, at which they
laughed all the more.  The dinner having been ordered by Mr.
Pilfor was an extravagantly good one, as a matter of course;
there were four or five courses, an abundance of wine of the costliest
description and some hot-house fruits; Mr. Riquets having
discovered upon the bill some very curious old wines charged at
twenty dollars the bottle, took it into his head to taste it, and so
ordered a bottle.  I told him he was an extravagant rascal, and
that he had no right to put his friend Pilfor to such a needless
expense.</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you for the hint," said Mr. Pilfor; "upon
my word, Riquets, you are putting it upon me rather strong.  I

<!-- Volume II, page 19 -->

must examine my exchequer and see if I can stand such a drain
upon it."</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Pilfor began to feel in his pockets, first of his
vest pockets, then in his coat, his hat and his pantaloons. "How
very unfortunate it is," said he, affecting an alarmed look and
turning to his friend, "upon my honor, Riquets, I have been
robbed.  Some desperate wretch has certainly picked my
pockets."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed Riquets, rising, "let me go off to
the police office and give information, that the rogue may be
caught."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself, my dear fellow," said Pilfor, "let us
finish our cigars first, and then we will all go together; I dare
say our friend, here, Mr. Pepper, will loan me the trifling amount
necessary to pay for our dinner, until tomorrow, unless you happen
to have money enough about you for that purpose, Riquets?"</p>

<p>Mr. Riquets was excessively sorry, but he had just borrowed
a large sum and hadn't a dollar in his pocket.</p>

<p>"How very unfortunate!" said Mr. Pilfor, looking at me;
"if you and my friend Riquets will have the goodness to amuse
yourselves while I step to my office and replenish my purse, I
will be obliged to you."</p>

<p>"I have no objections to remaining here," said I, "but as I
am not the owner of a shilling at present, and don't know where
to obtain one, I would prefer not being left here unless the bill
is paid."</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary concatenation of circumstances!"
said Mr. Pilfor, turning quite pale, "since that is the case I
must go immediately to my office."</p>

<p>"Very good, gentleman," I replied; "of course you did not
call for this expensive dinner without the means to pay for it;
and as I was invited by you to partake of it, I am not going to
be left as a hostage with the landlord until you return.  So have
the goodness to keep your seats until I go and explain the matter
to him."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 20 -->

<p>"The fact is," said Mr. Pilfor, "I would prefer for you not
say any thing about the matter at present.  Leave all to me.
You and Riquets walk arm-and-arm together and say nothing to
anybody, and I will follow after you, and we can go with you to
your friend's where you can borrow a small sum until to-morrow,
when I will return it to you."</p>

<p>"No, I will consent to nothing of the kind," I said, planting
myself against the door to prevent either of the gentlemen from
going out; "I will ring for Sykes and tell him that I have eaten
his dinner, but have got nothing to pay for it."</p>

<p>It is probable that the wine I had drunk made me a little more
determined than I should otherwise have been, but I was not going
to allow those genteel rascals to feed themselves at my expense
again.  I would not have sat down to eat with them, but
hunger is a great destroyer of distinction, and I must confess
that I did not feel the same contempt for my table companions
before dinner as afterwards.  The two friends seeing my determination,
looked at each other in considerable alarm, and Mr.
Pilfor said, "Upon my life but this is really a most extraordinary
occurrence.  My dear fellow," to me, "I hope you don't intend
to involve us in a disgraceful brawl at a tavern?"</p>

<p>"I shall simply do as I promised," I replied, and caught hold
of the bell-rope and gave it a pull.  "Riquets, my dear fellow,"
said Mr. Pilfor, coming towards me, "we must floor this vulgar
rascal and get out of his company."</p>

<p>Both of them came upon me together but I soon gave Riquets a
blow that laid him sprawling, and would have sent his friend after
him, when the door was opened by a waiter, who Mr. Pilfor no
sooner saw than he caught hold of me and cried out help! help!
with all his might.  The noise brought more waiters, and Sykes
himself, who came rushing into the room, when that villain Pilfor,
who had caught hold of my collar, began to roar out that I
had robbed him of his pocket-book, and Mr. Riquets, who just
then picked himself up off the floor, swore to the fact, and added
of his own accord that I had attempted to put a couple of the

<!-- Volume II, page 21 -->

spoons in my pocket, and had knocked him down for trying to
prevent my escape.  These unlooked-for accusations enraged
me to such a degree, that I could not refrain from giving that
rascal another blow which sent him a second time sprawling upon
the floor.  Unhappy for me this exhibition of violence only
served to confirm in the mind of Mr. Sykes, the truth of what
Pilfor and Riquets had told about me, and he and his servants
caught hold of me and dragged me into the bar-room, where I
was exposed to the gaze of all the company assembled there.  As
for Pilfor and Riquets, they availed themselves of the confusion
to step out without saying any thing about the cost of the dinner
and when they were called to give their testimony against me,
could not be found.</p>

<p>"You are a precious rascal, sir," said Mr. Sykes, the landlord,
"to come into my house, without a dollar in your pocket,
order a dinner of eight or ten courses, drink up my costliest
wines and then walk off with my silver spoons in your pocket.  I
will have you in Bridewell for this.  I have had many such
a trick played upon me, and now I have caught one rogue he
shall suffer for the whole."</p>

<p>This is the justice of the world. But I did not feel inclined to
submit to the kind of treatment which Mr. Sykes was disposed
to award me; so I related to him the entire trouble, which he
seemed inclined to believe, the more so as neither Mr. Pilfor nor
Riquets could be found to substantiate their charge, and the bar-keeper
stated that it was Mr. Pilfor who had ordered the dinner.
Still Mr. Sykes was quite unwilling to liberate me, for he thought
it was quite time that somebody was made an example of to deter
other rogues from imposing upon him, and the effect would be
precisely the same whether I was guilty or innocent. I looked
around among the people in the bar-room to see I could meet a
familiar face, but they were all strangers to me, and I was beginning
to feat that I should either be compelled to send to
Mr. Bassett for assistance or spend the night in Bridewell,
when a gentleman who sat smoking a cigar close by with a

<!-- Volume II, page 22 -->

glass of brandy and water before him, spoke up and said, "It
appears to me, Sykes, that you are acting in a very unbecoming
manner towards the young fellow.  I have not the pleasure of
knowing him personally, but he has the manners of a gentleman,
and I remember perfectly well seeing him one night at the Nunquam
when he was swindled out of a costly supper by those rascals
in the manner which he has stated, and I have no doubt
that they attempted to gammon him again.  Let him go, Sykes,
and I will be responsible for his appearance to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Very well, very well," said Mr. Sykes "if you wish, Mr.
Wilton, I have nothing more to say about the matter.  The gentleman
is quite welcome to his dinner, if he cannot afford to pay
for it, but as for his companions, I will put a stop to their marauding
expeditions into other people's larders.  Confound their luxurious
appetites!"</p>

<p>"You are at liberty to go, sir, if you please," said the gentleman
who had volunteered to be security for me, and. whom Sykes
called Mr. Wilton.  "You understand, however, that I am
bound for your appearance here to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I am grateful for your kindness," I replied, "and will certainly
be here any hour you or Mr. Sykes may appoint, for unhappily
I have no business to prevent my coming.  But there will
be no good in coming back.  I have no money to bring with me."</p>

<p>"Have you not, indeed?" said Mr. Wilton, puffing out a cloud
of cigar smoke.  "That's bad.  I am sorry for you.  But you
have friends, of course, who can assist you?"</p>

<p>"If I have they do not know where I am, nor that I need their
assistance," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed!" said Mr. Wilson, as though my situation were
quite new to him.  "No money.  No friends.  No home?"</p>

<p>"No home," said I.</p>

<p>"That's very bad, indeed.  Very bad!" added Mr. Wilton,
soliloquizing, as he knocked the ashes from the end of his cigar.
"Have the goodness to sit down by me until I smoke my cigar.
Do you smoke? Ah, then you don't smoke!  That's very well.

<!-- Volume II, page 23 -->

But I like a good cigar, myself, there's a kind of comfort in it.
Old bachelors who are guiltless of the crime of matrimony must
have some sins.  But you drink?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Well, that's better still.  Drinking is a shocking bad habit.
But I rather enjoy it, than otherwise; and as long as Sykes keeps
such capital Otard, Dupuy &amp; Co., I can't think of giving up my
glass of brandy and water.  Of course you don't gamble?"</p>

<p>"I never have," I said.</p>

<p>"Better and better still," said Mr. Wilton, "but still there is
something very agreeable in the excitement of whist when
there's just enough staked on the game to make it worth while to
win.  You do well to shun cards and dice, they are ruinous to
young men; but as I have got no wife nor children, nor anything
of that sort, a game of cards is a very necessary kind of
excitement, and I am willing to acknowledge that I like gambling
in moderation."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilton having made these confessions to me in a very
ingenuous manner, remained for a few minutes entirely silent,
apparently quite absorbed in watching the smoke which he puffed
from his mouth, as it curled above his head.  He appeared to be
about forty years of age, he had a fine benevolent countenance,
handsome features, and his nose was just enough exaggerated
from the standard of nasal beauty to give an individuality to his
face; his eyes were black and keen, but he wore spectacles; he
had a lofty forehead, coal black hair which clung to his head in
crispy curls, a broad manly chest, and altogether the air and
manner of the kind of man who passes for a gentleman at first
sight without any question being asked.  His dress was peculiar,
but not odd.</p>

<p>He wore a blue frock coat with a standing collar, and a buff
vest buttoned close up in the throat, which gave him the look of
a soldier, although there was a freedom in his manner which is
rarely seen in one who has been taught how to carry his head and
hands by a drill sergeant.  He had a nobility of carriage which

<!-- Volume II, page 24 -->

was an inheritance. When he had smoked his cigar so that he
could hold it in his mouth no longer, and drained the last drop of
brandy out of his tumbler, he said, "Come, go to my room with
me.  I rather like you.  I think there must be something very
curious in your history."</p>

<p>I was but too happy to encounter a new friend, who seemed
disposed to render me a service, and I very gladly accepted his
invitation to accompany him to his apartment. "I must beg the
favor of leaning on you, my young friend," said he, as we
came out of Sykes' coffee-house. "I believe that I have got
the gout in my right foot, and since I have felt a twinge this
evening, I have been debating with myself whether the pain of
the gout is not greater than the pleasure of drinking a glass of
brandy-and-water.  What do you think of it? But as you don't
drink, and have never had the gout, of course you don't think
about it at all?"</p>

<p>"True," I replied.  "I have never had the gout; but as the
penalty of every sin must of necessity exceed its pleasure, there
can be no doubt that the pain of the gout exceeds the pleasure
of the brandy."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word," said he, "that's a view of the subject
I never happened to take.  You are right, of course.  If
the penalty did not exceed the pleasure of a transgression, why,
we might always sin with impunity.  But it's very clear that
there is no remission of sin.  Every transgression must exceed
its penalty.  Well, I will give up my brandy-and-water, and
perhaps the other things.  Faith, you have made me your debtor
already.  I must pay you for this.  But here we are at my
lodgings.  Let us walk in."</p>

<p>The lodgings of Mr. Wilton were in an old fashioned brick
house in Wall street. We struggled up stairs together, he leaning
rather heavily upon my shoulder, and delivering himself of
very gentlemanly and moral maxims all the while. There was
no light in the hall, or passage way, but when he opened the
door of his room, I perceived by the light that was emitted by a

<!-- Volume II, page 25 -->

small chamber lamp, that the house had been once a grand mansion,
but it was now cut up into offices for printers, lawyers, attorneys,
brokers, agents, editors, and all the tribe of nondescript
laborers whose implements of business consist of an ink stand, a
box of wafers, a few steel pens, a bundle of envelopes and a dusty
writing disk. Mr. Wilton's room was on the second floor,
and, from the appearance of the walls, had probably once been
the parlor of the house; the walls were covered with French
landscape paper, the cornices were heavy and constructed of
wood, the windows wide, with deep casements, and the fire-place
was ornamented with a richly carved Sienna marble mantel and
set round with Dutch tiles, illustrated with Scripture subjects.</p>

<p>The furniture of the room corresponded with its decorations;
from the ceiling hung a glass chandelier, with here and there a
broken pendant, the sofas and chairs were of old mahogany, and
almost as black as ebony, all of them having griffin's paws for
feet.  In one corner, there was a camp bedstead, and in the centre
of the room a new writing desk placed on an old table which
was filled with books and loose papers.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilton trimmed his lamp, lighted another cigar, stirred up
his Liverpool coal fire, and seated himself in his easy chair.</p>

<p>"And so, my young friend," said he, "you have got no
money, no friends, no home, and, by the way, no name, ha? I
have not heard your name yet."</p>

<p>"Tom Pepper," said I.</p>

<p>"Tom Pepper!" said he, "what a remarkable name.  Stop,
I must make a note of that.  Tom Pepper! Well, I never heard
a better name for a good slashing magazine story. Is it real, or
one that you have picked up?"</p>

<p>"I was born to it."</p>

<p>"Born to it.  Born to a name.  Well, I like that, too.  Why
that is in the regal style, I think, my young friend you will be
worth something to me, and I may be able to do something for
you.  Have you been to College?"</p>

<p>"No.  But I have had a little instruction in College learning."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 26 -->

<p>"Very good," said he, "and you know a little Latin and
French, and Mathematics, and Greek?"</p>

<p>"No Greek," said I.</p>

<p>"And you have seen something of the world, too, I dare say."</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"And a very little, too, I perceive, or you would not have been
taken in by those scamps Riquets and Pilfor.  I know them well,
the rascals; they took me in once."</p>

<p>"And you know so much of the world," said I.</p>

<p>"That's true.  But you see, my young friend, that an honest
man can never be on his guard against a rogue. Some people
adopt the villainous rule of believing every man a rogue until he
is proved otherwise; but I reverse the rule and trust that every
man is honest until he is proved to be a scamp. That's the more
gentlemanly and Christian way, I think. How do I know, now,
but that you are a rogue yourself!" And he eyed me very
sharply, but seeing no appearance of a blush upon my face, he
said, "pardon me my young friend, I know that you are what
you seem. In fact there are some faces that carry a letter of
recommendation with them, and yours is one of that kind. Give
me your hand.  Let us be friends.  And now tell me your
history."</p>

<p>I narrated to him in as brief a manner as I could the particulars
of my past life, not without a good many interruptions from
him, and ejaculations of, "You astonish me!" "You don't tell
me so!" "How very remarkable," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>At the close he said, "well my young friend you are just the
person I want; why with such experiences as you have had, I
would make a fortune by publishing my life in numbers. How
very strange that nothing of the kind ever happened to me.</p>

<p>"I cannot remember at this moment that I ever met with a romantic
adventure in my life.  And yet I have been about in the
world some too.  But somehow or other it has always happened
that everything has always gone on so smoothly with me that
my course of life has never had a ripple in it.  Something once

<!-- Volume II, page 27 -->

happened to a brother of mine, though, that was quite equal to
any of your adventures, but all the rest of my family have done
nothing but just live and die in the most ordinary manner, as I
suppose I shall do too; our family have all been in comfortable
circumstances. But I am fond of adventure, and every spring
I make excursions with my dog and gun up in Orange county,
but nothing ever comes of it."</p>

<p>"Pray what was it that befell your brother?" said I, feeling a
curiosity to know what accident my new friend counted as so
much superior to any that befell me, in point of romantic incident.</p>

<p>"My oldest brother," said Mr. Winton, renewing his cigar, and
resting his heels on top of the Sienna mantel-piece, "when he
left college took a fancy to make the tour of Europe, which was
considered quite an undertaking in those days.  Well, my father
fitted him out with a letter of credit on the Barings, and letters of
introduction all through Europe, from Liverpool to Constantinople.
He started off in one of the old packets for London, for
you know there were no steamships in those days, and we got
letters from him by every arrival, dated at Paris, Naples, Rome,
&amp;c.; after a while the letters ceased, and we wondered what
had become of him; but we had no fears of his being assassinated,
or of his having fallen into the crater of Mount Vesuvius,
nor anything of that sort, for, although he sent home no letters, he
sent a plenty of drafts upon my father, which the old fellow
grumbled terribly at having to pay.</p>

<p>"Well, my brother had been absent about two years, and my
father was talking seriously of sending me to bring him back,
when, to the astonishment of all, and my particular chagrin, we
received a letter from master Bob, his name was Robert, informing
us that he was on the point of being married to a lovely Countess,
with whom he would embark for home in the next packet
from Havre, in which he had already engaged his passage and
forwarded his trunks and so forth. Such a piece of news as this
put us all in the greatest ferment you can conceive of.  The idea
of Bob's marrying a Countess was amusing enough, and the terror

<!-- Volume II, page 28 -->

of my mother&mdash;rest her soul! she died yesterday a twelve-month&mdash;was
laughable in the extreme.</p>

<p>"What she was going to do with a Countess, how address her,
and in what room to put her, formed the topic of our tea-table
circle every night. My father, who was a cautious old fellow,
went about everywhere asking what fortunes Countesses usually
had, as a general rule, and whether they were related to the royal
family or not; my sisters were delighted, of course, with the
prospect of having a Countess for a companion, and as for myself,
I was merely vexed at losing an opportunity of seeing Europe.</p>

<p>"We got no more letters from Bob, but we heard of the ship's
leaving HAVRE in which he had taken passage, and began to
look for his arrival with great anxiety. The old house was
newly painted and papered and a room fitted up expressly to put
Bob and his Countess in. The whole family were dressed in
new suits, and we were all in great glee, when our merry house
was converted into a house of mourning by the intelligence that
the packet in which my brother and his bride had taken passage
was wrecked on Barnegat Beach, and every soul on board had
perished. You may imagine our grief, but it is hardly worth
while to attempt to give you any idea of it. Bob had always
been a rather wild boy but he was a brave, generous hearted
fellow, and in spite of his little excesses, I believe he was the
favorite of his family, if he was not the flower of the flock.</p>

<p>"After the first shock occasioned by this terrible news was over,
my mother begged that some of us would go down to Barnegat
and try to recover the body of my poor brother, as well as that
of the Countess, whose name would look very handsomely on the
family vault. My father would allow none of us to go without
him, so he and my two brothers started off on their melancholy
duty.  It was in the winter season, and there would be no difficulty
in preserving the bodies provided they could be found.
Well, when my father and brothers reached the beach, there lay
the ship, with a tremendous surf breaking over her, the trunks

<!-- Volume II, page 29 -->

of the passengers strewed about the shore rifled of their contents,
and the bodies that had been found frozen stiff and buried in the
sand without their clothes upon them.  It was a melancholy
task, of course, to disinter all those frozen corpses and find which
of them had belonged to poor Bob, whose better part, we fondly
believed to be in heaven.  But it was a pious duty, and notwithstanding
the freezing weather, they performed it without hesitation.
After disinterring a good many, they at last discovered a
body which they recognized as that of our unfortunate brother,
from the color of the hair and its size, although it was considerably
bruised.  There had only two females floated ashore,
and as one of then was black, and the other was the body of a young
and handsome person, with beautiful golden hair, and had altogether
a <i>distingue</i> appearance, they had no doubt of its being the
corpse of the unfortunate Countess, and of course they took it,
and having packed it in a box with brother Bob's, started off for
home. The grief of all the family was intense, you may be
sure, for although Bob was a great annoyance to us from his
extravagant habits, yet now that he was dead we mourned for
him the more for having spoken rather harshly of him during
his life time; and then there was something so tragic in the end
he made, with the golden-haired Countess whom he was bringing
home to us, who for aught we all knew, might have brought a
fortune into the family.  Well, they were both laid out in
separate coffins, side by side in our parlor, where the whole city
came to see them; there was no end to the poetry that was published
in the papers about them; and the golden hair, the frozen
strand, the storm, the wreck, the hapless bride, and all the horrors
of the scene in which they perished were worked up in
every conceivable form of verse.  A funeral sermon was preached
on the day of their burial, by our Dominie, who had married
our parents and christened Bob, and a most affecting discourse it
was, you may be sure; the Dominie rubbed up his reading and
quoted almost the whole of Falconer's Shipwreck in his sermon,
and there was not a dry eye in the church, as there

<!-- Volume II, page 30 -->

never is on such occasions.  The funeral was an immense
procession, for Bob had a good many friends, and all the sentimental
people in the city came to indulge in the tender thoughts
which such an event naturally engendered. Well, sir, the
funeral was over, the family had all gone into mourning, my
mother, pour soul! had begun to look up again, and my father
began to reckon up the time that must elapse before we should
know definitively, as he expressed it, whether or not we should
be any the better for Bob's marriage with a Countess, when,
one night about a fortnight after the funeral, as we all sat in
the parlor feeling very melancholy and trying to look cheerful,
we were startled by a loud knock at the door, for they had
knockers in those days; we all looked at each other in alarm,
but no one could tell why.  It was late in the evening, and it
had been a cold, dull day, and it is not unlikely our spirits
were affected by the weather.  But let the cause have been
what it might, we were all in a most drooping state, and there
was something peculiar in the knock that seemed to go to our
very hearts. I can't say that I have ever heard anything like it,
unless it be the thundering noise which the marble spectre makes
in Don Juan, when he comes to settle accounts with that rascal.</p>

<p>"It seemed to us that the servant would never get the front
door open, but at last we heard it turn on its old hinges, a gust
of wind rushed through the hall and seemed to shake the whole
house, and nearly extinguished the candles that were burning on
the parlor centre-table. As we listened breathless to catch the
next sound, and were fully prepared to hear something that would
curdle the blood in our veins, if it were possible for such a phenomenon
to happen, we heard as distinctly as we ever heard
anything in our lives, a voice say, "Where is my father?" It
was the voice of my poor brother Bob.  There was no mistaking
it, and I believe you might have knocked us all down with
a marabout feather. Not a soul of us stirred or spoke a syllable;
and the next moment the door opened, and who do you
think appeared before us?"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 31 -->

<p>"Why, your brother Bob, of course." said I.</p>

<p>"Why should you think so?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"Because, I saw from the first that he was not dead; you
began by telling me that your brother Bob had met with a singular
adventure, and there is nothing singular in a shipwreck
and death."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," said Mr. Wilton, "it was my brother
Bob, and looking as well an <i>distingue</i> as he ever did in his life.
He was so confounded good-looking, and rushed into my mother's
arms so hastily, and kissed her so heartily, that we saw at once
it was no ghost but Bob himself. However, his appearance was
so sudden, that it caused a terrible uproar among us, and such
hysterics as the women went into I could not give you the least
notion of. There it was, Bob dressed in the most <i>recherche</i>
style, and with a pair of the most frightful looking moustachios.
We were all so flustered, and Bob himself was so much astonished
at the kind of reception we gave him, that it was a long
while before he could understand what had happened to us; or
we, what had happened to him.  The whole thing was at last
cleared up, by Bob's telling us that he had been left by the
packet in Havre in which he meant to embark, and so had taken
passage in the next one."</p>

<p>"And the Countess, Bob?" said my father, "what became of
the Countess?"</p>

<p>"Don't mention her, father," said Bob, holding up both his
hands, "don't mention her to me again.  It was a regular
sell."</p>

<p>"And were you actually married?" said my father.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! no," said Bob, "I found out that my Countess
was a&mdash;&mdash;but never mind; I escaped two great perils at
the trifling cost of a thousand francs, and here I am, a wiser if
not a better man.  If ever I do marry, I assure you it shall not
be a Countess."</p>

<p>"Bob then sat down while one of us read to him all the odes
and poems that had been written on his death.  He said he had

<!-- Volume II, page 32 -->

not the least idea he was possessed of so many virtues as were
attributed to him, and my father told him that we had all been
equally astonished at the good qualities which had been discovered
in him.  And then my father told him he would have to
keep a sharp look out on his future conduct, lest he gave the lie
to his eulogists.  It was afterwards ascertained that the bodies
we had rendered funeral honors to were those of two steerage
passengers, poor Swiss emigrants, so we had them taken out of
our family vault and buried in Potter's Field.  As for Bob, he is
still alive and hearty, president of an insurance company and the
father of a dozen children."</p>

<p>"And this," said I, "is the only romantic adventure that ever
befell one of your family?"</p>

<p>"The only one," said he, "somehow or other, they didn't
seem to be natural with us; and yet I am very fond of that sort
of thing. I think I should like to lead exactly the kind of life
that Sinbad the Sailor did, or Gil Blas, or the young man in the
Golden Ass of Apulius, who, I have always thought, was more
to be envied than any other man that ever lived. Although it
would have been pleasant enough to lead such a life as Benvenuto
Cellini did, excepting that I should not have cared
about working in a goldsmith's shop; there was always something
revolting to my mind in mere mechanical labor."</p>

<p>"If you were so fond of adventures," said I, "it appears
to me a little strange that you should never have gone in
search of them, for nothing can be more easy than to put
yourself in a condition where you will be sure to encounter
more marvelous and exciting accidents than any that you
ever read of; for it is my opinion, from what I have read
and what I have experienced, that men who relate their adventures
always omit the most remarkable part of them, for
fear of not being believed."</p>

<p>"Indeed! you amaze me!" said Mr. Wilton, "pray now,
what should I do to meet with any of those surprising accidents
which you think so common?"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 33 -->

<p>"You have only to start off from here some morning," I
replied, "step on board the first steam packet, ship or stage
coach you meet, leave your trunk and your purse behind you,
change your name, and ask some respectable looking person to
lend you money enough to pay for your breakfast."</p>

<p>"There is some plausibility in what you say, I must acknowledge,"
said Mr. Wilton, "but suppose I should not be able to
borrow money enough for my breakfast, what then should I do
for my dinner?  Hang me if I would be willing to go without
my dinner for all the adventures in the world."</p>

<p>"I thought so," I replied, "people generally do that which is
most to their mind, when they are let alone, and as you prefer
the comfort of a good dinner and a quiet night's rest to the excitement
of the wild adventures which appear so delightful to you,
because they serve to beguile the time that would otherwise hang
heavily upon your hands, you remain quietly at home in your
snuggery here, and delude yourself with the thought that you
would fancy the life of a Knight Errant.  But you may be sure,
that those who are fond of adventures, and love the excitement
of a vagabondizing life, are just as fond of reading about quiet
fire-side scenes, and dreaming of the homely delights of a farmer's
life, as you are of reading of wild adventures and the perils
of the ocean and the forest.  Sailors at sea lie awake, in their
short watches below, and as they swing in their hammocks, beguile
each other with pleasant stories of country life, and make
vows that when they return to port they will make their way into
the interior of the country, far away from the smell of salt
water, and hire themselves out for shepherds or milk-men.  But
no sooner do they reach port than they long again for the excitements
and dangers of an ocean-life."</p>

<p>"There is something in that," said Mr. Wilton, "but my love
for the romantic is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We were now interrupted by the appearance of a smutty-faced
boy, having a paper cap on his head, who opened the door
without rapping, and said, "they want some more copy."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 34 -->

<p>"More copy," ejaculated Mr. Wilton, "why you little imp,
what have they done with that capital manslaughter I sent them?
But I forgot that I have been talking here these two hours, when
I should have written a letter from London to be received by the
packet that arrived this afternoon; and I have left all my memorandums
in my brother Bob's office.  Stop for a moment.  I will
write a leader on the probabilities of a general war in Europe;
and, my young friend, you take a pen and just write me off a
free, dashing and humorous account of the occurrence of the
dinner at Sykes', and of the conduct of your friends, Riquets
and Pilfor.  It will be a capital chance for you to do them up
very brown.  Just be so good as to head your article with something
that will catch the eye, as&mdash;A Scene at &mdash;&mdash;'s Hotel;
or, How to get a Supper Without Paying for it."</p>

<p>"May I ask, for what purpose you want it?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, I want it for my paper, of course.  You know that I
am editor of the Morning Luminary," said Mr. Wilton.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I did not," I replied, rather frightened at finding
myself on such familiar terms with the mysterious person who,
under the shadow of his imposing "WE,"  I had been used to
consider one of the greatest men of the day; "and I am afraid
that you estimate my abilities too highly, in believing me capable
of writing anything worthy of being printed in your paper."</p>

<p>"Fudge, fudge," said he, reaching me a pen, and placing
a quire of ruled paper before me.  "Write out the account for
me; it shall go in, and I may give you a place on the paper."</p>

<p>My ambition was excited by this promise, and taking the
pen I wrote a plain account of the dinner at Sykes', and
headed it thus: AN EXPERIMENT IN DINING; OR, EATING AND
NOT PAYING. By the time that Mr. Wilton had finished
his leader on the prospects of a general war in Europe,
I had finished my account of the dinner, and gave it to
him.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "is the thing.  There is a freshness, a vigor,

<!-- Volume II, page 35 -->

a simplicity, an earnest truthfulness in what you have written,
which I am exceedingly pleased with.  Here, boy, take this to
the office and tell them to put it up, and let them fill up with any
little horrific accident they can hit upon. I shall send them no
London letter to-night."</p>

<p>"It is not possible,"  I exclaimed, "that you actually manufacture
those foreign letters which I have often read with so much
satisfaction, and with such entire faith in their truth."</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he said, as he lighted another cigar, "and
I save by it a very handsome sum; the fact is, those London
writers require such extravagant pay that we can't afford to employ
them, and I, therefore, have to write my own foreign letters."</p>

<p>"I am amazed at it!"  I said, "How can you do it?"</p>

<p>"O! it is not such a very difficult matter," said he, "a very
little practice would enable you to write excellent letters from
any part of the world."</p>

<p>"No doubt," I said, perceiving that he misapprehended me;
"but how can you be guilty of such a piece of untruthfulness?"</p>

<p>"Untruthfulness! ha! ha! ha! Why, my young friend, a
little experience in the business of instructing the public will
soon give you correct notions on this subject. The object of
publishing a newspaper, sir, is to make money, and as in all other
trades, that course which is the most profitable is the most honorable."</p>

<p>"I thought it a very different thing." said I.</p>

<p>"Of course you did; people always form incorrect notions of
things seen at a distance," said my new monitor; "when you
walk on the Battery, for instance, of a bright afternoon, the Highlands
of Neversink loom up across the bay like a great lump of
lapis lazuli bathed in liquid gold, but when you approach them
you discover that they are nothing but a heap of red sand covered
with scrubby cedars.  But I believe that I am making use of
another man's idea, ' 'tis distance lends enchantment to the view,'
as Campbell says; when you come to know a little more about

<!-- Volume II, page 36 -->

newspapers you will have more correct notions on the subject.
I may say to you as the old statesman said to his son: go, my
child, and see with how little wisdom newspapers are conducted.
And may this be said of every profession.  Mind, I do not mean
to underrate the importance of my own calling, for it is one of
the most dignified and responsible that a man can engage in, and
to be tolerably successful, requires a much greater degree of
knowledge, tact, information, industry and honesty, aye, honesty,
than any other calling I know of.  A merchant or lawyer
may be secretly dishonest, but the newspaper editor cannot be,
whatever he does wrong is done in the eyes of the world; his
acts are all known, his thoughts are daily inspected by his readers,
and this necessity of openness begets in him a habit of honesty
which I think you will find no other class of men who labor
for their living can pretend to.  Whenever an editor is prosecuted
it is for speaking his mind too freely, but the sins of other
men are committed in secret."</p>

<p>I was charmed at this view of the editorial profession, and, in
the warmth of my admiration for such a noble occupation, which
led to such habits of candor, I exclaimed, "it is just the business
that I have been looking for; I will be an Editor.  I must have
some trade which does not encourage lying."</p>

<p>"You shall," said he, seizing my hands and pressing them;
"I am delighted with your ingenuousness and sincerity.  I have
long wanted to meet with a person of your character, and I am
delighted to have found you.  But, I am getting confounded
thirsty; this cigar that I have been smoking has such a shocking
flavor that I must take the taste out of my mouth.  We will
just have a drop of toddy.  I have got some capital Glenlivet
that was sent to me by that jolly good fellow, the Governor of
Coney Island."

<p>"Is there a Governor of Coney Island?" said I.</p>

<p>"Of course there is," said he, "and I only wish that every
island has as good a one.  The Governor of Coney Island is&mdash;but
stop, you shall judge of him by the taste of his whiskey."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 37 -->

<p>Mr. Wilton now drew a small iron-clamped oaken case from
beneath his writing table, and, having unlocked it, took out a
square-cut glass bottle with a gilt stopper, a couple of tumblers,
some lumps of sugar which were contained in a brown paper,
two silver tea-spoons, and a fresh lemon.  Having arranged
these articles on the table, and shut up one eye to enable him to
take an accurate view of the exact quantity of Glenlivet still
remaining in the bottle, the sight of which seemed to give
him such pleasure that he smacked his lips, while he contemplated
the gift of the jolly Governor.  He drew a sauce-pan,
filled with water, from a little nook behind the fire-place,
and having stirred up the fire and replenished it with some fresh
coals, set the sauce-pan on the grate to heat.  As soon as the
water boiled he mixed two tumblers full of punch, dividing the
lemon between them, and making the mixture so sweet that I was
quite unconscious of its strength until I began to feel it in my
head after drinking my portion of it. During all the time of his
preparing the punch he spoke not a word, being too much engrossed
in the important business which seemed to give him very
great delight. When it was all done, and he had tasted a drop
to assure himself that it was quite right, he sat down in his chair
with the air of a man conscious of having done something worthy
of note, and pushing one of the tumblers towards me, said,</p>

<p>"There! taste of that you dog! Is it good, ha?"</p>

<p>"Very," said I. "It is equal to my father's rum punch
which he used to make in the winter nights, when we lived together
at Bloomingdale."</p>

<p>"I presume it is better," said he. "I do not take much pride
in my leaders; but I think I may say without vanity that there
is not a man of my years in the world who can mix a better tumbler
of punch."</p>

<p>"Of course you do not mean that I should understand you to
say that the composition of a leader is not a more dignified and
honorable kind of labor than that of mixing a tumbler of
punch?" said I.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 38 -->

<p>"Of course not; but I was only thinking of how much
greater pleasure I take in making the punch than in writing
the leader."</p>

<p>"But in all our labors," said I, "we should think more of
the good we are doing to others than of the pleasure which we
derive from our work ourselves."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that your philosophy is sound," added he, at
the same time adding a few drops of the Glenlivet to his tumbler;
"I am beginning to think that no labor can be profitable to others
which is not profitable to the laborer himself. And by profit, I
do not mean pecuniary gain, but pleasure; for surely nothing
can be counted profitable which is not pleasant. The days of
asceticism are past, or, at least, they are passing away, and those
of enjoyment are coming.  I am rather doubtful, I must confess
to you, whether I am justified in continuing in a profession
which has so many more penalties than pleasures."</p>

<p>"And is the duty of an editor so severe?" said I.</p>

<p>"Severe, my young friend," said he, "that is not the proper
word.  Some stronger expression is needed.  No body labors,
in reality, but an editor; other men merely amuse themselves in
their occupations; the merchant has a merry time of it; the
lawyer trifles with his clients; the clergyman is but a grave
idler, who has only to study to keep his countenance free from
smiles; the mechanic and farmer, who literally live by the sweat
of their brow, and breathe the pure air of Heaven, are the happiest
of God's creatures; but the editor of a daily paper is a
poor slave to the public; he works when other people are asleep,
and never can know the luxury of taking an unconcerned view
of human affairs.  Let what will happen, in whatsoever part of
the world, it can never be a matter of indifference to him; he
must turn the matter over in his mind, and have his say about
it.  All is grist that comes to his mill, and whether a man be
married or murdered, the editor must be equally interested in the
event.</p>

<p>"He is happy to hear things every day that are perfectly

<!-- Volume II, page 39 -->

indifferent to him, and continually regrets to learn that events
have occurred which he forgets the moment he has given utterance
to such a thought, while he must be indignant at wrongs
which he never felt and recommend measures and men
of which he is profoundly ignorant."</p>

<p>"If that be the case, then," said I, "I think you have
abundant cause to be dissatisfied with your occupation; and I do not
see how you can reconcile it to your conscience to sacrifice so
much of your time and happiness as it calls for."</p>

<p>"Precisely, very true; I have long viewed the subject in that
light myself;" said he, "but we are happy to have it in our
power to announce&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To do what?" said I, looking up in his face.</p>

<p>"O, by the way," said he, starting suddenly, as though some
idea had just occurred to him; "what was it that you observed
just now, my young friend?" The next moment his head drooped,
his eyes closed heavily, the half smoked cigar fell from his
mouth into his shirt bosom, and he began to snore. The punch
had overcome him; and I soon felt myself sinking beneath the
same potent influence.</p>

<p>The room began to assume a strange appearance, the old furniture
with which it was filled grew dim and indistinct, and the
next moment I too was fast asleep.</p>

<p>It was day-light when I awoke, the fire had gone out, the
smoky lamp was flickering and threatening to go out too; the room
was in confusion and the air chilly; from the uncomfortable position
in which I had been sleeping my legs were cramped, and
I had a burning pain in my head.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilton sat in his easy chair, with his head resting upon
the table, snoring very loud, and apparently sound asleep.  His
wig had fallen off; and he made such a ridiculous figure that I
sat and laughed at his odd appearance, as I thought that the
helpless object before me was the brilliant, learned, profound and
sagacious editor whose daily observations on human affairs were
so eagerly sought after by the public, and who talked of Governors

<!-- Volume II, page 40 -->

and statesmen as though they were children standing at his
knee, and receiving lessons in life from a superior bring. Well
might he say to me, "go, my son, and see with what little character
a newspaper may be conducted." But he was at least
honest in his dishonest business. He pretended to nothing which
he was not.</p>

<p>The gray light of the morning began to assume a warm hue,
and hearing carts in the street, I knew that the city was awake;
I rose up quietly from my resting place, and stole softly out of the
room, leaving my new friend asleep in his chair, intending
to return to him again after I had refreshed myself by a
walk.</p>

<p>From the force of early habit, I still took pleasure in a morning
ramble; the freshness of the air, and the vigorous looks of
man and beast when they first rise from their night's rest and go
forth to their labor, have always had a peculiar charm for me,
and as soon as I left the apartment of the sleeping editor, I wandered
down to the markets, the centres of morning life and bustle
in a great city, where I remained longer than I intended to do,
and as I was returning to the room of my new friend, I was accosted
by a rough-looking man, who asked me my name.</p>

<p>"Tom Pepper," I replied, as usual. "O, ho!" said he, at
the same time seizing me by the collar; "you are the very person
I was looking for. Come, Mr. Pepper, you must go with
me."</p>

<p>"Not unless I know who you are, and where you want me to
go," I replied, endeavoring to free myself from him.</p>

<p>"You will find where I want you to go soon enough for your
own comfort," said he, dragging me after him.  But he found it
was not going to be so easy a matter to compel me to follow him
against my will.  As a crowd began to gather around us, he told
me that if I made any resistance he would call for help, and that
nobody would dare to refuse him assistance.</p>

<p>"Tell me who you are, and take your hand from my collar,
and I will go with you, but not otherwise," I said.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 41 -->

<p>"As for who I am," said he, "you are welcome to know that;
I am Jack Davis, the deputy constable of this city, and I am
going to take you to Bridewell, where you will be kept until you
can be tried for stealing a watch."</p>

<p>"Stealing a watch!" I exclaimed, in horror, "who accuses
me of such a crime?"</p>

<p>"Who?" said he, "why the gentleman you took it from, of
course. who else should?"</p>

<p>"Hallo! here's an item," exclaimed a voice that I recognized,
and turning my head I perceived that rogue, Riquets, with
a memorandum-book and a pencil in his hand. "What's the go,
Davis?" said he.</p>

<p>"It is nothing but a young fellow who has been making love
to a Mr. Wilton's watch," said the officer. "He has hardly had
time to pawn it since he walked off with it."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>AT the risk of being denounced as a radical and an innovator,
I must assert that the laws which permit an innocent man to be
locked up in a prison with rogues and poor debtors, are imperfect,
and require amendment.  At least, this was the opinion I
entertained when I found myself locked up within the stone walls
of the old Bridewell in the Park, without having committed any
offence against the laws of the State.  The officer who had arrested
me, told me that I had been guilty of stealing Mr. Wilton's
watch, and my angry attempts to convince him that I was innocent
of the charge only seemed to confirm him in his opinion of
my guilt.  Finding that resistance was entirely useless, I at last
suffered myself to be led into the prison, where, as soon as the
key was turned on me, I was surrounded by a set of rascals who
had just been let out of their separate cells into the long gallery
on each side of which they were ranged.  They crowded around
me with eager curiosity, and began to enquire what I had been

<!-- Volume II, page 42 -->

doing; some of them offering me their sympathy, and others
joking at my dejected appearance. It was sufficiently annoying
to find myself among such a set of confirmed villains, who
only laughed at me when I asserted my innocence of any crime;
but I soon had to endure a still greater cause of vexation, which
was only a prelude to other mortifications and misfortunes.  I had
not been long in the wretched place, when one of the turn-keys
called me to the barred entrance to the cells, and on going to the
door I beheld Mr. Pilfor accompanied by his friend, Riquets.
The latter person nodded familiarly to me, but his tall friend only
smiled at me, and then exchanged glances with his satellite.
Mr. Riquets drew his cloak over his shoulders, with a stage strut,
and throwing back his head, informed me in his peculiar jerking
manner that as he had formerly known me, he had no wish to
do me an injury in any manner, and that if I would pay him a
certain sum he would prevent the particulars of my arrest appearing
in the papers, and would see that my name was not mentioned
in any manner to compromise my character.  Of course
I rejected this base overture with suitable indignation, and told
him that I had no fears for the result of the strange accident
which had led to my arrest as a thief.</p>

<p>"O! very well," said Mr. Riquets, "you are the best judge of
the value of your own character; if you prefer seeing yourself
in to-morrow morning's papers as a thief, to paying a trifle to
prevent it, it is nothing to me; only as a friend to you, I felt
myself bound to do you a good turn.  So, good-bye to you. I
shall be present at your examination before the Recorder."</p>

<p>With this parting speech these precious rascals took themselves
off, and it was a relief to me to turn from such rogues at
large to the comparatively honest rascals who were my fellow-prisoners.
A young fellow among them, who had the appearance
of a well-educated youth, and whose dress and manner certainly
indicated a familiarity with genteel society, took me one
side, and said that I had made a great mistake by not bribing Mr.
Riquets, who was a reporter for many of the city papers, and had

<!-- Volume II, page 43 -->

it in his power to do me a vast deal of harm by giving a florid,
if not a wholly false statement, of the particulars of my arrest.
I replied to him that I was wholly innocent of the crime with
which I was charged, and that there would be no difficulty in
proving it; that to attempt to bribe a reporter to keep my name
out of the papers would only strengthen the suspicion of my
guilt, and that besides I had no money to bribe the rascal with,
even though I had been disposed to listen to his infamous proposition.</p>

<p>"But what has become of the watch?" said the young fellow.
"Of course you have not spent all the money you got for it; for I
suppose you put it in pawn as soon as you got away with it?"</p>

<p>It was no use to attempt to convince this hardened young thief,
for such he was, as I afterwards found, that I had not stolen a
watch, and weary and disgusted I sat down on the floor to avoid
the ribald conversation of the reckless rogues by whom I was
surrounded.  But it was some consolation to me, to know that I
was among men who had the candor to confess all their villainies,
and who were certainly no worse than they pretended to
be; for they took a pride in reciting their feats of roguery, and
those who had been guilty of the greatest enormities, were accounted
the best fellows.  The genteel looking young fellow
who had advised me to bribe Mr. Riquets, I was shocked to find
had been long guilty of robbing his employer, a merchant who
trusted in his integrity, and whom he had nearly ruined by his
robberies.  As I sat revolving in my mind what would be the best
course for me to pursue in my unfortunate position, I was called
to the door again where I found Mr. Wilton, who immediately
began to reproach me.</p>

<p>"I little thought," said he, "that I was warming into life such
a specious scoundrel as you have proved. But I now find that
you have not got your character of a romancer for nothing.  Return
me my watch, you scoundrel, and you shall have the full
value of it in money, and I will not appear against you if I can
avoid it.  If you had asked me for money, you should have had

<!-- Volume II, page 44 -->

it.  In fact, I had determined to make you a handsome present this
morning, for you had so deceived me by your specious manners
and plausible stories, that I must confess I was completely deceived
by you."</p>

<p>I was at first so agitated by rage, to hear myself addressed in
such a manner that I could hardly speak at all, but I at last told
him that if he had lost his watch, I was wholly innocent of knowing
what had become of it; that I intended to have returned to
him when I was arrested by the police officer, and begged that
he would see me out of prison, and not subject me to the mortification
and disgrace of being tried as a criminal.</p>

<p>"It is of no use, you villain;" said he, shaking his fist at me
through the bars of my prison door, "you need not deny it, for
there is no room for you to escape.  If there were even a doubt
of your guilt you should have the benefit of it.</p>

<p>"But what are the circumstances? I fall asleep in my chair,
with you sitting by my side; when I suddenly awake I see
something stirring in the room, and, opening my eyes discover
you are just opening the door to go out; I call, and you make
no answer, but hurry down stairs; the next moment I look
up to see what the hour is, and the watch which I had hung
up in the watch pocket above the mantel, is gone; thinking
that I had neglected to hang it up, although I am certain of
having done so, I feel for it in my vest pocket, and it is not
there.  Now, as the door had been locked on the inside, it
was quite impossible for it to have been taken by any one but
yourself; and coupling the circumstances with your stealthy
disappearance, your former bad character, and your confessed
penniless condition the night before,  makes it certain that you
stole the watch.  I am exceedingly sorry that a young man of
your really clever talents and interesting manners should have
been guilty of this act, but really, as a good citizen, I am bound
to see you properly punished.  But still the watch was of great
value to me, it was worn by my father many years, and contained
the miniature of my mother; I would almost as soon have

<!-- Volume II, page 45 -->

lost my life, and for the sake of getting it back again, I will promise
to do my best to have you set free, if you will confess what
you have done with it."</p>

<p>I could only repeat what I had already sworn; but I saw that
my denial had no effect upon him.</p>

<p>"My fine fellow," said he, "it will only be worse for you if
you continue to deny your guilt, for I can promise you that you
shall not escape the punishment you deserve, if there is any
power in the arm of the law, and if Justice has not put the scales
upon her eyes which she generally carries in her hands.  But,
let me reason with you; let me persuade you to act honorably
in this matter.  I can easily conceive that a youth like you, in
want of money, brought up in the loose manner in which you
have been, might have been tempted to take even an article of
greater value than a watch; I could forgive such an offence,
aye, even forget it, if you acknowledged your fault and made all
the restitution in your power.  But such obstinate villainy as
you show in retaining the watch, when you know that I
prized it infinitely above its intrinsic value, strikes me as one
of the most atrocious instances of thorough scoundrelism in
the whole annals of crime, I never heard any thing like it."</p>

<p>"I see," I said, "that circumstances are greatly against
me, and I may be found guilty of the crime by a jury, and
be condemned to punishment as a thief, and bear the reproach
of having robbed my benefactor, but, I cannot help it; I can
only swear to my innocence as before."</p>

<p>"Astonishing! astonishing hardihood!" he exclaimed. "Let
me remind you of another thing; what you will lose by this yourself;
not only personal liberty which must be very precious to one
who has led such a vagabondizing life as yourself; but consider
your loss of character, the loss of the esteem of your friends, of
the confidence of those who even think you honest; think of your
father, if he should be alive, think of the grief you will inflict
upon him by your obstinacy, and of all the mortifications that
may be spared to you by your confessing your crime.  The

<!-- Volume II, page 46 -->

affair has not yet been made public, it can be all hushed up;
you can be released from confinement, and I will pledge you my
word that you shall have some honorable employment, in which
you can retrieve your character, if you have honesty sufficient
to behave yourself properly."</p>

<p>"Do not afflict me any more," I exclaimed, "you have tortured
me enough already; it was not necessary for you to
remind me of my misfortunes; I see that I must suffer, and that
my past misconduct will be brought up to confirm my fault."</p>

<p>"Let me then," said he in, a softened tone, "make an appeal
to those generous feelings, which I perceive are not already
stifled in your youthful breast, it is a good sign to see you
moved, those tears are real, and they convince me that you are
not so bad as you seem.  What have I done to you that you
should injure me? I never wronged you, but on the contrary I
would have done you good; I had taken a sudden fancy for you,
and would have shared my last dollar with you; in fact, even
now as much as I regret the loss of my watch, I solemnly declare
to you that I am more moved at the sight of so promising a
youth as yourself in this degrading place, I would freely part
with my watch to set you free."</p>

<p>The other prisoners being attracted by the earnest expostulations
of Mr. Wilton, came crowding into the passage to listen to
him, and one of them called out in a gruff voice, "why don't you
give the gentleman his watch, or tell him what you have done
with it, you young scamp?"</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" said Mr. Wilton. "Why you will be
the scorn and contempt of your fellow-prisoners; they will
despise you for your meanness.  You will be hooted from the
company of all honest men, and even thieves will disdain to associate
with you."</p>

<p>"God knows," said I, "that I am innocent. And I can only
trust that I may be able to convince you of it.  You must think
of me as you will until I can establish my character, but what
to do I know not.  I know not where to look for help, but I am

<!-- Volume II, page 47 -->

bound to advise my old benefactor, Mr. Bassett, of all my turns
of fortune; so if you have really a desire to befriend me, let
me beseech you to inform that good man of my trouble and
where I am.  He will not think me guilty when I tell him that I
am innocent."</p>

<p>"Give yourself no trouble about Mr. Bassett," said Mr. Wilton;
"that excellent gentleman has already been informed of your
crime, and will soon be here to talk with you; and I hope that
he may produce more effect upon you than I have been able
to do."</p>

<p>Before he had fairly completed the last sentence, I looked up
and saw Mr. Bassett standing by his side.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, in his usually kind tone of
voice, although he looked very serious as he spoke, "what is
the meaning of your being in this place?"</p>

<p>"It is owing to one of those strange accidents," I replied, "of
which I have been the sport ever since I was born.  I know
nothing more than that I am accused of stealing this gentleman's
watch, and am here by force."</p>

<p>"And you are not guilty?" said he.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, for my feelings would not allow me to say
more.</p>

<p>"I believe you," said he; "you had no motive to rob; for
you knew that when you were in want you had only to apply
to me for aid, and that you would receive it."</p>

<p>"How, then, came he to be in want?" said Mr. Wilton; "he
was penniless when I found him."</p>

<p>" 'Tis but too true, and the fault was mine," said Mr. Bassett;
"I permitted him to go from me, when I knew that he
had no money in his pocket, because he did not solicit me for it.</p>

<p>"My poor boy," continued Mr. Bassett, "it is I who am the
guilty person in this case; if I had not allowed you to leave me
when I knew that you were in want of money, you would not be
here.  Forgive me, Tom.  Keep up your spirits and you shall
soon be released."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 48 -->

<p>"Never, sir," said Mr. Wilton; "he shall never come out of
prison until he restores my watch to me. You may believe him
innocent, but I know him to be guilty."</p>

<p>"We will see, sir," said Mr. Bassett, with more of passion
than I had ever before seen him exhibit; "we will see about
that, sir. Go back, my boy, to your cell, and give yourself no
further trouble.  You shall be released from this place, soon."</p>

<p>"Not if I am alive!" said Mr. Wilton; "I will not be robbed
of my property without having the satisfaction of seeing the thief
punished, if there is any such thing as law."</p>

<p>"I will stake my life on his innocence," said Mr. Bassett,
with increasing warmth, "and if there is any justice in law, he
shall not be kept in prison."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen left the prison together, and I felt very
little hope of being released, notwithstanding the confident tone
of Mr. Bassett's assertions, for I saw that the circumstantial evidence
against me was very strong, and Mr. Wilton's anger was
thoroughly roused.  I went back again to the further end of the
prison, that I might be free from observation, and out of hearing
of the other prisoners, who persisted in believing me guilty, and
encouraged me in their rude way to hold out and not confess my
crime.  I had not been there long, when I heard my name again
called, and going to the bars had the mortification to find there
Sophia Ruby and Wilson Goodwill.  It was a mortification to
me to see these persons, because I knew by their coming to see
me that the fact of my imprisonment had become notorious, and
I dreaded to think that Pauline should hear of my disgrace.  But
there was nothing in the manner with which these excellent people
greeted me, to make me feel that I was in a situation
which is ordinarily considered a degrading one. Mrs. Ruby
reached her hand through the bars and pressed my hand very
kindly, and smiled upon me more tenderly than she had ever
done before.  "You are very good to come and see me in my
disgrace," I said, "I am grateful for your kindness, which is not
wholly undeserved, for I will swear to you that I am not guilty

<!-- Volume II, page 49 -->

of any crime which should cause me to be sent to this place, and
am wholly innocent of that which I am accused of."</p>

<p>"Thee is perfectly right to say so; I would if I were in thy
place," said Wilson; "but we did not come to hear thy confessions;
Sophia and I just dropped in to say how does thee do, for
we heard thou was here, and it happened to be the first time we
have known where to call upon thee."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference to me," said Mrs. Ruby, "whether
you are guilty or not; I am not your judge; and I do not see
why it should make any great difference whether you or we
stand on the other side of this ugly barred door; we bear the
same spiritual relation to each other; there are many men who
deserve to be in prison, and I am sure that the accident of their
not being there does not increase my respect for them.  Whether
you be guilty or not is not my business; you are a human being
like myself; and I know that you have not injured me.  I
fear that there are not many objects of the beautiful in this place,
so I have brought you something to refresh your inner life."</p>

<p>From her allusion to internal refreshments, and seeing her put
her hand into her pocket, which apparently contained something
heavy, I concluded that she had brought me a flask of brandy or
some kind of cordial, which would have been a very acceptable
present at that moment, for I had not entirely recovered from the
effects of the whiskey punch which I had drank the night before.
But Mrs. Ruby's refreshments were always of a nature purely
spiritual, or, as she sometimes called it, &aelig;sthetic.  I was a good
deal disappointed when I saw her draw from her pocket a porcelain
sheep instead of the expected flask.</p>

<p>"This is a beautiful type of innocence," she said, holding up
the piece of crockery; "it was presented to me by a German
friend.  I think that the mouth has a remarkable expression
of innocence."</p>

<p>"It has certainly as sheepish a look as it would be possible to
give to porcelain, Sophia, I think myself," said Wilson.  "If
friend Pepper should take it into his cell with him he would not

<!-- Volume II, page 50 -->

be able to think of any thing but mutton while he remains
here."</p>

<p>"I think that the beautiful should be introduced into all our
places of confinement," said Mrs. Ruby; "the influence of
beautiful objects on the minds of the depraved cannot but have a
refining effect."</p>

<p>"As for that matter," said I, taking the toy in my hand, which
she reached through the grated door, "if objects of beauty had
the effect which you attribute to them, I do not see why there
should be any such thing as depravity in the world, for surely
the earth has always been full of the most beautiful objects,
and, so far as I can remember, mankind have always been the
most grovelling where the earth has been most liberally garnished
with beauties."</p>

<p>"Ah! but you confound merely natural objects with the
works of art," said Mrs. Ruby; "you do not mean to deny the
elevating effects of music and painting."</p>

<p>"I can only say," I replied, "that so far as my own observation
has gone, musicians and artists, are the least elevated class
of men that I have known; and if an art will not elevate those
who practice it professionally, I do not see how it can have such
an effect upon the mere amateur.  You would not pretend to say
that the inhabitants of Rome and Florence, who live in what is
called an atmosphere of art, surrounded by the finest examples of
sculpture, painting and architecture, and listening continually to
the choicest music in the world, are so elevated in their morals,
so pure in their philosophy, so rational in all their actions, as the
inhabitants of our country villages who live in mean wooden
houses, see no pictures but the head of Washington or Lafayette
on a sign-board, and hear no music but the dismal wailing of a
church choir?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that matter," said Mrs. Ruby, "I believe there
is an all-pervading sense of the sublime in our natures, which surrounds
us like circles and encloses us within its spiral influence,
until we are elevated by it to a higher stand-point than that which

<!-- Volume II, page 51 -->

is occupied by baser spirits.  There is always a yearning after
the infinite and the beautiful in all nature, and I was struck on
my way here at seeing a young chimney-sweep listening to the
tones of a hurdy-gurdy which was played by one of those dark-eyed
children of the south, who bring to us from their sunny
Italy, those little plaster images so redolent of art and beauty."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>"ALL that is unquestionably very prettily said," I replied; "but
it has always appeared to me that a love of nature is much more
ennobling than a love of art, and that those who do not love nature
first can have no real love for that which is at best but an
imitation of it.  This little porcelain lamb that you have so kindly
bestowed upon me, might, if I were shut up in a dungeon, be a
pleasant object to gaze upon, but a real sheep would be infinitely
more so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Wilson, "then thou would prefer a
dead sheep even to a live one, particularly if it were dressed,
for so the butchers call an animal, I believe, when they have
taken its skin off and left it in utter nakedness.  In short,
thou art fond of mutton chops, I perceive, friend Pepper."</p>

<p>"To say the truth, I am," I said, "and I must confess that
my mouth waters to hear you name them, for I have eaten
nothing for my breakfast yet, as the prison fare is not altogether
to my taste."</p>

<p>"I can have but little sympathy with tastes which are so
purely animal," said Mrs. Ruby; "I think that the soul should
rise to a plane that is elevated above mere animal appetite."</p>

<p>I had no disposition to offend Mrs. Ruby; indeed, I was so far
from feeling any, that I loved her for the simple-hearted kindness
she had manifested by coming to visit me in a place which
ladies generally avoid.  It was a loving nature that had prompted
her to bring me an offering in my confinement of what she looked
upon as an object of beauty; and an amiable desire to render

<!-- Volume II, page 52 -->

herself agreeable, had no doubt induced her to increase her personal
attractions by the application of a little rouge to her cheeks,
and some kind of liquid dye to her hair.  She was not an accomplished
artist, it is true, and from a lack of skill had failed to
conceal the art of her making up, so that the effect she aimed at was
not obtained.  But her motives were good, and she appeared to
me in a very amiable and agreeable light.  But I could not help
at last smiling at the extreme oddity of her opinions, and at the
contrast which she offered by her finery and simplicity, to the
subdued cunning of Wilson. There appeared to be some hidden
bond of union between these oddly matched persons which puzzled
me a good deal.  When Mrs. Ruby discovered that I was
laughing, she blushed very red, but said good naturedly, "I see
that you are ridiculing my strange notions, but I do not, of course,
expect that you should see truths with my eyes."</p>

<p>"It is true," I replied, "that I was laughing at what you
have been saying to me, for it sounds so oddly, and I can discover
so little in it that I can comprehend, and it sounds so
strangely to hear one talk palpable nonsense with so grave a countenance
that I could not help it."</p>

<p>"I admire your candor, Mr. Pepper," said Mrs. Ruby, "although
I see nothing to admire in your philosophy.  It is not
strange that one who can be so blind to spiritual enunciations,
should have been so indifferent to the simple rules of right and
wrong, as to take the property of another person and appropriate
it to his own use.  For my part I have great charity for criminals
of all kinds, and, indeed, I cannot say that I have ever felt
a strong regard for any, but the oppressed and degraded; but
still, I think that there should be a limit to our sympathy even for
those who are in your situation."</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, seriously, "you address me as though I
were guilty of the crime of which I am accused!"</p>

<p>"As I said before," she replied, drawing her shawl closely
around her, "it is a matter of indifference to me whether you be
or not.  You have not robbed me.  But they rarely put people

<!-- Volume II, page 53 -->

in prison for their good deeds; if you should be sentenced to a
long confinement, the Secretary of the Prison Society, of which
I am a member shall visit you."</p>

<p>"Thee is in good hands, friend Pepper," said Wilson; "but
if I were in thy place, I should do as thou does and deny my
guilt, because somebody may believe thee, particularly those
who do not know thee.  But thou has not forgotten of course, the
trifling mistake thou made one day, in walking off with my entire
suit of clothes.  Thee is welcome to them; but Sophia and
I have not forgotten the fact, and if thou shouldst remember it,
it would be advisable not to say anything about it on thy trial,
because it might prejudice the minds of the jury in regard to the
present charge against thee, which thou says is not true."</p>

<p>I gave the rogue of a quaker an indignant glance, and was
going to reply to him in a becoming manner, when a noise of
struggling was heard in the passage way, and I stopped to ascertain
the cause.  I heard the clinking of the keeper's keys, and
the voices of Mr. Bassett and Mr. Wilton, and I began to tremble
lest these two gentleman had got into a broil respecting my innocence.
Directly afterwards they came in sight, and rushed
simultaneously towards the grated door, both of them in a state
of great excitement and high perspiration.  "Open the door
quick," exclaimed Mr. Wilton, "open the door that I may myself
take him out of this shocking place.  Be quick, Mr. Keeper.
Why how you stumble along. Will you never open the door."</p>

<p>"Be patient, Tom; be quiet, my son, one moment longer,"
said Mr. Bassett, panting as be spoke.</p>

<p>"He shan't be patient a moment, not the shadow of a second,"
said Mr. Wilton, "why, I wonder if he will ever forgive me.
Come out! come out, you precious fellow, come out!" shouted
Mr. Wilton, in the most excited manner as the turnkey threw
open the door.  And thrusting aside Mrs. Ruby and Wilson, who
were quite confounded at this exhibition, I found myself suddenly
seized by Mr. Bassett and Mr. Wilton, who dragged me out
of the prison down into the front yard.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 54 -->

<p>"You are free, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, "you are free to go
where you please."</p>

<p>"He is not free," said Mr. Wilton, as he clasped his arms
around my neck, "he is my prisoner, I claim him as such, and I
will keep him the rest of my life, unless he runs away from
me like an ungrateful fellow.  But, I declare, I have a good
mind to go back into the prison myself, and remain there a
week, as a retribution for my stupidity."</p>

<p>Such was the suddenness of my liberation from prison, and so
excited were Mr. Wilton and Mr. Bassett, as they hurried me
down the stone steps and through the yard which enclosed the
Bridewell, that I had no time to ask any questions, nor could I
understand the meaning of the hurried remarks of my liberators.
A hackney coach was standing in front of the prison, and
into it they thrust me; they were about to follow me, when,
turning my head, I saw at a distance the same person whom I
had already encountered twice before, standing and gazing towards
me, with his arms folded, who bore so strong a resemblance
to Captain St. Hugh. I was determined now to speak to
him, and I attempted to jump out of the carriage, but Mr. Bassett
caught hold of my arm, and Mr. Wilton grasped me round
the neck so firmly, that, in spite of my exertions, I found it impossible
to escape, and I had the mortification of seeing the gentleman
turn and walk away, and in another moment he was out
of sight.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my fine fellow." said Mr. Wilton, "don't flatter
yourself that you are at liberty yet.  I have got charge of
you now."</p>

<p>But he said it so good-humoredly that I perceived he had no
intention of putting any restraint upon me. They both got into
the carriage, and Mr. Wilton ordered the hackman to drive to
Sykes'.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I, "that you have found the real thief."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," replied Mr. Wilton, "and the watch too, and
here it is.  And now who do you think the thief was? But you

<!-- Volume II, page 55 -->

couldn't guess, for he is in the carriage with you.  It was I. I
stole the watch myself.  Such a piece of stupidity is without any
parallel in the whole annals of crime; but, no: there was no crime
about it but the crime of accusing you of doing it.  Upon my
soul, Mr. Pepper, I don't think I can ever forgive myself, because I
don't deserve it.  If I were in your place I would certainly
shoot any man who put such an indignity upon me as I did upon
you.</p>

<p>"But you have not explained to him how the mistake occurred,"
said Mr. Bassett.</p>

<p>"Very true, very true," said Mr. Wilton; "you see, Mr. Pepper,
that yesterday I happened to break my watch chain, so I
dropped in at Demilt's when I was going to my brother Bob's
office, to get it mended, and left it there with my watch, meaning
to call for in the evening.  Now, it so happened that I had
no occasion to look at the time through the day, and having
dropped asleep by accident in my arm chair, after drinking that
confounded Glenlivet that Gil Davis sent me, I did not discover
that my watch was not in my pocket, for I always make it a
point to wind it up before going to sleep, and then hang it up in
the little embroidered case over the mantel-piece, which my
brother Bob's oldest daughter made for me when she was at
boarding school.  So, when I woke up this morning, I naturally
looked up to see what time it was, and not seeing my watch in
its place, I felt for it in my pocket, and not finding it there, what
could I think but that you had taken it?"</p>

<p>"What? Why I see no necessity for your thinking so,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to hear you say so," said he, "for I shall
feel very uncomfortable if you don't show some signs of resentment
for the manner in which I have used you. However,
there <i>was</i> a necessity for it, because the thought was purely
spontaneous, and once having taken possession of my mind, it
prevented me from recollecting what I had done with my watch.

<!-- Volume II, page 56 -->

In fact, I am really not so much to blame, after all, for according
to the psychological law of the human mind, it cannot entertain
two different thoughts at the same time; therefore, while I was
thinking that you had run off with my watch, I could not, of
course, be thinking that I had left it the day before at the watchmaker's.
Full of the thought that you had robbed me of my
precious time keeper, I went into Demilt's to inform him of my
misfortune.  'Well,' says I, 'Demilt, my watch is gone,' 'Gone!'
exclaimed Demilt, opening his eyes very wide. 'Yes,' said I, 'a
young thief; whom I took into my room last night out of charity,
ran off with it this morning.' 'Well, that is very remarkable,'
said he, 'I thought that this was your watch,' and so saying he
handed me my highly valued time piece."</p>

<p>"How did you feel, when you saw it?" inquired Mr. Bassett.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I was so tremendously mortified that I didn't feel
at all.  I was completely overwhelmed.  You might have knocked
me down with a feather as easily as with a sledge-hammer,"
said Mr. Wilton.  "Of course, I then remembered where I had
left my watch the night before.  I came out of Mr. Demilt's
wishing that the sun might be suddenly eclipsed so that nobody
should see me, for I thought that everybody would be looking at
me and laughing at my folly; fortunately I met with Mr. Bassett
who was just going in company with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another gentleman," said Mr. Bassett.</p>

<p>"Very good, yes; another gentleman," said Mr. Wilson, exchanging
glances with Mr. Bassett, "to bail you out of prison;
and when he heard that the watch had been found and everything
about it, we jumped into a hack and started off together to free
you from your unpleasant situation.  Now, my fine fellow, I am
desirous of making some reparation to you for the harm I have
done you.  I am most confoundedly sorry that I can do nothing
better for you than to offer you a situation on my paper."</p>

<p>"You could not do him a greater service," said Bassett, "and
I hope Tom, that you will have the prudence to accept of the
offer."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 57 -->

<p>"Most cheerfully," I replied, "I am only afraid that I shall
not be able to render myself useful to him."</p>

<p>"Never fear that," said Mr. Wilton, "I have seen enough of
you to be convinced that you have just the kind of talents that I
require.  But what is more desirable to me than all, you are
fresh in your manner of thinking, and vigorous in your style of
expression.  Besides, your candor is really something new and
entertaining.  The mere mechanical routine of the business you
will soon make yourself perfectly familiar with, while your originality
of thinking, and freedom from the common-places of the
press will make your services invaluable to me."</p>

<p>"Let it be understood," I replied, "that I do not accept of the
situation as an offset from you for the wrong done me.  If my
services do not prove profitable to you, I will not stay with you."</p>

<p>"Very well, very well.  I like that," said Mr. Wilton. "I
will engage you on those conditions; and as to the offset for the
wrong done you, why I would give you this watch if it had not
been a dying gift from my father.  But you shall have one quite
as good."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr. Bassett. "Tom will not accept one from
you; but he shall from me.  You shall have a watch Tom, and
I would add to it a portrait of old Sir Eustace St. Hugh if I
could. But perhaps it is better that you should forget him, and
be the founder of your own fortune."</p>

<p>"I have determined to found my own fortune if I can," I replied,
"but I do not know how I shall do it; as for old Sir Eustace
I fear I shall never see his estate, or be permitted to assume
his name, but until such a piece of good fortune befalls me, I
shall try to make the name of Tom Pepper more respectable than
it is now."</p>

<p>"That's a brave resolution, my fine fellow," said Mr. Wilton,
"and I will not hide the fact from you that there is rather a bad
odor about the name now, which this most unlucky imprisonment
will not have the effect to lessen.  But here we are back again
to Sykes'.  Let us go in and have some dinner.  Confound that

<!-- Volume II, page 58 -->

Glenlivet, I have felt it twitching in my gouty toe all the morning.
It is such subtle stuff that the moment I imbibe the least
drop of it, it runs like quicksilver to my extremities; one half of
it runs down to my toes and the other flies into my head; so that
it completely trips me up.  I must beg the favor of leaning on
your shoulder.  So, hereafter, I will let the Glenlivet alone and
stick to my old friends Otard, Dupuy &amp; Co.; brandy is the only
gentlemanly, respectable drink after all. Mr. Sykes," said he to
the keeper of the Hotel, as we entered the bar-room, which smelt
as strongly of cigar smoke as it had done the night before.
"Now, Sykes, my old boy, you must give us the best dinner that
your <i>cuisine</i> can produce, for three. But, by the way, Mr. Pepper,
just make out a catalogue of the dishes you would like, for
I suppose that by this time you feel like eating everything in
Sykes' larder."</p>

<p>I declined the privilege of choosing my dinner, for I was so
hungry that nothing eatable would have come amiss to me.</p>

<p>"Don't order your dinner for three," said Mr. Bassett, "my
good lady has exacted a promise from me to dine at home to-day."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mr. Wilton, "I would like to see any good
lady exacting a promise from me."</p>

<p>But Mr. Bassett was resolute, and he whispered in my ear not
to drink too much, and took his leave.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mr. Wilton; "I am determined upon ordering
a dinner for three, and perhaps I shall light upon some
clever fellow to share it with us before it is ready.  Now, Sykes,
let me look at your larder.  Upon my soul, it is a fine sight.
There is a noble saddle of bear's meat, venison, canvas backs,
woodcock, wild turkeys, pigeons, sea bass, and prize beef.  I
think we can pick a little something out of all these delicacies.
Let me see, Sykes, give us some Shrewsbury oysters and a lemon
to begin with, in the shell, of course; oxtail soup, if it is very
good; venison steaks on a chafing dish, and plenty of jelly; half
a dozen wood cock, and then canvas back ducks.  Pastry and

<!-- Volume II, page 59 -->

a dessert, and a bottle or two of champagne, and a decanter of
Otard, Dupuy &amp; Co.  Don't imagine that I dine in this manner
every day, my young friend; for the fact is, I am forced to be
rather abstemious on account of my sedentary habits; and, by
the way, as this is to be a particular occasion, one not likely ever
to recur again, I will indulge myself in just a drop of Glenlivet,
and after this I will forswear it altogether.  In fact, I believe
that a reasonable quantity of that kind of drink is very excellent,
as a corrective, after eating a hearty dinner."</p>

<p>So in addition to the already formidable order, a bottle of Glenlivet
was ordered, with hot water, sugar and lemons.</p>

<p>"And now," said he, "as it will be half an hour before
dinner will be ready, I will smoke one cigar, although I
am not in the habit of smoking, generally, before dinner.  The
practice is a very bad one, I know, and I am happy that you are not
addicted to it; but just one cigar, and a mild one, too, on a special
occasion like this, will not do much harm."</p>

<p>As Mr. Wilton lighted his cigar and sat down, I was rather
annoyed to see my old friend, Mr. Ferocious, enter the bar-room
accompanied by a gentleman who proved to be Mr. Tibbings.</p>

<p>"There are two remarkable persons," said Mr. Wilton, "I do
not think that I ever heard of a more singular attachment than
that which exists between those very individuals."</p>

<p>"Then you know Mr. Ferocious?" said I.</p>

<p>"Know him?" repeated Mr. Wilton, in a tone which implied
his astonishment at the supposition of his not knowing him.  "Of
course I do, and a most diverting character he is.  If he were not
with Tibbings, I would invite him to dine with me, but I cannot
have one without the other, or at least I cannot have Tibbings
without I invite Ferocious.  Look at them.  Now they are going
to drink a glass of port wine bitters together.  See with what
reverence Tibbings bows to his substance, for he is but the shadow
of Mr. Ferocious, and how like a conscious idol Ferocious
himself receives the adulation of his worshipper.  Ferocious,
sir, is one of those rare specimens of humanity who are only

<!-- Volume II, page 60 -->

endurable for their rarity, just as one monkey is an amusing
companion, but half a dozen of the simian tribe would be an intolerable
nuisance.  Yet Ferocious has a few good points in his
character."</p>

<p>"So has a monkey," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, there is something in that; but Ferocious is really a
fellow of some talent."</p>

<p>"And pray," said I, "did you ever know a man who had
not some talent?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to that matter, perhaps not; but what I mean about
Ferocious is that he has some of the talents he pretends to; his
friend Tibbings there gives him credit for all that he pretends to
and I believe a little more, which is altogether the most wonderful
instance of delusion that the whole annals of literature can
furnish.  Ferocious is the author of one book which nobody but
Tibbings has read, and on the strength of that one work,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The adventures of Christopher Cockroach, is it not?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right.  And you have heard of the book!
Well that is really wonderful.  But pray have you read the
Adventures of that wonderful person, Christopher Cockroach?"</p>

<p>I assured him that I never had, but that I had made the attempt.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is precisely my case," said Mr. Wilton; "as Mr.
Ferocious is my personal friend, and an American author, I have
actually imposed upon myself the reading of his book as an imperative
duty, but in spite of myself I cannot do it.  A poor devil
of a reporter once called upon me for assistance and said he was
willing to do anything for the sake of earning an honest living,
and to encourage him I agreed to employ him for a week; so I
thought I would try an experiment; I accordingly took the copy
of Christopher Cockroach, which the author had sent me in the
most obliging manner, and told the poor devil of a reporter to
read it through and make me a brief analysis of the story.
Well, sir, although the man was actually in a starving condition,

<!-- Volume II, page 61 -->

with a wife and small family dependent upon his exertions for
their support; after trying a whole day he came to me and said
he must resign his situation; he said he was willing to do any
thing in reason, but as for reading the book I had given him he
couldn't do it; he would sooner starve. Now, I think that the
man who can write a book which nobody can read, is a more
remarkable author than he who writes a book which is read by
everybody."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "you say that Mr. Tibbings has read his
friend's book!"</p>

<p>True, very true, I did I say so, and I have been told that he
has gone to the extent of reading it twice; but the fact is I do
not believe he has ever read it at all, for although Tibbings is a
very good fellow, and really a man of some energy of character,
yet I do not believe he is a Hercules, and nothing short, I am
sure, could ever accomplish such a task.  But, we are not likely
to have the pleasure of Mr. Ferocious' company at dinner.  He
and his shadow are going.  Well, I am sorry for it. It is really
amusing to me to hear Ferocious talk; he is so sublimely egotistical,
that, I must confess, I relish his company.  However, we
can do without him, a good dinner is of itself good company, as
my brother Bob says, and even a bear when he is roasted and
served up with a plenty of jelly is by no means an unpleasant
companion to sit down to; and those dumb creatures, oysters,
when they are broiled are really good fellows to be acquainted
with; and we may spend a pleasant evening with no other company
than a cigar and a bottle of wine.  We bachelors are
obliged to make social companions of everything and anything."</p>

<p>As my thoughts were never long absent from Pauline, and I
could not conceive of being happy without being in the society
of that darling creature, I could not help replying to Mr. Wilmot
that hungry as I was, and with a keen relish for the luxuries
he had named excepting only the cigars, which I abominated, I
would much prefer a dinner of bread and water if shared with
those I loved to the greatest delicacies in the world eaten alone.

<!-- Volume II, page 62 -->

<p>"Why the fact is, Mr. Pepper," said my new friend, "there
is a great diversity of opinions and feelings in respect to such
things.  Now, there's my brother, Bob, who was forever getting
married, as you see by his affair with the Countess; he must
be always head over heels in some domestic scrape, or other,
with his hands full of children, and parties for his wife's relations,
and all the multifarious engagements growing out of a large
domestic connection; but for myself there was never anything
half so pleasant as a nice quiet room with a good fire, a cigar, a
glass of wine, a new novel and sometimes a quiet friend.  By
the way, what a remarkable circumstance it is that when you
think of any one he is sure to appear to you; I was that moment
thinking of my quiet friend Woollish, and there he is, just in
time to join our dinner."</p>

<p>A rather stout gentleman with light curly hair, who wore a
blue-frock coat covered with braid and frogs, and a white Marseilles
vest buttoned close up to his chin, and with an umbrella in
his hand and a book under his arm just then entered the bar-room,
and walking up to Mr. Wilton shook him by the hand and made some
slight remark about the weather.</p>

<p>"Woollish," said Mr. Wilton. "allow me to make you acquainted
with my friend Mr. Pepper."</p>

<p>I rose to salute Mr. Woollish, who first deposited his umbrella
and book on a chair and then extended his right hand to me,
while with the left he raised his blue cloth cap.  After this ceremony
was over we took our seats again, and my new acquaintance
said to me, "I believe there is nothing new in literature?"</p>

<p>To this half interrogation I replied that I had heard of nothing,
but that I was not in the way of knowing much about the occurrences
in the literary world.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mr. Woollish, without seeming to heed my
reply, "that you prefer the quiet style of literary composition."</p>

<p>I replied that I could hardly pretend to have formed any tastes
in literature, and that I generally found something to interest me
in every author.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 63 -->

<p>"I think Cowper is one of the greatest of the English poets,"
said Mr. Woollish. "I like the quiet movement of his verse,
and his happy domestic subjects. Rabbits and tea-kettles, and
the heel of an old shoe, and a soft sofa are very pleasing themes
for a poet; such subjects have a soothing effect upon the mind."</p>

<p>"Why as to that matter," said Mr. Wilton, "I think, Woollish
that you are in error, so far, at least, as Cowper is concerned. I
think that in the whole annals of British poetry there is nothing
so violently exciting as the race of John Gilpin."</p>

<p>"I cannot say positively as to that particular poem," said Mr.
Woollish, "as I have never read it.  The subject is not suited to
my taste, it is altogether too violent; but there is nothing finer
in the whole range of English poetry than the lines on the feather
curtains of Lady Montague.  What is your opinion," continued
Mr. Woollish, turning to me, "of Gray's Elegy?"</p>

<p>"It is a very good Elegy, for a country church yard," I replied;
"but I think the world would hardly have felt the want
of it if it had not been written."</p>

<p>"What did you say is the name of your young friend?" said
Mr. Woollish turning to Mr. Wilton.</p>

<p>"Pepper;" said Mr. Wilton.  "Now don't attempt to make a
pun upon the young gentleman's name, Woollish."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall not," said Mr. Woollish, "but I was going
to remark that if he should mix a little attic salt with his pepper
it might assist him to appreciate the quiet poetry of England."</p>

<p>"Very good, that's most capital, Woollish; but, do you know
that my brother, Bob, said something very similar to it the other
night at a party?"</p>

<p>At this point I was greatly delighted by the appearance of
Sykes, who came in with a flushed face to say that dinner was
ready, and that the soup was done to a bubble, for I was dreadfully
weary of the conversation of Mr. Woollish who was as
quiet in his manner as he was in his literary tastes.  I had taken
him at first for a military gentleman from the peculiarity of his
dress, but I perceived that he was one of those persons who take

<!-- Volume II, page 64 -->

pride in appearing to be the reverse of what they are, and that
he wore a sort of military undress because his habits were altogether
unlike those of a military man.  As we walked from the
bar-room into the little dining parlor, Mr. Woollish took occasion
to ask me whether or not I had read his last work entitled, "A
few calm Thoughts on Literary Criticism." and on my saying
that I had not; he added, "you have heard of it, of course?"</p>

<p>But I was obliged to acknowledge that I had not even heard of
it.</p>

<p>"Then, I presume that you are not a literary man;" said Mr.
Woollish.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but he soon will be," said Mr. Wilton; "I have
engaged him for an assistant on my paper, Woollish, and you
will see traces of his pen to-morrow.  But come, be seated; the
soup is getting cold.  Now close the door, Sykes, and don't allow
us to be disturbed unless the house should take fire, and don't in
that case, unless the danger should be imminent.  You must excuse me,
Woollish, if I help our friend here first, because I have
reason to know that he has had no breakfast and his appetite
must be rather keen. What a delicious aroma arises from this
tureen?"</p>

<p>"Don't give me any, I beg of you; it is too gross; such food
is apt to excite strong passions in a man of my temperament.  I
will drink a glass of water while you are eating your soup,"
said Mr. Woollish.</p>

<p>"Don't drink water," said Mr. Wilton, "allow me, to take a
glass of brown sherry with you."</p>

<p>"I could not consent to it with consistency," replied Mr.
Woollish  "it is a kind of drink that has too sensible an effect
upon my system; I will drink part of a glass of hock, provided
they have any green glasses in the house, otherwise I shall be
compelled to decline pledging you in anything stronger than
water."</p>

<p>It happened that there were green glasses in the house, and also
some fine old hock, and Mr. Woollish deliberately drank our

<!-- Volume II, page 65 -->

healths out of a dismal looking green goblet and seemed to enjoy
it. The reason of his singular taste, I did not learn.</p>

<p>After the soup came a succession of rich dishes which I partook
of without much discrimination, and listened alternately to
the comments of Mr. Wilton on the cookery and wines, and to
the remarks of Mr. Woollish on the quiet style of poetry, which
seemed to be the only passion that he indulged in.  After the
dinner came cigars, which Mr. Woollish did not object to, because
they were gentlemanly and quiet; and he and Mr. Wilton got engaged
in an incomprehensible dispute about the merits of some poet
of whom I had never before heard, and I got into a very profound
and comfortable slumber which I enjoyed greatly.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when I was aroused by Mr. Wilton, who
shaking me by the shoulder said, "Come, my young friend, wake
up; it is time to go to the office and prepare a leader for to-morrow.
Rise Cynthia, rise!"</p>

<p>As I was enjoying the delights of an interview with Pauline
in my dream, and had been alternately visited by visions of that
young lady and Desire Goodwill since I fell asleep, I was not very
well pleased on being disturbed so roughly, and to be so suddenly
transported from a chamber of bliss to the dining room of
Sykes' Hotel, which was filled with tobacco smoke and looked
in the dim twilight as gloomy as the cavern of despair.  The
feeling was but momentary, however, for I directly came to my
senses and saw that I had got to engage in the hard reality of
working for my living, instead of whiling away my days in a
dream of love and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Come, my friend," said Mr. Wilton, "I must beg the favor
of leaning on your arm again; I have been listening to Woollish's
remarks so long that my legs really feel unsteady.  It is
rather late, too, and those confounded printers will be waiting for
copy.  We must hurry."</p>

<p>Whether it were owing to the remarks of Mr. Woollish, or to
the drop or two of Glenlivet, which Mr. Wilton had indulged in
for the last time, it is not necessary for me to say; but I found

<!-- Volume II, page 66 -->

that he leaned more heavily than usual on my arm, and was
more than ever troubled by his gouty toe. Mr. Woollish himself
had withdrawn in his quiet manner and left us alone, but he had
generously left his book behind him, with his autograph on the
fly leaf addressed to me, with a request that I would review it.</p>

<p>"Woollish is an excellent fellow, in his way," said Mr. Wilton,
as we walked towards his office, "an exceedingly gentlemanly
fellow, in fact; and the only literary man I have any intimacy
with.  Literary men are such queer kind of persons, that have
so many odd whims and require so much deference that I cannot
put up with their nonsense; but Woollish is a gentlemanly quiet
fellow, and an admirer of my political writings, I may say without
vanity, and I like him much.  Your literary men have no appreciation
of that sort of thing, and I don't know one of the whole brood
that has ever had the discrimination to discern the kind of merit
which my leaders possess besides Woollish.  I like to do him a favor
because he is a capital good fellow, a most capital good fellow!
and as he has addressed a few sonnets to me, I would like to
give him a good review of his book in my paper.  He has taken
a great liking to you and I think it would be a good subject for
your first attempt.  You shall review him in your fresh and
original style."</p>

<p>I was not very well pleased to have such a duty assigned me,
and pleaded my inability to do justice to Mr. Woollish's writings
from not having studied them sufficiently.  But Mr. Wilton
would listen to no excuse, and thinking that he might possibly
have a different opinion on the subject, when he awoke in the
morning, if he did not forget it altogether, I made no further objection,
and we arrived at his room in a few moments, where we
found a boy waiting for copy.</p>

<p>"Wait but a minute, my lad," said Mr. Wilton, as he seated
himself at his desk,  "and you shall have my leader;" and,
seizing his pen, he immediately began to write with astonishing
rapidity, on little slips of paper, which he threw towards the boy
as fast as he filled them.  I was amused to see him write with

<!-- Volume II, page 67 -->

such facility, and, when the boy had left, expressed my astonishment,
and asked him if he had been actually writing a leader
for his paper, and what the subject of his remarks was.</p>

<p>"The art of thinking is about as mechanical," said Mr.
Wilton, "as that of writing; and once you acquire the habit of
arranging your thoughts in a manner fit to be presented to the
public it matters not whether you communicate them by speech
or writing.  The art of communicating your thoughts or your
information to another, is one which may be easily learned, but
the faculty of thinking correctly is innate; now I think that
you possess the power of thought, and of course the art of communicating
what you think will be readily acquired; it will take
some time for you to learn the still greater art of hiding such
thoughts as may not be profitable to communicate to other people,
for the object of writing for the public is to please them, that
they may buy your paper, and not to instruct them, or benefit
them, contrary to their wishes."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, then," I replied, "that I shall not succeed as
well as your assistant, for I am determined not to conceal my
opinions.  I must be true to myself, for I am bound for the rest
of my life never to be guilty of dissimulation or deceit; and as
I have already found by my past experience that the habit of
secreting my thoughts leads to falsehood, let what harm come
from speaking plainly that may, it cannot be so injurious as that
which would result from dissimulation."</p>

<p>"O, of course not," said Mr. Wilton.  "I am quite charmed
with your sincerity. The idea of speaking what you think,
however, on all occasions, is so decidedly novel, that I am not sure
but that it would take in a newspaper.  In fact I am quite delighted
at the idea, and I have a good mind to try the experiment.
But, pray, Mr. Pepper, do you really intend to practice that
kind of sincerity at all times, and towards everybody?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I do," I replied; "is falsehood ever pardonable?"</p>

<p>"Well, upon my soul, that is taking rather exalted ground,
my young friend, and I cannot say but that you are right.  But

<!-- Volume II, page 68 -->

pray, would you express yourself with the same degree of
openness and unreserve to the public that you do to me; would
you call a knave a knave, in so many words, without any respect
to position in society?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I would," I replied.  "Why should I respect knavery
in one position more than in another?  Does God, does
the Law, make any distinction?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but how do you think that the thing would work? do
you think it would pay? do you think that the public mind is
prepared for such a radical change? Is it not in advance of the
age, and would we not subject ourselves to the charge of radicalism
or fanaticism."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said I, "but what then? do you think there
are not more honest men than rogues in the world, and are you
afraid of being too honest, too truthful, too magnanimous, too just,
too pure, too candid, too virtuous?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I ever have feared anything of the kind
yet," said Mr. Wilton, as he rubbed his glasses and put them on
again and looked me very earnestly in the face; "but to confess
the truth to you, my young friend, I have been guilty of the most
dreadful dissimulation and deceit; that is, if your theory of
truth be the correct one.  But how can it be helped?  The people
will not bear the truth; they would stop their subscriptions,
if I should venture upon such an experiment, and I should
starve."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not experienced in your business, but if that be
the case, then you are bound to abandon it.  I would not continue
in any employment which required so tremendous a sacrifice;
it would be better at once to go upon the highway, and
commence robbing passengers of their purses."</p>

<p>"O, no, no, no, my friend, there you are wrong," said Mr.
Wilton; "that would be a double crime&mdash;it would be breaking
the laws of both God and man; and it would subject you to disgrace
and imprisonment.  It is surely better to commit a legal
sin than an illegal one."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 69 -->

<p>I was forced to acknowledge that he was right.  "But I will
not believe in the necessity for falsehood," I continued; "all the
evil that has befallen me has had its origin in untruth, while no
harm has ever come to me from practicing the most transparent
sincerity in my conduct."</p>

<p>"There is so much plausibility in your theory that I have half
a mind to try it," said Mr. Wilton.  "I am almost inclined to
believe it will pay. It will be novel, at least; and novelty, you
know, is the life and soul of a newspaper.  I would like very
much to have my brother Bob's opinion about it, however, before
I begin, for he knows the world, and I have generally found his
judgment in such matters to be better than my own."</p>

<p>"He, of all men, in the world," said I, "should be in favor
of candor and honesty; after having been so deceived by that
French Countess."</p>

<p>"That is true, a very good argument, I must confess," said
Mr. Wilton, "if brother Bob should be of your mind and recommend
such a course, I would venture upon it at once.  But it
would make a great excitement in Wall street; and among the
Booksellers.  Good Heavens! what a regiment of old common
places would have to go immediately into a state of retiracy."</p>

<p>"Where they should go, of course," said I; "and their
places should be supplied by new thoughts, new expressions,
new feelings and new truths."</p>

<p>"There you are wrong, again," said Mr. Wilton, "you must
not delude yourself with the idea of propagating new truths in
a newspaper; it is not the proper vehicle for novelties of thought,
but for novelties of fact.  What I have just been writing now I
have had in my thoughts all day; part of it I found in an old
newspaper, and part of it I gathered from other sources; the
subject is not an important one, but what I have written upon it
will be new to my readers in arrangement, but old and familiar
enough to be easily recognized and understood; if it were new
or profound it would require time, study and thought to comprehend
it, and therefore it would not be read at all.  What I

<!-- Volume II, page 70 -->

mean by novelties, is a new mode of expression which your principles
if adopted in the conduct of a newspaper would call into
use.</p>

<p>"Thus, instead of saying, in regard to a new book, that it was
one of the most remarkable productions of the age, you would
simply say that from reading the title page, and feeling of the
covers, you had not been able to form any opinions of its merits;
or, instead of penning a few lines to announce the death of
some person, about whom you cared nothing, that it was with
the most profound feelings of regret that you announced the departure
from this scene of action of so-and-so, you would merely
put the man's death in your obituary, and say that you cared
nothing about it, if you said anything at all. All such expressions
as 'it is with the greatest pleasure that we hear so-and-so,'
or 'we are extremely mortified at this occurrence,' or 'we
are deeply grieved at that,' which are generally written with
the same pen, and with the same feeling of perfect indifference,
would all have to be laid aside; and as nothing but the simple
truth would ever be stated, each paper, instead of being a mere
modification of another, would be entirely original, a thing by
itself; and not an unsubstantial shadow of something else. Then
what would become of all the patriotism, all the chivalry, all
the eloquence, all the thrilling excitement, all the dreadful accidents,
all the brilliant audiences, all the incomparable singers,
all the overflowing houses, all the most remarkable men
of the age, the gentlemanly addresses, the ravishing music which put
an audience to sleep, the thrilling romance which nobody can
read, the ardent patriots who sell themselves for an office,
the upright lawyers, who take fees from rogues.  How do you
think, Mr. Pepper, a newspaper would look without any of
these things?"</p>

<p>"Remarkably well," said I, "if they could not be honestly
put into it.  The truth is, now, that hyperbole has exhausted itself;
the most extravagant praises sound tame and spiritless, and

<!-- Volume II, page 71 -->

you will find that a return to, or rather the adoption of a simple
and truthful policy in the management of your paper, for I cannot
find that anybody has ever tried such an experiment, will be
more startling and popular than any other course that you could
pursue.  At all events, I will not consent to follow any other;
and if you are not willing to employ me on such terms I will seek
some other business where starvation is not the penalty for speaking
the truth."</p>

<p>"But the difficulty will be, my young friend," said Mr. Wilton,
"to find any such employment, for I will confess to you
that I know of none that you would be likely to succeed in; the
world is so given to deceit; mankind have been so long accustomed
to being cheated that when one attempts to be more honest
than his neighbors, he is sure of being cried down as a humbug
or a fanatic.  If the press should once get to accusing me of
nursing an ism I should be ruined.  I couldn't make way against
it."</p>

<p>"What is that ism," said I, "that you fear so much, is it plagiarism,
for that is one of the worst that can be laid to the door
of a newspaper, I think."</p>

<p>"O! no, nothing of that sort," said he, "that is a kind of an
ism that happens to be popular; but they accuse an editor of
harboring an ism when they want to make an indefinite charge
against him which will cause the public to avoid his paper; it
has no particular meaning and therefore it is the more terrible,
as an object seen in a fog always appears more formidable than in
a clear atmosphere.  But I will confess to you that I am struck
by your proposition, and I think I will try it; I will have a
talk with my brother Bob, who has an interest in the paper, and
ought to be consulted, and then I will see what our Domine, Dr.
Dollarsworth, thinks of it.  And in the meantime you shall write
what you please, and we will see what effect it will have upon the
public; I rather think, that I shall come into the measure in the
end.  There now, is a heap of papers, just look them over and
see if you cannot find some subject to write about.  Be just as

<!-- Volume II, page 72 -->

candid, and as truthful as you please; be pointed, fresh and
slashing, and we will see how it affects the stomachs of the public.
But, by-the-way, speaking about stomachs, it has given me
a kind of cholic; if it should strike to a vital part the consequences
might be fatal.  I think, Mr. Pepper, that just for this
occasion, as I find there is a drop of that Glenlivet remaining
that I will mix a tumbler of punch for you and me and then I will
give it up forever.  One more taste, will do no particular harm,
of course, and I think that after so much earnest talk it will benefit
my system.  To-morrow we will begin the world anew and
give up the Glenlivet and take to telling the truth.  It will create
a tremendous excitement in Wall street, though; you may depend
upon it."</p>

<p>"Is truth, then, so rare a thing in Wall street," said I, "that
it will create more astonishment there than in any other
place?"</p>

<p>"I believe it will, upon my soul," said he, "and the fact is
that I fear its effects there the most, because I have there the
greatest number of subscribers.  But my brother Bob will be
able to tell me all about it.  Let us for the present drink up the
last of the Glenlivet.  <i>In vino veritas</i>, you know, is an old
maxim, so you will not object to just the merest drop of Glenlivet,
as it is for the last time."</p>

<p>"If there had been any truth in the maxim&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! very good. I know what you were going to
say, I should have been one of the most truthful of men.
Well, perhaps I am; at least, Mr. Pepper, no man ever yet
had the assurance to doubt my word."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilton having mixed his punch to his taste and drained
the last drop of Glenlivet from the bottle, leaned his head
back in his easy chair and in a very few moments began to
snore.</p>

<p>I had taken but a sip of the liquor, for although it had an extremely
pleasant flavor I had a great dread of becoming a tippler
from seeing the effect of drinking upon some of the people

<!-- Volume II, page 73 -->

with whom I had come in contact.  It was extremely flattering to
my pride to be taken into the confidence of so distinguished a
person as Mr. Wilton, and to feel that he deferred to my opinions;
and as the post of a public writer was one that seemed to be of
great dignity in the eyes of the public, I was most desirous of
pleasing Mr. Wilton that he might keep me as his assistant, but
I was resolved not to yield a hair's breadth of my determination
to be perfectly honest and candid in anything that I might write
for his paper.</p>

<p>It so happened that nothing occurred on the first day of my
engagement with Mr. Wilton calculated to test the effect of telling
the truth to the public.  I wrote a few paragraphs of no
great consequence, and I will confess that I experienced a degree
of pride on seeing my writing in print the next morning, that I
had never before felt on any occasion.  It was a delightful thought
to me to reflect that thousands of intelligent readers were actually
receiving impressions from me, and that among them were probably
those whom I loved and held in the highest esteem.  Knowing
the exact hour at which the morning paper was usually received
and read in the family of old Gil, and that Pauline generally
was the first to glance over it, reading, as young ladies are
wont to do, the marriages first, and then the dreadful accidents
of the day; I felt a thrill of strange pleasure at the thought that
she might be then reading my chance reflections, and I could not
help flattering myself that she would discover by some sympathetic
touch of feeling that I had written them.  Then again, I
knew that Mr. Bassett would be looking over the paper to discover
what I had written, and this too gave me a new sensation of delight,
but quite different from that which I felt in regard to Pauline.
This consciousness of communicating with, or rather
speaking to thousands of minds at the same time, and daily influencing
the thoughts of people whom I should never see, gave
me an exalted opinion of the importance of the position of a Journalist,
and caused me to feel more satisfied with myself than I
ever had before been.  A new sphere of life was opened to me,

<!-- Volume II, page 74 -->

and I was now more than ever impressed with the necessity of
cultivating a frank and truthful disposition.  If the mere tradesman,
or preacher, or mechanic, or farmer, whose influence is
confined to a small circle, is bound to be truthful and sincere in
his dealings with other people, how much more imperative is the
duty of truthfulness in the Journalist, whose influence is almost
unlimited.  I do not include the legal advocate, or lawyer, in the
category of those who are bound to be truthful, because it is his
professed business to make the wrong appear right, the right
wrong, to prevaricate, to suppress facts, to conceal frauds, to defend
evil, to give counsel to law-breakers, to screen the guilty, to
oppress the innocent, to mystify, quibble, and countenance subterfuges.
Lawyers being allowed to take bribes from rogues, and
suffered to live by screening the guilty from punishment, cannot,
of course, be ranked with men who are under a moral as well as
legal obligation to do right.  It is their vocation to disguise the
truth; they are a class by themselves to whom the law grants
the privilege of misrepresentation, and perhaps it is one of the
most melancholy evidences of the proneness of men to do wrong
that the profession of the law is more crowded than any other.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilton having expressed himself entirely satisfied with
what I had written, I entered at once upon my duties with ardor,
and with my mind filled with sublime thoughts of reforming the
world and remodeling society.  Nothing seemed to be more easy
than to produce a great moral revolution by the means of the pen.
As I had often been forcibly impressed by the inconsistencies between
the professions and actions of church members, and other
pious persons, I determined to make this subject the ground
work of my first leader.  It had not then occurred to me that
almost everybody was not only capable of scrutinizing his neighbor's
conduct and indicating his inconsistencies and failings, but
that everybody did so, and that such a feat would not be regarded
as very novel or startling in me; neither had it then occurred to
me that one of the surest and most efficient methods of reforming
the world is first to reform yourself.  Charity generally begins

<!-- Volume II, page 75 -->

at home, as she should, but the charity of reformers generally
begins abroad.</p>

<p>Considering myself in a situation which I should not very
soon change, I furnished a room adjoining the one occupied by
Mr. Wilton, and bargained with Sykes for my board.  I made
no particular agreement with Mr. Wilton about wages, feeling
quite sure that he would give me all the recompence that I
might be entitled to; I had but very little money, however, and
was obliged to get credit for the furniture of my room, which I
experienced no difficulty in doing.</p>

<p>After the appearance of the first paper on which I had employed
my talents, I was introduced to brother Bob, by Mr. Wilton.
Brother Bob was a very different looking person from
what I had expected to see; instead of being a wild, rattle-headed
fellow, he was an exceedingly grave-looking gentleman,
not far from fifty years old.  His hair was nearly white, he
dressed very much like a clergyman, wore a gold-headed cane,
and spoke in a deliberate, thoughtful manner.</p>

<p>"Brother Bob," said Mr. Wilton, pointing towards me as I sat
at my desk, "this is my new assistant, Mr. Tom Pepper."</p>

<p>I rose and bowed to him.</p>

<p>"Keep your seat, sir," said brother Bob; "I am glad to see
you and hope you will be able to agree with my brother."</p>

<p>"O, there's no danger of our disagreeing, brother Bob," said
Mr. Wilton; "Mr. Pepper and I understand each other pretty
well, although our acquaintance has been but a short one.  But,
by the way, that reminds me.  I want to ask your opinion,
brother Bob, on a very delicate question."</p>

<p>Brother Bob, on hearing this, put his cane upon the mantel-piece,
and taking off his hat, sat down and hemmed, as though
he was prepared to hear almost anything, and to give his opinion
without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pepper, here," continued Mr. Wilton, "has made a
rather embarrassing proposition to me in regard to the paper; he
professes to have a very nice sense of his obligations to speak the

<!-- Volume II, page 76 -->

truth on all occasions, and thinks it would be a good feature to
adopt into the paper.  What do you think of it, brother Bob,
would it be safe?  Do you think it will pay?"</p>

<p>"I think it a very excellent plan," replied brother Bob; "I
do not see what objections there can be to such a course; provided
of course that nothing is said against religion."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so," said Mr. Wilton, "for it is
just my way of thinking. I like the idea, and I think the novelty
of the thing will make considerable stir in Wall street.  We
may get some subscribers by it, and we shall be quite sure of
not losing any, for who will have the courage to confess himself
an enemy to truth?  By the way, brother Bob, give me a cigar.
What are these, Principes?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," said brother Bob; "you know that I don't
smoke, myself; but I generally put a handful in my hat at the
meetings of the board, for I like to have my share of plunder."</p>

<p>"Brother Bob is an Alderman, you must know, Mr. Pepper;
and he finds me in cigars at the public expense," said Mr.
Wilton; "and capital good cigars they are, too. Try one."</p>

<p>"Although you continue to smoke, I hope you have given up
drinking Glenlivet," said brother Bob, gravely.</p>

<p>"O, long since," said Mr. Wilton.  "I may sometimes take
a drop, as a medicine; but I mean to give it up as a drink altogether.
We are going on a new plan in the paper, and this will
be a good time to make a permanent change of habits."</p>

<p>Brother Bob commended this resolution, and paying me a
handsome compliment on my integrity, and wishing me success
in my new employment, he withdrew.</p>

<p>"I knew that he would approve of your plan," said Mr. Wilton,
"because he has lately become pious, and is, of course,
very favorable to any scheme for promoting the cause of truth."</p>

<p>I considered myself very fortunate in having fallen into the
hands of such excellent people, who so heartily entered into my
scheme; and I began my first leader on the inconsistencies of
the professedly pious, with the most high toned and exalted feeling

<!-- Volume II, page 77 -->

and soon completed an article I supposed would be the
means of placing me at the head of journalists, and gain me
the confidence and regard of the editor and brother Bob, both of
whom I was very desirous to please.  Mr. Wilton happened to be
out of his room when my leader was finished; I could not
submit it to him for his examination, and the printer's boy having
called for copy, I gave it to him, and it was set up and printed
off.  The next morning I read my leader with great satisfaction,
and felt myself of immense consequence, when I heard one gentleman
observe to another, in the bar-room at Sykes'.  "There's
a good deal of truth in that article about religion, in the &mdash;&mdash;
this morning; it will touch somebody on a sore spot."</p>

<p>Going back to the room of Mr. Wilton, to enjoy my triumph,
and receive his congratulations, I found the truth-loving editor
walking the floor in a state of great excitement, with the paper in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Pepper, you have ruined me," he exclaimed, as I entered.
"Brother Bob says he would not have had that article to appear
for ten thousand dollars.  We shall lose half our subscribers."</p>

<p>"Does it contain anything that is not strictly true," said I.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," replied Mr. Wilton, "but I did not suppose
that you meant to put such kind of truths into the paper."</p>

<p>As we were talking, a boy came in and delivered a note to
Mr. Wilton.</p>

<p>"There, there!" he exclaimed as he read the note; "It is
just what I expected.  Here is a note from old Gilson, ordering
his paper to be stopped.  Good heavens!  Pepper, I am a ruined
man; that leader of yours will lose us our best subscribers."</p>

<p>I could easily understand why old Gil had stopped his paper,
for I had, quite unconsciously, sketched some of his religious peculiarities
in my leader, and I was not a little mortified to find
that I should no longer have Pauline for one of my readers.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are not many more like old Gil," said I;
"the truth may not be quite so unpalatable to all; besides, a
truth which displeases one will be sure to please a good many."

<!-- Volume II, page 78 -->

<p>"But the worst of it is," said Mr. Wilton, "brother Bob
will have it that you meant him; and he will not consent to
your writing another line for the paper.  He says you are a dangerous
character, and insists on my discharging you immediately.
I must put in an apology to-morrow morning for your
plain speaking, or we shall not have a subscriber left on our
books."</p>

<p>The office boy here made his appearance, and handed another
note to Mr. Wilton, who read it with a falling countenance and
then handed it to me, saying: "there's another stoppage, from
one of the most high minded and honorable men in Wall street."
On reading the note I could not help smiling when I discovered
that it was written by my old friend Barton, the bank-president,
whose religious feelings had been shocked by my leader.  He,
too, ordered his paper to be stopped, and even returned the one
containing the obnoxious leader.</p>

<p>"I see now," said I, "what is understood by the influence of
the press; it means the influence of the subscribers to a paper.
Is not that it?"</p>

<p>"Why I am not sure but that it is, Pepper, after all," replied
Mr. Wilton.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure it is," said I; "the experience of this morning
has dissipated a very fine dream in which I have been indulging.
I see that I cannot be a newspaper editor if I would
preserve my individual integrity."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you are right. But the truth is, my dear fellow,
I fear that you are a little too impracticable for this world.
You may depend upon it that you must give up your high-toned
abstractions and come down to the level of common people if you
expect to have common fare in this world.  No individual has
any right to set himself up as a standard for all mankind.
There's my brother Bob, now, one of the most strictly conscientious
and pious men in Wall street; he was perfectly shocked at
your radical notions."</p>

<p>"But he said that he was delighted with my truthfulness," I

<!-- Volume II, page 79 -->

remarked, "and advised you to adopt my suggestions as to the
conduct of your paper."</p>

<p>"Of course he did; but he did not understand that we intended
to meddle with religion and offend the prejudices of our
subscribers," said Mr. Wilton; "I am sorry to part with you,
but really I am not yet prepared to starve, and I am very sure
that you would soon reduce me to that condition.  I couldn't
afford to dine at Sykes' if we published a leader every day like
that of yours this morning.  Independence is a very good
thing, and I must say that I like it very well in the abstract; but
when it comes to depriving a man of his dinner, it is not one of
those virtues that I feel myself under any moral necessity of cultivating."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, rising to go, and feeling a growing contempt
for Mr. Wilton in spite of his amiabilities, and his flattering
partiality for me, "my determination has been taken and I
will not swerve from it.  I will be true to my own convictions of
duty, let what will come of it.  Good heavens! sir, I could
starve with pleasure, if it were necessary, to preserve my integrity
of opinion.  I am young and vigorous, I have good health,
my wants are few, there are none dependent upon me for support,
to make me waver in my resolutions; and henceforth, with God's
blessing, which I hope for, I will live a true man."</p>

<p>Remembering my promise to Mr. Bassett, as soon as I quitted
the editorial office of Mr. Wilton, which I must confess I left with
a good deal of reluctance, for there was so much true manliness
in his character that I felt a very strong attachment to him, I hurried
to the store of my old friend and mentor, to tell him that
I was once more afloat in the world, and without any means for
earning my subsistence.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, laughing as he spoke,
"perhaps you will at last hit upon some business which will admit
of your telling the truth, without subjecting you to ruin."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said I, "but I almost despair of it.  If so good-hearted
and intelligent a person as Mr. Wilton finds it dangerous

<!-- Volume II, page 80 -->

to be truthful, I fear that I shall hardly fall in with anybody
willing to give me employment and allow me to speak my mind.
But I will try to find somebody."</p>

<p>"Persevere, and you will succeed," said Mr. Bassett.  "Mr.
Wilton is a very good and a very intelligent man, as you say;
but you must remember that it is his business to echo the falsehoods
of the world, not to proclaim new truths to it; and you
must not hastily conclude that all men are given to glozing over
the truth, because you happen to fall into the hands of one who
earns his daily bread by doing so."</p>

<p>"I am willing to be encouraged by what you say," I replied.
"I shall not give up my trust in the power of truth, for so slight
a reason; and now I must go out again into the streets and alleys
and seek for employment, before night, for I do not yet know
where my home will be to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That's bravely said, my boy," said Mr. Bassett; "and how
much money have you remaining in your pocket of what I gave
you last, for when a man goes on such a hazardous expedition as
you are bent upon, he wants something besides his resolution to
sustain him?"</p>

<p>"I have but three pistareens left," said I, exposing the contents
of my pockets, "and of them I have found that one is a
counterfeit."</p>

<p>"That's but a small capital to begin with," said he, "for one
who goes in search of a situation where he can be allowed the
privilege of speaking the truth.  Take these bills, my boy, and
if they should be exhausted before you find yourself a situation
to your mind, come to me again and I will give you more."</p>

<p>The bills that he offered me were three bank bills of the denomination
of ten dollars each, but I refused to receive them, upon
which he seemed annoyed and pressed them upon me.</p>

<p>"Take them, Tom," said he, "you do not know what difficulties
may befall you from not having money in your pocket.  I
shall feel uneasy respecting you, if you do not.  You have no
right to refuse me."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 81 -->

<p>But I had become infatuated with my resolution to depend upon
my own exertions for my support, and was determined to test
the experiment to the full, of dealing with all men with perfect
sincerity and truthfulness.  I had no desire of being a martyr,
but I felt something of that pride of opinion which has, probably,
influenced the majority of those who have courted martyrdom;
and feeling myself quite sufficient for myself, I was too proud to
accept assistance.</p>

<p>"You have often," said I, "strove to impress upon my mind
the importance of candor and open-heartedness, and I have suffered
too severely by neglecting the lessons that you taught me,
ever again to transgress.  I have lost my father by my falsehoods,
and it will be but a slight atonement to devote the remainder
of my life to the practice of entire truthfulness."</p>

<p>"But, my son," he said, endeavoring to force the bills into my
pocket, "that need not prevent your receiving aid from me;
there is no violation of truth in receiving money from one who
loves you.  Take it, my boy, lest, not having it, you be led to
commit the very error that you hope to guard against."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said I proudly, "it would be but a small merit in
me to preserve myself pure if I were not subject to temptations.
I shall trust to my principles, and if the world really be so bad
that an honest man cannot earn his living in it, then the sooner I
get out of it the better."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Tom," said he, looking me seriously in the face,
"that you do not in a moment of disappointment or anger, forget
your promise to me not to change your condition without informing
me of your intentions."</p>

<p>"I shall not forget it," said I.</p>

<p>"Remember, too," he said, again looking me seriously in the
face, "that no one has a right to selfishly regard his own feelings
alone; if there are others whose happiness depends upon your
conduct,  you must consult their feelings as well as your own."</p>

<p>"I shall not forget," I replied; "but those who feel the most
for me will be best pleased when I do that which promotes my

<!-- Volume II, page 82 -->

own happiness; so, in taking care of myself, I should confer the
most happiness on those who love me, if there be any such."</p>

<p>"If there be any such!" said Mr. Bassett, looking reproachfully
at me; "do you not know that there are such?"</p>

<p>"I hope there are," said I.</p>

<p>"You may be sure there are," said he.</p>

<p>As I was bent on looking for employment, and anticipated
with great delight the pleasure of eating a meal which was paid
for with my own earnings, I again shook hands with Mr. Bassett,
and left his store, with no settled purpose for the future, excepting
my determination to be honest, let it cost what it might,
and quite uncertain whither to turn.  Remembering that I had
left my penknife at Mr. Wilton's office, I called there for it, and
found a letter lying for me on his desk, directed in a hand which
was new to me, and opening I was surprised to discover that it
was written by a person of whom I had never heard before.
The note was as follows:</p>

<p>"My very dear Mr. Pepper, come and dine with me to-day,
at 4 o'clock.  I want to talk over a little business affair with
you.</p>

<p>Yours truly, and most friendly,<br/>

ARTHUR SLOPPERTON.<br/>

&mdash;&mdash; Hotel.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Strictly confidential."</p>

<p>I was a good deal puzzled by this extremely odd note, which
was written so very badly that I could with difficulty make it
out.  Mr. Wilton was not in his office, and I could not learn
where it came from, nor anything respecting Mr. Slopperton.
A suspicion crossed my mind at first that it might be some deeply
laid plot of those shallow gentlemen, Messieurs Riquets and
Pilfor, to entrap me into some kind of difficulty, for I had
heard they had both sworn to be revenged upon me for exposing
them at Sykes'.  But I was not in the least afraid of them, and
as Mr. Slopperton had invited me to one of the best hotels in the
city, I had little cause to fear any danger in so respectable a
place; so I determined to go and see who Mr. Slopperton was,

<!-- Volume II, page 83 -->

as I should save the cost of my dinner by accepting his invitation.
But what business could a gentleman have with me to
whom I was an entire stranger?  This question kept popping
into my thoughts all day, so that I could hardly divert my mind
to any other subject.  I busied myself until near the appointed
time for meeting Mr. Slopperton, in seeking for employment, but
without success, and as the clock struck four, I entered the bar-room
of the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel, and inquired for my new acquaintance;
the waiter showed me into a private parlor, which was
furnished in a very sumptuous manner.  I did not perceive as I
entered that there was any person in it, but as I advanced to the
centre of the room, a gentleman rose from the crimson velvet sofa
on which he was lying, and seizing me by the hand, said:</p>

<p>"Well, how are you? how are you?  Punctual to the hour.
I like that.  Come, sit down, I am devilish glad to see you.  How
are you?  It is Mr. Pepper, isn't it?"</p>

<p>All this was said with so much heartiness and apparent good
feeling, that I was at once most favorably impressed with my new
friend; but I was more than ever astonished to be received in
such a manner by a total stranger.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Slopperton?" said I.</p>

<p>"O! of course I am.  Didn't you expect to see me here.  I
should be devilish sorry to find anybody else taking possession of
my apartments.  Come, Antoine, spread the table; what are you
looking at? let us have dinner immediately."</p>

<p>This was said to the waiter, who immediately disappeared and
directly after began to spread the table and bring in the dinner.</p>

<p>"Well.  And how have you been?  I am devilish glad to see
you," again said Mr. Slopperton.  "How are you?  I like you.
There is a deep vein in you, a&mdash;a&mdash;a man-of-the-worldish air I
like.  I am always open, candid and sincere with people I take a
liking to.  I like your general style and making up; there's
such a devilish gentlemanly-mannered way about you."</p>

<p>Mr. Slopperton gave me no opportunity to reply to him or demand
any explanation, but kept running on with great volubility,

<!-- Volume II, page 84 -->

repeating how well he liked me, and reminding me of the good
points in my character which had captivated his fancy.  But if
I had no opportunity to ask an explanation of his conduct, and
of his motives in sending for me, I had sufficient time to scan his
person and form an estimate of his character.  He was a dark-haired
gentleman of the middle height, and a rather slender person,
dressed in the extreme of the fashion, and with great niceness
and precision.  His clothes rather manifested a full pocket
than good taste; they were rich and fashionable, and he wore
considerable diamond jewelry, a very showy gold watch chain,
and a most obtrusive seal ring on his finger; but the colors
of his clothes were badly chosen, and nothing but his extreme
cleanliness and the richness of his apparel saved him from appearing
vulgar and common.  He stooped in his gait and his
eyes were dark and heavy.  In spite of his vivacity, he was
dull and spiritless in his manner, and he had the appearance of
being worn out.  His complexion was very pale and when he
stopped speaking, his features were dull and the expression of
countenance was that of weariness and ennui.  His room was
furnished with upholstery of the most sumptuous description, but,
like his dress, it indicated a distressing want of taste.  The curtains,
the sofas, the lounges, the chairs, and the carpet, were of
all ill-assorted colors, and composed of such heavy and rich materials
that they conveyed a sensation of oppressiveness.  Although
there two large mirrors on the walls in heavy gilt
frames, there was a full length psyche glass in a richly carved
frame standing in a corner of the room.  The pictures which
hung upon the walls were bad copies from some of the voluptuous
female heads of Titian and Rubens; and there was a portfolio
of gaudily colored French prints on the centre table; there
was a small book-case in the room which contained a few books
in rich bindings with gilded backs; they were principally
French authors, and instead of Le Diable Amoureux, and the
novels of Paul De Kock, De Balzar, and books of a similar class
which I expected to see, they proved to be chiefly

<!-- Volume II, page 85 -->

on political economy and various other subjects of a kindred
nature.</p>

<p>The dinner having been brought in and placed upon the
table while he was telling me how he liked me, and how
devilish glad he was to see me, and asking me how I was, and
how I had been, before I had an opportunity of asking how he
knew anything at all about me, and on what occasion he had
ever seen me, he asked me to be seated at the table.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed to confess to the weakness of liking a
good dinner; like charity, it covers a multitude of sins; and,
let my mysterious friend's taste in dress and furniture have
been what it might, I am bound to do him the justice to say
that his taste in ordering a dinner was beyond reproach.  I
never sat down to a more beautiful <i>tableau</i> than that which his
centre table presented.  It was a delicious picture of still
life, in which there were no incongruities to offend the eye, or
tricks to deceive the judgment; the whole affair showed consummate
art, and, as they say in the newspapers, reflected
the highest credit upon the accomplished <i>artistes</i> under whose
superintendence it was arranged.  But my admiring friend
rather unsettled my opinion of his judgment on such affairs
by beginning to apologize for not having something more suitable
for me.</p>

<p>The remarks of Mr. Slopperton were so direct and complimentary
that they neither gave me a better opinion of myself
than I had before entertained, nor a very exalted one of himself.
It was very easy to perceive that Mr. Slopperton "had an axe
to grind," and that he required my aid in turning the grind-stone,
but how or in what manner I could be useful to such a person I
could not conceive, and I was extremely curious to find out how
he became acquainted with me.  What puzzled me most of all
was his continually complimenting me upon being "such a
devilish gentlemanly-mannered man," for I had never taken any
pains to cultivate those peculiar graces of manner which are supposed
to belong exclusively to the class of persons called gentlemen.

<!-- Volume II, page 86 -->

In fact I was sensible that a lack of their graces was more
likely to be remarked in me than their presence.  But I discovered
afterwards that Mr. Slopperton was only endeavoring to
conciliate me by bestowing upon me the kind of praise which
would have been most agreeable to himself.  But he got no return
for his compliments, for I soon discovered that he was very
far from bring gentlemanly-mannered, and that he was quite
aware of his deficiencies in this particular.  Mr. Slopperton
made the very common mistake of thinking that everything could
be procured for money, but was woefully disappointed when he
attempted to purchase that which he most needed, which was
self-respect; as this was something that no money could procure
him, and he found that upholstery, jewelry and fine clothes, could
no more gain him the admiration of the world than they could
do the same for the shop-keepers of whom he had purchased
them, he had conceived a new plan for gaining the esteem which
all his efforts had hitherto failed to secure.</p>

<p>Poor Slopperton!  With a handsome fortune, a well-made
person, and a tolerably good college education, he had not learned
the art of enjoying life.  In spite of all the trappings with which
he had surrounded himself, and all the luxurious appliances at
his command, he was still wretchedly unhappy because he could
not get rid of the conviction that he was nobody.  He would have
been perfectly willing to exchange all his wealth for the honest
feeling of self-sufficiency which many a hod-carrier possessed.
It was some time before he confessed to me his object in inviting
me to dine with him; but I discovered his motive long before he
acknowledged it.  When we first sat down to dinner something
like the following conversation passed between us:</p>

<p>"I am rather <i>blase</i> you see.  I dare say some people think
me a mere trifler; quite a man of the world, and nothing more.
But they'll find out all about me one of these days.  Don't you
think they will, ha?"</p>

<p>"Very likely, people generally get to be pretty well known
to those who come in contact with them."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 87 -->

<p>"Faith that's a devilish shrewd remark of yours, Pepper,
devilish shrewd.  By the way, what an insight you have into
character."</p>

<p>"The fricandeau is capital," said I.</p>

<p>"O! hang the fricandeau.  Come, now, that's one of your
deep man&oelig;uvres.  What's the meaning of it?"</p>

<p>"I meant nothing more than I said," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!  Very well, indeed!  Bravo!  Let me give
you just another drop of this wine. It's Chateau Margaux, or
some such devilish stuff, that I got from my friend Lynch.  By
the way, I'll introduce you to him.  Fine fellow&mdash;knows every
body in Europe&mdash;George the Fourth, and everybody of that
sort.  I'll give you a letter to the king when you go to Europe,
our minister to the Court of St. James, <i>attache</i>, lots of duchesses,
opera girls, and all such trifles. By the way, you'll appear
devilish well in Europe with that piquant, free, candid, gentlemanly
manner of yours.  Antoine, bring on your game, or some
such nonsense of that sort, partridges, woodcock, canvas backs,
or something of that sort; any trifle; I don't care what. You like
game?"</p>

<p>"Particularly well," said I, "and all the better for not having
eaten any this season.  Moreover, if you had not invited me to
dine with you I should probably have been forced to stay my
stomach with dry rusk in a baker's shop."</p>

<p>"What a confession!  What a devilish piquant way you have
of telling the truth.  It's just what I like.  There's a style
about what you say, a sprightly, sincere, candid air about you
that's devilish fresh and delightful. What a happy fellow
you must be.  Now you think me an aristocrat. and all that sort
of thing; but the fact is, Pepper, I am heart and soul with the
masses, like yourself.  What do you think I am going to do
now?"</p>

<p>"Apprentice yourself to a butcher, perhaps," said I.</p>

<p>"Devilish good; ha! ha! ha!  Not quite so bad as that, but
almost, I am going to Congress.  What do you think of it?"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 88 -->

<p>"I think you will be going a long while before you get there,"
said I, upon which his countenance looked more blank than
ever.</p>

<p>"You do?  But wait and see; I have laid my plans devilish
deep; nothing more easy than to get into Congress; don't you see
what blockheads get there every day."</p>

<p>"Very true; but you are not the kind of blockhead to accomplish
such a feat, I think."</p>

<p>"You think so!  Ha! ha! ha!  I have already bought up
three editors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who will, of course, be bought up by somebody else to-morrow.
Editors who can be bought are not worth buying."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Pepper, I see you are quite a novice.  Immense
Power of the Press, lever of public opinion, they can do
anything; I have got them bound hand and foot.  I am quite a
man of the world, you see; make it for a man's interest and he
will do anything.  Money is the secret.  No mistake about that.
See how I will have all the readers on my side.  I'll identify
myself with them; make a democrat of myself, make speeches
in Tammany Hall, shake hands with everybody, hail fellow
well met every where.  Don't you see!"</p>

<p>"And pray what is your motive for wanting to go to Congress?
It is an odd fancy."</p>

<p>"To serve my country.  To be useful to mankind.  You
don't think I care anything about patronage, or political distinction;
or that I would give the toss of a penny to see myself
called the Honorable so-and-so; no, no; nothing of that sort.  I
am above all that sort of thing.  All I want is an opportunity to
do good; to be serviceable to my country; and be looked up to
as a man of&mdash;that is, a man who does good to mankind, makes
laws and all that."</p>

<p>"It's a very easy thing to do good without going to Congress,"
said I; "and, in fact, there is so very little good done there that
it strikes me the safer way would be to keep out of Congress if
it's your aim to do good."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 89 -->

<p>"Ha! ha! what a devilish gentlemanly way you have of saying
sarcastic things.  If I had your talents, now, I might be justified
in going to Congress to display them.  But, come, let's put
your doctrine home to you.  Some Heidsick?  It's good, is it?"</p>

<p>"Superb."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it is fair; so, so; but I care nothing about
such trifles; however, my aim is to mingle among honorable men."</p>

<p>"Men called Honorable," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good again.  Devilish sarcastic, though; now,
my good fellow, I shall begin to think, by and by, that you have
been soured by the world."</p>

<p>"Soured by the world!  No, the world has no power to
sour me.  Because I speak the truth you think it is because I am
soured in my feelings; but no, it is owing to my excessive good
nature that I speak so plainly.  If I were sour, I would lie and
flatter, and laugh in my sleeve at the credulity of the world as
knaves and humbugs.  But, I love the world too well to deceive
it by any false devices.  Do you think you could be guilty of
double dealing towards anybody whom you loved?"</p>

<p>"There is a devilish sight of truth in what you say, I must
confess," said Mr. Slopperton, trying to look solemn and important;
"but, my dear fellow, all your words are like acidulated
drops, so made up of sugar and lemon that it is difficult to tell
whether they are sweet or sour.  Ha! ha! ha!  I have you
there, ha?"  And he shut one eye and looked at me knowingly
with the other, as though he were trying to impress me with the
force of his brilliant sally.</p>

<p>"Very good," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, that's encouraging.  Come now, my dear fellow, let
us proceed to business."</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears at the mention of business, for I had
been so much amused with the oddities of my entertainer that I
had forgotten that I was ignorant of his object in sending for me.
"Very good," said I; "if you have any business matters to arrange
with me I shall be most happy to know it, for business is

<!-- Volume II, page 90 -->

precisely the thing that I am in pursuit of.  But pray what business
can you have with a person whom you never saw before,
and can know but little about.  But perhaps it is something concerning
my father," I exclaimed, as the thought suddenly occurred
to me; "if so, speak quickly I beg of you."</p>

<p>"No, no, nothing of the kind.  The fact is, my fine fellow,
that I know you devilish well, better than you think for.  How
I came by my knowledge of you is no matter, at least, not now.
I am quite a man of the world, you see, indifferent to money and
such trifles and all that sort of thing; but I want to use you and
am willing to pay you devilish well."</p>

<p>"I shall be but too happy to serve you in anything that is honorable,"
I said, "provided you pay me for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's strictly honorable, of course; I am incapable of proposing
anything base to you, you know, of course.  But, I like
your precaution, vastly.  It strengthens my good opinion of you,
and, in fact, confirms the high idea I had formed of your character
for ingenuousness, honesty and all that, you know.  You
are such a devilishly unique fellow, now, that a man of the
world, like myself, cannot be altogether prepared for you.  What
an excellent talent you have, by the way, for a diplomat.  I can
get you an appointment, if you wish, to the Court of St. James,
St. Cloud, or any other Saint you may like.  Faith, you are
quite the man of the nineteenth century, piquant, deep, brilliant,
comprehensive, and so devilishly refined and finished."</p>

<p>These compliments were poured upon me so thickly and rapidly,
that I began to be annoyed by them; so said I&mdash;"But the
business, let us arrange the business, I am anxious to be employed."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, to be sure." said he, filling my glass with sherry;
"try a glass of this Amontillado, first; it will soothe your
nerves and assist your digestion; then we will have a cup of
coffee.  Antoine, bring the coffee, a glass of liqueur, noyeau, or
maraschino, or something in that way; and then a cigar, and
then we will go regularly to work.  It's only a trifling affair;

<!-- Volume II, page 91 -->

you will laugh at me I know.  But I shall pay you well.  I am
a man of the world you know, and understand perfectly well
that something cannot be had for nothing; or ought not, at least.
I am a philosopher you see, and understand perfectly well the
whole routine of trade, although I may seem like a mere superficial
sort of a trifler to a chance observer.</p>

<p>"Some people say," continued Mr. Slopperton, growing more
and more familiar, "I am a remarkable man, to be sure, and all
that; and Lord Brougham, Webster, and Dr. Chalmers, and men
of that class, have complimented me on my character."</p>

<p>"Have they, indeed," I exclaimed; "that is remarkable."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" said he; "but what do I care for compliments
from such humbugs as they are.  A compliment from you, now,
mixed up with some of those devilish nice acidulated drops that
you let fall so gracefully, would be something to a fellow.  What
I want is the honest truth, and nothing more."</p>

<p>"O, then, they were not sincere in what they said about you?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, I won't say that.  Brougham is a good fellow in
his way, and so is Webster; I wouldn't like to charge them with
duplicity, you know.  But, they are men of the world, and they
are lawyers too, and lawyers you know get in the habit of lying
from taking fees professionally, to suppress the truth.  But this
brings me to the point at once.  The truth is, my dear fellow,
I have found out from my friend Barton, my banker, too, by-the-way,
all about you."</p>

<p>I blushed at the mention of Mr. Barton's name, I must admit,
not from any guilty feeling, but because I suspected that he had
told my unaccountable acquaintance the particulars of my intimacy
with Miss Gilson.  Mr. Slopperton perceived my momentary
confusion, and began to laugh in his vapid way.</p>

<p>"Blushing! ha! ha!  Well, my good fellow, I like it in you;
it's devilish piquant and pleasant."</p>

<p>"And so," said I, "Mr. Barton told you all about me&mdash;all that
he knew, I suppose&mdash;but he don't know much about me; nor
nothing that I would not have told you myself."

<!-- Volume II, page 92 -->

<p>"O, of course not," said Mr. Slopperton.  "Barton is a
devilish spiritual, piquant, pleasant fellow; he told me nothing
that he should not have told, and if I had not heard from him
what a devilish gentlemanly-mannered man you are, I would not
have sent for you on this business.  Not I.  I know too much
about the world for that, you will find.  Quite too much, altogether."</p>

<p>"Very good," said I, rather impatiently, for I was beginning
to grow tired of hearing myself called a devilish piquant, gentlemanly-mannered
dear fellow, and of being informed by Mr.
Slopperton that he was quite a man of the world&mdash;it would be but
a sorry compliment to the world, though, to believe Mr. Slopperton
what he represented himself; "Very good," said I, "but I
am getting weary.  Will you be so kind as to inform me of your
object in sending for me to dine with you, and let me be off?"</p>

<p>"O! that's exquisite!" exclaimed my entertainer, greatly to
my astonishment.  "Capital! delicious!" and he rubbed his
hands together with great glee, and leaping up from his chair
danced round the table and clasped me round the neck with such
earnestness as to nearly choke me.</p>

<p>I was by this time nearly convinced that Mr. Slopperton was a
lunatic, but his eye was so dull and heavy, and he so easily sank
back into his chair and resumed his old manner, that I saw he was
not exactly insane of mind.</p>

<p>"You are such an extraordinary person," said he as he resumed
his seat, "so devilishly remarkable and piquant, that you must
overlook my warmth of manner.  What a genius you are.  Barton,
confound him, did not half prepare me for such a devilish
extraordinary fellow.  You are worth a mint of money to me.
I haven't had such a delicious sensation this month.  You are better
than a new prima donna.  Wine?"</p>

<p>"No, no," I exclaimed, putting up my hand, "I have eaten
and drank enough."</p>

<p>"And heard enough, too.  Ha?" said Mr. Slopperton, rubbing
his hands together.  "And so you are beginning to get weary of

<!-- Volume II, page 93 -->

me?  Well, that's delicious.  You see I know how to appreciate
you, my dear fellow; your frankness is so devilishly piquant,
that I am really enchanted with you.  Faith, if you ever get
into your baronetcy what a sensation you will make among those
devilish <i>distingue</i> aristocrats in England.  Confound them all,
say I!  You see my sympathies are all with the masses, and the
down-trodden millions, and all that sort of thing, my dear
fellow."</p>

<p>"My baronetcy!" I exclaimed; "ah! there's little chance of
anything like that for me.  I shall be but too happy, if I can but
earn my bread and butter honestly, without sighing after a fortune
which I have lost by my wicked folly."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about earning your bread and butter, my dear
fellow," said he, "while you have that devilish remarkable
talent of yours for telling the truth so piquantly; it will be a
mine of wealth to you.  You will become one of the most <i>distingue</i>
men in town, and all the women will be running after you
to hear you talk.  But to business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To business then, let me entreat you.  I am impatient to be
gone.  My time, probably, is worth more to me than yours is to
you."</p>

<p>"Not a bit, my good fellow, not a bit.  I will pay you well
for every moment you spend with me.  You shall name your
own price.  I am not quite a millionaire, to be frank with you,
Pepper, but I have got enough for both of us, and while I have a
crust of bread you shall never go hungry.  Everything I have
is at your disposal.  My wardrobe, library, cigars, bank-book,
all but Sophie, but never mind about her.  And now to business.
You see, my dear fellow, as I was saying to you just now, my
friend Barton, who is also my banker, and one of the most devilishly
agreeable men about town, has told me all about you; so
that will save you the trouble of making any <i>expose</i> of your
private history to me.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," said I, "for I had made up my mind not to
tell you anything about it to-night."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 94 -->

<p>"Very good.  That's capital.  I owe you something for that.
Delicious!" exclaimed Mr. Slopperton again, rubbing his hands
with unfeigned delight.  "Everything you say confirms what my
friend Barton told me about you.  But, as I was saying, I know
all about you, now you shall know all about me, and then we
shall understand each other the better."</p>

<p>"But if that is all the business you have with me," said I,
rising from my chair, "I had better go, for I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better and better!" exclaimed Mr. Slopperton, again jumping
from his seat and clasping me in his arms.  "Exquisite!
Delicious!"</p>

<p>So, seeing that I had no other recourse but to sit still and wait
for the gradual development of Mr. Slopperton's secret business,
I sat down again, resolved to allow him to have things his own
way; it was growing late, and it was now a matter of indifference
to me where I spent the remainder of the night. So I
merely said to him, "Very well, my friend, if you will have
me to remain until morning, I shall not quarrel with you.  But
truly your conduct is so strange that I am rather impatient to
learn the cause of it."</p>

<p>"You think it strange, ha?" said he, as if surprised.</p>

<p>"Very," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a devilishly piquant fellow, as my friend Barton
said, and I like you the better for it.  But let's to business.
We must have some more coffee first.  Antoine!  Why the fellow
is asleep on an ottoman.  Confound the devilishly luxurious rascal,
I shall have to discharge him from my service."</p>

<p>A well directed hickory nut having hit Antoine upon his forehead,
and roused that saffron colored personage from his slumber,
we had a fresh pot of coffee, and greatly to my relief Mr.
Slopperton braced himself up in his chair and began to talk in a
more coherent and earnest manner than he had done at any time
before.</p>

<p>"The fact is, my dear fellow," said he, once more, "you are
just the man I have long been in search of.  I have been going

<!-- Volume II, page 95 -->

through the world like what's his name, the old fellow with the
lantern, in search of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark! hush!"  I exclaimed, jumping from my seat and
overturning Antoine, who stood behind me with the coffee-pot in
his hand.</p>

<p>"What in God's name has happened, my dear fellow," said
Mr. Slopperton, with alarm in his countenance, as he too started
from his chair.</p>

<p>But I has no time to make any explanations; without looking
for my hat, or stopping to say another word, I jumped to the
door, and ran along the gallery into which it opened; but in my
hurry I turned in the wrong direction, and instead of finding
myself at the top of the stair-way which led to the principal entry
below, I found myself at the head of a narrow pair of stairs
which communicated with the kitchen of the Hotel.  Discovering
my mistake at a glance, I turned back, and in my haste to get
below, came very near knocking Mr. Slopperton down stairs, for
he had followed me out to enquire the cause of my sudden flight.
Shoving him aside, I jumped down the broad stair-way, and entered
the bar-room which was so filled with tobacco smoke that I
could not distinguish the faces of the people who were present,
at a glance, but it did not require long time to satisfy me that the
object of my pursuit was not there.  I asked the bar-keeper if a
gentleman had entered the bar-room within a few minutes.</p>

<p>He had seen no one.</p>

<p>I glanced on the register, but could not find the name I searched
for, and immediately ran into the street, which was nearly deserted,
for it was now quite late, and looked in vain for the form
I longed once more to behold.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader will remember that I have alluded to the
very remarkable tone of Captain St. Hugh's voice, or at least
of its remarkable sound to me.  He had a peculiar dry cough,
which could not be mistaken for the voice of any other person by
anybody who had once heard it; and to me, who had so often
listened to it, and in whose ears it sounded sweeter than music,

<!-- Volume II, page 96 -->

it could not fail to be distinguished among a thousand voices.
Just as Mr. Slopperton commenced his explanation, I heard the
same dry, quick cough, apparently of a person passing his room
door; it made my heart leap with delight as the sound fell upon
my ear, for I knew that it was my father's voice, or, at least, I
thought so, and this will explain the cause of my sudden movement,
for I rushed out with the confident expectation of seeing
my father in the hall.  But I was miserably disappointed, and
after inquiring at the bar if any person lived at the Hotel resembling
Captain St. Hugh, I returned to Mr. Slopperton so depressed
in my feelings that I could hardly sit and listen to him while
he told me his strange reasons for seeking my acquaintance.</p>

<p>I was not given to waking dreams, and was but little subject to
superstitious fancies; but being satisfied that Captain St. Hugh
had not been in the Hotel, I could not help thinking that it was
his spirit that I had heard, for the fact of my hearing his voice
was too strongly impressed upon my mind to be doubted.  It had
just become fashionable again to believe in ghosts, and the inter-communication
of the spirits of the living and the departed, and I
had heard so many stories told of the mesmerizers, and the wonders
of clairvoyance, that I could not dismiss from my thoughts
the idea that something fearful had happened to my father, or
was about to happen to me.  It will be seen, in the end, what
cause I had for such apprehensions, but I must not now anticipate
my story by making any revelations out of the proper place.</p>

<p>There was certainly some great mystery connected with Capt.
St. Hugh's strange disappearance; his neglect to inform me of
his designs, and his total abandonment of me after having been
at such great pains to find me.  When I remembered the circumstances
under which I had, as I thought, seen him in the street,
and my losing sight of him, I no longer doubted that I had, in
reality seen his spirit, and I felt more sad and sorrowful, than I
had done before since I woke upon my mother's breast, and
found that while I had unconsciously slept there, her spirit had
fled forever.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 97 -->

<p>"Good Heavens! my dear fellow," exclaimed Mr. Slopperton,
as I returned to his room, "what a change in your countenance!
Pray what was the cause of this odd freak of yours.  Is
it only one of your devilish piquant little ways, or was it something
really existing?  Let me know all about it."</p>

<p>But I had no heart to make any explanations to Mr. Slopperton;
he was not the kind of person to whom I could confide my
sorrows, and I therefore begged that he would go on with his
story at the point where I had interrupted him, and not take any
further notice of my abrupt departure from his room.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well.  It is rather piquant and pleasant, rather
<i>outre</i>, but it helps to diversify life, and makes something of a
sensation.</p>

<p>"But, by-the-way, where was I?  O, I remember going
about like old what's his name among the classics, with a lantern
in my hand, looking for a devilishly piquant, honest intelligent
fellow like yourself.  And I have found you at last, and mean to
make your fortune."</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>MR. SLOPPERTON EXPLAINS HIMSELF.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. SLOPPERTON made so awkward an attempt to let himself out,
as he expressed it, and seemed so much at a loss how to begin
his explanation, that I began to suspect he had been guilty of
some piece of villainy, and wanted me to assist in keeping the secret
for him; but he had not the energy to be a rascal, although,
as I afterwards found, he did not lack the inclination.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, my dear fellow," he repeated again, "I have been
looking all my life for a devilish honest, truth-loving, candid,
discriminating, clever fellow, like yourself, and I never found one
until I stumbled upon you.  My friend Barton told me about
you, and I said at once, he's my man."</p>

<p>To be just to Mr. Slopperton, I believe he thought me to be all
he said.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 98 -->

<p>"Now, my dear fellow, you must know I have always had a
plenty of money.  I have travelled in Europe, I have been feted,
and dined, and educated in polite learning, I have been sought
after by men, and courted by women; I might have married
splendid girls, first families, brilliant connections, great estates,
and every thing of that sort, but nothing of the kind pleases me;
I could see through them all.  It was not me they wanted, my
dear fellow, but my money.  Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I can easily imagine it to be so," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, that's capital!  That's encouraging, Pepper.  Only
keep it up.  But what man of generous impulses, or a soul to
save, wants to be courted for the sake of his money? I would
sooner be a beggar, Pepper, and receive a good, honest, hearty,
well-meant kick, from every other man I meet, than to be so
fawned upon and run after by a pack of heartless rascals, who
care for nothing but my money."</p>

<p>"I should think so," said I, "but surely you must sometimes
have met with an honest friend?"</p>

<p>"Never, never," said he, "and the strangest part of the thing
is, that I never gave any of the rascals anything in my life, and
yet they will run after me.  Catch me giving them any money!
No, no, I know better than that; I should be worse off than ever
if I did.  It would be like holding out a piece of meat to induce
a pack of hungry dogs to quit you.  I know by myself that no
man esteems me more for having money than if I were poor; for
I know that I do not care the value of a broken tumbler for what
a man has, but for what he is."</p>

<p>"And yet," said I, "you choose for your associates the rich
rather than the poor."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," said he, "I don't choose anybody.
They all choose me.  Don't you see that I have invited you to
dine with me, and you are not rich, according to your own confession;
but you are honest, and that is better.  Everybody
flatters me; my tailor tells me I have a devilish fine figure, and
for that matter, Pepper, it isn't bad, but why tell me of it?  Do

<!-- Volume II, page 99 -->

you think he would if he didn't charge for it in his devilish exorbitant
bill?"</p>

<p>"Probably not," said I.</p>

<p>"Of course he wouldn't, and I know it, too; and so I make
him discount twenty-five per cent every time he brings in his
account.  They don't get the advantage of me, Pepper, with all
their flattery.  Look at my portrait up there now, see how it's
flattered.  That fellow, McGilp, the artist who painted it, has
given me a devilishly brilliant red and white complexion, when
you see I am almost yellow, but to tell the truth, Pepper, I was
rather fresh when I sat to him; he has given me a pair of eyes
as black and bright as an angel's, and the most devilishly piquant
smile you ever saw on a man's face.  There's nothing like it on
mine, you see."</p>

<p>"Then why did you hang the portrait up in your room, and
pay the lying painter for misrepresenting you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is, the picture is not altogether unlike me, and
as Barton said it was devilish good, what could I do?  But, they
are all alike.  I can get no truth out of a living soul, and I was
going to give up the search and turn misanthrope, and curse the
hollow-hearted world all the rest of my life, when I happened to
complain to Barton, and he told me that you were my man."</p>

<p>"It was very good of him," I said, "for I did not think he
entertained a particularly good opinion of me."</p>

<p>"Well, that is odd, to be sure," said Mr. Slopperton, with a
puzzled look, "for he told me that if I found fault with every
body for their deceitfulness, I should seek out that most remarkably
truthful gentleman, Tom Pepper, who would be sure to
please me; and a hard time I had to find you, my dear fellow.
And now I will tell you my scheme. I will put myself in your
keeping.  I will tell you all my secrets, all my hopes, aspirations,
and aims; you shall read me as you would a book, and tell me,
like an honest critic, if there ever were such a person, exactly
what you think of me."</p>

<p>"But I may not be willing to read you, for you may prove a

<!-- Volume II, page 100 -->

very disagreeable book to me, which I may not consider worth
criticizing?" I said.</p>

<p>"Ah!  But you will for money?"</p>

<p>"If I can find no better employment, perhaps I may?"</p>

<p>"I will pay you well, provided you are true to me.  I don't
expect to have your services for nothing.  You don't care anything
at all about me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do not."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he exclaimed, rubbing his hands together, "and you
rather despise me than otherwise?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good!  And of course you wouldn't even take the trouble to
tell me of my faults unless I paid you well."</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"Better and better!  So I shall at least spend some of my
money with the satisfaction of getting the full value for it.  I
will pay you well, my dear fellow, if you don't spare me; tell
me of all my weaknesses and follies, all my vices, but them I know
pretty well myself, by the way.  Reflect me like a mirror."</p>

<p>"And you will consult me as often, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you have said it."</p>

<p>"And, like your mirrors, set me in a frame work of gold."</p>

<p>"Excellent!  What a devilishly piquant fellow you are.  I
will give you a check on Barton, for a thousand dollars, at once.
Antoine, bring my desk."</p>

<p>Antoine placed a small writing desk before him, and, taking
out his check-book, he did actually write an order upon the Bank
of which Mr. Barton was president, payable to my order, for a
thousand dollars. I thought he must be a lunatic, but he appeared
so cool and collected that I saw he was in earnest, and
putting the check in my pocket, I told him he might consider my
services at his command, and that I would begin to repay my
obligations by assuring him that I thought him one of the most
ridiculous men I had yet encountered.</p>

<p>"That will do in a general way," said he, "but that is not

<!-- Volume II, page 101 -->

exactly the style of criticism that I want. I must have something
more definite and particular.  Why am I ridiculous?  What
particular thing do you see in me that makes you form that
opinion of me?"</p>

<p>I told him that it would take so much time to analyze him
entirely that he must be content to take my opinion of him in
detail, as the nature of his thoughts or actions were developed
to me.</p>

<p>"The very thing I want, my dear fellow.  You are an angel to
me.  But, of course, you will find some good in me?" said he.</p>

<p>I assured him that if I did, he should have the benefit of the
discovery.</p>

<p>Mr. Slopperton seemed really grateful to me, and appeared
to enjoy my candor excessively; he furthermore revealed to me
an ambitious scheme which he had planned for hearing himself
abused in the most satisfactory manner, by getting himself nominated
for Congress.  I told him that he could not have adopted
a better plan for getting himself slandered, than by setting up for
some public office, for if he had a character as pure as an angel's,
and were possessed of the wisdom of Washington, he would be
sure of being reviled worse than a thief by all the newspapers
opposed to him in politics.</p>

<p>"That will do very well as far as it goes," said he, "but I am
not covetous of abuse.  What I want is the truth; if people must
lie about me, I must confess, my dear fellow, that I would prefer
they should speak well of me, rather than evil.  But it must be
devilishly piquant to read whole columns of abuse of yourself in
a newspaper.  It must give one a devilishly delightful sensation
to know that you are of consequence enough to the world for
men to sit down and invent lies about you.  I have been trying
to write a book, so that I might get abused by the critics."</p>

<p>"And couldn't you succeed?" said I.</p>

<p>"No.  It was the worst speculation I ever tried.  I spent a year,
sweating over the devilish thing; I sat up late at night, I let forth
the most moral theories in political philosophy; I invented a new

<!-- Volume II, page 102 -->

system of politics and wove into my book a good many devilishly
sly and piquant infidelities, exactly like the same things which
had made Hume, and Voltaire, and Rousseau so notorious; I had
the book published by the most respectable publishing house, and
a devilish sight of money it cost me too, for advertising; but after
all my trouble and expense, nobody would ever consent to abuse
the book or its author.  There seemed to be a conspiracy among
the critics to let me alone.  All the notice it ever received was
from the daily papers, every one of them declaring, in the most
remarkably unanimous manner, that the imprint of the publisher
was a sufficient guaranty of its merit, and that no gentleman's
library could be considered complete without it; and every gentleman
seemed to regard this as a sufficient warning to keep it
out of his library, for not a single copy was ever sold, except by
the editors who sent their presentation copies to the Auction
Rooms."</p>

<p>"So you wisely abandoned the foolish attempt to gain notoriety
by writing a book, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Of course I did, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>"And now you are going into polities, where you will not succeed
much better," said I. "You will probably get abuse
enough, if you should be able to buy a nomination for any office,
but nothing else."</p>

<p>"Very good," said he, "I am willing to try; and what with
the papers abusing me on one hand, you telling me the truth
on the other, my dear fellow, and with a good dinner, I think I
shall have a most devilishly delightful and piquant time of it."</p>

<p>"Why don't you," said I, "by way of an experiment try the
effects of being honest yourself, and treating other people with
the degree of candor which you pretend to desire?"</p>

<p>"Pretend!" he exclaimed.  "Come, but that is rather blunt,
Pepper, do you say I am only pretending to love truth and
honesty?"</p>

<p>"I think it is nothing more," said I.</p>

<p>"O right, I understand.  Ha! ha! ha!  Come, now, you may

<!-- Volume II, page 103 -->

tell me just what you think, but you will think differently when
you know me better.  What do you think I gave you the check
on my Bank for, if I were not in earnest?  A thousand dollars,
Pepper, is a good deal of money to pay away in a joke."</p>

<p>"Still I don't believe that you are in earnest," I said, "and
when you find out how meanly I think of you, you will quarrel
with me for my honesty."</p>

<p>"Never! never!  Try me and see.  I am determined to know
myself.  I like you better than ever, my dear fellow.  Come to
me to-morrow, and see if I cannot bear all your devilishly sarcastic
and cutting truths."</p>

<p>I knew too well that he would not hold out long, for I saw that
under all his pretended love of truth, that his selfish nature was
only craving for flattery, and that he was unconsciously trying to
bribe me to deceive him with a good opinion of himself, while he
was pretending to purchase my candid opinions of him.  He did
not want his wounds probed but tickled.</p>

<p>I left him with his face flushed, and his blood evidently in a
ferment.  He had gained a sensation, if nothing more, and I had
gained a thousand dollars, which elated my feelings to the highest
point, for with so large a sum of money in my pocket I thought
I might safely venture upon getting married, and I knew that
Pauline, if I could gain access to her, would not refuse to share my
fortunes for the future.</p>

<p>Remembering my promise to Mr. Bassett, not to engage in any
new undertaking without first informing him of it, the next morning
I hurried to him, and finding him in his counting-room, told
him of my engagement with Mr. Slopperton.  He laughed
heartily at my story, but looked grave when I told him that I
fancied I had heard my father's voice the night before, and cautioned
me again not to indulge in such vagaries of fancy.  He
was quite incredulous as to Mr. Slopperton's intentions to pay
me a thousand dollars for telling him what I thought of him, and
when I showed him the check on Mr. Barton's Bank, thought
that the poor man must be out of his mind.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 104 -->

<p>Mr. Bassett advised me not to spend the money until I became
satisfied that Mr. Slopperton was in possession of his ordinary
faculties.  I was somewhat dashed by this very reasonable advice;
for I could not but admit that it would be extremely dishonest
in me to take the poor man's money for such a trifling
service, unless he were perfectly competent to manage his affairs.
He certainly did not lack for shrewdness in managing his
pecuniary affairs, according to his own account; but I determined
to take the advice of Mr. Bassett, and wait for a further
development of Mr. Slopperton's whim before I availed myself
of his liberality; and Mr. Bassett having offered to loan me a
trifle on the check, for I persisted in refusing all assistance from
him in the shape of a gift, I left it with him as security, and
again sallied out into the world in search of an occupation.  As
to accepting the post of truth-teller to such a bundle of vanities
as Mr. Slopperton, even though he paid me handsomely for doing
it, I could not for a moment think of.  It was too much like
the situation of the dummy at an Egyptian feast, to remind the
guests of their mortality.  I had no repugnance to telling Mr.
Slopperton my opinion of him once, or twice, even though he
gave me no recompense for my candor, but to sit at his elbow and
witness his self-delusions only to expose them to him, was a task
I felt quite unwilling to undertake, and I resolved at our next
meeting to tell him what I thought of his weaknesses, and then
leave him; it was not a business of my own seeking.  I felt
impatient for the appointed hour of meeting, that I might be rid
of him.  Having no home, I had made a convenience of the public
room at Sykes', where I had first encountered Mr. Wilton, and
I again sought a refuge there to dissipate the time by poring over
the newspapers until the hour should arrive for calling on Mr.
Slopperton.  This hotel was a common lounging place for all
the odd characters about town, who seemed to be drawn together
by some strong influence, which operated upon me as powerfully
as upon many others in my condition.  Actors out of engagements,
clerks looking for situations, lawyers in want of practice,

<!-- Volume II, page 105 -->

doctors without patients, reporters without employment, bankrupt
merchants, ruined brokers, desperate artists and speculators
of all kinds.  These were the regular frequenters of the hotel,
but as they all had peculiar characteristics, and having no business
of their own to attend to, were well informed in respect to
the business of everybody else, they made up a very agreeable
mixture of society which proved very attractive to the more orderly
and better employed classes, who used to come in there to
smoke a cigar and drink a glass of punch, and learn all the
scandalous news that was floating about town.  I had no aversion
to visiting here when I came as a looker-on, but now that I felt
myself a constituent part of the motley crowd, it gave me an
extremely uneasy feeling; and, instead of being amused with
the oddities around me, I sat gloomily by myself, devising some
means for my future support.  The poor devils who, like myself,
came to Sykes' to beguile their idle time, put on a very
light-hearted air, and drank, and smoked, played at billiards, and
discussed politics, as though the world went lightly with them; but
it was easy enough to pick out among them those who had nearly
reached the lowest point of desperation, and were only debating
in their minds whether it were better to die disgracefully by their
own hands or live dishonorably by the hands of others, and those
who had but entered upon their career of idle dissipation, and
had not yet tasted the bitterness which they were doomed to
swallow.  I felt in no humor to fraternize with any of the unfortunates
around me, but directly a gentleman seated himself at
the little table where I sat, and without speaking to me looked at
me very intently.  He was smoking a cigar, and did not appear
conscious that he ever and anon puffed a cloud of smoke in my
face, although he sat and watched it very closely, and, as I
frowned upon him, looked quite delighted at the indignation
which I must have shown.  He was by no means an impertinent
looking man, and there was a certain expression in his countenance
which pleased me, even while so indignant at his impudence.
He was well dressed, although a little <i>outre</i> in his general

<!-- Volume II, page 106 -->

appearance; his face was very pale, his forehead high and
broad, his eyes grey, and his hair, which was a rich glossy
brown, hung low down his neck in thick curls; he wore his
shirt collar turned over his vest, and only fastened in front
with a small black ribbon.  But, what added more than all to
the singularity of his appearance, he wore his beard naturally,
which at that time was very unusual, except among pirates and
other desperadoes who had the courage to follow the instincts of
their nature and allow their hair to grow as God designed it
should.  For it was then considered either the mark of an abandoned
villain, or of a silly fop, to wear the beard after the manner
of the Grecian sages and God's prophets.</p>

<p>Seeing that the man was puffing his cigar smoke in my face
by design, and not from thoughtlessness, my blood rose at once,
and I said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are an impudent rascal, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" he mildly replied.</p>

<p>This quiet response only excited me the more; but, without
heeding my fierce looks he drew in another mouthful of smoke,
and again blew it about my head.  As if to assure me that he
did it on purpose to insult me, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is very beautiful!"</p>

<p>By this time I had become so fiercely roused that I jumped up
and struck at his face, but he parried the blow and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, I beg your pardon.  Are you angry?"</p>

<p>"Angry!" said I, "do you insult me again, you villain?"</p>

<p>"O, I am very sorry," said he, as mildly as before; "sit down
and let me apologize to you."</p>

<p>I was so entirely overcome by the manner and soothing voice
of this strange person, that quite unconsciously I sat down again
and looked him in the face for an explanation.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said he, looking at me and smiling, "that I like
you very much?"</p>

<p>"It is news to me, I assure you," I replied, "and I should
never have guessed as much from your manner of treating me."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 107 -->

<p>"Wouldn't you?" he said, as pleasantly as before.</p>

<p>"Pray, who are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"O, then, you don't know me?  My name is Ardent," said
he, "the Artist."</p>

<p>"Ardent, <i>the</i> Artist," I repeated; "well, Mr. Ardent, I never
heard of you before, and before I extend my acquaintance with
you, I must have an apology for your rudeness to me."</p>

<p>"Did you think me rude?  O, I am very sorry, very sorry;
I hope I did not hurt your feelings.  I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"Enough," said I, "but be so good as to tell me what could
have caused you to puff your filthy tobacco smoke in my face?"</p>

<p>"O! was it that that annoyed you?" said he, "I am very
sorry about it.  But you must know that you have got exactly
the head on your shoulders that I have been looking for this long
while, and I wanted to see what effect it would have when partially
obscured by a mist, and so I blew the smoke above your
head, and was so charmed with it that I kept repeating it quite
unconsciously.  You will forgive me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Freely," said I, for I could not doubt his sincerity, and my
curiosity was piqued to discover something further about this odd
specimen of humanity.  He was so wholly unlike anybody that
I had yet seen that I felt a sudden attachment to him.</p>

<p>"Come," said Mr. Ardent, "go with me to my painting room
and I will show you the figure that I am painting, for which
I want your head."</p>

<p>I was but too happy to get away from Sykes', and as Mr. Ardent
promised to be on amusing acquaintance, and as I had a great
fondness for pictures, I very gladly accepted his invitation, and
rose to go.</p>

<p>"Have you paid for your drink?" said he.  As I had not I
stepped to the bar, and Mr. Ardent added, "won't you have the
goodness just to pay for a glass of punch and a couple of cigars
that I had?"</p>

<p>Of course I could not refuse so polite a request.</p>

<p>On our way to Mr. Ardent's room he delighted me by the

<!-- Volume II, page 108 -->

originality and boldness of his remarks; his entire freedom
from the conventional hypocrisies and errors of the day; the earnestness
of his manner and the mildness of his voice. It was in
vain that I tried to reply to his remarks, for when I uttered a
word it immediately suggested to him something else, and before
we reached his room, which was in the upper story of a house
far up Broadway, I had listened to a greater amount of philosophical
truth than I had ever heard uttered before.  He seemed
to be inspired upon every subject that he broached, candidly
acknowledging his ignorance on certain points, but speaking
with the confidence of an oracle upon others, particularly in
relation to art.  He quite astounded me by the easy confidence
with which he uttered what I at first thought must be heresies,
because they were contrary to my preconceived notions, but
which I soon received as truths, from the earnest and simple
manner in which they were conveyed to me.  I felt happy in
having at last lighted upon an intelligent candid man, one who
could instruct me by his conversation without disgusting me
with his insincerity or vulgarity, and I speedily forgot that he
had at first offended me so deeply by his seemingly gross misconduct.
When I entered his room I was greatly amused at the
incongruousness of its furniture, and the wild disorder which
seemed to reign supreme there.  It was the first time I had
looked upon an Artist's studio, and was not, therefore, prepared
to see all the strange sights which such receptacles for curiosities
generally present.</p>

<p>There were a great many casts of Venuses and Apollos,
empty champagne bottles, elephant's teeth, a lay figure with a
white satin robe over its shoulders, but with nothing on its legs,
a Roman shield, a gothic chair, a plaster horse, and a marble
dog, all placed together in one corner; the walls were covered
with cartoon drawings of heads, arms and torsos; some of them
were finished with exquisite nicety, and all of them displayed a
masterly hand.  There were landscapes, half finished portraits
and diagrams in abundance, but nothing coarse or vulgar.

<!-- Volume II, page 109 -->

There was a magnificent mahogany chair, covered with crimson
velvet, placed on a kind of throne in front of which stood an unfinished
portrait of a lady, which Mr. Ardent took down and
turned to the wall before I had an opportunity to mark it particularly,
and in spite of all my entreaties he refused to allow me to
look at it.  One corner of the room was screened off by a large
mounted canvas which he turned round, and showed me the
figure of Apollo, which he had spoken of.  I was charmed by
the majestic beauty of the figure, the dignity of expression,
which the Artist had imparted to the features, the depth and
richness of the color, and the purity with which the figure,
although entirely nude, seemed to be invested.</p>

<p>"Come," said he, taking up his maul-stick, brushes and palette;
"take off your hat and try to assume that fierce look
which you put on when you struck at me."</p>

<p>"I cannot assume a look," I replied, "I can only look as I
feel."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I like that much better," said he, "you look
precisely as I wish you to.  Only remain so for a moment."
And he began to touch upon his picture as I stood before him.</p>

<p>"Won't you take off your coat and cravat?" he said.  "Thank
you.  If you could take off your vest conveniently," he said, in
his persuasive manner, "I should like it very much."</p>

<p>I took off my vest as he requested, and, to oblige him still further,
took off my shirt, then my pantaloons, until at last I stood
before him as naked as the figure he was painting; and I was so
charmed by his conversation, and so desirous of obliging him,
that I felt quite unconscious of my rather novel position.  He
continued talking and painting, only interrupting himself occasionally
to request me to vary my position, and I listened to him
without the least diminution of interest in his conversation.  But
we were suddenly interrupted by somebody turning the handle
of the door, and as he had neglected to lock it, I had but barely
time to jump behind the canvas, before the door was opened, and
a lady entered.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 110 -->

<p>"Ah!  How do you do, Mrs. Napkin?" said Mr. Ardent, "are
you pretty well this morning!"</p>

<p>"No.  I am not well, and you know I am not," said the lady.</p>

<p>"Ah!  I am very sorry," said the artist.</p>

<p>"Then pay me my money.  I don't want anybody to be sorry
for me that owes me money," said the lady, seating herself.</p>

<p>"It is very unfortunate for me," said he, deprecatingly, "but
really I have not got a shilling this morning."</p>

<p>"A pretty fellow, you are," said she, "to be up here painting
naked figures, and eating my bread, and my children in want of
shoes to their feet."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! Mrs. Napkin," said he, "it is very unreasonable
in you to talk in that manner.  I have already given you
my watch, that is worth more than five times the amount I owe
you; you have taken the silver palette that was given to me by
the Academy, besides keeping all my wardrobe, and I have paid
you a good deal of money besides, since you turned me out of
your house."</p>

<p>"Well, all I know is, I want my money, and I won't leave
without I get it, or its full value," said the lady.  "Everybody
must take care of themselves in this selfish world."</p>

<p>"But my dear friend," said he &mdash;&mdash;

<p>"O, it's a very easy thing to say my dear friend," said Mrs.
Napkin, "but that's not giving me my money.  I must have my
money.  However, if you won't pay me, I will just pay myself."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't touch those things," exclaimed Mr.
Ardent, and hereupon a scuffle took place between the artist and
his creditor, and before I could discover what they were about I
heard the door slam to, and the artist looking behind the canvas,
exclaimed, in great consternation, "My dear fellow, she has run
off with all your clothes!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p>"IT is very distressing," said the artist, "to be in debt, and
particularly to women, they are so urgent in their demands,
and so unreasonable in their expectations.  I really believe that
I have paid my landlady three or four times the amount of her
bill, and yet she continues to haunt me."</p>

<p>"My good fellow," said I, "if you have paid the woman, of
course you have taken a receipt from her."</p>

<p>"A receipt!" said the artist.  "Well, that is something I
never thought of.  I wish I had, for she is continually threatening
me with a law suit."</p>

<p>"Very well," said I; "if you have been so careless you must
suffer for your negligence; but that is no fault of mine, and I
am not going naked this chilly weather, because you have got a
dishonest landlady."</p>

<p>"Ah!  I am very sorry!" said Mr. Ardent; "but what can I do?"</p>

<p>"What can you do?" I replied.  "It strikes me that the way
is very plain before you; go get a warrant against the harridan
for stealing my clothes, and I will wait here for you to return
with them.  But you must be back soon, for I have an appointment
to keep."</p>

<p>"Ah!  But consider that she is a woman," said the artist.</p>

<p>"A woman!  She is a hag!"  I  exclaimed, growing vexed at
the coolness of the painter. "But do as you choose, either strip
and give me your own clothes, or go and get mine; I have an
appointment to keep, and I cannot break it."</p>

<p>"Have you?" said he; "that is so unfortunate.  But just
stand up for a few minutes, until I finish glazing over the head
with this madder that I have got on my palette."</p>

<p>"No, no, I cannot wait longer," I said.</p>

<p>"You must, or the effect of my picture will be spoiled,"
said he.</p>

<p>"But, I tell you, that I must be gone," said I; "it is impossible.
I cannot."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 112 -->

<p>"Then I swear to you by all that is sacred, if you don't I will
not let you budge from the room to-night." he exclaimed, with a
determined air, and looking me sternly in the face.</p>

<p>I saw there was no use in expostulating, and, as the enthusiast
had me completely in his power, I could do nothing but
yield to his demands; and, placing myself in proper <i>pose</i>, he
commenced rubbing on his confounded madder upon the canvas,
which seemed to afford him as much pleasure as it did me
chagrin.  At last he laid down his palette and brush, and, throwing
his arms around my neck, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are very good, and I am very grateful to you."</p>

<p>"But, said I, "this is getting to be a very serious matter,
my friend; you seem to forget that I am standing here without a
rag of clothes to my back."</p>

<p>"Very true," said he, "you are in a rather awkward box.
But I will go out and try to get your clothes back.  But
suppose that Mrs. Napkin will not deliver them without I pay her
what she claims to be her due?  I have got no money.  Couldn't
you lend me some, and I will pay you very soon?"</p>

<p>"Do you forget," said I, impatiently, "that the woman has
not only carried off my clothes, but everything that was in my
pockets?"</p>

<p>"So she has.  What shall I do?" again said the artist, as he
stood hesitatingly at the door.</p>

<p>"Allow me to suggest to you," said I, "the propriety of bringing
me a suit of your own clothes then, that I may be relieved
from my awkward position."</p>

<p>"It happens very unfortunately," said he, "that I have left
my entire wardrobe in pledge for a small sum that I owe another
landlady, for a trifling board bill.  I declare to you that I don't
know what to do."</p>

<p>There was but one alternative for me, so I wrote a note to
Mr. Bassett, requesting him to give the bearer twenty dollars,
and told the artist after he procured the money to obtain my
clothes and bring them to me; he then left me, locking the door

<!-- Volume II, page 113 -->

and taking the key with him.  He was gone a long time, and I
had to leap about the room to keep me from freezing.  I partly
clothed myself by robbing a lay figure of its mantle of red velvet,
which stood in a corner, and tried to amuse myself by looking
into Mr. Ardent's portfolios, and examining his unfinished
pictures, which were turned to the wall.  I was as much astonished
at the beauty of his paintings, their surprising harmony of
color, and purity of feeling, as I was at his simplicity of character
and elevated mind.  He seemed, in truth, to be a singular
compound of lofty genius, with a mind of more than child-like
simplicity.  His want of tact in the ordinary affairs of life, was
doubtless owing to his mind being so wholly absorbed in his art;
for, as an eagle would starve on a dunghill, where a barn-door
fowl would easily pick up a subsistence, so do such men as Ardent
starve in the world, while meaner persons contrive to live in
ease and splendor.  I could readily pardon the artist for the very
uncomfortable position into which he had unwittingly thrust me,
although my vexation was almost unbearable.  I had sufficient
time to get cool before he returned, and, indeed, when I heard
his step in the passage I was so completely exhausted, for it was
nearly dark, that my teeth chattered with the cold.  He had a
covered basket in his hand, which I supposed, of course, contained
my clothes; and as I demanded them hastily, he said&mdash;

<p>"I have not got your clothes, my good friend, but I have got
you something to eat, and here is a bottle of champagne to warm
you."</p>

<p>Vexed and disappointed as I felt, I was too happy in having something
to eat to reprove him, and immediately fell to upon the cold
tongue, bread and butter, and champagne, which he had brought
me.  We grew very merry together, and I laughed heartily at
his perplexities in trying to get back my clothes.  He had obtained
the money from Mr. Bassett without difficulty, although
he had to wait a couple of hours for him to return to his counting-room
from dinner, and at last had been so vexed at the exorbitant
demands of his landlady, that he swore that he would not

<!-- Volume II, page 114 -->

pay her a dollar, and had to come away without my clothes
after all.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "it was very good of you to think of bringing
me something to eat.  How much money have you got left?"</p>

<p>"The truth is, my dear fellow," said he, embracing me
again, "I have not got any.  But you will not be vexed with
me? I am very sorry it happened so.  But what could I do?
I remembered that I wanted more colors before I could finish
my large picture, and so I stepped into De Bistre's to procure
what I wanted, and when I gave the mercenary wretch the
twenty-dollar bill which I received from your friend, would you
believe that the rascal refused to return me my change, and told
me he would place the balance to my credit."</p>

<p>"Heaven save you!"  I exclaimed, "what shall I do to-night
for my clothes?"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," ejaculated Mr. Ardent again, "but, how
could I help it?  I did not think that De Bistre was such a kind
of man."</p>

<p>"And pray," I asked, "how did you procure the champagne
and cold tongue?"</p>

<p>"O, I left the madder which I bought in pledge for the
amount," said he.</p>

<p>So I was now worse off than before, and as it was now quite
dark, I gave up all hopes of being liberated for the night, and
after Mr. Ardent had lighted a candle, which he stuck into the
neck of the champagne bottle, I wrapped myself up in the old
fragments of cloth which I found in his room, and forgot all my
perplexities while he delivered to me a lecture on the principles
of his art, which was so mingled up with shrewd observations on
men, and profound reflections on the philosophy of life; that I felt
myself not only amply compensated for all the trouble he had
put me to, but indebted to him for his instruction.</p>

<p>How long he would have continued to talk I know not, for his
thoughts seemed to create other thoughts as fast as he uttered
them, and he gave no signs of exhaustion nor I of weariness;

<!-- Volume II, page 115 -->

but the candle having burned down to the end of the wick suddenly
left us in total darkness, and Mr. Ardent exclaimed,
"What a stupid creature I am!  A thought has just occurred
to me. My dear fellow, I will let you put on my clothes, and
go about your business, while I remain here to-night, and if you
please you can come and relieve me in the morning, for I expect
a gentleman here who is to purchase the picture which I
am painting.  I shall then have money enough, for I shall not
sell it for a shilling less than five thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"That is a good round sum," said I, "and I hope you may
get it.  But I fear there are few of our merchants whose enthusiasm
in art will allow them to pay so large a sum for a
picture."</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "I swear they shall never have it, I will
burn it first."</p>

<p>Mr. Ardent then told me that the painters of England
and France, who were much inferior to himself, obtained
much larger prices for their works from the noblemen who
patronized artists, and that he should not undervalue his work
by taking a less sum.  I commended his self-appreciation;
but I reminded him that pictures, like other things, were
only worth what they would bring, and that, as he painted for
money, he must be content with such prices as could be obtained.
I found it was of no use to argue with him on this
point, for he seemed to be impressed with an idea that every
one would be as sensible of the merit of his work as himself;
and having no desire to go out for the night only, I declined the
offer of his clothes, and requested him to lock me in, and return
to me in the morning with some breakfast, when I would devise
some measures for extricating both of us from our difficulties.
I intended to make use of the check which Mr. Slopperton
had given me, not only to procure a new suit of clothes
for myself, but also to loan the generous, but thoughtless man
of genius sufficient money to enable him to complete his picture,
which I did not doubt he could sell for a very large sum,

<!-- Volume II, page 116 -->

although he might not get the amount which he demanded
for it.</p>

<p>I found that Mr. Ardent was one of those sincere men who
believe that men mean what they say; so taking me at my
word, he embraced me again, and bidding me good night, locked
the door, and left me to my repose.</p>

<p>He came the next morning, but not before I had been on my
feet a couple of hours, and brought with him another covered
basket with a comfortable breakfast.  I was very impatient to
get away, but as he requested me to stand for him while he gave
another touch to his picture, that it might be in a good condition
for his expected purchaser to look at, I could not refuse him so
reasonable a request.  I must confess, too, that I felt not a little
flattered at the thought of standing for a portrait of Apollo, and
as the artist had given the god a strong likeness to my features,
I was not altogether displeased at the compliment, as I
knew it to be sincere.  While he was working at the picture and
I stood naked before him, there was a knock at the door, and I had
but barely time to leap behind the easel, against which the canvas
rested, before his expected visitor entered bringing with him two
persons whose presence gave me anything but a pleasant feeling.</p>

<p>"I say, Barton," exclaimed one of them, as they entered the
studio, "what a devilishly piquant place this is to introduce a
young lady.  Don't you think so, Miss Pauline?"</p>

<p>"It is very well," replied a soft, sweet voice that made my
heart tremble.  "I see nothing very piquant."</p>

<p>"These are my friends, sir," said Mr. Barton, to the artist.
"who have come to look at your picture and give me their opinion
of it.  Faith, it is rather piquant, I must confess, Slopperton.
But it's a glorious thing, though, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Glorious!  What a figure!" said Mr. Slopperton.  "But how
devilishly surprisingly Apollo looks like your friend Tom
Pepper, ha, Barton.  What do you think, Miss Pauline!"</p>

<p>"Oh! it's a noble figure," said she, "and the face is truly
the face of a god.  You will buy it, will you not?"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 117 -->

<p>"I am not sure that I will," said Mr. Barton, "it was an
Apollo that I wanted and not a Mercury.  It looks like that rascal,
Tom Pepper, indeed.  I don't like the sinister looks of the
scamp."</p>

<p>"It is as honest a face as your own," said the artist,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Devilishly piquant, that, Barton," said Mr. Slopperton.  "It's
not exactly the kind of talk for an artist to have to his
employer; decidedly not, I should say."</p>

<p>"You are unjust to the figure, I am sure," said Pauline,
sweetly; "the face strikes me as noble and full of truth and
beauty."</p>

<p>"Full of roguery!  It's a rascally face," exclaimed Mr.
Barton.</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that, my good fellow, not quite so bad," said
Mr. Slopperton; "but I must say, Mr. What's-your-name, that
you have hit upon a most remarkable cast of features for your
Apollo; it is devilishly piquant and knowing, but it resembles
one of the greatest liars in existence.  Tut, tut, you never heard
of such a reprobate; the devil may be the father of lies, but the
rascal that your Apollo resembles is the son of lies.  Pretty fair
that, ha!  Barton?  Devilishly piquant and all that sort of
thing, but true, though, Miss Pauline."</p>

<p>Pauline made no reply, but I fancied that I felt her indignant
looks through the pores of the canvas; and I could hardly restrain
myself from stepping from behind the picture and embracing
her.  It was not very pleasant to stand still and hear
myself abused by Mr. Slopperton, whose change of opinion respecting
my truthfulness angered me as much as it puzzled me.
Nothing but my perfectly nude condition could have restrained
me from jumping from behind the painting and demanding an
explanation of his abuse.  But I was doomed to a much greater
mortification than any I had yet experienced, as the reader will
shortly learn.</p>

<p>"The painting is pretty well," said Mr. Barton; "there is a

<!-- Volume II, page 118 -->

sort of a Titianesque tone that is agreeable to the eye, but the
subject is not a good one, and I think that the trees have too
natural a look; I don't like this actuality in a picture; what I
wish, Mr. Ardent, is a little more of the elevation of the old masters,
the sort of ideality that you see in the works of Mopson, a
very clever young fellow whom I sent to Rome, and who has
made some excellent copies of the Byzantine school.  You know
what I mean?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know, nor do I care," said the artist.</p>

<p>"O, I know, and I hate the whole of them most heartily," said
Pauline; "they are those insipid-looking dolls, with gilt rainbows
round their heads. They are detestable.  I declare, now, I love
this Apollo, and I would not exchange it for a room-full of those
horrid creatures which your Mr. Mopson painted.  Works, indeed!
He may be a workman, but he is not an artist."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Ardent, "your opinion is worth
something to me."</p>

<p>"O, fie!  Miss Pauline," said Mr. Slopperton; "you have not
been in Europe, and have not had the advantage of studying the
old masters.  Now let me point out here the defects in this composition;
just look at the arm, for instance; did you ever see
such foreshortening in any of the old masters?"</p>

<p>"You shall point out no defects in my pictures," exclaimed
Mr. Ardent; "neither shall you have it at all, I will burn it first."</p>

<p>And suddenly seizing the canvas, he lifted it from the easel,
and before I could call out to him to stop I found myself standing
face to face before the artist's visitors.  Mr. Ardent at once discovered
his blunder, but he was so much astonished, that, instead
of putting back the picture and screening me from their gaze, he
only exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what have I done!"</p>

<p>There was no retreat for me, so I could do nothing but stand
still; Pauline made a hasty exit, followed by Mr. Barton, muttering
something which I could not hear; and Mr. Slopperton
remained long enough to say&mdash;</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 119 -->

<p>"That's a devilish piquant exhibition, Mr. What's-your-name.
It will do, now and then, by way of a surprise to your visitors,
but I would advise you not to repeat it too often.  So, Mr. Pepper,
this is one of your devilishly piquant freaks.  It's pretty
fair though, upon my word.  Good morning to you."  And so
saying, Mr. Slopperton look his leave.</p>

<p>Ludicrous as my situation was, I felt too much chagrined to
laugh, and Mr. Ardent seeing my confusion showed no disposition
to be merry.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, "my friend, you do not know what harm you
may have done me."</p>

<p>"I am very, very sorry," he replied; "but I could not help
it.  I was so exasperated to hear that ignorant fool talk about
something which he did not understand that I forgot you were
standing behind the picture.  Forgive me.  What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"Get me my clothes," I replied, "that I may go and look for
employment.  I fear that you have ruined me."</p>

<p>"If I have," said he, "I shall love you better for it, and I
will paint such a portrait of you as the world has never
seen."</p>

<p>"But in the meantime I am suffering for the want of my
clothes.  You seem to forget that I am naked," said I.</p>

<p>"O! true.  What shall I do!  Heavens, was there ever such
an unhappy wretch?  But stop.  I have an idea.  What a dunce
I was not to think of it before.  Be patient but a moment or two
and I will be back to you."</p>

<p>So saying, the artist put on his hat, and covering up his picture
of Apollo with some old newspapers, he took it on his back
and went out, locking the door after him.  From his absent-mindedness,
I was afraid that it would be a long while before
he returned; but he disappointed me most agreeably by returning
in a very short time, bringing my clothes with him in a bundle.
I was too happy to be relieved from my awkward confinement
to remain long after I had dressed myself; so, promising

<!-- Volume II, page 120 -->

to return to the artist's studio the next day, as he begged me to
do, I bade him good-bye, and made haste to Mr. Bassett's office
for the purpose of obtaining Mr. Slopperton's check that I might
cash it at the bank.  Mr. Bassett did not appear to be very
well pleased to hear of my intimacy with Mr. Ardent, although
he laughed very heartily when I related to him the manner in
which I had been exposed to Miss Pauline and Mr. Barton.  He
cautioned me against frequenting the artist's studio, and said I
should be in danger of falling into loose habits, if I did not get
into a habit of loose thinking, by forming such intimacies.</p>

<p>By looseness, Mr. Bassett explained that he meant liberal,
and by liberal he again explained that be meant unrestrained,
and so he went on explaining what he meant until at last he
grew embarrassed, and I said to him:</p>

<p>"What you mean, I find, is, that I should not think at all."</p>

<p>"Not exactly so," he replied.  "A man who never thinks is
a mere machine."</p>

<p>"And a man who does not think freely," I replied, "had
better not think at all."</p>

<p>"There is some truth in what you say," he remarked; "but
it is dangerous, my dear boy, to be a free-thinker.  If there is
no other danger in it, it is dangerous to the reputation of a
business man; and as I hope to see you one yet, in spite of all
your odd adventures, I must caution you against frequenting the
society of such men as Mr. Ardent; for artists have a prescriptive
privilege to be eccentric, and they may indulge in a great
many absurdities, and even vices, which might be ruinous to a
man of business."</p>

<p>I was here compelled to remind Mr. Bassett that he was now
teaching me to be a hypocrite after having imbued me with a love
of truth and sincerity; and that I was afraid he had lost his love
of that transparency of conduct which he had taught me to cultivate
in myself, or that he had lost his faith in his ideal abstraction
of truthfulness.  He blushed and smiled, but replied with a
little embarrassment in his manner:</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 121 -->

<p>"You are right, Tom, and I acknowledge the justice of your
reproof; I have particular motives which I cannot explain to you
now, for requesting you not to visit Mr. Ardent again, and yet I
would prefer that you should choose a different kind of person
for your intimate friend; for you see that however well meaning
and generous Mr. Ardent may be, he is continually liable to
lead you into embarrassments by his thoughtlessness."</p>

<p>I could not but acknowledge the justice of Mr. Bassett's remarks,
and promised him that after I had called to see Mr. Ardent
once again, that I would then avoid him, and endeavor to
establish my character for steadiness and sobriety, and live down
all the evil reports which had been circulated respecting me.  It
was now too late to get the check cashed, but I took it from Mr.
Bassett, and going to Mr. Slopperton's Hotel found that gentleman
in his room, dressed in a Turkish costume, reclining on his sofa
and refreshing himself with a bowl of soup.  He jumped up at
sight of me, and at first was going to look heroic, but he appeared
to change his mind, and laughing in his half-earnest, vapid manner,
said:</p>

<p>"Well, here you are again, my fine fellow, not according to
promise, exactly, but as near as I expected, from you, you know,
Mr. Pepper."</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "you are changed in your manner towards me."</p>

<p>"Changed! well, that is devilishly piquant, to be sure.  However,
Mr. Pepper, let me do you the justice to say that the last
time I saw you, you threw off all disguise.  There was no concealment
then.  Faith, but it was a truthful and perfectly plain
exhibition of yourself, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"O!  I understood it all. It was part of your plan to be perfectly
candid and to conceal nothing.  Ha! ha!  Devilish piquant
and ingenious.  But it was shameful in you and the artist
to do such a thing when a lady was in the case."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insinuate that it was a concocted scheme
between myself and Mr. Ardent?" said I.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 122 -->

<p>"Very good! very good, indeed!  Most capital joke!  Piquant,
but rather gross.  By the way, it will ruin the artist, though.
Your friend will pay dear for his humor, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Come, sir," said I "this is getting to be too serious a thing
to banter about.  I will not permit it."</p>

<p>"O, you won't? O, very well, if it is unpleasant to you, let
us say no more about it.  But it was a rather piquant affair, and
it will read devilishly well in print.  But, by the way, Mr.
Pepper, you have not cashed the check I gave you?"</p>

<p>I told him that I had not, but that I should in the morning as I
needed the money.</p>

<p>"Aha!  That is lucky," said he; "the fact is, I want to make
a small alteration in the check, just to add a trifle to it; I was
not liberal enough to you for your very, very sincere remarks to
me.  Antoine, bring my desk.  The check now, if you please,
for one moment, Mr. Pepper."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said I, reaching it to him.</p>

<p>"That's it, that's it," he exclaimed, clutching it, and tearing
it into bits.  "That's it, Mr. Pepper, my good fellow, you will
not have the pleasure of spending any of my money.  Ha! ha!
devilishly well done, Antoine, ha!  Rather piquant, upon the
whole."

<p>"You wanted my candid opinion of you," said I, "and I
promised that you should have it."</p>

<p>"O! of course; you gave it to me; very reliable it was too,"
said he.</p>

<p>"I saw that you were a poor, vain creature, and I intended you
should know it, and the large bribe you offered me only made me
the more determined to be perfectly sincere with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Mr. Pepper, I know all about your sincerity," said
he, "I saw how capable you were of exposing yourself."</p>

<p>"I will permit no light allusions to that accident," said I.
"You are not worthy of my anger, Mr. Slopperton, but I will
not allow you to trifle with my feelings nor with the character
of my friend; so have a guard upon your tongue.  You thought

<!-- Volume II, page 123 -->

to bribe me to flatter you, and under the pretense of purchasing
my candid opinion, hoped to induce me to flatter you.  If you
had not been a knave you would not have tried to make a knave
of me, and if you had really wanted to know yourself you would
have been content with your self-investigation.  You are not
only weak in your head, but you are bad in your heart.
You begin with deceiving yourself, and end with deceiving
others.  You lied to me but just now in trying to obtain your
check from me."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Antoine!" said he.  "The rascal tells
me that I lie!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I?" said I. "Did you not wish me to tell
you the truth?"</p>

<p>Mr. Slopperton turned very pale, and trembled as he walked
across the floor.  He approached me and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Pepper, this is just what I expected.  I knew you
would abuse me.  I have heard all about you.  I will tell you
how it was, my fine fellow.  My friend Barton is a bit of a wag,
and a devilish piquant fellow, too; I was telling him how I
wished I could find one honest, truthtelling and sincere individual&mdash;and
he, thinking that I knew what a notorious romancer you
were, Pepper, said, by way of a joke, 'there's Tom Pepper, now,
he is just the man for you, send for him, and he will tell you the
truth; he is proverbial for it.'  That's the way it occurred, my
good fellow, you see I was rather green.  It's no fault of mine.
'Twas a devilish good joke of Barton's, though, and he and
Pauline, the young lady he is going to marry, had a good
hearty laugh at my expense, when I told them what a dunce
I had been."</p>

<p>"The young lady he is going to marry!" I exclaimed, with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"The young lady he is going to marry, of course, or the
young lady who is going to marry him; just as you please,
Pepper, it makes no odds to me, not the least in the world  I assure
you."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 124 -->

<p>"Is it possible!" I exclaimed, "that Pauline is going to marry
Mr. Barton!"</p>

<p>"Possible!  It is not only possible, but it is devilishly probable;
in fact, it is positively the case, Pepper," said Mr. Slopperton;
"no romance about it."</p>

<p>"No, no, there can be no romance about a marriage like
that," I said, "but it must not be."</p>

<p>"Well, that is good.  It would be a devilish piquant joke if
old Barton should let his pretty pullet escape from his fingers
after all.  Have you any objection to the marriage, Mr.
Pepper?"</p>

<p>"You shall know in good time," said I, "what objection I
have."</p>

<p>And I turned to go out of the room, for I felt too hearty a
contempt for Mr. Slopperton to stand and talk with him any
longer, and my temper had not been rendered particularly
placid by the revelation in respect to the marriage of Pauline.
As I was going out of the door, Mr. Slopperton called me
back.</p>

<p>"Stop one moment, Pepper," said he, drawing out his purse
from the pocket of his dressing gown, and offering me a bank
bill, "here's something to pay you for your trouble; it is not
quite a thousand dollars, but it will discharge my obligations to
you, my fine fellow."</p>

<p>Rejecting his proffered pay with an expression of contempt, I
turned and left him, and once more found myself on the side-walk
penniless and without an occupation.  I was loth to ask assistance
again of Mr. Bassett, and cursed my unlucky fate which
doomed me to such constant changes and reverses.  I reproached
my father, in my thoughts, for not binding me an apprentice
to some honorable trade, and could not help thinking that Mr.
Bassett had rendered me but a cruel kindness in learning me to
hate hypocrisy and deceit, while he turned me adrift among
knaves and hypocrites to earn my living.  If he had placed me
in a position independent of the rogueries of the world, he might

<!-- Volume II, page 125 -->

well have instructed me to be honest; but how was I to live
among knaves and not be a knave myself.  For a moment my
determination wavered, as I looked around me and saw the evidences
of prosperous cheating; there were quack doctors riding
in their carriages, turn-coat patriots enjoying profitable offices,
pettifogging attorneys living in splendid houses, and all manner of
tradesmen respected for their fortunes which had been accumulated
by deceiving their customers.  But my irresolution lasted
but a moment, just long enough to allow me to feel that I was in
danger of backsliding, and to make me resolve afresh to preserve
my integrity, and do honor to Captain St. Hugh, let the consequences
be what they might.  I had learned to hate hypocrisy
and deceit, and I could never again be a knave.  Let those
who have become sick of the hollow-heartedness and hypocrisy
of mankind, but make the experiment of acting honestly and
truthfully themselves, keeping a watch upon their actions and
words continually, and they will soon learn to be more tolerant
of the knaveries of mankind.  I have generally found that
those who make the loudest complaints about the deceits of the
world, are those whose own deceptions have brought them into
contempt.  It was not a very hard struggle for me to be honest,
I had resolved to be so consistently upon principle, for I had
no one dependent upon me whose welfare I felt fearful of sacrificing;
I had only myself to look out for, and as I cared for
nothing but to merit the good opinion of my supposed father,
Captain St. Hugh, it mattered but little to me what disasters I
fell into, if I could but keep my honor untarnished from the imputation
of a lie.  It was true that my past conduct had gained
me a reputation for lying which had made my name a bye-word
but I had such a profound belief in the omnipotence of Truth,
that I knew I should be justified in the end.  So it gave me no
uneasiness, beyond a momentary feeling of anger, to hear myself
spoken of in the manner in which Mr. Slopperton and Mr.
Barton had alluded to me.  I knew myself to be sincere and
honest, and the inward consciousness of truth sustained me

<!-- Volume II, page 126 -->

against all the outward marks of contempt which were shown
me.  Besides, I continued to entertain the expectation something
would yet happen to place me in possession of the property
of my supposed ancestors, and perhaps some of my high toned
feelings had their origin in the belief that I was the descendant of
the chivalric old Sir Eustace, and was therefore bound to
conduct myself in a manner worthy of that fine old English
gentleman.</p>

<p>As to my grandfather Pepper, who certainly had rather
stronger claims upon me than the St. Hughs&mdash;for it was to his
early care and affection that I was more indebted for my healthy
constitution than to any other human being&mdash;I must confess that
I did not often think of him.  The truth is, I had nothing to
hope for from him, and Blackmere Castle more frequently introduced
itself into my imagination than the roofless old homestead
in which I first saw the light at Apponagansett.  Tenderly
as I cherished the image of my poor mother, for I could never
think of her without my eyes filling with tears, I endeavored
to divert my thoughts from dwelling upon her.  Time had in no
degree diminished or rendered indistinct the recollection of her
sweet sad face, and to think of her was to call up a palpable
and distinct picture of her form as I last saw it, when it lay cold
and stiff, and wrapped in the white robe they put upon her when
she had ceased to press me to her beating heart.  It was only at
moments when I was secure from observation that I ever allowed
myself to dwell for a moment on this melancholy subject;
but now as I walked down Broadway, after I had left Mr. Slopperton's
Hotel, I unconsciously fell into a musing humor, and
spite of myself and the noise and bustle around me, I could
not help dwelling on the early years of my existence, and every
event of my boyhood passed through my mind with a strange distinctness,
and so impressed me with their vividness that I quite
forgot where I was.  Again I thought I could hear the sweetly
plaintive tones of my mother's voice as she used to bend over
me and call me her poor fatherless boy.  Tears gushed into my

<!-- Volume II, page 127 -->

eyes, and I was blind to every thing about me; but I was soon
roused from my dreams and made to feel the painfulness of my
actual condition by hearing a voice ejaculate&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor Walter!"</p>

<p>Rubbing my eyes with my pocket-handkerchief, and looking
around me for the speaker whose voice I had heard, and which
I knew to be Pauline's, I could no where see her. A crowd of
ladies were moving along, but I could not recognize among them
the form of Pauline. The whole vision of my youthful days was
suddenly dissipated, and I was again wide awake to myself; I
was no longer an unhappy boy in Apponagansett, but an unhappy
man in Broadway without home or employment.  But I
did not long remember even this, for while I stood looking
around me for Pauline, I saw the carriage of Mr. Barton standing
in front of a jeweler's, and looking into the store I beheld that
gentleman, dressed as usual with exceeding neatness and in the
extreme of the fashion, examining some articles of jewelry.
Pauline stood beside him, and my blood grew hot and my head
began to swim, as I saw him take her hand and hold it in his
own, while the jeweler fastened upon her wrist a sparkling
bracelet.</p>

<p>Pauline's eyes were not regarding the jewel upon her wrist,
nor was she heeding the comments of the jeweler, nor listening
to the remarks of the Banker who seemed to be saying something
complimentary to her while he looked at the trinket with
his eye glass; but her eyes were turned upon me, her gentle
blue eyes that always seemed to beam with love and pity when
they looked upon me.  Mr. Barton was so occupied by the trinkets
which were displayed before him, that he did not discover
that I stood before the open door, and that Pauline was earnestly
regarding me.  I guessed at once the object of their visit to the
jeweler, which was to select her bridal ornaments.  Pauline's
elder sister, Lizzy was deeply engaged in discussing with another
of the assistants in the store the merits of a silver tea-set; her
back was turned towards me but I instantly recognized her by her

<!-- Volume II, page 128 -->

tall form, and her dark hair which she wore in ringlets down her
neck.  They were all in high glee, and seemed entirely absorbed
in the contemplation of the splendid finery which they were examining,
but Pauline, who still kept looking towards me, and gave
me a glance of her dear eyes which filled me with rapturous feelings.
I was on the point of rushing into the store and clasping
her in my arms, which would certainly have been a most ridiculous
proceeding, but she seemed to divine my thoughts and
shook her head to check me.  But I was fast losing all command
of myself, and know not what extravagancies I should have committed,
had not Lizzy suddenly taken Mr. Barton by the arm and
dragged him to the other end of the store where she was examining
the silver tea-set.  Pauline remained behind, still pretending
to be engaged in examining the bracelets, but with her eyes upon
me.  She looked round upon Mr. Barton and her sister at the
opposite end of the store, and taking the bracelet from her wrist
returned it to the jeweler.</p>

<p>Was she going to turn her back upon me, and join my old
enemy!</p>

<p>She paused a moment and turned towards me again.  Her face
was flushed, and she seemed to tremble; I was in a delirium of
passion for a moment, but a moment only, for suddenly she
moved towards the door, and looking back upon her sister and
Mr. Barton, who were still apparently absorbed in the admiration
of the tea-set, she ran hastily to me and said in a low hurried
voice,</p>

<p>"Go, Walter, go.  You distress me by looking in upon me,
here.  You must forget me hereafter.  I shall never forget you,
but you must forget me. Good bye, dear Walter; it will only
distress us both by your remaining here."</p>

<p>But I could not go, and I made no attempt to move; on the
contrary I took her hand, which she withdrew and looking back
to her sister and Mr. Barton, said again,</p>

<p>"Go, Walter.  They have not seen you and I shall be unhappy
if they do.  Go, go, dear, go."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 129 -->

<p>But every time she said go, I but felt more inclined to stay,
and utterly regardless of her entreaties I again caught her hand
and held it so tightly that she did not withdraw it.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said I, "did you not love me once?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, blushing and casting down her eyes, "I did,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, Pauline," I said; "you hesitate; do you hesitate
to say you love me no longer?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to say that, Walter, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you do not love me.  I see."  I replied, letting go her
hand.</p>

<p>"You must go, Walter, if you love me," she said, looking
back again.</p>

<p>"I do love you," I said, "and therefore I will not go,
Pauline, unless you go with me."</p>

<p>And taking her hand again I drew her from the shop door.</p>

<p>"O, Walter!" she exclaimed, "what are you doing? You
are mad.  You will cause me a good deal of unhappiness.  Go
leave me."</p>

<p>"I will never cause my dear Pauline a moment's unhappiness,"
I replied, and holding her hand firmly in my own, I placed
it under my arm, and drew her after me.  She did not
hold back, but leaned heavily upon me; we glided along the
side-walk rapidly, and I was in so excited a condition that I
hardly knew whither I went, nor whether we ran, walked, or
flew.  It was one of those tumultuously happy moments of my
life that never fails to set my blood in a glow whenever I think
of it.  I was in an ecstasy of delight, and my blood tingled
with the sensations of triumph as we hurried along.  I kept
looking behind me, but saw no one in pursuit, and at the first
corner we turned out of Broadway into a less frequented street.</p>

<p>"Is any one coming?" asked Pauline.</p>

<p>"I see no one that you need fear," said I, "darling Pauline."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p>PAULINE clung close to my side as we hurried on in silence
until we had reached a by-street, for we were both too much excited
to speak. For my own part, I never before in my life
had experienced such a tingling sensation of happiness as I then
felt.  It would, at any time, have been sufficiently delightful to
me to feel the pressure of Pauline's arm upon my own, but to
know that I had succeeded in entrapping her from the fold of my
arch enemy, Mr. Barton, gave me the most exquisite pleasure.
So sudden and unexpected had been our movements that I had
not for one moment reflected on what would be the probable result
of stealing her away, and was silent, until she looked up in
my face, with her bewitching smile, and said:</p>

<p>"Dear Walter, where are we going?"</p>

<p>"I know not," I replied, "but we will not stop until we
get to a secure retreat.  But do not call me Walter again, love,
for you know it is not my name."</p>

<p>"Is is the only name by which I know you, and I love to call
you Walter," she replied.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, "let it be so now.  But, tell me,
Pauline, were you going to desert me?"</p>

<p>"Ask me no more questions," said she, "about that; have I
not followed you now? and can you think that I would have deserted
you ever, when I follow you now at such risks to myself?
No, Walter, I would never have deserted you.  When you know all
you will not censure me, and, I hope, not love me less, than
you did."</p>

<p>I only pressed her dear little hand in reply, for I was too much
delighted by her frankness and generosity to make any other
answer.  I was sure of her now; and on we walked, very
rapidly, casting uneasy glances about us, and turning down
into the most unfrequented streets, and dreading all the time lest
we should encounter a familiar face.  But happily we saw no

<!-- Volume II, page 131 -->

one who recognized us, and at last, when nearly out of breath,
we slackened our pace, hesitated, and stood still.  I looked
Pauline full in the face, for I had hardly glanced at her before.
She at first laughed hysterically, and then burst into
tears, and then laughed again. She leaned upon my shoulder,
and as I felt her little heart beat violently, I began to fear that
she would lose control of her feelings, and that an embarrassing
scene might be the consequence in the street.</p>

<p>"Come, Pauline," said I, "let us not stop here; a happy
thought strikes me.  I know of a home where you will be
happy and safe until I can procure a better one for you.  I have
no money, Pauline, but I can obtain some, and you will have
no cause to repent of the step you have taken."</p>

<p>"Repent!" she exclaimed, proudly; "why should I repent?
Let us go on.  I glory in what I have done; it has saved me
from the necessity of repentance hereafter.  You have saved
me, dear Walter, from a horrid fate, and you shall never again
have cause to suspect me of repentance.  No, Walter, I have
not acted rashly; it was only sudden, not rash.  I know what I
have done, and am prepared for the consequences.  You may
take me whither you will and I will follow you."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that as my old friends, the Goodwills, kept a
kind of Asylum for all kinds of runaways in distress, that they
would willingly receive such a darling fugitive as Pauline, for I
had known them to be at great expense and trouble in enabling
negro slaves to escape from their owners.  Pauline's sweet face,
thought I, will surely make as deep an impression upon the kind
hearted Quakers as though it were a jet black, and her golden
locks will not be less pleasant to their sight than the crisp wool
of the African wenches they have so often given a shelter to.&mdash;But,
even though they should refuse to give Pauline a home,
until I could procure one for her, I could not doubt that Sophia
Ruby, who was such an ardent worshipper of the beautiful, would
be too happy to have in her house such a glorious creature as
Pauline, who was certainly infinitely more beautiful than any

<!-- Volume II, page 132 -->

of the Dresden China ornaments or French engravings in her
cabinets.  The love of the beautiful that is satisfied with the
imitations of Art is but a sham passion, and I had no doubt of the
sincerity of Mrs. Ruby's love for the beautiful, for she made it
the prominent topic of her conversation.</p>

<p>As my sole object now was to find a secure retreat for Pauline,
until I could make some permanent provision for her, it was no
time to be particular, and I resolved to take her first to friend
Goodwill's, and if we were rejected there to then appeal to the
tender sympathies of Sophia Ruby.  I only told Pauline that I
was taking her to the house of a friend where she would be
kindly received, and that she might feel herself entirely secure,
leaving until some other time a full explanation to her of my peculiar
position towards my Quaker friends.  Pauline was nothing
loth to follow me, and having once more become composed
and rational, we threaded our way through all the by-streets and
lanes until we reached East Broadway, where the Goodwills
dwelt.  This was happily very far from the house of Pauline's
father, and she felt less fear of being pursued, than she did at
first.  Luckily we found the wife of friend Goodwill at home,
and without knowing the cause of my visit she welcomed me
heartily and showed as much kindness of feeling for poor Pauline
as though she had been a daughter.  But Pauline was terribly
embarrassed, and when I told Mrs. Goodwill the nature of our
relation to each other, and the object we had in view, the dear girl
nearly fainted.  The kindly manner in which the excellent old
lady received her, however, soon reassured her, so that she took
off her hat and looked more bright and beautiful than I had ever
seen her before, and I could not help feeling very proud for the
Goodwills to know that such a lovely creature had deserted her
home and friends for my sake.</p>

<p>"Thee is welcome to remain here, friends, as long as thee
pleases," said the benevolent old lady, "but we cannot allow
thee to occupy one room."</p>

<p>Poor Pauline blushed very red, and I felt not a little confused

<!-- Volume II, page 133 -->

at Mrs. Goodwill's blunt remark, which was not intended as a
reproof, but was only the result of her cultivating plainness of
speech as a religious duty.</p>

<p>I inquired after Desire, but that young lady had gone out on
some errand of benevolence in company with Mrs. Ruby, and
was not expected back until night.  The good old lady retired
for a few minutes to prepare some refreshment for us, when I
arranged with Pauline that she should remain under the friendly
roof of the Goodwills, while I called upon Mr. Bassett to tell
him what I had done, and procure some money, for we also resolved
to be married at once to prevent the possibility of our
separation by any accident that might lead to the discovery of
Pauline's retreat.</p>

<p>So, after attempting to partake of Mrs. Goodwill's cakes and
sweetmeats, for which neither Pauline nor I had the least appetite,
I took a tender farewell of her, and begged Mrs. Goodwill
not to allow anybody to see the darling girl that I entrusted to
her keeping until I returned, and the old lady promised to comply
with my request as far as it was consistent with principle.</p>

<p>I had been in such a delirium of excitement ever since I left
the jeweler's shop with Pauline, that I had not stopped to think
of the propriety of the act of which I had been guilty, nor of its
ultimate results.  But on my way to Mr. Bassett's office I had
more time for reflection, and I began to think that my conduct
would not appear to him in quite so favorable a light as it did to
myself.  It was clear that Pauline loved me, and that was sufficient
excuse for running away with her; it as clear, too, that
she did not love Mr. Barton, and that was sufficient reason for preventing
the match between them; it was quite clear, too, that in
my present circumstances I had no right to entice Pauline from
her happy home, for I had no home to take her to in the place of
her own.  But still I could not persuade myself to relinquish
the prize which I had obtained, and I trusted to receive sympathy
and money too, from Mr. Bassett; but in these expectations I

<!-- Volume II, page 134 -->

was disappointed, for on telling him the particulars of the abduction
of Pauline, he not only did not approve of my conduct but
lectured me severely for it.</p>

<p>I felt too proud to attempt to justify myself, and told him that I
had called to tell him what I had done in accordance with my
promise, and that what I wanted of him was assistance, and not
advice, and that if he would not give me that which I most needed
I would prefer not to receive the other.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," said he, "I see that you are really in earnest,
and therefore you do need my advice for the reason that you do
not feel the want of it.  There is no act of a man's life, my dear
boy, in which he so much requires the advice of his friends, or
so little feels the necessity for it, as in his marriage.  You are
blinded with passion, your blood is inflamed, your head is turned,
and you are wholly insensible of the dangers that surround you;
I, on the contrary, am cool and unprejudiced, have no feelings
to influence me, except a desire to see you happy, and am therefore
more likely to judge correctly in this affair than you can be;
and now let me tell you, Tom, that if you were not very much
blinded indeed by your passions, that your natural keenness of
insight into character would enable you to see that Pauline has
no real love for you, or at least not the kind of love which is
likely to endure and render a man happy."</p>

<p>I was too indignant at the imputation upon Pauline's sincerity
to reply to him, and turned to go out of the counting-room, when
he put his hand upon my shoulder and told me to stop.</p>

<p>"Why should I stop here longer," I exclaimed in a passion,
"to hear you abuse the purest minded and most beautiful creature
in the world?  No, I will not allow any person to whisper
a word against the unsullied purity of Pauline's character."</p>

<p>"I have said nothing against her character," replied Mr. Bassett,
smiling; "I merely said that her love for you was not of
that kind which is calculated to make a man permanently happy.
Consider, Tom, that after having once promised never to desert
you, that she was on the point of being married to a man that

<!-- Volume II, page 135 -->

she entertained no love for whatever.  Does that sound like the
act of a woman capable of enduring affection?"</p>

<p>I was startled at this new aspect of the character of Pauline,
and replied that, although circumstances might appear against
her, yet I was confident of the purity of her mind and the devotedness
of her love for me, and that a very satisfactory explanation
could be made of her conduct.</p>

<p>"Ah! that may be," replied Mr. Bassett, "but until the explanation
shall be made, my dear boy, be careful how you entangle
yourself for life.  An hour or two of prudent reflection
now, may save you from years of wretchedness hereafter.
Pauline is a very sweet girl, and I can readily understand the
ardor of your feelings towards her; but truly, Tom, I should
regard with suspicion a young lady who could so readily desert
her natural ties for my sake.  Instead of regarding it as a proof
of the strength of her love, I should only look upon it as an evidence
of the weakness of her principles; for love, Tom, is not a
passion, but a principle, and a dutiful and affectionate daughter
you may be sure will prove a loving and dutiful wife.  You,
who so love truth and honesty, or at least profess to do so, could
never long retain your love for your wife if you found her lacking
in those qualities."</p>

<p>"Of course I could not," said I; "but who will say that
Pauline has ever been insincere?"</p>

<p>"As for that," replied Mr. Bassett, "I would not accuse her
of duplicity; but it is very clear that she was acting insincerely
towards Mr. Barton when she consented to marry him, while her
heart was wholly devoted to another, for, of course, Mr. Barton
would never have thought of marrying a young lady who frankly
told him that she did not love him; and if she did not tell him of
the true state of her feelings she was guilty of a very great
wrong towards him, one that she could never have atoned for."</p>

<p>I was forced to admit that there was some appearance of reason
in what he said, but such was my confidence in the integrity
of Pauline's nature and the innocence of her heart, that I was

<!-- Volume II, page 136 -->

willing to stake my chance for happiness upon my union with her,
and I assured Mr. Bassett that sooner than wound the feelings of
Pauline by demanding an explanation of her conduct that I would
submit to a life of misery.  It was enough for me to know that
she had placed her honor and happiness in my keeping, and I
would not, like a selfish villain, wound her tender sensibilities,
for the sake of satisfying my own scruples.</p>

<p>"I shall deem it but a small matter," said I, "to sacrifice myself,
if it be necessary, for the sake of so pure, so sweet and so
lovely a creature."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Bassett, "let the consequences be upon
your own head, but remember, rash boy, that I warned you in
time."</p>

<p>"No, Sir," I replied proudly; as I turned to go, "I will not remember
it; I owe you too much already for past kindness to remember
that now you endeavored to destroy the brightest prospect
of happiness which I have ever yet been blessed with.  I
will not remember it if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Poor Tom!" exclaimed Mr. Bassett as I closed the door;
but what he said besides I did not hear.  In spite of all my
boasting I felt a slight pang of jealousy, which was caused by
the cool and quiet argument of Mr. Bassett.  Pauline had
certainly manifested not a little frivolity by her flirting with Mr.
Barton, and, as I retraced my steps slowly towards friend
Goodwill's again I almost determined to ask her to explain to me
her motives in deceiving Mr. Barton.</p>

<p>As I walked dubiously along, pondering on the words of Mr.
Bassett, which I could not forget, and doing my best to smother the
jealous imp that had got possession of my thoughts, I was
suddenly startled by hearing my name spoken, and, looking up, I
saw before me Mr. Riquets and his friend Pilfor.</p>

<p>I had been so thoroughly disgusted by the conduct of these
pretenders, and had so plainly manifested my contempt for them,
that I was indignant at their impudent familiarity in addressing
me, and frowned upon the graceless rascals.  I will do Mr.

<!-- Volume II, page 137 -->

Riquets the credit to say that he blushed when I looked at him,
and appeared confused; but Mr. Pilfor, if he had ever possessed
any delicacy of feeling, or harbored an idea of personal dignity,
had long since outgrown all such things, and cared for nothing
but to gain his ends, which were to dress well and live luxuriously.
He took no notice whatever of my manner, but addressed
me in his bland voice as follows:</p>

<p>"Why, my dear fellow, how remarkably well you are looking.
I was saying to Riquets as we came along, our friend Pepper
there is one of the most <i>distingue</i> looking persons I have seen in
Broadway, in many a day."</p>

<p>"And I agreed with him, too," said his companion; "I will
go before a commissioner, if you please, and take an oath that I
never in my whole life was so impressed with the idea of a
perambulating Apollo Belvedere, as when I saw you walking
along the two-and-sixpenny side of Broadway.  Do, my dear
friend, just put yourself in an attitude now as though you were
going to slay a python, just to oblige me, and I will do anything
in my power to serve you."</p>

<p>"Be so good, then," said I, "as to oblige me by leaving me.
I prefer to be alone."</p>

<p>"O, if that's the case," said Pilfor, "I regret extremely, in
fact it gives me a good deal of uneasiness, to think that we have
interrupted you.  But we had a proposition to make to you,
which it is of some importance you should hear now."</p>

<p>"Let me save you any further trouble," said I; "I have no
money that you can rob me of, and cannot serve you at all,
neither would I if I could."</p>

<p>"O, you quite misunderstand our motives," said Mr. Riquets;
"we had not the least idea of such a thing."</p>

<p>"I am sure I am positively shocked at such an imputation,"
said Mr. Pilfor; "you evidently have imbibed a prejudice
against us, for some very inexplicable reason.  Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It is," said I, "and for no very inexplicable reason either,
as you well know."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 138 -->

<p>"Well, I am utterly astonished, I am sure," replied the perplexed-looking
Pilfor, "but I cannot help it.  The prejudices
of some people are really very strange."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mr. Riquets, throwing his head back
and flourishing his little ebony stick, "you have imbibed a prejudice
against your very best friends, now let us go into some
fashionable restaurant and imbibe a julep together, after which I
think I may venture to presume that the budding thunder gust
that seems to be lowering about us will expend into a most deliciously
bewitching full blown rainbow of contentment.  Come."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said I, "you have made a mistake this time;
I am out of pocket, and you will not succeed in getting anything
out of me.  If I go to a restaurant with you, you will have to
pay the cost yourselves."</p>

<p>"I really hope, sir, that you do not look upon us in the light
of swindlers?" said Mr. Pilfor.<p>

<p>"I must confess to you that I do," said I.</p>

<p>At this Mr. Riquets smiled in a dismal manner, and Mr. Pilfor
remarked that there was nothing more common and, at the same
time, more dangerous, than for people to form hasty opinions
about strangers.</p>

<p>"Really, gentlemen," I replied, "your attentions, just at this
time, annoy me extremely."</p>

<p>"That's very unlucky for you," said Riquets, "for we had
a proposition to make to you, which we prefer you should hear
now, as we have not the pleasure of knowing where you reside,
and may not meet you again.  If you are in a hurry we will
walk with you, or step with us into a coffee-house and we will
discuss the matter over a cup of chocolate or <i>cafe au lait</i>.</p>

<p>"That's a very charming suggestion of yours, and I think I
can pledge my honor that our rather eccentric friend will oblige
us," said Mr. Pilfor.</p>

<p>Such fellows as Mr. Pilfor, I have always observed, make a
great parade about their honor, and are willing to pledge it on
the slightest consideration.  What motive this precious pair

<!-- Volume II, page 139 -->

might have in thus fastening upon me I could not surmise, but I
knew they had some sinister end in view, and would, therefore,
have left them without hesitation had I not expected they would
dodge me and discover the retreat of Pauline.  In the hope,
therefore, of getting rid of them, I yielded to their request and
accompanied them to a coffee-house near by, but not without feeling
guilty of dissimulation in hiding my motives.  However,
my conscience acquitted me of duplicity, for I had told them
frankly enough what I thought of them, and how much I desired
to be rid of their attentions.  But it was always one of my weaknesses
to allow knaves to impose upon me.  I had a repugnance to
wounding the feelings of a rogue, even, and have many a time
allowed myself to be cheated rather than let a knave know that
I understood his real character.  In the case of Riquets and Pilfor,
however, I confess that I had no such scruples, for I had discovered
that it was no mortification to them to be found out in
their knaveries.  They were of that numerous class of adventurers
who think that to be well dressed is to do well, and who
confound shabbiness of apparel with shabbiness of conduct,
and who imagine that fine linen and fine feelings are synonymous
terms.  Mr. Pilfor had an artistic eye for dress, and I cannot
deny him the credit of looking like a gentleman everywhere but
in his countenance, which no art can prevent from being the
symbol of the mind, to those who can read it truly.  Mr. Riquets,
on the contrary, in spite of his fine dress, had the look of an
organ-grinder or an image-vender, and the manner in which he
carried his head suggested at once the thought of his having carried
a board upon it.  Both of these fellows professed a great love
for art, and, like Sophia Ruby, were continually talking about
the beautiful, but without any of Mrs. Ruby's sincerity or single-heartedness.
They professed to an ecstatic veneration for art
but had no feeling for nature; they did not, like Mr. Ardent, the
painter, love art because she stood for nature, but they mistook
the tinsel and trinkets of art for art itself, as they mistook a man's
clothes for the man himself.  Although bearing no possible resemblance

<!-- Volume II, page 140 -->

to each other externally, there never were two persons
of the male sex better matched than were Pilfor and Riquets
for being alike base they could feel no shame or degradation in
each other's society.</p>

<p>"Come," said I, as we sat down at one of the small marble
tables in the coffee-house into which I had permitted myself to be
drawn, "come, let me know at once what your business is with
me, that I may go."</p>

<p>"O, by all means," said Mr. Pilfor, "we would not be guilty
of the rudeness of detaining you against your will for the whole
world.  Would we, Riquets?"</p>

<p>"I would as soon think of detaining a perfumed zephyr, as his
feet tripped over my perspiring brow of a summer afternoon,"
replied Mr. Riquets.  "But, come, let us have our <i>cafe au lait</i> and
a cracker."</p>

<p>The coffee and the crackers were brought, and Mr. Riquets,
as if to relieve my mind from any uneasiness, paid for them in
very prompt manner.</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir," said Pilfor, "Riquets and myself, and two
other literary gentlemen"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why don't you name them at once," said his companion,
"and save any further inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Well, I will, but I beg you will remember it is done in confidence,"
said Mr. Pilfor.  I bowed, and he proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"The two gentlemen, in fact, are both known to you, and are
two very remarkable persons: Mr. Jasper Ferocious and Mr.
Tibbings.  Ferocious is really a man of remarkable genius, and
Tibbings is quite a person in his way, although it is rather a
small way; but he is such a gentlemanly creature!"</p>

<p>"He is a perfect amenity of literature," observed Mr. Riquets,
parenthetically.</p>

<p>"He is quite so, indeed," observed Mr. Pilfor, "and us four
will make up a very desirable quartette party, but I have a superstitious
veneration for the number five.  There is luck in it, and
so Riquets and myself have concluded to invite you to join us."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 141 -->

<p>"Join you!"  I exclaimed, "and what, pray tell me, shall I
join you in?"</p>

<p>"One of the most magnificent enterprises of the age," said
Riquets, "something that will immortalize us all and make us as
rich as Rothschild and Astor put together.  You will be completely
fascinated when you hear the scheme."</p>

<p>"I fear not," I replied, "but let me hear it.  I have a scheme
of my own on hand which is sufficiently fascinating."</p>

<p>"It is a buttercup to a butternut tree compared with ours,"
said Riquets, as he jerked his head back as though he had a design
of throwing it off his shoulders; "but show him our plan,
Pilfor; let it rain its balmy influence upon his soul."</p>

<p>"This is it," said Mr. Pilfor, as he drew himself out and
seemed to elongate like an opera glass; "it is one of the most
capital things that was ever conceived for making a fortune and
achieving a most desirable reputation."</p>

<p>"But what is it to me?" said I impatiently, for I was fearful
that something might befall Pauline if I prolonged my absence.</p>

<p>"You shall see all in good time, sir," replied Pilfor, with an
important flourish of his hand.  "This is our scheme."</p>

<p>"Look out now for rainbows and aurora borealises," exclaimed
Mr. Riquets; "you will be perfectly entranced and
taken off your feet."</p>

<p>"We propose," continued Mr. Pilfor drawing a paper from his
pocket, "to establish a new and brilliant paper in this city to be
called the Quizzing Glass."</p>

<p>"Isn't the idea a most felicitously enchanting one!" exclaimed
his companion.</p>

<p>"The object we have in view is to shoot folly on the wing, to
satirize vice, to hold up to public scorn the follies and fashions of
the age, to furnish a perfect magazine of refined wit, genial humor
and trenchant criticism, and to preserve, withal, a high
moral tone, and teach the world important lessons in good behavior,"
said Mr. Pilfor, or rather read from the paper he held
in his hand.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 142 -->

<p>"Isn't it a perfectly brilliant undertaking?" said Riquets.</p>

<p>"Perfectly so, it strikes me," I said, "but most brilliantly
ridiculous for you.  Pray do you intend to do this by yourselves."</p>

<p>"O, no, by no means," said Mr. Pilfor, "we have already
engaged the services of Mr. Ferocious, a most remarkable person
and Mr. Tibbings who has got money; and will lend us
the use of his name as we have told you already."</p>

<p>"Well, I have listened to your plans, but as I do not see that
they are of any consequence to me," I replied, "I shall not stop
to hear anything further."</p>

<p>"Stop one minute, if you please," exclaimed Mr. Riquets as
both he and his companion caught hold of my arm.  "Stop one
moment my dear fellow, you are such an original genius that
really we would be most happy to have you join us in our enterprise."</p>

<p>"Not, I," I replied, "let me go.  I desire no connection with
you."</p>

<p>"O, then, we have another very liberal proposition to make to
you.  We will give you a share of the profits in our paper,
if you chose to become a part proprietor.  We will not require
any money from you, but will take your note of hand for your
share of the capital."</p>

<p>I could not exactly comprehend the designs of these rascals in
making this attack upon me, but I was well assured they had
some sinister motive which they endeavored to cover up by their
absurd proposals.  Their nefarious plans leaked out a few days
afterwards, but at the time I was at a loss to conceive of their
motives.  I had become too impatient to return to my darling
Pauline to waste more time on them and in spite of their efforts
to detain me, I broke away from them and again found myself
in the street.  My first impulse was to run with all my might
towards friend Goodwill's, but fear of being watched compelled
me to a more moderate and prudent course.</p>

<p>So, avoiding the public streets, I made my way cautiously

<!-- Volume II, page 143 -->

through the by-ways of the city, until I reached friend Goodwill's
house, where I found things in a very different position
from what I had left them.  The whole family was in a ferment,
and my darling Pauline was in tears, and on the verge of hysterics.
The cause of this new difficulty proceeded from a quarter
where I had least anticipated any embarrassment.  During
my absence from the Goodwill's, the hitherto gentle and loving
Desire had returned, and on being introduced to Pauline, and
informed of the reason of her being there, that modest young
lady had become dreadfully excited, and insisted on Pauline's
being turned out of doors before I returned.  But the good old
lady would not countenance such a ruthless and unfeeling
proposition on the part of her daughter.  Notwithstanding that
Desire had on all occasions shown so great a liking for me, she
now refused to speak to me, and exhibited a degree of passion
that quite confounded me.  As soon as I entered the room,
Pauline flew into my arms, and entreated me to remain in the
house no longer, and expressed as much abhorrence for Desire as
that young friend had for herself.  I was shocked beyond expression
to find how unfortunately things had gone at the Goodwill's,
and was grievously disappointed at the reception of Pauline
by the hitherto affectionate and gentle Desire.  But there was
no other course for me than to leave the house with Pauline,
which I instantly did, accompanied by the parting blessing of
Mrs. Goodwill and the frowns of her daughter.</p>

<p>"It is very odd, dear Pauline," said I, "that Desire Goodwill,
who appeared so partial to me before, should suddenly express
such a dislike for me now."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Walter," replied Pauline, clinging to my side,
"what an innocent you are.  It was not you that she disliked,
but me for being loved by you.  O, dear Walter, promise me
that you will never see her again.  She is a wicked creature."</p>

<p>I promised that I would not.</p>

<p>"And now, Pauline, let us go to Sophia Ruby's; she is a true
friend to the unfortunate, and such a worshipper of the beautiful,

<!-- Volume II, page 144 -->

that she will be proud to have you in her keeping; she has always
some fugitive or other under her care, and is never so unhappy
as when not contributing to the happiness of others.  If
she was not such a lover of the True as well as the Beautiful,
and whatever is true, I believe, she esteems as beautiful, I should
think that my candor had sometimes offended her."</p>

<p>"Is she beautiful?" asked Pauline.</p>

<p>"Not so beautiful as you are, Pauline," I replied; "but it is
no fault of hers, for she tries to make herself so that she may afford
pleasure to others."</p>

<p>"How amiable it is in her, I am sure I shall love her," replied
Pauline.</p>

<p>There was such a sweet sincerity in Pauline's manner, that as
soon as I saw her I forgot all the jealous feelings which had been
awakened by the remarks of Mr. Bassett, and I no longer entertained
the least doubt of her devotion to me.  So entirely free
from anything like the calculating prudence of some young ladies
was Pauline, that when I told her of my unsuccessful application
for money to Mr. Bassett, she seemed to cling to me more
fondly than ever.  Our walk to Mrs. Ruby's house was but a
short one, yet short as it was, it was long enough to give me renewed
confidence in Pauline, and, if possible, to increase my love
for that entrancing creature.  The unexpected termination of our
visit to the Goodwills had rather shaken my confidence in meeting
a kind reception at Mrs. Ruby's, but that philanthropic soul
received us as warmly and commended us for our courage as
heartily as though we had been her own children.</p>

<p>"You have done perfectly right," said Mrs. Ruby to Pauline,
"in consulting your affections rather than the will of your
parents or the custom of society.  If your parents really love
you, they will approve whatever gives you the most pleasure,
but if they are so very unnatural as to wish you to marry to
please them rather than yourself, I do not think they are entitled
to obedience from you; as for society I do not think its laws are
entitled to the consideration of an independent mind; for my own

<!-- Volume II, page 145 -->

part, I have long since turned my back upon it, and owe it
nothing.  The true law of life is enjoyment; whatever adds to
your happiness is lawful, and the only sin is the infliction of misery.
Suffering is such a discord in the harmony of nature that
I do not think it has any right to be in the world, and that
therefore everybody is bound to do something towards extinguishing
it by cultivating the true and the beautiful.  Everybody
cannot be beautiful, but everybody can be true, and truth
and beauty are more nearly akin than perhaps you are willing
to believe."</p>

<p>Pauline was charmed with the philosophy of Mrs. Ruby, it
was so unlike the asceticism which had been always preached to
her by her parents, who regarded all enjoyments as sinful, and
as religiously believed in the necessity of cultivating crosses and
hardships, as Mrs. Ruby did in the opposite doctrine.  This philosophical
philanthropist was dressed with uncommon gaiety, and
her hair had been cultivated to that extreme of beauty that it had
become a bright purple.  She had received us in a lower room,
but after we had explained the cause of our visit, she invited us
to walk up into her boudoir, where, to use her own language, we
should meet one of the truest loves of harmony, a purely intellectual
nature, whose daily food was music, and whose spirit
was like an infinite circle, it was so comprehensive and embracing.
Pauline, as well as myself, would have preferred not to
see Mrs. Ruby's intellectual friend, and so we told her, but as
she insisted, and we had thrown ourselves upon her protection,
we had to yield to her desires; and on stepping into her boudoir
were equally astonished and vexed to find in the remarkable gentleman,
no greater person than Professor Sprads.  No sooner did
the ardent Professor catch a glimpse of me than he ran and embraced
me with a great show of enthusiasm, and Mrs. Ruby's
benevolent countenance fairly beamed with delight.  Poor Pauline
was so much astonished and frightened at finding a person
to whom she was known that she nearly fainted.</p>

<p>"So then you know them, Professor?" said Mrs. Ruby.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 146 -->

<p>"Know them!" exclaimed the Professor in an ecstasy: "O,
no! of course, not.  I rather should venture upon the assertion
that I didn't know anybody else; excepting, of course," bowing
gallantly to Mrs. Ruby. "our distinguished friend, whom not to
know is to be worse than unknown."</p>

<p>"How delightful these accidental re-unions of old friends are,"
said Mrs. Ruby, "and how many such will there not be in the
infinite future."</p>

<p>"Admirable idea!  Magnificent! superb! delicious thought!
How delighted Madame Sprads would be to listen to such gushings
of a poetical soul!  So perfectly delicious in feeling, so superb
in conception, so beautifully, admirably expressed!" exclaimed
the Professor, clasping his hands together, and casting
his eyes up imploringly to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a most remarkable creature?" whispered Mrs.
Ruby; "he has such sympathies with the true and the beautiful."</p>

<p>"Ah! you should see the pleasure of Madame Sprads in listening
to poetry like that.  I do actually, positively, and decidedly
believe that it would excite her to that degree that she could
not contain herself.  I do actually believe it," said the  Professor;
"I have often remarked to her that my divine and most
charming friend would really prove too much for her nerves,
she is such an extraordinarily sensitive creature; so much
soul!"</p>

<p>"I am such an enthusiast in music," said Mrs. Ruby, "that I
love everybody who helps to produce harmony in the world,
because I feel that it is by harmonious circles rising one above
another that the divine truths of the universe are sustained."</p>

<p>"What a deliciously profound thought!" exclaimed Professor
Sprads; "upon my word, Mr. Pepper, I would give any amount
of money if Madame Sprads could have heard that delicious remark."</p>

<p>As I had told Mrs. Ruby our exact situation, how I had run
off with Pauline, and wished to find her a shelter where she

<!-- Volume II, page 147 -->

would be safe from the pursuit of her father, until I could find
employment which would enable me to provide a suitable home
for her, and had also explained to Mrs. Ruby my own penniless
condition, it would be in the last degree ungrateful and base if I
did not here acknowledge the generosity of her conduct, and
confess myself indebted to her for her unselfish liberality towards
Pauline and me.  So far from our necessities or improvidences
affecting in the least degree her conduct, or causing her to regard
us with coolness or suspicion, she seemed to feel more
kindly disposed and more earnest in her desire to make us feel
entirely at home in her house.  But Mrs. Ruby was a remarkable
exception to the rest of the world, she felt no particular sympathy
for those who were well provided for, and basking in the
sunshine of fortune, unless they happened to be of a musical
turn, but the afflicted of all degrees and colors, were sure to find
in her a sympathizer; the greatest sinners, however, came in
for the largest share of her sympathy, and those who were most
indifferent about themselves, found in her the most abiding friend.
It was enough for her to know that assistance was needed, without
inquiring into the cause, and if she could not afford the required
aid from her own income, she always sought for it among
those who had the means, and knew her character well enough to
trust in her dispensing their charity properly.  Professor Sprads
had called upon her to solicit her aid in bringing before the public
by the means of those preliminary notices of the Press, without
which no new scheme can ever be successful in an age like
ours, which takes its form and pressure wholly from the newspapers;
and he had just finished his exposition of his plan as we
entered.  Mrs. Ruby, it appeared had entered zealously into the
Professor's views, and promised him all the aid her pen could
render him.  Thinking that we might be of service to the Professor
and the Professor to us, and that by forming a league with
him we might safely marry, and so get up a very pretty little romance;
and next to getting some poor wretch released from
prison, or rescuing a frail sister from her abandoned course of

<!-- Volume II, page 148 -->

life, there was nothing that gave Mrs. Ruby so much satisfaction,
as promoting a run-a-way match.  In doing so she only
thought of the pleasure of the runaways, and the tyranny of the
parents, and never of the misfortunes that might grow out of the
marriage to any of the parties interested.  She was an optimist to
the extent of believing that every thing should be all right and
pleasant in the world; and so much opposed was she to suffering
of all kind, that she was puzzled to account for such a manifest
mistake in nature as discord.  All things, she insisted,
ought to be in harmony, and she was almost vexed that they
were not.</p>

<p>"Your coming here this afternoon," said Mrs. Ruby, turning
to me, "is really providential.  Professor Sprads has just been
telling me of a project which you and Pauline can join in, and
it will be to your advantage, and give you both a very delightful
position.  You would not object to our young friends joining in
your enterprise, Professor."</p>

<p>Here the Professor clapped his hands together, and gave
another imploring look at the ceiling, as though the bare mention
of such a thing had deprived him of speech.</p>

<p>"It isn't just the thing of all others which I should desire
most," said the Professor.  "Of course, not; O, no!"</p>

<p>"He is such an enthusiastic creature," said Mrs. Ruby.</p>

<p>"And Madam Sprads wouldn't be delighted; of course, not,"
continued the Professor, "and it isn't perfectly delicious; by no
means.  I am enraptured at the thought.  What a splendid connection
it will be for them.  And such mints of money!"</p>

<p>"Pray, what is this scheme?" said I, "which is to produce
such mints of money, and work such wonders?"</p>

<p>"The Professor," said Mrs. Ruby, "is about to get up a
family, and he wants two such young persons as you and Pauline
to assist him, and really I think you may be of great service
to him."</p>

<p>"Isn't it exquisite!  Perfectly delicious!" said the Professor,
grasping my head and shaking it vehemently.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 149 -->

<p>"A family!" said I, quite at a loss to conceive his meaning.</p>

<p>"O, no! of course, not.  Not <i>a</i> family, but <i>the</i> Sprads family.
Delicious, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Really I am at a loss to conceive how I can aid you in such
an attempt." said I, still more embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Such delicious innocence!" exclaimed the Professor, "it is
positively refreshing.  Quite so.  Madam Sprads will certainly
die when I tell her.  I shall lose that most estimable woman I
know. Exquisite!"</p>

<p>"Be so good," said I, "as to explain your scheme."</p>

<p>"My scheme is simply this, and you will not approve of it,
of course, certainly not." said the Professor, with an ironical
wink, "such a perfectly delicious scheme nobody would approve
who happened to be in want of money and a splendid connection.</p>

<p>"I propose, sir, to get up a Sprads family." said the Professor,
grandly, "for the purpose of giving concerts.  Don't you think
it a perfectly magnificent idea?  The Sprads family!  Madame
Sprads has the most delicious soprano; she is to be the sister
and the prima donna assoluta of the family.  If a more superb
voice than Madame Sprads' was ever heard in the San Carlos
Opera House, I should like to know whose it was, that's all. I
am to be the elder brother and the basso; and you and Miss
Pauline shall be the young brother and sister; I have already
engaged a third brother, who is to be the buffo of the family; he
is a little old, but he can be trimmed up very well, and with some
new teeth and a gentleman's real head of hair, he will pass off
by gas light for as young a man as myself."</p>

<p>"But, Professor," said I, "do you really make such a proposition
to me in seriousness?"</p>

<p>"I never was more serious in my life, sir," replied he, with a
flourish; "why shouldn't I be?  Think of the sensation we
shall create.  Large bills posted all about the streets with THE
SPRADS FAMILY in immense capitals; then there will be the
notices in the papers; bouquets thrown on the stage whenever
we appear; all our portraits beautifully lithographed and placed

<!-- Volume II, page 150 -->

in the windows of the music stores; then there will be the Sprads
Soirees, the Sprads Polkas, the Sprads quadrilles, the Sprads hats,
the Sprads everything.  O, it will be perfectly delicious! heavenly!
superb! Why shouldn't I be serious?"</p>

<p>"But, as charming as it appears to you, Professor, it strikes
me very differently; for I could not consent to deceive the public
by passing myself off as your brother, even though I had no
objections of a more serious nature to assuming the name of
Sprads," said I.</p>

<p>"What, not when you could make such a perfectly splendid
connection by doing so!" asked the Professor with unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>"The Professor's love of art is so strong," said Mrs. Ruby,
"and his soul is so wrapped up in music that he has no opportunity
to cultivate a love of truth, which is a passion by itself.&mdash;But
from my own stand-point of observation I can appreciate and
reverence the worship for the beautiful which I discover in both
of you."</p>

<p>"What a magnificent conception!" exclaimed the Professor
again; "if Madam Sprads could have heard that brilliant remark
I don't positively think she could ever have survived
it."</p>

<p>"If you will allow me," said Mrs. Ruby, "I think I can suggest
a plan that will meet the objection of Mr. Pepper and also
serve the purposes of the Professor."</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Professor Sprads, smiling and bowing;
"Of course she can.  That remarkable woman, as I have often
said to Madame Sprads, in the sanctuary of our fire-side, can do
any thing.  She is a perfect Crichton, only she is more admirable,
every way.  Listen to her:" and the Professor looked
knowingly at me.</p>

<p>"Since you have scruples about assuming the name of
Sprads," said Mrs. Ruby to me, "and your love of the Beautiful and
the True will not permit you to call yourself by any other name
than that of Pepper, why not call the association the Pepper

<!-- Volume II, page 151 -->

Family?"  "Never!  Never!" cried the Professor, leaping
from his seat; "What, Madam Sprads give up her splendid
reputation, and be called Madam Pepper!  And I Professor Pepper!
O, it's deliciously absurd!  The Pepper family!  O, it's
delightful."</p>

<p>"But it's idle to dispute about the matter," said I, "for I cannot
sing; and as for Pauline, she must not appear in public.
There are other means of procuring a subsistence than by singing;
so you must not count upon the assistance of Pauline and I
in getting up a family, Professor."</p>

<p>Pauline had sat during the whole of this ridiculous discussion,
with her veil closely drawn, and apparently agitated, but whether
by mirth or grief I did not know.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Professor, "very well; there are whole
armies of eligible ladies and gentlemen who will be most happy
to join us; and such a splendid soprano as Madam Sprads can
have no difficulty in getting up a most attractive family.  Then
don't throw away a most superb chance for a splendid connection.
O, no, of course not.  That's all."</p>

<p>And having thus delivered his sentiments, the Professor grandly
withdrew, for there was an air of grandeur in everything that
the little man did.</p>

<p>"Professor Sprads is a man of genius, I know," said Mrs.
Ruby, "but he has his peculiarities, as all men of genius have."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is certainly a very singular person," said I, "but his
genius all seems to lie in the inordinate estimate which he places
upon the powers of that remarkable woman, Madame Sprads, as
a delicious soprano."</p>

<p>"He reminds me of Beethoven in his impetuosity," said Mrs.
Ruby, "and I certainly do not esteem him the less for having a
good opinion of his wife, who is a most remarkable woman; at
least I think she must be a remarkable woman who could inspire
him with such a profound regard for her genius.  But,
perhaps this is an unpleasant subject to you, and you would prefer
talking about your own affairs."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 152 -->

<p>"I would, indeed," I replied, "for it is time that we resolved
what to do."</p>

<p>"You of course love each other," said Mrs. Ruby, glancing
toward Pauline, who blushed a deep scarlet.</p>

<p>"Of course we do," I replied.</p>

<p>"And you are willing to make
any sacrifices for the sake of each other," continued Mrs. Ruby.</p>

<p>"Yes," sweetly whispered Pauline, as she looked tenderly in
my face.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "we would undergo any labor, or endure any
hardship, if we might but live with each other."</p>

<p>"Then why not be married now?" said Mrs. Ruby, "you
will certainly not increase your hardships by being married, and
the enjoyment of each other's society will be a solace to you in
your troubles."</p>

<p>This was so much in accordance with our own way of viewing
the matter that we agreed entirely with Mrs. Ruby, and assured
her that we were not only quite willing to be married, but
that we most ardently desired the consummation of our vows;
the only bar to our doing so being the want of a home.</p>

<p>"That shall be no hindrance," replied Mrs. Ruby; "you
shall have a home here until you are able to provide one for
yourself.  My style of living is plain; but, such as it is, you
shall be heartily welcome."</p>

<p>Pauline was so overcome by the goodness of this generous-hearted
woman that she threw her arms about her neck and
kissed her.  As for myself, I was quite wild with joy, and
proposed going for a clergyman immediately.  Mrs. Ruby and
Pauline both seconded the resolution, and without waiting for
any further discussion, I took my hat and was just leaving the
house to go in pursuit of a clergyman, when Pauline called me
back, and whispering in my ear that a plain gold ring would be
necessary, she slipped her purse into my hand, and giving me a
gentle push, closed the door upon me, or I know not what I
might have done.  As Pauline had gone out on a shopping
expedition, her purse was well filled; but I would have died

<!-- Volume II, page 153 -->

sooner than have used a shilling that it contained.  I put the precious
treasure in my pocket, and set off in pursuit of a clergyman,
and fortunately found one in the next street, who promised
me that he would go directly to the house of Mrs. Ruby, as
soon as he could put on his gown, and would wait for my return.
There being no jeweler's shop in the neighborhood, I
was obliged to go further to purchase a ring.  I had proceeded
but a short distance from the clergyman's house, when, as I was
turning the corner of the street, I saw on the opposite side old
Gil and Mr. Barton, followed by two men who had the appearance
of police officers.  My first impulse was to turn and run
but as that would be showing a want of candor, and might justly
subject me to the charge of deception, I walked boldly towards
them.  As soon as old Gil and Mr. Barton perceived me they
ran across the street, and calling to the two men behind them to
follow them, cried out&mdash;"Here's the villain; seize him before he
escapes."  The two officers directly laid hold of my collar,
and as I had shown them that I was not disposed to run from
them, I felt under no necessity of submitting to such an indignity,
and I saluted each of them with a blow in face, and
told them to take their hands off.  But they kept a strong hold of
me, and were ordered by Mr. Barton not to let me escape.</p>

<p>"Escape!"  I exclaimed, "from what, or whom, should I escape?
What is the meaning of this attack upon me?"</p>

<p>"The meaning of it is that you are a villain," said Mr. Barton,
"and you are going to be punished for your villainies."</p>

<p>"Where is my daughter?" said old Gil, "whom you have enticed
away from me, to repay me for the kindness I showed you,
and for taking you into my house when you were starving, you
vagabond."</p>

<p>"Your daughter is safe," I said, "and where she prefers living
to bring forced to marry a man she despises."</p>

<p>"Gag the rascal!" acclaimed Mr. Barton; "search his pockets
officers, he may have some deadly weapons concealed about
him."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 154 -->

<p>"I will save them the trouble," said I, taking from my pockets
their contents, among which was Pauline's purse.</p>

<p>"The villain has robbed my daughter of her purse," said old
Gil, as he caught sight of that precious article.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's enough to convict him," said Mr. Barton, "the
rascal!  Not content with obtaining the poor child, he must pick
her pockets. What an atrocious villain he is.  Officers keep a
good hold of him."</p>

<p>Such vile accusations as these made my blood boil, and, in my
anger I struggled hard to escape from the grip of the mercenary
wretches who had seized me; not that I would have run from old
Gil, or the hypocritical financier, Mr. Barton, but that I might
get hold of the specious rogue, and repay his insolence.  But
they were too powerful for me, and my rage almost paralyzed
me.  To be accused of robbing my dear Pauline, for whom I
would have gladly sacrificed my life, was so vile a charge that I
could not submit to it, and, if I had been free, I would have made
the bank-President repent his insolence towards me.  Old Gil I
could pardon, for Pauline was his favorite daughter, and anything
that he might accuse me of I could attribute to his grief at
her loss, but the cool and wily Mr. Barton, I did not believe had
any love for Pauline, although he was so anxious to marry her,
and I could only attribute his vile charge to a malignant spite
against me as his rival.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you have done with my daughter?" said old
Gil, "and you shall go free.  I will not prosecute you even for
robbing her, or for your crime in abducting her.  All that I
want is my child.  I have no revengeful feelings against you,
notwithstanding your shameful abuse of my confidence."</p>

<p>"Be careful how you promise," said Mr. Barton, "the villain
must be punished; he must be put out of the way of doing any
more harm.  If you are willing I forgive him I am not.  It is
time he was under the charge of the State.  Look out for him
officer; if you allow him to escape, I shall hold you responsible."</p>

<p>"As for you," said I to Mr. Barton, giving him as contemptuous

<!-- Volume II, page 155 -->

a look as I could, "I despise you too much to make
any explanation to you.  But to the father of Pauline I owe an
apology for my conduct, and I love her too sincerely not to respect
her father."</p>

<p>"Don't let him blarney you," said Mr. Barton; "you know
what a romancer he is."</p>

<p>"I don't fear his blarney," said old Gil; "he knows me too
well to think that I can be influenced by it.  Tell me, Walter,
what you have done with Pauline; my heart aches for the misguided
child.  It is you that has enticed her from her home and
her duty."</p>

<p>"Pauline is well and safe," said I; "no harm can befall her
while she remains in the asylum to which she voluntarily followed
me.  I have put no constraint upon her, and if she wishes
to return home I shall not oppose it.  But I will not reveal the
secret of her retreat, unless you promise that she shall not be
annoyed by the addresses of a man whom she despises."</p>

<p>"Make the rascal no promises," said Mr. Barton, "there will
be no difficulty in finding Pauline, the villain has taken her to
one of his infamous haunts.  Hold him hard officers, unless you
wish to lose your reward.  Trust to me for finding Pauline."</p>

<p>"You have not been married, Pepper?" said old Gil.</p>

<p>"No," said I.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him," said Mr. Barton, "I'll warrant he has
done more than that."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p>THE result of my capture by the father of Pauline and her intended
husband, the bank-president, was a nights' confinement in
the city prison on a charge of abducting the young lady and
robbing her of her purse, which the inexorable officer of the law
deprived me of.  Being in great distress on account of Pauline,

<!-- Volume II, page 156 -->

and knowing that her tender heart would be pierced with fears
for my safety, and fearing, myself, that she might suspect me of
deserting her intentionally, I wrote a note explaining to her the
cause of my absence, and beseeching her to remain quietly under
the protection of Mrs. Ruby until I could procure bail, and
be set at liberty once more.  I hired one of the turnkeys of the
prison to deliver the letter, but the treacherous knave, instead of
conveying it to Mrs. Ruby's, immediately carried it to old Gil,
who thereby discovered Pauline's retreat, and having secured
the darling girl, he caused me to be set at liberty the next morning.
Not knowing what had happened, immediately on regaining
my freedom, I hastened to Mrs. Ruby's and was made acquainted
with the fact of Pauline's being carried off by her father.
I knew it would be useless to attempt to regain access to Pauline,
and had no doubt that she would be compelled to marry Mr.
Barton, for I could not but acknowledge to myself that Pauline,
although I had no doubt of her love for me, was easily persuaded
by those who had any claim upon her affections.</p>

<p>I was foiled in my matrimonial attempts, and now that Pauline
had been removed from my sight my passions were cooled, and
I saw that I had been on the point of committing a very great
folly, for it would have been wretchedly thoughtless to involve a
generous and confiding girl in my own embarrassments and miseries,
resulting from my want of reliable means of support.  And
I could not but wonder that so well meaning a person as Mrs.
Ruby should have encouraged us in our inconsiderate designs.
But that tender hearted philanthropist so delighted in seeing other
people happy that she never looked beyond the immediate effects
of her measures and schemes.  She was a mere child in her
feelings, and played with human beings as though they were
toys, caring nothing more about them than for the gratification
which their oddities or pleasures afforded her fancy.  It was a
pleasing sight to her to see two ardent and thoughtless young persons,
like Pauline and I, made happy by being married, and
therefore she encouraged our thoughtless folly, without reflecting

<!-- Volume II, page 157 -->

on the ultimate misery of such an act to ourselves and our friends.</p>

<p>It was because wickedness was so very disagreeable to her,
that Mrs. Ruby was so great a reformer, for it annoyed her by
its hideousness, rather than outraged her sense of justice.  The
beautiful was never wicked in her eyes, and an agreeable sinner
had, for her, all the excellencies of a saint.  She talked a good
deal about the inner life, but she was most affected by the outward
show of things; and whatever seemed fair, was, to her,
fair.  Although I readily discovered the true character of Mrs.
Ruby, and saw that she loved the beautiful on account of its
agreeableness, and not because it was true, as was plainly enough
shown by the arts which she employed in the embellishment of
her own person; yet I felt flattered by her evident partiality for
me, and loved her because she seemed to take so much interest
in my welfare.  In relating to me the particulars of Pauline's
meeting with her father, she seemed to regard the whole affair as
a little romantic entertainment which had been got up expressly
for her pleasure; and my own vexation seemed to afford her as
much gratification as any part of the little drama.</p>

<p>Dear, sensuous Mrs. Ruby, what a charmed life she led, in
her little sanctuary, surrounded by singing birds, and flowers,
and German engravings of celestial ladies, with eyes upturned,
and their fingers engaged in sweeping over the strings of a harp,
instead of sweeping with a broom.  Although there were not
many such persons as Mrs. Ruby in the world, yet there were a
good many who had a reverence for her, and regarded her as
another Saint Cecilia. Music being the most sensuous of the
fine arts, and making its appeals solely to the feelings, while it
leaves the reason unmoved, it was the favorite passion of Mrs.
Ruby, who loved the excitement which it caused in her feelings,
and saved her the trouble of thinking.  All musicians, therefore,
were most kindly entertained by Mrs. Ruby, and some of
them, like Professor Sprads, made use of her generous nature
for the purpose of furthering their own designs.  But Mrs.
Ruby, with all her weaknesses, was a true woman, and a

<!-- Volume II, page 158 -->

genuine philanthropist, for even though some of her acts were
not dictated by a far-reaching wisdom, yet they were all calculated
to render somebody happy; there was no ill-nature in her
making, nor anything of that satanic disposition, which gives so
keen a perception of the foibles and imperfections of other people
as to render its possessor continually unhappy, and disagreeable
to others.  No, Mrs. Ruby imparted cheerfulness to others by
her own cheerful and summery feelings; and in spite of my
disappointments and chagrins I left her feeling tolerably well
content with myself.  But once out of the warm atmosphere of
her presence, I was again chilled to the heart by reflecting on
my perfectly destitute and wretched condition, and resolved once
more to make a character and position for myself in the world or
die in the attempt.</p>

<p>It is very easy to resolve to do great things, but performance
is another matter; and a youth with a bad character, without
money, and with but one friend, in a great city, is in a most
hopeless condition to achieve greatness, or even gain money.  As
I had made my own character by my unfortunate mistake in
supposing that a falsehood could be made to answer the purposes
of truth, I had no one to blame for my mishaps but myself; but
I could not help murmuring that since I had made so many
sacrifices to preserve my integrity, and had done so much to establish
a character for sincerity and truthfulness, that so many
accidents had thwarted my intentions.</p>

<p>I had no other resource now than my unwavering friend, Mr.
Bassett, who had been my good angel from the beginning, and
preserved me many times from ruin.  So, on leaving Mrs.
Ruby's house, I proceeded directly to Mr. Bassett's counting-room,
and was received by that excellent man with the same appearance
of cordiality and kind-heartedness that he had always
manifested towards me.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," said he as I was about to speak, "so, you
have been again in difficulty."</p>

<p>"Alas, sir," I replied, "I fear I shall never again be free

<!-- Volume II, page 159 -->

from it.  I must seek my fortune in another country where my
name is unknown, and the past acts of my life will not be stumbling
blocks in my way."</p>

<p>"Poor Tom!" said Mr. Bassett, "you have had a troublesome
time of it since you took upon yourself the responsibility of
your conduct.  But do not be discouraged.  What do you need
most to enable you to accomplish your designs?"</p>

<p>"Money! money!" I exclaimed in a frenzy; "I can do nothing
without money. No one will believe the word of a pauper;
there is an impression, I find, that truth must have a property
basis.  The same people who respected me when I had money
now laugh at me when they find I have nothing in my pocket."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are coming to your senses," said Mr. Bassett,
patting me on the shoulder; "you would refuse my offers
of assistance, and thought you could make yourself famous for
truth without a dollar in your pocket; and you might have succeeded,
Tom, if you had persevered, and chosen to live poor and
neglected, that you might be well spoken of after you were dead;
for the acts of men are judged of without any reference to their
wealth after they leave the world.  But that is a costly way of
procuring a reputation, for you have to sacrifice everything to
obtain it, which is worth possessing.  Let people say what
they will, Tom, about Fame, it is a frivolous thing to live for;
it is something that cannot be enjoyed, and is well called by the
Poet, the last infirmity of noble minds.  I believe I have quoted
the expression correctly, but the sentiment is a just one.  The
most famous men have cared least about fame, and never knew
that they were well known."</p>

<p>"It is not fame that I desire," I replied, "but an honorable reputation,
that I may prove myself worthy of the name of my
father."</p>

<p>"It is an honorable ambition, Tom," said Mr. Bassett, "and I
applaud your motives.  Try to believe so that I may applaud
your conduct.  You have tried the purifying influence of poverty,
and now you should try the opposite course.  Wealth has

<!-- Volume II, page 160 -->

greater temptations than want, and since you have said you want
money, you shall have it."</p>

<p>"I did not come here to beg," said I.</p>

<p>"I know you did not, and I am not going to treat you as a
beggar," said he, "but as a friend.  You want money; well,
why should I not supply your want? but, you want a character,
too; that I cannot supply.  If character must have a property
basis, as you think, you shall have the basis to begin with, and
we will see what kind of a structure you rear upon it, and
whether you will prove yourself worthy to bear the name of St.
Hugh, if your father should ever be restored to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett then opened his check book, and reached me a
draft on the bank of which Mr. Barton was president, for ten
thousand dollars.  I was surprised at the sum, and refused to accept
it.  But Mr. Bassett compelled me to take it by assuring
me that if I did not he should construe my refusal into an act of
unkindness to himself.  He would listen to no refusal, and
insisted that I should take it without making any other promise
than that I would call upon him for more when it should be all
spent.  He also released me from the obligation which he had
before imposed upon me of informing him of every new undertaking
which I might engage in, and told me I was free to act as
I liked, to go where I pleased and come when I pleased.  I was
so deeply affected by this generous conduct on the part of Mr.
Bassett, and so puzzled by the strangeness of his conduct, that I
knew not what to say.  But I took the draft, and left the counting-room
of my benefactor, almost bewildered by the apparently
good fortune which had befallen me.  Mr. Bassett really seemed
to take delight in conferring benefits upon me, and, as I took my
leave of him, he shook my hand so cordially, and appeared to
enjoy my surprise so much that I could not help feeling that I
had been conferring a benefit upon him in accepting his liberal
gift.</p>

<p>But, what was I to do with this large sum of money, which had
been so suddenly put in my possession?  A suspicion crossed my

<!-- Volume II, page 161 -->

mind that it had been given to test my character; but why should
Mr. Bassett wish to indulge in so costly an experiment.  He
professed to have already entire confidence in my integrity, and
he could hope for no personal advantage to himself from my future
course of life.  I was puzzled to fathom his motives; but
the money was in my possession, and my first impulse was to
make a display of it.  So, having drawn the amount from the
Bank, I called upon old Gil, whom I found sitting at his tattered
old desk precisely as I had first seen him, with a heap of papers
before him, and his person bearing the same marks of carelessness.
He looked up in my face, as I entered his dingy little office,
inquiringly, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>"I have called upon you for assistance," said I, as he seemed
to be waiting for an explanation of my visit.</p>

<p>"Assistance!" he exclaimed, "assistance!  What to enable
you to run off with my daughter again?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," I replied; "the assistance I want is
not money."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," he said, surlily, "for you would not get it."</p>

<p>"I supposed as much," I said, "I knew that you were always
ready to receive money, and as I have got some to invest, I
want your advice in the matter."</p>

<p>"Don't think to deceive me by any of your romances, Pepper,"
said he, turning to his desk again. "I know you too well.
But how much money have you to invest, a quarter dollar?"</p>

<p>"I have ten thousand dollars," I replied, taking the roll of bills
from my pocket, "and would be glad to have the benefit of your
advice in investing it safely."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said old Gil, "why do you come here to annoy
me with such stories.  You can get nothing out of me by such
conduct.  You cannot impose upon me.  I know you, Pepper."</p>

<p>"You do not know me," I replied; "is there any deception in
these bills; look at them; are they not genuine?"  And I threw
them upon the desk of the old man, who started as he turned
them over, and summed up the value.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 162 -->

<p>"They are all genuine," said he; "but how did you obtain
them?"</p>

<p>"Honestly," I replied; "and I mean to use them honorably.
Will you keep them for me, until I can determine in what manner
to use them?"</p>

<p>Old Gil's countenance brightened up as he spoke, and he said:</p>

<p>"Certainly, Pepper, I will take care of the money for you.</p>

<p>"I never refuse money, Pepper," continued old Gil, as he
counted the notes which I handed him, and scrutinized them
closely, examining the texture of the paper, and looking at every
one separately by holding it up to the light. "I never refuse
money on deposit, because I can always operate with it to good
advantage.  But, you are sure, Pepper, that there is no mistake
about the bills?"</p>

<p>"I hope you do not doubt my word," said I, looking at him
indignantly; "for if you do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, no, not exactly that, Pepper," said he, putting the bills
into his desk and locking it; "but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me back my money," said I, "if you have any doubts
of my honesty."</p>

<p>"O, no, nothing of that sort," replied old Gil, "I can say
with truth, Pepper, that you never robbed me of anything, except
my daughter, and I believe you to be honest in money
matters."</p>

<p>"But you think me like a good many of your Wall street
friends, perhaps, honest in money matters, but dishonest in everything
else.  Is not that what you were going to say?" said I.</p>

<p>"Pepper, you have a very loose way of thinking about some
things, and I am afraid you have not had good religious instruction.
You deceived me once, you know, but I will overlook the
past; perhaps you will do better hereafter."</p>

<p>"I have done better," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you have done pretty well to get so much money,"
said he; "it is none of my business how you came by it, but I
hope, I mean I presume, you got it fairly and honestly.  I will

<!-- Volume II, page 163 -->

operate with it and give you half the profits; money is tight, and
I can buy some good paper at a large discount."</p>

<p>"I will take nothing but legal interest," said I; "I will not be
a party to any schemes for robbing people by taking advantage
of their necessities."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" exclaimed old Gil, "and yet you robbed me of
my daughter.  You talk about robbing!  Do you think money
is more valuable than a man's child?"</p>

<p>"If I do not," said I, "it appears that you do."</p>

<p>"I?" exclaimed the old fellow, scowling at me; "what do
you mean by that, sir; have I stolen anybody's child?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," I replied, "but you did worse, in bartering
your child for money."</p>

<p>The old fellow blushed a deep scarlet as I spoke, and the tobacco
juice dripped from each corner of his half-open mouth, upon
the corners of his dingy white cravat.  At last he recovered
himself, and exclaimed with passion, "it is false, it is no such
thing.  I never bartered away my child for money.  If you
mean Pauline, she never told you that I wished her to marry
Mr. Barton."</p>

<p>"She never did tell me so, it is true," I replied; "but she
understood your wishes, and was willing to sacrifice her own
happiness to please you."</p>

<p>"I have no objection to your thinking so," replied old Gil;
"my daughter is more dear to me than she can ever be to you;
let her do what she will, Pepper, she could never loosen the
cords which bind her to her father's heart.  Ah! you think
you love her, perhaps, and you may love her with the selfish
feeling of a man for his mistress.  But you would not love her
with undiminished affection if she were to abandon you as she
did me."</p>

<p>"But she would never abandon me," said I.</p>

<p>"Did you have this money when you ran off with Pauline?"
said he, as if desirous to change the subject.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "I was then almost penniless."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 164 -->

<p>"And now you have ten thousand dollars," said he, "it's a
large sum to gain in so short a time.  Tell me honestly, Pepper,
how you obtained it?"</p>

<p>"Honestly, then," I replied, "it was given to me by Mr.
Bassett."</p>

<p>"And why should he give you this large sum?" said the old
man, looking me steadily in the face, as though he were trying
to detect evidence of guilt in my looks.</p>

<p>"I know not, indeed; but he gave it to me without solicitation
on my part," I replied, "and appeared to do it willingly."</p>

<p>"It is a strange business," said he, "but I think I can guess
what it means."</p>

<p>"You were speaking about Pauline?" said I, anxious to hear
more about her.</p>

<p>"She is my child, Pepper, and I can neither hear any one
speak ill of her, nor name her faults myself.  She is my darling
daughter," said old Gil, wiping a tear from his eye, "and I
love her better than all the others.  I don't want her married.
You must not tempt her away from my house.  There is Lizzy;
why do you not fall in love with her; she is as good a girl as her
sister, if you must have one of my daughters? Lizzy writes
pretty poetry, and likes you as well as Pauline does, I dare say.
Come up and see her."</p>

<p>"I will go with pleasure," said I, "if you will allow me the
privilege."</p>

<p>"Allow you the privilege!" exclaimed old Gil; "of course I
will.  We are not afraid of you; my daughters will be glad to
see you.  Nancy is always talking about you, and Matilda said
the other day she would be happy to see you once more.  Come
up to-night.  You remember Judith, and my two youngest
daughters, Agnes and Maria, but they always call you
Grimshaw."</p>

<p>"I fear they have all imbibed a very bad opinion of me,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied old Gil, "they have not heard me or

<!-- Volume II, page 165 -->

their mother say any thing ill about you.  And there is Maria,
who has just returned from a visit to her aunt, who will be glad
to see you once more; come up, come up."</p>

<p>"I will come to-night," I replied, "but, make no allusion to
my Grimshaw freak, if you please.  It was one of the deceptions
which I was compelled, or at least thought I was compelled
to practice."</p>

<p>"Let it pass," said he, "and now about the money?   Shall I
give you my note for it?"</p>

<p>"No, there is no occasion for that," said I.</p>

<p>"There you are wrong," said old Gil; "there is occasion for
it.  Never trust to any man's honesty in matters of business.
The sum you have given me is too large not to have a voucher
for.  Here is my due bill for the sum.  I have business to
attend to now, Pepper, but I shall expect to see you at my house
to-night."</p>

<p>So he reached me his note for the money; and then thrusting
the papers which lay scattered before him into his hat, he left
his office, and I bade him good morning.</p>

<p>My reception by Pauline's father was so different from what
I had anticipated, that I felt more sure of Pauline than ever, and
had no fears now that I should not be able to triumph over
Mr. Barton.</p>

<p>As my wardrobe had been a good deal neglected, and my personal
appearance had not been much improved by my recent
vagabond way of life, I thought it advisable to do myself justice
in the matter of dress, and to pay a little more attention to my
external appearance than I had done for the past month or two.
I was neither vain of my personal appearance, nor particularly
fond of dress, but as I was now about to re-enter society once
more, and take my place among respectable people as the possessor
of ten thousand dollars, quite a fortune in those days, and
as the rival in love of a dashing bank-president, and as the prospective
heir of a baronetcy, and a large landed estate, I felt myself
bound to keep up appearances, and do credit to those who had

<!-- Volume II, page 166 -->

taken the pains to put me forward in the world.  While I was
in want and looking about town for employment, uncertain about
provision for to-morrow, and with no money in my pocket, I would
not be guilty of putting on false appearances by assuming a costly
style of dress as many do.  When I was poor I preferred being
thought poor, but now that I was rich, for the same reason I was
anxious not to be taken for a poor devil.</p>

<p>So, when I left old Gil's office, I went directly to a tailor's, who
had often solicited me to allow him the pleasure of making me a
suit of clothes, and procured an outfit adapted to my circumstances;
and being so well pleased with my altered looks in my
new attire, I was rather anxious for the evening to arrive that I
might make my appearance before Pauline, and enjoy her astonishment.</p>

<p>It was very clear that old Gil had no dislike to me, as he appeared
quite willing that I should run off with either of his dozen
daughters, except Pauline, who was the only one that I had
taken a liking to.</p>

<p>After being fully equipped in the latest fashions from head to
foot, and establishing myself in handsome apartments in a good
hotel on Broadway, I sauntered up and down that crowded
thoroughfare, impatiently waiting for the lamps to be lighted that
I might burst upon old Gil and his daughters on my
newly donned splendor.</p>

<p>As soon as my sense of propriety would permit, I was in front
of old Gil's tall brick house, and on pulling the door bell was immediately
admitted by the Irish servant, who exclaimed on seeing
me; "Heaven bless me! but it is Mr. Walter come back."</p>

<p>And before I could stop her, she ran into the parlor and exclaimed,
"here's Grimshaw come back again!"</p>

<p>I followed close behind her, and was welcomed at the parlor
door by Mrs. Gilson, who took my hand in a friendly manner,
and told me she was glad to see me once more. This friendly
greeting from the kind lady for whom I had always entertained
a very sincere regard, as she had been uniformly kind and considerate

<!-- Volume II, page 167 -->

to me, and seemed to love me because she thought that
I was her countryman, dissipated all the apprehensions I had felt
of not being well received, and gave me confidence to enter the
parlor boldly.</p>

<p>"Here is Grimshaw again," said old Gil, rising and reaching
me his hand; "but he is somewhat changed, children, not only
in his dress but in his name.  He is no longer Walter Grimshaw,
the friend, but our friend, Mr. Tom Pepper."</p>

<p>"Thomas, father," said Matilda, who rose and reached me her
hand.</p>

<p>"No, my daughter, not Thomas, but Tom.  You have heard
of Tom Pepper before, children."</p>

<p>"O yes," answered half a dozen small voices; "we have
heard about him, is Walter Tom Pepper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my children, this is Tom Pepper himself.  But you
must call him Mr. Pepper, until he gets another name.  But
where is Lizzy?" said old Gil.</p>

<p>"She will be down in a moment," replied Matilda.</p>

<p>"And where is Nancy?" said old Gil, for neither of the two
were present.</p>

<p>"And where is&mdash;&mdash;," I was going to add Pauline.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the old gentleman, "where is she, where is
she?  Where is Maria? and what has become of Judith.  Call
them down, my child;" he addressed himself to the little one sitting
on his knee whose name was Agnes.</p>

<p>"I did not mean them," said I, "I meant&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"O yes, I know," said old Gil, "you meant Caroline, but
Caroline is on a visit to her married sister in the next street."</p>

<p>"O, no, I did not," said I, "it was not Caroline that I meant."</p>

<p>"But here comes Lizzy," said the old patriarch, as the black
eyed and sedate girl entered the room, followed by her dumpy
sister Nancy, "and there is Nancy too.  My daughter, here is
Grimshaw come back to see you all, but with a new name.  But
he is your friend the same as ever."

<p>"I am sure we shall be too happy to see out old friend back

<!-- Volume II, page 168 -->

again," said Lizzy, reaching me her hand, "to find fault with a
change of name."</p>

<p>Nancy merely curtsied to me, for she was the Cinderella of
the family, and either preferred retirement, or was forced into it
by her more showy sisters, and never ventured to say anything.
The old fellow was determined that I should say nothing about
Pauline, for whenever I attempted to speak her name, he would
say something in reference to one of his other daughters.  But
as my object in paying him a visit was expressly to have an interview
with Pauline, I made another attempt to inquire after her,
who was the only missing member of the family.</p>

<p>"It is a great pleasure to me," I remarked, addressing Mrs.
Gilson, who had resumed her rocking-chair, "to see you all once
more, looking so happy and cheerful; but there is one member
of your happy-looking family missing, whose presence would add
to my pleasure."<p>

<p>"Caroline?" said Mrs. Gilson as she caught a glance from the
eye of her husband, who was looking intently at us.</p>

<p>"No, not Caroline," I replied, "but Pauline?  Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"O! Pauline!" said Mrs. Gilson with evident embarrassment,
"Pauline is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pauline is engaged;" said old Gil, gruffly, suddenly interrupting.
"She is engaged, Pepper!"</p>

<p>"Who is sister Pauline engaged to, Mr. Barton?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"Put this child to bed," said her father, taking her in
his arms and placing her in the hall; "I am surprised, my
dear, that you allow the little ones to be in the parlor when there
is company here."</p>

<p>Little Agnes was not disposed of without some pretty loud
demonstrations of opposition on the part of that young lady, which
had the effect of creating a good deal of confusion in the parlor.
But I was determined upon knowing something positive about
Pauline; so when composure had been restored in the family
group, I asked again what had become of Pauline.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 169 -->

<p>"Pauline, Pepper," said old Gil gravely, "cannot be seen
for the present.  I will explain to you by-and-by the cause of
her absence."</p>

<p>There was an evident feeling of restraint among the girls, occasioned
by my enquiring for Pauline, which they made awkward
attempts to disguise, old Gil was fidgety, his quiet wife had an
uneasy look, and Nancy was silently engaged in attempting a
Cinderella-like task of unravelling some skeins of silk, while
Lizzy appeared to be busily engaged in looking for a particular
passage of a favorite author, which she held upside down. For
myself I sat silent and morose, intending to take my leave at once
when a fortunate pull of the door bell, and the entrance of a
stranger happily caused a diversion of thought into another channel,
and relieved us of our embarrassment.  The gentleman who
came in I had never seen before, but he appeared to be quite at
home among the Gilsons, and smiled grimly upon them in a
manner which might have been construed into a declaration of defiance
rather than a friendly greeting.  His visage was very
thin and pale, his nose high and sharp, his hair long, black, and
glossy like an Indian's.  There was an attempt at gentility in
his dress, strangely at variance with his manners; as I glanced
at his dubious figure and expression, I thought to myself, he
must be either a priest turned into a soldier, or a soldier turning
into a priest.  But first impressions in respect to individuals are
generally erroneous.  He was neither one nor the other.</p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce you to the Rev. Job Headless, the
celebrated Author," said old Gil; "Mr. Headless, this is our
young friend Mr. Tom Pepper, of whom you have heard my
daughters speak."</p>

<p>Why, Pepper, how are you?" exclaimed the Reverend and
celebrated gentleman as he squeezed my hand with his long wiry
fingers, and almost tore it from my wrist.  "I am delighted to
see you.  I don't know of anybody I would have preferred seeing."</p>

<p>I could do no less than thank Mr. Headless for his friendly expressions,

<!-- Volume II, page 170 -->

but I was a good deal surprised at his familiarity, and
not particularly impressed in his favor.  Without having the
least fear of him, I could not help experiencing an uncomfortable
sensation of his being about to strike me.</p>

<p>"What is there new in literature?" inquired old Gil; "have
you got any new works out since you were here last?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly out," replied Mr. Headless, "I thought of a
perfectly splendid history yesterday, which I commenced this
morning, and I think I shall have it ready for the press by the
end of the week."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Lizzy, who was always alive to hear
anything new in literature.  "Pray what is it?  Do let me
know all about it before it comes out in the papers.  What is it
about?"</p>

<p>"I think of calling it the Bloody Battle of Bunker Hill, or
Warren and his Warriors," said the author.</p>

<p>"What an admirable title," said Lizzy, shutting up her
book.  "How impatient I am for the work."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will be profitable?" asked her Father; "will
it pay you as well as your other works?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to pay," said Mr. Headless, "I am sure of ten
thousand dollars which have been guaranteed to me by my publishers;
but I shall probably get much better terms, as I have had
offers from half a dozen rival booksellers, who have got up
a public controversy about my work, which will make it sell with
a perfect looseness."</p>

<p>Old Gil intimated to the popular author that if he had "anything
over" when he made a settlement with his publishers, that
he, old Gil, knew of an operation by which it might be employed
to good advantage.  The author replied that he intended
"shaving some notes" for a friend as soon as he could get his
money, and hoped to make a beautiful operation by it, as the
money market was tight.</p>

<p>"O! Mr. Headless," said Lizzy, "you might read us some of
your new work; do now."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 171 -->

<p>"I didn't come out for that purpose," replied the author, putting
his hands in his pocket and pulling out a small package of brown
paper, "but I have just received a revise of my first chapter
from the printer, and I will read you a part of it."</p>

<p>"O! you are such an obliging creature," exclaimed Lizzy.</p>

<p>The author drew up to the centre-table, and spreading his
dingy proof sheets before him began to read, while old Gil and
his daughters drew around and listened with rapt attention, to
the following commencement of the new historical work which
was so soon to throw the whole country into convulsions.</p>

<p>"I have long thought," began the author, "that a well written
history of the celebrated battle of Bunker's Hill was much needed
by the readers of this country."</p>

<p>"I should think," said old Gil, "it was no more needed than
a fourth of July Oration, for I had an idea that everybody knew
as much about it as they could desire."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said the reverend author with a sarcastic smile,
"you may be in the habit of doing things without giving a reason
for it; but it would hardly do to write a history of an event
which everybody knows as well as yourself, without pretending
to believe it called for at least."</p>

<p>"O, if you put it on that ground I have no more to say about
it," replied old Gil, "but you recollect you write that you have
long thought of this thing, while you told me just now that you
thought about it for the first time yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," said the author with another sneer, "where's the
inconsistency in that?  One day is a long time to me.  But, do
let me proceed."</p>

<p>"Go on, then;" said old Gil; and the author proceeded in
the reading of the first chapter of his work as follows:</p>

<p>"I have long thought that a well written history of the celebrated
Battle of Bunker Hill was much needed by the readers
of this country, and have, therefore, concluded to supply the
desideratum which has been so long felt.  The iron hearted men
of the revolution having resolved to break the galling shackles

<!-- Volume II, page 172 -->

of that scourge of the material universe, the British monarchy,
assembled together on the lofty heights of Bunker's Hill on the
27th of June, 1775."</p>

<p>"Was it not the 17th?" said Lizzy.</p>

<p>"Not according to my authorities," replied Mr. Headless;
"but a few days matters nothing.</p>

<p>"It was one of the finest days of the season.  God himself
seemed to smile upon the efforts of these iron hearted men to
free themselves from the yoke of the tyrants, by arraying the
Heavens in their brightest blue."</p>

<p>"But it appears to me that such a mark of divine sanction as
that, was as good for one side as the other," remarked old Gil.&mdash;The
author did not heed the criticism, but went on with his reading.</p>

<p>"The sun rose gloriously from his bed in the ocean, and
lighted up with his brilliant fires the rocky heights of Bunker's
famed Hill.  The high souled and gallant Warren, mounted on
a coal black charger, stood upon the brow of the loftiest eminence
with the stars and stripes of his country's flag waving proudly
above his head.  An immense eagle with outspread wings, was
seen hovering in the air, and after circling around his head,
alighted upon his burnished helmet and seemed to fondle him
with his coal black wings.  The immense army which lined the
side of that rocky steep, and stretched far away over the woody
heights of Dorchester, until its serried ranks were lost on the
shores of Buzzard's Bay, saw the omen and hailed it with a shout
that made the heart of Sir Ralph Abercrombie and his army
of British myrmidons quail with terror.  Shortly after this, the
battle begun by a movement of Prescott, who, by a successful
man&oelig;uvre succeeded in drawing towards him a battalion under
the command of General Howe.  Simultaneously with this movement
the whole British fleet, to the number of forty-seven three-deckers,
twenty-one frigates, three sloops, and two ships of the
line, which lay at anchor in Massachusetts Bay, began a heavy
cannonade on our brave troops with the most perfect looseness conceivable.

<!-- Volume II, page 173 -->

A perfect torrent of red hot shot was now pouring
down upon the heads of our brave countrymen, who received
the overpowering and tremendously destructive charge without
moving an inch or losing a single soul.  The British army having
landed at Charlestown Neck under cover of the batteries of
their ships, were advancing with the most perfect lightning like
rapidity up the step declivities of the hill, when Warren putting
spurs to his gallant charger, called out in his trumpet-toned voice,
"God and the Continental Congress," and dashing at a fearful
speed down the precipitous sides of the hill, was followed in his
irresistible force by Putnam and his light horse, Stark and his
dragoons, Wayne and his riflemen, and Green with his heavy
artillery.  The earth trembled as they advanced, the clouds of
dust raised by the tramping of the feet of the chargers created
such an impenetrable cloud above their heads, that although
the sun was shining brightly in the pure azure above that blood
stained battle field, it was darker than Egypt, and the two armies
came together with a most tremendous concussion before they
knew they were in the presence of each other.</p>

<p>The real work of that memorable battle now commenced in
earnest.  Warren darted with hot haste into the midst of the
Tory ranks, and unsheathing his sword began to wield it about the
head of the flower of the British aristocracy with such perfect impetuosity
that he found himself in a sea of human gore while
whole heaps of carcasses lay piled up around him in the most
frightful disorder.  The thunders of the marine batteries were
still kept up with unceasing vigor, while the flashes of the sabres
and the explosions of the muskets, mingled with the sounds of
the fifes and drums, the groans of the dying and wounded, and
the whistling of the bullets, as they flew over the heads of that
devoted band of patriot warriors, made one of the most frightful
pictures of war's doings that could possibly be conceived.  Torrents
of blood were pouring down the sides of the hill, and a
perfect hail storm of bomb shells were exploding in every
direction, when the noble charge of the brave Warren was seen

<!-- Volume II, page 174 -->

to rear upon his hind legs, and uttering that famous shriek
which the horses of warriors always utter just before breathing
their last on the field of battle, he fell, and his rider found
himself on his feet alone, and in front of a squadron of cavalry.
Throwing away the scabbard of his sword, and looking proudly
at the infuriate enemy, the hero of the day commanded them to
surrender.  Struck by the noble bearing of the hero, the leader
of the band without being altogether aware of what he was doing,
tendered his sword to the indomitable leader of Freedom's first
champion,&mdash;&mdash;That is as far as I have written at present," said the
author, rolling up the leaves from which he had been reading.
"But you will see the style of the work."</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," exclaimed Lizzy, "don't you think so, Mr.
Pepper?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I think it beautiful," I replied.</p>

<p>"But you will confess it is very powerfully written?" said she.</p>

<p>"Why, as to the power of such writing," I replied, "it must
depend very much upon the feelings of the reader.  There is
certainly the power of reckless extravagance in it; and the
power of misrepresentation, exercised to an extent I have never
known surpassed.  If it be any proof of power to violate history,
to disregard all grammatical rules, to exaggerate scenes of carnage,
and dwell with a morbid gusto upon revolting subjects,
why then it is powerful; but then it is a kind of power which
should be suppressed at once, instead of encouraged."</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest, Sir?" exclaimed the author, jumping
from his seat and grinning in a frightful manner at me.  "I
demand if you are in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is my opinion," said I.  "Why should you doubt
it.  Are you in the habit of staying what you do not think?"</p>

<p>"You are offensive to me," replied Mr. Headless.  "I despise
you.  I always heard you were a rascal, and now I know it.&mdash;As
for thinking anything about what you say, or caring for your
opinions of my works, of course, I don't.  Such an ignoramus
as you, can say nothing, nor do nothing to injure my reputation.

<!-- Volume II, page 175 -->

I have done more towards the literature of this country, than you
could if you should live forever."</p>

<p>"Don't get excited, Sir." said old Gil, while his wife and
Lizzy held their breath in alarm.</p>

<p>"Excited!  Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the author; "excited,
indeed.  I am perfectly free from any thing of the sort.
But let me assure you, sir," and he grinned at me ferociously
while he spoke, and trembled as though he would fall to pieces,
"let me assure you, sir, I will have my revenge out of you, Mr.
Pepper.  No man insults me with impunity.  I will have satisfaction
out of you if it costs me my life."  Then turning to
Lizzy and her Mother he said: "good evening ladies," and
made his exit, slamming the door as he went out.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, this has happened," said Lizzy, "he is
such a dreadfully revengeful person."</p>

<p>"So am I," said her father; "I expected to make a good thing
by operating with some of the money from the sale of his book."</p>

<p>"I too am sorry," said I, "since it is likely to cause you
any inconvenience; but I care nothing for the gentleman's anger
myself."</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't know him as well as we do," said Lizzy;
"he regards everybody as a personal enemy who does not read
and admire his books; and he is always as good as his word,
when he threatens to be revenged upon anybody for disapproving
of them.  But you must be on your guard against him."</p>

<p>"It was not very polite, Pepper," said old Gil, "to tell him
so plainly what you thought of his writings."</p>

<p>"And then," added Lizzy, "your opinions are so different from
the public judgement; for his works are very much read and
very much admired.  I do not much wonder at his feeling touched
by your remarks."</p>

<p>"Besides, Pepper," continued old Gil, "books that sell well
must be good; and if Mr. Headless finds that the public like to
read his books, I think he is all right to keep on making them as
fast as he can, and getting all the money by them he can."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 176 -->

<p>"As to his right to do that it is just the same that every man
possesses who has no scruples of conscience about doing wrong
when he finds it profitable;" said I.  "Every species of vice
and villainy may be justified in the same way.  Those who live
by pandering to the ignorance of the ignorant, or the vices of
the vicious, who justify themselves by the countenance of the
public may all be deemed innocent of moral wrong upon the
same plea.  The retailer of obscene prints, the writer of vile
books, the dealer in unhealthy food, the gambler, the publican,
the usurer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all very true," said old Gil, interrupting me; "I
don't pretend to deny it; but surely, Pepper, you don't class
usury, with the other forms of wickedness which you alluded
to?  Because I must beg leave to differ with you."</p>

<p>"Usury," I replied, "why I look upon usury as one of the
greatest curses to society, growing out of our modern institutions;
it makes two thirds of the community slaved to the other
third; it creates an aristocracy of the most odious character,
exempting men from all the responsibilities of labor, and giving
them a claim upon the earnings of the poor and needy, more exacting
and pitiless than any ever exercised by a despotic monarch.
The usurer, sir, I regard as a&mdash;&mdash; "</p>

<p>"You do not regard me in that light, of course, Pepper?"
said old Gil, interrupting me; "you do not mean to insinuate
that my business is that of a usurer?&mdash;because, I never
take anything more in an operation than my customers are willing to
pay; and they know, of course, what money is worth to them.
Besides, Pepper, we must all live&mdash;some by one means, and some
by another.  It is my business to negotiate notes, and help merchants
out of their difficulties when they get in a tight place.
It will never do to be too particular in these things; the law,
Pepper, is the safest guide to follow; and the law protects me in
my calling, which, as Saint Paul advises, I endeavor to make
sure.  This is no more than the Christian duty of every good
citizen, and as the Lord has blessed me with a large family I

<!-- Volume II, page 177 -->

must not seem ungrateful for the blessing by neglecting to provide
for them.</p>

<p>"But, I forgot that I invited Mr. Headless here this evening to
unite with us in our family worship.  As the hour for our devotion
has arrived, Pepper, you will not refuse to join us in supplicating
the Throne of Grace?"</p>

<p>"O, no," said I, "there can be no harm in it."</p>

<p>"Come, Lizzy, my daughter, you shall read us a chapter
from the Bible, first," said the old man.</p>

<p>The Bible was placed upon the centre table by one of the
young children, and Lizzy read a chapter from the acts of the
apostles, which, either by accident, or design, happened to contain
the narrative of the death of Ananias and Sapphira.  Lizzy
had a very sweet voice and read in a very pretty and devout
manner, but there was a little manner of affectation in her emphasis
which her sister Pauline was quite free from.  Pauline,
in truth, had the happy faculty of doing every thing well because
she seemed to do every thing without being conscious of
an effort, and by an appearance of impulse.  After the reading
of the chapter all the family joined in singing a hymn, and, at
the close of these devotional exercises, old Gil knelt down and
addressed the Throne of Grace, in a very orthodox and business-like
manner.  The pronouncing the <i>Amen</i> was a signal to go to
bed, and all the girls, having given their father a kiss, and been
kissed by him in return, retired with their mother and left us
sitting together.</p>

<p>Old Gil seemed disposed to enter into conversation with me,
and after making two or three attempts, he began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have always liked you, Pepper, from the first time you
came into my office, and asked for employment, and although
appearances at one time were so much against your character, I
now believe that you are really honest, and mean to do well.&mdash;But,
you have got a bad name, Pepper; it won't go down in Wall
street; and a man whose name is not good in Wall street, is
hardly a suitable match for my daughter.  But, notwithstanding

<!-- Volume II, page 178 -->

all that, Pepper, I would not oppose your becoming a member of
my family, provided you wanted to marry either of my daughters,
excepting only Pauline."</p>

<p>"But why object to my marrying Pauline," said I, "when it
is Pauline who alone is willing to marry me?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure of that, Pepper," said old Gil; "perhaps you
have never asked either of the others."

<p>"To put an end at once to any expectations of my doing so,"
I replied, "I solemnly protest to you, that nothing on earth could
induce me to marry either of them."</p>

<p>This candid declaration seemed to startle old Gil from a comfortable
position into which his thoughts had settled, for he received
it with a frown and said&mdash;"Very well, then; you must
make up your mind, sir, not to become a member of my family, for
Pauline has other engagements.  Good night to you, sir; the
chamber-maid will show you to your room."  So saying he
walked off and left me.  It was near midnight, and soon after I
went up to the little room in the third story of the house which
had been appropriated for my use.  I was a good deal vexed at
the abrupt termination of my interview with old Gil, for I had
determined to find out something in respect to Pauline.  But it
was too late now to seek for further intelligence of her, and I
concluded that she had been sent off to some remote place in the
country where it would be useless to attempt to follow her; and
being free from any oppressive cares, or guilty remembrances
I soon fell asleep and was lost to Pauline and all the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p>I WAS sleeping very soundly, and lying quite as unconscious of
existence as the pillow beneath my head, when a slight noise at
my chamber door aroused me.  I had forgotten to lock the door,
and jumped from the bed and turned the key.  Thinking that I
had been mistaken in supposing that some one had been trying to

<!-- Volume II, page 179 -->

open the door I jumped into bed again and was just sinking
once more into a sound slumber when the same noise again
aroused me.  I was now persuaded that there was a thief in the
house, and was just upon the point of giving an alarm, when
somebody whispered through the key hole, "Walter!"  The
voice was familiar to me, but now being fully awake I did not recognize
it until it whispered again, "Walter, it is I.  Hush, don't
make a noise."</p>

<p>I had no light, and as the room was darkened by outside
shutters, it was a good while before I could find my clothes, and
groping about for them I made a terrible clatter by upsetting the
wash stand.  Then for fear of creating an alarm I was obliged
to remain very quiet again; and I did not venture until some
minutes had elapsed, to whisper through the key hole and tell
Pauline that I heard her, and beg her to wait patiently until I
could put on my clothes.</p>

<p>As ill luck would have it, my boots were new and tight, and
after I had pulled them on, they creaked so loudly as I walked
across the floor, that I was compelled to pull them off again.&mdash;Pauline
was impatient and whispered through the key hole
again, "be quick, dear Walter, or we shall be discovered."</p>

<p>Another difficulty now beset me; I had completed my dress,
and, with my boots in my hand was just going to open the door,
when I found it impossible to turn the key.  The sweat started
from every pore of my flesh, as I encountered this new difficulty,
and my trepidation was not at all lessened by Pauline again
calling in her sweet voice to hasten, or she would be detected.&mdash;After
trying to turn the obstinate key for nearly half an hour, in
my desperation I took hold of the handle of the door to attempt
to wrest it off, and to my unspeakable joy, discovered that it had
all the time been unlocked; in my agitation I did not discover
that I had turned the key.</p>

<p>No sooner was the door opened than Pauline threw herself into
my arms, and I pressed her to my heart with rapturous delight.</p>

<p>"Dear Walter," said she, softly, "we must not delay; it is

<!-- Volume II, page 180 -->

near morning, and if my sister should wake and miss me I shall
be lost."</p>

<p>Putting my arm around her waist, partly to support her, for
she trembled violently, and partly that she might guide me I followed
her along the narrow passage until we reached the head of
the stairs when my foot slipped, and we both came near tumbling
to the foot of the stairs; but by the self-possession of Pauline,
who held me back, we were saved.  Fortunately for us,
the bed-room of old Gil was on the second floor at the back of
the house, so that the noise of the creaking stairs as we descended
did not awake him.  As he was in the habit of sleeping with
a loaded revolver near his pillow, for old Gil had a terrible dread
of thieves, he might have put a bullet into our backs if he had
heard us as we were attempting to escape.</p>

<p>We at last reached the foot of the stairs, and again were embarrassed
by the fastenings of the front door, which I succeeded
in removing, after considerable difficulty, and once more found
myself upon the side-walk, with Pauline leaning upon me for
support.  Stopping only long enough to pull on my boots, I
seized Pauline by the arm, and ran briskly down the street until
we were far enough from her father's house to elude pursuit,
when I stopped again to take breath, for Pauline was dreadfully
agitated, and her little heart beat violently as though it would
burst by knocking itself against her waist.  The darling girl had
not ventured to open her lips since we came into the street, lest
she should be overheard, but now that she was assured of being
at a safe distance she began to weep violently, and I found it a
difficult matter to soothe her.</p>

<p>"Dear Pauline," said I; "you are weeping from regret at
the step you have taken.  I  will carry you back to your father's
house, and he will never know that you left it with me."</p>

<p>"No, no, no," said she; "I would not return for the world.
No, no, no; I regret nothing.  I am very foolish for weeping, but
I cannot help it. Surely, I have no cause to weep, for I am very,
very happy Walter."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 181 -->

<p>"Then we will be happy, darling Pauline;" I exclaimed,
pressing her again to my heart; "I am now in very different
circumstances from what I was when I parted with you last.  I
am now rich, Pauline.  I have got ten thousand dollars of my
own, and we will leave the city that we may be free from further
pursuit or difficulty until we can be married and safe
from ever being parted again."</p>

<p>I was curious to learn from Pauline how she knew that I was
in her father's house, and also the cause of her non-appearance
in the parlor with the rest of the family.</p>

<p>"Dear Walter," said she, "my father has his own reasons for
not consenting to my marriage.  What they are I have not given
myself the trouble to enquire, for it is enough for me to know
that he opposes our union."</p>

<p>"Dearest Pauline," said I, "do you not know it is because he
wants you to marry that rich bank-president, Mr. Barton, that he
may thereby increase his bank facilities, and be able to shave
more notes than he can now?"</p>

<p>"O, no, dear Walter, it is not that," said she, "for he knows
that I never will consent to marry Mr. Barton. I was indifferent
to him at first, but when he made proposals to me I hated him
with all my heart, and since then I have learned to despise him.
This my father knows, and he knows, too, that I will never
yield, although he should command me to marry him, which he
will not do, for I think he loves me too well.  But he is more
anxious to prevent our marriage than he is that I should be married
to Mr. Barton.  The reason of his opposition to you he will
neither tell me nor my mother; and as I said before I care
nothing about his reasons, yet I love my father, Walter, better
than any other person but you.  Since my return home from
the last unfortunate attempt on our part to be married, I have not
been allowed to leave my room alone, and as I refused to leave it
unless allowed the liberty of going where I liked, without
being watched, I refused to leave it at all; so that I have,
dear Walter, been a voluntary prisoner, and not by force.  I

<!-- Volume II, page 182 -->

did not know that you were in the house until my sister Lizzy,
who slept in the same room with me, told me, when she came to
bed.  I learned from her, too, that you were going to remain all
night and sleep in the same room that you had before occupied.
I only waited for Lizzy to fall asleep, when I crept out of bed,
and having dressed myself without disturbing her, I had no
difficulty in reaching your room.  You thought me very bold,
did you not, Walter?"</p>

<p>"I thought you very generous and true hearted," I replied,
"to risk your good name by such an act, and I loved you the
better for it."</p>

<p>"And you did not think me bold?" said she.</p>

<p>"It was a bold act," I replied, "and had it not been you, Pauline,
I might have condemned it."</p>

<p>"Ha!  Walter, you blamed me for it?" said she.</p>

<p>"Not precisely blame," replied I, "but, I cannot help thinking,
Pauline, that I should probably have condemned the act if
the visit had not been paid to myself."</p>

<p>"Then you blame me?" she said pettishly.</p>

<p>"Blame you! no, Pauline; I can never blame you let you
do what you will," I replied.</p>

<p>"But, if you would condemn in another what I have done,
you must think I have done wrong.  Dear Walter, tell me truly,
for you love to speak your thoughts; do you not think I have
been too forward?"

<p>"Truly, then, Pauline," said I, "as tenderly as I love you, I
cannot be blind to your failings, and I do think that you have
been too rash for your reputation, but as I know the purity of your
motives, I do not love you the less for it; yet, as you are to be
my wife, Pauline, I should prefer that even slander could find
nothing in your conduct to found a report upon."</p>

<p>"Ah, Walter, you do not love me then, as I thought you did,
or you would see nothing in me to condemn," said Pauline, as
her hand suddenly relaxed its pressure upon my arm.</p>

<p>"Fie, fie, Pauline, don't let us quarrel so soon," said I; "it is

<!-- Volume II, page 183 -->

beginning to grow light, and we must hasten to a steamboat landing
that we may get out of the city before your absence is discovered."</p>

<p>But Pauline did not quicken her steps as I urged her forward.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Walter, once more, that you love me, and I shall be
satisfied," said she.</p>

<p>"If you doubt it, my saying so would not convince you.  Let
me take you back to your father's house, if you are not satisfied
of my devotion to you," said I.</p>

<p>"O, no, I do not doubt you; but why not tell me that you
love me, if you do?" said she.</p>

<p>"Simply, Pauline, because you and I ought not to be making
protestations to each other, as though we were strangers, and
knew nothing of each other's feelings.  If my past conduct has
not satisfied you of my love for you, no protestations that I
could make would do so.  We are too old friends, Pauline, to
be complimenting each other."</p>

<p>"Friends!" said she.</p>

<p>It was a clear case that Pauline was jealous, or skeptical in
respect to my protestations; or capricious; or disposed to test the
strength of my regard for her.  As the thought flashed upon me
that she might be of that exacting disposition, the unhappy effects
of which I had so often witnessed in the case of Mrs. Bassett, I
felt a misgiving that Pauline was not calculated to make me happy
as a husband.  If she could tantalize me at such a time by her
unreasonable suspicions of my fidelity, or affection, what might
I not anticipate as her husband, when she would have a prescriptive
right to torment me?  In addition to these unlucky thoughts,
I remembered what Mr. Bassett had said about her leaving her
father with so little compunction, and her trifling with Mr.
Barton; and I began to think that I was acting in a rather
hasty manner, and putting my future happiness at stake in a
very desperate adventure.  To confess the truth, I actually
wished myself asleep in old Gil's house, and Pauline back again,
under the protection of his roof.  Added to these reflections came

<!-- Volume II, page 184 -->

the thought of my baseness in repaying the hospitality of the old
man, by running off with his daughter, and subjecting myself to
the charge of duplicity towards him.  It was but just beginning
to grow light in the east; the street lamps were burning dimly;
here and there we met a laborer going to his work; and now and
then the rumble of a cart was heard, giving indications that morning
was near at hand, and the city on the point of waking up.&mdash;There
was a probability of our being able to return to the house,
and each of us going back to our chamber without our absence
being discovered.  Therefore, I said to Pauline; "Let us not
act rashly, nor be guilty of any act now, that will be a cause of
unhappiness hereafter.  If you doubted my love, Pauline, it will
be better for us both that you should test it before taking the step that
cannot be retraced."</p>

<p>"Let this be the test then, Walter, that you say nothing about
returning to my father's.  Go on, and I will follow you."  And
she clung to my arm again as though she were fearful that I
would abandon her.</p>

<p>But I was far from being convinced of Pauline's freedom from
that womanly capriciousness which is so tormenting to the object
she dotes upon, and which shows itself in acts of tyranny that
makes fools of the wisest men.  I could not help thinking of Mr.
Bassett's caution to me respecting Pauline, caused, no doubt
by his own uncomfortable experiences with his wife, who was once,
as loving, as trusting, and as yielding as Pauline now appeared.
I could not endure the thought of being forced to act the part of
a master towards my wife, and to save myself from being a slave
by making a slave of her; and it was still more repulsive to me to
contemplate being the husband of a woman towards whom I should
be compelled to make use of deceptions to preserve her good
nature.  I had thought that Pauline was so entirely devoted to
me, so confident of my love for her, and so convinced of my
integrity, that, under every trial and in all circumstances she
would require no other evidence of my devotion to her than such
as my conduct would offer, let it be what it might.  But this

<!-- Volume II, page 185 -->

little exhibition of petulance which she had just made, and without
any apparent cause, too, had excited doubts in my mind and
made me loth to precipitate our marriage.  But there was no
help for me.  She had thrown herself upon me, and had been induced
to do so by my own protestations of love for her, and it
was now too late to eject her.  She had not changed, certainly;
she was the same tender, beautiful, and confiding creature, that
she ever was, and showed the same willingness that she had
ever done to abandon everybody and every thing for my sake;
but then, she exacted everything from me in return.  I could
not but acknowledge to myself that I was no less exacting, on
my part, and so I persuaded myself that it was I who was growing
jealous, and not Pauline.  In conformity with a determination
to deal with everybody in a perfectly frank manner, it was
my duty to tell Pauline exactly the state of my feelings, and
what suspicious thoughts had been passing through my mind; and
I meant to do so, but I could not then take the necessary time to
explain myself in full, for we were hurrying rapidly along the
streets, and I thought it would be a good subject for discussion
after our marriage, at some time when we might possibly
be at a loss for a topic, when I would give her a pleasant little surprise
by confessing that I had once been so silly as to doubt her
love for me.  All these thoughts passed very rapidly through
my mind, and they should have passed out of my mouth, but I
was too happy to be rid of such annoying visitors, and so dismissed
them by a shorter method.  I forgot them altogether, for
the time, but they came back again and caused me more trouble
at another day.</p>

<p>Pauline had an old boarding-school companion who was married
to a young merchant in Philadelphia, for whom she had a
romantic attachment, and as it was quite a matter of indifference
to me whither we went, for Mr. Bassett had relieved me from the
obligation to inform him of my intended movements, I readily
agreed to Pauline's wish to go to Philadelphia, and after consummating
our desires by getting married, to make a bridal visit

<!-- Volume II, page 186 -->

to her friend, who, Pauline said, would be overjoyed to entertain
us.  As we had still considerable distance to walk before we
should reach the steamboat dock, it was getting to be alarmingly
light in the streets, and the increasing carriages and passengers
gave us a good deal of uneasiness lest we should be recognized
by some of her father's friends.  We had no baggage, but Pauline
had taken the precaution to compress a few womanly necessaries
into her work-bag which she carried on her arm, and as I
had not yet encumbered myself with any unnecessary wardrobe,
we had all our worldly wealth with us.  I felt very easy in respect
to money matters, as they say in Wall street, for I had
taken the precaution, the day before, to draw on old Gil for five
hundred dollars, which I had put into my pocket-wallet in small
bills, so I had nothing to fear on the score of pecuniary resources,
and I promised Pauline that she should have a becoming bride's
dress as soon as we got to Philadelphia.  We reached the steamboat
landing at a very suspiciously early hour, just as they were
lighting up the fires under the boilers of the steamboat, and as
we walked on board were eyed very closely by the people about
the boat, who winked at each other and seemed to guess that we
were on a run-away excursion.  I took Pauline into be ladies'
cabin, and in avoid any further remarks, threw myself upon a
sofa in another part of the saloon, where I fell asleep, much to my
mortification.  Pauline in the meantime sat watching the entrance
of the cabin with her veil closely drawn, and scrutinized everybody
that came in.  By-and-by she came and woke me and told
me that I might get up, as the boat was off and there was nobody
on board who knew her.</p>

<p>Pauline took my arm and we walked out upon the promenade
deck to snuff up the fresh breeze of the bay, which had an exhilarating
effect upon our spirits, and Pauline begun to dance and
laugh with great glee as she looked back and saw the towers and
steeples of the city growing dim in the distance.</p>

<p>"Dear Walter," said she, looking fondly up in my face, "there
is nothing now that can hinder our marriage.  I am so happy,

<!-- Volume II, page 187 -->

I could dance for joy.  And how delighted my dear friend Sophia
will be to see me; she knows all about you, Walter, and
has written me that she loves you almost as much as I do, only
from what I have told her about you.  But she will be so surprised
when she finds that we have run away to get married!  It
will be such a treat to enjoy her astonishment.  Shall we be
married to-night, Walter, or to-morrow?  O! let it be to-morrow,
but early.  And then I will not call you Walter any more,
but Tom, for you cannot be married by false names.  And think
how funny it will be to make my initials P. P., Pauline Pepper.
Well, I think it is a beautiful name, after all.  But will you
forgive me if I say that I like Walter better, Tom, because that
was the name by which I knew you first.  Well, I will call you
Tom, but I shall always think of you as Walter.  But, what shall
I say to Sophia; for I have always called you Walter when I
have spoken to her about you?  Shall I say that you are a new
lover, or an old one with a new name?  Shall I say that it was
I who invented the name of Walter or you?"</p>

<p>She was running on in this strain, chirruping and skipping,
when she suddenly stopped and exclaimed, "O! Walter!"</p>

<p>As I was looking in her face at the time, I only saw it turn
pale, without discovering the cause which had so suddenly affected
her.</p>

<p>I caught her in my arms as she was on the point of falling,
and supposing that she had fainted from the excitement she had
been laboring under all the morning, I was about to convey her
into the saloon, when, raising my eyes, I was startled at seeing
Mr. Barton standing near us and gazing earnestly at her.  But
I recovered myself immediately, and without seeming to regard
the bank-president, I kissed Pauline, and, whispering in her ear,
told her not to allow the presence of Mr. Barton to annoy her,
as he had no power or right to interfere with us.  She could not
rally her spirits at once, and I was rather mortified that she
should manifest so much feeling at encountering a person whom
I had reason to believe she so heartily despised.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 188 -->

<p>"Don't allow him to imagine, Pauline, that you care anything
for him," said I; "but let us keep on our walk on the promenade
deck."</p>

<p>But she was so agitated that she could not speak, and it was
not very easy for me to keep her from reeling as we walked
across the deck.  Mr. Barton retired a short distance, and, without
seeming to regard me, was evidently endeavoring to catch
Pauline's eye; she turned her head from him, however, and
letting her veil fall, screened her face from his observation.
Feeling myself insulted by his pertinacity in attempting to annoy
Pauline when she was under my protection, I placed her upon a
settee, and approaching Mr. Barton, said to him, "Sir, you will
oblige me by not looking at the lady under my charge."</p>

<p>"Why not, sir?" said Mr. Barton, in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>"Because, sir," I replied, "it is annoying to her.  That
should be a sufficient reason for a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I shall do as I please, sir;" he answered, retreating.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, you will expect me to do the same," I said,
shaking my finger at him, "and if it pleases you to annoy her
in that, or in any other manner, it will please me to pull your
wig off and throw it in your face."</p>

<p>Mr. Barton trembled violently, and turned pale as I spoke,
and muttering something about my insolence, he turned and left
me.  Pauline had overheard our conversation, and was terribly
frightened, but I told her not to be alarmed, for we were safe
from Mr. Barton's malice, and that he could not annoy us on our
arrival in Philadelphia, as I had plenty of money, and we could
continue our journey farther South, if it should be necessary to
avoid him; his meeting us was evidently accidental, for I knew
that he was in the habit of making visits to Philadelphia on business
connected with his bank.  Soon after this the breakfast bell
rang, and we followed the crowd down into the cabin and took
our seats at the table, which, as usual, was overloaded with hearty
food.  The morning air, and the exercise I had taken, had given
me a keen appetite, which I was proceeding to satisfy with an

<!-- Volume II, page 189 -->

omelet and a hot roll and butter, when Mr. Barton came down
and seated himself in a vacant chair opposite to us.  His presence
did not in the least affect my appetite, but it had a different influence
upon Pauline.</p>

<p>We continued our breakfast without appearing to notice our
jealous <i>vis a vis</i>, who watched us very narrowly, and to provoke
him I was rather more tender in my attentions to Pauline than I
might have been if he had not been a looker-on.  We had nearly
finished our meal, when the steward of the boat came along
calling out, "tickets, gentlemen&mdash;tickets, if you please.  Don't
keep me waiting."</p>

<p>Just then it occurred to me that I had neglected to pay my
passage, so I put my hand in my pocket to pull out my purse,
and make another provoking display before my old rival, of my
roll of bank bills, which would be as good as telling him that I
had money enough in my pocket to defy him.  But, thrusting my
hand into an empty pocket had the effect of an electric shock
upon my nerves, and I nearly fainted when I remembered that I
had left my purse and my watch under the pillow of the bed in
which I slept at old Gil's house.  Not only had I left my money,
and the only things of value which I possessed that I could
leave in pledge with the steward of the boat, but I had left the
note which old Gil had given me for the money I had deposited
in his hands for safe keeping.  Mr. Barton perceived the change
in my feelings at the approach of the ticket collector and probably
guessed at the cause, for he appeared to brighten up, and a
triumphant smile passed across his countenance.</p>

<p>"Pauline, darling," said I, whispering in her ear, "did you
bring your purse with you?"</p>

<p>But Pauline, if she had a purse, had not thought it necessary
to put it into her small travelling bag, which contained her whole
store of laces but not a shilling in ready money.</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen! tickets! tickets!" exclaimed the steward,
stopping opposite to where we sat, and reaching out his
hand.  "Don't keep me waiting.  Tickets!"

<!-- Volume II, page 190 -->

<p>"To be candid with you," said I, "I have no ticket."</p>

<p>"Money, then," said the steward.  "Out with your money.
Don't keep me waiting."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately my money is out already," said I.  "I have
come off and left my purse at home.  But I will pay you when
I return."</p>

<p>" 'Twon't do!" exclaimed the steward, looking me sharply in
the face; "you can't come such a game as that here.  We are
used to such customers as you.  I have seen you before, old
fellow, so just step out here and go on deck with me to the captain."</p>

<p>Mr. Barton, who had been sitting with a flushed face listening
to the conversation between us, now jumped up from his seat and
walked out of the cabin in great haste; and, I had no doubt,
with the intention of prejudicing the mind of the captain against
me.</p>

<p>Pauline was now terribly frightened, and I had great difficulty
in soothing her fears, which added not a little to my embarrassment.
All the passengers at the table had huddled around us,
and I found myself a most uncomfortable object of suspicion to
them.  A thought suddenly occurred to me, and I determined to
make an appeal to the passengers, not doubting that I should find
some one among them who would have the generosity to help
me out of my difficulty.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said I, mounting on the seat which I had occupied
at the table, "you appear to feel a very great interest in
my affairs, for which please accept my thanks and those of the
young lady under my protection; you are very good to evince so
much generosity of feeling towards entire strangers, which emboldens
me to hope that there may be somebody among you willing
to help me out of the difficulty in which I find myself accidentally
placed."</p>

<p>Several of the most inquisitive-looking among them at this
remark took up their hats, and said they must go on deck.&mdash;But
a very few remained behind, and I continued my appeal.

<!-- Volume II, page 191 -->

<p>"The truth is, gentlemen, that I came away this morning in
company with a young lady, and intended to go as far as Philadelphia,
but since I sat down to the breakfast table I find that I
have left my pocket-book and watch behind me, and as I know
but one person on board the boat, there is nobody of whom I can
borrow the money to pay our passage.  If any gentleman will
loan me the requisite sum, I will pay him double on my return
to New York."</p>

<p>This candid appeal had a different effect, altogether, upon my
auditors from what I anticipated.  Not a soul offered to lend me a
sixpence, but one or two whistled, while another put his hand
up to his nose mockingly.  But there was one old gentleman who
had listened respectfully to me, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You remarked that you knew but one person on board the
boat, why do you not apply to him; because he does know
you?"</p>

<p>"Partly for that reason," I replied, "but not because he
knows any harm of me."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" demanded the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Barton," said I.</p>

<p>"Barton!" exclaimed the old gentleman; "I know him
well, and if he will say that you are an honest man I will lend
you the money, and you may pay me when you find it convenient.
But here comes Mr. Barton.  How is it sir?  Is this
young gentleman an honest fellow?  He says that he knows
you well and that you know him."</p>

<p>"Has he the impudence to acknowledge that I know him?"
said Mr. Barton, smiling; "it is more than I should have expected,
and it shows how hardened he is in his villainy.  Yes,
gentlemen," continued Mr. Barton, turning to the passengers, "I
do know him, to my sorrow; a greater scamp is not at large."</p>

<p>"Ah! you will repent of that expression," said I.  "Gentlemen
I cannot explain to you the cause of his animosity to me.
But I appeal to the lady under my charge who will assure you
that it is purely malignant."

<!-- Volume II, page 192 -->

<p>"Who is the young lady?" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"I am his cousin," said Pauline, speaking quickly, as if fearful
that I should divulge the secret of her name.</p>

<p>"O, ho!  You are cousins," said the old gentleman, who
evidently was prejudiced in my favor, notwithstanding the remarks
of Mr. Barton.  "And pray, sir, what is your name?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you his name, and the name of the young lady
too;" said Mr. Barton, drawing him aside and whispering in his
ear.</p>

<p>I now saw that there was no hope for me, and the unfortunate
falsehood uttered by Pauline would only tend to convince the old
gentleman of the truth of Mr. Barton's charges against me.
The two withdrew from the cabin together, and after a short
time returned with the captain of the boat, who told me that I
must either pay my passage or go immediately ashore, as the
boat was approaching the landing place at Perth Amboy.  The
captain was perfectly quiet and gentlemanly in his manner, but
he was immoveable, and I soon found that it would be as idle to
talk to his steam engine as to hope to make an impression upon
him by an appeal to his generosity.  To the hysterical sobs of
Pauline, he was quite as indifferent as to the arguments I used
in trying to convince him that I was entitled to his sympathy.
The boat was approaching the landing place at Perth Amboy,
where some freight was to be put ashore before going to the regular
landing place on the opposite side of the river where passengers
took carriages for Philadelphia, and the captain urged
me upon deck, telling me that I must go on shore there.</p>

<p>Pauline said that she would go with me; but as my difficulties
would only be increased by having her with me in a strange
place without a penny in my pocket, I was rather relieved than
vexed when the old gentleman who had appeared to feel so much
interest in me, called me one side and said: "I learn, young
man, from Mr. Barton, that the young lady in your company is
the daughter of my friend, Mr. Gilson.  Is it so?"</p>

<p>I told him that she was.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 193 -->

<p>"And she has run away from her father's house to be married&mdash;is
that so?"</p>

<p>I informed him that it was.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "I think better of you for your candor;
and I think you must allow that it will be better that the young
lady return to her father; trust her to me and I will see that
she shall be tenderly cared for, and restored to her parents.&mdash;There
is no necessity for your being married tonight.  If
you love each other, a month, a year, or five years hence, will be
time enough; and if you are indeed worthy of her, there is no
danger that her father will long object to your marrying her."</p>

<p>"Sir," I replied, "You have shown so much kindness in your
manner towards me, and manifested so much good sense in your
advice that I feel strongly inclined to listen to it.  But, perhaps
you do not know that Mr. Barton is, himself, a suitor for the hand
of the young lady, and that his animosity to me is owing to her
preference for me?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman opened his eyes very wide as I told him
this, and appeared a good deal surprised.</p>

<p>"There is something in your manner," said he, "that makes
me confide in your statement.  But you are a stranger to me,
and Mr. Barton is an old acquaintance whose good will it is important
to me to preserve.  Put this in your pocket," and he
slily slipped a half eagle into my hand, "but let nobody know
that I gave it to you.  Go quietly ashore at Amboy, and call upon
me at my office, when you return to New York.  Here is my
card."</p>

<p>I slipped the card and the coin into my pocket, and seeing that
resistance would be unavailing, as there was a prejudice against
me in the minds of all on board from what Mr. Barton had said,
excepting only the old gentleman, I had no other alternative than
to take leave of Pauline, and cautioning her against the wiles of
Mr. Barton, and to return to her father's house, and wait until
she should hear from me again, I submitted to my fate with as
good a grace as I could.

<!-- Volume II, page 194 -->

<p>We had a very tender parting, for Pauline seemed wholly unmindful
of the public manner of our separation, and gave herself
up to as many endearing expressions as though we had been
alone, and I must confess that they were far from giving me any
displeasure, for I knew what effect they would have upon Mr.
Barton, and that her earnestness would tend to give my new
friend a higher opinion of me.  As the boat remained but a few
minutes at the dock I was hurried ashore by the captain, and left
Pauline weeping on the deck, and supported by our new friend,
whose name I had not yet learned.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton eyed me with an expression of scornful gratification
as I stood upon the tumble-down old wharf, surrounded
by an idle crowd of boys and oystermen, who had assembled to
see the passengers land.  Being the only person who had come
ashore, and not knowing exactly whither to turn, they began to
eye me with suspicion, and an old man in a red shirt and an
antique hat offered his services to me for the consideration of a
ten-pence, if I wished to find anybody, or go anywhere.  But I
declined his services, and to avoid the gaze of the idle crowd
who were sunning themselves in front of a small grocery near
the wharf, I buttoned up my coat, and walked up through the
quiet streets of this decaying old town, as though I were in
pursuit of somebody, and soon found myself alone on the highway.</p>

<p>Finding myself alone, with no one to observe me but a cow
that was nipping the scant pasturage by the road-side, I sat down
upon the clean green sward, and examined the card which the
old gentleman on board the boat had slipped into my hand.  It
bore the name of Andrew Bonfield, which I remembered very
well, having often seen it among old Gil's papers, when
I was acting as a clerk in his office; but I remembered nothing
more in relation to him, and supposed that he was one of the
victims whom old Gil sometimes loaned money to at usurious
rates.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p>I HAD been sitting on the green sward by the road-side nearly
an hour, gazing up into the soft blue sky and listening to the
droning noises, that came mellowed to my ear from the surrounding
fields, and inhaling the delicious air that was fragrant with
the mingled odors of blossoming fruit trees, lilacs, and other early
flowers, of which there was a rich abundance in the little gardens
surrounding the farm-houses in the neighborhood,&mdash;when a gentlemanly
looking young person walked past me, carrying an
umbrella in one hand and a small undressed leather portmanteau
in the other; it was the first person I had seen since I
had been sitting there, and I raised my head to look at him;
he did not seem to notice me but kept steadily forward until he
came to a turn in the road, when looking back he seemed, for
the first time, to observe me.  He paused suddenly, and after
looking towards me a few minutes, retraced his steps and stopped
opposite to me, and said, in a frank, easy manner, "How are
you?"</p>

<p>I nodded in reply to his friendly salutation, and he said:</p>

<p>"Fine morning;" as if to give me an opportunity to be sociable
if I wished.  But I did not feel disposed to talk, and I
merely replied, "Yes."</p>

<p>"You don't know me?" said he.</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not to be wondered at, for I suppose you never
saw me before," said he.  "However, I don't know you, and so
we are on equal terms."  Having said this, he threw down his
portmanteau and umbrella, and seated himself near me.  "It's
a most delicious morning, isn't it?" said he; "I do declare, I
think this place is a perfect Paradise, if there ever was one.  I
suppose you belong here?"</p>

<p>I told him that I did not, and was only there by the most unlooked
for accident, and should leave the place by the next
steamboat that stopped at the landing.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 196 -->

<p>"Well, I suppose the place looks different to me than what it
does to you, for I know something about it, although I don't
live here.  I only wish I did.  Lord!  to live here would be living,
but to live anywhere else&mdash;don't mention it&mdash;it will be death
to me."</p>

<p>"Pray," said I, "what is there so enchanting about the place?
I must confess I see nothing that is so very inviting, although the
air is pure, the fields are pleasant to look at, and the river yonder
is a broad and lovely stream.  But all these things may be seen
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"That's all very true.  Exactly so.  The air is pure enough
in any part of this blessed country of ours, and as for green fields
there are enough of them anywhere.  But there is something
else here, and something that can be found nowhere else.  Can't
you guess what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no," I replied.</p>

<p>"Were you ever in love?" said he, looking me in the face;
"did you ever know what it was to feel as if you were willing
to die for a woman? to have your feelings so wrapped up in her
that you would feel it a privilege to be trod upon and trampled
under her darling feet?  Whether you ever did or not, is no
matter; I am just in that condition myself.  I know I am a fool,
I am a complete ass; but I can't help it, and I am glad of it.&mdash;You
laugh!  Well, you may laugh at me and welcome; I declare
to you it would give me an actual pleasure to be despised
for her sake."</p>

<p>"No, I was not laughing at you," I replied; "I was only
laughing to think of the oddity of my meeting with a person in
a condition so nearly like my own."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me so!" exclaimed the man, throwing his
arms about my neck and hugging me uncomfortably tight; "you
don't say it!  Well, how odd!  But don't tell me now, that you
have been refused by your lady?"</p>

<p>"O, no," said I; "quite the reverse.  But since you are so
very frank with me, you shall know just what an odd condition

<!-- Volume II, page 197 -->

I am in, and then you may pity me, or laugh at me, just as you
please."</p>

<p>I then told him how I had eloped with Pauline, and of the unlucky
accident which had caused me to be sitting there, instead
of being on my way to Philadelphia to be married.  He heard
me patiently to the end, and then said:</p>

<p>"You are a happy man; you will return to New York, get
your money, and run off again; but if you shouldn't, you will
be happy, you are happy now, in knowing that the young lady
loves you.  But as for me, I tell you I am dead in love with one
of the most fascinating, gentle, beautiful creatures on earth, and
I don't believe she cares anything more for me than I do for that
old cow in the next field."</p>

<p>"That is a pitiable case, indeed,'" said I, "and if I were in
your place, I would certainly try to get the better of my love."</p>

<p>"Get the better of it!" he exclaimed, jumping upon his feet,
and dashing his hat into the dusty road; "you might as well tell
me to get the better of the color of my eyes.  I can't help it.  I
tell you I love her, and yet I can give you no reason for it; I
have tried to argue myself out of it, and the more I try, the worse
I grow.  If I don't get the better of it, I shall have to jump into
the river with my pockets full of stones.  It's enough to wear me
out; I can't do any business, and I shall go to ruin; she sees it
all, and yet she won't give me the least cause to hope that she
will ever feel any differently towards me."</p>

<p>"Is she then so cold hearted?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, don't say that&mdash;she has a warm heart for everybody but
me; she is as tender to the pigs and chickens as though they
were her brothers and sisters, and everybody praises her goodness
and kindness.  She loves everybody, and that is what makes
me so miserable to think of.  If I were a dog, a hog, or a cat, or
a ragged boy, or an old blind beggar, she would be kind to me
and pity me; but now she hates me, I do believe, and loves
everybody and everything besides in the world.  Isn't it too
hard?"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 198 -->

<p>"It is very hard; but you do yourself an injustice, I must
think," said I.  "Such a gentle and tender hearted creature
cannot surely hate a man merely for loving her.  Perhaps she
only prefers another person to you."</p>

<p>"If I thought she did," said he, grinding his teeth, "I would
murder him.  I would have his life."</p>

<p>"If you really loved her," said I, "you would not feel so savagely
disposed towards the objects of her regard; but anything
she bestowed her love upon would be sacred to you."</p>

<p>"Would it?  No, no, you are mistaken, because you have
never been really in love yourself.  I know I love her, and I
know I hate and detest everything she loves.  If you had seen
me kick that rascal of a dog of hers that she allows to lick her
hand every day, you would have known how I felt.  It is some
satisfaction to me to know that I have half killed the cur.  Just
think of it, that I love her more than twenty thousand dogs could,
and she will not give me the least look of regard, while if a little
cur just wag his tail at her, she pats him on the head and lets
him lick her little plump white hand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "the reason that she does not love you, is
because she had formed an attachment for some one before she
had seen you."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the thing that drives me crazy," exclaimed the
stranger, again jumping upon his feet and swinging his arms
about as though he were fighting with some invisible antagonist;
"that is the thought that kills me, and I believe that it is so too.
I have heard her mother say something about a person that she
calls Thomas, but whether he is a brother, a cousin, a lover, or
what not, I can't find out.  But I have suspicion he was some
way or other connected with her and stood in my way.  If I
only knew him, I believe I could kill him as easily as I would
smash a mosquito."</p>

<p>"Did you want my advice?" said I; "is that the reason of
your making me your confidant?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want any advice; I can't take anybody's advice.

<!-- Volume II, page 199 -->

I am driven to desperation, and it is some relief to me to open
my feelings to you.  You are a stranger and we shall never
meet again; and if I should ever get the better of my feelings,
you will not be able to laugh at me for my weakness.  I know
I am foolish and extravagant, but I can't help it, and I am going
off tomorrow to travel among strangers and try to forget her if I
can."</p>

<p>"Is the young lady a native here?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, not a native, but, like myself, she dropped in here a few
years ago, as if on purpose to ruin me; and yet I am so foolishly
in love with her that I would not have missed knowing her
for the whole world.  I was doing well here, at school keeping,
and was in a fair way of making my fortune in the world, when
this young lady's mother came here and hired that little white
house you see opposite the apple orchard up the road, and from
that day I have been growing worse and worse.  The young
lady was nearly grown up, but her mother must send her to me
to finish her education.  Heaven knows she was more fit to teach
me than to learn of me; but I was, of course, glad to have a
new pupil, and particularly one who was just from New York,
and whose manners would be likely to have a good influence
upon my younger scholars."</p>

<p>"Then she came from New York?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the enamored schoolmaster, "and I do not believe
that the whole city could produce another to compare with
her.  She is the incarnation of everything that is lovely and
winning, and as much as I love her, I cannot blame her for not
loving me in return.  I know she is superior to me, and entitled
to a better husband than I could be to her; and still I am such
a fool as to insist on her loving me.  But she never will.  No,
I feel that she is destined to a higher position than I could ever
hope to place her in.  But, I will tell you one thing, it will not
be good for the man who marries her to fall in my way afterwards."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you look upon yourself in the light of a discoverer,"

<!-- Volume II, page 200 -->

said I, "and think yourself entitled to the young lady because
you were the first to fall in love with her.  But there are no
patents granted by society in such cases, I believe, although I
am not sure that there ought not to be.  It would be a very convenient
law for us if we could claim the privileges of copyright
in such cases."</p>

<p>"Don't make fun of me, if you please," said the schoolmaster
with a rueful look; "I am miserable enough already, and if you
laugh at me I shall move off and leave you."</p>

<p>"Just as you please," said I; "but I had no thought of making
fun of you; I was only applying my thoughts to my own case;
for it surely is a very great hardship, after one has discovered a
woman worth loving, developed her fascinations, and bestowed
his heart upon her, to have another come along and rob him of
his property.  Indeed, now that I think of the matter again, if
priority of discovery should be allowed as a just claim for right
of property in anything, it surely ought to be in that which most
affects our happiness."</p>

<p>"I agree with you on that point exactly," said the rueful
schoolmaster; "and I think that to run off with a man's wife is
not half so wicked as to deprive him of the woman he was the
first to fall in love with; and since you are of that way of thinking,
and have already disposed of your heart in another quarter,
I have a great mind to let you see this young lady, whose loveliness
I was the first to discover."</p>

<p>"I should be most delighted to see her," said I, "and who
knows that I may not be able to convince her of her unreasonableness
in rejecting a man who loves her so ardently."</p>

<p>"O, if you could I would be your slave forever," said the schoolmaster.
"Come, let us go to her mother's house.  She will
treat you kindly and give you a hearty reception, as she does everybody."</p>

<p>"Has the young lady no brother or father?" asked I.</p>

<p>"She has no brother," I believe," said he, "unless it be that
villain Thomas; and as for her father, he is at sea.  It is two

<!-- Volume II, page 201 -->

years since they came here to live, and all that time I have been
falling deeper and deeper in love; and the more I have tried to
get out of it, the worse it has been for me.  As soon as the
young lady discovered that I had a regard for her she left my
school, and although both she and her mother have always treated
me in the kindest manner, she would never permit me to say a
syllable to her about love.  You needn't be at all backward
about going there, for they are quite different from the other
people about here, and will be as polite and unreserved to you
as though you were an old friend.  I have sometimes thought
that she must be some great man's daughter in disguise, or
a runaway princess, or something of the kind, there is such a
superiority of manner about her.  If you ever had a dream of
an angel, or a queen, or anything superhuman and heavenly,
she will fully realize your highest fancy, and I dare say, go a
little beyond it.  I only wish I was a Governor, or a member
of Congress for her sake, for then she might be persuaded to
marry me, and I should have some confidence in myself in asking
her."</p>

<p>"You either do her or yourself an injustice," I said, "for if
she is the superior being that you represent her, she would not
listen to you any more for the accidents of fortune or station;
and I am greatly mistaken if she would not take pride in bestowing
herself upon a school master, whom she loved for his good
qualities, rather than upon a Governor whom she only respected
for his station."</p>

<p>"I wish I could think so," replied the schoolmaster, shaking
his head and drawing a long sigh; "but, at any rate, it would
give me immense pleasure to have it in my power to bestow
upon her the gifts of fortune which I wish I were endowed with.
Here is that splendid creature wasting her sweetness on this desert
air, and absolutely throwing away her smiles and kind words
on oystermen and country bumpkins, and saying the sweetest
things to a parcel of grunting pigs and cackling poultry; and
here am I, a human being, ready to worship her and marry her,

<!-- Volume II, page 202 -->

to whom she will say nothing that is either kind, or encouraging.
You will not blame me for feeling such a hatred of everything
that she loves when you shall have seen her."</p>

<p>My curiosity was so much excited to see this rustic divinity
that I was guilty, perhaps, of a piece of dissimulation in not
expressing my feelings lest the schoolmaster's jealousies should
be aroused and he should refuse to conduct me to her. As we
walked up the green lane which led to the little white-washed
cottage in which the Circe dwelt, the schoolmaster entertained
me with a good many stories of the rivalries, heart-burnings, and
small-village wars, occasioned by the marvelous charms of the
young lady who seemed to have excited as much hatred in the
hearts of all the ladies as she had love in the hearts of all the
men.  "If you will believe me, sir," said the schoolmaster with
a doubting air, as though he did not expect to be credited, in the
monstrous disclosure he was about to make, "even the clergy
man's lady has refused to call upon her, and has got up a report
that she is somebody's mistress."</p>

<p>"I would as readily believe such a thing of a clergyman's
wife as of any layman's," said I, "for, as far as my experience
goes, I have never found that either the wives or daughters of
clergymen were freer from female foibles than the wives and
daughters of other men."</p>

<p>"The daughters!" exclaimed the schoolmaster, "why, it is
to the daughters that all the scandal can be traced that has been
uttered against that innocent young creature who, I believe in
my soul, is as pure as her own pet lamb.  The truth is, the Miss
Hornfagers are the oldest and ugliest young ladies anywhere
about, and as they are very virtuous and pious themselves, they
seem to have made up their minds that every young lady who is
at all good looking must be in league with Satan himself, and
given over to reprobate courses.  As for the doctor, he too, like
his lady, holds the same belief that virtue and ugliness are one
and the same thing.  He actually shakes his head doubtingly at
every pretty girl in the neighborhood, and the incomparable

<!-- Volume II, page 203 -->

sweetness, beauty and gentleness of my pupil, at the first going
off, gained her such a shake of the head from Parson Hornfager
and his wife and daughters, that the poor thing has never recovered
from it to this day; and all the people round about here
say she is no better than she should be, for no other reason than
because she is so much better than any of them.  However,"
continued the schoolmaster, "she knows nothing about these
scandalous imputations, and is just as happy and innocent, and
merry as a humming bird, in spite of them.  If there should be
anything wrong about her, it must be owing to that Thomas.&mdash;Look!
look!" he exclaimed, suddenly stopping and pointing with
his finger to the house, which we had approached within a few
yards.  "Isn't she perfectly beautiful?"</p>

<p>"I see nobody," I replied, "but an old woman in the garden."</p>

<p>"An old woman!" he exclaimed in a frenzied manner; "it
is the Lost Pleiad.  It is my pupil herself.  Don't you see how
prettily she stands tying up a vine to that little trellis.  What
wouldn't I give to be that nasturtium that is looking her in the
face as she stoops over it?"</p>

<p>I could see nothing of the beauties or fascinations that so entranced
the schoolmaster, for the figure that he pointed at as the
Lost Pleiad, was that of a female dressed in a calico gown, with a
large white hood on her head, which so entirely covered her face
and shoulders, that it was impossible to distinguish whether she
were eighteen or eighty.  But I soon perceived from the ease of
her motions, and the apparent quickness of her step, that she was
young, and on a near approach, I could see that she had a round
and delicate arm.  The Lost Pleiad appeared to be engaged in
the very pretty occupation of trimming a vine of nasturtiums
which were in full blossom, and, like Proserpine, she might
have been the fairest flower in her garden, but I could see
nothing of her beauties save a glimpse of her arm, which was
promising and satisfactory as far as it went.</p>

<p>As we had approached very near to the garden fence she
probably heard our voices, for she suddenly dropped a vine that

<!-- Volume II, page 204 -->

she held in her hands, and ran into the house.  The schoolmaster
followed her retreating form with his eyes, and, as she
disappeared, broke out in a new exclamation of praise of her
grace and dignity, not trusting to his own powers this time but
quoting the lines which Milton applies to Eve.  The cottage was
one of those common wooden houses which abound in New
Jersey&mdash;small, slightly built, but neat, quiet-looking and comfortable.
A little more care had been bestowed upon the tidiness
of the stoop and door, and the windows were all draped with
snowy white dimity, and some of them made a display of pots
of geraniums and small rose buds.  There was an air of refinement
about the premises, which were humble, that would have
prepossessed me in favor of the inmates, even though the schoolmaster
had not given me so glowing an account of them.</p>

<p>"Do this Lost Pleiad of yours and her mother," I asked of the
schoolmaster, "reside here constantly alone?"</p>

<p>"Constantly," he replied; "they have had but one visitor
since they came here, and that was an elderly looking gentleman
who had the appearance of a foreigner; I never knew
where he came from, nor what his name was; he remained but
two or three hours, and has not been seen here since."</p>

<p>"Then they will be better pleased to see a stranger," said I.</p>

<p>"Of course, they will," replied the schoolmaster; "and now
I think of it, you are too good looking.  I won't introduce you
there."</p>

<p>"O, very well; then I shall introduce myself," said I; "you
have excited my curiosity to see this Lost Pleiad, and as I have
a couple of hours more to remain here before the steamboat returns,
I shall be glad of so delightful a spot to rest in."</p>

<p>The poor schoolmaster looked very rueful as I announced my
determination to make the acquaintance of the young lady and
her mother, and told me that if I would promise him on oath not to
fall in love with the daughter, that he would introduce me at the
cottage.</p>

<p>But I refused to pledge myself, not because I had any expectations

<!-- Volume II, page 205 -->

of such an event, but because the comical term of the
poor schoolmaster was so amusing, and I felt sure of relieving his
whimsical fears as soon as we should leave the cottage.  Finding
that he could neither prevent my going into the house, nor prevail
upon me to promise not to fall in love with the Lost Pleiad, he at
last consented with a very awkward grace to introduce me, and
going timidly to the door of the cottage rapped with his knuckles
upon the panel, for there was neither knocker nor bell to the
dwelling of the Lost Pleiad.  We had not long to wait for admittance.</p>

<p>"She is coming," said the schoolmaster in a tremulous whisper;
and the next moment the upper half of the door was swung
open, and a good natured countenance exhibited itself which
was very far from reminding me of the Lost Pleiad, as I had
never associated the idea of an old lady in a cotton cap with that
celestial stranger.</p>

<p>"O! 'evans!" exclaimed the old lady who had opened the
door.  "I never saw anythink like it.  Have you come back again,
Mr. Gossitt?"</p>

<p>"For a brief visit only, Mrs. Swayne," replied the schoolmaster;
"I shall not trouble you long, nor again, very soon."</p>

<p>"O! don't say anythink like that," said Mrs. Swayne, whom
I instantly recognized as my old guardian of Hague street.&mdash;"Don't
say such a think.  Come in out of the sun."</p>

<p>"Here's a gentleman I would like to introduce to you and
Miss Sylvia," said the schoolmaster, "who is going in the boat
with me to New York."</p>

<p>"Won't you walk in, too, sir?" said Mrs. Swayne, opening
the other section of the door, and looking out to take a close view
of my person.  "Sylvia will be glad to see you, I am sure, sir."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten to enquire your name," said the schoolmaster,
turning to me.</p>

<p>"Pepper," I replied.</p>

<p>"May I have the pleasure of making you acquainted with
Mr. Pepper?" said he, addressing himself formally to the old

<!-- Volume II, page 206 -->

lady, who was scrutinizing me with an earnest gaze that made
me feel rather nervous.  "Mr. Pepper, Mrs. Swayne.  Mrs.
Swayne, Mr. Pepper."</p>

<p>"Good 'evans preserve me!" cried Mrs. Swayne, rushing from
the stoop.  "Why, if it isn't Thomas!  Why, who could have
thought of such a think?"</p>

<p>The kind hearted old creature threw her arms about my neck
and gave me a kiss before I was aware of what she was going
to do.  In truth, I was hardly less rejoiced to see her, than she
appeared to be at meeting me unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Sylvia, Sylvia," called out the overjoyed old lady, running
back to the door, "Sylvia come here.  It is Master Thomas.  It
is your old playmate, Master Thomas Pepper.  Come in, come
in, Master Thomas; Sylvia will be delighted to see you, I am
sure.  Where did you come from?  I never knew anythink like
it before.  Why, dear heart, what has become of Mr. Gossitt?
Why, what is that poor man running away for?"</p>

<p>Looking round, I discovered the schoolmaster running with all
his might towards the river.  Poor wretch!  He was probably
so terrified at discovering in me the very Thomas of whom he
had entertained such a dread, that he gave up the Lost Pleiad as
beyond all hope of recovery, and was hastening away that he
might not be pained by witnessing the joy of our meeting.</p>

<p>As I had some fears that the poor fellow was hastening to the
river to drown himself, I felt impelled to run after him, and save
him from an end which I had unconsciously brought upon him.
But as Mrs. Swayne's vociferous calls for Sylvia soon brought
the Lost Pleiad to the door, the first glimpse of her beautiful face
caused me to instantly forget the schoolmaster.  I saw at once
that the unfortunate pedant had not fallen in love with my old
playmate without sufficient cause; and what had before appeared
to me a ridiculous passion, I now thought a perfectly rational
feeling.</p>

<p>I was completely awe-struck at the beauty of Sylvia, who had
grown entirely out of my recollection.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 207 -->

<p>"Dear mother," said Sylvia, stopping upon the grass plat in
front of the door, "what is the matter?  Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is Master Thomas, your old play mate," replied
Mrs. Swayne; "don't you know him?"</p>

<p>"O! is it, indeed?" said Sylvia, turning her head from me
and retreating towards the door; "I did not understand you,
mother.  Mr. Pepper will excuse my running to the door.  I
thought it was the schoolmaster."</p>

<p>"Why, where is the girl going?" exclaimed Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pepper will excuse your running to the door, but not
your running away from it, because he happened to be there,"
said I stepping before her.</p>

<p>Sylvia blushed and smiled, and said that I must pardon her, as
she hardly knew what she said.  Thereupon I took her hand,
and pressed it, and led her into the cottage and was followed by
her mother, who began to bustle about to show me that I was
welcome.</p>

<p>I could see no traces in the tall, graceful, rosy-cheeked and
black-eyed young lady before me, of the frolicsome little Sylvia
with whom I had romped in Hague street; and but for the well
remembered face and voice of her mother, I could scarcely have
believed that she was the same individual being.  Sylvia's voice
was soft and musical as her face was lovely, and the charming
simplicity of her manners heightened the beauties of her person.
The little house in which they lived was furnished in the most
simple and unostentatious manner; there was no pianoforte, nor
music stands, nor worsted work, nor cheap pictures in costly
frames, nor any of the conventional upholstery, with which
ambitious housekeepers in New York encumber their parlors;
but the furniture was of the plainest description, and everything
wore the appearance of perfect neatness and order.</p>

<p>"It was so good of you, Master Thomas, to come and see us,"
said Mrs. Swayne, "for Sylvia and me have talked of you every
day."</p>

<p>"Mother!" said Sylvia.  "Why, mother!"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 208 -->

<p>"It is as true as I stand here, Master Thomas," said Mrs.
Swayne.</p>

<p>"Can you not say Mr. Pepper, mother," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"No, I can't, and I am not a going to try," said Mrs.  Swayne;
"and I am sure Master Thomas doesn't wish me to."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said I; "but you forget that my name is not
Thomas, but Tom."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say Tom, Master Thomas," said Mrs. Swayne,
"I am sure I couldn't be so disrespectful as that.  But, as I was
saying, Sylvia and me have talked about you every day; but
we never expected to see you again, and here you have come
and found us out.  Well, it was very good in you, and we are
very glad to see you.  I am sure Sylvia is, and I know I am."</p>

<p>"I am very glad that I stumbled upon you," I replied.  "for
my coming was purely accidental; and I did not know that you
lived here until I saw you at the door."</p>

<p>"Well, there never was anythink like it!" again exclaimed
Mrs. Swayne, stopping to express her astonishment as she was
spreading her table; "there never was, I am sure.  And where
did you find poor Mr. Gossitt, the schoolmaster?  Poor creature!
You don't know how he has tormented Sylvia, poor child."</p>

<p>"He has never tormented me, mother," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"No, I dare say the torment has been all with the other side,"
said I.</p>

<p>Sylvia blushed and said she hoped not, for Mr. Gossitt was a
very excellent person, and she should be sorry to torment him.
But she feared the poor man was not altogether right in his mind.
Mrs. Swayne made an attempt to wink at me, which was not
successful, and then she broke out again with an exclamation of,
"Well, there never was anythink like it!"  And then the good
old creature informed me that "Swine," her husband, having
gone to sea on a long cruise, and left her half-pay to subsist
upon in his absence, she had moved into the country for economy's
sake, and that she and Sylvia had been living very happily
and very obscurely by themselves, in the little wooden cottage

<!-- Volume II, page 209 -->

where I stumbled upon them.  Sylvia had learned all the mysteries
of poultry hatching, and had become an adept at kitchen
gardening; but in practicing her out-door callings, she had so
prudently sheltered herself from the sun and the wind, by covering
up her head with a large muslin hood, that she looked as
fair as though she had never walked out of doors except under
the shade of an awning.  But there was a healthy glow in her
cheek, and a ruddiness of the lips, not often seen in those ladies
who only take the air on the sidewalk; and her hands, although
beautifully formed, showed that they had been accustomed to
handle a heavier implement than a needle or a pen.  If Sylvia
did not know that she was beautiful, her mother did, and was
very careful that no exposure should mar the ripening charms
of her daughter, and had never suffered her to engage in any
occupation not consistent with her delicate frame.</p>

<p>Mothers have an admirable instinct in such things, and know
the value of personal beauty too well to permit their daughters
to spoil the advantages which indulgent nature confers upon
them.  Sylvia's mother doubtless had indulged in visions of the
future position in the world of her daughter, and looked upon her
bright eyes, brilliant complexion, pearly teeth, luxuriant hair, her
graceful form and lovely smile, as her capital stock, and, I fear,
overlooked the greater charms of her gentle disposition and generous
nature.  I was not so cool and calculating as to make
any of these reflections while conversing with Sylvia, but unresistingly
yielded myself up to the fascinations of her presence.
These thoughts all came afterwards.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Swayne appeared determined to construe my chance
visit into one of design, I was forced to tell her the particulars of
the accident which had led me to her cottage; and I was careful
to let Sylvia know the nature of my engagement with Pauline,
lest she should suspect that I had some design upon her
affections.  She expressed a good deal of compassion for Pauline,
but her mother was content to say that she had never before
knew anythink like it.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 210 -->

<p>"Do tell me, Master Thomas, I mean Mr. Pepper," said
Mrs. Swayne, "if your father, the Captain, knew you were going to
run away with that young lady."</p>

<p>"My father!" said I. "Alas!  I do not know where my father
is, Mrs. Swayne, I fear that I shall never see him again."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Sylvia, did you ever hear anythink like that?"
exclaimed Mrs. Swayne; "why, when did you see him last,
Master Thomas?  How long is it Sylvia since he was here?"</p>

<p>"Since he was here!" I said, starting from my seat; "since
he was here, Mrs. Swayne!  Do you mean Captain St. Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, was there ever anythink like it!  Of course it
was Captain St. Hugh," said Mrs. Swayne, "and of course I
meant him."</p>

<p>"And he has actually been here!" I said.</p>

<p>"It is now more than a year," said Sylvia, "since he came
the last time&mdash;is it not mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and more than two years since he came the first time,"
said Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Pray tell me, if you know, where he is now," said I.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Swayne did not know, or, at least, she pretended
she did not.</p>

<p>"And for what object did Captain St. Hugh come here?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Master Thomas, I do believe he came for nothink in
the world but to talk about you&mdash;for he did nothink else all the
time he was here, and would hear of nothink else."</p>

<p>"To talk about me, Mrs. Swayne! and did he come here to
talk about ne, when he might have talked with me and to me.
It is very strange."</p>

<p>"Well, it is true, Master Thomas; isn't it, Sylvia?" said she.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pepper does not doubt you, mother," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"No, no, I do not doubt you," I replied; "but yet it is so
strange that I cannot believe it.  Did he come to look for me
here?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, he said nothink about looking for you, Master

<!-- Volume II, page 211 -->

Thomas, because he told me where you were; and Sylvia and
me were so glad to hear from you.  Where we not Sylvia?"</p>

<p>Sylvia merely blushed in reply, while Mrs. Swayne continued
to expatiate on the pleasure which Captain St. Hugh had taken
in talking about me; and added that he had made her a handsome
present on parting from her the last time.</p>

<p>I was not more delighted to hear of Captain St. Hugh once
more, than I was puzzled to account for his visit to Mrs. Swayne,
and his avoidance of me in New York, for he must have known
where to find me.  All that I could learn from Mrs. Swayne in
respect to the visit of Captain St. Hugh was that he visited her
for the purpose of drawing from her every fact in relation to my
conduct during the short time that I resided with her in Hague
street.  It was very certain, therefore, that he had not lost his
interest in me, and still took pleasure in talking about me, but I
could find no comfort in this reflection, for it was quite as certain
that he saw nothing in my past conduct to cause him to seek me
again, and acknowledge me as his son, or he would have done so
before.  His conversation with Mrs. Swayne, however, had not
left on her mind the impression that he intended to desert me, and
the utmost of my hopes was that he still retained an affection for
me, which his stern integrity of character could not wholly overcome.
And I might console myself with the thought that he
loved me but was too proud to acknowledge me as his son, because
I had by my former heedlessness and disregard of truth,
brought a disgrace upon my name.  Instead of feeling overjoyed
to hear once more from him, and to know that he was actually
living, I was depressed in spirit and humiliated in feeling, and
could not refrain from tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swayne redoubled her exertions to enliven me, and
Sylvia even, who had before been nearly silent, not knowing
exactly what to do, tried to divert my thoughts by calling my
attention to her flower garden.  While listening to Mrs. Swayne's
account of my father's visit the time had unconsciously flown
away, and it was now too late to return to New York on that

<!-- Volume II, page 212 -->

day by the steamboat, so that I was compelled to remain and
listen still further to the prattle of the old lady, who kept recurring
to Captain St. Hugh in spite of Sylvia's attempts to prevent
her.  The thought occurred to me that my father had been
smitten by the innocent charms of Sylvia, and had only made a
pretense of his interest in me to have an opportunity of being
near her.  But that could not be possible, as he would have
paid more frequent visits to the cottage.  Sylvia herself certainly
had no such thought, nor had her mother, and they would have
been quick enough to catch at such a thing if his conduct had
afforded them an excuse.  I was therefore completely at a loss
to account for the conduct of Captain St. Hugh, and as it was
more than a year since he was at the cottage, he might have
returned to England with a determination to abandon me forever.</p>

<p>"If that is his determination," I said to myself, "I will strive
harder than ever to make him reject it, by my future conduct."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the termination of my attempt to elope
with Pauline would not be likely to remove any of the prejudices
created against me by my early conduct; and even Pauline,
herself, would be likely to suspect me.</p>

<p>Having spent the day with Sylvia and her mother, when night
came I thought it prudent to leave the cottage, and seek for a
lodging in the town, that I might be prepared to return by the
steamboat the next day.  It was quite dark when I left the cottage,
and as I walked through the long lane which led to the
steamboat landing, I perceived that somebody was following me,
and turning suddenly, I saw a man at a short distance behind me,
with his arm raised as though about to hurl something at me
which he held in his hand.  I stopped, and the person dropped
something heavy, and ran; I ran after him, and should probably
have failed to reach him, but he stumbled and fell; and as I came
up to him, I discovered it was the schoolmaster, who was about
to execute vengeance upon me for the warm reception I had
received from the Lost Pleiad.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 213 -->

<p>"It is well for you," said he, as I seized him by the collar,
"that you turned as you did, or you would not now have had a
whole head upon your shoulders."</p>

<p>"What, are you such a madman," said I, "that you would
murder an innocent man who had never injured you, because he
was more fortunate than yourself in being kindly entertained by
the young lady you have fallen in love with?"</p>

<p>"I would do any thing.  I care not what becomes of me.  I
wish I could die.  I am a poor wretch.  Fortune has turned her
back upon me, and the sooner I am done for, and disposed of, the
better it will be for me!" exclaimed the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>There was something pitiful and melancholy in the distresses
of the poor wretch, notwithstanding the extravagance of his language
and his ludicrous manner, which excited my compassion,
or I would have had him arrested for his attempt upon my
life.  "Make yourself easy," said I, "and do not fear me; go
back to your school and, in time, who knows but you may overcome
the aversion of the young lady who has inflamed your passions.</p>

<p>"No, no," said he, in a dolorous tone, "that can never be&mdash;she
will never love me, I know."</p>

<p>"But, if she should not love you, perhaps in time you may
cease to love her, and that would amount to the same thing," I
said.</p>

<p>"Never, never, never!" exclaimed the schoolmaster; "I shall
never cease to love her and worship her as I do now.  She is
my Heaven, and I can never be happy without her.  Go where
I will she will haunt me; and I can never give my mind to any
occupation while I am separated from her; so I have made up my
mind to die this night.  I am desperate and indifferent to my
fate here and hereafter.  If I had murdered you it would give
me pleasure to have been hung for her sake."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the incoherent wildness of his manner, and
his evident recklessness, I had no fear of him, for there did not
appear to be any malice in his disposition; and as to his committing

<!-- Volume II, page 214 -->

suicide or murder, his will seemed to grow weak just at
the point when the execution of his designs should be carried
out.  He promised too much to be feared, so I told him that he
was only wasting his breath in telling me what he was resolved
to do, and again advised him to return to his employment, and
bear up under his crosses like a man.</p>

<p>"Ah!  I have borne up with my crosses until I can do so no
longer.  My time has come, and I am now resolved to make an
end of my worthless existence; but," he continued in a milder
manner, and reaching out his hand, "as you appear to be a gentleman
in feeling, I would like to confide to you the particulars
of my life, so that when I shall be no more, there may be somebody
able to justify my memory.  Will you listen to me while I
recount the incidents of my life?"</p>

<p>As it was yet early in the evening, and the weather was mild,
I consented to listen to the schoolmaster's history, having first
stipulated with him to listen to him no longer than he proved
interesting.  The schoolmaster grasped my hand and thanked
me, and sitting down upon a rock near the road-side, he began
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p>THE SCHOOLMASTER'S HISTORY OF HIS LIFE</p>

</div>

<p>I WAS born in a small town in one of the New England
States, the name of which I will not mention, for you will discover
in the course of my narrative that I have good reasons for wishing
to keep my parentage a secret; for although I am willing
exhibit my own frailties, my mind revolts at the thought of exposing
the foibles and crimes of those who are connected to me
by the nearest ties of nature.  Let me observe now, while the
thought occurs to me, that nobody can really be unhappy in mature
life who can look back upon a happy childhood, and that

<!-- Volume II, page 215 -->

those whose early years are overshadowed by misfortune can
never be truly happy in after life, let their circumstances be as
prosperous as they may.  The shadows and the sunshine
of childhood will never entirely depart from you; therefore,
if you have children, study to make their tender years
joyous, and to keep their minds free from the pollutions of evil
thoughts."</p>

<p>I assured the schoolmaster that I had been deeply impressed
by the truth of his observations from my own experience, and
that I felt a degree of interest in him I should not have anticipated
merely from hearing that his childhood had been unhappy.</p>

<p>"It was not merely unhappy," said the schoolmaster; "it
was dismal, cheerless, black, wretched and desolate.  I suffer
vicariously for the sins of my parents, and am cursed by their
transgressions.  As I now begin to recall the miseries of my
younger days, I forget the despair which has been caused by the
Lost Pleiad.  There are some things which, after all, I cannot
tell you respecting my childhood, for I will not criminate those
who have a right to look to me for protection, but you shall
know enough to gratify me for any act of violence I may commit,
and convince you that it would be less surprising if I were
to live with such a black shadow resting upon my memory and
chilling my heart, than if I should put an end at once to my
miserable existence.  My parents bred all my misfortunes for
me even before my birth; their marriage was the result of a
reckless and guilty passion, and my birth happened in the first
half year of their union.  Thus there was a foundation laid
for me to build up a life of mortifications."</p>

<p>It was fortunate for me that it was so dark, as the schoolmaster
would have seen from my burning cheeks how deeply I sympathized
with him.  Remembering the manner in which I had first
learned the story of my own mother's shame, I asked him how
he learned a fact which his parents would naturally have striven
to keep from him.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 216 -->

<p>"Children learn everything," said he; "they are curious,
inquisitive, and searching, and in affairs which concern their
parents, have an instinctive cunning in ferreting out secrets. I
will tell you how it happened with me, and how I first learned a
fact which has since been a source of wretchedness to me.  In
visiting some of the neighbors, I had seen a family record hanging
upon the walls of a parlor, in a gilt frame.  It was a poor
thing, no doubt, and coarsely executed, but as I had an early
fondness for works of art, this family picture caught my attention
and gave me a good deal of pleasure; it was a representation of
two large red hearts bound together with a pretty blue ribbon,
and out of the centre of the hearts grew two branches, having in
them heart-shaped green leaves, on which were inscribed the
names and ages of the children of the family; while on the red
hearts were inscribed the names of the parents and the date of
their marriage.  In another house I had seen something like
this in the large Bible, and as I had seen nothing of the kind in
the house of my own parents, I asked repeatedly the reason of
it, for I felt mortified that we should not have as much as our
neighbors.  My mother evaded my questions in such a manner
as to awaken my suspicions that she was ashamed to tell me the
true cause, and when I asked my father, he struck me so severe
a blow on the head that it nearly felled me, and told me not to
ask any more impertinent questions.</p>

<p>"One of the servants in the house who had heard me ask
my father, had the maliciousness to give me the information
which I desired.  I was then not quite ten years of age, and although
I could not comprehend the story that the servant told
me, nor understand why it should be the cause of my parents
not having a family record, I could feel the shame of their guilt,
and looked upon them with less reverence than I had ever done
before.  It gave me a painful feeling to know that my parents
had been guilty of misconduct, and that I was myself in some
way connected with it.  It also caused me to feel jealous of
my other brothers, and to think that I was treated with greater harshness

<!-- Volume II, page 217 -->

by my father, and as I grew older, I thought that my mother
regarded me with aversion, as being a living evidence of her indiscretion
and guilt.  But my matured judgment could have
found a thousand excuses for my parents, and I might in time
have forgotten their shame, if I had not, like Falconbridge, have
gloried in it; had there never occurred anything to destroy my
veneration for them, and to cause me to despise their vices even
while I could not but love them.  My mother was a woman of
a quick temper, and of a jealous disposition, while my father was
a trifler in his disposition, and at the same time rough and unfeeling
in his manners.  I do not believe that they had ever
loved each other, and, as I have heard, their marriage was compulsory,
there was little probability of such a beginning having
a happy ending.  My mother had inherited a considerable fortune
from her father which had been nearly all squandered before
I had passed my twelfth year, and then the miseries of my life
commenced with all their bitterness, for in addition to the bickerings
and quarrels, which I had constantly to witness between
my parents, I had to endure the hardships of a biting poverty.
The immediate cause, however, of my father's ruin was very
curious.</p>

<p>"It happened that my mother's brother, who had quarreled
with my father, and never missed an opportunity to vex him,
returned to his native village after an absence of a few years,
and built himself a house directly opposite to the one in which
we lived.  My father's house was one of the largest and handsomest
in the town, but my uncle, as if to annoy him, built his
house a little larger and a little handsomer.  My father watched
the building with an uneasy eye, until it was completed, and
then swore that he would excel it if it ruined him; and directly
began to enlarge his own house by adding a new story,
a wing nearly the size of the main body of the building, and by
painting and ornamenting quite threw my uncle's fine house in
the shade.</p>

<p>"Such a warfare as this, of course, stirred up a good deal of

<!-- Volume II, page 218 -->

feeling in the town, and there were not wanting men who advised
my uncle not to be outdone by his brother-in-law, and instigated
him to a still more lavish outlay of money upon his house.  It
happened, unluckily for both parties, that my uncle's wife was an
ambitious woman, who joined her husband's pretended friends in
advising him to make another effort to out-do my father; and we
soon saw the masons and carpenters at work, adding a Grecian
portico to my uncle's dwelling, and converting his coach-house
into a Greek temple.  Two parties were formed in the town, one
of which espoused the cause of my father, and the other of my
uncle; my uncle's house being of brick, he had the greatest number
of masons on his side, while my father's party numbered
nearly all the carpenters.</p>

<p>"Probably you are aware," continued the schoolmaster, "that
there is no method of getting rid of money more rapidly than by
altering old houses into new ones, or indulging in the caprices
of building.  If you do not, you may readily conceive such a
thing."</p>

<p>"As to that," said I, "I have never had any experience in the
business, except in building castles in the air, which sometimes
proves expensive and ruinous enough."</p>

<p>"Ah!  I have done my full share of that, too," said the schoolmaster,
"and know how ruinous it is, but my father's speculations
had nothing airy about them; his unfortunate architectural
attempts were all embodied in solid materials, which are still
standing as an evidence of his folly; in fact, his house is still
known in the neighborhood as 'Gossitt's Folly,' and my uncle's
might have been called with equal justice 'Gossitt's Ruin.'  My
father soon began to find that he was indulging in a costly kind
of revenge in his attempts to out-build his brother-in-law, who
was in the end the victor, and sufficiently gratified by witnessing
the utter prostration of our fortunes.  It would hardly amuse
you, or interest you, if I were to tell you all the details of the
singular warfare carried on by my father and my uncle; how on
one side was put up a summer-house in the shape of a Chinese

<!-- Volume II, page 219 -->

pagoda, which was directly counterbalanced on the opposite side
of the street by a little temple in the style of the monument of
Lysicrates, for my uncle was more consistent than my father and
stuck to the classic taste with which he had begun; how a
Gothic hen-roost was stared out of countenance by a little temple
of Minerva, with a fighting cock perched on the pediment as
if crowing a defiance to the whole world; how an Elizabethan
green-house, which never had a plant in it, was sternly rebuked
by an Ionic conservatory filled full of orange trees&mdash;and a thousand
more wicked absurdities of the kind, which furnished subjects
for the village gossips to talk about, and gave employment
to all the masons, carpenters, glaziers, and painters; the worst
of it was, that, as my father commenced the foolish rivalry, he
could not give it up, and was, of necessity, always in advance
of my uncle, who had the advantage of his rival's errors to improve
upon.</p>

<p>"By and by my father's means began to give out, his credit
of course grew bad, the mechanics who encouraged him in his
madness found they were likely to be the heaviest losers, and a
stupendous out-house in the form of a baronial castle was left
half finished.  My father's temper was not much sweetened by
being compelled to acknowledge himself beaten, you may be
sure, and our domestic infelicities were more than ever distressing.
My mother reproached my father for his extravagance, and
he, in return, upbraided her for her brother's conduct.  Ah!
many a night did I lie in those unhappy times with my heart beating
with fear when I overheard the angry disputes of my parents,
and trembled in the morning lest I should learn that some act of
violence had been committed.  In those days the laws for imprisoning
poor debtors were in full force, and poor devils who
contracted debts which they were unable to pay were treated
worse than the vilest criminals, for every criminal offence had its
limited term of imprisonment, but debt subjected the poor man to
imprisonment for life.  Society has been a little improved in
some things, since I was a boy, and poverty is not regarded as

<!-- Volume II, page 220 -->

so vile an offence as it was then; if you are frowned upon for
your poverty you are not imprisoned like a felon, and the time
may come when to be poor will not be regarded in the light of a
disgrace."</p>

<p>"I fear not," said I.</p>

<p>"I will not discuss the matter with you," said the schoolmaster,
"but go on with my story, which you will find long enough,
I fear, before I get to the end.  Well, as I was saying, in those
days, men who could not pay their debts were generally shut up
in prison&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To prevent them from ever doing so," I added, "as if to pay,
were as odious to the Law as not to pay."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the schoolmaster, "such is the inconsistency
of the Law.  Well, the moment it was rumored that my father
had failed, there were writs issued against him without number,
everything in the house was seized upon by the sheriff's officers,
the parlors were stripped of their fine furniture, which was all
locked up in our Gothic barn, and the abomination of desolation
seemed to have fallen upon us; but the worst was to come.  The
night after our furniture had been removed, and even the little
bed in which our baby slept had been taken, we sat huddled together
round a small fire our back parlor, which looked cheerless
enough without carpets, or mirrors, and with but half a dozen
chairs, which was all the law allowed, when a loud rap at the
door startled my father, who went out and returned again directly
looking very pale, accompanied by a strange man who shook
the snow from his rough coat as he entered, and told my father
he could not wait long for him.</p>

<p>" 'Who are you,' said my mother, rising and looking angrily
at him, 'and what business have you to intrude yourself in this
manner into a gentleman's house?'</p>

<p>" 'Who am I,' answered the men gruffly; 'don't you know?'</p>

<p>" 'Pardon me,' said she, 'I do now know you, and I suppose I
can guess your business.  You have come to take my husband
to jail&mdash;am I right?'</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 221 -->

<p>" 'I am sorry to say you are,' said the man, who was a deputy
sheriff.</p>

<p>" 'You are sorry to say you are,' said she, 'then why do you
come here?'</p>

<p>" 'I must do my duty,' replied the officer.</p>

<p>" 'Your duty!' said my mother, proudly.  'Your duty! Is it
your duty to deprive my children of their protector and a heart-broken
wife of her husband?  Who made it your duty?  Is it
not enough for you to deprive me of all my property, to leave me
and my children shivering from want in this cold weather, but
you must come and deprive me of my husband?'</p>

<p>" 'The fault is not mine, madam,' said the officer; 'you must
not blame me, but the law, and your husband's creditors.'</p>

<p>" 'Then let the law and my husband's creditors do their own
inhuman work,' said she; 'go back and, if you have any feeling
in your breast, do not aid in making us more miserable than you
have done already.  Don't delude yourself with the thought that
you will be pardoned for doing an inhuman act, on the plea of
doing your duty; it is not your duty to inflict misery upon us
who have never injured you.'</p>

<p>"There was a frightful wildness in my mother's manner
which terrified me, and caused my young brothers and sisters to
set up a dismal howling, in which I joined with all my might.
But the deputy sheriff was probably used to such scenes, for he
did not appear to be much moved by the distress he had caused.
On the contrary, he turned coolly to my father, whose proud and
haughty nature seemed to have been suddenly changed, and requested
him to hurry and make his preparations, for he had other
business to attend to.</p>

<p>" 'It is of no use to remonstrate, my love,' said my father;
'I must go, and leave you in God's care.'</p>

<p>"The Sheriff's officer said that he had his wagon at the door,
and if my father wished to take anything with him he might
bundle it in; he remarked that there were no beds in the jail
and as the weather was cold, my father had better have one.

<!-- Volume II, page 222 -->

The Law in its mercy had left us but two beds, and one of them
was brought down, and with a few old clothes, was carried out
and put into the Sheriff's wagon.  My father kissed us all, and
for the first time I saw him embrace my mother in a tender
manner; he wrapped himself in his cloak, and we followed him
to the door, and watched the wagon which bore him away until
he was lost in the distance.  The night was cold and stormy, the
wind howled dismally through the deserted street, and the snow
beat against the windows, and drifted through the cracks, and
under the doors, into our cheerless house.  I had never known
any of those tender feelings towards my father which I have
heard other children express, but I loved my father, and even
though it had given me no pain to see him dragged away like a
culprit under such dismaying circumstances, the distress of my
mother would have rendered me unhappy.  Let her have felt
towards him as she might, or have experienced harsh treatment
from him, she showed herself a true woman and a tender wife
in his calamity.  She shut the door after he had been taken
away, and drawing us into the only room which had any furniture
remaining in it, clasped us in her arms and wept in silence.
Good God! sir, what a world this is, that men should inflict such
miseries on each other!  I cannot help weeping now when I
remember the agonizing feelings that lacerated my young and
tender heart that night."</p>

<p>After pausing a few minutes the schoolmaster, for whom I
began to feel a strong liking, proceeded in his story as follows:</p>

<p>"At last my mother spoke and said, 'My darling children,
your father has been torn away from us, and we are left alone
in the world with nobody to help us; but do not cry, nor distress
me with your complaints.  God will take care of you, even if
your poor mother should be taken from you.  You must never
speak ill of your father, nor think ill of him, for if he has
brought ruin upon us by his conduct he did not mean to do it,
and he loves you all, and will be kind to you if he ever should
be set at liberty again.'  After this we all laid down together on

<!-- Volume II, page 223 -->

the only bed remaining to us, and, for my own part, I spent the
night in thinking of my father and imagining the dreadful sufferings
which he must endure in his imprisonment.  The next
morning my uncle called to see us, to offer assistance to my
mother, but she would receive nothing from him, but upbraided
him with being the cause of our misfortunes.  In process of
time our house and furniture, and even my pony that I loved
almost as well as my mother, were all sold to satisfy my father's
creditors, and we were compelled to remove into a by-street and
occupy a very small house; my father was liberated from confinement
by some of the processes of the law, but as his debts
hung over him like the sword of Damocles, he was prevented
from engaging in any business, and having never learned a
trade he soon sunk into the despised condition of a broken-down
gentleman, and scarcely subsisted by contracting small debts,
under false pretenses of one kind and another, until an event
happened which raised him above such small and shabby expedients,
but plunged us into the lowest depths of degradation.</p>

<p>"It was about a twelve month after the night I have described
on which my father was carried to jail, when, on a similar evening,
as I sat with my mother reading Mrs. Chapone's Letters,
for it was the only book in our house excepting the Bible, and I
had read it through two or three times for the want of something
better, when the door suddenly flew open and my father entered,
looking wild, pale, and with blood upon his face.  He was so
agitated that he could not speak until he had drank some liquor
which my mother reached him.  'Ask me no questions,' he then
said, 'take these things and put them away, and give me some
water.'  She brought him some water in a basin, with which he
washed his face and hands, and then threw the water into the fire
and burned the napkin which he had used in wiping his face.
'Now let me go to bed,' said he, 'and be sure, if anybody calls
for me, to say that I have been in bed since dark, sick.  He had
not, apparently, noticed my presence in the room until he was
about to leave it, when he said, 'what shall we do with this boy?'

<!-- Volume II, page 224 -->

And seizing me by the arm he shook me violently, and commanded
me, on the peril of my life, not to disclose a word that I
had heard nor to say what I had seen, and if I should ever be
questioned on any occasion, to say that he had been in bed, sick,
at dark.</p>

<p>"I looked imploringly to my mother, but she told me that I
must do as my father ordered, and followed him upstairs, carrying
with her the things which he had just brought in.  What
they were I could not plainly see, but I thought that there was a
pocket-book among them.  It happened that my little brothers
and sisters were all abed, and as we kept no servant then, I was
the sole witness to the evidences of what I suspected to be my
father's guilt."</p>

<p>"I hope," said I, "that you had the courage to resolve to tell
the truth, let what would happen."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I had not," replied the schoolmaster.  "I wish that I
had; but I was too much terrified to reflect, and only thought of
alleviating the troubles of my parents.  Besides, I had never
been educated in a love of truth, and had been too long accustomed
to the prevarications and dissimulations of my father and
mother, to feel any repugnance to uttering a deliberate falsehood.</p>

<p>"My mother had not been long absent when she returned to
me, and although I could see that she was alarmed at something,
and troubled in her mind, she tried to appear composed and unconcerned,
and made me sit down and go on with my reading
of Mrs. Chapone, whose dry moralities now seemed to me dryer
than ever.  When the wind rattled the door, she started and
trembled violently, and as she leaned upon me for support I was
frightened to feel the cold and clammy touch of her hand.  She
sat but a few minutes, when going to the cupboard she poured
out a glass of the liquor which she had given my father and
gulped it down, and soon after I began to discover its effects;
for she cried and laughed, and acted so strangely that I was
alarmed at her appearance, and begged her to let me light her
up to bed.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 225 -->

<p>"I was too old in the wickedness of the world not to know the
cause of my mother's actions, and to feel keenly the disgrace of
her conduct; but it was the first time I had ever witnessed anything
of the kind, and I attributed it to the pain and anxiety she
felt on account of my father.</p>

<p>"Now have I not told you enough already to justify me for
being mad, melancholy and misanthropic?  Ought I not, with
the recollection of events like these blackening every hour of
my life by their cursed shadows, to have committed suicide, and
put on end to my wretched existence?  But I have something
worse than this lingering in my memory, and gnawing into my
thoughts every hour of my life."</p>

<p>"If committing suicide would cleanse the character of your
parents, and give them a good standing in the world," said I,
"there might be some excuse in such an act; but as it would only
be adding to the disgraces of your family, it appears to me that
it would be better to live and redeem your character.  If there
can be any excuse for suicide it must be when the self-murderer
has brought disgrace upon himself, which he has too much honor
to bear.  But men of honorable feelings do not disgrace themselves
by their own acts, and, upon the whole, I do not see that
the suicide has any other excuse than that of madness.  However,
I do not think that you will commit suicide, because you
talk about it."</p>

<p>"Ah! you do not know me yet," continued the schoolmaster;
"it is not fear that holds, me back.  However, let me go on with
my story, or I shall detain you until it is too late to find a lodging
in the village.</p>

<p>"I retired to my bed on that dismal night, but not to rest, for
my mind had been so disturbed by the strange conduct of my
father, and the still more grievous conduct of my mother, that I
could not sleep, and when the cold grey light of morning began
to lighten up my dismal little chamber, which was scantily furnished
with conveniences, I crept shivering from my bed and
looked out upon the cheerless street which was filled with snow.

<!-- Volume II, page 226 -->

The wind moaned dismally through the naked trees, and the snow
beat heavily against the window of my room, but it was a relief
to me to look out into the day-light, I had been so long shut up
with my dark thoughts and undefined fears.  But I was not allowed
to remain long even in that state of dismal suspense, for I
shortly heard a loud knocking at the street door, and soon after
I heard my mother's voice shrieking as if in agony.  I hurried
on my clothes, and running down into the entry, soon learned the
cause of her distress.  The sheriff had again come to arrest my
father, but this time it was not for debt, but for a terrible crime.
God! how my head reeled with pain as I heard the charge
against him, and remembered the occurrences of the night before.
My uncle had been found in the street, badly wounded in
the head, insensible, and robbed of the valuables he was known
to have about him when he left his house.  There were tracks
in the snow, which, notwithstanding the snow that had fallen,
were traced from the place where he was found to the door of
my father's house, and they had come to arrest him on suspicion
of his having committed the horrid deed.  My mother behaved
as a wife always should under similar circumstances; she
shrieked with all her might, both at the calamity that had
befallen her brother and the charge laid to her husband.  She
fell upon her knees and vowed that he was innocent, and called
upon me to sustain her in the assertion that my father was in his
bed at the time the robbery was committed."</p>

<p>"And you did?" said I.</p>

<p>"I did.  I could not help it," he replied.</p>

<p>"You will never commit suicide," said I; "but never mind,
go on with your story."</p>

<p>"Yes, I perjured myself," continued the schoolmaster, "and,
following the example of my mother, fell upon my knees and
swore that my father was in his bed at dark.  The officers were
somewhat staggered, but they had no choice in the matter, and
begged my father not to think ill of them as they could not do
otherwise than arrest him.  As for my father, although he was

<!-- Volume II, page 227 -->

naturally of a violent temper, and easily excited, he was now
perfectly cool under the appalling accusation, and submitted without
any show of resistance to his arrest, merely remarking that
he was perfectly innocent and should have no difficulty in proving
an alibi.  But I saw very plainly that he was very far from
feeling at ease, he was very pale and seemed to labor hard to
appear unconcerned; turning to my mother he embraced her,
told her not to be distressed on his account as he would soon be
at liberty again; and he even took me in his arms and kissed
me, and while doing so, whispered in my ear to remember what
he had told me.  The officers were overcome by these tender
demonstrations and wiped their eyes, and as for myself, I was so
unused to anything like even an appearance of affection between
my parents that I could not help weeping.  The subdued manner
of my parents towards each other was like a gleam of sunshine
to me."</p>

<p>"And you felt no repugnance at the falsehood you swore
to?" said I.</p>

<p>"Truly, I did not; I had more serious thoughts in my mind,
and too many griefs in my heart to hesitate about telling a lie
when it was likely to relieve my unfortunate parents," said the
schoolmaster; "and I cannot say that I regret it now, for it was
the means of saving my father from the fate of a felon.  My
uncle was badly injured, but he fortunately recovered, and either
could not or would not give any very clear information as to the
person who had attacked him, and as both my mother and myself
swore on the trial that my father was in his bed at the time the
robbery was committed, he was found not guilty and returned to
his family worse in his feelings and more violent in his temper,
than ever.  Instead of manifesting any dread lest I should be
driven by his harshness to disclose my knowledge of his guilt,
he seemed to entertain a greater degree of hatred towards me
than ever, because he felt himself in my power.  I was now in
my fourteenth year, a wretched boy, with no companions but my
younger brothers and sisters to whom I was a kind of dry nurse,

<!-- Volume II, page 228 -->

being compelled to wait upon them when my mother was in a
condition, caused by her habit of resorting to the bottle for comfort
in her difficulties, which precluded her from attending to
their wants.  I had a thirst for learning, but was denied the
privilege which all New England boys enjoy of going to school;
I was growing up ignorance, and daily becoming familiarized
to immoralities by witnessing my father's habitual disregard of
truth and every moral obligation, when a change was produced
in our affairs by the death of my unfortunate mother who, having
drunk freely of her favorite liquor, one night in her attempt to
go into the cellar, fell down a trap door and was killed.  Ah!
there are some who can look back with melancholy satisfaction
to the death-beds of their parents, but I can never think of my
mother's death without, at the same time, thinking of the cause
of her death.  Thus you see I have nothing in the past upon
which I can look with pleasure, in the future nothing that
promises me happiness, and even for the present you see that I
am miserable enough."</p>

<p>"But are you going to stop them," said I; "pray what
happened to you after the death of your mother?"</p>

<p>"After that unfortunate event," continued the schoolmaster,
"my condition was bettered to a certain degree, for my father
left the village on the pretense of going in search of business,
and myself and my little brothers and sisters were placed in the
charge of a distant relation of my mother.  As I was old
enough to work I was told to look out for a place in which I could
earn my own living, and you will hardly believe me when I tell
you the various kinds of employment which I engaged in before
I fell upon that which I now earn my bread by, and which all
Yankees, at some period of their lives, I believe, have engaged
in.  At first I was put to a farmer, or rather I put myself to one,
who worked me as he did his oxen, and appeared to entertain
about the same degree of tenderness towards me, except that
he tried to fatten his oxen, and seemed to have quite an opposite
design upon me, for he was always complaining that I ate more

<!-- Volume II, page 229 -->

than I was worth.  His wife was of a similar way of thinking,
and as I was continually scolded, occasionally cuffed, often stinted
in my food and always overworked, I concluded after a few
months' trial to abandon agricultural pursuits and try my fortune
in one of the liberal professions.  Finding that the apothecary of
the village was in want of an assistant, I applied for the place,
and felt myself, if not the happiest of mortals, at least a very
lucky one, when I found myself stationed behind a counter with
the rays of two large goblets of green and purple liquid falling
like a glory about my head.</p>

<p>"It was purely delightful for a while to be placed in such
comfortable quarters, with an unlimited amount of liquorice root
at my command, and the privilege of tasting and smelling of all
manner of scents and extracts.  But delightful as this was at
first, I soon found that there were bitters as well as sweets even
in the liberal profession of drug-selling; after a while I lost all
relish for liquorice, the globes of green and purple water no
longer looked so beautiful as they did when seen at a distance,
and as I lived in my employer's family I discovered that, however
pleasant the apothecary might be, the apothecary's wife was
capable of administering doses which my pride would not permit
me to swallow.  She looked upon the shop as an appendage to
the house, and upon me in an especial manner as a convenience
designed expressly for her use by nature and circumstances.&mdash;While
my duties were confined to the galley pots and pestle and
mortar, I cared not how hard I worked, but the apothecary's
wife required me to attend to another description of pots, which
I would not submit to, and as she ruled her husband, I was
obliged to quit my pleasant situation, and give up all hopes of a
liberal profession before I had half learned the inscriptions on the
bottles and boxes on the shelves, or could tell the difference between
elixir pro. and borax.  Giving up all hopes of ever hearing
myself called a doctor, I left the apothecary's shop with my
little bundle of clothes, and with a dismal foreboding of misfortunes
to come, went the rounds of the village without finding a

<!-- Volume II, page 230 -->

place where I could obtain employment, when just as night was
coming on, I met the tavern-keeper, who asked me if wanted a
place, and engaged me for his bar-keeper.  Here I remained
nearly a year, and I might have fallen into such habits that I
could not in after life have broken away from them, had not a
clock pedler one night stopped at the tavern and offered to learn
me his trade if I would bind myself to him until I was twenty-one.</p>

<p>The offer of the clock pedler was very gratifying to me,
for it not only provided me an ingenious and genteel trade, but
would afford me an opportunity of seeing the world, of which I
had heard a good deal by listening to the stories told by the frequenters
of the bar-room.  I was beginning to be dissatisfied,
too, with the nature of my employment, and thought that I ought
to redeem the character of my family by striving after something
better than the post of a tavern-keeper.  As I had a little money
due me, my employer consented to my leaving him upon the condition
of forfeiting my wages, which I gladly consented to, and
the next day started with the pedler for the town where he lived,
which was in Connecticut, and entered at once upon my new
occupation.  But clockmaking did not agree with me; I had
no genius for mechanics, and my employer happened to be one
of those old-fashioned people who believe that knowledge
can be beaten into a boy's head.  He tried the experiment upon
me, and I ventured to show my disapproval of his method by returning
his blows, for I had got to be now quite stout, and as the
pedler was a rather small man, I had no great difficulty in getting
the better of him.  In short, I gave him a sound drubbing, and
left him to look after a business more congenial to my natural
taste, and an employer who had a different method of instructing
his pupils.  As I broke my contract by leaving him, of course I
got no money; but I had been so little accustomed to money that
I did not know the want of it, and felt no great uneasiness at
being once more thrust upon the world without a dollar in my
pocket.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 231 -->

<p>"I was not long in making the discovery, however, that money
was a prime requisite, and without it I had better be out of the
world than in it.  For some cause or other Yankees have a
keener perception of the value of money than other people, I believe,
and therefore are more acute in discovering the means of
obtaining it, and as I take pride in calling myself a genuine
Yankee, I am not ashamed to confess that I never felt the least
repugnance of following any honest occupation which offered me
a reasonable chance of making a penny; therefore, when I quitted
the clockmaker, I did not hesitate to accept a situation as a
hostler at a tavern, not because I had any peculiar liking for the
occupation, but because no other employment offered itself just at
that time.  This was, in truth, a fortunate change for me, or at
least it so seemed at the time, for I had not long been engaged in my
new situation when a travelling dentist having put up one night
at the tavern, was suddenly called upon to extract a tooth for the
wife of the tavern-keeper; the dentist's instrument happened to be
out of order, and as I had learned the use of tools while working
for the clockmaker, I offered to mend it, and succeeded so well
that the dentist looked upon me as a remarkable genius, not
knowing but that I had all my life been engaged in the care of
horses.  The next morning, as I was getting his horse for him,
he came privately and told me, that if I would leave my employer
and apprentice myself to him that he would make my
fortune for me.  I was but too happy to accept his offer, for I was
now weary of being confined to a stable with no better companions
than dumb beasts; but the profession of a dentist was a genteel
and money making business, and by learning it I might yet
hear myself called a doctor, which was the height of my ambition.
As I had not proved myself very expert in the stable the tavern-keeper
was willing to let me off before I had served him the time
I had agreed for, and the dentist furnished me with money to
travel by stage to his place of residence where he had a work-shop
for making teeth, when I was immediately set to work on
my arrival and quite astonished him by the readiness with which

<!-- Volume II, page 232 -->

I handled his tools, and, what he considered a display of natural
genius, in polishing metals.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for me, my mechanical genius did not develop
itself very rapidly under the tuition of the dentist, who one day
expressed his astonishment to me that I should have such an instinctive
knowledge of tools, and yet should be so dull at learning,
upon which I explained to him that my knowledge of tools and
mechanical skill were the results of a very painful and long apprenticeship
to a clockmaker.  Upon hearing this, the dentist
perceived that he had cheated himself, and immediately flew into
a furious passion and began to abuse me, and call me a great
number of bad names, which I did not deserve, to save himself
from self-reproach for his own stupidity in engaging me.  He
had bound himself to pay me a certain sum, yearly, until I was
twenty-one; but I scorned to compel any one to employ me who
undervalued my services, so I tore up my indentures, and receiving
the amount due me for the time I had been at work for
him, started once more in search of a business for which I was
designed by nature.  So far, I had learned something in each situation
I had held, and, if I knew nothing thoroughly, I had at
least a smattering of a good many trades.  The newspapers and
the miscellaneous books which I had lighted upon had given me
a little insight into literary matters, and a pocket dictionary and
one of Lindley Murray's grammars, which I had purchased, out
of my savings, enabled me to extend my knowledge of the rudiments
of grammar.  I was picking up some of the elements of
future success continually, and if it had not been for the recollection
of my unhappy childhood, and the fate of my poor parents,
I might have been happy; but, with such a gloomy
shadow resting upon my memory, I could not feel otherwise than
wretched.</p>

<p>"My first move, after leaving the dentist, was into the street,
where the stores were, and being unacquainted with anybody in
the town, excepting the dentist, I knew not where to go for assistance;
but, trusting to luck, I applied in succession to all the

<!-- Volume II, page 233 -->

stores for employments, and at last had the good luck to apply to
a dealer in dry goods and hardware, who happened to be in want
of an assistant.  He engaged me at a very small salary, and to
enable me to save the cost of a lodging, gave me permission to
sleep in a trundle-bed beneath the counter.  I had no objection
to this arrangement, and found myself at once installed in a very
comfortable position.  I was clerk in a store, and could dress
myself respectable and associate with genteel people.  I did not,
I must confess, make a very good salesman, for my employer
complained continually that I was not sharp enough with the
customers, and that I was too candid in giving my opinions of
the articles which were enquired for; besides these defects, I had
unluckily taken two bills of broken banks, and had once given
a four-pence-half-penny too much in making change.  I also
made another blunder, which was trifling in itself, having only
taken a smooth ten-cent piece for a nine-pence, which very nearly
resulted in the murder of my employer.</p>

<p>"He had a great fear of robbers and therefore furnished me
with a pistol, and told me if I ever heard anybody breaking into
the store to make good use of it.  One night just after I had crept
into my trundle-bed, and put out my light, I heard a fumbling
at the door accompanied by a noise which, in my alarm, I
thought was a summons to surrender.  So, without more ado, I
caught up my pistol, and aiming at the door fired it off and sent
the ball through one of the panels.  The supposed robber immediately
fled, and I was flattering myself that I should be applauded
in the morning for my courage, but when morning came I was
horror struck to learn that I had nearly killed my employer,
who had come down to the store the night before to ask me of
whom I had received the smooth nine-pence, with a cross upon it,
which he found among the contents of the till after going home.
The pistol ball had slightly wounded him in the arm, and although
he was nearly killed by fright he was not seriously injured,
and before long returned to business.  But this was not
the worst misfortune that befell him through my means.  I had

<!-- Volume II, page 234 -->

become possessed of a volume of Shakespeare, which so fascinated
me that I read it whenever I could find a leisure moment.  It
contained the plays of 'As You Like It,' 'Twelfth Night,'
'Much Ado About Nothing,' 'The Taming of the Shrew' and 'The
Merry Wives of Windsor.'  The perusal of these plays opened
a new world to me, and afforded me a degree of delight that I had
never dreamed of before.  I hugged the precious volume to my
heart and kissed it in my transports of pleasure; I placed it
under my pillow at night, and read it when I first opened my
eyes in the morning.  My daily duties grew tediously dry and
irksome to me; I longed for a world of romance and poetry, and
was only happy in the company of Orlando and Rosalind, and
thought all the wits and humorists of the village very stupid fellows
when compared with Sir Toby Belch, Touchstone, and
Falstaff.  My happy moments were after I had put up the shutters,
bolted the store door, and crept into my crib, where I used
to lie upon my back and read through my volume of enchantment
by the dim light of a tallow candle stuck upon the counter
above my head.</p>

<p>"As I was indulging myself one night in this manner I fell asleep
in the Forest of Arden while musing with the melancholy
Jacques, and soon after I was roused from my delightful vision
by a suffocating smoke which, at first, I thought was a fire in
the woods where I had been wandering in the company of Audrey
and Phebe.  But I soon discovered, to my consternation, that the
store was on fire, and by good luck I made my way to the door,
which I forced open and gave the alarm of fire.  But, it was too
late, the weather was cold, the only fire-engine in the village was
frozen up, and before the inhabitants could render the needed
assistance the store of my employer was consumed with all its
contents.</p>

<p>"A new misfortune now overtook me, for I was suspected of
the crime of having set my employer's store on fire, and to escape
imprisonment on a charge of arson, I was forced to run off
and assume another name."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 235 -->

<p>"This changing of names," I remarked to the schoolmaster,
"is an inconvenient way of getting rid of difficulties."</p>

<p>"So I found it, in the end," said the schoolmaster, "but I had
no other alternative but to go to prison, or to go off under an
alias, and of course I chose the latter course.  In escaping from
the store I had saved nothing but my clothes and my Shakespeare,
and without a cent in my pocket I once more started in
pursuit of fortune.  Probably you know nothing of the uncomfortable
feelings which a man experiences with a sharp appetite
and an empty pocket."</p>

<p>I assured the schoolmaster that I knew exactly what they
were.</p>

<p>"Ah! then I need not tell you what a harassing journey I
had, after I left the town in which my last disaster occurred, as I
tramped across the country, and had to stop at the doors of farm
houses and solicit the favor of a cup of water and a piece of
bread.  As night set in on the second day of my flight I was
overtaken by a hard shower of rain, and sought a shelter in a
blacksmith's shop.  The blacksmith told me that his son, upon
whom he depended for assistance in blowing the bellows and wielding
the sledge, had run off and left him to go to sea, and
that he was in great distress, in consequence of the want of help.
Here was an opening for me which I at once embraced, and
offered my services to the shoer of horses and repairer of cart
wheels.  I believe that he was more rejoiced to have me than I
was to obtain employment that would afford me a sustenance, and
immediately bargained with me for a term of two years, at the
end of which, he said, I might be master of my business if I
attended to it.  I do not think that nature ever designed me for a
blacksmith, but as she had failed to provide me with the employment
best calculated to develop my talents, I was forced to
frustrate her intentions, and enter upon a line of business not
congenial to my genius.  This last engagement, which promised
so badly in the beginning, was, in fact, the making of me.  In
my employer's parlor I found a complete edition of Shakespeare

<!-- Volume II, page 236 -->

in ten volumes, enriched with the notes of Pope, Malone and
Johnson, whose imperfect appreciation of the great poet, led me
to conceive the stupendous idea of elucidating him myself.  Was
it not a ridiculous thought in an untaught village blacksmith to
dream of elucidating Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"Why, since that Shakespeare himself was only an untaught
village wool-comber," said I, "it does not appear to me so very
ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Well, that is precisely the view of the matter which I took
myself," said the schoolmaster, "and so I set about the task.
I worked hard all day, and studied hard all night; and while
blowing at the bellows, laid out the plan of my lecture.  The
occupation of my hands did not much interfere with the occupation
of my thoughts, and while sweating and hammering at the
anvil, I do assure you that I had some of the sweetest visions
that ever visited a toiling mortal in this world.  The little smithy
was peopled with kings, fairies, and warriors, and there was not
a hob-nail in the shop that did not appear to me as bright as a
diamond.  It was well for me that I had to work hard, for, otherwise,
the intense abstraction of my thoughts might have
proved too much for my body.  Having filled myself with the
majestic and tender thoughts of Shakespeare, I was impatient to
reveal to the world the riches I had gathered.  I did not then
know what a world of books had been written on my favorite
subject, and supposed that the meagre notes of Johnson, Pope, and
Malone, were all that had been published.  But I soon
learned the truth, for it got noised about the country that I was
a miracle of learning, and people used to come into the smithy
to hear me talk Shakespeare.  The clergyman of the neighboring
village came to see me, and finding that I had Shakespeare
at the end of my tongue, asked me if I had studied Schlegel, and
Hazlitt, and Coleridge.  But I had never heard of these authors,
and the clergyman kindly loaned me their criticisms on my favorite
poet.  By reading them I added greatly to my ideas on
Shakespeare, and was confirmed in the determination I had

<!-- Volume II, page 237 -->

formed to lecture upon the subject of my studies.  I told the
clergyman of my determination and he encouraged me in the
attempt.</p>

<p>"Having made all my preparations, I announced my first lecture
at the Village Athen&aelig;um, for every village in New
England, you know, has its Athen&aelig;um, if it has nothing else,
and as I was now called the Shakespearian Blacksmith, and was
looked upon as little short of a miracle, I had a good audience,
and I may say without vanity that I amused them, if I did
nothing else, for as I had never had any experience in speaking
in public, and had acquired from using a sledge-hammer, a very
emphatic manner of enforcing my remarks, I believe I cut as
grotesque and ridiculous a figure as was ever seen in a rostrum.
My face was begrimed with soot, my clothes were ungainly and
old fashioned, my pronunciation was after a fashion of my own;
and altogether I think that my audience had sufficient cause for
the twitterings and grinnings which I could not fail to notice
among them.  I had about made up my mind to confine myself to
the anvil for the future, and to give up the plan of enlightening
the world with my lectures on Shakespeare, when the clergyman
who had at first encouraged me in the undertaking, now met me
as I descended from the reading desk, and told me that I had
mistaken my vocation, and had better stick to my trade, for he
could assure me as a friend that I should never succeed in lecturing.
My pride was touched by these remarks.  'So that is
your opinion of me, is it?' said I to him.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, my friend,' replied the clergyman, 'that's my candid
opinion of you, and I would advise you to think well of it.'</p>

<p>" 'I will advise you,' I replied, for I was very angry and excited
by the mortification of my reception by my first audience,
'to go and hang yourself.  I shall go on lecturing, and you will
be sorry for the advice you gave me, one of these days.'</p>

<p>"My resolution was now taken, and I gave the blacksmith
notice that I should quit him at the end of the month, for I had
not worked out my two years, and start on a Shakespearian lecture

<!-- Volume II, page 238 -->

tour.  The blacksmith was quite willing to get rid of me,
for he had begun to grow jealous of my reputation, and found
that I received more attention than himself from the visitors to
the smithy, and beyond that, I may say, with candor, that my
work did not give universal satisfaction to his customers.  Well,
to shorten my story, for I observe that the moon has begun to
descend towards the horizon, and the air is growing chilly, I
started on my lecturing tour, and the things which caused the
clergymen to predict my failure proved the cause of my
triumph.</p>

<p>"My ungainly manner, uncouth pronunciation, and disregard
of the courtesies of polished society, of which I knew nothing,
attracted the attention of the public, and I was run after by the
learned and polite as a kind of intellectual monster.  The singularity
of a lecture on Shakespeare by a person of my appearance
was so attractive, that I believe I excited as much attention
among the literary circles where I appeared, as even the learned
pig had done.  As I made money by my lectures, and understood
the secret of my attractions, of course I took no pains to
reform my manner, or to correct my peculiarities of speech; but
in spite of myself, I either conformed insensibly to the way of
the world in which I now moved, or the world grew weary of
my eccentricities, for I found that my audiences began to grow
less and less, and I could detect a greater number of yawns
among my hearers than I had at first noticed."</p>

<p>"This is always the way with every novelty that is not intrinsically
excellent," said I; "if, instead of depending upon
your coarseness of manners, you had taken pains to cultivate
your mind, and conformed to nature in your speaking, your popularity
would not so soon have worn out."</p>

<p>"Of course it would not," replied the schoolmaster, "and
feeling the truth of your remarks, I saw the mistake I had made in
seeking after a temporary reputation by the arts of the charlatan,
and immediately set myself to work to rectify my error.  I could
no longer lecture on Shakespeare, for, in addition to my other

<!-- Volume II, page 239 -->

misfortunes, it was discovered that I had borrowed a thought occasionally,
from Schlegel and Coleridge, and I was unjustly
accused of borrowing from Hazlitt and Lamb, of which I was
never guilty.  I was also accused of quackery, and fell more
rapidly than I had risen.</p>

<p>"Those who had once run after me in the height of my popularity,
deserted me just as I was beginning to prove myself entitled
to their respect; and, if I had ever allowed myself to be deceived
by the adulations of my professed admirers, who attached themselves
to me for the purpose of sharing in my reputation, I should
have felt bitterly disappointed at the defection.  But I never had
any faith in my own greatness after I had been able to compare
myself with the other laborers in the great Shakespearian field;
I knew the secret of the excitement which my appearance before
the world had created, and felt neither disappointment nor revenge
when the bubble burst upon which I had been so luckily
borne up into the regions of popular favor."</p>

<p>"In other words," said I, "like other quacks, you did not believe
in the virtues of your prescriptions."</p>

<p>"Not exactly that," replied the schoolmaster, "I never gave
currency to opinions which I did not honestly believe, but I knew
they were not original ones.</p>

<p>"However, if I lost my reputation, I had prudently kept the
money which it brought me while I enjoyed it, and I resolved to
lay out my capital so as to promote my future interests, for I had
now become convinced that money was essential to my comforts.
I must confess that I was embarrassed to choose a profession
which was adapted to my genius, and, at the same time, profitable."</p>

<p>"And you chose that of a schoolmaster?" I observed.</p>

<p>"I did no such foolish thing as that," he replied, "but you
will learn presently how it happened that I fell into that business.
As for trade, I knew my inefficiency at a bargain too well to
think of the mercantile profession, and for farming I had an unconquerable
aversion; I thought awhile of the bar, but with all

<!-- Volume II, page 240 -->

my desires to distinguish myself and make a fortune, I could not
resolve to sell myself to defend rogues and villains for a fee.  I
could not descend to the chicanery and low arts of the law.  I
had no genius for mechanics, and as for physic I had too great
an aversion to it to think of making my living by administering
it to others.  There was but one door open to me, and that was
the church."</p>

<p>"The church!" I exclaimed; "surely, you did not think of
entering the ministry with any such mercenary motives?  The
church!  Why, what call had you to that sacred profession,
which none are suffered to enter who have not a divine intimation
that their services are needed."</p>

<p>"I must confess that the church was not exactly to my mind,"
continued the schoolmaster, "but, as there was nothing else remaining
for me, what was I to do?  Besides, I had acquired a
love of public speaking, while I was delivering my lectures, and
there was no other way in which I could so well indulge in it
as by going into the pulpit.  It is the only profession, too, which
covers its members with a shield of superstitious reverence, for
in all other callings men must depend upon their own merits for
respect; but, in the church they are saved from that necessity,
and depend upon their profession.  Their cloth is their protection;
their vocation is sanctified, and it is, moreover, the only
calling in which a man may beg without dishonor."</p>

<p>"Those are all powerful inducements to a lazy man without
principle, I confess," I said, "but it appears to me that an honorable
man would prefer entering a profession which would require
individual exertion to insure the respect of mankind.  The dignity
which has no deeper foundation than the color of your coat,
cannot be very gratifying to the pride of an honest man."</p>

<p>"There is some truth in your remarks, I allow," said the
schoolmaster, "but I have great respect for the opinions of the
world, and they decide the matter the other way.  The Indian,
that worships with reverential awe the ugly idol that his own
hands have fashioned, is not less sincere in his devotions than the

<!-- Volume II, page 241 -->

lover of art who worships the ideal beauty which he finds in a
Greek statue; therefore, if your object be to gain reverence, you
had better be an Indian idol than an Apollo Belvedere.  What
I wanted was the reverence of the world, and therefore I determined
upon the church."</p>

<p>"You were right, then, in doing so," said I, "but, for my own
part, I would not give a fig for the reverence of the world if I
could not first reverence myself."</p>

<p>"For that matter, neither would I," said the schoolmaster,
"but I can always continue to keep on good terms with myself;
or, at least, I have never yet had any difficulty that way.  Well,
having made up my mind to enter the church, the next question
with me was, what church shall I enter?"</p>

<p>"I can well conceive your embarrassment," said I.</p>

<p>"It was the most puzzling choice of my life," said the schoolmaster;
"however, I had only to look at the different churches
soon to determine where I should most surely find the objects
which I desired, and I resolved upon the Episcopal church, with
the thoughts of a bishop's gown in my mind, and as there happened
then to be two parties in the church, I had another difficulty
in deciding on the party with which I would take sides.&mdash;Here
again, by keeping the great end in view of my own individual
advancement, I had only to look after the wealth and
power of the church to determine where the path lay which led
to preferment, and I chose the side of conservatism and the
traditional usages of Episcopacy, for it was there that the power
of the church had been derived."</p>

<p>"You are making a precious confession to me," said I, "and,
perhaps, you had better understand that you are causing me to
entertain a very contemptible opinion of your character.&mdash;Although
I am not a member of the church, yet I hold in
detestation the man who can be guilty of the baseness of entering
the sacred office of the preacher from such base motives as those
you acknowledge."</p>

<p>"You are very candid, sir, and I respect you for it; but I have

<!-- Volume II, page 242 -->

undertaken to tell you the cause of my misfortunes and miseries,
and therefore I have honestly stated to you my motives in entering
the church, and before I am done you will see what a miserable
wretch I am, and how excusable it would be in me, if I were to
carry my design into execution and throw myself into the river
with my pockets full of stones.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "I resolved to enter the ministry of the
Episcopalian church, and to take sides with the extreme conservatives,
and made known my wishes to a well-known Puseyite
preacher by whom I was well received and encouraged to persevere.
As I had sufficient money to defray the expenses of my
education by living prudently, I entered at once upon my studies,
and adopted the priestly dress which was worn at that time by
the students in the high church party.  By studying hard I was
enabled to present myself for admission to deacon's orders at a
much earlier period than I had at first anticipated, and passed my
examination with credit.  In the course of my studies I had some
misgivings as to the wisdom of my choice of a profession; in
making it, I had looked only at the fortunate members who
preached in fine churches, enjoyed large salaries, and were honored
for their talents; but I discovered that these were only the
high prizes of the lottery in which I had invested my fortune,
there was a melancholy army of priests who had to struggle hard
for a precarious living, many of them were often without
churches to preach in, some had to go off on missions to unhealthy
places to labor among the poor and ignorant, and many
more had to resort to the painful occupation of school keeping,
being debarred, by their ordination vows, from engaging in any
more worldly pursuits."</p>

<p>"Very sad, indeed," said I, "must it be for them, if their hard
lot is not sweetened by the consciousness of obeying a divine command
in their ill-paid employments."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the schoolmaster, "I have felt that bitterness,
and know what it is.  On preaching my very first sermon, I had
made a mistake in putting on a black gown.  I found that lecturing

<!-- Volume II, page 243 -->

on a subject in which I was at full liberty to give vent to
all my thoughts and convictions was a very different thing from
preaching a prescribed set of doctrinal rules.  I felt myself that
my heart was not in my work, and I heard some of the people
complain of a want of reaction in my manner.  The formalities
of the service I could discharge well enough, but when it came
to the preaching I was found wanting; the people were not satisfied
with an elegant essay on religious matters, read in a becoming
manner, they wanted to be warmed up in their feelings and I
had no warmth to impart to them.</p>

<p>"I preached from church to church, but I received no invitation
to settle, and at last I was forced to confess to myself that I
had been self-defrauded of three years' valuable time, which I
had spent in acquiring information that would yield me nothing
in return.  As my money was all spent, I was obliged to look
after some means of support besides preaching, which, as yet,
had not produced me a dollar.  The vision of a new Gothic
church, with a comfortable parsonage attached, which had floated
before my eyes during the whole term of my preparatory studies,
now vanished, and left nothing better behind than a country
school house&mdash;the last resort of poor devils like myself, who,
after being at great pains to prepare themselves for the post
of an instructor of men, have to descend to that of an instructor
of children.  Although it was not disgraceful in a clergyman to
beg, I found that it was not considered necessary, always, for
laymen to give; and in the end, I had to accept the best place I
could find as an humble country schoolmaster.  Yes, I, who entered
the church thinking of a bishop's gown, was driven by
sheer poverty to become a schoolmaster in this small village.&mdash;But,
even here, where I have well nigh grown crazy by thinking
of my disappointments, and the unhappiness of my boyhood, I
have experienced a new affliction from the scorn and contempt
with which that darling creature has treated me since she discovered
my love for her."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p>WHILE listening to the long story of the schoolmaster's misfortunes,
I had been sitting on the ground, and did not perceive that
the night dews were falling heavily, and nearly saturating my
clothes.  The grass had become very damp, and as I attempted
to shift my position, a pain shot through my limbs, so acute and
sudden, that I could not help crying out from the agony it
caused.  The moon had sunk to the horizon, and the air had become
chilly, so that I trembled with the cold.  On attempting to
rise, for the purpose of exercising myself to set my blood in
motion and gain some heat, I found that I was unable to stand,
and another acute pain darted through my limbs, and nearly deprived
me of breath.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was terrified at first, but I told him that he
must give up his projected suicide until he had taken me upon
his back and carried me to a tavern where I could be put into a
warm bed.</p>

<p>By this time the moon had disappeared beneath the horizon,
clouds had been gathering overhead, and the night was very
cold; to add to my distress a cold north wind had sprung up
which swept heavily across the fields and seemed to be laden
with icicles, it sent such a chill through me as it whistled past.&mdash;My
pains increased to such a degree of intensity that I could not
help roaring with the agony I suffered.  The village, or rather
the tavern in it, was but a short distance off, the schoolmaster
assured me, but there were no lights to be seen, and I could not
have found my way to it alone.  The schoolmaster offered to
leave me and go in search of a physician, but, I caught hold of
his legs and told him that he must not desert me, for I was
fearful of lockjaw, and thought I should die before any assistance
could be procured if I were left alone; and then the thought
occurred to me that he had conceived the idea of walking off
and leaving me to die there, so that he should be rid of a rival in
the affections of the Lost Pleiad.  But I believe now that I did

<!-- Volume II, page 245 -->

him a wrong, for he evinced no disposition to leave me; but, on
the contrary, I fancied that my agonized cries gave him a kind of
pleasure.  I told him that he must take me upon his shoulders
and carry me to the tavern, for it was impossible for me to walk,
and any delay, I felt, would be fatal to me.  I was heavier than
the schoolmaster, but he courageously took me in his arms, and
occasionally dropping me to rest, at last succeeded in reaching
the tavern; and placing me upon a bench on the piazza, he
rapped upon the door, and after a long while, which to me
seemed a thousand years, he was answered by the landlord in
person, who shoved up a window in the second story, and poking
his head partly out, demanded who was there, and what we
wanted.</p>

<p>"It is I," replied the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Who the devil is I;" growled the landlord, "and what do
you want at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?  I am Mr. Gossitt," replied the schoolmaster,
"and I have got a sick man here who was taken ill on
the road."</p>

<p>"What! is it you, schoolmaster?" cried the landlord, "ain't
you ashamed of yourself to be cutting up your pranks at this
time of night?  Go home and go to bed, or I will throw a
bucket full of cold water over you."  And, with these words,
the window was shut down, and the surly landlord disappeared.</p>

<p>"What shall I do now?" exclaimed the schoolmaster; "he is
one of the most disobliging men in the vicinity; moreover, he
hates me because I once delivered a temperance lecture here,
which caused some of his customers to give up the habit of
drinking.</p>

<p>"Make him open the window again," said I, "and I will persuade
him to take me in for I shall die if I am left here in this
cold air."</p>

<p>"I know it's of no use," said the schoolmaster, "but I will
try, to please you."

<p>So he began again to thump upon the door, and while he was

<!-- Volume II, page 246 -->

rattling away by shaking the handle, the window above his head
was softly raised, and the landlord suddenly thrusting himself
half out, exclaimed, "if you are so fond of cold water as you pretend
to be, take that and make the most of it," and at the same
moment emptied a tub of water upon the schoolmaster, which
completely drenched him.  The poor wretch gasped for breath,
and it was several minutes before he could sufficiently recover
himself to give vent to a round of imprecations which bestowed
upon the landlord's head, forgetting his priestly character in
his anger.  He was now in reality in as bad a condition as myself,
and violently trembled with the cold.</p>

<p>"What shall be done now?" he exclaimed; "we cannot get
in here, and there is not another public house.  If we remain
here exposed to this penetrating air, we shall both be dead before
morning."</p>

<p>"That would not be of so much consequence to you," said I,
"as you have been contemplating suicide; but for me it would
never do; I cannot think of submitting to such a fate.  There is
but one thing left for us, you must carry me immediately to the
cottage of the Lost Pleiad, and there we shall be sure of shelter
and a kind reception."</p>

<p>"You would be sure of a kind reception, but they would not
receive me," said the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Do but get me there, and I will insure you a welcome," said
I.  And the assurance had the desired effect upon him, for, although
he trembled so that he could hardly stand upon his feet,
he at once consented to my proposition, and taking me upon his
back he staggered off towards the cottage of the Lost Pleiad, and
before he reached there, he had got himself into so profuse a sweat,
that it was probably the means of saving him from a fit of chills
and fever, to which the people in that neighborhood were then
much given.  He did not carry me at one stretch, but sat down
to rest, and, as my pains passed off now and then I was able to
hobble along by only resting upon his shoulders.  But he had a
hard load to carry, and was nearly exhausted before he reached

<!-- Volume II, page 247 -->

the cottage of Mrs. Swayne; and for my own part, my pains had
increased to that degree, and I felt so weak and weary that I
could scarcely articulate a word.</p>

<p>In truth, from experiencing a chilliness that nearly benumbed
my faculties and caused my jaws to chatter so that I could with
difficulty make the schoolmaster comprehend what I said, I had
suddenly passed into an opposite condition, and when he placed
me on the sill of the cottage door I was in a burning fever, and
my brain seemed to be on fire.  I was dying for a drop of cold
water and motioned to the schoolmaster to hasten and wake up
the family, that I might obtain relief.</p>

<p>The poor devil was almost as incapable of moving himself as
I was, but he exerted himself to the utmost, and having first
rapped with his knuckles on the door, he began to throw pebbles
up against the window of the room where he supposed that Mrs.
Swayne and Sylvia slept.  But it was a long time before any response
was given to the schoolmaster's shouts and knocks.  At
last the upper window was raised a little, and a trembling voice,
which I recognized as Mrs. Swayne's, called out, "Who's
there?"</p>

<p>"It's I," said the schoolmaster; "come down quick, and let
your Master Thomas and me in, for he is sick and in distress."</p>

<p>"For shame of you, Mr. Gossitt," now exclaimed Mrs.
Swayne, as she put her head out of the window; "for shame of
you, to come here and disturb two lone and unprotected women,
in the middle of the night.  I never heard anythink so wicked
before.  Go home, and let us alone, Mr. Gossitt; do now, that's
a good soul, for poor Sylvia is frightened out of her wits with
your wicked doings."</p>

<p>"My good woman; my dear madam; I beg&mdash;&mdash;" but it
was no use for Mr. Gossitt to beg anything of the good woman,
for she shut down the window and left him to shout in vain.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, now?" said the schoolmaster, coming to me
and taking my hand; "she won't let us in, and if you lie there
you will die before morning."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 248 -->

<p>I could only say, "Try again.  Tell her it is I who need assistance,
and she will come down and open the door."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster again began to throw up pebbles against the
window, and to shout for Mrs. Swayne to come and open the
door, and again the window was raised, and Mrs. Swayne thrust
out her head, and in an angry voice told Mr. Gossitt if he knew
what was good for himself he had better be quiet.</p>

<p>"O! you unfeeling and most barbarous woman!" exclaimed
the schoolmaster; "will you have one of your dearest friends
expire at your own door for the want of a drop of water?  If you
will not let him in, at least open your door and give him some
drink."</p>

<p>"O! if it's water that you want," said Mrs. Swayne, "you
shall have a plenty of that, Mr. Gossitt; come a little closer
under the window, if you please."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster unsuspectingly did as Mrs. Swayne requested,
and stepped close under the window, thinking that
she intended to lower something down to him, but the old
lady suddenly caught up a pitcher of water and dashed its
contents upon his head.</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Gossitt, take that and go home," said the exasperated
Mrs. Swayne, "and don't come here to disturb me and
Sylvia again."</p>

<p>Wretchedly as I felt, and unable to move myself, I could not
help laughing to hear the groans and denunciations of the poor
wretch, who was now in nearly as bad a condition as myself.&mdash;Mrs.
Swayne laughed loudly herself, at first, and kept telling
him to go home, and go to bed; but at last she seemed to understand
something about his allusions to me, and she said, "Pray,
Mr. Gossitt, what do you mean by talking about Master Thomas?
He is not here; he has gone to the tavern to sleep."</p>

<p>"Ah! you unfeeling woman," he exclaimed; "have I not
been telling you all the time that he is here, and suffering, too?"</p>

<p>"I say he is not&mdash;is he, Sylvia?" said Mrs. Swayne, turning
her head to appeal to the Lost Pleiad.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 249 -->

<p>"No, no; truly, he is not here," exclaimed the soft, sweet
voice of Sylvia, but, without putting her head out of the window.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear me! did ever anybody hear of stupidity like
that!" exclaimed the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"It's you that's stupid," said Mrs. Swayne, "so go home and
take somethink to keep you from getting cold."</p>

<p>Mrs. Swayne was about to shut the window, when, mustering
all my strength I groaned, in the hope of attracting her attention.</p>

<p>"Good gracious 'evans!" said she, "what was that I heard,
Mr. Gossitt?"</p>

<p>"That was your Master Thomas, who is lying at your door,
dying for the want of assistance," said the schoolmaster, "and
you have been barbarously denying that he was here."</p>

<p>"Master Thomas here?" exclaimed the good woman; "O!
'evans!  I will be there in a minute."</p>

<p>The window was suddenly shut down, and presently a light
was discovered moving about; the prospect of relief had the effect
to cheer me, and I felt better.</p>

<p>"I do believe that the cackling old hen has come to her senses
at last," said the schoolmaster, "and she means to take us in.&mdash;Yes,
she is coming, and I believe that the Lost Pleiad is coming
with her too, for I hear two pair of feet on the stairs.  Ah! they
would have seen me lie here and perish first; see how they rush
to your assistance."</p>

<p>"The door was now thrown open, and Mrs. Swayne, accompanied
by Sylvia, made her appearance with a light in her hand.&mdash;They
were both dressed without much regard to appearance, the
mother being carefully wrapped up with a shawl over her head,
while the daughter, in her haste had drawn something over her
shoulders, the appearance of a flannel gown.</p>

<p>"Why Master Thomas!" exclaimed the old lady, as she held
the light in my face, "what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I am very ill, Mrs. Swayne," I gasped out, "but give me
some water, I beg of you.  I am burning up with an inward fever."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me who it was with you, Mr. Gossitt?"

<!-- Volume II, page 250 -->

said the old lady, turning to the schoolmaster, who stood shivering
with cold.  But, without waiting for a reply, she ran off to
bring me some water, while, by the aid of Sylvia and the
schoolmaster, I made out to get inside the house and fell helpless
upon the floor.  A glass of cool water was refreshing to me for
a moment or two, but I was soon seized with another fit of freezing
ague, and called for blankets as earnestly as I had before
done for cold water.</p>

<p>They got me to bed after a while, and the schoolmaster was
sent for a physician, who did not arrive until day light, when
he bled me until I fainted, and then left some medicines, which
were administered to me as soon as I revived.  What became
of the schoolmaster, or what happened afterwards during the
following week I know not, for, either owing to the improper
treatment of my disorder by the physician, or from some other
cause, I sank into a state of delirium, from which I did not recover
in all that time.  My mind was not inert during these
weary nights and days, but was busy with horrible visions which
even now make me shudder when I think of them; sleeping or
waking the monstrous distortions of my fevered fancy filled my
brain and gave me no rest from my wretchedness.  I was either
burning in a lake of smolten lead, or lying in some damp, cold
dungeon, with shapeless monsters crawling over me with their slimy
limbs, and glaring into my very soul with their hideous
green eyes.</p>

<p>It is a terrible thing to be sick; to lie all day upon a fevered
bed, and to hear the sounds of life and merriment without; to
see the shadows of birds, as they flit past your window; to hear
the joyous shouts of children, and the harsher voices of sturdy
laborers as they pass to their appointed work; to know that
while you lie weak and helpless, the victim of a wasting disease,
the world is as full of sweetness and beauty as ever, but that
you are debarred from tasting or enjoying any of its pleasures;
to know that flowers are blooming, that the water sparkles
in the sun, that the clouds float in the blue ether as they did

<!-- Volume II, page 251 -->

when you too were free from pain; and that everything is happy
and free from wretchedness but yourself.  But the night is more
wearisome than the day, for then all nature is still, and the
drowsy world is hushed in sleep, while you toss upon your bed,
listening to the dull sounds of droning flies, or the thick breath
of the heavy sleepers around you.  The night-lamp placed in a
corner emits a sickly light, and casts long and dull shadows upon
the walls of your room; the chairs and tables become fearful
objects, and by gazing steadily at the furniture of your apartment
it becomes imbued with a dull life which seems to be a
part of your own; the atmosphere grows oppressive, and your
mind wanders back to the days of hilarious health, when you
were free from pain and suffering, and breathed the pure sweet
air, and ran at will over the fields, or wandered by the sea-shore;
the ticking of your watch becomes fearfully distinct, and
seems to be measuring out to you the weary moments you have
to live and suffer.  You turn, and turn, and turn again, trying
to find some spot on your heated bed which will afford you but
a moment's ease, but you turn in vain; the night hours drag
slowly along, and you think that morning with its cold light will
never come.  But worse than all, the evil that you have done
comes back in frightful distinctness to oppress you; all your follies
revisit you, and the good that you might have done, the opportunities
for improvement which you have lost, the friends you
have offended, the wealth you have wasted and the health you
have set lightly by&mdash;all rush into your thoughts, and you wonder
how things that you had forgotten for years should again
come back to you as though they had been the occurrences of
yesterday; if you doze, it is but to have exaggerated dreams of
your distresses, and you wake to the realities of your pain, and
fear to sleep again, and dread to remain awake; you envy the
droning fly that buzzes about your ears, and wonder why he
does not make his way through the crack in the window to the
free air instead of bumping his head against the wall above your
bed; and the mouse that creeps into the room, encouraged by

<!-- Volume II, page 252 -->

the stillness and deadness of everything around you, to pick up
the crumbs which you have dropped from your bedside, appears
to you a happy creature, and to be envied.</p>

<p>All these experiences I realized in a more distressing manner
than I can describe, while I lay sick in the best room of Mrs.
Swayne's cottage, my sole visitors being the good old lady herself,
the Lost Pleiad, the doctor, and the schoolmaster.  The
schoolmaster would have remained with me all the time if he had
been permitted, merely for the sake of being near the object of
his adoration, and now and then having the pleasure of being
spoken to by her.  Whether or not I received any benefits from
the visits of the doctor, I could not exactly tell, but I suspect that
I got well in spite of him, rather than in consequence of his prescriptions.
The schoolmaster, I have no doubt, put up prayers
hourly for my release from all earthly suffering, but I was perfectly
safe from all harm from him, otherwise; for he knew that
his only way to gain the affection of the Lost Pleiad was to treat
me with tender care, and that any lack of attention to my wants
would gain her instant displeasure, and an expulsion from the
cottage.  But the ministering angel of my sick bed was the Lost
Pleiad herself, who watched over me with the tenderest care, anticipated
all my wishes, and soothed me by her gentle attentions.
One of the things which I remember with the greatest pleasure
was her bathing my head in cool rose water, when my brain
seemed on fire and my skull ready to crack from the bursting
pressure within.  Dipping her hand in the basin of cool and fragrant
water, she would pass it gently over my forehead, softly
and soothingly, until gradually the pain would diminish, the fiery
pressure would cease, and I would sink into a refreshing slumber,
always productive of pleasant dreams, and wake to find her
still carefully watching by my side.</p>

<p>I had been lying ill three weeks, and had just begun to gain a
little strength so that I could sit up and look out of the window
for a few minutes to refresh myself by a sight of the beautiful
and unchanged view from the cottage, which embraced a good

<!-- Volume II, page 253 -->

many objects of tranquillizing aspect, when it occurred to me that
Mrs. Swayne must have been put to great straits to provide the
necessaries for me out of her slender income.</p>

<p>"Sylvia," said I&mdash;for the Lost Pleiad was sitting by my side,
and pointing out to me the particular points in the landscape
which she thought would interest me&mdash;"has not your mother been
put to great inconvenience by my unlooked for presence here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she would have spent her time in some useless
work, if you had not come," said Sylvia, "and I am sure she
takes pleasure in waiting on you, for she loves you very much."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt her love, Sylvia, nor yours"&mdash;Sylvia blushed
and turned her head&mdash;"I mean your good will, Sylvia, and your
readiness to serve me as you would anybody in distress, but
what I mean is, has she not been compelled to spend more than
was convenient for her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! no!" exclaimed Sylvia; "there has been no
lack of money; there has been plenty of it.  I never heard my
mother complain that she had not a plenty.  She has had more
then she wanted."</p>

<p>"That is a relief to me," I replied, "for I have feared that
her small income would not be enough to meet the new demands
upon her purse, which my sickness has created.  But when I
get well enough to write, Sylvia, I can send to New York, and
get money enough to repay both her and you for your goodness."</p>

<p>Sylvia looked me full in the face with a look which seemed to
say, "What, do you mean to offer <i>me</i> money for my services."</p>

<p>"I do not mean to <i>pay you</i>, Sylvia, because that I could not do
with money; I only meant that your mother should be amply
compensated for all the expense she may have incurred on my
account, and that if money can be any recompense, even to you,
that it shall, at least, be a proof of my gratitude."</p>

<p>"If you have any money in New York," replied Sylvia, turning
her head away, "you had better keep it there; and as for my
mother, she has been well repaid already.  She will never accept
anything from you, be assured.  But let us not talk about

<!-- Volume II, page 254 -->

pay and money, but look out of the window and enjoy the prospect
you were admiring.  Does not the river look beautifully
blue through those elms?"</p>

<p>"I will look at the river by-and-by, Sylvia; but tell me first,
by whom has your mother been repaid, or do you mean that she
has been repaid by her own good heart?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do not ask me any more questions, if you please," replied
Sylvia; "such talk will only do you harm, and, perhaps,
bring on a fresh attack of your disease."</p>

<p>"No, no, Sylvia," said I, taking her hand, and involuntarily
pressing it; "you must not keep anything secret from me; you
and I must not be guilty of double dealing; we are too old and
too good friends for that.  You must be sincere and candid, and
tell me what you meant when you said that your mother had
been repaid.  I must know."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you more, now; I am under a pledge; so do
not ask me again.  You know I would not deceive you."</p>

<p>I was determined to know more, for the manner of Sylvia,
rather than her words, had excited my curiosity; for I saw that
there was something in her thoughts which she had unconsciously
let slip.  But, unfortunately, just at that moment the schoolmaster
tapped at the door, and Sylvia seized upon the occasion
to leave me alone with him.  I was provoked at the interruption,
but was too feeble to be angry.</p>

<p>"You will soon be well," said the schoolmaster, as he threw
himself upon my bed, for Mr. Gossitt had a way of making himself
at home anywhere, not appearing to have any idea of individuality
in property, except in regard to that which he possessed
himself,&mdash;and, by the way, as I have got into a digression, I may
as well observe that this feeling of partnership in other people's
goods, according to his own confession, manifested itself pretty
strongly in his Shakespearian lectures, wherein he appropriated
to his own use whatever he had the good luck to find to his liking
in Schlegel, Coleridge, and Hazlitt.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You will soon be well again," said the schoolmaster, as he

<!-- Volume II, page 255 -->

doubled up one of the pillows of my bed to enable him to talk
with the greater ease, as he lay stretched upon my mattress;
"and then I suppose I shall no longer have the privilege of paying
a daily visit here?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," I replied.</p>

<p>"Which do you hope?" said he.</p>

<p>"That I shall soon be well," I replied, "for you may be sure
that I have no objections to your daily visits here."</p>

<p>"Ah! you haven't," said he; "well, perhaps the reason is,
that when you go you mean to take the Lost Pleiad with you?"</p>

<p>"I mean to do nothing of the kind," said I, "for Sylvia
would not go with me if I were disposed to take her; and I have
already told you that I am positively engaged to be married to
another.  I could not violate my word."</p>

<p>"Lovers' oaths," said the schoolmaster, "are made to be
broken."</p>

<p>"But I am a man as well as a lover," I replied to him, "and
I cannot break my word."</p>

<p>"But suppose your word had not been passed, how then would
it be with you and the Lost Pleiad?" said he.</p>

<p>"To save yourself from a worse reply, Mr. Gossitt," said I,
"don't take offence if I tell you, now, that your question is impertinent."</p>

<p>"Oh!  You think it is?  Well, I wanted to know how it
would be, for private reasons of my own, or I would not have
asked," said the schoolmaster; "however, if you are particular
about it, I will not press the matter, of course; but I could tell
you something about the Lost Pleiad and her mother, which
might interest you."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to know anything," I replied, "which they
are not willing to tell me themselves.  However, as you have
hinted at something that exists which I should know, you had
better tell it; for, in my weak state, I cannot afford to be annoyed
by suspicions.  Out with it, if you please."</p>

<p>"You would think it impertinent in me, I dare say, if you

<!-- Volume II, page 256 -->

knew; and so I rather think it will be the better way for me to
shut up, and say nothing."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that the schoolmaster might know something
about the money hinted at by Sylvia, which her mother had received.
"Pray, tell me, Mr. Gossitt," said I, "if I have been
visited by any one except yourself and the doctor, since I have
been sick?"</p>

<p>"Well, the clergyman has been here and prayed with you
about a dozen times, and I am not sure but his prayers have
done you more good than the doctor's pills."</p>

<p>"You are a buffoon," said I angrily, "to make light of so serious
a matter as my illness.  I knew that the clergyman had
been here; he made me a long prayer that morning, or rather,
I should say, he made a long prayer for me.  But are you sure
there has been no one else here?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say I am sure there has <i>not</i> been anybody else
here," said the schoolmaster, with a most provokingly meaning
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Can't you say, then, that there has been somebody else
here?"  I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I could; but it might be considered in impertinent
in me to do so,&mdash;and, upon the whole, I think I shall throw
myself upon my reserved rights, and refuse to answer any impertinent
questions whatever."</p>

<p>I was by this time completely wearied out, and so vexed at
the provoking replies of the schoolmaster, that I had to request
him to rise from my bed so that I could lie upon it myself.  The
schoolmaster assisted me to lie down but refused to tell me anything
more satisfactory than what I had already been able to sift
out of him.  But I was quite sure, from what he and Sylvia
said, that something had happened respecting me which, for some
reason that I could not guess at, they had resolved that I should
not know.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Bassett been informed of my situation, and paid me
a stealthy visit?  Nothing was more likely; yet, if he had

<!-- Volume II, page 257 -->

come at all why should his arrival have been kept secret from
me?  It could not have been he.  Could it have been old Gil?
would he have been at the trouble in come and see me?&mdash;clearly
not.  Who then could it have been?  A sudden thought occurred
to me, which should have suggested itself at first.  Who
was there so likely to visit me as Pauline herself.  It must have
been she, and I could readily understand why she would desire
that her visit should be unknown to me.  It was so like her to
come, but it was not so very much like her to leave without my
seeing her. My heart warmed towards her anew at the thought
of her tender regard for me.</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing, Mr. Gossitt," said I; "was it a woman
who visited me while I was so very sick and insensible?"</p>

<p>"You have been visited daily by women," said he, "and I
should not mind being sick myself to have such nurses as you
have had since you have been lying there."</p>

<p>"I know that I have been visited by Sylvia and her mother,"
said I, "but has there not been a young lady here to look upon
me while I lay insensible?"</p>

<p>"There may have been dozens of them for aught that I could
swear to the contrary; you know that my own visits have been
short; for the Lost Pleiad seems always to regard me as an intruder
when I come into your room.  I believe in my soul that
she looks upon you as a piece of her own private property, and
that nobody has any right, even to save your life, but herself."</p>

<p>These perplexing replies of the schoolmaster made me feel
quite confident that Pauline had actually been to see me, and the
thought revived in my heart all the tender feelings which I had
before entertained towards her, and which had been almost obliterated
by the constant, modest, and sincere attentions of Sylvia,
who was as unlike Pauline as it was possible for a young lady
of the same age to be.</p>

<p>"I am right, am I not, Mr. Gossitt," said I, once more appealing
to the schoolmaster, "in believing that a young lady has
visited me from New York?  To be candid with you, I suspect

<!-- Volume II, page 258 -->

that the lady to whom I have already told you I am engaged to
be married has been here?"</p>

<p>"You have a great idea of your personal attractions, Mr.
Pepper.  You will pardon me for saying so, but really, I think
that such an object as you have been for the past ten days, is
not exactly what I should think powerful enough to attract a
young lady all the way from New York.  I don't wish to hurt
your self-esteem, Mr. Pepper, but really, as you are fond of candor,
I might as well tell you what I think about the matter."</p>

<p>It was very clear that the schoolmaster had made up his mind
to foil my curiosity, and that he took pleasure in seeing me annoyed;
so, shutting my eyes, and pointing to the door, I requested
him to leave me.</p>

<p>"Well, I will go if you wish," said he, "but before I do go I
will merely mention to you that somebody has been here to see
you, who seemed to feel a tolerable degree of interest in you; but
whether it was man, woman, or child, I cannot exactly say just
now, as you are in a hurry for me to go."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster put his hand upon the latch as though he
was willing to be recalled, but I would not gratify him, although
I was in a high fever already from thinking over his words, and
trying to determine who it was that had visited me since I had
been sick.</p>

<p>"Well, I am going," said the schoolmaster; "have you
nothing more to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied, "but that I can wait to learn from some
one else the secret which you might have disclosed to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may tell you yet," said he.</p>

<p>"I will not hear it from you," I said; "so go and leave me.
I prefer not to know from you.  I shall know all in good time, if
it be right that I should.  So leave me to myself."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster, finding that he could no longer tantalize
me, reluctantly withdrew, and left me to ruminate on the puzzling
information which he had given me.  I was soon in a high
fever from the mere effect of curiosity, and if Mrs.  Swayne had

<!-- Volume II, page 259 -->

not very soon after come in to ask if I needed any thing, I might
have fallen into a relapse.</p>

<p>"Why, Master Thomas!" exclaimed the good old soul as she
entered my room, "what can be the matter with you?  Somethink
has happened, I know; your cheeks are so flushed."</p>

<p>"Nothing has happened to me, Mrs. Swayne," I replied, "but
I am excited by something that I have heard."</p>

<p>"Goodness! Master Thomas; I hope it wasn't a death-watch,
nor nothink of that sort?" exclaimed the old lady, lifting up her
hands.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Swayne, it was nothing of that sort that has disturbed
me; I should not be frightened by Death himself, much
less by any ticking of death watches.  I am not superstitious."</p>

<p>"O, don't talk in that awful manner about death, Master
Thomas; I am sure I never before heard anythink like it in my
life.  Poor boy, I am afraid your head is affected; let me bathe
it in this cool rose water."</p>

<p>"No, no, Mrs. Swayne; that could do my head no good," I
said; "but, if you wish to help me, and relieve me from the
fever which I now feel, tell me who has been here to see me
since I have been ill, and while I was insensible to everything
around me."</p>

<p>"O, my!" exclaimed Mrs. Swayne, changing color; "why,
you know, of course, who has been here. There has been the
doctor"&mdash;&mdash;

<p>"Fie! fie! I know that," I cried.</p>

<p>"Well, there has been the minister"&mdash;&mdash;

<p>"The minister!" I exclaimed, pettishly; "the devil take him,
Mrs. Swayne.  Do not tell me what I know already.  Tell me
who has been here to see me whom I have not seen."</p>

<p>"Now, Master Thomas, you must not say such wicked things
about the minister; after his praying with you so many times in
such a beautiful manner."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it, Mrs. Swayne.  But you vex me by these
evasive replies.  You deceive me.  I can see it in your looks.

<!-- Volume II, page 260 -->

You are not candid with me.  You are dishonest.  You, and
Sylvia, and the schoolmaster, are all leagued together to deceive
me.  I must quit here and go where there is more honesty."</p>

<p>"O, Master Thomas! you will break my heart by such
talk!" cried the old lady throwing herself upon my neck, and
bursting into tears.  "How can you say such things to me after
I have loved you so well?"</p>

<p>I was touched to the heart by the old soul's appeal, but I could
not help seeing that her grief was more than half of it a pretext
to turn my thoughts in another direction, and get rid of answering
my questions.  But I was determined not to be foiled, for the
more anxiety they had all manifested to avoid my questions, the
more intense was my curiosity to know what it was that so
nearly concerned me, and yet was so studiously kept from me.</p>

<p>"It is no use, mother," said I, wiping the old creature's eyes,
"to attempt to evade my questions.  I am now certain that somebody
has been here, and I must know who it was, and for what
purpose I was visited.  Come, tell me at once, and save me from
any further anxiety."</p>

<p>"O! Master Thomas, do you think I would keep anythink
from you that would do you good to know?  You know I wouldn't
do any such think as that, Master Thomas.  Would I, darlink?"</p>

<p>"Who has been giving you money, for my sake: tell me
that?" I said sternly, and suddenly changing the drift of my
conversation; "come, that I have a right to know, and I must
know."</p>

<p>"Why, Master Thomas!" exclaimed the old lady, "what has
put such a think as that into your head.  Bless your heart, you
are getting wild; you must have some sleep."</p>

<p>"Ah! Mrs. Swayne," I replied; "this is not the way to be
honest, and frank, and truthful.  You are all expecting that I
shall be pure and sincere, and yet you are all deceiving me and
playing me false."</p>

<p>"O! Master Thomas!  I have never deceived you, I am sure.
I have told you nothing that is not true," said she.

<!-- Volume II, page 261 -->

<p>"Ah! but you have not told me the whole truth," said I;
"you hide things from me which I should know.  And, if you
do not tell me an untruth, you do me as great a wrong by suppressing
the truth, which I have a right to know."</p>

<p>"You know I love you too well, Master Thomas, to do anythink
in the world to distress you; and as for doing you a wrong, O,
'evans!  Master Thomas, do you suppose I could ever do such a
think as that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do not think that you could intentionally injure
me, Mrs. Swayne," I replied; "you and Sylvia have both given me
too many proofs of your regard for me to think of such a
thing; but I see from what you, and she, and the schoolmaster
say, that some person has been here to visit me, and given you
money for me, and that for some reason you desire to keep it a
secret from me.  But I must know.  I shall go mad again if you
do not tell me."</p>

<p>"Wait until morning, Master Thomas," said Mrs. Swayne,
"and then, perhaps, you shall know all about it.  Be quiet until
then, and you shall know, dear soul, who it was; for, since you
have found out so much, I will tell you, Master Thomas, that
somebody has been here, who loves you better than I do, but I
cannot tell you now who it is.  Sleep quietly until morning, and
then I may tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," I replied; "I know enough.&mdash;And
now leave me to my dreams, Mrs. Swayne.  I shall sleep
better."</p>

<p>The good old soul having first put the room in order, and readjusted
my pillow, went out and left me to my own thoughts,
which were tranquillizing and pleasant.</p>

<p>I had no doubt now that it was Pauline who had come to see
me, and that it was her generous devotion to me which had
caused her to pay Mrs. Swayne for the expenses incurred by
sickness.  I could well understand the delicacy of feeling which
had imposed secrecy upon Mrs. Swayne in respect to my affectionate
visitor, although it was not strictly in accordance with

<!-- Volume II, page 262 -->

her impulsive nature to keep herself out of sight.  That it was
she, I had no doubt, and I reproached myself for having forgotten
her while I was waited upon by the tender and modest Sylvia.
I will confess, now, that I had at times doubted the constancy
of Pauline's love, for there seemed to be something selfish
in it, not withstanding its boisterous intensity, so unlike the tender
and modest affection of Sylvia.  It was flattering to my pride
that Pauline should so readily and without remorse desert her
father and mother to follow me; but there was a want of principle
in the act which made me suspect that one who could so
easily forget her duty and love to her parents, might by-and-by
be equally wanting in duty to me, when her love should cool
towards me, and the novelty of her situation wear off.  And then
her suspicious liaison with my old enemy, Mr. Barton, had given
me a good deal of uneasiness, and her strange conduct in consenting
to marry him and then running away from him with me,
had perplexed me not a little.  It was very clear that Pauline
was a mere creature of impulse, and that when I was out of her
sight her love for me was not powerful enough to resist a new
temptation.  Since I had been lying sick at the house of Mrs.
Swayne, and had watched the constant assiduity of Sylvia, who
seemed to take pleasure in enduring fatigue for my sake, and
who was wholly devoid of all appearance of selfishness in her
affection, I had insensibly fallen into a habit of saying to myself,
"how differently Pauline would have acted under such circumstances!"
And then, as to the beauty of the two: the modest
simplicity and retiring manner of Sylvia gave to her lovely face
a charm which I had never found in Pauline. In fact, I had
almost fallen in love with Sylvia, and forgotten Pauline, when the
thought that she had visited me by stealth in my helplessness,
revived afresh my love for that fascinating young lady, who exercised
an influence over me which I found it impossible to
resist.</p>

<p>Under the pleasing reflections that I had been thus visited, and
comforting myself with the thought of there being so many good

<!-- Volume II, page 263 -->

and loveable people constantly watching over me, and striving to
promote my happiness, I had nearly fallen asleep, when it occurred
to me that if it were Pauline who came to visit me, the
schoolmaster would have had no fears of my taking the Lost
Pleiad with me when I should leave the cottage.  This was a
new cause of perplexity to me, and after wearying myself with
conjectures a long while, and getting more feverish than ever, I
at last sunk into sleep, and was lost to Pauline and Sylvia and all
the rest of the world in whom I felt an interest.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

</div>

<p>HOW long I had slept, I know not, but I was awakened from
my slumber by a whispering near my bed side.  I did
not open my eyes, and discovering immediately that there was a
stranger in the room, I feigned to be asleep in the hope of discovering
who it was; but the whispering was so low that I could
not distinguish the natural voices of the speakers, excepting that
of Mrs. Swayne's, whose peculiarities of pronunciation betrayed
her.</p>

<p>It did not occur to me at the time, that I was departing from
my rule of strict honesty, by feigning to be asleep, and thus imposing
upon others;&mdash;such is the difficulty in this world of
deceits and false appearances, where falsehood begets falsehood,
of being perfectly true and sincere, let you try ever so hard to
be honest.  But the trial is worth making, and, from my own
experience, I can assure my readers, that the habit of sincerity
will so grow upon one by practice, that in time telling the truth
will get to be as "easy as lying," which is so easy as to have
become proverbial.  I wish I could impress upon some of my
young readers, and old ones too, the importance to themselves,
of being candid, sincere, and perfectly truthful, even in the
smallest matters.  I am persuaded that no one who once tries

<!-- Volume II, page 264 -->

the experiment, will ever regret it, and the probability is that
the advantages and pleasures of such a course will be so apparent,
that, truthfulness of conduct will be cultivated as a mere
matter of worldly policy.  Cunning may sometimes gain a point
which Truth could not, but Truth in the end must come out the
gainer.  As the whole history of mankind does not contain one
single instance of prosperous falsehood, whether in public, or
private life, there is nothing more surprising than that every
kind of deceit and duplicity should not be banished at once
from the world.  We make a terrible outcry because we have
discovered the power of steam and electricity, but, until the
world discovers so palpable a thing as the power of Truth, it
had better not boast too much about its patent discoveries.  The
phenomenon of a perfectly truthful man, would, no doubt,
attract the attention of mankind, and it is a matter of surprise
that none of the multitude who are striving to become famous
do not adopt this very simple method of attaining to notoriety.
All that we know about Diogenes is his candor, and yet he is as
well known as Alexander.  A cheaper way of becoming immortal
could not be hit upon, than to be truthful.  But I am
digressing from my narrative, although not from my plan, which
has been to show the value of sincerity as exemplified in my
own experience.</p>

<p>To go on with my narrative.  Such was my anxiety to know
who my visitor was, and the object of visiting me, that I forgot
all my previous resolutions, and continued with my eyes shut,
and breathing low as if I were still in a profound sleep.</p>

<p>There was a slight pause in the conversation as I heard them
approach nearer by bedside, and it was with great difficulty
that I continued to keep up the appearance of being asleep.  I
felt the light shine in my face as Mrs. Swayne held the lamp
above my head.</p>

<p>"He is sound as a roach," whispered the old lady; "he
sleeps better than he did."</p>

<p>"The fever has left him, and he is so feeble that he will sleep

<!-- Volume II, page 265 -->

soundly through the night;" replied another voice, in a low
whisper, which I recognized as that of the doctor who had attended
me.</p>

<p>There was another long pause which was at last broken by a
sigh.  I had a great desire to open my eyes and see who it was
that had sighed, but I wished to hear what further might be
said.</p>

<p>"Is he past all danger, Doctor?" whispered the stranger, feelingly.</p>

<p>"If he should be kept perfectly quiet, he will recover," replied
the doctor; "but it is all important that his mind be kept free
from excitement."</p>

<p>Had I, then, been so ill, as to be considered even now in danger?
The thought of my unconscious peril gave me a start
which betrayed itself in my face.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" said Mrs. Swayne.  "He is waking.  Go
out, for 'evan's sake, quick."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes to catch a glimpse of my unknown visitor
but only saw the retreating forms of two men.  I raised myself
in bed, but the motion alarmed them and the light was instantly
extinguished.  I was wide awake at once, and, from a sudden
impulse leaped from the bed and rushed towards the door, determined
to know who it was that had visited me.</p>

<p>"Good 'evans!" shrieked Mrs. Swayne.  "He is running
after you.  He will take his death."</p>

<p>The two men had ran as far as the door, and, in another moment
would have been beyond my reach; for Mrs. Swayne had
taken hold of me to prevent me from proceeding further.</p>

<p>"Help! help!" she cried.</p>

<p>The Doctor stopped.  The stranger's hand was upon the door
which was partly open; he turned his head to look back, and all
the light in the entry streamed in upon his countenance, I recognized
the face and form of Captain St. Hugh!</p>

<p>My bed-room was not so large but that I could easily gain the
door without assistance, although only a moment before I hardly

<!-- Volume II, page 266 -->

felt strong enough to stand on my feet alone; I should, probably,
have succeeded in catching hold of my unknown visitors, had not
Mrs. Swayne seized hold of my arms and checked me for a moment.</p>

<p>"Let me go, woman!" I said, fiercely; which so startled her
that she released me, and I pursued my unknown visitors into
the street; but, they had got entirely beyond my reach, and I
fell exhausted upon the wet grass, for it had been raining during
the day, and the air was still damp and chilly.  There I lay,
completely exhausted and unable to rise, until Mrs. Swayne and
Sylvia came running to my assistance and helped me back to my
chamber.</p>

<p>The two women were greatly alarmed at my imprudent exposure
of myself, and, without paying any attention to my expostulations,
fairly forced me upon the bed again, and covered me
over with blankets.  In truth, I was nearly as helpless as an
infant, and felt myself incapable of making any resistance.  I
had been very sick, and my physician had done his best
to second the disease which had attacked me, by drawing
out of my veins all the blood that he could.  He was
one of the regular bleeders; and it was not his fault that I was
not made a ghost of.  The good soul who waited on me so patiently
and faithfully during my illness, has often frightened me since,
by telling me how frequently the doctor tapped my veins, and
what monstrous doses of medicines he administered to me.
"And only to think of it," would she say: "so hobstinate was
your disease that all the bleeding and physic couldn't break it."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a miracle that he didn't kill the disease and the
patient with it; but, happily, I had a strong constitution which
resisted everything short of poison, and I recovered; but not until
I had been again reduced so low that even the doctor gave up all
hopes of my recovery, and all who felt any interest in my welfare
looked upon me as lost.  My second illness was brought on by
my rash exposure, and during many dreary weeks I lay scarcely
conscious of existence, except from suffering.  I was not neglected

<!-- Volume II, page 267 -->

in my helplessness; but I had no recollection on recovering
my health of seeing any one near me but Sylvia and her
mother, who were constant in their attentions, and untiring in
their efforts to gratify all my wishes.  It is not to be wondered
at that men fall in love with their nurses, and marry them when
they get well, for surely a woman never appears so much like
an angel as when attending upon your bedside.  It is then her
hour of triumph; she feels her power and wins your love by her
tenderness and assiduity.  As for myself, I experienced each
day a stronger and tenderer attachment for Sylvia, and a more
grateful feeling for her mother; for what motive could have induced
them to sacrifice so many of their own comforts to increase
mine, but the most disinterested affection. As the chances had
been altogether against my recovery, they had no reason to anticipate
any recompense for their trouble, and, even if I should
recover, they knew that I could never know how much they had
suffered for my sake, for I was insensible of their efforts in my
behalf when they were doing the most.  I felt ashamed and
humbled within myself, to reflect that I owed so much to these
kind hearted women, for whom I had never done the least thing
to entitle me to their gratitude; and when I asked myself if I
would have done as much for them, I was forced to confess to
myself that I would not.  I should have been undeserving the
name of a man if I had not felt the strongest gratitude towards
them, and swore to myself that I would sacrifice even my life for
their sakes.  I was satisfied that Pauline had not visited me; for
she surely would not have allowed me to remain ignorant of the
fact; if she had, it was not like her.  I began to regret that I
had ever promised to marry her, for I was forced to confess that
Sylvia was not only as beautiful in person, but infinitely more
lovely in mind, and more loveable in temper.  It would be but
a mere matter of justice, even though my desires did not prompt
me to the act, to offer her the life she had preserved, if she would
condescend to accept it in payment of the debt I owed her.  But
my word was passed to Pauline, and I would not break it; I

<!-- Volume II, page 268 -->

must marry her, and I felt impatient to go out that I might redeem
my pledge to her; but, in conformity with my resolution
not to be guilty of any duplicity, I was resolved to tell her the
exact state of my feelings.  Sylvia, too, should know how I felt
towards her, for I would not have that angelic creature remain
ignorant of my gratitude for her services.  I was amusing myself
with such thoughts as these as I lay upon my bed one morning
soon after I began to get well, when Sylvia entered my room,
looking, as I thought, more charming and innocent than I had
ever seen her before.  She had been out in the garden, which
must have suffered sadly by her neglect during my illness, and
had brought me in a bouquet of pinks and geranium blossoms.
She put them upon my pillow, but instead of taking them up I
caught hold of her hand and pressed it to my lips, for it seemed
to me infinitely more beautiful than the flowers.  In truth, Sylvia
had the loveliest hand in the world, and if the world thinks that it
was only my fondness for her that made it appear so in my eyes,
it will be enough, to refute such an opinion, to mention the circumstance
well known to many of her friends, that some years
after the event just named, the celebrated amateur Sculptor,
Mr. Stoutleigh, begged the privilege of modelling it for his famous
statue of Pocahontas.  No doubt many of my readers will remember
the fact, and also that the hand of that statue, which is
at present in the lyceum of the Sculptor's native town, has always
been considered, by connoisseurs, its finest feature.</p>

<p>Sylvia did not appear the least angry at the liberty I took with
her hand, but she immediately drew it beyond my reach, and
looked into my face as if to discover whether it were a mere act
of gallantry or affection, that prompted me to do such a thing.
She must have been satisfied that it was something a more than
gallantry, for she blushed very red, and said&mdash;"I did not offer
you my hand, Tom, but the flowers."</p>

<p>"But, I would rather have your hand, darling," said I; "and
as I know you wanted to please me, I took it.  But you are not
offended?"

<!-- Volume II, page 269 -->

<p>"If I am, I shall get over it," she replied, and sat down, and
pulled out a newspaper from her little work-basket.  "Are you
strong enough this morning, Tom, to hear a piece of bad
news?"</p>

<p>"Is my father dead?" I cried.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, with an alarmed look; for her question
threw me into such an excitement that I leaped up involuntarily,
forgetful of her presence, and but for her reply, would have
jumped from the bed.  I sank back, and she said&mdash;"it is the
death of some person you little think to hear of."</p>

<p>"It is Pauline?" she shook her head.</p>

<p>"Ah! then!" I exclaimed, "it is my first and best friend;
my almost father, whom I loved so well, Mr. Bassett.  Is he
then dead?"</p>

<p>"No, 'tis not Mr. Bassett," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I care not who it is, then, for I have no other friends
whose loss I should mourn," I replied.

<p>"It is somebody you care more for, and love better, than either
of them;" she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> a ghost?" I cried, half frightened, lest she should
prove one, and that it should be herself of whom she spoke.  She
smiled and blushed again, by which I knew she was no ghost,
and the death she alluded to was not one that I should be likely to
weep over.  But I was perplexed to know who it was for whom
she thought I cared so much; and she, seeing my curiosity
awakened, tried to excite me still more by her enigmatical talk.
I named over all my old acquaintances&mdash;Sophia Ruby, Mrs.
Bassett, Desire Goodwill, and even Mr. Ferocious, for whom I
had never been aware of experiencing any very great admiration
or tender sympathy.  But it was none of these.</p>

<p>"Poor Tom," she said at last; I will not tantalize you any
longer.  Do you know that you have been very sick?"</p>

<p>"Too well," I replied, "for your sake, and mine."</p>

<p>"Not for mine," she said.  "But you did not know that your
sickness was fatal, and that you died more than ten days ago?

<!-- Volume II, page 270 -->

Yes, Tom," she continued, as she opened the newspaper she had
taken from her basket; "if there be any truth in newspapers
you are a dead man; and here is the melancholy intelligence in
the Amboy Times, from which it was copied into all the city
papers."</p>

<p>"Let me see," I said; and taking the paper from her hands,
I read under the obituary head the following notice:</p>

<p>"Died, in this town, on Sunday the 13th inst., at the house of
&mdash;&mdash; Swayne, Esq., Mr. Tom Pepper, in the 20th year of his age.
Mr. Pepper was a native of Massachusetts, but was a descendant
of a noble English family; and, if he had lived, we understand,
he would have been Lord St. Hugh.  The writer of this knew
him well, and loved him for his virtues and his learning, and
deeply sympathizes with his afflicted friends and relations.

<p>"None knew him but to love him, nor named him but to praise."</p>

<p>"Whose work was this?" said I, blushing at the ironical
praise bestowed upon me.</p>

<p>"It was the schoolmaster's," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"The villain!" I exclaimed; "what could be his motive for
perpetrating such a piece of stupidity?"</p>

<p>"Don't blame him for speaking well of you," said Sylvia;
"they all do so after a man is dead.  And as for spreading the
news of your death before it happened, the fault must rest with
my mother, who, you know, would never do you any harm."</p>

<p>"And he never named me but to praise," said I; "I dare say
he never praised me for anything but dying, if he thought I was
dead.  The rogue wished me dead fifty times, and for your sake,
too, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"The poor man is crazy, I believe," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"But tell me all about the advertisement of my death,"
said I, "and why your mother should have done such a
thing?"</p>

<p>"It was when you lay just hovering between life and death,"
said Sylvia, "and we were expecting your breath, which was so
low and faint that it could scarce be perceived, would cease altogether;

<!-- Volume II, page 271 -->

the doctor said that you would go off at the turn of the
tide.  The schoolmaster, who used to call every day to enquire
if you were still alive, stopped at the door and found my mother
weeping.  'What, is he dead?' asked the schoolmaster.  'No,'
said my mother, 'he is not dead yet, but he will not live until
morning.  The doctor has given him up, when the tide turns he
will be no more!'  So the schoolmaster, who loves to tell fresh
news, hurried off to the printing office and wrote the notice of your
death, which you have just read, and it was printed the next
morning.  The schoolmaster called to offer his services at your
funeral&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And was very much disappointed, I dare say," added I, "to
hear they were not needed&mdash;was he not, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"O! I would be very sorry to think so ill of poor Mr. Gossitt,"
said Sylvia; "but he did not show quite so much joy on
hearing the good news, as my mother did in telling it, I must
say.  But poor Mr. Gossitt must not be blamed for what he does;
the poor man is not right in his mind."</p>

<p>"And did nobody else come to assist at my funeral?" I asked.</p>

<p>"O! yes!" said Sylvia, "the minister came, and so did the
sexton."</p>

<p>"Were they all?"</p>

<p>"O, no, not quite all.  Some of the neighbors also came in;
and everybody was very good; so that my mother said, there was
no knowing who our friends were until we died and had no need
of their services."</p>

<p>"Yet, none of these were my friends, Sylvia.  Did not the publication
of my death bring some of those who had been my friends?
Or did they stay away because I no longer had need of their
services."</p>

<p>"You have talked too long, already," replied Sylvia, "so ask
me no more questions.  When you get better I will tell you more."</p>

<p>"I will ask you but one more question, Sylvia, if you will answer
that truly.  Did Pauline come when the news of my death
was published, to see me buried.?"

<!-- Volume II, page 272 -->

<p>Sylvia cast down her eyes, blushed and answered, "no."</p>

<p>"No!  But she has been here, Sylvia, if not then?" I said.</p>

<p>"You promised to ask but one question more, and now you
have asked another.  If I answer that, you will want to know
more, and more, and the doctor will scold me for talking to you;
and my mother will be angry with me; and you will be sick
again, Tom.  So, promise me that this shall be the last question
you put to me, before I answer it."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Tom, the young lady you named has never been
here;" said Sylvia.  And as she said it, she raised her eyes
and looked me full in the face, as if she would watch the effect
of her answer upon my feelings.</p>

<p>"Then she deserts me in my sickness," said I; "I thought
she had been here and you would not tell me.  And yet she professed
to love me, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"And you loved her," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are betrothed.  I am pledged to her, and must marry
her."</p>

<p>"Must!" said Sylvia.  "Surely the young lady would not have
you upon compulsion.  Must is not the right word for lovers; I
should think if it were I, I must not have anybody who must
have me."</p>

<p>"I must not have you, Sylvia, then," said I, "not because I
must have you; but because I must not.  But this is musty talk
for us.  You know, Sylvia, that I have made a vow to be truthful
and frank, and to speak my real thoughts; so I cannot be guilty of
duplicity towards you, and keep from you the thoughts I have
had about you."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

</div>

<p>I WAS prevented from making a confession to Sylvia of the
state of my feelings towards her, by the entrance of her mother
and the doctor, who motioned her to withdraw when they came

<!-- Volume II, page 273 -->

in, and I saw her no more until the next morning.  The doctor,
who was one of those men that try to look wise, but, like most
men who try to seem better than they are, only appeared very
foolish, was, on this occasion, unusually important and solemn
in his actions.  He looked at my tongue, and lifted up his eye-brows;
he placed his hand upon my forehead, and pursed up
his mouth; he looked at his watch, and shook his head; and,
upon being asked by Mrs. Swayne what he thought of it, he took
out his pocket handkerchief and blew his nose before he replied,
that he thought my symptoms were favorable, rather than otherwise.</p>

<p>"He is very much as my husband was once," said Mrs.
Swayne; "only Swine was more, what do-you-call-it, in the face,
and sweated like everythink."</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied the doctor, as he knitted his brows
closely together as if to contract some great thought which was
growing too expansive for his head.  "Very likely, madam."</p>

<p>"Do you think he can come in now?" said Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>This question of Mrs. Swayne's started the blood in my veins,
and my heart began to throb violently.  "O! yes," I cried;
"let him come in&mdash;let him come in, by all means.  It will relieve
me to see him.  I shall feel better after I have seen him!" for I
had no doubt that it was my mysterious visitor who was the
person alluded to.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited, my young friend," said the doctor, taking
hold of my hand; "we must always be prepared for unexpected
events in this world; it is a world of changes, and a man of my
time of life, who was seen so much of human nature, of course,
expects these things."</p>

<p>"What things?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, the vicissitudes and changes of life," remarked the
doctor, "as well as of death."</p>

<p>"I am prepared for anything," I replied; "and if I am not
as old as you are, doctor, perhaps I have seen as much of human
nature, and experienced as many vicissitudes."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 274 -->

<p>The doctor smiled incredulously, and was going to say something,
or at least was making his customary preparations, when
I told him that if anybody was waiting to see me, I was perfectly
prepared to meet him, and that the delay to introduce him would
cause me more harm, from my excited feelings, than could possibly
result from any surprise which his appearance might occasion.</p>

<p>"I think Master Thomas is right," said Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at his watch again, and said, "Perhaps,
madam, you are right, or, at least, not far wrong.  I will withdraw,
and request him to step in."</p>

<p>The doctor did withdraw himself, but not in so abrupt a manner
as I wished; for he felt of my pulse again, and again looked as
wise and as important as he could by such facial man&oelig;uvrings
as he was in the habit of making his features undergo.  He withdrew
at last, but Mrs. Swayne remained, and presently another
person softly insinuated himself into the room and stood mournfully
by my bed side.  I looked up at my visitor, and saw at a
glance that he was not the one who had visited me before, and of
whose person I had caught but a glimpse.  That was a short person,
but this was a slender and shadowy man, with his head
hanging on one side as if there were nothing to support it.  As the
gentleman did not seem inclined to speak, but stood looking at me
in a dreadfully gloomy and desponding manner, I observed that
he wore a very scant and threadbare black cloak, with a little
cape that scarcely covered his shoulders, narrow as they were;
the cloak was scant in width only, for it was long enough to drag
upon the ground, and the bottom of it had a very rusty look from
the clots of red clay which it had caught up in the course of its
travels.  The rest of his garments were of corresponding quality
and fashion, and he wore, as a matter of course, a limpsey and
yellowish white cravat.  His face was thin and sallow, his hair
lank and light colored, and his hands long, thin, and white.</p>

<p>"This is not the gentleman who has been to see me before in
my sickness?" said I to Mrs. Swayne.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 275 -->

<p>"No, my friend," said the gentleman, in a sad and droning
voice, "I, ah, am not, ah, that person you, ah, allude to.  I, ah, am
another person.  Perhaps, I, ah, may say I, ah, am quite another
person."</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Thomas," said Mrs. Swayne, "he is, I assure
you, quite another person; but, I believe, Master Thomas, a very
good person, in which you may have confidence."</p>

<p>"I think, ah, my friend, you had better go out, and leave me
alone, ah, with the young man," said my visitor, turning to Mrs.
Swayne.</p>

<p>"If you please, I will," replied Mrs. Swayne; "but don't be
alarmed at anythink, Master Thomas," said the good soul, as she
went out.</p>

<p>What was there to be alarmed at, and what in the world had
that dismal apparition appeared to me for!</p>

<p>"Perhaps you, ah, know who I am?" queried the gentleman,
as he carefully placed his hat under my bed, and sat down by me.</p>

<p>"No, I do not," I replied.  "I have never seen you before,
I am certain.  Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am, ah, professor Willbore," snuffled, rather than said, my
visitor; "I am, ah, a preacher of the gospel, and, ah, professor of
dentistry."</p>

<p>"And pray, tell me, professor, in which character you visit
me now?" said I; "for I am as little in need of your services
in one as the other."</p>

<p>"I have, ah, no doubt you think so;" replied the professor, in
the same dismal whine; "but, I ah, have often seen men whose
souls, ah, needed cleaning, ah, as much as, ah, their teeth, who
ah, did not know it."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, professor," said I; "my molars are perfectly
sound, I know; but, as to my morals, it does not become me to
say much about them.  But I try to be honest and true; and,
therefore, I must speak plainly to you, and tell you that if I am
ever so bad, I do not believe that you can improve me by preaching
to me."</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 276 -->

<p>"I shall, ah, not preach to you," replied the professor, "for I
have not got, ah, my notes with me, ah, and I have not, ah, meditated
any subject for the occasion.  I never preach, ah, without
ah, preparing myself beforehand, and, ah, having my notes, ah,
with me."</p>

<p>"O, very well, I am glad to hear it," I replied; "and do,
professor, make your visit as brief as possible, for really, I do
not like you."</p>

<p>"I have generally, ah, been acceptable to the congregations I
have preached to, ah, and to my patients, ah," he replied.</p>

<p>"That may be," said I; "you will pardon my plainness of
speech, for I must tell the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, and so must I, ah, and I am going, ah, to do it before I
go," said the professor, without altering his voice or manifesting
any displeasure at my remarks.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, ah, you think because I am, ah, a preacher of the
gospel," whined the professor, "and am, ah, not so, ah, fashionably
dressed in my, ah, outward apparel, that I am ah, not so
well off in the world as, ah, some others.  But I, ah, have made a
sufficiency as a professor of, ah, dentistry and I own houses, ah,
in, ah, New York; and I, ah, am not, ah, dependent upon, ah,
anybody else for, ah, my bread."</p>

<p>"Then you are a happy man," I said.</p>

<p>"Well I, ah, have felt myself so, ah, ever since, ah, I made
my, ah, peace with, ah, my maker," said the professor.</p>

<p>This turn in the conversation was rather unlucky for me, as
it caused the professor to fall into what he called a praying frame
of mind, and falling on his knees, he clasped his hands together,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, ah, let us, ah, try to pray."</p>

<p>The professor did not seem to try very hard, for he prayed a
very long prayer, and in such set terms, and with such volubility,
that it seemed infinitely more natural and easy for him to
address the Throne of Grace than to address even so humble and
unworthy a person as myself.  In truth, so easily and fluently

<!-- Volume II, page 277 -->

did he pray, and so soothing was the flow of his devout supplications,
that I was directly lulled asleep, and was only awoke by
the sudden and startling manner in which he pronounced Amen.</p>

<p>"Brother," said the professor, as he again seated himself by
my bed side, "do you feel better?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," I replied.  "But I wish you would gratify
me by stating the object of your visit, and so relieve my mind
from the suspicion that I am to learn some bad news."</p>

<p>"I, ah, will not deny, ah, that something will, ah, be told to
you by and by, perhaps that, ah, may be unpleasant for you to
ah, hear.  But you know all the, ah, troubles of, ah, this world
are, ah, sent upon us for our good."</p>

<p>"I do not know, nor do I believe any such thing, professor,"
I replied.  "Such a belief would at once be destructive of all
happiness in the world, and instead of striving to avoid evils
and misfortunes, everybody would be running into danger.  It
was well enough in the old monkish times for men to believe
that their happiness hereafter would be in proportion to their unhappiness
here, and to glory in self-inflicted flagellations, starvations,
and all manner of asceticisms; but you, professor, who
have read the Bible, know very well that such a doctrine is contrary
to the whole philosophy and teaching of the holy book."</p>

<p>"You, ah, forget, my friend, ah, that Christ, ah, wore a crown
of thorns, ah, on his head, ah, and this his, ah, precious back
was <i>scourged</i> with thongs and whips."</p>

<p>"No, I do not," I replied; "but I remember what you forget,
that they were not self-inflicted.  He bore them patiently,
but he did not seek them."</p>

<p>"I, ah, am sorry to see, ah, my friend," said the professor,
"that you are still in the, ah, bonds of wickedness and ignorance.
It is, ah, not worth while to argue with you, ah, on
such matters.  I, ah, am regularly ordained as, ah, preacher of
the, ah, gospel.  I, ah, am willing to, ah, instruct you and, ah,
to comfort you, ah, spiritually, or in the line of my profession;
but I, ah, have not time to, ah, argue with you, because, ah,

<!-- Volume II, page 278 -->

you have not yet, ah, been regenerated, nor, ah, got a hope."</p>

<p>"My hopes, Professor, I must admit," said I, "are at a very
low ebb; and they have not much improved since you honored
me with this visit.  If you have any secrets to divulge to me, any
ill news to tell me, or any advice to give me, let me know the extent
of it at once, for I am harassed and wearied by what I see
and hear.  I am strong enough to bear up under any affliction, or at
least I shall never be better able than now; so let me know at
once what it is that you have visited me for, and why you pray
over and talk to me in the manner you have been doing.  I am no
longer a child, and I can bear my fate let it be what it may!"</p>

<p>"I have, ah, got nothing to tell you of myself," said the professor,
"but, ah, some of your friends, ah, have, and as your mind has
been, ah, very weak, and your body has, ah, been almost in the
grave, for you, ah, know your death was, ah, in the, ah, newspaper,
the doctor, ah, thought it was best to prepare you for the interview
which you are about to have with, ah, certain person, and the, ah,
intelligence which is, ah, to be conveyed to you be, ah, that individual."</p>

<p>"What individual?" said I.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I, ah, should apologize," said the professor, "for ah,
applying the term individual to him, for I know it is a coarse
word to use; and I, ah, generally, ah, avoid it in, ah, my pulpit discourses.
The term individual has, ah, often been applied to me
by other people, but,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The word is a good word, professor," I replied, interrupting
him.  "I have no objection to its being applied to me, or to anybody
else.  Let it be an individual, but only tell me who the individual
is, that I may individualize him and know for what purpose
he visits me."</p>

<p>"It is, ah, no business of mine," said the professor, "but the, ah,
doctor said it must be broke to you gradually, and ah, he sent for
me, ah, to prepare you, ah, for it.  I ah, have property in the neighborhood,
and I, ah, am, in fact, the owner of this house; but I
keep my, ah, office in New York, and I will, ah, give you my card.

<!-- Volume II, page 279 -->

I don't preach there statedly because my, ah, health will not permit
me to do it."</p>

<p>I was afraid to interrupt him lest I should say something to
turn his discourse in a new direction, so I patiently closed my
mouth while he went on in the soothing process, preparing my
mind for his final disclosure by telling me that his family lived
near by because it was cheaper than living in the city; that
he had a brother in the ministry; that his wife was poorly, and
that his patients in dentistry were chiefly pious people of his
own persuasion, whose teeth were generally out of order; and that
but for his regard for them he would abandon his profession
and devote himself wholly and exclusively to taking care of his
property and preaching the gospel.</p>

<p>"But, as I was, ah, saying," said the professor, reverting once
more to the motive of his visit, "I, ah, should not have called
that person, ah, individual if I had not a meditation on the subject
before, ah, speaking on it to you.  But, ah, he is, ah, now,
waiting to be, ah, introduced to you, and ah, I think his name
is, ah, Captain, ah,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain!" I exclaimed, as the truth now flashed upon me,
"Captain St. Hugh!  Is it he?"</p>

<p>"I believe, ah, that is what they, ah, call him," said the professor,
"and I heard the doctor say he, ah, thought you, ah,
were his son."</p>

<p>"I am his son," I said&mdash;"they know I am his son; and is
this what they call bad news.  If he is here, why do they not
let him come in?"</p>

<p>"They, ah, thought it necessary, ah, first to prepare you for
it," said the professor, "lest it should, ah, cause a relapse of
your disease, ah, I believe."</p>

<p>"Fools that they are!" I exclaimed, "to think it necessary to
prepare me for such an announcement as this.  And they
have deprived me of seeing him, lest my mind could not bear
anything so agreeable!"</p>

<p>"You had, ah, better not grow too excited," said the professor;

<!-- Volume II, page 280 -->

"it, ah, may go to your head.  The captain, I believe, is
very quiet about it, and will, ah, not like to see you, ah, too
much disturbed."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly calm and self possessed," I said.  "But I
shall not be if you remain here to distract me by your advice.
Be so good as to go out and assure my father, or Captain St.
Hugh, that I am perfectly quiet, and hope he will not delay any
longer to allow me the happiness of seeing him."</p>

<p>The professor then withdrew, and the intervening moments
between his exit and the entrance of Mrs. Swayne, accompanied
by the doctor and Captain St. Hugh, seemed to me almost
an endless period.</p>

<p>I hope my readers will be blessed with imaginative capacities
sufficiently powerful to enable them to form some idea of the
pleasing tumult caused in my feelings by the entrance of Captain
St. Hugh; for I shall not attempt to give any description of the
amazement and delight which I felt at the unlooked for apparition.
In truth, I had never dreamed of the possibility of my
father coming there to see me, and, in all my surmises and imaginings
as to the mysterious person who had been watching at
my bed, I did not once think of him.  I had made up my mind
that he had deserted me for good, that my conduct had so grieved
him he would never consent to see me again; and, being possessed
with such an idea, the thought of his following me about in
my wanderings, and watching over me in my sickness, when I
supposed that all the world, but the two faithful women who had
given me shelter, had abandoned me, had never occurred to me.</p>

<p>But I now saw him standing at my bed side, looking upon me
as kindly and affectionately as he had ever done in my younger
years, and the joy that I felt on beholding him again, exceeded
my power of speech.  But, if the power to express out sensations
in words is denied us, our countenances are denied the power to
hide our feelings, and my grateful looks must have told my father
what my tongue could not.</p>

<p>He attempted to speak, but could only ejaculate, "God bless

<!-- Volume II, page 281 -->

you, my boy! God bless you!" Then taking my hand, he sat
down, and laying his head upon my pillow, he wept aloud.  The
tender heart of Mrs. Swayne could not withstand such an exhibition
of feeling, so she commenced weeping, too, and made so
much noise, that the doctor thought it better that she should indulge
her sympathetic manifestations elsewhere; and he took her
by the arm and led her out of the room, and had the good sense
to remain out himself; so that my father and I were left alone
together.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before Captain St. Hugh had sufficient
command over his voice to speak, and, as he sat by my side
wiping his eyes, I thought I had never before seen him look so
well, nor felt such a strong affection for him.  He was but little
altered since I had seen him last: his head showed more white
hairs, and his whiskers were cut shorter, but he was not quite so
stout, and his face had lost somewhat of the flush which it used
to wear.  He had, in brief, become Americanized in appearance,
to a certain degree; although he was still an undeniable Englishman
in his looks, and had that peculiar frankness of manner, and
neatness of person, which distinguish a naval officer.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said he, trying to cough down his emotion,
"had you quite forgotten me?"</p>

<p>"Forgotten you!" I exclaimed; "had you forgotten me?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my lad, I did not mean to reproach you," he said;
"if you did forget me, you have not forgotten my advice."</p>

<p>"I have done nothing, I hope," I said, "to dishonor the name
of St. Hugh."</p>

<p>"No, my son, you have not; and I am grateful to you for it.
You are worthy to bear the name of St. Hugh, and henceforth
you shall," said he.  "But, my poor boy, you must suffer for
the sin of your father, and it is that which grieves me, and caused
me to weep when saw you.  But I must not disturb your mind
to-night.  You are too feeble yet to bear what I have to tell you.
The physician will not allow me to talk with you to-night, but
in the morning you will be refreshed, and then I shall tell you

<!-- Volume II, page 282 -->

more.  God only knows, my poor boy, what I have endured for
you, and how truly I have endeavored to serve you."</p>

<p>I begged him to remain with me as long as he could, and assured
him that I was much stronger than the doctor supposed.
But he said that it would be better that I should be refreshed by
sleep, after being so much excited, and insisted on leaving me.
I felt too happy to oppose him; and after bidding me an affectionate
good night, he withdrew, and soon after I fell into a
refreshing sleep from which I did not awake until the next morning's
sun was shining brightly in my face.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

</div>

<p>I FELT so strong and hearty, after eating my bowl of Indian
porridge, which was the unsavory diet prescribed for me by my
physician, that I was allowed to dress myself, and received my
father in the little parlor of Mrs. Swayne's cottage.</p>

<p>Captain St. Hugh looked brighter and more cheerful, as he
saluted me in the morning, than he had done the night before.
He complimented me upon my improved appearance  and, having
taken his seat by me, said:</p>

<p>"You have been subjected to a hard trial, my boy, but you
have come out of it bravely; and now I shall be proud to own
you as my son before the world.  But I had resolved never again
to hold any intercourse with you, if you had proved unworthy of
the name of your ancestors.  I have the honest pride of family,
my boy, which every honest man feels who has a family to be
proud of; and, as you had shown a disposition to tricks which
no St. Hugh had ever been guilty of, I determined to sacrifice
my own feelings, and never own you for my son, unless you
were worthy of the honor.</p>

<p>"But, I could not desert you, and leave you to the temptations
with which you were surrounded without supplying you with the
means necessary to maintain your respectability in life; therefore

<!-- Volume II, page 283 -->

I gave orders to your good friend, Mr. Bassett, to give you
all the money you might want, but to leave you wholly to yourself,
and allow your natural propensities to develop themselves.
I kept constant watch of your movements; I tracked you from
door to door; I knew all your secrets, and wherever you went
there I followed you."</p>

<p>"Then it was you whom I so often met, and imagined I had
seen your ghost?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was I, and many a time have I had to struggle with
my feelings which prompted me to stop and embrace you.  It was
my sole object in life to watch over you, and protect you;
my family in England knew nothing of your history, nor even
of your existence, and I was too proud, my boy, to introduce you
to them as my son, until I myself felt sure of your integrity of
character.  For, I knew that your conduct would be jealously
scrutinized; the unfortunate circumstances connected with your
birth would cause you to be slighted, and unless you could found
your claim to their respect on your own upright character, you
had better never be acknowledged as a member of the family of the
St. Hughs.  But I am happy to feel assured, that you have
conquered the propensity to prevaricate and deceive, which
caused me so much unhappiness when I first discovered it, and
that I may now confide in you, as a man of honor, and a gentleman."</p>

<p>I felt very much embarrassed to hear myself addressed in
this manner by Captain St. Hugh, but my heart swelled with delight
to know that my conduct had been approved by him.</p>

<p>"You know, my boy, he continued, whether you have ever
done aught that I could not approve, and I have confidence in
you to feel sure you will tell me if you have?"</p>

<p>I then assured him that I had never been guilty of a falsehood
since I had seen him last, and had resolved, even though it should
cost me my life, never to be guilty of a dishonorable action; and
that I was not conscious of ever having been guilty of anything,
in thought or deed, which I wished to keep secret from him.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 284 -->

<p>"And you have been in love?" said he.</p>

<p>I then related to him all that had passed in relation to Pauline,
to which he listened with great attention.</p>

<p>"And you still love her?" he said.</p>

<p>"I mean to marry her," I said; "for my word is passed, and
I cannot break it."</p>

<p>"What, my boy!" said he, "would you marry her if you did
not love her; for I fear that you do not; and entail upon yourself
a life of wretchedness, merely to redeem a pledge that was
exacted from you under false pretenses?"</p>

<p>"I must," said I, "for the fault was my own if I suffered myself
to be deceived.  I must bear up under the consequences of
my own folly; and, as soon as I am fully restored to health, I
shall keep my promise to Pauline."</p>

<p>"But that is carrying your principle too far," said he; "for
suppose that she should prove herself unworthy of you?"</p>

<p>"My promise to her was unconditional," I replied; "if I had
dreamed of her proving unworthy, I should never have bound
myself to her.  The change is not in her, but in me.  I have
discovered in another the charms and virtues which I imagined,
in my blindness, she possessed."</p>

<p>"O, ho!" said he; "and pray, who is this other divinity that
you have now fallen in love with?"</p>

<p>"I fear that you will not approve my choice," said I; "but if
you knew as much of Sylvia as I have learned, since I have been
lying here in her mother's house, you would love her as well as
I do, and be as grateful for her kindness."</p>

<p>"So, then," said he, "you are pledged to marry Pauline, but
have transferred your affections to Sylvia?  Faith, my boy, you
are in a very peculiar condition, so far as your matrimonial
prospects are concerned; and, as for the honor of the thing, I can't
see that there would be much to boast of, in vowing to love one
woman, as her husband, while you are really in love with another.
You have some of your father's weakness, my poor lad,
and I am afraid you will always be getting into difficulty, while

<!-- Volume II, page 285 -->

you are in danger of becoming acquainted with beautiful
women."</p>

<p>"Of course, said I, "I should not marry Pauline without
first telling her, that I had ceased to love her."</p>

<p>"Of course then" said he, "you will not marry her, for she
would not consent to take you on such conditions."</p>

<p>"I think she would," I replied.</p>

<p>"And you have resolved to try her, in spite of your love for
Sylvia?" said he.</p>

<p>"My determination has been taken," I said, "and I shall not
swerve from it."</p>

<p>"Poor lad! and you are very unhappy about it?" said he.</p>

<p>"I should be, if I were not convinced from what has already
befallen me, that the only way to be really happy is to be true
and honest.  It will all come right in the end, if I only act right
in the beginning, I am persuaded.  I could hardly have hoped to
meet you again, and to know that you approved my conduct, but
I tried my best to be honest and faithful, and now I have the happiness
to know you love me."</p>

<p>"Bravo, my boy! Bravo!" exclaimed my father, as he patted
my shoulder, "you are my son, and an honor to the St. Hughs.
And now, my lad, you have removed a great load from my heart
by your honest confession; for I knew that you had loved the
daughter of that old Wall-street usurer, but I did not know
the change your feelings had undergone towards her.  I had
something to tell you about her which I was afraid would upset
you again, and throw you upon your back.  Your death in the
newspaper had an effect upon her that you could not have anticipated."</p>

<p>"Surely," said I, "she is not dead?"</p>

<p>"O, no!" he said; "It did not quite kill her."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can anticipate what you were going to tell me," I
said, while a feeling of remorse touched my heart, and I half repented
of my want of loyalty to her; "she has gone crazy.
Poor Pauline!"</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 286 -->

<p>At this my father laughed loud and long.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! my poor credulous boy!" said he; "she has
not been put in a straight jacket, but in a wedding gown.  She
has been married!"</p>

<p>"Married!" I exclaimed, with a burning blush upon my
cheek; "Pauline married!  It cannot be!"</p>

<p>"It is true, my boy," replied my father coolly, as he took a
paper from his pocket; "and here is the report of it.  Yes, my
lad, she is married to a man older than I am.  But you must
give her credit for waiting until she saw your death in the paper.
Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>It was as my father stated.  On opening the paper I discovered
the marriage of Pauline with my old rival, Mr. Barton, and I
scarce knew whether to laugh or weep at the discovery.  It was
some consolation to my pride to know that she had waited until
she had reason to believe me dead, before bestowing her hand upon
a man, whom she knew I despised.  Poor Pauline!  She had not
half the heart I gave her credit for.  If I had entertained any revengeful
feelings towards her for her untruth, they would have
been amply gratified by knowing she had married Mr. Barton.
No doubt, they were heartily tired of each other already.</p>

<p>"Poor Pauline!" I ejaculated, as I thought of her.</p>

<p>"Then you had some remaining affection for her?" said my
father.</p>

<p>"She was very beautiful, and, I thought, very fond of me.  I
hope all women are not like her," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course they are not, my boy," said my father; "you
are happily rid of Pauline.  Think what your fate would have
been with such a woman for a wife!  Let her inconstancy teach
you caution for the future.  You have not yet declared yourself
to Sylvia, the young lady who has been so sisterly and kind to
you in your sickness?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then wait, my boy," he replied, "and be sure that you do
not mistake your gratitude to your nurse for the love which a

<!-- Volume II, page 287 -->

man should feel for his mistress.  I am afraid you are liable to
make such mistakes."</p>

<p>"But Sylvia is unlike other woman that I have seen," I replied.</p>

<p>"No doubt; but all women are alike, who are young and
pretty, to such young fellows as you," said he.</p>

<p>"You will object to Sylvia, perhaps," I said, "on
account of her father and mother."</p>

<p>"No, no, my boy.  You are unjust to me.  I would prefer
that you should marry a women in a different sphere of life; but
as the chief end of marriage is happiness, I would have you to
marry a woman you can love, and, in the end, it will matter little
who her connections are.  But, there will be time enough to discuss
this subject.  I have one more thing to tell you, which is
proper that you should know."</p>

<p>My father appeared somewhat embarrassed and at a loss how
to begin the revelation which he was going to make; but, after
hesitating a few minutes and taking two or three turns across the
little room, he sat down again, and very gravely said:</p>

<p>"I told you, my boy, that you must suffer for your father's
misconduct, and that it was the thought of it which had so painfully
grieved me on seeing you.</p>

<p>"I have told you, you doubtless remember, the circumstance
connected with your birth; how I met your poor mother,
how I imposed upon her innocence, and how keenly I had suffered
since in consequence, so that I need not distress you nor
myself, by again repeating the story."</p>

<p>Seeing that an allusion to the unhappy subject caused so much
distress to my father, I begged him not to repeat to me anything
which was not necessary, for I had a very lively recollection of
everything he had ever told me respecting my mother.</p>

<p>"It was one of my proudest thoughts, my boy, when I at first
found you, and saw, by the sparkle of your eye, the features of
your face, and the general carriage of your person, a reflection
of those personal qualities which have for ages distinguished my

<!-- Volume II, page 288 -->

family," said my father, as he warmly pressed my hand;
"that you would one day be the owner of Blackmere, and, as
the descendant of old Sir Eustace, do credit to the name of St.
Hugh.  I have dreamed that the wrong done to your innocent
mother, would be, in some degree atoned for, by placing her son
at the head of such a family as ours; but this must never be, my
boy.  No&mdash;my crime must be atoned for by you; and I must
die with the knowledge that my own child will be deprived of the
inheritance of his father.  Since we parted last, I have received
intelligence from my legal agent in London, who informs me that
the marriage with your mother cannot be legitimatized, and that,
consequently, you cannot inherit the estates and title which by
right belong to you; and they must, at my death, descend to a
remote relative whom I have never seen."</p>

<p>I cannot truly say that this piece of information did not unpleasantly
affect me, for I had indulged in many a dream of
Blackmere, and in my darkest days had been buoyed up with
the ambitious thought of one day being the master of that noble
estate; and I frankly told my father how I felt.  But, then, it
did not make me unhappy, to know that I should never realize
the proud dream in which I had so often indulged.  And, in truth,
I was too sincerely rejoiced at being restored to my father once
more, and to know that he still loved me, and that my conduct
was approved by him, to suffer the loss of Blackmere to depress
my spirits.  And so I assured him.</p>

<p>"You are a generous lad," said my father, "and I am grateful
for your forgiveness.  Perhaps, in after years, you may feel
less disposed to forgive me than you do now.  But, my son, I
have a fortune for you, saved from the income of my estate, and
every shilling of it shall be yours.  Here you may be rich, and
an honored citizen of a great nation.  You need not repine, my
son, at not being an Englishman, while you can boast that you
are an American with an English father.  I am proud of my own
country, God bless it! and you, my boy, have cause to be proud
of yours.  My affections are in England, but my home shall be

<!-- Volume II, page 289 -->

with you.  It is better that you should never see Blackmere.  It
would be humiliating to you to visit the home of your ancestors,
and feel yourself an alien in it."</p>

<p>I perfectly coincided in my father's opinions, and had no wish
to visit the old castle which would have been mine but for the
crooked laws and the bar sinister on my escutcheon.  I could
not feel very kindly the loss of honors which I had never enjoyed;
and the mention of the fortune, too, had a consoling effect
upon me.  I am afraid that the tender affection shown by my
father, and his humility in begging my forgiveness, that, owing
to his youthful indiscretion, I was deprived of the family honors to
which he seemed to consider me as naturally entitled, made me feel
a little vain, and less grateful than I should for his kindness. I
had never before felt myself of so much importance as I did then,
to hear this true hearted gentleman, who was the representative
of an old English family, the inheritor of a great estate, and who
had been honored for his public services, humbly implore my forgiveness
for a wrong which I had never felt, and beg me to accept
a fortune which would raise me from beggary to a splendid
independence.  If I did experience a momentary feeling of pride
and self-consequence, I must be just to myself, and say that it
soon passed off, and I again felt myself the grateful child of a
too generous and indulgent father.  I burst into tears as I thought
on the change of condition which I had undergone in a few hours,
and being still weak from the effects of my disease, probably expressed
more sensibility than I actually felt, for my father appeared
to be alarmed; and, mistaking the cause of my tears, he
attempted in the tenderest manner to soothe me.</p>

<p>"I should have waited, my boy, until you were heartier", he
said, "before I told you this unpleasant news.  But, now it is
out, we must make the best of it.  You will not lack for money,
my son; you have a good constitution, and, God willing, will
soon be up and hearty again; you are young; and know, by
actual contact with the world, exactly what it is made of; you
must have a clean conscience, and with all these, what is going

<!-- Volume II, page 290 -->

to prevent you being happy but your own perverseness.  Here
is life before you, my lad, now make the most of it, and be
happy.  Honors will come upon you thick enough, and time
enough, if you deserve them, and if you should get them without
deserving, you could not enjoy them."</p>

<p>With my heart overflowing with grateful feelings, I kissed
his hand, and thanked him for his care of me.  Just at that
moment Sylvia entered the room, thinking that I had called
her, from which circumstance it would seem probable that she
was near by, listening for a summons; but I must do her the
justice to say that she has often denied the fact, and I believe
her; although it is one of our little understood differences for
me to pretend to think otherwise.  She blushed as she entered
the chamber, and would have instantly retired on perceiving her
mistake, had not Captain St. Hugh detained her.  Never before
did she seem so lovely in my eyes; and her confusion, on
being requested to remain, by my father, gave her always charming
face so bewitchingly beautiful an expression, that I could
not help looking up to him with a feeling of triumph, in knowing
that I was loved by such an angelic creature.  The thought
occurred to me that, as he had advised me to make the most of
life, I could not make a better beginning than by securing such
a partner as Sylvia to assist me in my task; and, after she
withdrew, I told him that nothing would add so much to my
happiness, and enable me to carry out his advice, as an immediate
marriage with that excellent young woman.</p>

<p>"You are your father's own son, I see," he replied; "I
thought you might trump higher; but you can only love a woman,
even if she is a queen; and, as love is the one thing necessary
in marriage, you may be as happy with Sylvia as though
she were the daughter of an earl.  But, my boy, are you certain
she will have you?"</p>

<p>I told him that I felt quite convinced she would not refuse
me.</p>

<p>"Well then," said he, "you shall be married to-morrow."

<!-- Volume II, page 291 -->

And, jumping up, he ran out to inform Sylvia's mother, of the proposed
scheme for depriving her of her daughter.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;AND THE LAST.</p>

</div>

<p>WE were not married on the morrow, nor, in some months after;
for Sylvia, in the first place, did not yield to me proposal so readily
as I had, at first, vainly supposed she would.  And, at last,
when she did consent to have me, she would not yield to my
wish to be married until her father returned from sea, and gave
his consent. This act, more than her gentleness and her beauty,
endeared her to my father, and made him as solicitous for our
union, as he had at first been averse to it.</p>

<p>As an act of justice, and to place me right before the world
that I might begin life in my true character, and free from all
false assumptions or hurtful imputations, he resolved to honor our
nuptials by a public wedding, to which all those who had known
me should be invited, and, in their presence, he would acknowledge
me as his son, establish my right to the name of St. Hugh,
and silence the tongue of slander, by giving the true history of
my birth.  This scheme was fully carried out, and I had the gratification
of seeing at my wedding, nearly the whole of the worthy
group of personages whom I have introduced, but under fictitious
names, to my readers.  We were married in church to gratify my
father, and the wedding was celebrated in a fine large wooden
house, near the cottage of Sylvia's mother, which he had hired
and furnished for the happy occasion.  It was a bright day in October,
and nothing happened to mar the joyousness and harmony
of the proceedings, but a little disturbance caused by my old friend,
Ferocious, who was present among the rest, who fancied himself
insulted, because he found a newspaper about the premises which
had been taken out of a wine basket, that contained a not very
complimentary criticism upon one of his works.  He rose at the
table, and with his face on fire, denounced the whole wedding as

<!-- Volume II, page 292 -->

a plot got up for the express purpose of injuring his literary reputation;
and, after protesting against it, as an outrage upon his
feelings, called upon every friend of his present, to leave the
scene of festivities.  He stalked off as grandly as so small a person
could, but he was followed by nobody but Mr. Tibbitts, who
seemed loth to go, and yet afraid to stay.  I am happy to state that
these two gentlemen, finding that nobody went in pursuit,
both returned in about an hour afterwards, and appeared to enjoy
themselves exceedingly; and I had the satisfaction of being
assured by Mr. Tibbitts, who took advantage of the temporary
absence of Mr. Ferocious, that he had no ill feelings towards
me or my bride, and that he looked upon the wedding as quite a
novelty, and, upon the whole, a very pleasant little affair, "quite a
<i>fete champetre</i>, in the style of Watteau," as he expressed himself.</p>

<p>It was not among the least of my gratifications on that happy
day to meet, once more, Sophia Ruby, a woman of the finest nature
and the purest philanthropy, whose little vanities rather tended to
set off her excellent qualities, than to obscure their brightness.
She came attended by that excellent Quaker gentleman, Friend
Goodwill, his simple-hearted wife, his beautiful daughter, and his
roguish son; whose roguishness, let me add, was all owing to
the exuberance of his animal spirits.  Mrs. Ruby had not been
false to her aspirations for the beautiful, but had rouged her
cheeks as usual, and arrayed her person in as great a variety
of strong colors, as she well could.  She was not the less welcome
at my wedding for bringing with her my old acquaintance,
Mr. Ardent, the painter, with whom she was intimate.  Mr.
Pilfor and Mr. Riquets came together; and appeared greatly improved
in their manners.  I was happy to learn from them, that
they had started a new paper, called the Flageolet, of which they
were both editors and proprietors.  I requested them to consider
me as one of their yearly subscribers, but I afterwards learned
that the publication ceased after the first number; and I believe,
to this day those who paid their subscriptions in advance,
have not received back their money.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 293 -->

<p>My first and best friend, Mr. Bassett, with his wife, honored
my nuptials by coming, but did not remain to witness my father's
explanations; for Mrs. Bassett grew jealous at the attentions
which her husband paid to Sylvia, and compelled him to leave
before the festivities commenced.  Poor Mr. Bassett!  His wife
only died last year, and that estimable gentleman pays as much
respect to her memory as though she had been one of the best,
instead of the worst of wives.  None of the family of old Gil
came to the wedding, although they were all invited, even Mr.
and Mrs. Barton; but some of the literary gentlemen whom I
had seen at Lizzy's Soirees honored me with their presence,
and all put something in the paper about me afterwards.  Mr.
Wilton, and his quiet friend with the buff vest, came; neither
of them was much changed, but the quiet author had allowed
his moustaches to grow, which gave a whimsical expression of
mild ferocity to his subdued countenance.  That remarkable
genius, Professor Sprads, and his lady, were there, and played
incessantly upon the piano forte; they quarreled but twice during
the whole day; and, if the professor had not got little
excited by the wine he drank, they would have made a very
favorable impression on the company, and, as he subsequently
remarked to me, might have established some splendid connections
for himself.</p>

<p>It would hardly be proper for me to give a detailed account of
my own wedding, or to lavish any praises upon my beautiful
bride, who appeared, as everybody said, to better advantage
than ever before in her life; although this is not generally
the case with brides.  Her good mother and her rough,
but honest father, were quite bewildered, and were the only persons
present who appeared to regard themselves in the light of
intruders.  My mother-in-law was considerably alarmed and
mystified by a conversation which she was drawn into by Sophia
Ruby, on the subject of matrimony, Mrs. R. going into the very
depths of the matter and talking, as Mrs. Swayne thought, very
wildly about circles, and flowers, and spiritual unions.</p>

<!-- Volume II, page 294 -->

<p>My father was the most amused and gratified person of all, and
although he was not what is called a wag, he was delighted at
the oddities of some of my old friends, and took particular pleasure
in drawing out their peculiarities.  Professor Sprads and Mr.
Ferocious were objects of pleasantry to everybody, and the magnificent
airs of Mr. Pilfor, with his white cravat and moustaches,
inspired every one with awe.  The supper table was spread on the
piazza, which was festooned with the flags of England and America,
and brilliantly illuminated with colored lamps.  At the close
of the supper my father rose at the head of the table, and requesting
attention to a few remarks he had to make, related all the
particulars of my birth, my subsequent career, and closed by
stating the amount of money which he had invested for me in
good stocks.  The last announcement caused a spontaneous burst
of applause, and a regular hip, hip, hurrah, from all the gentlemen
present, who, being all more or less excited by wine, and
off their guard, unconsciously paid this tribute to gold, and showed
how they valued it beyond all other considerations.</p>

<p>The congratulations which followed the close of my father's
speech were quite overpowering; even friend Goodwill appeared
to entertain a better feeling towards me, when he found how independent
I was in my worldly circumstances.</p>

<p>After the supper, the speech, and the congratulations, Sylvia
and myself stole away from the company, and being very
weary, retired to rest, while they went out into the orchard to
see the fireworks which my father had prepared, under his own
supervision, as a wind-up to the day.  I did not see them, but
the glare of colored lights which shone into my bed-room windows,
and the cheers of the company, kept me awake until past
midnight.</p>

<p>A steamboat had been provided to convey the guests back to
the city, and as they embarked towards morning, they alarmed
the inhabitants of the quiet old town by their boisterous
cheers.</p>

<p>I have not alluded to the schoolmaster, as one of the wedding

<!-- Volume II, page 295 -->

guests; the truth is, that poor Mr. Gossitt suddenly disappeared
from the place as soon as he learned that I was to be married
to Sylvia, and we all thought that he had jumped into the river
and destroyed himself.  But, greatly to our delight, a few months
after the wedding, I received a package one day, and on opening
it, discovered it to be a presentation copy of his lectures on
Shakespeare, which had been published to satisfy a growing demand
for criticisms on the great poet.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have now arrived at the stopping place in the history of my
life, where I intended to halt when I commenced the narrative.
I do not feel now that my readers will be altogether satisfied with
the termination of my career; but it will be very unreasonable
in them not to be, for it is very satisfactory to myself.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon says, that the great advantage which romancers
have over historians, is, that they can shape wants to their own
liking, and make a story terminate according to the wishes of
the reader.  This is undoubtedly true, and if I had been writing
a romance instead of giving a true history of a part of my life, it
is likely that my story would have ended very differently.</p>

<p>It is due to myself, and to certain persons who, I have been
pained to learn, will persist in the belief that I have been drawing
portraits of them under fictitious names, to repeat that I have never
designed to do such a thing, and that no one can regret the
accidental resemblances, which, it is said, have been discovered
between certain personages in the course of my trippings.</p>

<p>Some of the people, whose friends have been so keen as to
trace out a likeness, I have never seen, and others are intimate
acquaintances and friends for whom I entertain too high
a personal regard, to dream of caricaturing their follies or peculiarities.
In reality, the only person who has been intentionally
introduced, and whose weakness and failings have been shown up
is the author himself, and no one else has any right to complain.
If any person has been amused by the rambling narrative, or had

<!-- Volume II, page 296 -->

his thoughts awakened to the importance of frank and truthful
dealing in his intercourse with his fellow men, the author's ambition
will be gratified, and, slight and imperfect as the work is,
he will not regret the snatches of time bestowed upon it, although
he is aware that they might have been employed to better advantage
on more serious matters.</p>
