<p>WRITERS of what have been called Utopian Romances
need not accuse their rivals of plagiary,
since they are all treading in the track of giants like
Aristophanes and Swift. But it may be well to state
that I had not read <i>The Coming Race</i> until these volumes
were passing through the press, and that I have never
seen <i>Erewhon</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of an experience of metempsychosis has
dwelt in my mind since, walking with one of England's
great poets on the terrace of Rydal Mount, in full-sight
of that "a&euml;rial rock" which he loved to greet at morn
and leave last at eventide, he answered an inquiry of
mine with the immortal words on my title-page.</p>

</div>

<p>MY father, Colonel Ellesmere, one of
the most brilliant cavalry officers of
his day, sold out after the Peace of Paris in
1763, and afterwards passed his time between
London and the family seat of his
uncle, Sir Ralph, near Rothwell, in Northamptonshire.
Sir Ralph, a bachelor, was

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

always fond of him, and made him his heir.
As I was not born till 1780&mdash;the memorable
year of Lord George Gordon's riots&mdash;I have
only traditions of my father's fame. He
had been a gallant leader in India and
Canada, and became quite a favourite with
the young King and the ladies of the
Court. The King knighted him; the ladies
coquetted with him; he was the most admired
dancer at Almacks', which famous
assembly was opened in the very year that
the King was first suspected of insanity, and
that our American colonies resisted the
Stamp Act. My father might have made
choice between many beauties (so I have
been told) in those days when his feats of
war were fresh; but he liked better his gay
life about town, which was then a brilliant
city of manageable size. He wore the finest
<i>Nivernois</i> hat in St. James's; there used

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

to be a picture of him in the gallery at
Ellesmere, <i>&aelig;tat</i>. 35, his long curls adorned
with this toy of the time, a large silver
<i>chou-fleur</i> set in front. A hideous affair,&mdash;but
a man of his build could wear it without
being very ridiculous.</p>

<p>My father, in the course of a few years,
came to live much at Ellesmere, for Sir
Ralph's health began to fail, and he wanted
the company of his favourite nephew. Sir
Arthur came to live permanently in Northamptonshire,
the year the great Lord Chatham
died; after that time he settled down
into a country gentleman, taking (by Sir
Ralph's desire) the management of the estate,
and setting up a pack of foxhounds.</p>

<p>"When wilt thou marry, Arthur?" Sir
Ralph used to say.</p>

<p>I have often heard my father tell the
story.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

<p>"I can't die happy till I see you with a
boy to take the estate."</p>

<p>"I'm an old fogy, sir," my father would
say. "I'm forty-five. Where's the lady
who will take an old soldier like me, when
there are so many gay gallants of the town
to be had?"</p>

<p>"Not many like thee!" said the old man.
"Why, I'm twice thy age, and could find it
in my heart to marry to spite thee."</p>

<p>This friendly after-dinner quarrel between
uncle and nephew went on day after day;
but nothing came of it till one afternoon, as
Sir Arthur was riding home alone from the
hunting-field, he met with an adventure.
He saw a coach overturned in the miriest
lane of the neighbourhood. Those Northamptonshire
lanes are knee-deep in slushy
mud to this day; what they were in 1778
passes the imagination of man. I don't

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

think the Mount Sorel quarries had been
opened; at any rate, their hard stone has
not reached the Rothwell vicinage to this
day.</p>

<p>My father (how often he told me the
story, while my mother's blue eyes filled
with tears, though she laughed all the
while!) rode up to the overturned travelling
chariot, which had four horses, and
helped the frightened postilions to extricate
the travellers. They were two: a lady not
more than sixteen or seventeen, evidently
of perfect blood, as indeed of perfect beauty,
but with a sad perplexed terrified expression
in her eyes; a gentleman, over six feet
high, with black hair and eyes, and a coffee-brown
complexion, his brow cut by a sabre-slash
diagonally. My father recognised
him at once as a notorious bully and blackleg
of London; Captain Mayo he called

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

himself, but was better known as Bully
Mayo. He evidently did not recognise my
father.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he said, when my father
had got him out&mdash;for the fall had regularly
doubled him up. "We have had an accident,
you see, and I am afraid it will take
us some time to get things in order again.
I am anxious to make&mdash;this lady comfortable."</p>

<p>"There isn't a house of entertainment
near," said my father, who saw at once there
was something wrong; "but if you like to
come on to my house, or rather my uncle's,
we can make you pretty comfortable."</p>

<p>"Oh, let us go! Is it far?" said the
young lady. "I am so tired! Oh! my
dear sir, I shall be so thankful for a little
rest."</p>

<p>"Can't we get on, postilions?" cried

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

Bully Mayo, in a surly, vexed voice.</p>

<p>"There's a wheel right off, and a shaft
broke, your honour," said one of the men.
"I wonder whether there's a blacksmith or
a carpenter near."</p>

<p>"Just a mile on, my man, at Rowell,"
said my father.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we must accept your kind
offer of hospitality, sir," said Bully Mayo,
with grim reluctance. "To whom am I indebted?"</p>

<p>"I am Sir Arthur Ellesmere," said my
father, who all this while was not wasting
time, but had seated the lady on his hunter,
and prepared to lead her homewards. "We
shall be at the gates in five minutes," he
continued, "and then," with a gay smile to
this distressed damsel, "you will be comfortable."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph, who so loved his nephew that

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

he was wont to watch for him on hunting
afternoons from the library window that
looked down the long oak avenue, was
rather surprised to see the approaching
cavalcade&mdash;my father leading his hunter
with a lady seated on its splendid loin, and
a tall black man stalking stolidly along on
the other side. When this procession reached
the great hall door, it was at once
thrown open, and servants were ready. My
father lifted the lady from her horse, and
almost carried her up the steps. He declared
that he lifted her over the threshold,
that being the way to bring luck to a house
the first time any lady enters it. The old
housekeeper, Mrs. Scott, was in the hall&mdash;an
ancient personage, whom I used to revere
intensely. She had been Sir Ralph's confidential
servant for half a century. To her
care my father consigned the young lady;

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

and then showed Bully Mayo into the
library, where Sir Ralph was sitting. They
were most courteous to each other all this
time, but Mayo was evidently puzzled.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph received him with the same
courtesy. My father explained in few
words what had occurred.</p>

<p>"These are very bad roads," said my
great-uncle. "We ought to mend our ways.
The least we can do, after leaving our roads
in such a state as to upset your equipage, is
to offer hospitality until you can proceed."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, I'm sure," said Mayo.
"We wanted to get forward on important
business."</p>

<p>"Not to get married, I hope," said Sir
Ralph, jestingly.</p>

<p>"Not a <i>second</i> time," said Mayo, thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>While this brief conversation took place,

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

my father slipped out of the library, caused
ample refreshment to be sent in to Mayo, and
went in search of Mrs. Scott. The upper
staircase was full of excited servant-maids.
The first he met told him that the young
lady had been ill-used. When he reached
the apartment Mrs. Scott had provided for
her, he encountered the old housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Sir Arthur," she said, excited
beyond what you would imagine possible of
an old lady near seventy, "this poor young
creature is in such trouble. This wretched
man, she never met but once before, has
decoyed her away from her aunt's house by
Market Harborough, with a letter saying
that her father was over at the Duke's, dying,
and must see her directly; but she says he
has been talking to her in such a dreadful
way that she is sure something is wrong, and
she was so glad when the coach upset and

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

you came by. She wants to know what she
ought to do."</p>

<p>"Who is she, Scott?"</p>

<p>"She's the Lady Amoret Lyle, sir, daughter
of Lord Lyle, that used to come to see
Sir Ralph years ago."</p>

<p>"We'll take care of her, Scott. She's a
pretty little thing. I'll send a man to
Boughton, to know if Lord Lyle is there.
Cheer her up."</p>

<p>My father had come to a prompt conclusion.
He knew Bully Mayo well by repute,
and had seen him once or twice. When he
descended to the library he found him alone,
Sir Ralph having retired. Mayo, happily
engaged with a decanter of port wine, looked
at him with a glazed eye, regarding the
event with inapprehensive brain.</p>

<p>"You did not offer me your name," said
my father; "but are you not Captain Mayo,
of the Guards?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

<p>"I am," he said, beginning to see that he
must try to be equal to the situation.</p>

<p>"And the lady with you; may I ask who
she is?"</p>

<p>"You may <i>ask</i>," he said. "She is a lady,
that's all."</p>

<p>Mayo stood up, rather unsteadily.</p>

<p>"You were going to Boughton, were you
not?"</p>

<p>"Damn it, sir," said Mayo wrathfully,
with hand on sword, "how dare you question
me? Do you call this hospitality? I
was thankful for your entertainment&mdash;but
now you are troublesome. Lend us a carriage
for a mile or two, and we'll get away
to-night."</p>

<p>"Lady Amoret Lyle is far too ill to leave
to-night, Captain Mayo, and will not leave
in <i>your</i> company at any time."</p>

<p>When Bully Mayo saw that the lady's

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

name was known he grew desperate and
drew his sword.</p>

<p>"O, is that your game?" said my father,
one of the finest masters of the rapier in
Europe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and disarmed him in an instant.
Then he touched a bell, and two or
three stalwart servant-men came in.</p>

<p>"Take that man," he said, "and duck him
in the horsepond. Then turn him outside
the gates."</p>

<p>The order was carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>Next morning my father saw Lady Amoret
Lyle, and thought her the most perfect
creature in the world. She received him
in an undress of cashmere and tears. She
looked provokingly pretty. Her almost
baby face, her blue eyes, her pouting petulant
lips, her hair that was neither fair nor
dark, her girlish bust and shapely arms,
have been well depicted on ivory by a

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

master of miniature. My father fell in love
at once. He could not wait to hear anything
she had to say. He strode across the
room to the beautiful child, took her in his
arms, and kissed her, with old Mrs. Scott
looking gravely on.</p>

<p>He had not the remotest idea that she
was the first heiress in England&mdash;in pre-millionary
days.</p>

<p>When she came to herself after this
sudden embrace, she looked up merrily,
and said,</p>

<p>"What will papa say?"</p>

<p>She was at once joyous, having been
relieved from a scoundrel who wanted to
get her fortune, and finding a chivalrous
gentleman who loved her at first sight. For
she knew it was love at first sight, both for
him and for her. She has told me so many
a time. Indeed, the story of this adventure,

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

the only fragment of hearsay in my narrative,
was usually told me with one of my
parents as narrator, and the other as corrector.
It used to be great fun at Ellesmere
of a Winter evening in the library
after dinner. Being an only child, I had
fortunate privileges.</p>

<p>What became of Bully Mayo nobody ever
heard, nor indeed did anyone ever care to
know. After that horsepond, he may possibly
have repented. He kept well out of
the way both of Lord Lyle and of my
father.</p>

<p>At the time of this event Lord Lyle was
in London. My father sent a courier to
him, and he came down. He was something
at Court&mdash;Lord Chamberlain, I think.
I have seen his portrait&mdash;tall, stately, silver-haired.
When he came, he seemed at once
to have given consent to my father's marriage;

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

so here I am, the son of Sir Arthur
Ellesmere and Lady Amoret Lyle.</p>

<p>Events move in continuous cycles. How
often the same thing recurs it would be
impossible to say. What always struck me,
as soon as I began to think, was the absurdity
of age. I never could treat my mother
with proper veneration&mdash;I always regarded
her as the girl of sixteen who was the
heroine of my father's favourite after-dinner
story. And, in my judgment, she never
grew older. She was a precociously wise
little woman in her own opinion; but, oh!
how she liked to throw off the trammels of
custom, and have a bit of real fun! My
father and mother were a perfect couple,
though between them there were nearer
thirty years than twenty. He had a pleasant
paternal way of treating her, which she
liked very much. Besides, he was a young

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

man for his age. When I was a boy, he
always seemed young to me&mdash;he was full
of energy, riding, walking, driving. He
looked after all the affairs of the estate.
He was restless, indefatigable. So he never
seemed old to me in my youth, though
there was nearly half a century between
us.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph died just before my birth.
They called me Edward: I don't know why,
having no reason to believe it a family name.
However, Edward Ellesmere I am&mdash;or was&mdash;and
one name or label is pretty much
as good as another. My earlier years
are to me a perfect chaos of delight in the
memory. I could give no account of them.
I remember cantering with my father over
the grassland on an Exmoor pony; I remember
listening to my mother as she
played sweet music on the organ in the

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

great Hall. Thousands of days are deliciously
blended, all alike, all unlike, in my
frail memory, the central figures in every
scene being my stately father and my graceful
happy mother. Those two were all the
world to me; those two, and the old house,
which seemed as if it were made for them.
It was Eden!&mdash;it was Elysium! Pity such
pleasures cannot last&mdash;that boys must become
men and girls women!</p>

<p>As for me, poor devil, I was booked, in
time, for Eton!</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">ETON.</p>

<p class="small">"I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence."</p>

</div>

<p>"POOR devil!" That really was what I
thought when I started drearily from
Northamptonshire in the family travelling-carriage,
my father accompanying me a stage
or two, just to keep up my spirits. And my
heart sank when he left me, and the old
coach floundered southward. And it was
with a decided sinking of heart that I entered
the tutor's house at which I was to live.</p>

<p>But that was soon over. In a few days I

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

was a happy atom of that marvellous microcosm,
a great public school. I was just
the fellow for the situation. My father
had taught me self-reliance, my mother (how
often I thought of her and her last tears!)
had taught me courtesy, and I was born
with a tendency to enjoy the study of character.
Unluckily I was not always accurate
in my estimate of character; and a school-fellow
of mine at Eton was the cause of
nearly all my subsequent ill-fortune.</p>

<p>His name was Algernon Norton. He
had curly red hair, and greenish eyes, and
knees that were always making too close an
acquaintance with each other, and a most
plausible persuasive style of flattery. I fancy
his father was Norton &amp; Co. Plenty of
money he always had, and I suspect was in
the habit of lending it to his extravagant
school-fellows, at an exorbitant interest. If

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

Dr. Keate had found him out he would
have received the soundest flogging in the
annals of Eton.</p>

<p>This fellow became my favourite from my
first arrival at the school; he was in the
same house, and had ample opportunities.
He flattered me, mind and body; and boys
are quite as fond of flattery as girls. I
wrote his Latin verses for him&mdash;he did any
menial service I chose. He was my <i>umbra</i>.
I can only understand his conduct on the
supposition that he was the descendant
of a long line of knaves, and that his hereditary
instinct made him attach himself to
the heir to a baronetcy and two fine fortunes.
Two or three of my independent
friends warned me against him, but I argued
that he was a harmless useful fellow, though
confoundedly ugly.</p>

<p>"He'll serve you some rascally trick, by

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

Jove!" said Harry Vane, one day. "He's
just my ideal of Judas Iscariot or Oliver
Cromwell. I detest the fellow! Cut him,
Ned."</p>

<p>I wish I had taken Harry's advice; but I
indolently allowed Norton to maintain his
parasitical relation to me, finding that he
was useful in one way or another.</p>

<p>One of my pleasantest recollections of
Eton is the kind interest King George took
in the boys. There were few fine days
when he was at Windsor that he did not
stroll down to the playing-fields. When
he first saw me, and found out who I was,
he said,</p>

<p>"What, what, what!&mdash;Ellesmere's boy?
'Gad, he shall have a commission."</p>

<p>Wherewith he put his royal hand on
my long light curly hair, and went
on&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

<p>"Wilt fight, my boy, fight for your
King?&mdash;eh, eh, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Not your father's son if you didn't. Tell
him you're a cornet in the Guards."</p>

<p>"You're in luck, Ned," said Harry Vane,
when the King had left the field. "You'll
get your commission."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"You will, though, and full pay. There
are a lot of fellows with commissions. One's
a Major already, bless you!&mdash;Charlie
Nevile. He's eighteen, and he got his commission
at eighteen months. When Keate
flogs him, he always says&mdash;'<i>Now, Major
Nevile</i>'."</p>

<p>It turned out true. I was gazetted Lieutenant
and Cornet of the first Life Guards,
about the year 1796. I think it was the
same or the following year that I made the

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

largest score in the famous cricket-match
against the Oldfield Club; the next being
made by Sumner, who was afterwards an
Archbishop. Sumner was a very fast bowler.
We went in for fast bowling in those
days (before the "round hand" had been
invented), and I very seldom took a wicket
without breaking it. Greaves were unknown;
but the Etonian skin is marvellously
strong. Still, "leg before wicket" was a
rare offence.</p>

<p>Now I must relate one of the first messes
into which that villain Norton got me&mdash;I
cannot conceive why. One day he came to
me mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Ellesmere," he said, "can you keep a
secret?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather not&mdash;I've a bad
memory. I might forget it <i>was</i> a secret,
and tell somebody."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

<p>"Come, be serious, old fellow. What
should you say if a girl was in love with
you?"</p>

<p>"Why, that she had better give it up,
and try somebody else. Get out, or I'll
throw an inkstand at you! I'm turning
Romeo and Juliet into iambics."</p>

<p>"Better turn your iambics into Romeo,"
he retorted. "Do you remember that
little girl in pink we saw the other day in
Datchet Lane?&mdash;pretty little plump thing?"</p>

<p>"Well, what about her?"</p>

<p>"She's awfully in love with you. Her
father's a chemist in Peascod Street. She
wants to meet you."</p>

<p>"She must be a remarkably nice young
woman," I said, "Get out of this, Norton, or
I'll kick you out! Be off!"</p>

<p>He saw I was in earnest, and went; but he
returned to the charge. He was so persistent

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

that at last I half believed him; and we
one Summer afternoon met the girl, whose
name was Emily Watts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quite accidentally,
of course. Young, and devoid of experience
as I was, at once I saw that it was
what in these days is called a "plant;" there
was something in the look of the girl which
showed me that she was of a bad type.
When Norton had got us into conversation
he disappeared.</p>

<p>I spoke civilly to the young woman, who
was evidently disappointed by my slowness,
and thought me a fool. To say truth, my
great desire was to get away from her as
quickly and courteously as possible. I had
just succeeded in doing this, to my companion's
obvious disgust, when I noticed one of
the assistant-masters passing on the opposite
side of the road. His keen eye gave me a
recognizing glance. I walked homeward,

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

very much ashamed of myself, and frightfully
angry with Norton.</p>

<p>I lounged down to the margin of the
Thames and watched the boats. It was a
delicious Summer afternoon; the sky was
cloudless; the larks were Midsummer-mad;
a thrush on a great willow across the river
sang "Do it again! Do it again! Do it
again!" I remember it all, though I could
not enjoy it&mdash;for I was angry with myself,
with Norton, with the girl, with that keen-eyed
master. There was no great reason
for being angry with myself, seeing that I
had avoided temptation. Still I was.</p>

<p>Presently Norton came up, and touched
me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"What luck?" he said.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet. He was in his shirt-sleeves,
having been at cricket. I threw off
my jacket.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

<p>"Now, my good fellow," I say, "stand
your ground. I am going to thrash you."</p>

<p>He was two years older than I, and at
least a stone heavier; but before a ring could
be formed I had knocked him out of time.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Ned!" said Harry Vane. "With
a little practice you'll hit beautifully straight
from the shoulder. You shall come to my
room and put on the gloves with me now and
then."</p>

<p>We walked away together. Norton was
lying incapable upon the turf. I did not
speak to him again that term.</p>

<p>Of course I was not surprised at being
"sent for."</p>

<p>"You young officers of His Majesty's
Guards," said Doctor Keate, with bland
irony, "must not suppose that you are to
make love to all the girls of Windsor.
Colleger, bring me a birch-rod that is suitable

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

to the dignity of a cornet of horse."</p>

<p>Such an easy indolent tolerant fool am I,
that during the course of the next term I
allowed Norton again to become familiar
with me. Harry Vane was left, else I think
it could not have happened.</p>

<p>Norton was the most penitent of crocodiles.
He made himself useful at every
point; and I began to discover that it was
impossible to do without him.</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 1797, I was summoned
suddenly from Eton. My father was on his
death-bed. His horse had made a mistake
at a sunk fence, and my poor father was
brought home on a litter, with his spine
severed beyond the power of surgeons to
patch it up. I was so fortunate as to be
with him half an hour before he expired.
My dear mother was kneeling by his bedside,
holding one of his hands in both her

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

own. He languidly stretched to me the
other hand.</p>

<p>"Ned," he said, "thou art a true gentleman,
I believe. Love thy mother, and
trust in God. I am going to meet Him in
a few minutes. I am not afraid. I fought
for my King."</p>

<p>How quietly he passed! Something&mdash;a
sob or a sigh&mdash;seemed to shake that grand
frame, and then all was over. My dear
mother fainted; the women came and took
her to her room. It was long before I could
tear myself away from my father's body;
there came upon the dead face a calm still
satisfied expression, which seemed to me a
revelation. The soul is happy elsewhere (I
thought), or the body could not look so
happy here.</p>

<p>I pass by all the funereal celebration.
My mother was ill for weeks; when she

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

recovered, she implored me not to return to
Eton, but to remain at Ellesmere, to take
care of her. My mother had always been
very like an elder sister to me, and I felt
toward her in her present state a tender
pity, born of a love that was almost as
much fraternal as filial. She was so young,
I thought, for this terrible blow to fall upon
her&mdash;to lose the love and strength of a
man like my father&mdash;a man whom you
could not look upon without thinking that
he belonged to the noblest class of men&mdash;a
man to whom fear and dishonour were
words without meaning. I knew full well
that my darling mother would not long
survive this terrible loss. She did not.
Within six months she also lay in the family
vault in Rothwell churchyard.</p>

<p><i>I was alone!</i> Yes, in one sense; but in
another sense I had too much company.

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

My father's will was vague; the Court of
Chancery kindly appointed two trustees to
look after my affairs till I came of age.
How they came to be chosen, I cannot
imagine. One was Ezra Sykes, a retired
lawyer, who had at some time been employed
by my father; the other was General
Lord Clanfurly, G.C.B., the youngest General
in His Majesty's Army, and an old crony
of my father's. Sad as I was, I could not
help being amused when my two guardians,
or trustees, or whatever they were, met for
the first time at Ellesmere. Clanfurly rode
over in uniform, with his staff attending
him, and a troop of horse; for he was Commandant
of the district, and those were
days when we dreamt of French invasion.
It was quite cheery to hear the bugler's
call as the red coats came rattling into
Ellesmere courtyard. Mr. Ezra Sykes had

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

come in a carrier's cart from the nearest
point at which a stage-coach stopped; so,
when shown into the library to meet Lord
Clanfurly, his dingy yet glossy black habiliments
were covered with scraps of straw.</p>

<p>There had been some conversation about
me between my two ill-assorted guardians
before I was summoned to their presence.
When that summons arrived, I could not
help laughing at the <i>coup-d'&oelig;il</i>. I have an
intuitive sense of humour, and cannot avoid
laughter under the gravest situation, if anything
tickles my fancy. On the present occasion,
what did I see? There was an aide
of the general's sitting at a table, pen in
hand, suppressing his amusement as well as
he could. There was the legal and pious
Ezra Sykes, in greasy black broadcloth
much obscured by straws, standing on one
side of the fireplace&mdash;a blear-eyed round-shouldered

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

knock-kneed splay-footed animal.
On the other side stood Lord Clanfurly,
tall, shapely, and vigorous, one hand
by habit on his sword-hilt, his steel-blue eyes
looking right into the middle of his next
battle.</p>

<p>"Sir Edward Ellesmere," he said, when
I was called into the room, "Mr. Ezra
Sykes and I have been appointed by the
Lord High Chancellor your guardians. We
cannot quite agree as to what it is best for
you to do. I think you should go back to
Eton and finish your studies, Mr. Sykes
seems to object to this."</p>

<p>"I object to Eton," said the lanky Sykes,
with a mighty sigh, "because time is wasted
upon heathen studies, such as Latin and
Greek, which would be more properly expended
on Hebrew and commercial arithmetic.
The dullness of modern young

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

gentlemen is dreadful. Few of them know
that there are three six-and-eightpences in a
pound."</p>

<p>"Important knowledge," said the general
laughing, while the <i>aide</i> at the table gave
me an encouraging wink. "Come, young
gentleman, as your guardians differ, what
do you say? Will you go back to Eton?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord," I said.</p>

<p>"Then will you follow my advice?" said
Ezra Sykes, becoming eloquent. "Will
you let me be your guide, philosopher, and
friend."</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned first!" I said, indignantly.
"My lord," I went on, addressing
myself to the General, "I am a Captain in
His Majesty's Life Guards. My first duty
is to the King. I intend to join my regiment."</p>

<p>Sykes's horror would have made a picture.

<!-- vol 1 page 36 -->

Clanfurly put his hand in fatherly fashion
on my young shoulder and said,</p>

<p>"All right, my boy."</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">LIFE IN LONDON.</p>

<p class="small">"White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee!"</p>

</div>

<p>YES, while I had been fagging away at
my Homer and Horace, my cricket
and boating, promotion had reached me, and
I was now, at eighteen, a captain in the
Guards. The Earl of Clanfurly encouraged
me in my military ambitions, and I went to
London in the gayest spirit, with a fine allowance
and a splendid outfit. Ezra Sykes had
to give way to my resolute will, backed as
I was by the Earl, and he uttered a snuffled

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

protest through his nose. But Ezra had
his revenge; the management of my estate
was left in his hands: a pretty picking
the scoundrel made of it!</p>

<p>Before joining my regiment, I spent a
couple of weeks with Lord Clanfurly, at a
pleasant house he had near Totteridge, with
plenty of park-land. He was a widower,
with one daughter, married, and the mother
of many children; and his house was kept
for him by an elegant and demure person of
about thirty, who treated him with great
deference, but evidently had her own way
in everything. To me she was remarkably
courteous, and made me as comfortable as I
could desire. I spent a very pleasant fortnight
there; and the General gave me a
series of worldly lectures after dinner each
day, that were worth their weight in gold.
He inculcated a philosophy of refined and

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

elegant selfishness. I was by nature selfish
enough .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lover of luxury and laziness,
and a spoilt child to boot; Lord Clanfurly's
lectures confirmed me in my tendency to
become "Epicuri de grege porcus."</p>

<p>When I joined my regiment, I took rooms
in Pall Mall, over a saddler's .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. capitally
furnished and arranged, with a pleasant
view of the trees and lawns of Carlton Gardens.
When first I got into my uniform
and mounted my charger, what a splendid
fellow I thought myself! Everybody in the
regiment received me with a hearty welcome.
The son of a distinguished soldier,
with youth, good looks, and plenty of
money, it was not likely that I should be
unpopular. This was a time of delirious
delight. We were never weary of enjoyment.
Our life passed between London
and Windsor. We glittered through the

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

western streets, a splendid pageant. We
passed our nights sometimes in good society,
and sometimes in bad, but always where
life moved fast. We betted high, drank
deeply, threw money away on diamonds
and other luxuries for our frail friends.
We crushed ten years of life into one&mdash;with
the customary result. If I exceeded my
allowance, old Ezra Sykes showed a courtesy
you would not have guessed from his
grim appearance, and sent me as much as I
wanted. Of course he was quite right.
Why should the income of an estate be accumulating
at compound interest, when its
owner wants the money?</p>

<p>The history of my life at this time cannot
well be written. It was the mere foam and
froth of existence. I was popular everywhere,
from the Court downwards. I spent
money as if I had the purse of Fortunatus.

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

I rode the best horses, and drove the finest
equipages, and gave the costliest dinners in
London. I had in the highest degree the
passionate generosity of an intense selfishness.
My boyish career was the wildest of
that wild time when there was always
lightning in the air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the terrible time
of Napoleon. Anyone who cannot remember
that period cannot realize what men
felt then, or how fast we youngsters lived.
The great name of Napoleon hung in the
political atmosphere like some mighty comet
that comes close to earth, burning so fiercely
that moon and stars flicker and grow pale.
And because this great thought haunted us,
we lived in a defiant gaiety, sure that when
the supreme hour should arrive victory
would be with England. The temper of
the time is well indicated by Gillray's caricature
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. King George in colossal size,

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

curiously examining a Lilliputian Bonaparte,
who struts <i>en petit caporal</i> on the
palm of his hand.</p>

<p>My chief friend in those days was Captain
Lovelace, of my own regiment, about two
years older than myself. He differed from
me widely, being quiet and unostentatious,
though he spent money freely enough, and
thoroughly enjoyed any reasonable pleasure.
He used to give me excellent advice, and,
when I laughed at it, he would suggest
some brilliant dissipation. His motto was
that of Ovid, which Thackeray loved so
well:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. video meliora proboque,<br/>
Deteriora sequor."</p>

</div>

<p>The truth about Charles Lovelace was
that he ought to have been on active service&mdash;his
fine brain wanted work; at the
head of an army he would have been a

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

match for any marshal of Napoleon's&mdash;perhaps
for Napoleon himself. He did not
enjoy the lazy luxury of life as I did; he
pined for occupation, and took severe dissipation
as the only alternative. I saw through
the dear boy at the first, and the fact that I
appreciated his character made us close
friends.</p>

<p>He never talked of his family&mdash;indeed,
he was a man of singular reticence. I remember
it was in the Summer of 1804 (I
was a Major by that time, and expecting
soon to be Lieutenant-colonel) that he came
to my rooms one morning, and said,</p>

<p>"Ned, have you time for a ride this
morning, after parade?"</p>

<p>I was at breakfast, drinking claret, which
had become the fashion with us instead of
chocolate. This was wine for which I had
given a guinea a bottle. I confess I have

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

since tasted as good at a shilling. I was
turning over a heap of unopened notes
which my villain of a valet had just brought
in upon a gold salver&mdash;some were in pink
paper, and some in blue, but there was not
one worth the trouble of opening. I neither
wanted to know the amount of my tailor's
bill, nor what Aphrodite Severn had to say
to me. It was abominably hot&mdash;the trees
in Carlton Gardens opposite could not catch
a breath of air; I had already forgotten my
cold bath, and began to want another.</p>

<p>"I am at your service, Charlie," I said,
languidly. "Where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>There was a kind of sly hesitation about
him that puzzled me. He replied,</p>

<p>"Twickenham. The Thames breezes will
cool you."</p>

<p>"Charming idea!" I said. "But have
you any special reason for going to Twickenham?

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

And have you breakfasted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to the first question; no, to the
second. I shall attack that lobster. Have
you any champagne? I've been up all
night, and want a reviver."</p>

<p>The Villain (he was known as such among
my friends, and I have clean forgot his
name) brought some champagne. Lovelace
ate and drank with that fine ferocity noticeable
in a man who has been up all night.
I looked on languidly, dipping dry toast in
claret, and trying very hard to finish a
<i>rognon aux fines herbes</i>.</p>

<p>"My mother," said Lovelace, presently,
"has lately come up from the country, and
taken a house at Twickenham. I want you
to know her. I think she would do you
good, old fellow. So I arranged to bring
you down to luncheon, if you could manage
to come to-day. You will meet nobody else

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

except my sister Lucy, who is a mere girl.
She is several years younger than you and
I. So many of my family died young."</p>

<p>When a brother talks disparagingly of
his sister as a <i>mere girl</i>, don't you always
believe him. A stolid young gentleman
will often look contemptuously on a sister
who is made of much finer clay than himself.
Charlie was not stolid, but he did not understand
his sister Lucy.</p>

<p>That I accepted <i>va sans dire</i>. We had a
lovely ride that Summer afternoon. We
had a charming <i>al fresco</i> luncheon on the
lawn of Mrs. Lovelace's pretty cottage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
a lawn that sloped to the Thames, and was
dotted with beautiful trees. Mrs. Lovelace
herself was quite worthy of being Charlie's
mother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a kind stately old lady, who
had evidently borne a prominent part in
society of the highest class.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

<p>But Lucy? She had the tremulous movement
of the sensitive plant&mdash;the fragrant
life of the tall white lily. Her hair was a
rich brown, with specks of gold in it. Her
eyes were like the dog-violet. She was tall;
her hand was long and flexible, tipped with
narrow rosy nails. What struck you about
Lucy was that her soul seemed to burn
through its tenement; her flesh was translucent;
if she held her hand against a candle
the light shone through. Lucy answered
Milton's definition of poetry, being "simple,
sensuous, passionate." Her electric spirit
was stirred by even the unexpressed thoughts
of those who were with her, and her own
thoughts made themselves known, without
aid of speech, by the light in her eye, by the
movement of lip or hand. When her hand
was in yours it told you the thoughts of her
heart. Lucy was as near to being a pure

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

spirit as anybody could be in this world.</p>

<p>It was love at first sight with us both. I
knew it, the very moment I met her glance
in that wainscoted Twickenham parlour. She
was mine. She knew it also; a psithurism
seemed to pass through her, as when a full-foliaged
tree is caught by the wooing south
wind. But we were very quiet and polite
that afternoon, and neither Mrs. Lovelace
nor Captain Charles for one instant suspected
what was very well known to Lucy and me
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though without a word.</p>

<p>What a time it was! England against
the world! Nelson, flower of Admirals,
was at sea, longing to catch Bonaparte "on
a wind." Charlie was perpetually pining to
be on service; I hypocritically echoed his
longings, but had really no desire to have
the sea between me and Twickenham, to
which riverain village my horse's head turned

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

with diurnal regularity. Mrs. Lovelace soon
saw what was the matter with me, but she
had no objection. Why, indeed, should
she? I was a soldier, and Charlie's best
friend, and the owner of a great estate. In
those days a man's having lived pretty fast
did not make him an abomination in the
eyes of either young ladies or old ones.
Milksops were not popular.</p>

<p>My London cronies did not see quite as
much of me as of old, for almost every afternoon
was spent in Lucy's company, and
often I dined with Mrs. Lovelace instead of
returning to join the mess. Happy little
dinners! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though they were simple
enough&mdash;a bit of fish, and a joint of mutton,
perhaps, and an apricot tart, and a glass of
old Madeira. The Prince Regent had not
spoilt our dinner-tables by making that vile
fluid, sherry, fashionable. After dinner, on

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

clear Summer nights, the old lady would
obligingly fall asleep, and Lucy and I would
ramble down to the margin of the Thames,
and watch the reflection of moon and stars
in the restless river.</p>

<p>One night may stand for all. Charlie's having
dined with us that evening makes it more
strong in my memory; but he left soon after
dinner, having some engagement. The old
lady was soon serenely asleep in her customary
chair near an open window, through
which came fragrance of multitudinous roses.
Lucy loved roses; and the queen of flowers
seemed to return her love, for she always
had them in profusion. They grew in her
garden more profusely than I had ever seen
them anywhere, and in varieties more
numerous. Some vast masses of odour,
ruddy and inexhaustible, some pale and
delicate white, with just a blush in their

<!-- vol 1 page 51 -->

centre; some of crocus hue; some a dark
deep purple. Lucy's roses were the marvel
and envy of all her fair friends. Nobody
else could grow them in such profusion and
perfection. There was magic in it; the
nightingales came to sing among them; their
music this very night was thrilling through
the air. The moon was at its full this night.
One planet burnt near it; which of the two
chief planets I know not, being perfectly ignorant
of astronomy and astrology, and all such
matters. Only Mars I know, the soldier's
star, red as blood; and this night he shone
like a ruby in the cloudless blue. I had
noticed him a night or two before; so I had
gone to a jeweller's, and bought the finest
ruby I could find, and made the man set it
in a thin flat hoop of gold, that should suit
Lucy's delicate ring-finger. And this night,
as we strolled up and down in silence by the

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

never-silent Thames, I suddenly said: "Lucy,
which is your favourite star?"</p>

<p>She looked up into the sky with a dreamy,
questioning gaze.</p>

<p>"I am rather superstitious about the stars,"
she said. "My mother laughs at me for it.
The Bible says they were made 'for signs
and for seasons, and for days and for years.'
I think they have some strange influence. I
always have a tremulous excited feeling
when I look at the planet Mars."</p>

<p>"That means you are to be a soldier's
wife," I said, "and here is the ring of betrothal."</p>

<p>"O what a lovely ruby! Edward, how
extravagant you are! It is just the very
colour of the planet."</p>

<p>I put it on her finger, and pressed my
lips to her lovely hand. She was half
laughter, half tears. She leaned her fair
head on my breast.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

<p>"I hope this happiness will last," she
said. "But can such happiness last? I am
terrified lest it should come to a sad and
sudden end. Edward, be true to me."</p>

<p>"My darling child," I said, "I will be
true to you as long as the planet Mars endures.
Come, throw aside these fancies;
sing me one of your pretty little ballads."</p>

<p>She sat on a garden seat. My arm was
round her waist. She sang.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O songs of the olden time!
    That were so wondrous sweet,
When the world was a fairer clime,
    And the turf was cool to the feet,
    And the days fled all too fleet,
And lips had their low love-rhyme,
    When lovers were fain to meet:
O songs of the olden time!</p>

<p class="stanza">"O songs of the olden time!
    Who dares to sing them now?
For love may be turned to crime
    By the basely broken vow.
    And alas! we know not how
The marriage-bells may chime.
    'Tis a weary world, I trow,
O songs of the olden time!"</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

<p>"What a melancholy darling you are to-night!"
I said. "Come into the candle-light,
and give me a cup of coffee before I go,
and be cheerful. You must sing me a
merrier song to-morrow."</p>

<p>Lucy did as she was bid. An hour later
I rode townwards joyously, for she had
broken into her gayest mood of caprice and
merriment. We parted with a laughing
kiss. I rode gaily to town, sent my horses
home, strolled into Vandesme's, intending
supper only; played, broke the bank, won
twenty thousand; went home, and slept
right soundly.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">LUCY AND I.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O, my good lord, the world is but a word;
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
How quickly were it gone!"</p>

</div>

<p>NEXT morning, as I was at breakfast,
Charlie Lovelace came in; very
woe-begone he looked, and as if his immediate
intention were suicide. I knew every
phase of his countenance by this time, having
a real brotherly love for him. So,
when I saw him in this condition, I made
him drink some sparkling wine, and awaited
his confidence.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

<p>It was simple enough when it came. He
also had been playing the night before.
He had lost twelve thousand. He did not
see what he could do, unless he sold out,
and also sacrificed some freehold property
in Leicestershire.</p>

<p>I laughed at him.</p>

<p>"My dear Charlie," I said, "you are
absurd. What is twelve thousand pounds?
You know perfectly well that if I gave you
a cheque for that sum, Coutts's people
would honour it, whether or not I have so
much to my credit. But it does so happen
that I can put you out of your trouble at
once; for I broke the bank at Vandesme's
last night, and there are rolls of notes to the
amount of twenty thousand lying about
somewhere. The Villain can find them."</p>

<p>"You don't expect me to take this
money from you, Ned?" said Charlie.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

<p>"Why not? What I win or lose at play
I always consider <i>waste money</i>. I had a
run last night, and landed twenty thousand;
you happen to want twelve thousand of it&mdash;there
it is; the other eight I shall throw
away somehow."</p>

<p>Saying this, I told the Villain, who had
just brought in an omelet, to fetch a small
black bag from my dressing-room.</p>

<p>He obeyed orders. The bag was crammed
with bank-notes. I put it on the table,
and said to Charlie:</p>

<p>"Now, old fellow, take what you want."</p>

<p>He gave me a whimsical smile, and pulled
out a roll of notes.</p>

<p>"You are a good fellow, Ned," he remarked;
"but you are a devilish odd fellow.
Fancy having twenty thousand pounds in
your bag, and with the Villain close at
hand."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

<p>"I should have asked leave of absence
first, sir," said the Villain, with a grin. He
was a very honest Villain, I believe; at
any rate, the bank-notes were safe enough
on this occasion, and I gave the fellow a
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The value of money had never occurred
to me at that time. I had not mastered
the fact that every sovereign means so much
human labour&mdash;so much human life. A
rich man gives fifty pounds for a thing without
thinking that he is giving away a year
of somebody's existence. Yet it is so; every
piece of hard money is the mere representative
of human toil. O for a miracle to
make the gold we squander speak, and tell
us what hard work it represents!</p>

<p>Charlie, having been persuaded to take
what he needed, went away quietly. I was
only too glad that a run of luck had thus

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

enabled me to help him. I thought no
more about it. He did, I regret to say; he
felt himself under some sort of obligation&mdash;I
can't think why. If he hadn't had that
twelve thousand pounds, I should certainly
have thrown it away, as I have no doubt I
did the other eight, though on this point I
have no distinct recollection.</p>

<p>What chiefly I remember in that time
was my pleasant intercourse with my darling
Lucy. Her mother and Charlie both considered
her too young to marry, and she
and I obediently acquiesced in their decision,
though most assuredly it would have been
fortunate for us both if she had been pronounced
of matrimonial age. However, she
was not, and we had to play at love-making,
and we both enjoyed it very much indeed.</p>

<p>Given, a delicious rose-garden, sloping to
the Thames, and the lady of that garden a

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

creature of perfect beauty, and most loving
and loveable temper, is it not easily conceivable
that Major Sir Edward Ellesmere
was happy? As a fact, I was rather glad
that Lucy was not old enough yet. Cynical
sneerers had made me rather afraid of marriage.
It was a belief of those times that
the most charming girl in the world might,
when she became a wife, become also a
nuisance. I hardly know how to account
for the prevalence of this theory, but just
then it was the fashion with men to run
down women&mdash;to regard them as mere toys
and playthings&mdash;to maintain that they were
heartless and untrustworthy. These cynical
fashions of thought come round in cycles,
according, doubtless, to some hitherto undiscovered
law.</p>

<p>"Most women have no characters at all,"
wrote Alexander Pope; yet Pope had read

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

Shakespeare, in whose chief plays there is
not one woman without distinctive character.</p>

<p>Of course I was in the fashion, and professed
to regard women as below one's
notice, otherwise than as mere playthings.
I was obliged silently to recant every day
of my life, for every day of my life I saw
Lucy, and she taught me more in a night
than I ever learnt anywhere else in a year.
She was the very darling of nature. As I
have heretofore said, the roses seemed to
grow for her delight; and the nightingales
came to sing amid the roses, and Lucy and
I were happy. She had not a touch of
coquetry about her. She was mine; she
knew it, and was satisfied. Every night of
my life I came down to see her, and we
wandered into the garden in Summer, or
sat in the little library in Winter. Mrs.

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

Lovelace left us to our own devices. Ah!
it was a happy time!</p>

<p>I was in no hurry for wedlock. I like to
have this tremulous sweet virgin-flower my
own, uncrushed, unsoiled. She had given
herself to me, my Lucy, but I would not
take her yet; I would let her grow and
ripen, pass from girl to woman, from bud
to flower. It was only too delightful, this
happy, innocent converse with a beautiful,
simple creature like Lucy Lovelace.</p>

<p>One night I brought her some rhymes, to
the same air which she had fitted to most
melancholy words. Right gaily she sang
them.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O songs of the time unknown!
    That is coming, so sweet, so fair.
The time of the loosened zone,
    Of love in the Summer air.

Of nights passed never alone,
    Of a heart whose dreams I share.
O songs of the time unknown!</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

<p class="stanza">"O songs of the time unknown!
    They haunt the restless stream,

    Our joy shall be supreme.
O songs of the time unknown!"</p>

<p>Trivial rhymes, you will say, dear reader;
but what is trivial when a man's in love?
Heartily do I wish my worst offence against
my beautiful Lucy was making bad verses
about her! I could forgive myself for that,
seeing that every man is not born a poet.
But I cannot forgive myself for the way I
treated her; though I believe when we meet
again she will say she heartily forgives
me.</p>

<p>Looking back upon that happy time, I
have come to the definite conclusion that to
be in love is a man's highest fortune. It is
far better than to be an emperor or a millionaire.

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

The despot is in daily dread of
assassination; the owner of millions is in
hourly dread of being robbed or swindled.
The true lover has no dread; his wealth,
his empire, cannot be taken from him; it is
inalienable, inviolate.</p>

<p>So I say that the happiest time of a man's
life is not when he obtains distinction as
statesman, soldier, poet, what not; nor is it
when he finds a comfortable balance lodged
at his banker's, whereby he can snap his
fingers at his creditors; but it is when two
bright eyes look lovingly into his, and two
sweet lips are ready to be kissed, and a
warm white hand rests trustfully in his. I
am of opinion that we do not yet half understand
the philosophy and psychology of
sexual completion. Our modern sophists
are so anxious to prove the non-existence of
God and the monkey ancestry of man, that

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

questions of real importance are forgotten.
A Universe self-created is far less imaginable
than a creating Deity; a monkey made as a
caricature of man is far more probable than
the development of man from a monkey.
The thing cannot be done. Even a Darwin
could not be grown from the chimpanzee .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and there could be no easier form of the
experiment.</p>

<p>But, O ye philosophers and students of
life, there is room for great discovery in
connection with the higher nature of man.
It is not our relation toward the beasts that
perish which requires investigation; it is our
relation toward God, who created us in his
own image. Just at this moment we have
fallen on a time when sham science is rampant;
when anything new is accepted by all
the shallow thoughtless people whose minds
have no real culture. The man who argues

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

that we are mere developments of the lower
creatures finds hosts of admirers; his books
pass through many editions; his miserable
misrepresentations of nature are accepted
as absolute truth by persons who have never
observed nature. "The Divinity is an ape,
and behold! I am his prophet," is one man's
cry. Logic works no cure; fallacy is the
fashion, and with the multitude fashion is
stronger than either revelation or reason.</p>

<p>While I was tasting the joyous hours
with Lucy Lovelace, drinking the wine of
my young life, learning lessons of love from
her fragrant lips, I suddenly, for the first
time, came in contact with a very decided
annoyance. It reached me in the form of a
letter from that abominable old canting rascal,
Ezra Sykes, to whom I had carelessly
left the management of my estates, and who
had hitherto always sent me money with

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

promptitude. Having occasion for a few
thousands in a hurry, I despatched the Villain
down to Ellesmere, with an order to Sykes to
get it. To my amazement, he returned next
day without it, but with a note from this
rascal Ezra, saying that my income had been
greatly exceeded, that there was no balance
in hand, that he would endeavour to raise
the money at interest in a few weeks! A
few weeks!&mdash;to me who had never had to
wait an instant for money! Well for Ezra
Sykes he was miles away, or I would have
horsewhipped the truth out of the old hypocrite.
Of course I had kept no accounts&mdash;why
should I, with my princely income? I
decided at once that Sykes was a thief, and
sent the Villain off again with a letter, threatening
him with my severest vengeance if he
did not at once send the money.</p>

<p>"If the fellow does not at once send the

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

money," were my last words to my unscrupulous
servitor, "bring him. Strap him on
to a horse, if necessary; I'll hold you harmless."</p>

<p>The Villain rode off with an obedient grin
on his countenance, that augured ill for Ezra
Sykes.</p>

<p>He was off, and I was thinking of a ride to
Twickenham, when a servant came in to ask
if I could receive Mr. Norton. I said yes&mdash;I
did not connect the name with my old
schoolfellow, of whom I had seen nothing
since I left Eton. But when the man entered,
I knew him at once. He was oppressively
overdressed, and wore, over a white
satin waistcoat, an immense gold cable,
attached to a watch the size of a half-guinea.
His coat was black velvet, with a collar of
sable; his breeches were fawn-coloured
kerseymere; the diamonds on his fingers

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

were about the size of those in his shoe-buckles.
His hair was redder, his eyes
greener, his hands dirtier, his knees weaker,
than they used to be at Eton.</p>

<p>Now what could this fellow want? I
was in no mood to be civil to him. I was
wroth with Sykes; I was eager to quiet myself
in the peaceful company of Lucy. I
felt quite out of humour with Norton and
Co., and showed it unmistakably.</p>

<p>But Norton's plausibility and humility
were too much for me. He was a Belial-Iago.
He congratulated me on my fashionable
distinction, my brilliant career, my fame
for wit, my success among the ladies. The
strongest of us are accessible to flattery; I, in
those days, was very weak; I have become
hard as heart of oak since. This Norton,
whom in my inmost soul I utterly contemned,
managed to cajole me with his fulsome

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

flattery. I tolerated his red hair, green
eyes, and grimy hands&mdash;because he told me
pleasant lies.</p>

<p>By-and-by he introduced a subject that
at that moment was for the first time interesting
to me&mdash;money. He delicately
remarked that, although I had a noble
estate, I might sometimes be pressed for a
trifle; and that he was connected with
a large financial firm that always had money
at the service of their clients.</p>

<p>Fool that I was, it never occurred to me
that this fellow was in league with Ezra
Sykes. I took his opportune arrival as a
fortunate dispensation of Providence. I
borrowed ten thousand pounds of him,
giving merely an I O U. He seemed to
consider I did him quite a favour by accepting
it, and withdrew from my rooms a perfect
incarnation of humbleness.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

<p>I sent two hundred pounds of this money
to a girl named Laura Scarth, whom I had
met a few evenings before in the streets.
She was the daughter of one of my father's
tenants. I remembered her quite a child&mdash;a
pretty little blue-eyed thing. She had
grown up too pretty, and come to sorrow,
and broken the heart of old Michael Scarth,
her father. She recognised me and spoke
to me. She seemed passionately eager
to lead an honest life, and thought she
could set up a small shop if she had a little
money. I sent her this two hundred pounds,
and I believe she used it prudently, and
rescued herself from degradation. But my
detractors made this act of charity a ground
of assault on my character.</p>

<p>Foreseeing nothing of the unpleasant
future, I took horse, and was soon with my
beautiful Lucy, among the roses and nightingales.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">LADY DIANA CRE&Ccedil;I.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Que voulez-vous, Diane bonne,
        Que vous donne?
Vous n'eustes, comme j'entends,
Jamais taut d'heur au printemps
        Qu'en automne?"</p>

</div>

<p>PLANTAGENET AQUILA, Marquis of
Cre&ccedil;i, was the descendant of a race
whose men were always <i>sans peur et sans
reproche</i>, while the women were generally
<i>sans peur</i> only. The Cre&ccedil;is, a very old
Catholic family, Hereditary Grand-Masters
of the Revels of the Crown, were prouder
than prelates and poorer than church mice.

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

The young Marquis, who was about my
own age, was living a careless brilliant life
in London at this time, with no perceptible
income except what he won at play; and
certainly his luck was amazing. It was he
indeed who had cleared out Charlie Lovelace,
that time when I was able to help
him; and it was through Charlie that some
time after I made his lordship's acquaintance.</p>

<p>I certainly never met any one so brilliant&mdash;not
with wit, for he had not a
scintilla, but by reason of his inexhaustible
animal spirits, his gay daring, his passionate
delight in adventure. He had a clear blue
eye, a keen classic face, a splendid agile
figure. The wildest dissipation did not
affect his health. He was the most perfect
specimen of the human animal I ever
knew.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

<p>My acquaintance with him would have
been comparatively unimportant, had it not
led to my knowing Lady Diana Cre&ccedil;i, his
father's youngest sister. This lady was
certainly the most notable person of her sex
in London at the time. She was not young;
the polite <i>Peerage</i> told not her age, but I
fancy she was nearer forty than thirty. She
had however the family health and spirits,
and was a very skilful artist in self-adornment.
She was not handsome; but her figure was
good, and she possessed a wondrous wealth
of hair, the very colour of Californian gold.
She was not clever; indeed she knew
nothing, and spelt abominably; but she was
the most fascinating woman I ever met. I
have said she knew nothing; but she certainly
<i>did</i> know every trick of coquetry,
every artifice of dress, every device invented
by women to make themselves irresistible.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

<p>Lady Diana had a small house in Kensington;
it was called Bijou. It stood in the
centre of about an acre of lawn and garden,
surrounded by a wall eight feet high. It
had a cloister all round it, and four rooms
on the ground-floor all opening into each
other, and two conservatories, one on each
side, which were entered from the reception
rooms by crossing the cloister. Here was
always a wonderful show of the choicest
flowers; and rare birds flitted about in large
cages. The kitchens, offices, servants'
apartments, stables, were at the rear, approached
through a corridor.</p>

<p>Charlie Lovelace, making acquaintance
through the Marquis with Lady Diana, was
soon fascinated. She had the power of
magnetising men. After a while she commanded
Charlie to bring me to Bijou, wanting,
as I presumed at the time, to make an experiment

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

on a new victim. I did not till
afterwards learn that she had a cruel pleasure
in fascinating men whom she knew to
be engaged, and proving to her own satisfaction
that she had more attractive power than
the pretty girls of a younger generation.</p>

<p>When Charlie pressed me to accept an
invitation to Bijou, I reminded him that my
evenings all belonged to his sister.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" says Charlie. "She'll
give you up for one night, and glad; I dare
say you're boring her. Depend upon it, old
fellow, it's a mistake for you to see so much
of each other; you'll find out all one another's
faults before marriage&mdash;and you may just as
well leave it till after."</p>

<p>As I knew that Lucy had no faults, and
was quite ready to forgive mine, this argument
did not touch me; but Charlie was so
resolute that at last I gave way. That evening,

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

amid the roses and the nightingales, I
told Lucy that her brother and I had an important
engagement on the coming Wednesday,
and that I should not be able to come
down.</p>

<p>"Well, Edward," she said, "I am so used
to your coming every night that it will seem
quite strange. But no; I tell you what you
shall do; you shall come and dine with us.
Mamma will give you a roast fowl and a
bottle of poor papa's favourite Madeira, and
you can go straight from here to meet
Charlie. We dine at five, you know; and I
suppose your engagement is some hours
later."</p>

<p>"Nine, my darling," I said. As her
sweet face, luminous with love, looked up
into mine, I felt a strange sharp presentiment
that I was about to do a very foolish
thing in deserting her for one night only. I

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

dreaded it. I felt disposed to throw Lady
Diana over, and to pursue my customary
course; but then Charlie had my promise.
He laughed at me a good deal when I told
him that I was going to dine at Twickenham
on the evening in question.</p>

<p>"You're a regular Romeo," he said. "I
hope the mater's wine won't poison you."</p>

<p>Wednesday came; we had our little
dinner together, and enjoyed it. Mrs.
Lovelace was slightly didactic; she always
deemed it her duty to drop pearls of wisdom
into the ears of any young men whom
she got at the dinner-table, whence of course
they could not escape, and it may be
guessed that her very choicest pearls were
reserved for her future son-in-law. However,
I always enjoyed the dear old lady's
clever lectures; but I could hardly keep
from laughing when, at intervals, I saw Lucy

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

making a pretty little wicked grimace at
me.</p>

<p>I had something beside roast fowl to eat,
and the wine was by no means what that
rascal Charlie wanted me to anticipate,

"Now, sir," said Lucy, bringing me with
her own pretty hands a cup of fragrant
Mocha, "have you dined well? <i>I</i> arranged
that dinner, and I expect you to praise me.
How do you like red mullet with sauce of
capers and periwinkles? I am sure you
never tasted it before."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I never did."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought not. Well, did you like
the young pigeons on anchovy toast, with
Muscat grapes?"</p>

<p>"They were delicious, my own Lucy;
but why are you asking me these questions?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to know whether I can

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

arrange a good enough dinner for you. Do
you suppose I have not learnt that man's
chief idea is dinner and politics, just as woman's
chief idea is tea and gossip? It is all
very well to talk about love&mdash;you and I
are very much in love, I know; but then,
you see, we shall have to dine together so
many times! Suppose we should live together
fifty years&mdash;and I have heard of such
things&mdash;why, that would be nearly twenty
thousand dinners!"</p>

<p>The child was in one of her mad moods.
I knew how it would be. She was all
action and re-action; life was to her like the
flow and ebb of the tide beneath the mischievous
magnetic mysterious moon. I felt
only too certain that when I left her she
would grow melancholy. Very loath I was
to leave her, but the thing had to be done,
and, at about eight, I was on horseback,
bound for Bijou and Lady Diana.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

<p>There was no gateway to Bijou&mdash;no carriage-entrance;
you passed through a quiet
green door in the high wall, and were at
once in a most perfect garden. That night,
even after Lucy's roses, the fragrance of
Lady Diana's parterres seemed wonderful.
I have since seen her gardens in the sunshine,
and they seemed to me more original
and various than any other of which I have
had experience.</p>

<p>Bijou was brilliantly lighted. At the
threshold I met Charlie, who had been
awaiting me, and who forthwith presented
me to the hostess. At first sight I thought
her grotesque, but after a little conversation
I forgot her undeniable ugliness, and began
to think her a very fine woman. She had
a mellow voice; she had suggestive eyes;
she had unlimited capacity for lying. She
was a female Mephistopheles.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

<p>Her reception this night took the form of
a kind of artistic conversazione. Some
painters and sculptors whom she patronized
had brought their most recent work. We
were all divided between a picture by Jack
Easel, of Ares and Aphrodite caught in the
golden net of Hephaistos, and a statue by
Claudius Chisel, of the divine bull with
Europa on his back, preparing to swim the
Bosphorus.</p>

<p>"Which do you like best?" said Lady
Diana to me.</p>

<p>"I like both equally," was my answer.
"They are real works of genius."</p>

<p>And, indeed, so they were. Later in the
evening I managed to get a few quiet
minutes with the artists, bought both picture
and statue for a few hundred pounds, and
determined to offer them to Lady Diana. I
had some difficulty in making this arrangement,

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

for her lively ladyship kept me by her
side as much as she could. She quite snubbed
poor Charlie, who, to my great amusement,
was immensely jealous. Of course,
with the customary contrariety of human
nature, I did all I could to increase this
jealousy. It never occurred to me that I
was treading on ground doubly dangerous.</p>

<p>There was a brilliant supper in one of the
rooms. Lady Diana put her hand on my
arm when it was announced, and made it
clear to the assembly that I was the favoured
cavalier that evening. Charlie went off to
the other end of the table, where he got
between two middle-aged blue-stockings,
who treated him with ferocious affectionateness.
Evidently, till my arrival, he had
been Lady Diana's favourite&mdash;now he felt
dethroned. I had made up my mind I
cared not twopence for Lady Liana, but I

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

could not help being gallant and deferential
to her, just to spite Charlie, who pretended
indifference, but at intervals looked as if he
would like to meet me with pistol or rapier.
Supper ended, there was a general gathering
of the guests to take leave. I was about
to do the same, but Lady Diana said, in a
whisper,</p>

<p>"Stay a little longer."</p>

<p>So I stayed. I was not sorry, for I
wanted to see whether she would accept my
presents, which I had told one of her servants
to place where she would see them.
Charlie, I observed, did not come to take
leave of Lady Diana&mdash;whence I judged that
he was decidedly in love, and wondered at
his choice. She was fascinating, doubtless,
but I, who had known Lucy, could not think
of Lady Diana otherwise than as a mere
soulless heartless creature, witty and wicked.

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

I should have saved myself unutterable
agony if I had acted on my intuitive knowledge
of her character, and left her to
Charlie, or anybody else that might fancy
her.</p>

<p>The brilliant company gradually left.</p>

<p>The last straggler, an undecided gentleman,
who could not find his gloves, was
eventually disposed of. A footman lighted
us up stairs to a lovely boudoir, in which
every article was beautiful in material and
workmanship. As I entered, I saw that
Easel's picture and Chisel's statue had been
brought hither.</p>

<p>Lady Diana sank into a low lounging
chair, and then caught sight of Aphrodite
and Europa.</p>

<p>"I wonder why these are left behind?"
she said, languidly.</p>

<p>I explained to her that I had bought them,

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

and hoped she would accept them. She
looked at me for a minute.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I will accept them. I
like your gentlemanly generosity to a lady
you never saw before. I am afraid you are
too generous. I have heard a great deal of
you, Sir Edward, or I should not have told
Captain Lovelace to bring you here. By
the way, what do you think of Captain
Lovelace?"</p>

<p>"He is my most intimate friend, and I
have the highest opinion of him."</p>

<p>"Distrust him, Sir Edward," she said;
"he is a disappointed man, and disappointed
men are never safe. Besides, I am sure you
have done him some great service, he always
speaks of you so bitterly."</p>

<p>"What, Charlie!" I exclaimed, in amazement.
"Why, we are the best friends in the
world."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

<p>She laughed; not a pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't trust your best friend too far," she
said; "I am told that you are to marry his
sister. Tell me what she is like."</p>

<p>It appeared to me profanation to describe
my beautiful pure Lucy to this cynical
woman of the world; so I excused myself
by saying that I was a bad hand at description.</p>

<p>"You will never marry her," she said,
laughing lightly.</p>

<p>"Who will prevent me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Your best friend, Captain Lovelace. He
hates you, Sir Edward. I knew that from
his references to you, and for that reason I
made him bring you here. I am rather
sorry for him; with a career before him he
might have been a good fellow. He'll break
off your engagement with Miss Lucy, depend
on it."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 88 -->

<p>"I am not afraid," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course not. I despise a man who is
afraid of anything in the world. But this
fellow will beat you, Sir Edward, if you do
not play a very clever game."</p>

<p>"I am sure of Lucy," I said.</p>

<p>"Is she as sure of you?"</p>

<p>Just then a waiting woman brought in a
silver tray with a few anchovy sandwiches
and Presburg biscuits, and chocolate and
liqueurs.</p>

<p>"This is my real supper," quoth Lady
Diana. "What we had down stairs was a
mere sham."</p>

<p>So she took a sandwich and a glass of
maraschino.</p>

<p>"Do you drive four-in-hand, Edward?"
she asked. She had dropped the "Sir" and
become quite familiar.</p>

<p>"O yes," I replied; "I can drive."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

<p>"I am very glad. Are you engaged to-morrow?
If not, come here at two. I've
just bought such a lovely roan team, a
beautiful match, but the off leader is much
too frisky. I want to try them to-morrow
afternoon. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"With infinite pleasure," I said. "Two
o'clock. I'll be here, and your most humble
servant; but I suspect you can manage four
horses better than I."</p>

<p>"We shall see to-morrow," she said with
an amused smile. "Now you must go, or I
shall lose my character. Be off with you!"</p>

<p>My horses were waiting at the garden gate.
I rode home and went to bed; but I'll be
hanged if I could sleep. Lady Diana Cre&ccedil;i
was too stupendous a study of character.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">FOUR-IN-HAND.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum
Collegisse juvat, metaque fervidis
Evitata rotis palmaque nobilis
Terrarum doninos evehit ad Deos."</p>

</div>

<p>I HAVE met many people who could see
nothing delightful in driving four-in-hand.
To such folk I say&mdash;<i>Try it, if you
dare</i>. No man can do it who has not an
intelligent left hand, which is a very rare
endowment. Gather up the ribbons: the
horses know in an instant whether they have
a master. And the intelligent left must

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

have as partner a dexterous right hand, so
guided by a quick eye that a horse can at
once be admonished by a stinging touch on
exactly the right point. Till you can cut
down a wasp on the wing with the very end
of the long lash, do not try to drive four-in-hand.</p>

<p>That I was punctual, may be supposed.
When I reached the gate of Bijou, I recognised
Charlie's horses being led up and down,
and naturally supposed that he was to join
the party; but just as I was about to ring
the bell, Charlie came rapidly out, stared at
me as if he hardly knew me, threw himself
on his horse, and galloped away.</p>

<p>Having long been of opinion, from experience
of myself and of others, that we all
have our mad moments, I took no notice
whatever of Charlie's vagaries. The madder
a man is, the sooner he comes to his

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

senses. It is your slow lunatic that is a
nuisance; the man who gradually grows
mad, and who has to be cured even more
gradually. That is not the sort of fellow
Shakespeare meant when he classed together
"the lunatic, the lover, and the poet."</p>

<p>I entered the house, and was received by
Lady Diana, who was just finishing her preparations.
She had on a rose-coloured silk
dress, adorned with most miraculous lace;
but, as I came in, her attendants were cruelly
hiding it beneath a many-caped similitude
of a coachman's coat, built of drab velvet.
Then she placed on her head a broad-brimmed
beaver hat, and, turning round to
me, said, with a laugh and a curtsey,</p>

<p>"Now don't I look the real thing?"</p>

<p>"Lovely," I said. "You might drive the
Chariot of the Sun."</p>

<p>"Too airy a trip," she replied. "I should

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

smash the whole Zodiac. But come, I hope
you won't be ashamed to sit on the box with
me?"</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted. I have never seen
a lady drive four-in-hand yet, and it will be
quite a treat."</p>

<p>"Ah! well, you differ from your great
friend Captain Lovelace. He has just been
scolding me for the extraordinary things I
do, and went off in a huff because I laughed
at him. He is quite jealous of you: he
need not be; he ought to know by this time
that I only amuse myself by finishing the
education of boys like you and him. You
have no idea how many boys I have educated.
But come, they ought to be ready for
us!"</p>

<p>At the garden-gate stood a beautifully-appointed
coach, with dark body and red
wheels&mdash;helpers at the heads of the four

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

roans; three grooms ready to mount behind&mdash;one
of them dressed like a mail-guard.
Lady Diana always carried out her caprices
so thoroughly that people wondered almost
as much where she got her money as where
she got her ideas.</p>

<p>She mounted to the box-seat as easily as
if she had been a Jehu born&mdash;and if anybody
caught a glimpse of her ankles, they
were very pretty ones. The reins and whip
were handed her; she gave the off-leader a
touch under the ear to remind him that his
mistress had him in hand; and away we
went, eleven good miles an hour, while the
groom-guard blew a startling peal on a
silver horn an ell long. All the vicinage
turned out to see the sight.</p>

<p>Soon we were beyond the suburbs, briefer
and less populous by far than in these days.
It was a most delicious Summer afternoon;

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

the Thames was clear and bright as we
crossed the hideous bridge at Putney. Full
of excitement was the air as we rattled over
the heath beyond. The roans went well;
the silver horn rang through the air; Lady
Diana laughed and chatted and sang, till I
began to forget her age, and to think she
must be a mere girl, after all.</p>

<p>I had never much geography about me;
I knew nothing of London south of the
Thames, and so I could only wonder where
Lady Diana was taking me. It was a lovely
drive, but a long one; three times, I
think, we stopped to rest and bait the
horses. We were among beautiful green
hills at last, with tall ferns by the wayside,
and a clear shallow stream, in which I could
see the trout, crossing the road at intervals.
We began to descend a hill so steep that
the skid was necessary. In the valley we

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

pulled up in front of a quaint old inn, with
a wide archway, under which we drove, and
galleries all round the inner court. It was
as if Chaucer's Tabard had been removed
into the country.</p>

<p>There were plenty of people to help the
grooms with the horses, and in the side
entrance, under the archway, stood the stout
landlord, with a portly wife and a ruddy-faced
daughter, making obeisance each in
their own way The yard was full of
bustle&mdash;waggons loading and unloading,
and, just as we had arrived, an up-mail
stopped to change horses, and there was a
rush of travellers for refreshment. Lady
Diana, in her coachman's cape and wide-brimmed
hat, was an astonishing apparition;
but she was soon out of sight, turning to
me as she went upstairs with the landlord's
daughter, and saying, gaily,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

<p>"Don't you want your dinner?"</p>

<p>On reflection, I did. I had taken nothing
all the way down, and was hungry,
but more especially athirst. I said to the
burly landlord, who, though immense, was
well-grown, and did not waddle in his gait,
or run to abdomen,</p>

<p>"What's the name of your inn?"</p>

<p>"The 'Cre&ccedil;i Arms,' your honour. Look
at the sign."</p>

<p>It hung right across the road, as you may
see them to this day, I believe, at Croydon
and Temple Cloud, and the sun was upon
it, and threw up the emblazonment of the
arms of Cre&ccedil;i, with the haughty motto,
"<i>Dux regit examen</i>."</p>

<p>"Is your ale as good as your sign?" I
asked. "I have drunken nothing since I
left town."</p>

<p>The landlord left the room with greater

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

alacrity than I should have expected from a
man of his weight, and returned in about
five minutes with a quart tankard of silver,
bearing also the Cre&ccedil;i arms, and full to the
foam-kissed brim of that amber fluid which
all Englishmen love.

"That's some of the Marquis's birth-day
ale," said the landlord with a grin, "It's
fine stuff."</p>

<p>As Cre&ccedil;i had been of age some years, I
at once guessed this was fine ale, and my
anticipation was amply fulfilled. It passed
the palate with exquisite softness; it filled the
frame with a healthy warmth; it nimbly
reached the brain and stimulated the forgettive
faculty. I was grateful to mine host,
for I wanted to be ready for a gay encounter
with Lady Diana, and this grand
beverage, the happy gift of Demeter and
Dionysus, had just supplied my mental and

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

physical need. I thought of the famous
apostrophe of a poet of the period:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">            "Hear, O hear!
Dionysus and Demeter!
            Give, O give
Wine and bread that a poet may live!
            All Olympus I disdain,
            If I get the gifts of this glorious twain."

</div>

<p>Now the unique beauty of ale is that it is
wine and bread in one. Demeter, Dionysus,
and Co.'s entire.</p>

<p>Just at this moment there came across me
the feeling that I was further from London
than I ought to be, and that my chance of seeing
Lucy Lovelace that evening was slight.
When I accepted Lady Diana's invitation, it
was with the notion of a short drive out of
town; but I was at least twenty-five miles
away. When this thought came suddenly
upon me, Lady Diana passed from my mind,
and my sole idea was to get to Twickenham,

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

to see Lucy. I made inquiries. The
last stage coach had passed just as we arrived.
There was a mail up at twelve. I
could have post horses, but a glance at them
showed they would not reach London till
midnight.</p>

<p>I was very angry with myself for having
thoughtlessly got into this difficulty. I saw
no one else to blame. I did not know then
what I know now&mdash;that Lady Diana Cre&ccedil;i
planned the trip to keep me away from
Lucy, and that she had a bet of a hundred
guineas on the event. With whom, think
you? With my friend Captain Charles
Lovelace. However, Lady Diana cared nothing
for the hundred guineas, but it absolutely
delighted her wicked heart to wile a
man away from a girl who loved him. That
idiot, Charlie, had told her of my devotion
to Lucy; she, <i>diablesse</i>, resolved to interfere.

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

These things I found out afterwards. That
night I accused Lady Diana of nothing
worse than a wild caprice. Had I known!</p>

<p>When I came back from my foiled investigation,
I ascended the quaint black oak
staircase of the old inn, which was brilliantly
lighted. A large room on the first floor
was shown me, where preparations for
dinner were made; in the window stood
Lady Diana, looking out upon the sunlit
afternoon, dressed in white muslin, with
roses in her hair. She certainly had the
art of looking marvellously young. As she
stood with her back to me in the bay
window, her long hair wreathed with roses,
her white arms bared girlishly, one might
have thought she was a mere girl. This
was her policy. She went in for immortal
youth. She died many years ago, wherefore
I may candidly criticize her character.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

<p>My step caused her to turn, and I saw
that she was dressed for conquest.</p>

<p>"Ah! Sir Edward," she said, "what do
you think of the Cre&ccedil;i Arms? I am going
to teach you that a good dinner is obtainable
at a country inn."</p>

<p>"If it bears your name," I said, "I would
fight the man who dared question its cookery
or its wines. Diana Cre&ccedil;i means perfection."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are making fun of me, I see.
Never mind; I shall have my revenge."</p>

<p>"Revenge!" I said, pretending alarm&mdash;"don't
be too cruel."</p>

<p>"No, I shall simply give you so good a
dinner that you will be compelled to admit
all women are not always fools."</p>

<p>She did so; it was a real good dinner for
a country inn. Even the wine was sound.
I was not very loquacious during dinner; I

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

was all the time speculating on my companion's
character. There seemed something
entirely original about it. All that time I
had not caught any infection from the
superstitious epidemic which crops up at
intervals. If I had, I might have imagined
Lady Diana influenced of unseen spirits&mdash;some
working good, and some evil. The
idea did not occur to me. I regarded her
as a very fine, but rather uncanny specimen
of the human race. The under-current in
her temper was as carefully concealed as
cats conceal their claws.</p>

<p>The port of the Cre&ccedil;i Arms was undeniable,
and I enjoyed it greatly. There was
quite an artistic dessert, and the waiters
were as easy and dexterous as one's own
men-servants. Travel in the open air makes
a man hungry and drowsy; I was in a state
that seemed half-way between apathy and

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

felicity. We chatted pleasantly enough
through dinner; quite abruptly Lady Diana
said,</p>

<p>"When are you to be married, Sir Edward?"</p>

<p>The question took me entirely by surprise,
but I knew Lady Diana well enough
to be aware that she could stand a joke on
such a topic; so I simply said,</p>

<p>"I have a blank licence in my pocket&mdash;may
I put in the name of Lady Diana
Cre&ccedil;i?"</p>

<p>"No, you may not, you audacious boy!
But of course you talk nonsense when you
are so young. How dare you attempt to
flirt with me, when you are in love with
Charlie Lovelace's little sister? Don't go
about on false pretences; consider yourself
married, then you will cease to be dangerous."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

<p>"Am I dangerous?" I asked. "I never
thought so."</p>

<p>"Did you ever read the <i>Beaux' Stratagem?</i>"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;played Archer in it once."</p>

<p>"Ah! then you remember the catechism
of love, and the little catechized girl?
Now let me catechize you. Answer, on
pain of not getting another bottle of port."</p>

<p>"Terrible punishment!" I said. "I will
do my best."</p>

<p>So the catechism began:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;Are you in love?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;Do you love the lady, or
the creature you imagine her to be?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Both.</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;Be good enough to explain
that answer.</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Easily. I love in the lady the

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

beautiful character which I perceive in her,
and I purge that character in my imagination
of all the trivial stains given by the
world; and so I love her both as she is to-day,
and as she will be in the infinite to-morrow.
She is a lovely bud just now; I
love the bud, and also love the future
flower.</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;Does the bud return this
sentimental affection of yours?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I disown the epithet <i>sentimental</i>,
and I think it wrong to "kiss and tell."</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;You are not the least use
in the world to catechize. I have set up a
Christmas catechism class at my little place
in the country. I shall make you join that
class, and learn the eternal verities in words
of one syllable.</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I like words of one syllable. I
also like the eternal verities. The combination

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

must be something perfect. I will join
your class with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;Ah! but I am afraid you
are one of the wicked, and my Christmas
class is made up of innocent creatures of
both sexes. You would come among them
like Satan in Eden.</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I feel flattered, Lady Diana. I
always rather admired Satan, as a resolute
rebel, who must have known from the first
he had no chance. At the same time, I
thought it was hardly worth his while to
trouble himself about such very weak creatures
as the parents of the human race seem
to have been.</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;Then you don't think much
of the human race?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I don't think much of Adam and
Eve; they were hardly equal to you and
me. The race has improved. I have no

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

doubt that in a few generations we shall
arrive at something much finer. Science,
you know, must have its effect. There is a
scheme for manufacturing children by steam.
Don't you think it would be a great improvement?</p>

<p><i>Lady Diana</i>.&mdash;What dreadful nonsense
you talk, Sir Edward! But it is growing
late; I think I shall go to bed.</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and she was lighted to
her room. It was past midnight. I, however,
had decided that I would not pass my
night at this place. I was restless. I was
disgusted at not having seen Lucy. Going
downstairs, I found no one about but an
"odd man," who apparently took an occasional
nap in the coal-cellar; him I aroused,
and made him find the key of the stables.
On examination, it appeared that the only
animal with an ounce of go in him was Lady

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

Diana's troublesome off-leader; so I made the
man saddle that unfortunate animal, and
gave him a guinea, with instructions not to
know anything of what had happened. He
leered at me with a wide-mouthed grin of
such inimitable immeasurable stupidity that
I knew my instructions would be obeyed.</p>

<p>It was a moonless night, but the sky was
full of stars. Orion had written his autograph
of three initials firmly across the sky.
The six Pleiades were radiant, regardless of
their lost sister. Sirius was doing his best
to look as bright as Venus, and failing
utterly. The Milky Way was like unto the
cream of Devon. I rode along in a pleasant
mood, the soft night air cooling me after
my dinner and wine, while a myriad odours
came from the wild-flowers in hedgerow
and on open common.</p>

<p>Never had I a pleasanter ride. All the

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

while I thought of Lucy Lovelace. Her
brown hair and violet eyes haunted me; the
wild-flower fragrance made me remember
the roses that she loved, and that seemed to
love her in return. I compared her with
this witch of a woman who had lured me
away. What a chasm lay between them!
Lady Diana was false to the core, anybody
might see. She was always playing a part.
There was no iota of truth in her. She was
all intrigue and man&oelig;uvre. As I rode
along beneath the starlit sky, the figure of
my darling Lucy was before me. The old
roan plodded along, his skittishness quite
lost; the stars shone clear; the Cre&ccedil;i Arms
and Lady Diana were left behind, while in
front of me shone, in divine purity, the perfect
form of Lucy Lovelace, her exquisite
spiritual beauty seen through her fair undulations
of form.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 111 -->

<p>I did not hurry. It was about three in
the morning when I reached Pall Mall, and
rang up the Villain. He might possibly
have been surprised to see me, if anything
could have surprised him. He wasn't. He
took the unhappy horse in charge, and
walked off with it to some mews or other,
while I, feeling reflective, opened a bottle
of Champagne, which, with a biscuit, carried
me to bed.</p>

<p>When the morning came I was in an uncertain
state. I lay and thought over the
position. Church bells rang (it was Sunday,
as it sometimes is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the arithmetical equation
of Sunday is 142,857), and I wished,
with Voltaire, that the ringers had round
their necks what they held in their hands.
Sunday in London is dreadful, and always
has been dreadful. The middle class puts
on its best clothes. The worst of it is that

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

the best clothes of the middle class cannot
be persuaded to fit.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I decided not to
get up just yet. I rang for the Villain, and
got a bottle of hock, and some prawns.
This light breakfast (always a favourite of
mine) I took quietly in bed. The Villain
had brought me the <i>John Bull</i> newspaper,
and I laughed greatly over Theodore Hook's
wild rhymes. I quite agree with Coleridge
that Theodore was as great a genius as Dante.
That unerring untiring faculty of improvisation
is the sign of wondrous intellectual
force. Thackeray and Dickens, rolled into
one, had not the power of my friend Theodore
Hook.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I turned out, went
to White's, met a few friends, showed myself,
in fact. When evening came I rode
down to Twickenham. Rather to my surprise,

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

Charlie Lovelace was there; not often
did he show himself in the company of his
mother and sister. But he was here to-night,
and he, too, looked grieved, and my
beautiful darling Lucy looked perplexed.</p>

<p>I took extremely slight notice of my old
friend and his mother. I talked to my own
sweet love. I explained her that I had
been kept away by an accident. Her lovely
blue eyes told me at once that she believed
and forgave.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Strong sighs the sexless woman heaves,
    And in a whirl of fight she lives:
Happier the woman who believes,
    Happier the woman who forgives.</p>

<p class="stanza">That man is weak full well we know:
    We also know that man is strong;
The weakest man will strike a blow

<p class="stanza">'Neath workman's cap or soldier's helm
    Always let loyal blood appear;
And be the maxim of the Realm,

</div>

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

<p>My darling Lucy was very good. We
went, out into the rose-garden. O how the
roses smelt! O how the nightingales sang!
O how my sweet little love delighted me
with her rare and ineffable freshness and
beauty! Lucy! She was like a wild-flower&mdash;a
lovely May lily, such as in my
boyhood I used to find in Birchanger
Wood. Lucy was just as pure and white
and fragrant as those wild lilies of May.
Lucy was a very foolish little girl (dear
Lucy!), as the event will prove&mdash;she gave
me no end of trouble; she made me live
many years of lonely misery; but for all
that Lucy was the sweetest brightest
happiest girl in the world! Ah me, how
well I remember her! The years pass, the
girls fade, the senses weaken, the spirit
which God gives to man grows stronger as it
approaches its next movement through the

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

infinite universe. I have good reason to
know this, as my story will show.</p>

<p>Little Lucy did not say much as to what
was the matter with her mother and
Charlie; and I, being perfectly happy in
her company, asked no questions. It would
have been better if I had. But I merely
thought that Charlie was jealous of me with
Lady Diana, and wondered much at his
taste, and then forgot everything but Lucy.
Ah me, it was the last of my happy evenings
at Twickenham, and I shall remember
it throughout eternity. Some memories are
imperishable. The musical lapse of Thames,
the sweet song of the Daulian minstrel, the
bright soft eyes of my lovely Lucy, remain
on my memory. Ay, that night I was
happy! Well saidst thou, glorious John&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,
But what has been has been, and I have had my hour."</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

<p>That hour in that garden with Lucy was
worth a millennium of common life. Laugh
if you will, you who cannot understand
love in its purity, love that is beyond passion
and appetite, as the star is beyond the
fire, love that can flourish without words,
without kisses, without anything but the
magnetic interpenetration of two spirits that
have become one. You don't understand it,
madam? Well, then, take Sir Anthony
Absolute's advice, and, when you marry,
begin with a little aversion.</p>

</div>

<p>CHARLIE had left when we came in from
the garden, and Mrs. Lovelace was
gone to bed with a headache. How I hate
women who are capable of such meanness
as going to bed with a headache! Lucy came
down with me to the garden gate, where my
man was waiting with the horses, and as I

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

touched her red little rosebud of a mouth I
saw that there was a diamond tear in her
eye. But she took leave of me cheerfully,
and ran gaily back to the house, singing
some whimsical song. I wonder what I
should have done that night had I known
how long it would be before I should see
her again. <i>Clara luce refulsit</i>.</p>

<p>I rode slowly home. Next day I was on
duty. We were suddenly ordered to Windsor;
the King was going down. I sent a
messenger with a note to Lucy, saying that I
should not be able to see her that evening.
I felt rather savage; I am loyal, but what is
your king to your sweetheart? At the same
time, I know His Majesty would have given
me leave of absence if he had known I was
in love. Perhaps if it had been Charles II.
instead of George III. I might have plucked
up courage and told him.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

<p>I dined at mess that night. Colonel
Darell presided. We all liked the old
Colonel, for he was as fearless as a lion and
as gentle as a lady. The evening would have
been pleasant enough, but that Charlie Lovelace,
who was seated nearly opposite me,
glared at everybody, would not speak, and
was evidently in an abominable temper. I
could not make it out. I could only suppose
that he was annoyed because I had gone out
with Lady Diana. To me it seemed such a
trifle that my chief feeling was pity towards
Charlie for caring about such a woman. I
acknowledged Lady Diana's marvellous fascinative
force .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but then I loved Lucy. To
love her was to love truth, purity, intelligence
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to love indeed the God who made her.
For you could not really know her without
seeing that she came straight from God's
hand. Such creatures as my beautiful Lucy

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

are not developed from gorillas or ascidians.</p>

<p>Colonel Darell, who was seventy that year,
left the mess early; a Lieutenant-Colonel
Wynn took the chair. I always liked Wynn,
though he was a Welshman, and as intensely
Cambrian as Fluellen himself. When the
Colonel had gone we went in for Lafitte and
desultory talk. I listened, saying very little
indeed, for I was thinking over the divine
Sunday evening at Twickenham, and inwardly
grumbling that I was at Windsor that
night. The talk was dull; I had sunk into
a contemplative state, and my spirit was
away by the margin of Thames, when I was
aroused from my reverie by strident sound
of Charlie's voice. He was talking, with intentional
loudness, to his next neighbour.
He was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad Lady Diana has returned
safely. She has had a narrow escape,

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

I should think. Where did they pass the
night, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in Surrey," said Lieutenant
Rolfe. "All London is talking about it.
They say everybody will cut Lady Di."</p>

<p>"Rolfe," I said, sharply, across the table,
"what are you talking about? Lady Diana
Cre&ccedil;i drove me into Surrey on Saturday
night, and I came up to town the same
evening. I know very little of her ladyship,
to whom, by the way, I was introduced
by my friend Lovelace; but it appears to
me that her name ought not to be lightly
mentioned at our mess-table."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Sir Edward," said Wynn,
oracularly.</p>

<p>But Charlie, who was evidently in a fury
of jealousy, rose from his seat, and threw
the contents of his glass at me, saying,</p>

<p>"I'll name Diana where and when I

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

like. Choose your weapons, if you are not
a coward!"</p>

<p>I am not a coward. I was, physically,
in my early boyhood, but I got it well
thrashed out of me at school. Cowardice
is a vague term. In a sensitive frame it is
merely the dislike to physical pain. Moral
courage&mdash;by which I mean the will&mdash;is far
more useful than the mere physical courage
of the dull strong human animal. The man
who can say <i>I will</i> has found the fulcrum
desired by Archimedes.</p>

<p>A few drops of Charlie's claret fell on the
ruffles at my wrist. I was sorry, for his
sake as well as his darling sister's; but
things of this kind admit one only solution.
Fownes Luttrel was sitting next me; without
even glancing at Charlie, I said to
Fownes,</p>

<p>"Will you arrange this affair? Let it be

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

as early as possible to-morrow morning. I
never go to bed when I have to fight&mdash;it
chills one."</p>

<p>I think, from what I have since heard,
that poor Charlie was rather puzzled by my
cool way of receiving his insult. He was
not sober, dear old boy; had it been anywhere
but our mess I'd have reasoned with
him in friendly fashion, and got him to see
that he had made a fool of himself. But
this was obviously impossible at a regimental
mess. Insult is rightly inexcusable among
men whose profession is war. I knew I
must fight Charlie. It made me horribly
unhappy; whether I killed Charlie, or
Charlie killed me, what would Lucy say?
Ah! the grey morning on the heath .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the hostile forms vaguely looming through
the mist .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the chill sad feeling of
meeting an old friend as a new enemy. We

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

were to fight with pistols; how I wished it
could have been the rapier! But I was
known to be the best fencer in the Guards,
and so I could not use the weapon which
would have enabled me to disarm Charlie
without taking a drop of his blood. On the
other hand, I am an abominably bad shot,
so it seemed as if I were marked down for
destruction.</p>

<p>I resolved to fire in the air. Charlie
might kill me if he liked. But, just as the
handkerchief dropped, I felt a sharp touch
on my right arm, and my bullet, which was
to have been harmless, shot Charles Lovelace
right through the heart. He, firing
first, caused his own death. He never
spoke a word. Mine was a slight flesh-wound
in the forearm, which a little lint
set right.</p>

<p>I was stunned. It was the end of my

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

life, I saw. I could not marry Lucy now.
She would never speak again to the man
who had killed her brother. When I had
seen that Charlie was dead&mdash;my old friend,
dead by deed of mine&mdash;I walked blindly
away across the heath. Luttrel wanted me
to drive home quietly, but I exclaimed
hoarsely,</p>

<p>"Let me alone!&mdash;let me alone!"</p>

<p>I walked away from the scene of murder,
and tried to tire myself out by sheer exertion.
That night I had not slept. I felt
haggard and hideous. I had killed Charlie;
of course it could never be rightly explained
that I did not mean to kill him. But I
could never dream of marrying my darling
Lucy now; and how would Lucy feel to
me, her brother's murderer? O, how mad
I felt that day! The power of consecutive
thought seemed lost in me, and my brain

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

was a hell of hot fancies. I have no idea
how I passed the hours which followed the
duel. Some mere instinct brought me to
my own rooms late in the afternoon; I
went straight to my bedroom, locked myself
in, and threw myself on the bed without
undressing. Nature avenged herself; I
slept&mdash;a strange heavy dreamless sleep. I
did not awake for hours.</p>

<p>When I did awake, it was with an indescribable
feeling of numbness and dejection.
I was stupefied. For some time I could
not recall what had happened. When I
did, I almost relapsed into my previous
madness; but presently, through mental
fatigue, as I suppose, I fell into a state of
strange apathy. All that had happened
was like a farce. I laughed a strange sardonic
laugh at myself for caring that I had
killed Charlie and lost Lucy. A kind of

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

fiendish spirit took possession of me. I regarded
myself as the victim of an inevitable
fatality.</p>

<p>What ought I to have done? How often,
for years and years, did I turn that question
over and over? I ought to have refused
Lady Diana's invitation; I ought to have
forgiven Charlie's insult; I ought to have
fired in the air more carefully; I ought, all
these other mistakes having been made, to
have gone to see Lucy. Ah! there I was a
coward. I dared not. I knew I could not
venture to look into her tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>I don't know how long I was alone, in a
state of incredible languor. When I began
to think of time, it was very early in the
morning. I went to my window, and was
rewarded by seeing Pall Mall looking
dreary beyond measure beneath a heavy
"weeping" fog; the air was yellow. The

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

chill of the miserable morning, so exactly
suited to my wretched situation, smote me
to the marrow. I could think of nothing
but my own amazing ill-luck; I dared no
more think of Lucy than Adam dared think
of Eden after the cherubim had been set on
guard to warn him from its gates. I felt
rebellious. I did not see what I had done
to deserve such a series of misfortunes.
Again I threw myself on the bed, and tried
to forget my care in sleep. It could not be
done. I rang the bell at last, and when
the Villain came, told him to light a fire,
and bring some coffee.</p>

<p>To do the Villain justice, he was wonderfully
attentive on this occasion. I think he
had a kind of liking for me. Of course he
had heard of the duel, and knew well
enough what was the matter with me; but
he offered no remark. He lighted the fire,

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

prepared breakfast, brought up the <i>Courier</i>
and a pile of letters. When he had finished,
I dismissed him. Sitting in an easy-chair
by the fireside, I drank a cup of strong
coffee, with some brandy in it, and strove,
but strove vainly, to eat. Under the covers
were several tempting trifles, but I could
touch none of them.</p>

<p>I took up the morning paper; the very
first thing I saw was an account of the duel.
I turned to my letters. None looked inviting.
The first was from Norton &amp; Co.,
with a formidable account of my liabilities,
suggesting either prompt payment or additional
security. My next was from Ezra
Sykes, informing me that the year was a
very bad one, and that my rents were difficult
to collect, and that I was considerably
in advance of my income. I laughed cynically.
I felt quite an agreeable sensation

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

when I thought of being ruined. It served
me right. I had killed my friend, and
broken my mistress's heart&mdash;to have flung
away my property completed the circle of
my achievements. These letters gave me an
appetite. I ate some kidneys <i>aux fines
herbes</i>, though they were getting cold.</p>

<p>What to do? My energy returned. I
had a bath and dressed. I went first to my
agents, and instructed them to sell my commission
promptly. Then I went to Richmond,
hired a boat, and rowed to Twickenham,
past the lawn of Mrs. Lovelace's house&mdash;I
yearned to know something of Lucy. I
could only see that every blind in the house
was drawn. I went ashore, got writing
materials at an inn, and wrote a few lines to
my darling. They were incoherent, I know.
I tried not to throw any blame on Charlie,
though I knew he was more to blame than

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

I. If Lucy could have seen me as I wrote,
I think she might almost have been persuaded
to forgive me. I sent the note by
a messenger, ordering him to wait for an
answer. It came soon enough, written on
paper with a wide black edge.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lovelace, on behalf of herself and
her daughter, declines all farther intercourse
with Sir Edward Ellesmere."</p>

<p>They gave me some very fair port wine
at that Twickenham tavern. I finished the
bottle, with aid of an anchovy toast, and
then returned to London in a state of rebellious
disgust. The world was against me,
clearly. I had got into a downward current,
as much by other people's fault as my
own. Only a few days ago the happiest
man in England, with every hope of a pleasant
country home, with a lovely and loving
wife. I was now about the most miserable

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

of human beings. Why should this be,
through the fault of others? This was the
ceaseless question in my mind. It seemed
so infernally unfair.</p>

<p>I could not remain in London. I told
the Villain to pack up a few things in a
valise, and started that night by the mail
for Northamptonshire. I drove most of
the way, to the delight of the coachman,
who pocketed his guineas and rested his
arms. We reached the "George" at Northampton
earlier than usual.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">EZRA.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Oculus domini saginat equum."</p>

</div>

<p>NEXT morning I took horse and rode to
Ellesmere. Years had passed since
I had visited my old home. The terrible
blow which I had received made me reflect
sadly on the foolish way in which I had
neglected my estates and wasted my life.
The whole of my career unwound itself
slowly before my eyes, and I felt that it was
a series of lamentable blunders. I left behind
me a murdered friend and an estranged

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

mistress; I came to find an estate neglected
and impoverished. It was a dreary situation
for a young man who had started with
all the materials necessary for a distinguished
career.</p>

<p>Soon I saw the old gables and turrets of
Ellesmere in the distance. But before I
reached it I had to pass a very handsome
mansion, newly built, among pleasant gardens,
standing on a spot where I remembered
open common. Who could live
there, I wondered?&mdash;who had been cool
enough to enclose a part of my manor?
There was no one near of whom to inquire,
so I pushed on to Ellesmere.</p>

<p>The place was terribly altered since my
father's days. The beautiful gardens were
devoted to the growth of the commonest
vegetables; sheep grazed in the park where
there used to be herds of deer; the shutters

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

of all the windows were closed, and I could
not detect a wreath of smoke from any
chimney. Everything seemed so melancholy
that I felt almost inclined to ride
back to Northampton at once. The gates
were open, the lodge was unoccupied. I
rode to the front door, and rang a tremendous
peal on the bell. It brought a rough-looking
country lout from somewhere behind.
He said with surly civility,</p>

<p>"What's your will, master? Nobody
lives here now."</p>

<p>"Whose house is it?" I said sternly.</p>

<p>"You'd better ask Mr. Sykes. I suppose
he knows."</p>

<p>"Where is Sykes?"</p>

<p>"O, he lives down below in that new
house. He's a nice 'un, he is."</p>

<p>"Open the front door," I said. "This
house is mine. I am Sir Edward Ellesmere.

<!-- vol 1 page 136 -->

Open the door&mdash;then go and fetch
Sykes."</p>

<p>The fellow evidently did not understand
what it all meant; but my tone of command
made him obedient, and I soon heard the
unaccustomed bolts creaking in the locks. I
entered. There was a room on the right
my father had used to receive visitors on
business; I had the shutters opened, and
waited there for Sykes, striding up and
down impatiently amid the dust of years.</p>

<p>Ezra came. His hair was white&mdash;his
lank frame had grown portly; he was
dressed most respectably. He entered the
room with a doubtful look, as if not knowing
whether to be servile or impudent.</p>

<p>"You are quite a stranger, Sir Edward,"
he said. "I am sorry you did not give
me notice, that I might have had some
rooms prepared for you. Perhaps you will

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

condescend to stay at my little place."</p>

<p>"Your little place," I said, "appears to
be built on part of the common. I have no
recollection of giving leave that this should
be done."</p>

<p>"You left me general permission to manage
your affairs, Sir Edward, and of course
it was necessary I should be on the spot."</p>

<p>"Being on the spot," I replied, "you
might have kept this house and grounds in
order."</p>

<p>"What I did was for economy's sake. Sir
Edward. You know you required very
large sums of money. There seemed no
need to keep up a staff of servants."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! you might have kept servants
enough to prevent the place from being
ruined. I call this disgraceful! Am I to
be without a dinner or a bed in my own
house? You had better get some people

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

in, and prepare rooms for me at once.
After that, I will talk about business."</p>

<p>"You received my letter, Sir Edward?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes&mdash;I received your letter, I will
talk about that as soon as you can produce
your accounts in a fit state for examination.
Meanwhile, see if you can get some part of
the house made habitable."</p>

<p>My abrupt and irritated manner frightened
Ezra, who shuffled off to obey orders.
I was in a lovely temper&mdash;everything was
going wrong. Well, I would fight to the
end, and see if I could not discomfit some
of my enemies. It was bad enough to kill
my friend in a duel, and to lose my ladylove,
but when, in addition, I found my house
shut up and no apparent chance of dinner,
things became intolerable.</p>

<p>However, the worthy scoundrel Sykes
exerted himself. He sent up his own servants,

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

and emptied his own larder; he had
not had the audacity to invade the wine-cellar,
so I succeeded in getting a good
bottle of claret, to wash down a sirloin of
the juiciest, grown, of course, by an ox of my
own.</p>

<p>Before the post went out I wrote a letter
to my London agents, telling them to send
down at once, without regard to expense,
an accountant from the city, with ample
experience in landed property. I also
wrote to Norton for a statement of account.</p>

<p>For the next day or two I was alone. I
told Sykes that business must, for the present,
be deferred. I could see he was evidently
in suspense, and at a nonplus. He
had never expected to see me so resolute.
For my part, there was a melancholy in my
father's old house which seemed to calm my
maddened brain; I could see him and my

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

mother again, as they sat in the library or
wandered upon the terrace. One night,
when I had been in bed some hours, I
awoke suddenly believing that I heard the
organ in the hall&mdash;and the music was a
plaintive melody my mother loved. I sprang
from bed and descended the stairs, the
music dwelling in my ear all the while; I
half-fancied I should see my mother in her
long-remembered seat, her white hands
playing with the keys, my father bending
over her. Ah no, the hall was still; the
organ shut, the silence saddening. No footfall
or rustle of silk proclaimed the flight of
the spectral organist. It was all a dream&mdash;a
dream that had rested on brain and dwelt
in the ear after the passing of sleep. And
yet&mdash;was it a dream wholly? Might it not
be a visionary revealing of my mother's satisfaction
in what I was now doing?</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

<p>My agents sent down an accountant, and
Norton sent down his account. The accountant
was a Scotchman of sixty, named
Fraser, who had evidently lived upon
figures all his life. He came just in time for
dinner; over our wine I told him what I
had done (or rather, left undone), and what
I proposed to do.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," he said, with a
kind of deliberate drawl that seemed to indicate
profound reflection. "You will probably
find matters not half so bad as these
people are interested in proving; but it
generally ends, when accounts have ran so
long, in some sort of compromise. Of
course you have kept no account of the
suras advanced by Norton or supplied by
Sykes?"</p>

<p>He put this with an amusing air of pity,
as if the idea of a man in my position keeping

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

accounts was really too absurd. Why,
you might as well expect your dog to read
Homer. In reply to my negative he said:</p>

<p>"There will be my main difficulty. But I
shall conquer it, if I can make them think
you <i>did</i> keep accounts."</p>

<p>Fraser rewarded himself for this astute
idea by another glass of port. Then he
went on:</p>

<p>"I have had many experiences with men
of this kind, Sir Edward. It is like a game
of whist; the great point is, to discover your
opponent's cards. Now, in the present instance,
you and I are partners against Norton
and Sykes."</p>

<p>"I'm no better than a dummy," I said, "if
as good."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said Fraser, "you once
held all the trumps, but played them very
badly; you still hold the ace, being the

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

actual possessor of a great estate, however
much deteriorated and entangled. I shall
extricate you from labyrinthine imbroglios,
and we shall win the odd trick at least."</p>

<p>Fraser was fond of long words, which he
paired rather oddly, and of metaphors which
he sometimes mixed. But he was an accountant
of the first order, born with an
intuitive faculty for unravelling accidental
or intentional muddles; while his long experience
had made him familiar with the
greedy moneylender and the dishonest
steward, and he knew, by an inevitable instinct,
where to put his finger on the weak
points in their transactions.</p>

<p>I gave him <i>carte blanche</i>, and left him to
encounter the two scoundrels&mdash;one my
schoolfellow and the other my guardian&mdash;on
his plan. Only one point I was determined
about&mdash;to investigate to the utmost the circumstances

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

of Sykes's building on my manor
without leave, and to bring him to an account.
As for me, I sent to London for
the Villain, and for my horses and groom;
and spent my days in solitary rides about
the country, dining with Fraser at about
eight. I relapsed into a kind of apathy,
pending the settlement of my affairs. I did
not even open my letters. I felt stunned
and weary; my time was divided between
the saddle and sleep. Strange to say, I
could sleep dreamlessly; my brain, I think,
was so shocked that its imaginative power
had suffered paralysis. When I rode out,
the brisk motion and fresh air seemed to
give me a kind of languid pleasure; when I
went to bed, it was with a feeling that I
should be glad to sleep always. I should
have welcomed that impossibility of the
scientist, annihilation. I read no journals

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

at that time, though the war was at its
fiercest.</p>

<p>Ezra Sykes and Algernon Norton were
disgusted when they found they had Fraser
to meet; he was known as a redoubtable
antagonist. I forget how many months he
was at Ellesmere; but at length he came to
me with a statement of what he could effect.
He had immensely reduced Norton's claim,
and had made Sykes a debtor to the estate;
but still my extravagances had been such
that he saw no way of clearing the property
except by my letting the place, and allowing
the rents to accumulate for gradual payment
of arrears.</p>

<p>"I should not live here in any case," I
said. "It would drive me mad."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Fraser, "an unobjectionable
tenant is easily found. Indeed, I
think I can find one immediately."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

<p>"What about Sykes's house?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He has taken counsel's opinion, and
finds he is in the wrong. He offers ten
thousand pounds for the land on which he
has built."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds, that he stole from
me, in return for land that he also stole!
No; turn him out at once. I will not have
the reptile within sight."</p>

<p>Fraser remonstrated, but I was resolved.
Within a week Sykes left his new mansion,
I think he was glad to get away from
within my reach, but a grocer's widow,
whom he had married for her money, and
her two daughters (by the grocer), execrated
me as an abominable tyrant, and called
poor Ezra a mean-spirited wretch for giving
in without an action at law. Mrs. Sykes
and the two Miss Figgeses had been quite
the chief people of the neighbourhood for

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

some years; they went away in a great
rage.</p>

<p>The next thing I did excited Eraser's remonstrance
still more. I pulled down
Sykes's house, removed his conservatories,
destroyed his gardens (leaving only trees
and shrubs), and restored the place to its
previous condition of common land. I
would have no trace of the pestilent rascal
in the vicinage. The materials did well to
build a row of cottages for labourers, which
happened to be much wanted. Thus, thank
God, I was relieved from Ezra Sykes, who
has never crossed my path since.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">LORD LESBURY.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" 'Tis better to have loved and lost,
Than never to have loved at all."</p>

</div>

<p>FRASER, as he supposed, was able to
obtain a tenant immediately for the
house, and park, and the home-farm. Curiously,
it was a client of his own, a good deal
in my position&mdash;the young Earl of Lesbury.
Lord Lesbury's father had been so extravagant
that on his death it became necessary
to let Lesbury Hall for a term of years, and
the young Earl found himself with a very
small income indeed. But within a twelvemonth

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

a rich bachelor uncle, high in the Indian
service, died, leaving him a very
large fortune; and, as he was anxious to
have a place in the country, while waiting
to re-enter his own demesne, he was glad to
make an offer for Ellesmere. He, as well
as I, had been Fraser's client, and the arrangement
between us was quickly made.</p>

<p>He came down to look at the place, and
we seemed to become friends at once.
There was a candour about him, a luminous
temperament, that reminded me of Lucy.
It was almost painful to be in his company
on this account, but it was a pleasurable
pain. I soon found out the meaning of this.
On the first night of his visit we were sitting
together after dinner, Fraser having left us,
no doubt designedly, when Lesbury said,</p>

<p>"Sir Edward, there is one thing I must
tell you&mdash;pardon me if it gives you pain&mdash;I

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

am a first cousin of Charles Lovelace."</p>

<p>"And of Lucy," I thought. "No wonder
I felt a strange trouble."</p>

<p>But I said nothing.</p>

<p>"I know what happened between you
and Charlie," he said, "and I can assure you
that I, in common with every man to whom
I have spoken on the subject, think that
the fault was entirely his."</p>

<p>"Not entirely," I said. "Chiefly, I admit;
but if I had possessed more strength of
mind, I might have prevented the duel, and
saved myself from life-long sorrow."</p>

<p>"I never could understand Charlie's laying
a trap for you as he did. It was so different
from his usual character."</p>

<p>"He was maddened by jealousy. He had
led too fast a life, and it did not suit him."</p>

<p>"Not faster than yours," said Lord Lesbury,
"if I may say so."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

<p>"Not so fast. But I am an easy Epicurean,
to whom self-indulgence is only too
natural. Charlie was a Stoic, created for
hard work and brave deeds, who took to
dissipation because he was weary of enforced
inaction. He was born to command, and
might have been a Wellesley if he had had
the chance."</p>

<p>"And you, Sir Edward?"</p>

<p>"O, I might have been a Cotton, perhaps."</p>

<p>There was silence for a time; then Lesbury
said,</p>

<p>"I have something more to tell you, if
you will kindly have patience to listen.
Years ago Lucy and I were boy and girl
sweet-hearts. When she grew into her
beautiful youth I loved her, but I saw she
regarded me simply as a brother. Of course
I said no word. When you were visiting at
Twickenham I was away in Warwickshire,

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

trying to arrange my father's affairs; but I
saw her once, during a hasty visit to London,
and she spoke of you in a way that showed
me you loved each other. It gave me a
pang, but I was sincerely glad she would be
happy. I have not seen her since till about
a month ago."</p>

<p>"Is she changed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She is more serious, perhaps, though
she always had her fits of melancholy. It
is a serene sadness; she reminds me of a
Madonna of Raphael's that I saw in Italy.
Her eyes have a remote look; she is more
beautiful than ever. She spoke of you."</p>

<p>"She did?"</p>

<p>"Yes. 'I must never see Edward again
in this world,' she said. 'If it were right, I
could not bear it. Ah! and, besides, I
should be afraid of myself and of him. We
could not meet coldly. You may tell him

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

what I say, Harry, if you should ever see
him.' I think I remember her very words."</p>

<p>I could not speak to thank him. My face
was hidden by my hands. He rose and
paced the room, respecting my grief.</p>

<p>After a long pause, I said,</p>

<p>"Lesbury, I thank you. Do not speak
to me again of Lucy."</p>

<p>"I will not," he said; "but I wish to say
something more <i>now</i>. May I?"</p>

<p>"Go on," I replied.</p>

<p>"How should you feel if Lucy were to
marry?"</p>

<p>"I hope she will. It will only add to
my own grief to think of her as living a
lonely life. If she should marry a good
man, and have children, all this will be only
a bitter-sweet memory of the past, to be recalled
in melancholy hours. O, I wish
her to marry!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

<p>"You speak generously and nobly. I
love her still. I have never in my life said
a word to her of love. But, as we are first
cousins, and know each other so well, I have
thought in time she might learn to love me
a little. It would be a love like twilight at
first."</p>

<p>"A morning twilight, that becomes full
noon in time," I replied. "You have my
heartiest wishes. I know that with you
Lucy will be happy&mdash;happier, perhaps, than
she might have been with me."</p>

<p>No more was said. I dreamt that night
of Lucy at Ellesmere, not my wife but
another's, and wealth of roses blooming to
greet their queen, and nightingales singing
passionately through the sweet Summer
nights. But in that dream I was not miserable&mdash;for
there had risen in my heart a
mighty desire for Lucy's happiness.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

<p>Very soon after this I left Ellesmere to
Lesbury, and went forth on a pilgrimage. I
discharged all my servants, the Villain among
the rest; he was profoundly sorry to go,
and I don't wonder at it. He must have
made a very fine income out of my follies;
the rumour reached me that he himself set
up as a country gentleman, and eventually
got into the society of people whom he had
previously seen when standing behind my
chair. Why not? Has not a footman become
a Secretary of State?</p>

<p>Fraser advised me not to draw more than
two thousand a year from the property, and
I had inwardly determined to live on much
less than that, in order to free my paternal
estate. My mothers large inheritance, I
should have mentioned earlier, passed to
the Lyle family on her death. But Ellesmere
was a noble property, if only I could

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

clear off the encumbrances; and this I
resolved to do, having a special object therein.</p>

<p>Lesbury wished to correspond with me.
I told him that he might write to me when
he found his happiness secured, but that I
wished, for a time at least, to isolate myself
from all my friends and acquaintances. I
wanted to try a new kind of life. Too long
had I been travelling in one groove&mdash;the
straight and swift descent to Avernus; I
pined to take a wholly different track.
Lesbury tried hard to persuade me to keep
up a correspondence with him, but could
not shake my resolution. It was at last
agreed that he should write to me, under
care of Fraser, when he had asked Lucy
and received her answer.</p>

<p>He seemed more grieved than I when I
rode away one April morning entirely alone.

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

I had kept from my stud a famous brown
hunter, Mazeppa, steady and strong, and a
splendid fencer; on him, with a valise strapped
to the saddle, containing the merest
necessaries, I rode away from Ellesmere. I
took with me a good stock of money, not
wishing to communicate with Fraser for
some time. Lesbury went with me to the
gate, where I grasped his hand with a
hearty wish for his success, and cantered
away across the wide common, no longer
made hideous by Ezra Sykes's mansion.</p>

<p>What was I leaving behind? My father's
house; my true love; my wasted life. No
pleasant thought for a man past his freshness
of youth&mdash;past the days of illusion. A
time comes when you comprehend the
world, and find that much of what you
deemed its beauty was the mere creation of
your own ebrious brain. Somebody says

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

that youth is a perpetual fever; my youth
was. I have since learnt that you can only
be happy when you see the world as it is,
not as you fancied it in your early delirium
of delight. But to see the world as it is!
who can do it? Some regard it through
the golden glass of perpetual sunshine;
some through the blue glass of perpetual
frost. What we want is the white light of
truth.</p>

<p>I rode for weeks through the lovely
weather of April; and, though I did not
forget my great grief, I felt some consolation
in the thought that I had now acted
rightly. Great strength and solace nature
gave me, in the song of heaven-seeking skylark,
and cyclic flight of ever-returning swallow&mdash;with
wealth of wild flower, and music
of brook, and delicious breath of wind.
And from humanity I also found relief;

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

country folk, peasant lasses, had their gay
greeting for the traveller, gave information
in a kindly way; landlords of wayside inns
apologised for their humble accommodation,
yet made me far more comfortable than
when I stopped at an hotel at The Bath or
at Weymouth. I seldom met a churl,
though those were rougher times than these;
and I often thought, what a pity it is the
different classes of the English do not
know each other more intimately. I am of
the same opinion to this day, after an experience
without parallel. The poor have
something to learn from the rich; the rich
have quite as much (perhaps more) to learn
from the poor.</p>

<p>On the last day of April, being a Sunday,
late in the evening, I rode into a small midland
village, and pulled up at what seemed
to be the principal inn. It was a large

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

rambling two-storied place, with a rustic
porch in front, where smokers were sitting.
The landlord came forward in his shirt-sleeves,
and a boy ran to hold Mazeppa, and
I dismounted. On asking whether I could
have supper and a bed, mine host began to
apologise at once, but I cut him short by
saying that I was used to rough living, and
could eat anything and sleep anywhere. Upon
this he showed me into the bar, where a
not unwelcome fire was burning, and went
to consult the "missus." The favourable
result of this conclave being quickly announced,
I went off to look after Mazeppa.</p>

<p>The landlady wanted to do me honour
by putting me in a private room, but I was
too old a campaigner.</p>

<p>"No," I said, decidedly, "this is far too
comfortable a corner for me to leave. And
I dare say you will have company presently,

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

and then I shall hear some clever
talk."</p>

<p>"Ah, that you will, sir," said the landlord.
"I don't think e'er a man in England
knows so much about old Bonypart as
our Will Smiter, the blacksmith; and I believe,
if he were to be Minister, we should
soon have that fellow in a cage to show as
a wild beast."</p>

<p>"Nonsense about Will Smiter," said the
landlady; "Mr. Drawl, the parish clerk,
knows far more than he does. As how
shouldn't he, seeing that he has to help the
Rector on with his surplice every Sunday
morning?&mdash;if so be he comes, that is."</p>

<p>The difference of opinion between landlord
and landlady as to the village oracles
did not prevent my having a capital supper.
I got a joint of roast lamb, and some first-class
home-brewed ale. I thought I might

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

as well finish the entertainment with some
wine, "for the good of the house," and was
surprised by getting an excellent bottle of
port&mdash;though port was much better at the
beginning of the century than it has ever
been since.</p>

<p>The village wiseacres arrived while I was
engaged with my wine. It was easy to
recognise Mr. Drawl by his seedy, semi-clerical
look, and Mr. Smiter by the stalwart
hammer-hardened muscles that seemed
to resent compression within unaccustomed
sleeves. Other rural luminaries were present,
but I cannot recollect them all.</p>

<p>The village debate this evening did not
deal with Bonaparte and the Ministry. Two
other topics of closer interest made this
bucolic senate neglect foreign affairs. The
next day was May Day; there was a maypole,
a wake, and the like; and a tremendous

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

schism had occurred between the villagers
as to who should be Queen of the
May. I should hardly have recollected the
names of the two candidates but for their
country origin; one was Ruth Greenland,
the other Mary Appleyard. No choice had
been made; the wise seniors anticipated,
apparently with pleasure, the appearance of
two rival Queens, and a free fight between
the lads of the village of the opposing
Greenland and Appleyard factions. It was
Montagu and Capulet in miniature.</p>

<p>On the other topic they spoke with bated
breath. "Mad Will Scudamore was back."
With some difficulty, their dialect being
peculiar, I found that this worthy was a
native of the village; that he had been
the plague of the place till he 'listed for a
soldier; that he came back, having deserted,
and turned highwayman, so that none of

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

the roads were safe; that he had been away,
nobody knew where, for three or four
years; that now he was back again, and
had robbed several people quite lately. He
rode an iron-grey horse, but nobody could
guess where he lived, unless it was at
Eynsham Caves&mdash;which appeared to be some
old lead mines.</p>

<p>I went to bed more amused with the
evening's talk than I have often been with
the conversation at the mess-table. I slept
soundly, and was awakened by sounds of
rustical music. Looking from my window,
I beheld the tall maypole on the village
green, and two opponent bands of youngsters
were each bringing forward a rival
queen. One, whom I afterwards learnt to
be the Greenland, was a tall slender girl,
who looked as if she were dying of consumption.
The Appleyard was short and

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

round and plump, and looked as if nothing
could hurt her, unless she overate herself.
Whig and Tory never had better causes of
quarrel. Between <i>tall and slender</i> and <i>short
and plump</i> there is a definite issue.</p>

<p>I strolled down before breakfast to see
the fun. The rival bands of lads used
strong language to each other, but seemed
loth to fight. There ought to be a teacher
of boxing in every village. These louts had
pluck enough to throw stones at each other,
but dared nothing further. I was going
away to look for breakfast, when I heard
Mr. Drawl, the parish clerk, speak with
tones of authority. He threatened the
ringleaders of the riot with the stocks and
the whipping-post, and advised them, as
they could not agree which was the prettiest
girl, to have two queens, and pass their
holiday in a peaceable neighbourly way.

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

The sagacious words of this ecclesiastical
Nestor allayed the storm; the two queens
became allies, and I, wishing to cement the
peace, handed Mr. Drawl a guinea for each
of them, which seemed to give the girls and
their lovers amazing delight. I had thrown
away such myriads of guineas, just to pass
the time, that I walked back to the inn astonished
at the pleasure two guineas could give.</p>

<p>A wholesome country breakfast was prepared
for me in a parlour looking on a
quaint, old-fashioned garden. After that
meal, I walked out on the common, where
the fun grew fast and furious. If they had
begun to dance already, where would their
legs be by bed-time? As I thus reflected,
I was joined by the parish clerk and the
blacksmith, both of whom looked so anxious
that I thought perhaps the French had
landed.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

<p>"Are you going to travel to-day, sir?"
said Drawl.</p>

<p>"Towards evening, I think."</p>

<p>"I ask," continued the parish clerk,
"because that highwayman, Mad Will
Scudamore, was on the green to-day, and
saw you give me money for the girls."</p>

<p>"On the green!" I said. "Why the devil
didn't you seize him?"</p>

<p>"We're all afraid of him," said Smiter.
"He's bewitched&mdash;you can't hurt him."</p>

<p>I knew full well it was useless to reason
with this sort of superstition. It has an
intelligible basis. The most reckless men,
whether soldiers or robbers, are always the
most fortunate; if two men meet, of whom
one values his life and the other does not,
the latter has the advantage; so I merely
said,</p>

<p>"Well, I am not afraid of the fellow. I

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

thought of riding over to a little town called
Redborough; I see it is only a dozen miles
by the map, so I need not start till late."</p>

<p>Parish clerk and blacksmith both shook
their heads sadly, and evidently deemed me
lost. Even the landlord and landlady piteously
remonstrated, when, after a ramble of
many hours, and a final glance at the May-day
sports (the two queens were somewhat
dishevelled and rumpled), I came in for
some dinner before starting. I merely
laughed at their scruples.</p>

<p>The sun had set, and there was a bright
crescent moon as I rode away toward Redborough.
I had pistols in my holsters, but
my main reliance was on a heavily-loaded
riding-whip, and on my knowledge of
Mazeppa's cleverness. I had travelled about
four miles, when my quick eye caught something
that moved in a lane that joined the

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

high road just in front of me; I patted my
horse's shoulder, and rode rather faster.
Out of the dim light came down upon me a
man on an iron-grey horse, pistol in hand,
shouting some blasphemous threat.</p>

<p>Quick as light I rode Mazeppa at him;
with one cut of the whip I broke his pistol
wrist; with a second, right on the temple, I
struck him from his horse. The animal,
too good for his master, stood like a rock.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards beyond I thought I
saw the lights of a house. Without waiting
to ascertain the scoundrel's condition, I rode
forwards, and found a picturesque roadside
inn, with a group of splendid trees in front
of it.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">Arborum directi in quincuncem ordines.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cicero</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>I REINED up Mazeppa at the inn door;
under the porch stood the landlord, a
wiry fellow, shirt-sleeved, erect. He gave
me a soldierly salute with the left hand, and
I perceived his right arm was gone.</p>

<p>"Cavalry officer," he said. "Knew the
trot. What can I do for your honour?"</p>

<p>"I have just knocked over a fellow who
tried to rob me," I said. "It was close by
here. Can you send some people to see
what has happened to him?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

<p>"Why, it must be Will Scudamore, sir,"
said the landlord. Then he blew a shrill
whistle, and several men came running up
from the stables. "Go down the road with
lanterns; this gentleman has knocked down
a robber. Won't you come in, sir? I'll
take the greatest care of your horse, and
my wife will take the greatest care of you."</p>

<p>I dismounted. There seemed no reason
why I should trouble myself about this discomfited
highwayman. I had no particular
desire to push on to Redborough, and might
just as well see what this old soldier could
supply in the way of provender and sleeping
arrangement. The place looked promising.
I was shown into a parlour comfortably
furnished; and the landlady, a brown dark-haired
lass of five-and-twenty, did all she
could to make me comfortable.</p>

<p>Having discovered that a supper and a

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

bed were procurable, I visited the stables to
see that Mazeppa was well-housed and well-fed.
When I returned, they had just brought
in the highwayman and his horse. The
fellow was stunned, but, I am happy to say,
not dead. Having, by inadvertence, killed a
friend, I had no wish also to kill an enemy.
The landlord had him shut up in a room
that night, with a man on guard; and in the
morning sent to Redborough to the magistrate.
The famous iron-grey horse was impounded.</p>

<p>I, being the hero of the hour, got a capital
supper, and the best wine the house afforded.
Things were good, for it was a coaching
house, and about a dozen coaches changed
horses there during the day. This brought
in a nice little bit of business, as the landlord
alleged. When I had dined, I asked
him to make a bowl of punch, and to join

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

me in drinking it, and we grew quite confidential.
His buxom wife did not disdain a
glass. I soon found out that both the landlord
and his wife were originals.</p>

<p>"My name, your honour," he said, "is
Timothy Short&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be so proud of such a
name as that," interrupted the landlady.
"I never thought I should live to be Mrs.
Short."</p>

<p>"It was very wrong of you, my dear, to
condescend. My wife's a superior woman,
sir, and I'm afraid I don't exactly do her the
justice which her sublime character requires.
I've always thought myself rather an unlucky
man, sir; if you're born short, and
christened Timothy, what are you to expect
but to lose your right arm in battle and marry
a scolding wife?"</p>

<p>"Isn't he a wretch?" said buxom Mrs.

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

Short, good-humouredly. "As if I ever
scolded him!"</p>

<p>I saw clearly enough that Timothy and
his wife enjoyed these little squabbles, and
played them off as a kind of comedy for the
amusement of spectators. They were a
capital pair. Each had a special humour,
and each had opportunity to gratify it.
While Tim was absorbing all the casual
news brought by the stage-coaches that
breakfasted and dined and supped at his
house, Mrs. Tim made herself agreeable to
anybody who stayed at the house, whether
for an hour or a night.</p>

<p>Timothy Short was by no means short in
his narratives; he made me acquainted that
evening with the greater part of his history.
I learnt where he had left his right arm, and
how his wife Barbara came to fall in love
with him. He liked to talk about himself,

<!-- vol 1 page 175 -->

but too often got cut short by his wife, who
had doubtless heard all his stories so often
that she could have told them better than
he. I ascertained from him that the inn
was the "Romayne Arms," and that the
little village around was called Five Tree
Hill. The property belonged to General
Romayne, who was on foreign service.
Timothy, who had been born on the estate,
and had served for years in the General's
own regiment, was put into the inn when his
wounds compelled him to leave the army.</p>

<p>"He's a good gentleman, the General,"
said Tim, "though uncommon fierce. When
he came to see me in the hospital he said,
'Short, my man. you shan't starve. There's
a new landlord wanted at the little inn at
Five Tree Hill, so I've written to my steward
that you're to be the man. Get well, go
home, and marry a woman that can manage

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

a house, then you'll make your fortune.' "</p>

<p>"You seem quite in the way to it, Timothy,"
I said. "You've got the right sort of
wife, anybody can see. But why is this
place called Five Tree Hill?"</p>

<p>"There's a story about that, sir. The
arms of the Romaynes are five trees. I
don't know in what century it was, your
honour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Any century will do, Timothy," said I,
thinking of my uncle Toby.</p>

<p>"Well, there were five brothers of the
Romaynes, and the eldest stayed at home and
married, and the other four went out to see
the world, and make their fortunes. Before
they went they planted five trees in a clump,
each putting in one. Years passed away,
and nothing was heard of any of them, for
I believe it was before writing letters was
invented; but one morning, when the Squire

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

came downstairs, he saw that one of the
trees was withered, and said, 'My brother is
dead.' And the other trees died in the
same way, the eldest brother's being last of
all. So his son took five trees for his arms,
and wherever the Romaynes settle, they
always plant five trees in a cluster. There
are five opposite my door."</p>

<p>There were, as I discovered next morning,
when lovely May sunshine brought me
down early. As I walked out of the front
door I heard the ringing horn of a mail-coach,
and ostlers came out with four fresh
horses. Up came the mail; the steaming
horses were unharnessed, and rubbed their
heads together as they walked into the well-known
yard, expectant of corn; outside
passengers tumbled off hastily to snatch a
glass of "something short," Timothy being a
renowned maker of "lamb's wool." Mrs.

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

Short herself appeared at the coach door,
to see if any ladies inside required refreshment.</p>

<p>"Harry," said Timothy to the guard,
"you needn't carry that old blunderbuss of
yours any more; we've got Will Scudamore
safe."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" said coachman and
guard at once.</p>

<p>"I do, though. There's the gentleman
that did it. I want you to tell the Redborough
constable, that he may come after
him."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a blessing that scamp's taken.
I'll send the constable."</p>

<p>At this moment off started the fresh team,
and the place was quiet. I examined the situation.
The high-road ran along the ridge of
a long hill; on the right hand, as you looked
towards Redborough, there was a wide

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

common, gradually sloping downwards; on
the left a lane that was half grass descended
much more steeply to a valley in which
water was visible. The Romayne Arms
occupied a corner of this lane, the front
being in the lane itself, while the stable-yard
faced the road. At the opposite corner, on
a space of turf, was a quincunx of stately
trees; the centre one a very tall Lombardy
poplar, the other an oak, a beech, a walnut,
and a Spanish chestnut, all evidently of
great age. The sign that swung in front of
the Romayne Arms was a real work of art;
this very group of trees was painted on it,
and by no mere dauber, clearly.</p>

<p>The whole aspect of this place pleased
me; the bold sweep of common one side,
across which there was a glimpse of Redborough
town; the steep suggestive lane on
the other, with immense trees and crystal

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

water. Half way down the lane on the right
hand there seemed to be a cottage buried in
trees; and in front of its gate there was
another quincunx, of exactly the same
character. A third, as I discovered later,
had been planted at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>I determined to stay at the Romayne
Arms a day or two, and explore the neighbourhood.
So I went in, and found Mr.
Short busy preparing my breakfast. The
kitchen was visible from the wide passage;
there was the buxom landlady toasting herself
before a brisk fire, while she delicately
toasted my rashers of bacon. The meal
was excellent&mdash;the freshest cream and eggs
and water-cresses; and when I praised the
tea, Timothy said,</p>

<p>"Well, your honour, it goes against my
conscience, having served the King, but I
must confess to you that tea hasn't paid duty.

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

My wife's brother is in that way of business,
and. I can't quarrel with him for bringing me
a chest of good stuff when he comes this way.
I hate quarrels between relations."</p>

<p>"And your wife likes good tea, Timothy.
Small blame to her. You needn't let your
conscience trouble you; if the duty had been
paid the King wouldn't have got it&mdash;it would
only have been wasted by his ministers."</p>

<p>This casuistry gave Tim great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Who painted your sign, Timothy?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, I wish I knew. He was a gentleman
about fifty perhaps, that came here
by the down mail one dreadful snowy night.
He'd been going further, but the cold was
too much for him travelling outside, and he
had his luggage got out, and stayed here.
He was very feeble at first, and said he had
been suffering from a sharp illness; but he

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

got better in a week, and looked quite
young again. One day he asked for his
bill; I gave it him, and he paid it, and turned
over the gold he had left ('twasn't much)
in the palm of his hand with a queer look.
'Landlord,' says he, 'that's all the money
I've got, and I ought to be somewhere else
making more; and I don't want to go.
That old sign of yours is in a seedy state;
how long will you keep me here if I paint
you a first-rate one?'</p>

<p>" 'A month, sir,' says I, without thinking;
and didn't my missus blow me up when I
told her! But when she saw him put out
his easel and sit all day patiently drawing
the trees, and bringing out branch after branch,
she said, 'He may stay a year if he likes.'
The trees were all bare, for the late snows
made it a dull spring; but he painted them
as they were&mdash;and then, when they came

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

quickly into leaf with the hot sun, he painted
them with their leaves on. So one side
of the sign is Winter like, and the other's
Summer."</p>

<p>"I did not notice that, Timothy," I said.
"I must look at it."</p>

<p>They were two masterly pictures, that improved
as you examined them. The character
of each tree had been caught perfectly,
both with and without its leaves; you
could see from the bare bough that it must
have such foliage as the companion picture
showed.</p>

<p>"Well, your honour," continued the
garrulous landlord, "he didn't say a word
about going away; but when the sign was
finished and hung up, he set to work and did
a picture of the house. And then he
painted the missus, and then he painted me&mdash;they're
wonderfully like."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

<p>"Where are they, Timothy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Upstairs, sir."</p>

<p>He led me to a large old-fashioned
panelled room on the first floor, evidently
kept for great occasions&mdash;full of nick-nacks,
and with two bow-windows, through which
the light streamed cheerfully. On the walls
were the picture of the inn, and life-size
portraits of Timothy and his wife, done with
real power. There was not only masterly
execution&mdash;there was also that divination of
character which belongs to the great
portrait-painters only. The great painter is
the best of all historians. What a revelation
is there in a portrait of Titian or Vandyke!
I have just seen Mr. Millais castigated by an
art-critic for adhering to portraiture; but if
he has the supreme art he is right. Unluckily
the people who can afford to pay
the fee of a great portrait-painter are

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

seldom the people whose portraits posterity
will care to see.</p>

<p>"These are admirable, Timothy," I said.
"How long did your friend stay with you?"</p>

<p>"About eight months, your honour. One
Autumn morning, when the London coach
from Redborough pulled up, he walked out
as cool as possible, without any luggage, and
got up outside. 'I'm going to London for
a day or two, Timothy,' he said. 'Take
care of my things; and, by-the-way, just
deliver this letter.' He threw down the
letter as the coach was off, and I picked it
up without looking at it, and told my wife.
'Let's look at the letter,' says she; and
fancy, sir, it was addressed <i>Mr. Timothy
Short!</i> So I opened it, and there was a
Bank of England note for a hundred pounds,
and nothing else in the world. That was
two years ago, and I've heard nothing more

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

of the gentleman; his luggage is here still,
and I've kept the bank-note, for his paintings
are worth more than that, I'll swear,
and he never cost me half the money."</p>

<p>Tim insisted on showing me the note; it
was charmingly crisp and new, and bore the
magic signature of Abraham Newland.</p>

<p>"Put it in a frame, Tim," I said, "and
hang it up in your bar&mdash;it will astonish
your visitors. Only mind Mrs. Short takes
it up to bed along with you and the silver."</p>

<p>There was a long morning before me. I
left the landlord, just full of business through
a stage-coach arrival, and strolled down the
lane. It was very steep, and by no means
straight. Half way down, as I have said,
there was another quincunx formed of trees
of the same kind; it stood opposite a green
gate, through which I could just catch a
glimpse of a pleasant lawn and a quaint cottage.

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

A thick yew hedge, six feet high,
ran down the hill, securing the privacy of
the garden. Idly speculating as to who
might live there, I passed on to the bottom
of the lane.</p>

<p>This was an idyl. A grass ride, equally
tempting in both directions; parallel with it
a clear stream, in which the trout were visible;
on the other side, accessible by stepping-stones,
an ancient chapel, which I later
found was dedicated to Apollonia, that
saint whose teeth cured the toothache, and
who was kindly so prolific of teeth that
many tons of them were found when the
monasteries were dissolved. Saintly kindness
could go no farther; St. Apollonia could not
have wanted so many teeth for her personal
use, though rumpsteaks were probably
tougher in her time than in ours.</p>

<p>The chapel was small and old; the surrounding

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

soil had grown up round it; the
windows were mere arrow-slits; moss and
lichen of centuries encrusted it, and there
was maiden-hair fern growing on its topmost
stones. The door was a round archway.
There was not a house in sight, nor a human
being; it was a solitude that to me seemed
delight. Since I had killed my friend, and lost
my love, I pined for nothing but to be alone,
unknown. I could bear the company of absolute
strangers, people not of my own class;
but I preferred absolute solitude. I did
not brood over my great trouble; I accepted
my fate, and hoped that Lesbury and my
beautiful Lucy might be happy together.
But it seemed strange that I, who had lived
the gay life of a Londoner, should find no
solace now except in the quietude of woods
and fields and streams. Song of bird
and colour of flower seemed sent to cheer

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

me. When alone in the Spring sunshine, I
fell into a visionary state, and seemed to assimilate
the natural calm around me.</p>

<p>I was not, however, on this occasion destined
to remain long in my trance&mdash;being
aroused by the arrival of Timothy Short,
who cried out to me across the stream&mdash;</p>

<p>"Begs pardon, your honour, but the
Redborough magistrates wants you to go over
about Scudamore."</p>

<p>I crossed the brook, and found that the
magistrates wanted my deposition before
they sent the highwayman for trial, and had
adjourned their session till four in the afternoon,
that I might be present. So I walked
up the steep lane in the landlord's company,
and, as I passed the gate of the cottage half
way up, asked him who lived there.</p>

<p>"Nobody, your honour. It's to let&mdash;to a
gentleman."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to the General," said Tim.
"His great uncle, Doctor Romayne, lived there
till about four years ago, when he died&mdash;over
a hundred, they say. He didn't look
above seventy at the last, and he wouldn't
have died if he hadn't fallen downstairs. He
was a wonderful nice old gentleman, and
knew everything."</p>

<p>"And the place is to let?" I said, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Well, your honour, it's this way&mdash;I've
got the letting of it. There's the old gardener
and his wife living there, and keeping
it in order. The General, after the old
Doctor's funeral&mdash;he's buried close where
your honour was sitting&mdash;the General says
to me: "Short, if any gentleman that
looks the right sort would like to live in the
cottage, you may let it him, sticks and all,

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

for twenty pounds a year. But don't let any
damned tradesman have it; burn it down
first."</p>

<p>After a bit of bread and cheese, and a
pint of Timothy's home-brewed ale, I mounted
Mazeppa, and rode towards Redborough.
As I rode, I could not help thinking of the
quaint cottage which, "sticks and all," was
to be let for twenty pounds a year. Why
shouldn't I take it, and be forgotten? I determined,
at any rate, to see it the very next
day.</p>

<p>It was slightly down hill all the way to
Redborough. The town&mdash;a flourishing one&mdash;apparently
got its name from the red
sandstone of which it is almost entirely
built. The effect is pleasant. There are
three fine old churches and a ruined castle
in this material. The streets are mostly
narrow, but very clean, from the abundance

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

of water, which flows down from the moor,
and turns the gutters into brooklets. The
County Hall, which I had to visit, stands in
a market-place; where also are some other
public buildings. In the centre of this
market-place is the statue of a queen,
crowned, under a rich stone canopy; but
the antiquaries cannot decide what queen it
represents.</p>

<p>My business with the magistrates was
brief enough. The court was crowded&mdash;all
the neighbourhood had come to see the
famous highwayman, and the man who had
terminated his career, and I was received
with applause. The robber had engaged a
pettifogger to defend him, and this fellow
cross-examined me amusingly. I had given
my name as Edward Ellesmere, leaving the
baronetcy unmentioned, and had said that
I had no fixed address, but was travelling

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

for my amusement. The scene that followed
was laughable.</p>

<p><i>Pettifogger</i>.&mdash;You say you have no address?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;None.</p>

<p><i>Pettifogger</i>.&mdash;Do you consider that respectable?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Pettifogger</i>.&mdash;Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h! Respectable!
Are you sure you are not a highwayman
yourself?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Quite.</p>

<p><i>Pettifogger</i>.&mdash;Can you produce testimonials
to your respectability?</p>

<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I do not consider it necessary to
produce such testimonials before knocking
down a robber&mdash;or an insolent lawyer.</p>

<p>Pettifogger gobbled like a turkey-cock;
the old fogies on the bench interposed, and
complimented me on my courage, and committed

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

the prisoner; and I went across the
market-place to what seemed the principal
hotel, to make arrangements about corresponding
with Fraser. Whether I took the
cottage or not, I meant to stay at Five Tree
Hill for some time.</p>

<p>The Royal Hotel was crowded with
people who had come to hear the case. I
got complimented on all hands for my pluck.
Loudest in his praise was Sir Boanerges
Brooks, chairman of the bench of magistrates,
whose every alternate word was an
oath; and who damned himself to the
twentieth power (as a mathematician might
say), with the wish that he had had the
chance of doing the same thing. As I
looked at Sir Boanerges's blear eyes and
puffy abdomen, I doubted whether he would
have done it.</p>

<p>Escaping as well as I could from the

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

bucolic crowd, I got at the landlord, and
arranged with him to receive any letters
addressed, "<i>Mr. Ellesmere, Royal Hotel, Redborough</i>."
Then I mounted Mazeppa, and
rode home to dinner&mdash;received with quite
an ovation by Timothy and Barbara.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Hic in reducta valle Caniculae

</div>

<p>TIMOTHY SHORT took me next day to
see old Doctor Romayne's cottage,
which he had called Beau Sejour. It was
a rambling place, two stories high; the
garden and lawn were delightful, shut in by
thick hedges of yew and Portugal laurel,
haunted by innumerable starlings, blackbirds,
thrushes, grosbeaks; a perennial
spring rose in front of the house, and, after
filling a wide water-cress bed, ran in a tiny

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

rivulet down to the brook below; the sunny
May air was alive with pigeons, there being
a large dove-cot, with pyramidal roof, at
the back of the cottage. It was the quaintest
isolated corner. The entrance was at
the side, into a little hall; beyond were a
couple of sitting-rooms opening on each
other, and a door from each of those rooms
opened into a bedroom behind.</p>

<p>"What is upstairs?" I asked Timothy.</p>

<p>"Come and see, your honour," he said.</p>

<p>I ascended, and found one large room,
rather low, extending over the whole of the
house&mdash;the servants' rooms, as well as those
I have described. It was lined on all sides
with bookcases and bookshelves, and the
floor was covered with boxes full of books.
The room was very light, having windows
on all sides, and in one of those windows
stood an old black oak writing-table, with

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

an uncomfortable straight-backed chair to
match. A sheet of paper and an old quill
lay in front of the chair. I glanced at the
paper, wondering what Doctor Romayne
may last have written in that antique chair.
There was one word&mdash;"Yes"&mdash;in very
faded ink. Perhaps it was only the first
syllable of yesterday.</p>

<p>I said <i>yes</i> in my own mind at once, for I
thought I would sit in that straight-backed
chair, and look at the lovely landscape
below&mdash;all garden and lawn to the stream
and Saint Apollonia's chapel&mdash;and investigate
this quaint old forgotten library. Doctor
Romayne's <i>yes</i> seemed prophetic and
effective, as, indeed, it was.</p>

<p>That evening I was much amused by a
little fight between Timothy and his wife
on the merits of their respective almanacs.
Almanacs were dear then, thanks to the

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

shilling stamp; one and tenpence seems a
heavy price; but who could do without his
almanac? Mrs. Short takes the work of
"Francis Moore, physician," and reads to
her husband with delight the following prediction
for May:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This month is ushered in with an opposition
of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Mars</i>, and soon after
there is an opposition of the <i>Sun</i> and
<i>Saturn;</i> these show the motions of armies,
and the usual misfortunes and miseries attending
the same; the loss of honour, or
death of a great prince, also of a military
commander of the first degree."</p>

<p>"There!" says buxom Mrs. Barbara,
"what do you say to <i>that</i>, Timothy Short?"</p>

<p>Now Timothy's favourite almanac was
<i>Old Poor Robin</i>, and he at once began to
read in return:&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Now jolly lads, who, left at home,
    Are safe from war and strife,
Let each in haste fulfil his doom,
    And take himself a wife.
For soldiers if one half are gone,
    What must the maidens do?
Why, I myself, good faith, for one,
    Am willing to take two."</p>

</div>

<p>"Yes, that's your <i>poor</i> Sir Robin!" says
Mrs. Short. "I wonder you aren't ashamed
of such nonsensical trash in these dreadful
times!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! my dear," says the old soldier,
"Sir Robin's right enough. He says just
after:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'We all of us will mend our lives,
And fight our foes, and love our wives,
Keep dear Old England hale and hearty,
And thrash this rascal Buonaparte.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"Ah! now that's better," quoth Mrs.
Short, "But still, you know, Moore does
tell what's going to happen."</p>

<p>"Ay, but it doesn't happen," retorted
Timothy.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

<p>"Now, how can you say so? Didn't he
prophesy, only two years ago, the death of
the poor Emperor of Turkey? I remember
the very words. 'If he can save his
life, let him: I give him fair warning.'
And isn't the Emperor murdered, just as
Doctor Moore said he would be?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't deny the Grand Turk,
that's a fact," says Timothy. "It was a
good guess."</p>

<p>"Guess!" cried the indignant Mrs. Short.
"Why, last December our cow died, and
you know Moore said there would be lots
of casual accidents."</p>

<p>"Your honour's a scholar," said the provoking
Timothy, turning to me. "Is <i>casual
accidents</i> Latin for a cow's dying of old
age?"</p>

<p>The quarrels between Timothy and his
wife were mere comedy quarrels, and soon

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

came to an end; and on this occasion the
old soldier got the best of it by declaring
that Poor Robin, some five years ago, had
made Mrs. Short propose to marry him,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Girls, this is Leap Year. Come, be bolder;
Next time you will be four years older.
Don't throw away another Summer,
Marry the very earliest comer."</p>

</div>

<p>When Timothy found that I had a fancy
for living at Beau Sejour he was perfectly
delighted. There were no stables at the
cottage, but Timothy could make Mazeppa
comfortable, and I saw full well he would
be pleased to do it. Then came the question
of somebody to cook my dinner, and so
forth. The gardener and his wife were in
charge, and I designed to keep them on, but
the gardener's wife was very deaf, and had
imperfect ideas of cookery.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't your sister Emma like to come,

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

my dear?" says Timothy to his spouse.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Short, "she would do
very well, I think. Only you know I must
tell the gentleman all about her."</p>

<p>"True," quoth Timothy, with profound
gravity. "Never hide anything."</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said Mrs. Short, with a
tear in her eye, "my sister has had a misfortune.
She was very great friends with a
young man, who pretended to be very religious,
and went to the same chapel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
she, poor dear! believed in him, and he took
advantage of her, the mean wretch! and then
ran away. She had a poor little child, that
died; she's living at home with mother at
Redborough, and moping; but I think she'd
make a good servant if you don't object,
sir."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> sister's a good girl, I'll swear, Mrs.
Short," I said. "She will do capitally.

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

Don't tell her that I know anything of her
misfortune. It would only make her uncomfortable,
without cause."</p>

<p>"She is sure to ask, sir," said Mrs. Short.</p>

<p>"Say <i>no</i>," I answered. "There is not the
slightest need for anyone's knowing anything
about it. If she comes here without any
explanation, she may get on very comfortably."</p>

<p>Thus I was provided with a servant, and
a capital servant she became; but before I
took possession of Beau Sejour we had an
adventure at the Romayne Arms. My highwayman
had been kept in Redborough gaol
all this time; one morning the guard of the
up mail told Timothy that all the town was
excited because he had escaped.</p>

<p>"You'll hear something about him up
here," said the guard. "He's desperate revengeful
and cunning."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

<p>His conversation Timothy repeated to me.
Although not alarmed, I was prepared for
anything. From all I had heard of this man
Scudamore he was not a mere ordinary thief;
a disordered brain had driven him to the
highway, just us it drives others to the Stock
Exchange, others into Parliament.</p>

<p>The Romayne Arms was generally half
awake all night, thanks to the night coaches.
Sunday night was the exception; and one
Sunday night I was awakened by feeling a
rough hand upon my shoulder. It was
pitch dark. My greatest annoyance is to be
disturbed in my sleep, and my greatest
virtue is promptitude. I struck savagely at
the place where the head of such a hand
ought to be, and was rewarded by finding
my fist do damage. My assailant fell to the
ground. I got out of bed and vigorously
rang the bell, disturbing the whole household.

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

The first arrival was a servant-maid,
who, determined to be decent, had in her
hurry put over her arms the garment designed
for her lower extremities. My man was
stunned; and the affair cost me, much to my
annoyance, another interview with the Redborough
magistrates. However, on this
second occasion rather more care was taken
of Will Scudamore.</p>

<p>I took possession of Beau Sejour. I found
the old gardener and his deaf wife very useful
servants; he, though slow, was sure, and
had that old experience which</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doth attain
To something like prophetic strain."</p>

</div>

<p>Though never rapid, having outlived rapidity,
he was never idle. Tom Radstock
couldn't be idle if he tried; he must be doing
something.</p>

<p>His wife kept the kitchen fire burning,

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

and was indefatigable in cleaning&mdash;hating a
speck of dirt as much as Nelson hated a
Frenchman. She and Emma got on well
together. So I got settled down, and I enjoyed
two things&mdash;the lovely quiet country,
and old Doctor Romayne's library. I studied
the country first. I wandered and pondered.
It was to me a new form of existence,
and I learnt many things in that isolation.
Down where the clear stream murmured
and rippled by the dusty old lichen-stained
walls of St. Apollonia's chapel I drank in
the beauty of nature, and thought over the
infatuate folly of my own life. "What
shadows we are," said the most eloquent of
men, "and what shadows we pursue!" I
resolved to pursue shadows no longer. I
determined to follow (a long way off) those
philosophers who cared only for intellectual
beauty. Rang in my ears those lovely lines:</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"How charming is divine philosophy!
Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,
But musical as is Apollo's lute."</p>

</div>

<p>And to philosophy I was recalled, when one
day through Fraser I received a letter from
Lesbury. Thus it ran:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Ellesmere</span>,</p>

<p>"Forgive me for being happier
than you. When the only girl that I could
ever love told me, with tears in her eyes,
that she would try to love me, I felt, amid
my supreme happiness, almost the misery of
a murderer. If I lost Lucy now it would
kill me; yet I sometimes think I could suffer
that loss if it were possible for her to be
yours.</p>

<p>"But I will not waste words, when words
cannot touch the depths of meaning. Lucy
vows she will not marry without a line from
you to say she may.</p>

<p class="right">"Your loving friend,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Lesbury</span>."</p>

<br/>

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

<p>It took me some hours to decide how to
answer that letter. I thought I had obtained
the power of sacrifice; but then came the
vision of Lucy Lovelace in another man's
arms&mdash;ay, even Lesbury's&mdash;and, my God! I
felt as if I must kill that man. I wandered
up and down my garden: I went down to
St. Apollonia's chapel, and listened to the
river. I walked myself dead tired, and
positively frightened poor little Emma by
my face's pallor, when I came back, after a
long struggle with myself, anxious to catch
the post. Then, with tremulous hand, I
wrote a blotted line, not to Lesbury.</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Lucy</span>,</p>

<p>"Marry Lesbury. Try to be
happy. I will try to be content.</p>

<p class="right">"Your lover once, your friend for ever,</p>

<p class="right">"E. E."</p>

<br/>

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

<p>When I wrote that scrawl, I little thought
I should ever see it again. Yet I did again
see it, carefully kept in an ivory casket, and
yellow with age.</p>

<p>I sent off my letter, and shut myself in
Dr. Romayne's library. I wanted something
rough to break my mind upon, as a great
poet hath said. I took a quarto MS. volume,
and sat in the black oak chair, and gazed at
the book some time without realizing what
it was about. When I did, I found there
was a weird wild geometry in it. There
was the family quincunx, pentagrammatic:</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="fig01.png" />
</p>

<p>There was a stellated pentagon thus arranged:</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="fig02.png" />
</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

<p>This puzzled me greatly for some time,
till I saw that <i>Pax</i> and <i>Lux</i> were herein
indicated, a cross being the common terminal
of both. And this, indeed, I found more
clearly shown by some verse, in a most crabbed
MS. that followed the pentagram:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Lux est amor, Pax est Lui,
Christe, animarum Dux!
Mihi da amoris flammam,
Mihi daque pacis mammam.
Amo ubi amet Dux:
Sequor ubi signet Crux."</p>

</div>

<p>There was a good deal more Latin rhyme
in the volume, some whereof struck me as
not exactly what Catullus would have tolerated,
and as being particularly loose in its
subjunctive moods. There was mathematics;
there was astrology; there was chirognomy;
there was alchemy. Here is a recipe for
making gold, which I have never tried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take a female toad, seven years old;

<!-- vol 1 page 212 -->

put it in a new linen cloth; carry it seven
miles (walking and fasting) between midnight
and one o'clock, on the eve of Saint
Bridget; as the clock strikes one drop it on
a mass of red-hot iron, saying the Paternoster
backwards; then sneeze seven times, and
wait till the iron becomes <i>aurum purum</i>."</p>

<p>It struck me that the man who could
walk seven miles in an hour, and sneeze
seven times at will, had better go in for some
mode of making gold less dubious than
alchemy.</p>

<p>When I came to investigate old Dr.
Romayne's MS, I found, amid much whimsical
and capricious stuff, some very suggestive
essays. He was, I discerned, a Pythagorean
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or perhaps I should say a developed
disciple of the Samian sage. He did not
believe that Homer had been a camel in
Bactria, at the time of the siege of Troy.

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

He laughed to scorn, in a fine vein of irony,
the theories of one Dr. Erasmus Darwin,
who, as I am informed, declared the origin
of man from geometrical figures, in a treatise
entitled, <i>The Loves of the Triangles</i>. If
the father of the human race was an isosceles
triangle, he might almost as well have been
an ape. As a great poet remarks:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Blockheads there are who gladly would disgrace
By hideous origin the human race,
Make equal with poor products of the sod
The only creature who is like to God.
Who, if he wisely uses life's brief hour,
With the Creator shares creative power."</p>

</div>

<p>And this, indeed, is so. For in the many
isolated years I passed among Dr. Romayne's
books in Beau Sejour, I came to know
people like Hamlet and Falstaff, like Rosalind
and Desdemona (poor little girl, why
did she marry a bragging black man?), like
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, that are

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

more thoroughly flesh and blood than a good
many people who walk about and coolly
pretend to be alive.</p>

<p>But I digress. Let me come to Doctor
Romayne's Pythagorean theories. "The
man," he wrote, "who has not lived before,
is an impertinent fellow to pretend he is
alive now. His death can be as logically
and irrefragably proved as that of Partridge,
the almanac maker. If he is not at
once buried, it is simply because ground
grows dear. The soul is immortal; he who
deems otherwise, can have no soul, but is an
automaton produced to resemble a man,
and designed entirely for a warning to real
human creatures. Such eidola, or phantoms,
move among us, 'tis certain, and write theologic
and philosophic essays, and set up to
be emperors and statesmen. This dangerous
age is fertile of such creatures, as there

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

is a blight of baneful insects when an evil
east-wind blows.</p>

<p>"To determine between men with souls
and their simulacra," continued the venerable
doctor, "is the most important and
most difficult problem of philosophy. After
long and severe study of men and books, I
have formed certain opinions, which I hope
to make clear to myself as I pursue this
inquiry, in an essay toward truth which
probably will be read by no eyes save
mine.</p>

<p>"An inspired poet has written:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Their idols are silver and gold&mdash;
    The work of men's hands;
Mouths have they, yet speak not;
    Eyes have they, yet see not;
Ears have they, yet hear not;
    Noses also, yet smell not;
Hands have they, yet handle not;
    Feet have they, yet walk not;
Neither uttereth their throat speech.
<i>They that make them are like unto them</i>.'</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

<p>"Herein," continues the doctor, "lies the
essence of my philosophy. Those who make
idols are like idols. As from <i>εἴδωλον</i>, by
gradual trituration of language, came <i>idol</i>,
so <i>idol</i> is shortened to <i>doll</i>; and as monosyllables
are convenient, I propose in my
future nomenclature to divide the human
race into <i>men</i> and <i>dolls</i>. The man believes
in God; the doll believes in dolls.</p>

<p>"I have met in my time with persons apparently
virile, who declined to admit the
immortality of the soul. Examine such a
person, you will find he is a doll, and a doll
cannot have an immortal soul, or indeed any
sort of soul. Examine such a doll farther,
and you will find he has eyes that cannot
see the glory of God, ears than cannot hear
His words, hands and feet that cannot do
His work and walk in His ways, lips that
utter what seems speech, yet is not. To

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

imagine him the bodily presentment of an
immortal soul would be absurd. He expects
annihilation&mdash;he is already annihilated.</p>

<p>"My essay towards establishing this first
principle of ontology must needs desult (as
the Romans said of the rider of more steeds
than one in the Amphitheatre), since I am
only gathering by degrees its proofs and
examples from history, and experience, and
observation. Indeed, this is only an essay;
should I live to form it into a treatise (which
seems unlikely, being now ninety-five), I
hope to base my theory on the true inductive
method of the great Verulam.</p>

<p>"I may say here that doubtless my distinction
between the <i>man</i> and the <i>doll</i> applies to
both sexes; but women are so unwilling and
unable to answer philosophical questions as
to their mental and physical structure in a

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

direct manner, that I have small hope of extending
the proofs of my theory on that
side. This shy incapacity proceeds from a
delicate instinct, like that of the mimosa,
which shrinks from the touch&mdash;like that of
the timorous bird which flies away into the
woods at a step. Without troubling that
instinct, I may yet prove my thesis&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Πρὸ τῶν ἐπαισχῶν χρὴ λόγων δάκνειν στομα</i></p>

<p>"But if I have met, or should meet, an
apparent woman, who possesses either no
grace or modesty, no love of kin, no fortitude
in suffering, no belief in God, I shall
maintain that she is no woman, but a pale
simulacrum, an eidolon, a doll."</p>

<p>"Queer old philosopher!" thought I, as I
shut the big book, resolving to re-open it
soon.</p>

</div>

<p>DR. ROMAYNE'S library had an immense
influence over me. I listened
with loving awe to the voice of this venerable
thinker, coming from beyond the river
of fate. As I read essay after essay that

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

had come from his unresting brain, I grew
gradually to think I knew him. I used,
after a long perusal of his work, to picture
to myself a tall and venerable sage, stooping,
white-bearded, with keen penetrative
eye, with attenuate long fingers, eagle-claws,
till I might have painted his portrait easily.
Then I would go down to the little burial-ground
by Saint Apollonia's chapel, and sit
on the grass mound that covered his dust,
and watch the sunshine on the pleasant
trout stream, and read again and again the
simple inscription on his tombstone:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">HENRY ROMAYNE, M.D.<br/>

<span class="smcap">Born</span>,<br/>

MDCCIV.<br/>

<span class="smcap">Died</span>,<br/>

MDCCCV.</p>

</div>

<p>I had fixed his imaginary portrait on my
mind so much that I was always conjuring
it up before me; and when I took long

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

rides over the moorlands on Mazeppa, I used
to fancy the doctor by my side on a comfortable
cob. Indeed, we carried on imaginary
colloquies to an immense extent, and I
clung to his personeity as a fixed idea.</p>

<p>Odd how well I remember coming back
from one of those rides, after a glorious
gallop over gorse and heather, that made the
moor a double stream of colour, and dismounting
at the "Romayne Arms," and
walking in to get a tankard of Timothy
Short's home-brewed. Some demon prompted
me to say,</p>

<p>"Timothy, you knew old Doctor Romayne,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Lord, yes, your honour. He larruped
me once when I was a boy for throwing
stones at a cat."</p>

<p>"And served you right, you vagabond!"
promptly said buxom Barbara.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

<p>"What sort of a man was he, Timothy?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"What, to look at? Never saw his like,
your honour. He was short and plump,
with white fat hands, and quite a round
rosy face, and brown hair (the little he had)
to the very last, and such a laughing look
with him, and O so quick! I wish I could
see him now, sir, trotting up the lane, in his
black breeches and gaiters. It was a treat
to hear him talk. He took a deal of exercise,
and used to walk, mostly; he kept an
old pony here, your honour, but when I
asked him if he wouldn't ride, he'd say,
' 'Tis a shame, Tim, to have out poor old
Jack, when I've got good legs of my own.'
And he'd drink a glass of beer as hearty as
your honour, and walk away laughing and
singing and rubbing his hands, and oftwhiles
talking to himself in all manner of
languages. O he was a man!"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

<p>"Ah! that he was!" said Barbara. "He
used to kiss me and call me a little slut, and
tell me if ever I was a widow he'd be my
second."</p>

<p>Alas for ideals! Could this lively centenarian
be my departed Pythagorean Doctor?
Surely some mocking fiend had got
into the library and transformed him
utterly.</p>

<p>When I got home and had dined, I pondered
much. A glass of old port helps one
to ponder. What had happened to me had
forced my intellect, making me prematurely
old. I wished I had asked no questions
about Doctor Romayne's personal appearance;
having done so, I philosophized over
the affair in the method taught me by my
unseen tutor, till I began to believe that,
after all, I might be right, and Timothy
Short and Barbara wrong.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

<p>"There are those who have eyes, yet see
not," I reflected. "How easily might such
people, who can see no splendour in the
sky, transform the Doctor into the odd little
man they describe! I won't believe it. I
have seen him."</p>

<p>At midnight, in the Doctor's sanctum, I
pursued the theme in my own mind, trying
to decide whether the soul forms the body,
or whether soul and body have only incidental
connection. What we call chance
led me to a desultory essay in another part
of the great folio I was studying.</p>

<p>"Mr. Abraham Johnson," it said, "in his
ironic letter to the Royal Society, published
this year of grace, 1750, is intentionally
wrong in his main thesis, but unconsciously
right in an argument on which he bases it.
There can be no doubt that the body is a
mere tenement, into which the soul passes

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

from another similar tenement. If the soul
enters on its new domicile wearied by a previous
period of toil and distress, its energy
cannot control the development of that
domicile, and hereditary tendencies often
get the better of it. Thus may we account
for the frequent appearance of a great man
in a frail or ugly body; for</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">'The tenth transmitter of a foolish face'</p>

</div>

<p>being a statesman or soldier, or even poet.
Who would expect genius from Epicurus, if
his profile has correctly reached us?</p>

<p>"Now, if the soul comes fresh from a
happy career, these hereditary influences
have no force. The strong spirit moulds
the frame. Poetry lightens the eye; eloquence
curves the mouth; skill shapes the
flexile fingers; courage and vigour mould
and poise the frame. You have Apollo,
not as he shepherded for Admetus, but as

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

he sends afar the unerring arrow, or brings
marvellous music from the lyre.</p>

<p>"Hence, those who would possess greater
happiness and beauty hereafter, should aim
at happiness and beauty here.</p>

<p>"<i>Corollary</i>. There is no limit to the height
of happiness and beauty to which man may
ascend."</p>

<p>"Egad!" thought I, "this may explain
the mystery. The Doctor's philosophical
soul, tired by a previous residence not quite
satisfactory, doubtless fell into the mould of
a family of lively humourists!"</p>

<p>I must not weary my readers with too
many extracts from the essays of this
modern Pythagorean; nor, indeed, must I
be too minute in describing the life which I
lived at Beau Sejour. It was a very quiet
one all through&mdash;being about thirty years;
during which time the mighty tide of affairs

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

which agitated Europe seemed to flow
through another world, so completely had I
isolated myself. Lover once, I heard with
slight interest of the birth of Lucy's son and
Lesbury's heir. Soldier once, I felt no
pulse of triumph when "the meanest man
of men" fell before our loyal Captain at
Waterloo. Landowner once, I was unmoved
when Fraser reported that I was as
rich as I had ever been. Henry Romayne's
mysticism had enthralled me; to follow his
sinuous track of thought was "riches fineless."
I believed his theory more absolutely
every day, and looked forward for years
with eagerness to the proof which death
would give of it. Wherever I was,
Romayne's mystical spirit haunted me. I
not only read all he wrote and all the
books in his library, but wrote a whole
library of essays myself&mdash;all on the one

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

great theme. By the time there came an
end to my studies, I was master of many
languages and of abstruse science&mdash;all self-taught,
as some would say; all really taught
me by Henry Romayne, <i>archididasculus</i>.</p>

<p>Still, though the outer world interested
me slightly, the microcosm of Five Tree Hill
had its events. One morning, some years
after I had lived at Beau Sejour, returning
home from an early meditation by Saint
Apollonia's Chapel, I was told that a gentleman
was waiting to see me. Entering the
room, I perceived an old man who, in all
but the stoop, was the very picture my volatile
imagination had drawn of Doctor
Romayne. He met me with extended
hand, saying,</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Ellesmere. I am
General Romayne."</p>

<p>I said I was glad to see him, and said so

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

truthfully; for I had always felt grateful to
the unknown landlord whose "twenty
pounds, sticks and all," had made me a
Pythagorean.</p>

<p>"We've beaten that damned rascal over
the water," he said, his eyes flashing fiercely,
"so I've time to look after my estate, which
is going to the devil! I'd be glad to see
you any time, but they tell me you're quite a
recluse."</p>

<p>I told the General I was a solitary
student, and that the old Doctor's books had
made me so, and that I hoped never to leave
home again.</p>

<p>"Damned odd fellow you are, Ellesmere!
Guessed who you were before I saw you.
'Gad! you're uncommon like your father!
We've ridden side by side in two or three
hot things, my boy! He cut a fellow's right
arm off at the shoulder just as he was poking

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

a lance into me once. I've got the mark
now," he said, putting his left hand to his
side. "An inch farther, and where the
devil should I have been? Fancy your
burying yourself here, and reading old
Harry Romayne's magical stuff! Why don't
you come into the world again, and marry?
You're ten years younger than your father
when he married Amoret Lyle&mdash;the prettiest
woman I ever saw. Your estate's getting
free, I hear&mdash;you dipped it pretty well, you
young dog! Come now, give up old
Harry's magic; I'll soon find you a wife.
I'm the best judge of virgins and horses in
His Majesty's Army. Better marry a
widow than be roasted for a wizard."</p>

<p>The General's humour was so magnetic
that I think he might almost have wiled me
away from the Doctor, and turned a Pythagorean
philosopher once more into a man of

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

the world, but for a sudden thought of Lucy.
I had a vision of the Thames in the twilight,
of a myriad roses and a thousand nightingales,
of a maiden whose soul shone through
her&mdash;whose voice stirred the Daulian minstrel
to vain rivalry&mdash;whose touch made
roses bloom. No; there could not be
another Lucy; her love was worth a life.
For the minutest division of a breath methought
she was beside me again. In that
infinitesimal atom of time's diamond-dust I
swore allegiance to Lucy and my invisible
tutor.</p>

<p>"Well," quoth the General, laughing at
my refusal, "you must come over to Romayne
Court for a week, whatever you do.
It shan't be said your father's son was my
neighbour and tenant, and wouldn't visit
me.</p>

<p>I tried to decline, but I could not resist

<!-- vol 1 page 232 -->

the obstinate kindness of my father's friend.
The General had driven a curricle over
from Romayne Court, which is just beyond
Redborough; he insisted on my having my
traps sent up to Timothy's at once.</p>

<p>"I won't lose sight of you, Ned," he said;
"I shall call you Ned&mdash;you're a boy,
though you are a philosopher&mdash;and your
father called me Tom; so come at once; you
needn't bring anything dandified&mdash;you'll
meet no women."</p>

<p>We walked up to Timothy's, when,
evidently for the first time, the General
noticed the nobly painted sign. He stood
transfixed, with his lean right hand pointed
at it; then he cried:</p>

<p>"Tim Short, you villain, who painted
that sign?"</p>

<p>"Gentleman without a name. General,"
says Tim, saluting.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

<p>"What did you pay for it?"</p>

<p>"Board and lodging, General."</p>

<p>"Take it down!&mdash;no, leave it there! By
the Eternal, that's worth a thousand
guineas!"</p>

<p>The General's voice had a fine thunderous
quality&mdash;each of his short sentences grew
louder than the last, so that you wondered
what would be the final roar. It was a
voice trained amid the din of artillery on
the battle-field.</p>

<p>"The gentleman as did it left a hundred-pound
note behind him," says Timothy.
"It's framed in the bar."</p>

<p>Tim had taken my advice, and it had
brought him many customers. The yokel
thought it worth while to drink much beer
or grog, sitting with eyes and mouth wide
open, to stare at what he had never dreamt
of&mdash;a bit of paper worth a hundred pounds!</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

<p>When the General learnt what other
work the unknown artist had done, he went
upstairs to see it. He examined long, and
in unusual silence, the portraits and the
painting of the inn.</p>

<p>"Tim Short," he said, at last, "I want
the picture of the inn, and I'll give you another
hundred-pound note for it. Take it
down, and tell my servant to be devilish
careful of it, or I'll blow his brains out.
No, by the Eternal, I don't think I <i>could</i> do
that!"</p>

<p>Applying the Doctor's test to the General,
I concluded that he was a <i>man</i>, not a <i>doll</i>.</p>

<p>The painting, carefully wrapped up, was
handed to the footman, and the curricle
came round.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd drive, Sir Edward," said
the General. "These horses are young and
fresh, and nearly pulled my arms off till we

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

got to the hill. After dinner, we'll talk
about that mysterious artist."</p>

<p>The young horses took us pretty fast to
Romayne Court, a handsome old place
above Redborough, built of the same sanguine
stone, with beautiful garden terraces.
No guests had the General except his
steward, who was busily engaged with him
in going through arrears of business. When
that gentleman, who lived in Redborough,
had left us. General Romayne said:</p>

<p>"Now, Ned, another bottle of port; I'm
melancholy to-night. What think you of
those pictures?"</p>

<p>"They are wonderful," I said, "so far as I
am any judge. The painting of the trees on
that sign seems as good as anything I ever
saw."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> as good. Now, why the devil
should a great artist come and stay at Five

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

Tree Hill and paint all that, and give Tim
Short a hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>"Men of genius have caprices not to be
explained," I suggested.</p>

<p>There was rather a long pause, during
which the General gazed at the beeswing in
his glass of port. There was a curious look
in his eye, as if he were trying to hide something
that affected him.</p>

<p>"By the Eternal!" he burst out, "the
fellow is a genius, though I always thought
him a fool. Ned, that painter is my only
son, Lionel Romayne. We quarreled&mdash;he's
just as angry as I am&mdash;because I wanted
him to fight, and he <i>would</i> paint. Lord, I
might have remembered that <i>my</i> father wanted
me to preach, and I <i>would</i> fight. I might
have been a Bishop by this time&mdash;a captain
of the Church Militant."</p>

<p>"And what is your son doing now,
General?" I asked.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

<p>"Why, they tell me that, under an assumed
name (for he swore in his wrath he would
never be called Romayne) he is the most
famous painter of the day. I must not tell
you the name; you will guess it."</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "I have been too long
out of the world. But his coming to Five
Tree Hill seems to show that he had kindly
feeling to you, and would gladly be reconciled."</p>

<p>"Ned, you're a damned humbug!" said
the fiery General. "If he likes to come
here and call himself Lionel Romayne, instead
of the false name he goes by, I'll forgive
him. The estate is entailed; when I die
he'll have to claim it, or it must go to the
next heir, if there is a next heir; and if not,
to the Crown. We're an obstinate family,
Ned, and Lionel's just as obstinate as I. He
won't come to me, and I'll be hanged if I go
to him. So you need not try to persuade

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

me, my boy. Nobody ever changed <i>my</i>
opinion, by the Eternal!"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Laugh away, my boy," he said. "We
Romaynes pride ourselves on being the most
obstinate family in England. Obstinacy
makes men successful. My great-grandfather
made millions as a scrivener, obstinately
refusing to part with money at a low price.
His son was Secretary of State; his grandson
was Archbishop of York; his great-grandson
is a General; his great-great-grandson is the
first painter in the world. All through the
family, father hated son and son hated father
obstinately; but it has been a point of honour
that, however they quarreled, the property
should go straight. Come, if you have
had wine enough, let us look at the portraits
of these worthies. They're in the large
dining-room."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

<p>We went. The scrivener in black velvet,
but for his stoop, might have been painted
for the General. He had the keen eye and
attenuate electric hand which I had imagined
for Doctor Romayne. The Secretary of
State was exactly what Timothy Short had
described the Doctor to me&mdash;humorous,
vigorous, brown-haired, a laugh lurking on
his lips, a hand white and plump as a woman's,
with a diamond on one finger .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
yet a born diplomatist; one could see. The
Archbishop was of an alien type; dark,
almost sinister, stern as to the mouth, with
an air of inflexible will in the knotted fingers
of the hand that grasped his crosier. I
wondered if the errant painter was of the
archiepiscopal type. I resolved to ask
Timothy Short. There passed rapidly
through my mind Doctor Romayne's theory
about hereditary influence, but to the
General I said,</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

<p>"They are splendid portraits, and all fine
faces. The first of the series is very like
you.</p>

<p>"Yes, confound it! Fancy being like a
scrivener, even if he <i>is</i> your great-grandfather!
And, by the Eternal, my father is
very like that scamp of a son of mine!"</p>

<p>I spent a pleasant week with the General,
chiefly riding over the estate with him and
his steward. At the end of that time, he
went to London, and I returned to Beau
Sejour. What happened when General
Romayne died, and his son, the painter, had
to prove his identity, need not be recorded
here, being written in contemporary memoirs.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">FORD COTTAGE.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">                <i>Τοῖσιν ἐμπείροις βροτῶν
μόνοις οἷόν τε συνταλαιπωρεῖν κακά</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE was a ford across the stream,
half a mile or so below Saint Apollonia's
chapel: white stepping-stones, where
many a country lass had wetted her feet,
and a shallow crossing, where waggoners
had given their horses a drink for centuries.
Stood thereby an old cottage in a coeval
garden and orchard, occupied till lately by
the widow of the late miller at Eynsham
Mill, who had succeeded somebody else's

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

widow. Indeed, Tim Short called it Widows'
Cottage, and invented stories about a score
of widows that had occupied it in succession&mdash;stories
that could hardly be very near the
truth, as they varied on every occasion.</p>

<p>One day Tim informed me, with great
delight, that Widows' Cottage was let to
another widow&mdash;"a real lady this time,
your honour. She's a Mrs. Lee, and she's
got a little dot of a girl with her, about a
year old; and she tells Barbara, who went
down to see what she could do for her,
that she has had much sorrow and trouble,
and wants to be quiet for the rest of her
life. I suppose she's not philosophical,"
says Tim, "and so found her husband a
nuisance."</p>

<p>I thought very little of this bit of news,
and certainly never guessed what that "little
dot of a girl" would become to me. Two

<!-- vol 1 page 243 -->

or three years passed in my favourite study
and solitude before I even saw Mrs. Lee.
When I did meet her, it was by accident, in
the God's-acre of Saint Apollonia's Chapel,
where the pretty bright-haired little girl
was picking flowers and ferns. We talked&mdash;about
the weather, of course. The
young widow had the face of a sorrowful
yet resigned Madonna. Somehow we gradually
became friends. I never knew her
story, which it was easy to see must have
been a very painful one, since it had cast a
settled melancholy over a character naturally
designed to be joyous. This woman,
at thirty so pensive, was as gay as a skylark,
I'll swear, at twenty. What had crushed
her, I never desired to know.</p>

<p>We gradually grew friendly, and being
beyond the region of gossip, and beyond
the folly of love-making, we could enjoy

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

such friendliness. Helen Lee was like a
too early twilight in Summer. Her lovely
life had been saddened by some remediless
grief, and there was nothing left her but
the golden-haired "dot of a girl," who soon
became my playfellow. The choicest of
essayists has said that you may lose yourself
in another man's mind as easily as in another
man's grounds. So long had I lost
myself in the mighty mind of my <i>archididasculus</i>,
Henry Romayne, that I was glad to
let myself out by a wicket gate, and talk
nature to a pensive lady, and nonsense to a
merry child.</p>

<p>We exchanged visits, regardless of scandal&mdash;which,
indeed, left us quite alone.
There was a diagonal meadow-path up-hill
from Ford Cottage to a side-gate of my
Beau Sejour garden, and on fine days it
became an institution that Mrs. Lee and

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

"Dot" should come up to lunch, or that I
should go down to tea. Very often it was
both. Dot, by the way, had been christened
Mavis&mdash;and a bird-like little fairy she
was.</p>

<p>Helen Lee and I did not fall in love,
though condition and juxtaposition might
have justified it. She thirty, I forty,
and her only incumbrance Dot with the
golden locks. I think we got so far as
platonic affection. But her great grief kept
her fancy-free, while I thought more of
Lucy the more I saw of another woman,
and kept the love of my lost darling as my
chief solace&mdash;the transcendental philosophy
of Doctor Romayne being the next.</p>

<p>My uneventful life at this time requires no
minute chronicle. As time went on, Mavis
Lee passed from a baby to a girl, and then
I took her for a pupil. I did not teach her

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

abstract metaphysics&mdash;I taught her English
poetry and literature; and when she had
drunk deeply of the sweetest spring that
ever flowed, I took her to the older fountains
of Greece and Italy. Some severer
studies were necessary, doubtless; even girls
must know a smattering of history, geography,
and the like; but we made tales of
our history, and maps of our geography.
Helen Lee often laughed at the odd way in
which tutor and pupil went to work, as we
three sat in the great book-room of Doctor
Romayne, whose windows always caught
the least stray sunshine; but Mavis picked
up plenty of pure bright knowledge in
this way, which made her after-life a myriad
times happier than it might have been. Her
mother taught her religion and music and
painting&mdash;the child was a born artist. And
on pleasant days, when Mavis was a dot of

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

a girl no longer, we used to haunt the
chapel of St. Apollonia with easel and
books, and I had a feeling that the venerable
Doctor, if his spirit ever approached
the spot where lay his dust, would deem that
I had turned his impalpable lessons to good
account.</p>

<p>All this time there were great things stirring
in the world outside; they had slight
effect upon us three. My first personal
grief was that poor Tim Short died; the
wars had knocked him about unkindly; the
unkinder railways killed him. Tim foresaw
that, although no railway to Redborough
was talked of yet, it must come in time; he
beheld in vision the Romayne Arms shorn
of its glories; he took to his bed and withered
away. The staunch old humorous
soldier lies in the shadow of Saint Apollonia's
Chapel. I think he might have lasted

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

years long, but for the threatened coming of
steam.</p>

<p>Alas, and poor Mazeppa! I had given
up riding him far, when Mrs. Lee first came
to Ford Cottage; I was a heavy weight, and
he was growing old. When we got intimate,
I used to bring the old charger down to
the river-path, and Dot would have a ride,
while I led him; and in time the child and
he became firm friends, as children and
horses will. But, as he grew infirm, I turned
him into a paddock which I hired of Tim
Short; and there we often visited him with
a gift of carrot or bread, dear old boy! I
don't know his age when I bought him in
1800; but he was the staunchest steed I
ever strode&mdash;the Launcelot of horses. When
Mavis heard he was dead, she must come to
see him at once; she was wild with grief; it
took a week to console her.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

<p>"Never mind!" she said at last, with a
kind of defiance, "I shall see Mazeppa
again. I am sure he had a soul!"</p>

<p>"O Mavis!" says Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"He <i>had</i>, mamma."</p>

<p>Soul or not, Mazeppa lies buried on Beau
Sejour lawn, and on a marble slab is the
legend&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>AS a man passes onward through the
world, there are many delights which
he necessarily must leave behind him. Were
it otherwise, what a monotoned world we
should inhabit! There comes a day when
you can no longer leap a five-barred gate;
there also comes a day when you can enjoy
Horace, whose amazing collocations of words
and metre were your abhorrence at school.
It may be asked which is better, to leap

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

gates or like Horace? I reply that there
is no comparison. Each is right at the right
time. If at eighteen you can leap your own
height, at eighty-one you may hope to be
in good form, enjoying Horace in your arm-chair.</p>

<p>All those who regret the past are strangely
unwise. If it has been a time of trouble,
hope and work for a fairer future; if of pleasure,
why, the pleasure that we have had is
as thoroughly incorporated within us as the
ox-beef we have eaten, as the vineyards we
have drunken. There are those who profess
to regret their youth, to be sorry they
can never again do what once they did. I
suppose they would like to be handsome
boys to the end of time. They ought logically
to go farther back, to shed tears over
the cozy cradle, the comforting coral, the
delicious pap, the malicious slap; to wish

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

themselves always babies. Wish it or not,
they <i>are</i> babies, as is any man who desires
to be other than he is. One would have
thought that by this time the majority of
intelligent human beings would have discovered
that their first duty is to seize the
present, without weeping about the past or
hungering for the future, and to use all their
faculties to the utmost <i>in the present</i>. No,
the lesson is unlearnt, though every event of
life teaches it.</p>

<p>To give women their due, they are much
readier to learn it than men. They understand
repose. They can quietly accept a
sunny afternoon on a lawn of the Thames,
strawberries and cream and champagne, a
perfect costume, a pleasant flirtation, without
caring twopence for what may happen
to-morrow, or what happened yesterday.
A primary use of women is to teach men

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

philosophy&mdash;not by lecture (Heaven forfend!)
but by example. That they have many
other uses not less valuable, I not only deny
not, but maintain.</p>

<p>Now, Mavis Lee, as she grew on into girlhood,
an instructive and unconscious little
philosopher, gave me continuous lessons in
repose. She was restless enough in some
senses&mdash;she chattered, laughed, joked, raced
about the lawn, did a thousand things as
rapidly as lightning. She enjoyed the
instant; she had no care for an hour ago or
an hour hence. This absolute content,
based on instinct only, is very rare. Based
on reason, it is not frequent. We find few
men who, deeming their future as certain as
their past, crush out the entire juice of the
passing moment, enjoying it as a child
enjoys a peach, as a bird enjoys its own
song. So far as I have learnt this happy

<!-- vol 1 page 254 -->

art, it was from the practice of little Mavis
Lee. Yet I fancied I had attained it by
methods of strict logic; that it sufficed me to
know that He who gave me fortunate entrance
to the universe would secure for me
an exit not less fortunate.</p>

<p>Being thirty-five years older than this
little girl, it seemed odd that she could
teach me anything. Odd also it seemed
that we were such capital companions; we
used to turn out of mornings, and wander
by the stream, when I, having previously
explored it each way, proposed often to
trace it to the sea. The idea puzzled her,
born and brought up very close to England's
centre. I had to tell her exactly what the
sea was like. If there is anything to puzzle
a man, it is to describe the sea intelligibly
to a land-born child. I found I could not
do it, hard as I tried. Having conscientiously

<!-- vol 1 page 255 -->

endeavoured to unite for her guidance the
scientific and poetic elements of the ocean,
I thought it hard when she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know where the sea is."</p>

<p>"You do, Mavis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Eynsham Pond's the sea."</p>

<p>Now Eynsham Pond, the hollow formed
by an old quarry, or time, though perhaps
two hundred feet across, is not exactly the
Atlantic; but I could not make Mavis understand
the difference, and I think she rather
resented my attempt to put her favourite
pond below any other body of water. Beside
that pond she had lingered, cherishing
fairy fancies, many a happy afternoon. It
was large enough for her. It is a lucky
thing that the human imagination has a
transfiguring power. What visions Mavis
had beside that unpoetic pond I know not;
they sufficed to cause her to disdain the sea.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 256 -->

<p>I was beginning, so far as I can judge
myself, to resemble in some degree Dr.
Henry Romayne. I should have stiffened
into omniscience, but for Mavis. She sang
as freshly as the bird that was her sponsor.
She was just in that serene, unconscious
state which is charming in childhood&mdash;the
calm of the stream before it leaps over the
cataract, and the girl becomes a woman.
There is a moment&mdash;I wonder how it comes,
and when?&mdash;of transition from the romp to
the lady, from the creature whose movements
are those of a kitten to the grace that
walks with the dainty dignity of the mother
of &AElig;neas, from the mere child to the true
woman. You are sorry to lose the child,
that pretty toy that has so much in common
with bird and flower, and tree and stream.
You are glad to greet the woman who
loves all these things, but is so far above

<!-- vol 1 page 257 -->

them all. Now where is the great poet who
shall fix the marvellous moment of change?</p>

<p>It cannot be. With some the transformation
is gradual, and there is an intervening
period of shyness and gawkiness, painful to
both the sufferer and her sympathizers; but
in higher cases I take the change to be sudden,
and that there comes the feeling of
womanhood with an irresistible intensity.
She is a woman to-day who yesterday was
a child. Why? Simply because the spirit
matures, the bud opens, the dream becomes
life. It must of course be admitted that
association with masculine youth sometimes
precipitates the change.</p>

<p>Mavis I watched with much curiosity, as
she passed on through her earlier teens, the
gayest little graceful hoyden I had ever
seen. Her feeling towards me was half
daughter, half playfellow; she called me

<!-- vol 1 page 258 -->

"papa" sometimes, but generally "Sir Edward;"
for, since Romayne had found me
out, it was vain to attempt continuance of
incognito. Being, as I have said, thirty-five
years older than Mavis, and having, as may
clearly be seen, no interest in her except as
a pretty little pupil, whose happiness I naturally
desired, I was in a position to watch
her development. I felt, indeed, much like
a highly scientific gardener, who watches
for the flowering of one of those astounding
plants&mdash;aloes I think they are&mdash;that flower
once in a century, with a noise like a park
of artillery, and usually select some inconvenient
hour for doing it.</p>

<p>Mavis went gaily on, in the unconscious
happy childish state, to a later age than is,
I suppose, common with young girls. So
far as I recollect, it was one fine Summer
morning, in 1832, that she came up to Beau

<!-- vol 1 page 259 -->

Sejour, with a look in her eyes that made
me at once think Dot with the golden hair
was a creature of the past. That aureate
iota had become a woman. Why?</p>

<p>"Sir Edward," she said, with a quite
amusing unaccustomed shyness, "will you
come down to see us to-day? A cousin of
ours arrived last night."</p>

<p>"If that cousin is not male," said I to
myself, "I'll eat her, petticoats and all."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to tell you," she
went on, coaxingly, "but Arthur has run
away from school. Very wrong of him, I
suppose; but they wanted to do something
dreadful to him, and he didn't wait to have
it done. He is mamma's sister's son; and O
he <i>is</i> so handsome!"</p>

<p>Certain psychophysiological ideas crossed
my mind. Had this runaway schoolboy
already made love to Mavis, or was it only

<!-- vol 1 page 260 -->

the little fool's natural tendency to find
something poetic in the very first male creature
she saw?</p>

<p>"Come along, Dot," I said. "We'll talk
to your cousin Arthur. What's his other
name, Mavis?"</p>

<p>"Hartopp," she said.</p>

<p>"And what is he like?"</p>

<p>"O, you'll see him presently," she said,
"if you <i>will</i> be kind enough to come.
Mamma does so want your advice about
him."</p>

<p>I knew pretty well what my advice would
be, if there were any chance of its being
taken; give the young rascal a good flogging,
and send him back to be flogged at school.
But Helen Lee would have thought me a
barbarian if I should offer such advice;
wherefore I determined to offer no advice
at all.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 261 -->

<p>Mavis and I walked down to Ford Cottage,
and found Mrs. Lee alone. Arthur had
gone out; he was restless, and did not know
what to do. At my suggestion, Mavis went
in search of him, and Mrs. Lee and I talked
over the matter.</p>

<p>"He only came here late last night," she
said. "frightening us to death. I am sure I
don't know how he found us out. He ran
away from school, about thirty miles from
here, because he had to be whipped for something
or other .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he couldn't satisfactorily
tell what. I say a boy is a coward that
doesn't suffer punishment quietly when he
deserves it."</p>

<p>"Quite true," I replied. "How old is
he?"</p>

<p>"Mavis and Arthur were born within a
week of each other."</p>

<p>I was annoyed at the thought that this

<!-- vol 1 page 262 -->

runaway schoolboy, physically of Mavis's age,
yet mentally many years younger, should
by some unlucky chance have awakened
within her that consciousness of existence.
I was annoyed that he should be a coward,
who would run away thirty miles to avoid
punishment. I was annoyed that Mrs. Lee
should be troubled with this youngster, and
that Mavis should be thrown into his company.</p>

<p>Presently there was laughter in the garden&mdash;and
in the two came, quite merrily.
They were evidently on the best of terms,
Arthur and Mavis. They might well be so,
if form indicates spirit; I never saw two
people more alike; they might have been
twins, Arthur Hartopp was the most feminine
boy of seventeen I ever saw; he
looked as if he were a girl dressed up. I
saw now why he had become a fugitive.

<!-- vol 1 page 263 -->

The common English schoolboy is as hard
as nails; he takes with equal power of resistance
a birching or a tunding; he will
fight a fellow twice his weight; he would
rather have his head punched than read a
hundred lines of Homer. Arthur Hartopp
was as fragile as a china vase of the eggshell
manufacture. Human fragility could
go no farther than this boy. It was clear
to me that associating with him could do
Mavis no harm. He was mentally more a
girl than herself.</p>

<p>So, when Mrs. Lee asked my opinion, I
meanly declined to give any. She had
written to her sister (a weeping widow
woman) and to Dr. Grindley, the master
of the school, pleading for lenient treatment.
The Doctor curtly replied:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;Send Arthur Hartopp back at

<!-- vol 1 page 264 -->

your leisure, if you think him worth sending
back. He will be treated according to the
ancient discipline of this school.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Cato Grindley</span>, D.D."</p>

<br/>

<p>I should be sorry to have to transcribe
the weeping widow's crossed epistles; the
burden of them was, "<i>Take care of Arthur</i>.
Don't let him go where the birch-tree
grows." So Arthur was taken care of, and
was not sent back to Dr. Grindley's, as he
ought to have been, and ran about the
neighbourhood with my little Mavis.</p>

<p>Well, I saw less of her than usual. She
was loving as ever to her old tutor, but
this cousin of her own age came upon her
like a charm. I was rather interested in
their intercourse, from philosophic reasons.
I desired to know whether a girl like Mavis
could tolerate a young fellow like her cousin
Arthur. He was the sort of boy that ought

<!-- vol 1 page 265 -->

to have been put on a bench, with a pinafore
on, to work a sampler. There are such
weak creatures.</p>

<p>He tired Mavis, but he made interest with
her mother, who thought him such a perfect
young gentleman. Women, having
reached a certain age, are apt to forget the
days when they preferred a man to a milksop.
To their daughters they commend the
milksop. The daughters do not always entirely
agree&mdash;small blame to them. However,
Arthur Hartopp could not be in the company
of my beautiful Mavis day after day without
feeling that wondrous magnetic attraction
that might even make a wishy-washy being
like him feel heroic; wherefore I was not
surprised when, one afternoon, Mavis came
to me, and said he had asked her to marry
him. She was very quiet about it. Indeed,
there was a laugh on her lips.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 266 -->

<p>"What do you think of him, Dot?" I
asked, she having told her story.</p>

<p>You should have seen her. She drew
herself up. She is not a short girl, my
Mavis. She stood a moment, with her hands
behind her gold-crested head, and looked
very much like Artemis in a temper. I
always mentally compared the little girl
with Artemis, by the Latins called Diana.</p>

<p>"Think of him! Dear Sir Edward, he is
dreadful! And I am so miserable about it.
I somehow or other fancied I liked him. I
made a man of him&mdash;picking up the pieces
from my own imagination. And now he
has <i>dared</i> to ask me to marry him. I was
obliged to run away, for I was afraid of
boxing his ears. Marry <i>him!</i> I'd rather
marry my grandfather!"</p>

<p>"Well, little Mavis," I said, "will you
leave the young gentleman to me? I think

<!-- vol 1 page 267 -->

I understand him. If he does what he
ought to do, he may make a place for himself
in the world; but he is not good enough
for Mavis."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "I was tired of Arthur
so soon. He is pretty to look at, but, oh!
dear me, how dull! If it had not been for
mamma's wishing it, I should have run
away. Dear Sir Edward, he is such a dreadful
boy!"</p>

<p>I kissed the child's brow. What pleasure
it gave me to think that, though association
with this new-found cousin of hers had
aided to turn the bud into a flower, she had
a classic contempt for the said cousin. If
only I could find some one worthy of my
Mavis! I fear it is impossible.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">THE TRIALS OF MAVIS LEE.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Malo, mavis, mavult."</p>

</div>

<p>THERE are some things in humanity
very difficult to account for; among
them is the behaviour of mothers to daughters.
Mothers usually allow their sons to do
much as they please; but they worry daughters
abominably, treating them much as a
hen-pigeon treats her female offspring. At
Beau Sejour I have had ample opportunity
to notice the habits of pigeons, and they
certainly offer a curious caricature of the

<!-- vol 1 page 269 -->

human race. The pigeon-mother's behaviour
to her daughter is intensely human.</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe what I saw on
Helen Lee's part. She took quite a foolish
fancy to this silly boy, and would not send
him back to Dr. Cato Grindley, who very
soon would have thrashed him into form.
She let him stay on at Ford Cottage, and
make infantile love to Mavis. The love-making
of a boy of that age is very mild,
necessarily; and Mavis got so terribly tired
of it that she took every opportunity of
running up to me at Beau Sejour for protection
and instruction. Her effeminate
cousin Arther did not dare to follow her,
for I frightened the young fool out of his
life one day when he came prowling about
my premises. I came rapidly down toward
the gate, with a dog-whip in my hand, and
followed by a leash of greyhounds that I

<!-- vol 1 page 270 -->

had set up as companions, and he ran off as
hard as he could, never re-appearing. So
Mavis was safe enough while with me.</p>

<p>I said my greyhounds were set up as
companions, but they were also of use. The
moorland around Five Tree Hill has plenty
of hares, and I had Romayne's permission to
kill as many as I chose. So I bought a
Norfolk cob for myself, and a little Exmoor
to carry Mavis, and we had the merriest days'
coursing imaginable. There was an old
fellow called Yaddles, an earth-stopper, who
came out with us and took charge of the dogs:
and by-and-by I took him entirely into my
employ, finding that he was trustworthy,
and could turn his hand to anything.</p>

<p>How we enjoyed these coursing days,
Mavis and I! The gay wind on Romayne
Moor blew her brown tresses about, and
her cheeks grew ruddy and sunburnt; and

<!-- vol 1 page 271 -->

her mad little Exmoor stallion often ran
away with her, just for fun. And then puss
was started; and away went two brace of
greyhounds after the cunning little beggar,
at their swiftest stride; and it was all we
could do to gallop fast enough to keep them
in sight. Merry mornings! How she enjoyed
them, my little Mavis! I could not
stiffen into a likeness of Doctor Romayne,
with Mavis and the greyhounds to keep life
in me.</p>

<p>Much did I ponder concerning the future
of Mavis Lee. Some old fogies might have
fallen in love with a handsome high-spirited
girl of seventeen, but I was not a fool of that
description. I have had my love. I could
not help feeling an intense and eager desire
for this child's happiness; and I determined
to leave her a few thousand pounds in my
will. She certainly deserved a good husband.

<!-- vol 1 page 272 -->

Though as full of fun as a girl in her
teens ought to be, there was sometimes a
curious gravity about her, as if she had very
decided views concerning life. She would
be quite amusingly matronly sometimes,
and she has actually lectured me when she
thought I had sat up too late or drunk a
bottle of claret too much.</p>

<p>Arthur Hartopp remained at Ford Cottage
much longer than seemed advisable;
but I said nothing to Mrs. Lee on the subject,
as she seemed to be quite fascinated
by that effeminate youth. Such things come
to an end. He bored her at last, almost as
much as he had bored Mavis; and when
she suggested to her sister that he had been
almost long enough at Ford Cottage, that
weeping widow woman wrote her one of
those fierce letters which none but the
disconsolate and lachrymose seem able to

<!-- vol 1 page 273 -->

compose. Then I was called into counsel&mdash;having
previously been rather out of favour,
because I had encouraged Mavis to
come and see me as much as possible during
young Hartopp's stay at Ford Cottage.
The conversation which I then had with
Mrs. Lee satisfied me that this young fellow
ought to be back at school again; so I sent
for a carriage and pair, took Yaddles into
my confidence, and carried Arthur Hartopp
by cross country roads to Birchanger Hall,
the residence of the Reverend Cato Grindley,
D.D. The boy didn't half like it, but
had not pluck enough to resist.</p>

<p>Doctor Cato Grindley's place is just what
a boy's school should be&mdash;a fine old Elizabethan
house, in about two hundred acres of
park and farm. Doctor Cato himself is, or
was, a model schoolmaster. I was delighted
with him. He wore a cap and gown;

<!-- vol 1 page 274 -->

he might have been of any age from fifty to
a hundred; he had a humorous twinkle
about the mouth and eye, which showed that
he was capable of understanding boys. He
insisted on my staying to dine and sleep, and
I was so amused with him that I could not
help accepting. He introduced me to his
only daughter, the lady manager of the
household, about thirty, I should think, with
a slightly suspicious and questioning look
in her eye. It must be hard work for a
lady of that age to arrange everything for a
household of about two hundred and fifty
people.</p>

<p>Doctor Cato Grindley gave me a glass of
unquestionable port, over which I asked him
what he would do with young Hartopp, and
what he thought of him generally.</p>

<p>"Well," quoth the Doctor, "he will have
to be flogged for running away. And

<!-- vol 1 page 275 -->

then I suppose we must try to teach him
something. His body and brain are of the
consistency of jelly. He will always be
useless. I would rather not have him here.
But I never refuse a pupil unless he has
done something dishonourable. The boy
is flabby; when he is flogged he will
only whimper, and wonder why it was
done. There's no dealing with that class of
youngster."</p>

<p>"What class do you like best, Doctor?" I
said.</p>

<p>He laughed. His stern yet humorous
scholastic countenance lighted up with whimsical
reminiscences.</p>

<p>"I like a thorough rebel," he said. "I
like the fellow who looks on his schoolmaster
as his natural enemy. There is real
fun in conquering a boy of that sort; they
make my best pupils; that's where I get my

<!-- vol 1 page 276 -->

high wranglers and senior classics. I
wouldn't give a dolt for a boy without a
spice of Satan in him."</p>

<p>"But are not such boys difficult to get
into order?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all. The flabby boys remain
flabby to the end; the canting boys deceive
you, and smoke bad cigars on the sly; but
the real rebel becomes your best ally when
you have conquered him. His rebellion
arises from independence of character. I
first make him obey; I then take the trouble
to show him why it is worth his while to
obey. I have one or two boys in the upper
form of this school whom I could leave to
manage the school if I were away a week.
They were rebels at first."</p>

<p>"There is something in your theory,"
I said, "which suggests a wider extension.
You make your rebels loyal. The same

<!-- vol 1 page 277 -->

process goes on with the whole human
race."</p>

<p>I enjoyed my evening with Doctor Cato
Grindley more than I could have deemed it
possible to enjoy an evening with a schoolmaster.
We chatted much on many
themes, and of course in time we came upon
Pythagoras.</p>

<p>"I hope that theory is true," he said,
pathetically. "I have been a schoolmaster
so long that I should like to be a schoolboy
for a change."</p>

<p>Leaving Master Arthur Hartopp to his
fate, which doubtless involved an irritation
of the cuticle, I returned to Five Tree Hill.
A terrible shock met me on the threshold of
Beau Sejour. Helen Lee was dead&mdash;of
heart-disease, quite suddenly. My Mavis
was an orphan. I rushed down to Ford
Cottage at once, and found the poor child

<!-- vol 1 page 278 -->

in a state of ineffable misery. O dear,
how utterly impossible it is for a man to
comfort a woman in her trouble! While,
somehow or other, a woman knows exactly
how to console a man. You can laugh with
a woman, flirt with her, enjoy life with her,
make love to her seriously or in fun, but I
defy you to console her in any great grief.
Yet in any great grief a loving woman can
console a man, having in her a faculty of
solace denied to manhood. After a pretty
long experience of life, I have reached the
definite conclusion that man is but a poor
creature. There are, I am told, exceptions,
but I never have encountered one.</p>

<p>What was to become of Mavis Lee? That
question soon had its answer. There appeared
at Five Tree Hill a short stout
fussy plethoric gentleman, with a head as
bald as a billiard-ball, and a chin close-shaven,

<!-- vol 1 page 279 -->

dressed in black apparel, with white
stockings and low shoes, and wearing the
largest gold watch and the largest diamond
ring I ever saw. He announced himself as
Mr. Arundel Lee, of the Stock Exchange,
paternal uncle to Mavis. He took charge
of everything, Mavis included.</p>

<p>"My sister-in-law mistrusted me, Sir
Edward Ellesmere," he said, "because I
was always trying to keep poor Tom&mdash;that's
my late brother&mdash;pretty straight. Tom
liked to make ducks and drakes of his
money; poor Helen always maintained he
was quite right, till one day he went too far
even for her. The story need not to be
told; I wish my niece never to hear it.
Somehow, though I did all I could at the
time, Helen fancied I might have done
more; so, though I have always managed her
money matters for her, we were never quite

<!-- vol 1 page 280 -->

such good friends after. I am Mavis's guardian
and trustee, and, as I'm a confirmed
old bachelor, I shall leave her all my money,
if she's a good girl."</p>

<p>"She is a peculiar girl," I said, "but
thoroughly good. She is sensitive and
imaginative&mdash;fond of books and of nature
out of doors. I don't think you will be
disposed to cancel your will when you have
known her for a little time."</p>

<p>This fussy little stock-broking uncle was
thoroughly kind, and of course he had a
right&mdash;indeed it was his duty&mdash;to take
charge of Mavis. She, poor child, did not
like it. In Mr. Arundel Lee there was nothing
whatever, in mind or body, to attract
her poetic temperament. He was too respectable
for Mavis. That bald head and
plain costume, <i>plus</i> watch, chain, and diamond-ring,
were worth a fortune in the City;

<!-- vol 1 page 281 -->

they did not delight a girl whose studies
and dreams were of knights and troubadours.
When we talked of heroic men, she
always said she preferred Walter of the
Bird-Meadow; he could fight, he could sing,
he could love, and he endowed with his
estate the winged minstrels of the air.
Certes, that gentle patient lover of lady
and lute, of battle and birds, was a hero fit
for any girl's fancy. Alas! there is no room
in the world for the troubadour now.</p>

<p>Mavis was sensible enough to see that her
uncle was very kind, and that it was his
duty to take charge of her; but she had a
dread of the new life she would have to encounter.
Mr. Arundel Lee lived at Clapham
Common, in a noble old red-brick
mansion, with ample grounds. But think
of this wild Mavis, untameable as her namesake
bird, exchanging for Clapham the

<!-- vol 1 page 282 -->

wild free air of Five Tree Hill, and passing
from St. Apollonia's lovely river-side chapel
to the ugly Cockney church whereof Mr.
Arundel Lee was churchwarden! It was
impossible not to apprehend her being
miserable, though her uncle evidently intended
to make her happy, and thought he
knew the way. There are natures that
would rather be unhappy in their own way
than happy in some one else's; and few
people do more harm than those who lay
down a plan of happiness, and expect others
to follow it. Procrustes was a mild tyrant
to these blundering benefactors to their
species.</p>

<p>I take credit to myself for having done
all I could to reconcile Mavis with her fate
during the short period before she left Ford
Cottage. I felt how dull Five Tree Hill
must become when my pretty lively pupil

<!-- vol 1 page 283 -->

left it; but I concealed my own annoyance,
and looked forward to the time when I
should have a good long yawn by myself
I was a downright hypocrite at that period.
I tried to persuade Mavis that Clapham was
Elysium, though I knew it was infested by
the Clapham Saints; and when she asked
what a stockbroker was, I tried to invest
that vocation with a halo of poetry.</p>

<p>The day came. The poor child had to
go. How she cried that last morning, in
Doctor Romayne's back-room, with the sun
shining on the garden and meadows and
rivulet below. That happy laughing rivulet
by Saint Apollonia's old chapel! To Mavis
and me it was a friend; and we both at that
moment thought of long joyous days passed
within hearing of its endless song. Never
more! This child was going forth into a
world which I had vowed never to re-enter.

<!-- vol 1 page 284 -->

I, a recluse, must console myself as best I
might for the loss of my spiritual daughter.
Far better than Mavis I knew how utterly
she was lost to me: but I made light of it
to her, and encouraged her to expect a
happy life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at Clapham!</p>

<p>When the bald-headed and respectable
Mr. Arundel Lee had taken Mavis away, I
walked down to Saint Apollonia's Chapel,
and pondered, while the stream sang a pleasant
Summer tune. And the outcome of
my meditation was that I had given too much
time to Mavis, and had neglected those high
studies dear to the hearts of Pythagoras and
Henry Romayne. So I resolved (how often
we resolve the impossible!) to forget Mavis
altogether, and to resume my mystical philosophy,
and to work out, in all its details,
the great theory of metempsychosis. There
were many points that demanded further

<!-- vol 1 page 285 -->

analysis; one especially being the crucial
question, whether souls have sex. This momentous
point had occupied my attention
for a long time; but Mavis had come between
me and my philosophy, as a sunbeam
shoots through the window on a schoolboy's
<i>Euclid</i>, blotting out A B C and D E F, and
bringing a vision of the green meadow and
the flowing stream.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ballad:</span> <i>tempore</i>, <span class="smcap">Charles II</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>CERTES, I was lonely. I fell back on
Dr. Romayne, and worked out some of
those difficult corollaries to the theory of
metempsychosis already indicated. I decided,
after much investigation, that there <i>is</i>

<!-- vol 1 page 287 -->

sex in souls; also that only two sexes are
possible, although certain pseudo-philosophers
have imagined a third. My treatise
on this subject, written in Latin, since it was
not addressed <i>ad popidum</i>, will probably be
printed at some future date. I was fortunate
enough .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I must not anticipate.</p>

<p>To my surprise, old Yaddles set himself
to work to cheer me up. He induced me
to go out riding or coursing. It was dull
business without Mavis; but Yaddles had a
dry humour that amused me, and so I got
into the habit of allowing him to persuade
me to take exercise.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," he would say, "I know
nothing about books, for I can't read, thank
God and my parents, but I don't think
books come up to horses and dogs. If you
get on horseback you'll get an appetite for

<!-- vol 1 page 288 -->

dinner, but I never heard tell of a book's
giving a man an appetite."</p>

<p>With such arguments the old earth-stopper
lured me into open air, and did me a deal
of good thereby. But for the humble Yaddles
I should at this time have got into a
morbid state of deadly dullness. Mavis
helped him, by the way, for she wrote to
me. This was her first letter:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Edward</span>,</p>

<p>"I hate Clapham. I hate stockbrokers.
O how dull they are! Uncle
Arundel is very kind. I love you and Five
Tree Hill. Do, do, do send me some
wonderful problem to puzzle my poor little
brain!</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Mavis</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>So I sent her some of the perplexing
nonsense which clever girls have a fancy

<!-- vol 1 page 289 -->

for. She liked absurd mathematical conundrums,
and to have to show that, if there are
more people in the world than any one of them
has hairs on his head, there must be at least
two people with an equal number of hairs
on their heads. It is my conviction she contributed
enigmas and mathematical paradoxes
to that marvellous annual, the <i>Ladies'
Diary</i>. When she was taken away from
Five Tree Hill and given over to that confoundedly
respectable bald-headed member
of the Stock Exchange, with his big diamond,
and his gold chronometric turnip, she was
beyond reach of the influences that had
made her what she was. No more mystical
lectures in the old doctor's book-room; no
more wandering in search of rare ferns
where the shadow of Saint Apollonia lay
across the rippling stream; no more coursing
the cunning hare on pleasant mornings,

<!-- vol 1 page 290 -->

before the mist had left the moor. No, it
was all Clapham for Mavis.</p>

<p>Worse, by-and-by. The stockbroker uncle
considered that her education had been
neglected, and determined to send her to
school, to learn what are called "accomplishments."
The school was at Brixton,
Clapham's uglier sister, and Mavis described
the mistress to me as being something between
Lady Macbeth and a washerwoman.
The vigorous rules of this establishment
compelled poor Mavis to pass all her letters
through the mistress's hands. Thanks to
that, and the high rate of postage, I had
news of her but seldom.</p>

<p>Month after month at this time I grew
more tired of the dullness of things, more
inclined to settle down to my books and
papers, and forget the outer world, with all
its annoyances and all its excitements. I

<!-- vol 1 page 291 -->

was growing tired. While that merry, suggestive
little Mavis was about, prattling her
nonsense, playing her pranks, finding delight
in a wild flower, and fun in a sudden rainstorm,
my spirits kept up. Now they began
to flag. I looked back wearily on a lost
life. A strange somnolence came over me;
my brain would not work; I fell into a kind
of apathy. Man delighted me not, nor
woman neither; nor the joy of morning,
when the birds run wild to see the sun
again; nor the cloud-frigates in the sea of
Summer sky; nor books, learned, or humorous,
or poetic; nor my dinner. I seemed
to have lost all appetite&mdash;I cared for
nothing but sleep. In my long sleep I had
delicious dreams&mdash;sometimes of my later
years, with Mavis as my companion, and the
heather-clad moor, and the greyhounds, and
the old chapel; oftener of the rose-garden

<!-- vol 1 page 292 -->

at Twickenham, and Lucy's magic touch and
mellow voice.</p>

<p>Sleep is a fragment of death, and dreams
are a revelation of immortality. Some men
don't dream. As Coleridge remarked, "Such
men are never poets." Indeed, it may
greatly be doubted whether they are not
what Doctor Romayne, with graphic emphasis,
called <i>dolls</i>. It is quite certain that
dolls don't dream. What could they dream
about except dolls of the opposite sex they
had seen in the toyshop before they came
out into the world?</p>

<p>A doctor from Redborough came over to
see me now and then. His name was
Tranter, and he was the most cheerful old
boy I ever knew. 'Tis a pity doctors cannot
always be cheerful; the infectious animal
spirits of a doctor are of more value by far
than all the drugs your scientific physician

<!-- vol 1 page 293 -->

can order to be administered. Tranter
used to laugh at my fancies, call me a
hypochondriac, or some such name, wake
me out of my lethargy by his own vital
energy. Tranter was a dull fellow&mdash;all his
schoolmasters laughed at him; but what
they wanted to teach him was just what a
plain healthy intellect like his could not
assimilate. Offer Strasbourg pie, with all
its truffles, to a labourer used to bread and
cheese and onions, and he will probably be
disgusted.</p>

<p>Tranter did me good, I suppose. He
kept me awake. I came to look for his
visits. He was a brusque doctor, accustomed
to scold poor people thoroughly if
they did not get well when they ought.
He used to tell me with great glee how he
shocked the "lady" of a rich Redborough
manufacturer. She had one daughter, about

<!-- vol 1 page 294 -->

twelve, whom she spoilt, feeding her into
chronic indigestion with all sorts of nice
things, and allowing her to pass a lazy life,
without movement of the mind. When
Tranter was called in, he saw at once what
was the matter, so he wrote a prescription
in some such terms as these:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whip her once a week at least. Make
her learn to read and write. Give her
nothing for dinner but roast meat and suet-pudding.
Send her to bed at eight."</p>

<p>The lady was shocked. She called in a
fashionable doctor named Ozanne, who had
recently set up a system called hom&oelig;opathy,
which seems to mean the administering of
particles of sugar in all diseases. Ozanne
took the girl in hand, and made her a great
deal worse. He did not kill her, however;
and I have heard that she became a more
languid fine lady than her mamma.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 295 -->

<p>Tranter cheered me up, certainly. He
always had a new story of politics or society.
Between the papers and his clients he was
always full of news; and he came into your
room like a fresh breeze, waking you up by
sheer vital force. He wanted me to "rouse
myself."</p>

<p>"You are young," he said. "Living in
this quiet way is not good for you. Why
not go to London and amuse yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am not exactly young, Doctor," I
answered; "but I believe your advice is
good if I could take it. Nothing would
amuse me now. I got past the age of
possible amusement too early."</p>

<p>"Yours is a mental malady," he said,
"and I have no medicine for a mind diseased.
You have stayed in this old house,
among old books, till you're as melancholy
as an old rat that has passed all his life in

<!-- vol 1 page 296 -->

the same drain-pipe. If you don't shake
yourself up, you'll just fall into a state of
permanent stupidity."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"Do! Anything fresh. Go to London
and see the world; it must have changed
since you settled in this corner so many
years ago. It does any man harm to isolate
himself, whatsoever his reasons. You
are your own master, Sir Edward; pack
your portmanteau, and change the air for
awhile."</p>

<p>Such was Tranter's advice. I took it.
Though threats of coming steam had saddened
the heart of Timothy Short, steam
was only rampant in the far north, and I
had still the pleasure of travelling by stage-coach.
I determined to be in London a
few days only; so I took the least possible
amount of luggage. I left the Romayne

<!-- vol 1 page 297 -->

Arms late at night; I reached the White
Horse Cellar in Piccadilly early in the morning&mdash;so
early that I went to bed, and slept
off the fatigue of the journey.</p>

<p>When, a few hours later, I descended to
the coffee-room and looked out upon Piccadilly,
I thought that perhaps I had done
wisely to leave my hermitage and take one
more look at the great metropolis. I could
not, however, help feeling my perfect loneliness
in London. There were, of course,
people who, if I found them out, would try
to get up a languid interest in me, but I
should be just like an old-fogyish ghost to
them. I had no desire to re-appear in that
way. I determined to look at the outside
of London life, and remain unrecognised.</p>

<p>I walked into White's that morning. I
had a right there, having kept my name on
the books all these years. I was slightly

<!-- vol 1 page 298 -->

stared at by gentlemen of my own standing,
who looked a good deal older than I; and
I consoled myself with the notion that, if
Five Tree Hill had done nothing else for
me, it had kept my skin from becoming
vellum, and had left some vigour in my
vertebr&aelig;. As I walked among men clearly
my compeers, I felt as if I insulted them by
being in such splendid form&mdash;"Tranter,
thou reasonest well," I said to myself, after
my first slight look at London.</p>

<p>I secured a stall at the Opera at Sams's;
it was a great night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Grisi's first appearance
in <i>Norma</i>. I am no musician, though
I heartily love the concord of sweet sounds;
but the young soprano's voice was so lovely,
and her acting so perfect, that an uneducated
fellow like myself could not help understanding
her supremacy among singers. I
often have wondered whether it is better to

<!-- vol 1 page 299 -->

comprehend, or not to comprehend, the
technic part of music, My friends have told
me that I know good music from bad; I
really cannot guess why. Only there is some
music that is as thorough a charm as the song
of nightingales, and there is some music that
resembles the butchers' serenade of marrow-bones
and cleavers.</p>

<p>I always sleep well after pleasant music.
It excites the brain at the moment, and
calms it afterwards. The effect is something
like that of a waterfall; it dashes over the
precipice with a myriad caprices of foam and
sparkle; it sleeps tranquilly in the deep pool
below. Montaigne's father always had him
awakened by music; I should prefer being
put to sleep that way, if I could get the sort
of music I liked.</p>

<p>I don't think I have mentioned the unimportant
fact that my hair and beard and moustache

<!-- vol 1 page 300 -->

had, within the last year or two, turned
very white, an excellent disguise for me
in wanderings through London, when at
any turn I might meet a friend. It would
be impossible to put into words my feelings
as I looked again at the old old places
where I had lived my youthful life. Fancy
me at the Horse Guards! 'Gad, how many
a time I had turned out the Guards in that
precious old Court Yard! What would they
say to me now? I never drive when I can
ride; so I hired a horse and groom, and
went down to Clapham Common, to call
on Mr. Arundel Lee, stockbroker. Unluckily,
he was at home, and Mavis was not.
He received me with that unpleasant mixture
of servility and assumption which I often
have perceived in persons of his class. He
assured me that Miss Lee was greatly improved
by the course of study which she had

<!-- vol 1 page 301 -->

pursued at the Brixton seminary. Mavis
came in while he was talking; recognised
me, despite my whitened hair; shocked the
stockbroker by throwing her arms round my
neck, and crying as she kissed me. Why
not, poor child? The uncle was a very
good fellow, but I'll be hanged if he could
understand my Mavis. He invited me to
dinner, and I came and dined .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and did
not criticize, since Mavis's presence made up
for his cook's and butler's blunders. He was
very very slow; but he went to sleep after
his first glass of port; and then my little
girl came close to me, and put her pretty
tremulous hand in mine, and wished she
belonged to me. Yes, she ought to have
been my daughter.</p>

<p>I got a box at the Opera for Grisi's <i>Adelgisa</i>,
a night or two later, and the bald-headed
uncle consented to come, and snored all

<!-- vol 1 page 302 -->

through the performance. As we had put
him in a back seat, it did not greatly matter.
Mavis and I enjoyed our evening; only, the
poor child's delight in seeing me was so
great that I felt sure she would suffer from
the subsequent reaction. She was content
enough, I found, with her uncle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a kind
dull fellow, who gave her all she wanted,
except the difficult intimacy of the soul. He
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was a financier. He thought money
compensated all things. He regarded it as
the common measure of human affairs. If a
girl whom he liked had lost her father or
mother, he would try to console her with a
costly bracelet. You cannot get this fixed
idea out of some men. You cannot teach
them that it is absolutely impossible to
buy the song of a mavis or of a poet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the love of a girl or of a dog. These are
things beyond gold.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 303 -->

<p>As we sat in our box that night, I, certain
of unrecognition, swept the "glittering horse-shoe"
with a powerful opera-glass, to gratify
my curiosity as to whether any old friends
or acquaintances were in the house. Suddenly
I started; a lady sat in the opposite box,
her royally rounded arm leaning on the
velvet verge. Her hair was as white as
mine; it was sprinkled with rubies and
flowers. She had been magnetised by the
beautiful young singer, but my gaze had
surpassed that magnetism.</p>

<p>She turned from the stage. She looked
across the theatre. She knew me, and
trembled. It was Lucy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">LUCY.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dies ilia."</p>

</div>

<p>LUCY at fifty or thereabouts&mdash;a white-haired
widow, yet still superb and
noble&mdash;with a son of marriageable years.
What a chasm to pass from the old Twickenham
days! The knowledge that she had
known me at first sight was a solace to me.
I loved her still; although there is sex in
souls there is no age&mdash;if there were, the
soul could not be immortal. That which
grows old, dies.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 305 -->

<p>Sitting that night at my hotel, meditative,
frugally supping on an anchovy and a pint
of port, I asked myself whether I should go
and see Lucy. I had ascertained that her
husband was dead. I was heartily sorry for
Lesbury&mdash;a thorough gentleman, who well
deserved the good fortune of having Lucy
for a wife&mdash;and to say a man deserved that,
is praise enough for the noblest fellow
that ever breathed. I thought over the
matter till the morning seemed likely to
overtake my ruminations; then I went off to
bed, postponing my decision till the next
morning. When morning came, I resolved
that I would call. Nearly four decades had
passed since we were obliged to separate,
and those years must surely have brought to
both the philosophic mind.</p>

<p>So I sought her that next afternoon, in
St. James's Square, at the family residence;

<!-- vol 1 page 306 -->

and there I found her. She had expected
me, denying herself to all other comers. She
was in a room, half conservatory, half
library, with a thousand different roses
blooming around her. I thought of the
Twickenham rose-garden. My strong and
loving youth came back to me. The Duke
of Rochefoucauld says that youth is a fever;
ah, it is a fever too soon cured.</p>

<p>"I knew you," said Lucy. "I knew you
would come. How much we have suffered
through the folly of my poor brother! What
we have lost!"</p>

<p>The whole thing was fresh in her memory
still. She had been a happy wife, and was
a happy mother; but the roses and nightingales
of Twickenham still haunted her. Her
half-century had not made her less a
girl.</p>

<p>"As I had to give you up, Lucy," I said,

<!-- vol 1 page 307 -->

"there was no man in the world save
Lesbury to whom I would have so willingly
resigned you. He was of noble mould, and
I knew you would be happy with him. But
now let us think of the past; let us try to
drop all those terrible years that have
whitened our hair and taken the vigour out
of us. Let us recall the Twickenham rose-garden."</p>

<p>"And sing songs of the olden time," she
said with a pleasant laugh. "Come, we two
old fogies will have our flirtation. Ronald
is gone abroad; I heard from him last at
Venice; I wish he were at home, for I should
much have liked you to see him. He is a
good boy."</p>

<p>"It would be strange if he were not," I
said, "being your son and dear old Lesbury's.
I have lived a lonely life; but in
my solitude I have learned many things, and

<!-- vol 1 page 308 -->

one is, that self-sacrifice brings a reward. At
this moment I feel strangely happy that
yours has been a happy life with Lesbury,
and that your son is a noble young fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, he <i>is</i> a noble young fellow," she
said; "and if I can see him well married, I
shall die happy."</p>

<p>I thought how Mavis might suit him, but
I said nothing. I could make Mavis rich
enough to be a good match for young Lord
Lesbury. However, I said nothing, which
perhaps was fortunate. It did not occur to
me that Lucy might be mistaken as to her
son's nobility of character. She was.</p>

<p>"Will you come and dine with me at
Twickenham to-day?" said Lucy&mdash;Lady Lesbury.</p>

<p>"At Twickenham?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you think me a fool?
Ralph didn't. He bought the house for me,

<!-- vol 1 page 309 -->

and there it stands, furnished in its old fashion;
and I often go down to look at the
roses. Ralph was never jealous of my memory
of you, sir; he often wished you could
be persuaded to come and see us; but he
knew your obstinate temper far too well to
ask you."</p>

<p>"Ralph Lesbury was a man of royal
nature," I said. "I wish I could grasp his
hand, and thank him for his kind remembrance
of me. We shall see him again,
Lucy&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said. "His soul was
immortal. But now, will you come to
Twickenham?"</p>

<p>"Will I not?"</p>

<p>"We will play at boy and girl again.
We will try to conjure up the old, old days.
Goodness me, how things have changed!
We were at war with Bonaparte, weren't

<!-- vol 1 page 310 -->

we? Now we are only at war with each
other. People are beginning to travel by
steam, I hear. And they have passed a
Reform Bill; but I couldn't get anybody to
explain what it meant."</p>

<p>We dined that day at the old house at
Twickenham. 'Twas a curious reminder of
my youthful past. Lucy and I had some
stewed eels, and lamb cutlets with asparagus,
and an iced pudding, and drank champagne
therewith, and made believe very
hard that we were as young as we had been
ere the century approached its teens.
We enjoyed our absurd little comedy. We
went out amid the abundant roses, and
did our best to regard them as the roses
of the past. The wise world would have
regarded us as a couple of old fools; but
we had real pleasure that evening, nevertheless.
When men and women are old, it is

<!-- vol 1 page 311 -->

something that they can remember their
youth. Happier those who can renew it.</p>

<p>Lucy and I had our pleasant talk in the
dear old rose-garden; and I said to her,
over and over again, that the soul grows not
old. She was a girl that night, and I a
boy; what were the toil and moil and wear
and tear of life to us? We were young again.
I was quite as much in love with Lucy the
widow, as I ever had been with Lucy the
maid.</p>

<p>Although loth to leave London, and Lucy
and Mavis, I left at last; feeling that the
whirl of the metropolis wearied my brain.
Of Mavis I saw very little after this period,
for she had fallen in love with somebody
or other, and was enjoying the new sensation.
I learnt before I left town that he
was one Charles Marchmont, a stockbroker,
and that Mr. Arundel Lee fully approved

<!-- vol 1 page 312 -->

the match. I was the less loth to leave
Lucy, because her son was coming home to
be nursed, having caught a low fever in
Rome, So I went to my den at Beau
Sejour, and was not sorry to shrink into my
shell, like a snail.</p>

<p>The history of the next few years is very
void of incident. I found myself gradually
feebler than of yore. I could not read, or
write, or walk as before. Yaddles helped
me; Yaddles turned out the prince of
helpers; the faithful fellow slept on a rug
at my chamber door, that he might be
ready to help me, if I were ill. What
could I do to requite such dog-like kindness?
I left him a hundred a year in my
will, and I devoutly hope it was not too
much for him.</p>

<p>Doctor Tranter was good enough to say
that he thought my brain was softening. I

<!-- vol 1 page 313 -->

don't think it was. I sank gradually into a
kind of luxurious apathy. I passed hours
in meditative quietude, thinking over all I
had learnt from dear Doctor Romayne.
An ode of Horace, a mutton-chop, and a
glass of port, formed my usual refreshment.
I began to feel very much like a tortoise.
But there were moments when I awoke,
and there came a lightning flash of power,
and I wrote an epigram or a sonnet.</p>

<p>It was, I believe, about the Spring of
1840 that I became of very little use to
myself or anyone else. My fast life had
told on me, and, though what I call a
young man, I was growing weaker daily
through a general decay of the faculties; so
I grew more and more tortoise-like, and
less and less liable to surprise. Wherefore
I was not surprised at all when, one day,
Lady Lesbury appeared at my bedside, and

<!-- vol 1 page 314 -->

took complete charge of me. Dear Lucy!</p>

<p>There is nothing that requires scientific
investigation so much as the severance of
the soul from the body. In a large number
of instances it occurs suddenly, and
there is no time to think about it; also, in
many cases it occurs in connection with
keen physical pain, which paralyzes thought.
It would be the germ of a great scientific
discovery if you could take a famous professor
(say Tyndall or Huxley), put him to
death by very mild and very gradual means,
and take down his remarks as the events
occurred.</p>

<p>In some such way I died, without remarks.
There were days when my poor
old worn-out brain woke up again, and
Lucy and I had quite pleasant little flirtations.
She entirely understood me at this
period, and knew the vanity of my attempting

<!-- vol 1 page 315 -->

what was beyond me, and wisely advised
me to leave the general inquiry unprosecuted.
"If a man can't die quietly in
the country, I've no patience with him,"
was the remark made by an unromantic
maid-servant. Lucy and I made merry
over this utterance of hers, wondering how
she would fret when should come the time
for her to shuffle off this mortal coil, and
pass into the Infinite Presence.</p>

<p>It was for me a happy thing indeed that
the only lady I had ever loved could sit by
my bedside at this crisis. There was no
malady possible, Lucy being present. It
would have been ridiculous to feel illness
while her keen eyes looked at me&mdash;while
her merry laughter cheered me. She was
a splash of sunlight on the world, leaving
warmth and beauty wherever she passed.</p>

<p>Still, though <i>clara luce refulsit</i>, she could

<!-- vol 1 page 316 -->

not bring one immortality. I think the
thing might be done if a man were taken
young enough; but I had lived far too fast
to be a worthy theme for experiment. I
began to wish for a change of <i>venue</i>. There
is no knowing what the future may be, I
thought. It would be confoundedly hard
if I did not get a better innings than on the
present occasion. I began to regard myself
from the point of view of the <i>spectator ab
extra</i>, and to wonder what would happen to
the <i>corpus vile</i>, when the spirit took its
flight.</p>

<p>There is great difficulty in severing what
I discerned and actually knew at the time,
from what I learnt in long succeeding years.
This is certain&mdash;Lucy was with me to the
last. Gradually I grew weaker and weaker,
less and less caring for the actual world,
more and more ready to enter another

<!-- vol 1 page 317 -->

world, which I had never dreaded. It had
always been my belief God did not create you
to be afraid of Him; that opinion has grown
to certainty during my unparalleled career.
What He desires from His creatures is faith
and love.</p>

<p>Faith and love waxed stronger in me as
material force waxed weaker. I seemed to
see the world across the inevitable river of
death. I felt a happy relief in a nobler and
less mutilated future. It is quite impossible
for me to make intelligible to my readers
the joyous certainty that came upon me. I
tried very hard at the time to explain it to
Lucy, but could not raise energy enough to
find the necessary words. I was passive,
awaiting the touch of the Death-angel's
releasing wand.</p>

<p>I can remember the sweet Summer evening,
with windows wide open, at Beau

<!-- vol 1 page 318 -->

Sejour, and exquisite music of bird and
brook. I can remember the sunlight streaming
aslant into my room. I can remember
Lucy by my bedside&mdash;yes, the very same
Lucy for whom roses were wont to grow,
and nightingales to sing. I can remember
how she talked of the past as she held my
attenuate hand in hers, how she called back
the irrecoverable days, the happy hours of
evenglome, the time when we were to be
one for ever. I can remember the doctor.
Tranter, who sagely said,</p>

<p>"Lady Lesbury, you will make yourself
ill if you wait upon our patient so carefully.
It really is not necessary."</p>

<p>Lucy said nothing, but held my hand in
hers.</p>

<p>I can remember a lawyer coming, to know
if I would add codicils to my will; but I
had left the bulk of my property to Lucy

<!-- vol 1 page 319 -->

and a nice little settlement to Mavis, and
was quite satisfied. I can remember the
Rector of Redborough coming to administer
my final communion, when I amazed him
by quoting an ancient hymn of the Church
that haunted my worn-out memory&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Surgit Christus e sepulcro,
Solo Deitatis fulcro
Nixus, dum humanitas
Superat miserias,
Ut nos surgeremus rei
In humilitate Dei;
Nobis est victoria."</p>

</div>

<p>Ay, as I lay there, gradually severing
soul from body, gradually moving forward
to solve the great secret, the words <i>Nobis
est victoria</i> sounded through my heart like
the triumphant call of a bugle.</p>

<p>I died! When I died, Lucy held my
hand, while it grew colder and colder,
sitting silently by my bedside. When the
servants came upstairs, to see if anything

<!-- vol 1 page 320 -->

was needed, they found me dead. They
found Lucy dead also. Her sweet pure
loving spirit had taken flight with mine.</p>

<p class="stanza">The Castle hall was marvellous high,
Its ceiling sky, and yet not sky;
Its front a single window-pane,
    Bright as fire and keen as ice:
Higher it was than Sarum vane,
Wider it was than sanguine Seine,
    From a diamond vast a thin-cut slice.
Thin! 'Twas thinner, the Sisters knew,
Than any rose-leaf that ever grew.
Than leaf of gold that is hammered flat,
Than gauzy wing of the dancing gnat.
Than the haze in summer that veils the holt&mdash;
Yet would it flatten a thunderbolt.
Sweet to see the long light slant
Through that infrangible adamant.</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Ladder of Light</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>I AWOKE. I found myself free from all
the evils and wrappages of humanity.

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

I was in a great hall, whose floor and roof
and sides were all transparent&mdash;translucent;
through them I could see the earth below
(for this hall was suspended in mid-air) and
the planets above, and the battle of the
winds outside.</p>

<p>I could not see myself&mdash;I was formless,
and traversed ether like a flame. It was a
new sensation, and a very pleasant one. To
get rid of one's clothes at eventide is no
common luxury; but to get rid of the body,
the spirit's clothing, that precious old suit
for which one feels one was never properly
measured, is a delight unutterable. I
enjoyed being immaterial, and heartily
hoped it would last.</p>

<p>The magnificent Hall of Spirits wherein I
found myself was a palace of light and
beauty. It was immense; its walls were
thin slices of diamonds, thin as a butterfly's
wing, cut from stones of enormous size,

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

which would have appalled the terrestrial
diamond merchant&mdash;who is usually also a
bill-discounter. Not long had I regarded
the scene around me, when another flying
flame came close to me, and I learnt by
strange intuition (no words being spoken)
where I was, and what I must be. This
shapeless wonder of the sky was a messenger-angel;
from him I learnt that, before
returning to the earth in another shape, I
must pass a certain time in another star. <i>I
could choose my own star!</i></p>

<p>This was confoundedly embarrassing.
There was not only the whole solar system
at my service, but also Sirius and Aldebaran
and Rigol, and a great many other stars
about which one would like some information.
I thought at first of trying the lost
Pleiad, being of opinion that lost stars, like
lost women, are those most easily found;
but I finally decided in favour of the planet

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

Mars. "It comes within forty-six million
miles of the earth," I said to myself, "and
that's like being a next-door neighbour
among planets." I confess that I longed
for my own old planet. What with Radicals
and wiseacres, our globe is rather used
up; but I like it very much, and I never so
thoroughly understood my liking as when I
was in the glorious diamond-built Hall of
Spirits. I felt that it would be an unspeakable
luxury to have legs and arms again,
and to drink vile beer in a wayside inn of
England! My experience is that the spirit
gets chilly without the body, and that the
finest a&euml;rial arrangements compensate not
for the loss of one's own book-room and
wine-cellars. The Hall of Spirits was a
splendid bit of architecture; but you could
not call it snug. I, although divested of
my corporeal attire, felt that I should prefer
a little comfort to all this radiancy. I

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

wished myself back at Five Tree Hill.</p>

<p>Many flying flames passed through the
Hall of Spirits while I was there, and by
their colours I learnt to know them. That
mysterious messenger, Raphael the hierarch,
kept close to me awhile. From him I
learnt that the red flames were the spirits
of men of war, the green flames of men
who loved the common things of earth, the
blue flames of those who delighted in the
a&euml;rial realms of poetry. The intermediate
tints denoted heterogeneous intellects. An
Emperor came through the Hall of Spirits
while I was there, and his flame was of an
orange colour. In him had blended the
green of earthly delight and the red of
fierce warfare.</p>

<p>I cannot explain how it was I learnt from
Raphael the innumerable things he had to
tell me. No words passed. Our flames
blended&mdash;that was all. The junction mysterious

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

told me all I wished to know. I
learnt that almost all the spirits coming
from Earth, or any other star, passed through
the water of Lethe, and forgot altogether
what had previously occurred to them.
None were excepted, save those who heartily
believed in the doctrine of metempsychosis;
I, being such a believer (the only one
during more than a century), was to be
rewarded by a return to earth, with my
memory of previous events perfectly clear.
But this not yet. I was to abide awhile in
the Hall of Spirits; thence I was to pass to
the planet I had chosen, and spend some
time there.</p>

<p>I confess that I very much liked the
arrangement. In time my home-sick fancy
for earth faded away, and I grew satisfied
with this radiant dwelling between sky and
sea. An existence entirely free from all
the inconveniences of earthly life has much

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

to recommend it. A flame-like spirit cannot
well be worried with rheumatism or
creditors; the <i>Saturday Review</i> does not
reach the Hall of Spirits. That Hall is a
glorious and delicious place of rest; it is
every way translucent. Below, through
the diamond floor, the earth lies beneath
you, and, as it revolves on its axis, city
after city, country after country, become
visible. Looking down through the clear
air, you can see the very places you knew
on earth; I made out Five Tree Hill, and
wondered who had come to live at Beau
Sejour.</p>

<p>Then around us was the infinite ether,
sometimes cool blue, sometimes darkened
by storm, sometimes filled with amazing
colour by sunrise or sunset. Vast birds of
lovely plumage and most melodious song
were often seen and heard. From Raphael
I learnt that the upper air is inhabited by

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

innumerable birds, which never descend on
the earth. They haunt the atmosphere far
above the peaks of the highest mountains,
and make their nests on asteroids, which
perpetually revolve through the higher
regions of the earth-encircling air.</p>

<p>Looking upward through the adamantine
ceiling, we saw stars swimming in the calm
blue sky; and, by some strange power of
the diamond disc, it was possible to see who
dwelt in those stars, and what manner of
people they were. The creatures inhabiting
them widely differed&mdash;the inhabitants of
Jupiter being of somewhat a Johnsonian
turn, while creatures of a lighter type resided
in Mercury. The people of Venus
were very much like the inhabitants of our
own planet, but perhaps slightly more
erotic.</p>

<p>Through the wondrous roof we saw this
universe of planetary life; through the floor

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

was visible the revolving earth, with all its
events, so important to the people dwelling
there, so intensely unimportant to a disembodied
spirit. Once live without material
clothing, and you become thoroughly convinced
of the absurdity of those wars in
which people hack away at each other's
bodies. Many another thing seemeth also
absurd; when a small green flame has
passed through the Hall of Spirits, I have
marvelled at the difference of its dimensions
from the splendidly-arranged creature who
represented it below. How very little soul
serves to sustain a rather magnificent body,
with even more magnificence of silk and
satin and the like!</p>

<p>In the Hall of Spirits I stayed not long,
though long enough to learn a few valuable
lessons. I learnt that the importance of a
man, when disembodied, is seldom in proportion
to his importance when on earth.

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

When that dirty yellow soul of an emperor
arrived&mdash;a flame like that of a farthing rushlight&mdash;there
came also the perfectly blue
clear fire of a great poet, burning with an
intense purity that filled all the vicinage
with light. Emperor and poet had their
positions thoroughly reversed in the Hall of
Spirits. Of course the poet was one who
would not have condescended to speak to
an emperor in his mundane existence; but
in the eyes of idiots the imperial adventurer,
with a nation under his thumb, was a more
fortunate man than the quiet poet, who
lived on lyrics of love. Look at the contrast
now. See that pure blue flame burning
like sapphire struck by sunlight. See
the emperor's yellow rushlight dimly struggling
with the darkness. Which of the
twain enters eternity with happier omen?</p>

<p>Time seemed to vanish in this higher
sphere. I cannot say how long it was that

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

I sojourned in the Hall of Spirits before
passing to the planet Mars. I know that
in course of time I so thoroughly enjoyed
the freedom of spiritual life that I felt
loth to submit to the tyranny of fleshly form
again. I made the acquaintance of an Irish
poetess, a flame half red half green, with
whom I carried on what on earth would be
called a flirtation. Indeed, we actually
embraced each other, and I felt uncommonly
like Ixion when he embraced a cloud.
There was a certain ethereal pleasure in
mingling two flames, but I think both the
poetess and I regretted at that moment our
transition into an immaterial sphere. Love-making
grows rather dull when your charmer
has not only no petticoats, but no waist to
hang them on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mars</span>. I got there all on a sudden, without
any warning. The managers of <i>post-mortem</i>
adventures are perhaps a little too

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

abrupt. I found myself in the fleshly apparel
of a Mars-man, walking up to a village
inn on that planet. The scene was curious.
It was rather late at night, but the radiant
hue of the red Mars atmosphere made things
easily visible. When I had resided some
time on Mars I met with a distinguished
chemist, who informed me that their atmosphere
is composed of three gases, oxygen,
nitrogen, and pyrogen. The latter, a gas
unknown on earth, gives the atmosphere a
ruddy hue, and produces that heat which
drives all the snow of the planet to its two
poles.</p>

<p>I walked through the lighted doorway of
a village inn. I found, on the following day,
that it was called the "Ghost and Gridiron."
I noticed, in course of time, that the inns
in Mars had odd signs, and the people and
places odd names. Quite right, as they did
odd things. A portly inn-keeper welcomed

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

me on my arrival, asked whether I would
like supper, sent me to see my room in the
company of a buxom chambermaid. Everything
was delightful. The room was airy,
the bed clean, the chambermaid coy, the
landlord jolly. I supped on rump-steak,
with sauce made of a Mars shellfish; but
the steak was cut from a creature far superior
to our ordinary ox, and the shellfish
was more delicious than the best Whitstable
oysters. I drank therewith a malt liquor of
the landlord's own brewing, much better
than London stout of Meux or Whitbread.</p>

<p>Well I slept. I was conscious of something
in the air which rendered it quite different
from my native telluric atmosphere.
I learnt, in time, that it was the wonderful
gas pyrogen, heretofore mentioned, which
does not exist in any other planet of the
solar system. This gas has such healthful
power that I found there was not a single

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

doctor on the surface of Mars. The profession
is unknown. People die of nothing
but old age. There are centenarians enough
to make Mr. Thoms tear his hair.</p>

<p>It was eventide when I somehow or
other found myself at the doorway of the
"Ghost and Gridiron." I had not noticed
its situation. When morning came,
I found that it was in a picturesque village;
a noble church, embowered in woodland,
rose right opposite me, and I felt glad
at heart that the people of Mars were a
religious people. It was a glorious Summer
morning. I dressed rapidly. I found
that the fates which directed my path had not
only invested me in a costume such as the
people of Mars wear, but had also placed in
my pocket a purse of the Mars coinage. It
was of extreme beauty, delightfully designed
and clearly cut. On one side was a
crowned head in profile, with a legend

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

to me unintelligible; on the other was
the archangel Michael slaying the devil.
Satan, with a spear through his breast, and
the archangelic foot on his throat, looked
pretty well done for.</p>

<p>For breakfast, if I may mention such a
trifle, I had coffee, and the thinnest curls of
forest bacon, and ripe peaches, and a cream
like that of Devon. When it was finished,
and I had strolled into the village and wondered
at its quaintnesses, I asked the landlord
for my bill.</p>

<p>He looked amazed.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, "I don't know where
you may come from, but I thought everybody
knew that His Majesty the King keeps
up all the inns, and that nobody is allowed
to pay for anything. I suppose you've
been living in some far away country place,
and haven't heard of our great Reform Bill.
Why, sir, we've abolished money. It saves

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

such a lot of trouble. If you want anything
you've only to ask for it, and nobody is allowed
to refuse. I'm sure I hope you got a
dinner and breakfast that you liked. I take
as much pleasure in serving any customer
now that they don't pay for it."</p>

<p>I wanted my jovial landlord to accept
some coin, but he assured me that money
was useless in Mars, and that anyone attempting
to pay for anything would, if found
out, be publicly flogged. As I had no desire
to commence my career in the planet
with such contumely, I did not insist on
paying my bill.</p>

<p>I wandered out that morning into the
pleasant village, desirous of ascertaining what
manner of planet I had come to inhabit.
Methought a visit to the church would be
a good commencement. When I came to
walk towards it, I found it was much farther
off than it seemed; and I then got the first

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

inkling of the fact, which I subsequently established,
that in the atmosphere of Mars
you see much farther than in our planet.
An eminent chemist of Mars has shown very
clearly the reason of this, but the demonstration
is too abstruse to be inserted here.</p>

<p>To my surprise, between me and the
church there was a lake as wide as Windermere,
When I reached the margin, I found
a ferry boat, with a very pretty girl ready
to ferry me across; and here, in anticipation
of the chapter which I have to write on
the ladies of Mars, I may perhaps be allowed
to say that I never saw one ugly woman
on that planet. Whether it is the pyrogen
in the atmosphere, or the absence of money,
I don't know; but they are all lovely, and
they last lovely. The canon forbidding a
man to marry his grandmother would have
some significance in Mars.</p>

<p>The ferry-girl took me across. It was

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

quite half a mile, but she would not let me
help her. When I asked her what there
was to pay for the ferry, she requested me
to give her a kiss&mdash;which I did without
hesitation. I began to think Mars by no
means an unpleasant place of residence for
a gentleman of genial and expansive tastes.</p>

<p>When I came within the shadow of that
church, it amazed me. I knew Sarum
spire: this was far higher. More amazing
was it that trees stood around, higher than
the spire itself. I was gazing in perfect awe
at the glorious church and the grander
woodland, when I heard a sound near me,
and beheld a gentleman of middle height
and middle age, balancing himself with some
difficulty on the churchyard wall. He was</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"A noticeable man, with great grey eyes,"</p>

</div>

<p>and his forehead looked like an ivory dome
for genius to inhabit.</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet a denizen of earth on

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

this planet," he said, "That is a fine spire.
I forget their Mars measure, but it is about
a thousand feet high, so far as I can make
out. And the trees are higher! They go
in for the material sublime in this vagrant
red-tinged island of the sky."</p>

<p>"Have you been long here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Long?" he said, with a gesture much
like surprise in those seldom perturbable
eyes. "Long? Well, it may be a century,
and it may be an hour. I have given up
time. I have taken to eternity for a change.
It suits me."</p>

<p>"I find myself in Mars," I said, "with no
particular idea as to what I ought to do, and
with no notion in the world how long I am
to remain here. What would you advise me
to do?"</p>

<p>"I advise! I thank Apollo Eka&euml;rgos
I never advised man or woman in my life,
and when boy or girl wants advice I whip

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

it. My dear earth-brother, you are in Mars&mdash;accept
Mars&mdash;take everything easily. I
have tried several of our planets, and this is
the best I know. They are too philosophical
in Jupiter, and too fast in Venus. Mars is
one of the few planets where they really understand
life. Shall we travel together? I
want to make a descriptive account of the
planet, which I dare say Longman or
Murray would publish when I return to
earth."</p>

<p>I agreed, only too happy to meet an
earth-denizen who was evidently a man of
genius. Somewhere or other I had seen his
likeness, but where? I knew I ought to
know him. I did not like to ask a man his
name, when he might have left it behind him
with his skin.</p>

<p>"There is a fine altar-piece in this church,"
he said. "Will you look at it? The Mars
people are not quite equal to us&mdash;they paint

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

well enough, but they can't produce poetry.
Still I like them. They have not yet invented
the Radical."</p>

<p>"I never had much to do with politics," I
remarked, "and scarcely know a Radical
from any other sort of fool. Mine is rather
a vague notion of such matters; but in the
days when I was an Englishman, I was loyal
to the King, in my own uninstructed way."</p>

<p>My acquaintance rocked himself backwards
and forwards on the wall, looking
ridiculously like an owl. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"Come, let us see this fresco."</p>

<p>I went with him. It was a grand painting&mdash;two
men and a dog&mdash;nothing more. But
one of those men was Odysseus, and the
dog was Argos. I looked at my companion
with surprise. I had expected something
perfectly and patently orthodox. He explained
to me that Homer was the bible of
the planet Mars.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

<p>"How can that be?" I asked. "How in
the world did Homer migrate here?"</p>

<p>"How did you and I get here, my friend?
It has been coolly asserted that, at the time
of the siege of Troy, Homer was a camel in
Bactria. That I deny. The soul of man
never passes into any lower creature; the
soul of that supreme man we call the poet,
never passes even into the lower ranks of
men, A poet is as high above a man, as a
man above a dog; and as to Homer, why, he
came here as we came. He had in his
memory his great epic the <i>Iliad</i>, his great
romance the <i>Odyssey</i>. He translated them
instinctively into the language of Mars.
Mars accepted his legends, his theology, his
ethics, and I think Mars was right. If you
must have a multitude of gods, the Homeric
gods are the best. I believe in one only&mdash;<i>whom
I know</i>."</p>

<p>These last words he uttered with a deep

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

gravity, as if to cling to the idea of God was
the central thought in his mind; and thus
indeed I found it when we became friends.
It was one delight&mdash;the conscious feeling of
a present God. It saved him from all
cynicism, from all dissatisfaction. The song
of a bird, the beauty of a sunset, the laugh
of a girl, were all divine gifts to him&mdash;he
intensified the enjoyment of life by always
remembering the Giver of that enjoyment.
Pen, ink, and paper fail to make what I
mean intelligible. You could not be in
that man's company without feeling that he
was never alone.</p>

<p>The Homeric fresco was fine. There
walked Odysseus, disguised by the power of
the goddess who guided him, but grand in
his disguise. Royal was his bare throat,
a pillar of power; wide his stately chest;
and as he stood, his strong hands reached to
his knees. The honest swineherd looked a

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

dwarf beside him. Huge Argo, aged and
deaf, blinking wearily by the palace gate,
was suddenly alive again at his master's
tread&mdash;alive a moment, and then dead for
ever. The painter had caught the poet's
vision perfectly.</p>

<p>"We must come to this church some
day," said my companion. "There is rather
a fine preacher. I also have preached, but
usually with the effect of driving my congregation
gradually away."</p>

<p>"You are a poet," I said. "Poets should
not preach."</p>

<p>"We'll go farther than that. Poets
should write no poetry. They may think
it, they may whisper it to the lady they
love, they may even recite it to a great
audience, when poetry can breed a passion
of war, but write it&mdash;never! No, poetry is
spoilt by being formulated. It is a world&mdash;the
common poetaster would make it a map!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

<p>We passed out of the church, and walked
up a lovely slope of emerald green, which
gave a charming view of the lake below.
We sat on an ancient boulder of granite,
and looked down upon the lake, alive with
sails, and the trees mysteriously hiding
quaint corners of wilful water. We heard
light laughter. Mars was merry.</p>

<p>"There is no sea on this planet," said my
companion. "I think that an admirable
arrangement. There are plenty of pleasant
lakes, fed by rivulets and from the hills;
but sea there is none. And you have yet to
discover the fortunate power of the water
of Mars."</p>

<p>"What is that?" I said.</p>

<p>"Come, we will climb to the summit of
this hill&mdash;there is a spring there&mdash;you shall
try it."</p>

<p>It was rather hard work, the hill being
about the height of Coniston Old Man, and

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

very like it. Quite at the top there was a
quaint well, with an arch of stone over it,
and maidenhair fern fluttering around.</p>

<p>"Make a cup of thy palm and drink,"
said my companion.</p>

<p>I obeyed. I was strangely refreshed.
The water had the perfect pure taste of
water&mdash;the most delicious of all liquid
tastes&mdash;but it had also the power of a noble
wine.</p>

<p>"Ah!" quoth my companion, "now you
know. 'Tis the famous gas of Mars, the
element unknown to our poor planet.
Pyrogen blends with oxygen and hydrogen,
producing a water that is superior to any
wine I have ever tasted&mdash;and I have tried
several varieties on several planets."</p>

<p>I took another draught&mdash;and liked it.
There is no fluid so enjoyable as water.
Water with pyrogen in it <i>is</i>&mdash;well, it is a

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

drink to ruin la Veuve Clicquot, and the
Marquis de Lur Saluces.</p>

<p>"I am of opinion," proceeded my companion,
always looking very wise, but with a
touch of humour about his mouth that was delightful,
"that water of this kind would be
uncommonly useful on our poor old pauper
planet Earth, where people drink very
bad beer. Although not particularly fond
of my fellow-creatures, I should like to give
them something not wholly poisoned to
drink; but I see no way&mdash;I really see no way,
so I suppose you and I had better drink when
thirsty at these wayside-wells, and be thankful
that there is such a gas as pyrogen."</p>

<p>I admitted my thankfulness. Indeed, the
waters of Mars are treasures unutterable.
Not all, as I think, are equally strong; but
all have a delicious healthful stimulus, without
departure from the taste of water in
absolute purity. The result is not to be

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

described. No man in the world with a
palate would prefer the finest wine in the
whole catalogue of vintages to water, if
water could only give him that intellectual
stimulus he needs. This is given by the
water of Mars.</p>

<p>"I think I shall call you Mark Antony,"
said my companion, abruptly. "You remind
me of him in many respects. Yes, it
is a good name&mdash;it is separable; you can be
Mark sometimes&mdash;Antony on great occasions."</p>

<p>"And what shall I call you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Ἕστησε</i>. 'Tis Punic Greek for 'he hath
stood.' Stood I have, in days now past,
against the armies of fools, idiots, braggarts,
blockheads. It was no easy matter, Mark.
The very men who learnt from me professed
to laugh at me. They deemed themselves
wiser than I, because, catching up a stray
idea of mine, they could make it more

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

intelligible to the public than I could.
<i>They</i>, with their one small stolen idea! Of
course, they could explain it. <i>My</i> difficulty
was that I had too many ideas. So only
the men who think know what I did for the
world; and I often wonder whether I shall
have better fortune in my next avatar. It
will come soon, I suppose."</p>

<p>I began to understand to whom I was
listening. Listening was a necessity, but a
very delightful necessity, when <i>Ἕστησε</i>
talked. We were ascending the hill as we
thus conversed, and on its very summit was
a curious old ruin. I had not (indeed I have
not now) any scientific knowledge of the
arch&aelig;ology of Mars; but it was the sort of
antique edifice that, in the England of today,
would be ascribed to the Romans.
There was an ancient column, with circles
carved on the capital, and all covered with
an orange lichen.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i> leaned awhile against this quaint
old relic of the past. Then he suddenly
said,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">                "Nos tristia vitae
Solamur cantu."</p>

</div>

<p>"There need be nothing very sad in this
pleasant planet," I replied.</p>

<p>What said he?</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Ah! is not memory sad, my friend,
And thought of that sweet youthful time,
When life was love, when love was life,
    When not to love was crime?</p>

<p class="stanza">"I sang my sweet a song so sad.
She came into my arms to say,
'O darling, such another tale
    Please tell another day.'</p>

<p class="stanza">"Her beautiful bright eyes had tears
Within them&mdash;diamonds, sapphire-drowned&mdash;
Her white arms trembled as they stretched
    My willing waist around.</p>

<p class="stanza">"I said, 'My own sweet Genevieve,
I'll tell you tales by day and night,
And some shall be of love's despair.
    And some of love's delight.</p>

<p class="stanza">" 'I'll sing you songs to make you laugh,
And sadder songs to make you weep.
Songs sweet as after sunshine rain.
    As kisses after sleep.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

<p class="stanza">" 'Songs also like the clarion-blast
Of England, ready for the fight;
But which would you like best by day,
    And which like best by night?'</p>

<p class="stanza">"She laughed a merry little laugh.
My Genevieve&mdash;a joyous sprite;
She said, 'O sing of love at noon.
    And sing of love at night.' "</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"He holds him with his glittering eye."</p>

</div>

<p>"MARK ANTONY," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "let
us sleep to-night at the Ghost and
Gridiron. Several times have I visited that
inn, and I have come to the belief that its
gridiron is more real than its ghost. No
ghost have I seen; but rump-steak have I
eaten that could by no means have been
cooked except on a gridiron. When I was
on earth I have more than once dined with
the Sublime Society of steak-eaters, and had
my slice of ox cooked by a Royal Duke, and

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

served by a Knight of the Garter. <i>Honi
soit qui mal y pense</i>. Let the man blush who
thinks rump-steak and oysters beneath the
dignity of princes and poets."</p>

<p>We were skirting the lovely margin of the
lake on our way to the Ghost and Gridiron.
The loftiest oaks and cedars that I had ever
seen overshadowed this beautiful piece of
water; but for all that, and though sunset
was almost past, so translucent was the lake
that you could see the fish in its depths.
<i>Ἕστησε</i> would put his long white hand in
the water; lo, a fish would come at once to
greet it, acknowledging some strange magnetic
mastery in the man. The birds sang
more sweetly as he passed beneath the trees.
The very weather smiled on him. His faith
in the kindness of God had perpetual
reward.</p>

<p>"Why do you link together prince and
poet?" I asked, as we stood awhile watching

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

a white bat that rushed from the hills
above into the quiet lake. "What connection
can there be between them?"</p>

<p>"How often, I wonder, during the next
few centuries, shall I be asked this question?
The prince, of course, represented the prose
of the world. His early ancestors, who
founded his family, was a poet, depend on
it. Look what poetic power there was in
Alfred .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Edward the First, when he
commissioned Peter l'Imagineur to build
those crosses to Eleanor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ay, and even
in Charles the Second, when he swam with
that peasant on his back, and made love to
the blacksmith's wife, as he was out wood-cutting
with Penderel. In a line of princes
there will be fools; but their inception is
poetic, and poetic also is their correlation to
the people they rule. The king <i>is</i> the
nation. When a nation comes to its worst
and kills its king, as in the cases of England

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

and France, you have in truth a national
suicide. It is not the prince merely who is
to blame, it is the whole people. To kill a
king is national suicide; to compel him to
abdicate is national lunacy. The worst
hereditary monarch that ever reigned is
better than the best elected ruler or usurper.
Experience shows these things; but it takes
long time to teach the ordinary unornamental
but careful biped."</p>

<p>"Almost as long as it takes to teach him
to love poetry," I said.</p>

<p>"Almost. There are few things that so
perplex the commonalty as the connection
between poetry and politics. Yet has poetry
no reason to exist, except when connected
with politics; for one is the vision of
life as it is, and the other is the vision
of life as we desire it to be. Therefore
is it that no man is worthy to be considered
as a politician who is incapable of

<!-- vol 2 page 36 -->

understanding the poetry of his race and
country."</p>

<p>We reached the Ghost and Gridiron, and
the disinterested landlord was evidently very
glad to see us again. <i>Ἕστησε</i> had been
here more than once previously. He had
indeed, <i>ore rotundo</i>, remonstrated with the
landlord in regard to the sign of his inn,
maintaining that, with such a name, a ghost is
as requisite as a gridiron. Alas, there was
no ghost.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful night, I remember.
The world was calm; the beauty of the sky
was unutterable, for the rich glow of pyrogen
in the atmosphere made it seem as if
the stars were visible through a soft haze of
ruby. <i>Ἕστησε</i> and I fared sumptuously, and
enjoyed ourselves. We strolled after supper
into the garden of the Ghost and Gridiron.
Nothing had we drunken save water,
but water of Mars made us joyous and full

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

of life. How the stars rained influence upon
us!</p>

<p>"I want an adventure," I said, as we
walked across the soft lawn.</p>

<p>There was a nightingale singing wildly.
I pined to fight or to love&mdash;preferably both.
Another nightingale broke into song; then
suddenly more and more.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Ah! never elsewhere in one place I knew
So many nightingales,"</p>

</div>

<p>said my companion. "And do you know
the omen? Wherever there is a nightingale
there is a possible adventure."</p>

<p>"You mean that?" I said&mdash;"or is it an
invention of the moment?"</p>

<p>"It is true. Where the nightingale sings,
there love loiters. Love is loitering here,
depend on it, awaiting his opportunity.
You want an adventure: I do not. Alas!
I have had only too many!"</p>

<p>As my comrade spoke, I could see a

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

radiant light in his marvellous eyes. He
seemed to remember past events in our old
planet somewhat wistfully.</p>

<p>"<i>Ἄυριον ἄδιον ἄσω</i>," he said.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Who once has heard the nightingale
    Sing love-songs in the night,
Shall evermore on sea or shore
    Sigh for sweet love's delight.</p>

<p class="stanza">"That song is clear, and every year
    Frets the fair summer tide;
It rings full plain where lime-sheaths rain
    And lilac-blooms abide.</p>

<p class="stanza">"And he who hath heard that brown-eyed bird,
    When stars climb heaven's blue steep.
Ere the next star dips, let him kiss fair lips,
    Else shall he never sleep."</p>

</div>

<p>Thus did <i>Ἕστησε</i> improvise. I laughed
at his humours.</p>

<p>"Nightingales may sing," I said, "and
glad am I to hear them; but their song will
scarcely conjure up kissable lips in the
vicinage of the Ghost and Gridiron. No;
there is no adventure to-night, I fear."</p>

<p>"Unbeliever!" he said. "Adventure is

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

tremulous in the air. I can feel its electric
menace and monition. You, who profess
to pine for it, cannot apprehend its coming.
Listen."</p>

<p>There was a shrill voice of alarm&mdash;a
woman's voice. By the starlight (Mars,
unhappily for its poets, being moonless) we
discerned a female form. We heard harsh
sounds in Celtic brogue behind; an ungraceful
monster of a man followed the
flying demoiselle, using strong language,
wherein Irish and Latin seemed to mingle.
I caught and collared him as he passed.
He collapsed, and I restored him to consciousness
with a mild kick. Meanwhile,
<i>Ἕστησε</i> had consoled the lady, who turned
out to be exquisitely pretty and transcendently
clever.</p>

<p>"They christened me by a name which
means joy," she said, when her enemy had
departed, and she was safe under our care.

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

"Alas! there must have been something
unfortunate in that baptism, for sorrow has
been my most unchanging fate. Imagine
my being accosted and persecuted in this
planet by that dreadful man who worried
me on earth!"</p>

<p>Her voice had a sob in it.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself, Lady of Joy,"
said <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "Develop your own natural
character. That dreadful man will not come
near you again, for fear of my friend Mark
Antony's valiant boots. That dreadful man
deserves some excuse, my child; for who
could hear you sing and not love you? But
forget him; you are safe. I will be your
chaperon. My young friend, Mark Antony,
will make himself agreeable to you. Mark,
did I not tell thee there was magic in the
nightingale's note?"</p>

<p>"What magic?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"O, Mars is all magic," answered <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"The brown bird slugs, the cool air rings,
    And Echo answers sweet.
And young feet rush, and young cheeks flush.
    And young lips murmur and meet."</p>

</div>

<p>With such encouragement, could I do
less than kiss the lips of the improvisatrice,
lady of joy? I don't know whether I could,
but I did not.</p>

<p>"Now," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "let us come to an
agreement. Here we are, three ancient
dwellers upon earth, who have come into
residence on the planet Mars. Of myself
there is no necessity for anything to be said.
My step-dame planet will find me out in
time. Of the lady whom they christened
Joy, there is this delightful thought, that if
her life had many sorrows, it gave to others
many joys. As to you, Mark Antony, answer
for yourself. <i>I</i> know your history well, for
I read your character, and character is the
root of history. You have been a fortunate
fool. If you pass through the ordeal of

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

this planet wisely, you will lose your folly,
and retain your fortune. Now is your
chance&mdash;perhaps it is my chance, too&mdash;perhaps
it is Joy's. Let us travel together.
Let us look for other earth-dwellers, of
whom many are wandering about Mars.
Let us explore the planet, picking up any
comrades we may find."</p>

<p>I agreed. Joy agreed. We went back
to the inn, to make our arrangements for
the night. They were difficult at first sight,
and would on earth have been full of very
delicate considerations; but when you have
been stripped of your suit of flesh, and
passed on to another sphere, you reject trivial
matters. The portly and hospitable landlord
informed us that he had but one
vacant bedchamber, that it contained four
beds, that we were welcome to three of
them, but that the fourth was always kept
vacant for a guest of curious habits, who

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

usually made his appearance at midnight.</p>

<p>I turned to <i>Ἕστησε</i> inquiringly. He
laughed a quaint little laugh, and looked
merrily at Joy, who blushed about as much
as the tinge at the core of a maiden-blush
rose.</p>

<p>"What say you, Miss Joy?" he asked.</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>"Absurd traditions of earth cling around
you," he said. "I am not surprised. It is
the same with me. I am always expecting
to see a book or a newspaper; and the
Mars people have very wisely declined to
invent the art of printing yet. I am
always expecting to feel very ill, and
have to call in a doctor; but in Mars the
smell of a flower is the only medicine known.
The rose infallibly cures rheumatism; smell
a lily, and you shall never again be fool
enough to think yourself a poet. The mimosa
pudica, shrinking from the very look

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

of humanity, is the best medicine in the
world for naughty girls. A grain of it would
have cured Juliet&mdash;indeed, a grain of it
would have robbed Eve of that curiosity
which some people deplore. I don't. Women
ought to be inquisitive. If I had my
way, all the Post Offices should be kept by
post-mistresses; they would do such an immense
deal of good, by stealthily reading all
the letters, and communicating their contents
to other people. But I am thinking of Earth;
the folk of Mars don't seem to have a grain
of curiosity in their composition. It is the
one great fault of this pleasant planet."</p>

<p>"You seriously think it a fault?" I said.</p>

<p>"I fancy so; if you look at the matter
philosophically, curiosity is at the basis of
all the sciences. The astronomer's desire to
know how far the sun is from the earth is
closely akin to the gossip's desire to know who
was the father of her neighbour's illegitimate

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

child. Here in Mars they ask no questions.
The note of interrogation is unknown in their
punctuative system, if they have any such
system. It saves a deal of lying, of course,
for, when people persist in asking questions,
you naturally invent answers. But I think
it decreases scientific research. If you observe,
these Mars people have not yet invented
newspapers or factories or mines or lawyers
or hotel bills. Isn't it sad? The depth
of their ignorance is really tragic. It is
shown by our immediate difficulty. Imagine
their expecting a lady to sleep in a quadruple-bedded
room!"</p>

<p>"Do you talk in your sleep, Mr. <i>Ἕστησε</i>?"
asked Joy, humorously.</p>

<p>"I <i>always</i> talk," he replied. "You will
hear my voice all through the midnight
murmuring musically. You will hear</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"A noise like of a hidden brook,
    In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
    Singeth a quiet tune."</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

<p>"What a charming prospect!" said Joy,
laughingly, to me. "What will be the report
to-morrow morning? Shall we have
'drunken deep of all the blessedness of
sleep?' I sadly fear not."</p>

<p>Joy accepting the situation, we took appropriate
refreshment, and went upstairs.
The landlord guided us. The room was a very
large one, almost square, with a bed in each
corner, curtained in with adequate decorum.
One of these beds, with a green coverlet,
was reserved for the mysterious gentleman
who had the habit of turning up at midnight.</p>

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i> took three or four turns up and
down the room, walked to one of the windows,
and expressed in strong language his
disgust that Mars had no moon, then found
his way into bed with exemplary rapidity.</p>

<p>Joy, who was at the opposite corner to
mine, diagonally, knelt down in the smallest
possible amount of linen, and said her

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

prayers. Then she disappeared amid the
lavender-scented sheets.</p>

<p>I could not sleep. I tried all possible
experiments. I endeavoured, with closed
eyes, to imagine my own breath. I counted
myriads of sheep passing slowly up a sheep-walk.
I followed the movements of that
snail that climbed five feet up a wall every
day, and slid back four feet every night. I
set myself to extract square roots. I discovered
the exact instant at which the hands
of one's watch (if one had not forgotten to
wind it up) would coincide between one and
two. I calculated the duration of the box-woods
of the British Isles, on the assumption
that every curate plays croquet for a
year before he finds a wife, and was amused
to discover that the time was exactly the
same as that Mr. Gladstone fixed for disestablishing
the Church. I made poetry.
Even that did not cause me to sleep.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

<p>Confound it! And there was <i>Ἕστησε</i>
snoring tremendously in his corner, while
Joy's pretty nostrils emitted what might be
described as an unconscious lyrical effusion.
Why can't I sleep also?</p>

<p>Has it ever happened to you, gentle
reader, to be sleepy when you desired to be
sleepless, or sleepless when you desired to
be sleepy? Both are irritating. I often
write in my sleep, and, when I see the nonsense
I have written, wonder if it may contain
some hidden meaning, like the dreams
of Nebuchadnezzar. Often again I cannot
sleep; the brain lamp burns too clearly, and
will not let itself be puffed out by any effort
of will. This night I was only too lucidly
awake, while my friends were enjoying
slumbers which I heartily envied.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of our chamber opened.
The landlord appeared in the dishabille
that one expects of a landlord at midnight.

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

With him came the vagrant guest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a boy
almost, a boy that might pass for a girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
with long light hair and a tremulous, excited
face, and wild eyes. "Androgynos," I
thought.</p>

<p>There was soon silence. Incurious, the
new-comer threw himself on his bed without
undressing. But I heard him say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O silent stars, that gaze on Mars!
    O liquid wells of living light!
When ends my day of storm and strife?
    When comes my night of love and life?
When comes good night?"</p>

</div>

<p>This settled me. I fell asleep, and dreamt
I was the man who built Stonehenge.</p>

<hr/>

<p>YES, I slept. If anyone asked me at
what time I awoke, I can only say
that I have not the remotest idea. After
first dreaming that I was building Stonehenge
with large blocks of stone brought in
balloons from the Pyramids of Egypt&mdash;and
next, that I was Ares caught in a magic
golden net of Hephaistos&mdash;and next, that I
was back at Five Tree Hill, with Mavis Lee
by my side, where the rivulet ripples by
Saint Apollonia's Chapel, I fell into that

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

profound and dreamless sleep which, annihilating
thought, annihilates trouble and
care likewise. That night I dreamt no
more.</p>

<p>When at length I did awake, slowly and
calmly, with a feeling of perfect refreshment,
I found the sun high, and the room
vacant. Joy had fled; so had the androgynous
lover of midnight; so had <i>Ἕστησε</i>.
I cared nothing; I was heartily thankful to
them for not awaking me. The air was
warm; I resolved to commence the day
with a swim in the lake near by.</p>

<p>Under a noble cedar a pair-oar was
moored. I got into it and rowed into deep
water. Then, undressing, I took a header
into the lake, deriving as I dived marvellous
refreshment and stimulus from the
pyrogen of the water of Mars. What surprised
me most was that, the specific gravity
of the water being much less than that of

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

our terrene fluid, I went far deeper down
with my first impulse. Strange to say, I
could remain below without inconvenience.
An eminent chemist has suggested to me
that the pyrogen in Mars water is not
chemically, but mechanically mixed with it,
and is sufficiently liberated to make breathing
enjoyable. I don't know about this;
I do know that I breathed as easily under
water as above it.</p>

<p>Having, like Lyndhurst, given up being
amazed at anything, I took with coolness
my arrival at what was clearly the entrance
to a subaqueous city. Two lofty columns
of porphyry bore a cross-piece of polished
granite, and, between them, great gates of
malachite stood open wide. I hesitated
whether to enter or not. The gate had no
guardian. The wide sea-street seemed to
pass between a mile of palaces. Much I
wondered whether indeed this was some

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

drowned city of long-past times, or whether
it really had inhabitants.</p>

<p>I was not long left doubtful. There
emerged from one of the great buildings
near me a little man, with no attire except
a pair of spectacles. He greeted me with
whimsical deference, and bade me welcome
to the city of gems. He had in his hand a
huge ruby, cut <i>en cabochon</i>, which he seemed
to have just been manipulating with a delicate
tool of steel.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "we amuse ourselves
with the study of colour. We build
palaces of diamonds. We shave sapphire
thin as a butterfly's wing. We catch insects
and fishes in amber. We ignite pyrogen
with the hidden heat of the carbuncle.
Look!"</p>

<p>He made a movement, and a stream of
ruddy light ran right up to the surface of the
water. Then he beckoned me to follow

<!-- vol 2 page 54 -->

him. We entered a wide saloon, all of
porphyry, where, on a table of white marble,
lay the most magnificent gems I ever
beheld till then.</p>

<p>"You are from another planet," he said,
"where they cannot live under water or
cut gems like these. We get many such
visitors. Here is a memento for you."</p>

<p>He took from the table an armlet of
platinum; the soldiers of Rome wore such
armlets in gold and silver, for use as well
as adornment. On this band of platinum
was a circular drop of amber, about two
inches in diameter: within it, with wings
widespread, was a large butterfly, red as to
the head, green in body, with wings of
blue sapphire sprinkled with dots of dazzling
gold. Around the great amber drop was
a circle of dark emeralds, the colour of deep
sea water, set in thin rings of virgin-gold.</p>

<p>"Take this," he said, "O son of a strange

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

planet! Wear it while you are here."</p>

<p>He clasped it on my right wrist.</p>

<p>"One word more. Visit the island in
the middle of the lake. There you will see
my daughter. This armlet will cause you
to be recognised. Farewell."</p>

<p>It was so clear a case of abrupt dismissal
that I walked back through the
malachite gateway, and at once sought the
upper air. As I rose toward the surface, I
caught a glimpse of the little man, with
spectacles on nose, intensely watching me.
I had never seen so comical a figure.</p>

<p>I swam to my boat. Having given up
being surprised at anything, I was not surprised
to find <i>Ἕστησε</i> in my boat.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "I thought you were not
drowned. I got the ferry lass to take me
to your boat, which, by the way, I suppose is
borrowed or stolen. It's a good custom
they have here, to put pretty girls in charge

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

of ferries. That's a fine armlet: Pha&euml;ton's
sisters must have been very lachrymose the
day they drowned that splendid papilio in
their electric tears. It has perhaps not
occurred to you that the Pha&euml;ton legend
and the liquid electrum were merely the
Greek poetic way of dealing with science.
Homer knew quite as much of electricity as
my dear old friend Sir Humphrey Davy.
By the way, I think he is here, fishing."</p>

<p>"Where are our friends of last night?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"O, I don't know. Joy got up in a
sorrowful state, and gushed away in tears.
Extremes meet. The Man of Midnight was
off at sunrise. I left you happily asleep,
got a glass of milk, and wandered a few
miles away. Returning, I beheld your
vagrant bark. I was reminded of an adventure
of mine on another planet. I never
could ride, and so of course I delighted in

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

riding. I never could swim; equally of
course I loved swimming. On a short tour I
had hired a horse of the most contrary and
cantankerous character, and found myself
one day on the margin of a pleasant lake.
It was hot. I resolved on a dip. I tied my
rampant Rosinante to a tree, undressed, and
did my best to daringly drown myself. I
might have done so, but that I heard a clatter
of hoofs. Rosinante had escaped! I started
in hot pursuit, deeming myself safe in that
lovely place. When thoroughly out of breath,
I managed to capture the animal, a mile off
from my clothes. I mounted it, and rode
back. Imagine&mdash;no, you cannot imagine&mdash;my
horror at seeing a party of ladies carefully
examining my apparel, evidently of
opinion that it belonged to a drowned man.
There they were&mdash;a female jury, waiting for
the coroner."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" I asked, laughing.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

<p>All this time I was pulling toward the island,
and he was professedly steering, which he
did by pulling the rope fiercely with the
hand that at the moment happened to be
most excited. We zig-zagged greatly.</p>

<p>"What did I do? Well, there were about
a dozen of them, and they were so curiously
examining my raiment, and reading my
letters and other nonsense, that they heard
not on the heather the hoofs of my vagabond
steed. So I forced the villain into
the lake, and they heard the splash, and
beheld a nude rider on a nude horse, and
fled with headlong precipitation. I got ashore
again, not at all sorry; but I believe they
had run away with some of my love-letters."</p>

<p>We ran at this moment into a lovely little
bay, so full of white water-lily, that it was
hard to pull the boat through. We got
ashore. <i>Ἕστησε</i> said:</p>

<p>"Of course you have not breakfasted."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I have had nothing but a glass of milk.
I know nothing of this island, but as a rule
all Mars is right hospitable. Let us start
in search of food."</p>

<p>There was a city in the distance shining
in the radiant air, built apparently somewhat
like the city beneath the mere. Before we
reached it, however, we came to a pretty
cottage, such as you might see in England
itself: lawn in front, roses and honeysuckles
and wistaria covering the walls, and peeping
in at the windows in friendly fashion. There
was a wicket gate, that seemed to invite the
hand. There was not only fragrance of lavender,
there were bee-hives. The smallest of
white dogs basked in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"That distant city looks superb," said
<i>Ἕστησε</i>, pausing at the wicket gate; "but
it is distant, and the cottage is near. Besides,
no wise man ever yet entered a city who

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

could find shelter in a cottage. I doubt
whether any cottage was ever more hospitable
than this. Let us lift the friendly latch."</p>

<p>He did, and the little white dog rushed
wildly down the path, with more barks than
any other dog could have ejaculated in the
time, and flew frantically at <i>Ἕστησε</i>'s legs, and
tore with its sharp little teeth a fragment
from his pantaloons. Rushed after the little
dog a little girl of thirteen or fourteen, who
picked it up, and made a curtsey, and led
the way to the door.</p>

<p>Behold a vision! A tall lithe yet lazy-looking
girl with very thick bright brown
curly hair, kept short, and a straight Greek
nose, and a merry mouth, and eyes whose
colour no one could possibly state, they
changed so often. They were never one
colour right through. I have seen them a soft
brown, with scintillating flashes of sapphire;
I have seen them a blue-black, with dots of

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

gold in them, like the gold leaf in <i>acqua d'oro</i>.
She was standing now just within the rustic
porch, where the fragrance of honeysuckle
was almost painfully delicious. She looked
at us both keenly but briefly, and when she
noticed my wonderful armlet of amber, she
said:</p>

<p>"Ah, you have seen my father. He is
well, of course; he never was otherwise."</p>

<p>"Young lady." said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, without giving
me a chance of reply, "we are hungry and
athirst. We want that vulgar meal known
as breakfast. That being consumed, we shall
be in a condition to admire your beauty and
listen to your pleasant prattle."</p>

<p>The girl broke into a gay laugh, like the
silver splash of a water force in the land of
the western moors.</p>

<p>"Breakfast you shall have," she said.
"Ph&oelig;be, small but useful handmaiden,
make coffee. Ph&oelig;be can, I assure you,

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

make coffee, though she has been ignominiously
punished for lamentable ignorance of
her multiplication-table."</p>

<p>It was a light bow-windowed room. On
the table were soon spread delicate cold
meats, cream cheese, salad of many sorts.
There were wines, also, beside the coffee;
and there was that best of all fluids, the
water of Mars. We breakfasted with energy
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Alouette!" said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>WE did justice to our pleasant entertainment,
provided for strangers with
such marvellous kindness and good-humour;
but I was growing used to Mars, and as to
<i>Ἕστησε</i>, he took everything as calmly as he
had been wont to do in quite another planet.
When we had got through our breakfast,
the lady our hostess asked if we would
smoke on the lawn.</p>

<p>"Smoke!" said my companion, "it would

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

be shameful amid this perfect flower fragrance."</p>

<p>"Try!" she rejoined, and deftly made him
a cigarette of something which certainly was
not tobacco. Another also she gave to me.
As I smoked it I felt a strange quietude
come over me. It was not narcotic, it was
supremely tranquil.</p>

<p>"We find something new every day on
the surface of this planet," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.
"This, lady fair, is fresh to me. What is it?"</p>

<p>"The Lost Rose of Troy," she said.
"When that city fell, every plant on the
borders of Simo&iuml;s and Scamander perished.
But Odysseus had taken some seeds, which
he gave to Nausicaa; and Nausicaa brought
them here, where the flowers flourish abundantly.
<i>Perdita Troiae Rosa</i> the learned
people call it. Every part of it is useful.
The smell of the flower cures all maladies,
restores the memory, quickens the imagination.

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

The berries ripen seldom: but if you
can obtain a ripe berry it will make you invisible
by holding it in the palm of your
hand. The petals produce a more delicious
and stimulant wine than that which Christabel
gave to Geraldine."</p>

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i> laughed.</p>

<p>"We will settle down, Mark Antony," he
said. "We will become nursery gardeners
and grow the <i>Rosa Perdita</i>. Is there a
Covent Garden, my child, in that distant
city?"</p>

<p>But the girl had run away while he was
talking, and we were alone. My companion
smoked placidly. <i>Rosa Perdita</i> beats tobacco.</p>

<p>"I wonder what is the name of that noble
city," he said presently. "I have dreamt of
it. I wrote of it when I was a boy on earth.
Let me remember.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Across the wide plain, many miles away,
There is a calm and stately City. Lo!
Its towers and arches underneath the ray
Of the great Sun are smitten into snow.
One tower of marble, with a roseate glow,
Square, and yet light of build, dwarfs all the rest.
It seems to rise a thousand feet or so;
Its lordly loveliness is manifest.
Ay, we will visit thee, fair City in the West.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"Our hostess will tell us," I said.</p>

<p>"Call her Alouette. All women are
birds. I made that discovery in another
planet. She is a lark. She does not look
before and after, or pine for what is not.
She sends her spontaneous cry of delight to
the summit of the sky. Yes, women are
birds. I have known one or two owls .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and O dear me, how many parrots! They
are scientific, critical, heterodox .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the female
atheist that talks you dead."</p>

<p>"What is the little waiting-maid?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"A wren," he replied. "Certes, sir, as

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

they say in the <i>Mort Arthur</i>, I wish either
lark or wren would come this way. <i>Rosa
Perdita</i> has a noble flavour. I wonder are
there any ripe berries to be found?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be the wren suddenly came near,
singing forgetfully. She stopped with a
blush. Snow, the little dog, was barking
gaily at her heels. She was one of those
children that seem innocently soulless; they
are fresh and facile and flower-like.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>The question was instantly answered. We
saw Alouette coming down the garden path
in a gay fashion, with more cigarettes on a
silver tray, and glasses of the <i>Rosa Perdita</i>
wine. She moved so easily that I thought
there was something in my friend's bird theory.
It seemed as if she might have
flown into the air; and really, as we met
her father at the bottom of a lake, we could
not have been surprised at anything of the

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

kind. She might have flown away into the
illimitable ether, without thoroughly astonishing
us.</p>

<p>"More cigarettes, more wine," she said,
placing her tray on the rustic table near
us.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you like the Lost Rose;
tell me what you think of the wine. Is it
not better than Christabel's?"</p>

<p>"It is, I must say, marvellously good,"
said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, looking curiously at the liquid
as it glanced in his glass. It was of a dark
amber colour, but almost effervescent; the
glasses containing it were amazingly thin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
thin as the wing of a wasp .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.white, but
with a streak of crimson running irregularly
and capriciously through them. "I like
this liquid," he continued. "<i>Rosa Perdita</i>
beats heather as a basis for wine."</p>

<p>"I made it, you know," said Alouette,
"and I am the best maker in Mars."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

"Ha!" quoth <i>Ἕστησε</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"There's not a girl in the best of the stars
That round the royal Sun goes
Who can make such wine as our Lady of Mars
Makes from the Lost Troy Rose."</p>

</div>

<p>"What is that lovely city in the distance?"
I said to Alouette.</p>

<p>"Troy."</p>

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i> sprang to his feet, and his glorious
eyes were filled with a vivid light.</p>

<p>"I remember the vision of my boyhood,"
he cried. "Yes, that <i>is</i> Troy, and I shall
see Helen and Andromache. Do you know
what it is, Mark Antony? Here in Mars
the glorious things rejected on earth are
preserved immortally. We must go to Troy.
Will you come, Alouette?"</p>

<p>"Will I leave you?" she said. "Am I
likely again to meet with such charming
strangers? Depend on me as your companion
till you are tired of me."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

<p>"We accept," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "I answer
for Mark Antony as for myself. We are both
your friends and servants."</p>

<p>Such is Mars. A planet of discontinuity
and caprice. Here on earth the French tell
us that nothing is certain but the unforeseen.
The apophthegm applies to Mars more
accurately. Where (even in France) will
you find a young lady like Alouette?</p>

<p>Off we all walked toward Troy, little
Snow being of the company, and barking
with a wild garrulity of joy. Ph&oelig;be the
wren bowed over the wicket-gate, and cried
a little because she wasn't allowed to go.
Then she went indoors and played with a
kitten and a doll, and ate several jam-tarts.</p>

<p>The great gates of the city stood before
us. A myriad horsemen could easily have
come upon an enemy through those mighty
and majestic portals. "Yes," I thought.

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

"this is the Troy of my boyhood, when all
the futile fuss about syntax and dialect did
not prevent me from perceiving the presence
of a supreme poet. Yes, this is wide-streeted
windy Troy. Now I shall see Helen
and Andromache. Now I shall see Cassandra,
whom Apollo deigned to love. Priam will
grant me an audience; Hector will give me
a smile; Paris will invite me to dinner."</p>

<p>I said some of these things to <i>Ἕστησε</i>.
He smiled.</p>

<p>"You may meet Homer here," he said;
"if so, 'twill be better fortune than encountering
all the swells at Queen Hecuba's
drawing-room."</p>

<p>In the very centre of Troy, just below
the enormous tower of the temple dedicated
to Apollo, there is a very pleasant club,
wherein ladies and gentlemen meet. London
had such clubs once, but these dull decorous
days have made Saint James's Street too

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

saintly. The Troy Tory Club (anagrammatic,
you observe) admitted no member who had
not a special vice. Anything like virtue
produced inevitable black balls. To this
club Alouette, being a member, took us;
we entered its superb saloon, and were much
amused at the scene around us. It was
extremely pleasant.</p>

<p>London, which is the centre of our
modern world, has established the doctrine
of the separation of sexes. It is quite new,
and quite false. Let no married man go
anywhere (faith! not to the Derby, or to
Heaven itself) without his wife. Our clubs
are an abomination. Even their cookery is
beneath contempt to the man who knows
what a good home dinner is. But why do
men go in for this absurd isolation? I am
no advocate of woman's rights; and I think
if they have any wrongs, it is all their own
fault; but the general tendency of society is

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

to a ridiculous antagonism between the sexes.
I'm on the women's side, and always shall
be.</p>

<p>We entered, at I have said, the supper-saloon
of the Troy Tory Club; and I saw, at
once, several persons whom I knew. It
was a splendid room, at least fifty feet high,
with mirrors around the walls, and mirrors
in the very ceiling. There was sumptuous
entertainment, and multitudinous company.
Some were supping; others playing chess,
always a favourite game in Troy since King
Laomedon liked it; others merely drinking
the nepenthe of the country. Alouette,
who knew everybody, pointed out to me
Hector and Paris chatting together. Hector
looked a little like "a big brother," and
was evidently attempting to insinuate advice
of some sort or other (probably about
Helen), but the graceless scamp of Ida
leaned back in his chair, and picked his

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

teeth with negligence, and was saying, as
we passed,</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you may be older than
I, but you have seen nothing of the world.
It is absurd for a Troy Cockney like you to
talk about prudence and propriety to a man
who has decided which of the goddesses
was most beautiful, and who has for his
guerdon the loveliest woman of the world,
the daughter of Zeus. As to Here and
Artemis, well&mdash;you know all about that.
You may lecture away, my dear brother,
but you can't cure the incurable. I am
smitten with the inveterate disease of love.
Ask Helen."</p>

<p>"Think of Oenone," groaned Hector.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;devilish often," said Alexander.
"Nice child, but rustic. You wouldn't
compare that little villager with a lady of
divine birth like Helen, married to the King

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

of Sparta? 'Gad, what a lovely moonlight
there was on Eurotas when I took Helen
away, while Menelaus was stupefying himself
with hot Laced&aelig;monian wine!"</p>

<p>"You are incorrigible!" said the tamer
of horses. "I suppose you must take your
course."</p>

<p>"My dear brother, you are the first of
the Trojans. It is a question whether you
or Achilleus Pelides is the first man in the
world. It is no question that I possess the
first woman in the world. And you know
what Cassandra says .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"O confound Cassandra!"</p>

<p>"No, don't&mdash;she's a good, girl; and even
a family like ours need not object to a
daughter's intrigue with Apollo. No, I like
Cassandra better than any other of my fifty
sisters. She's too clever by half. However,
you know what she says?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

<p>"That I shall kill Achilles."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, boy!" said Hector, in a rage.</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay it isn't true. I care
very little, as I regard Achilles as a thorough
cad. Fancy the cowardly cur in petticoats
with Omphale. Faith, I hope Omphale
made her handmaidens flog the effeminate
hero!"</p>

<p>Hector laughed a lusty laugh. <i>Ἕστησε</i>,
who had heard the conversation, which indeed
courted no privacy, took a chair and
sat at their table, giving me a friendly nod
of dismissal. He evidently designed to talk
with Hector and Paris.</p>

<p>I turned to Alouette. She was laughing,
silently.</p>

<p>"He'll talk them to death," she said,
"and what will Homer think? Isn't it too
bad?"</p>

<p>"Dreadful," I replied. "But come, what
are you and I to do just now?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

<p>"I am going to have a few minutes' conversation
with Apollo, who has just come
down to see how matters are going on, and
who has promised to secure me a seat for
the Olympus concerts that are so fashionable
now. Good-bye&mdash;I see him."</p>

<p>Alouette ran off rapidly. Apollo Eka&euml;rgos
had shot through the air like a shaft from his
own bow. They met outside the Troy Tory
Club. I left them together&mdash;though, after
his conduct to Daphne, it must be admitted
that he is not the sort of person that the
guardian of an innocent virgin would entirely
approve.</p>

<p>Being now companionless, as <i>Ἕστησε</i> had
gone off to moralize the world, and Alouette
to demoralize it, I wandered through room
after room in aimless fashion. I came at
last to a small room in which stood a statue.
It was a female figure, life-size, in white
marble; it writhed with some unutterable

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

woe; you might say the marble wept. The
sculptor must have been a man of glorious
genius, for he had given to solid marble,
like that of Pentelicus, the sad depression,
the quivering agony, of human flesh. It was
painfully beautiful.</p>

<p>As I gazed on this wondrous work of
art, fascinated yet tortured by its agonized
beauty, I heard a step. I turned.</p>

<p>She who entered was tall, pale, with yellow
hair falling plenteously over her shoulders,
with a wistful prophetic gaze in the
bluest eyes I ever saw. They were too
blue, too clear, too deep. She looked on
the lovely anguished marble and said, in a
low whisper,</p>

<p>"<i>Troy!</i>"</p>

<p>It seemed to me, as I heard that word, as
if all the deep sorrows of Troy, told by
Homer, were crushed into it. I said nothing.
No words could have been uttered

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

in the presence of those prophetic watchet
eyes, in the very depths of which there
seemed to be great tears, like diamonds hidden
in sapphire.</p>

<p>"This is Troy," she said, with a sob.
"I am Cassandra. Apollo has kissed my
lips."</p>

<p>What whims one has! Having lived in a
quite different world&mdash;for it is a long way
from Piccadilly to Troy&mdash;I wondered whether
I ought to challenge Apollo.</p>

<p>Beautiful unhappy foreseeing Cassandra!
Prophetess-daughter of a most royal line!</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">TROY.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Κασσάνδρα περὶ τῶν μελλόντων προδηλοῖ</i>"</p>

</div>

<p>CASSANDRA. Like unto golden Aphrodite:
<i>ἰκέλη χρυσέη 'Αφροδίτη</i>. Yes, it
was she. Perchance no other woman had
ever so sad or so grand a fate. But in
this new Troy, transferred to a new planet,
perhaps with a new destiny, I was quite ready
to forget my Homer. As Alouette had run
away to flirt with Apollo, I did not see any
reason why I should not be at least polite
to dear old Priam's beautiful daughter. Nor
did I regret my slight civility.</p>

<p>I took her by the hands, and tried to

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

fathom the depth of those marvellous blue
eyes. It was vain. There lay within them
incredible prophecy of too certain disaster to
the noble city whereof Homer has sung.</p>

<p>"Ah," said she, "this is Troy, and will
be Troy for ever in the glory of golden
verse; a magic city, with a terrible doom.
I am Cassandra, and divine Apollo has clasped
me in his arms with absolute love, and
given me the sweet gift of foresight. Yes, but
no one will believe me. 'Tis no matter; what
is the use of knowing the to-morrow? Two
other cities almost great as Troy there will be
in the world unsettled yet. Neither will have a
Cassandra; they may have a Helen, beauty
maddening all the world; a Hector, hero
greater than the world; a Paris, creature
lovelier than woman; but never a Cassandra.
I alone, having touched Apollo's lips,
and having heard the sweet strange music of
his natural song, and having felt the fierce

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

glance of his eyes, am now the Lady of
Light. Let the world pass, for I have kissed
Apollo. Let old Troy be utterly erased,
except in verse; and let my father and my
mother go to some convenient alms-house,
long ago established for old Trojans; let
fair Helen go back and set the fashions
of Eurotas; let my dear father sadden that
he never believed Cassandra's words.</p>

<p>"But as for me, Stranger," she said,
"Apollo's harmless kiss has sent me forth
into the world. I know all that will happen,
and also know that not a creature will believe
me."</p>

<p>"I should like to argue that point," I
said. "Come, I believe you at once. Tell
me whatever you foresee, and I will believe
it."</p>

<p>As I spoke, her wonderful blue eyes
scintillated a strange light. She clasped her
hands nervously above her head.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

<p>"I see Rome, Paris, London!"</p>

<p>"Rome?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The city of strength! Ah! what
Rome will do! It will fall like Troy at last,
but not so nobly. It will be the heaviest
and fiercest centre of force. What Rome
does will last."</p>

<p>"And Paris?" I said.</p>

<p>"A city of cowards, rebels, and harlots!
A city of stolen splendour&mdash;of brag without
resolves. Rome is to be the soldier-city;
Paris will be the harlot-city; London&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of London?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What of London?" said Cassandra. "It
is to be the greatest city of the greatest
kingdom in the world; no more, no less.
It will contain the noblest men and the
rascalliest villains God has created. It will
be the dwelling-place of the greatest poet in
the world. London need ask nothing
nobler!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 84 -->

<p>I thought of Shakespeare, and was in love
with Cassandra at once.</p>

<p>I have been blamed for so suddenly falling
in love with Cassandra. So far as I can
understand my distant relations, who have
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an interest in my welfare is
the correct phrase, there are three objections.</p>

<p>1. She is older than I.</p>

<p>That I deny. Since I have been in Mars
I have discovered, by the records of the
Heralds' College of that planet, that I am
the man who once was Adam.</p>

<p>This is, of course, decisive.</p>

<p>2. She has been talked about with Apollo.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O dear me!
    Where is the lady,
Who has never beside the sea,
Or where heather and furze bloom free,
    Or under woodland shady,
        Taken a kiss?
        Was it a miss,
    Lady, lady, lady?</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

<p class="stanza">"O dear me!
    "What will follow,
When there's a minute of joyous glee,
When a kissable mouth you see,
    And its tempting beats you hollow?
        Why despond
        If your corespond-
    ent is joyous Apollo?"</p>

</div>

<p>After all, you know, Apollo is mere sunshine,
and perchance the lady's love might
be mere moonshine. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and this is
a devilish determinate <i>but</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I never could
love a lady&mdash;whom I loved at all&mdash;less because
she had interchanged a few kisses in
the gaiety of youth. What a direful prim
prig she would be if she hadn't! Have <i>I</i>
kissed nobody?</p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p>3. She is a professional prophetess. What
nonsense! She is as good as an estate in
Leicestershire. I shall go to Stationers'
Hall and arrange for publishing the Cassandra
Almanac at once.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

<p>Among the women of Troy I thought
Cassandra the most beautiful, as certainly
she was the wisest. I wish I could put her
on paper. No painter could do it. She
was voice and eye. Her voice startled you&mdash;her
eye held you. Andromache was all
bosom. Helen was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the clear, keen
eye of Cassandra, and her exquisite contralto
voice, made me forget all my earthly
engagements, and go in for a fierce flirtation.
You know what men are!</p>

<p>A prophetess is really a temptation. Fancy
the luxury of a wife who could tell you all
the events of the day before you drank in
bed your matutinal coffee. That would be
a noble idea. Cassandra says:</p>

<p>"If you go shooting to-day, you'll kill
plenty of game."</p>

<p>Or&mdash;"If you go into the City to-day,
you'll successfully swindle somebody."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

<p>Or&mdash;"If you ride in the Row to-day,
you'll meet Incognita."</p>

<p>Or&mdash;"If you stay at home to-day, your
uncle will make his will in your favour."</p>

<p>And in all these cases she will be speaking
the truth. Unhappily, that villainous
flirting son of Leto has laid a spell upon
her, so that even her husband could not
believe her, much as he might try. He
would go into the City when she counselled
him to look after the birds, or see Incognita
in the Row when he should wait at home
for his venerable pecunious uncle.</p>

<p>In the Troy Tory Club we had a very
pleasant little dinner that day&mdash;Cassandra,
Alouette, <i>Ἕστησε</i>, and I. It was a new
sensation. There was choice cookery of
quite unusual kinds; the culinary artists of
Ilion had devised original dinners during
the time of that immortal ten years' siege,
and the fashion of them remained; and,

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

after the dinner was over, we went into the
general saloon, where there was a most
brilliant society.</p>

<p>There was Helen. I have since seen Mr.
Leighton's attempt to depict her, of course
entirely from imagination. Had he consulted
me, I would have lent him a charming
sketch of her, which Apollo made one
day on the back of a note from Cassandra.
Much more like Cassandra was the modern
artist's Helen. The sister of the Dioscuri
was of middle height, brown-haired, brown-eyed,
with small soft hands, a wicked way
about her, a merry twinkle in her eye, a
tendency to low bodices, an artistic way of
showing her ankles. Everybody said in
Troy that she was much liker to Leda than
to her reputed father; and I can well believe
it. Indeed all the ladies in Troy were
jealous of her, since she was more dangerous
than even Cressida. As Paris once

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

remarked to me, mournfully rather, over
some <i>φάρμακον νηπενθἑς</i>,</p>

<p>"A woman who goes wrong once, won't
stop at twice."</p>

<p>When he said that, in bitter fashion
(and after a good dinner) I thought the
auburn-tressed King of Laced&aelig;mon was
avenged. It is doubtless an exciting thing
to run away with another man's wife; but
how dreary it must be to get tired of her,
and how unpleasant the thought (mitigated
only by the slight satisfaction of getting rid
of her) that she will probably run off with
some other man!</p>

<p>I can't say I admired Helen. Rather a
minx from the first, as her very early adventures
with Theseus sufficiently proved.
Not, in my judgment, worth ten years'
fighting and a couple of epic poems. However,
she understood the art of making
society pleasant, and one or two evenings

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

<i>Ἕστησε</i> and I spent at Paris's palace in Alexander
Square were uncommonly delightful.
The young prince deserved Homer's epithet,
<i>θεοειδὴς</i>. There was never anyone more
beautiful. When I saw him, I understood
why Zeus had made him the supreme arbiter
of beauty&mdash;the judge between the
trinity of goddesses.</p>

<p>Paris was the best company in the world.
I thought Helenus rather like Mr. Pitt, and
Nestor like the Duke of Wellington. But
Paris was as adventurous as Grammont, and
as witty as Luttrell. We had one grand
night together; Helen didn't know; <i>Ἕστησε</i>
and Alouette were engaged on a spiritual
s&eacute;ance, or an &aelig;sthetic tea, or a meeting for
the mutilation of unmitigated muffs. So
Paris, finding I was not engaged, said to me
at the Club,</p>

<p>"Let's have a jolly evening. Helen's
got a grand concert; and music always

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

gives me a confounded headache. Who do
you think has just come to Troy?"</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Κίρκη' ευπλοκαμος, αὺδήεσσα</i>, beautiful
daughter of the phaesimbrotous Sun. She
is here with all her mischief, all her music,
all her fun. I like Circe, though perhaps
she goes a little too far sometimes; but she
extinguished a great many fools and knaves,
and for that she deserves kudos. Aiaie has
proved a useful island, lessening the number
of hospitals and gaols and lunatic
asylums. If a fellow comes there and calls
himself a poet, Circe turns him into a dog,
and has him whipped when he howls. If he
professes to be an independent and impartial
statesman, she probably makes a pig of
him, and allows him plenty of wash. When
she catches a brave soldier, she metamorphoses
him into a lion; and so has usually a
small army of those fellows about her."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

<p>"Has she got any followers of that sort
here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She may perhaps have one or two,"
said Paris, "but if so, they will be the
quietest specimens."</p>

<p>"And you don't think she'll try to turn
you or me into any sort of quadruped?"</p>

<p>"Since I saw those three goddesses on
Ida," said Paris, "I have been magic-proof.
As for you, it will be your own fault if you
let Circe befool you. I can imagine a man's
being cheated by her in her own island, but
not in this sober city Troy."</p>

<p>The sobriety of Troy had not struck me,
but I could not contradict the King's son;
so I accepted his opinion, and went with
him to Circe's. It was a jolly reception;
lots of the fastest people in Troy; only two
lions in the room, who lay quietly on the
hearthrug, and bit nobody, so far as I know.</p>

<p>Circe is not quite my style. Very tall,

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

bright blue eyes, immensely wig-like hair,
and the most lovely contralto voice in the
world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. finer than even Alboni's. I
must say I wonder Odysseus cared much
about her. She and Paris seemed on very
familiar terms; when she took to singing
songs for his delectation, I thought of Helen's
brilliant concert. Thus she sang:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"I am the daughter of the Sun,
    And you the chiefest judge of beauty.
The goddesses were stript for you,
The world well knows what you have won;
But did you make your judgment true?
    Ah, did you do your duty?</p>

<p class="stanza">"I want a little flattery.
    So, Alexandros, please have mercy.
You tried grave look and careful touch,
Tested with care each deity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Tell me, was Aphrodite much
    More beautiful than Circe?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">ROME.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor."</p>

</div>

<p>ODDLY enough, <i>Ἕστησε</i> and I were early
next morning. The Simo&iuml;s was
rather high; we fancied a cold bath; we
strolled down from our inn, the <i>Eos and
Tithonus</i>&mdash;a good sign for early breakfasters&mdash;and
had a very pleasant dip under the
rosy-blossomed oleanders. It was a lovely
morning. The soft sweet odour of a
myriad flowers came out beneath the sunrise.
Every bough above us had its fragrant

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

bloom; every herb-tuft crushed by our
naked feet had its delicious smell.</p>

<p>"I am young again," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>He looked it. Those marvellous eyes,
which had been the wisest on Earth, seemed
the noblest and bravest in Mars. I wondered
what the dull fellows, the <i>sartores
resarti</i>, who had misunderstood <i>Ἕστησε</i> on
Highgate Hill, would think of him in Troy.
His name is perpetuated on that hillock,
as I perceived when last I wandered thither
to lunch with a poet.</p>

<p>Here by Simo&iuml;s how young he looked!
There was a grey granite cavern where we
had deposited our apparel. As we raced up
to it, sparkling spherules all over us, we ran
against a nude young lady, who appeared to
have also dipped in the divine stream. How
fast she ran away, laughing gaily, rose-flushed
all over (Darwin notwithstanding) and carolling
merrily .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O it was sad to be caught in the morning
    All without warning, when the dye
Of Apollo could smite my shoulders white!
    Helen has bathed here: why not I?</p>

<p class="stanza">"O it was sweet that they who caught me
    Only thought me a thoughtless thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Quite forgave the limbs' soft wave .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Shut their eyes as I took wing."</p>

</div>

<p>Of course <i>Ἕστησε</i> and I thought it wise to
verify the verse. We walked decorously
away, and botanically examined the ruddy
Nerine of Simo&iuml;s. Presently Alouette joined
us, laughing, and as ruddy as the oleander
itself.</p>

<p>"We may do anything before breakfast
and before Troy," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "Now,
Alouette and Antony, let us charter centaurs
and visit Rome."</p>

<p>"Centaurs!" I said.</p>

<p>"Rome!" said Alouette.</p>

<p>"I happen to know <i>δικαιότατος Κενταύρων</i>,"
he said; "he taught Asklepios and Achilles
all they knew, and would have taught them

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

more if they could have absorbed it. I met
him yesterday. He is very fond of Helen.
Goethe has told us all this. Knowing me
through friends in other planets, he asked
if he could give me any trips into the country.
I told him I was tired of Troy, and
wanted to try some other city. So it was
arranged we should breakfast in Rome."</p>

<p>"Rome!" I cried.</p>

<p>"And, by Apollo, here he is," proceeded
<i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the
magnificent curvetting of three centaur
steeds; never saw Derby or Ascot or Goodwood
aught so noble as ancient Cheiron and
the two young mares he had brought with
him. Cheiron, roan in general colour, gray in
his glorious human head with enormous age
(for has he not been leader of the Centaurs
at least three thousand years?), yet strong
as ever and stalwart. Alouette sat on his

<!-- vol 2 page 98 -->

mighty loins like a mere butterfly. Off he
sprang across the asphodel meadow.</p>

<p>"Many a lady has threaded her pretty
fingers through my old tangled mane," he
said.</p>

<p>The two mare Centaurs were bright bay
and chestnut. <i>Ἕστησε</i> chose the chestnut,
a lovely creature enough, but with fiery eyes.
The bay suited me excellent well; her eyes
were mild and soft, and when I caught her
strong sides between my thighs, she knew
her master. No bridles and saddles of course,
when you ride Centaurs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. specially if they
understand Greek&mdash;or Trojan. Touch the
cheek; say a word in the ear; move the leg
on the loin. My bay Centaur, who told me
her name was Proaxis, ran away from
<i>Ἕστησε</i> on the chestnut. But we failed to
overtake Cheiron, running away with
Alouette. Talk of Flying Childers and
Eclipse! Try the aged son of Chronos and

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

Philyra .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with a light weight lady to give
him renewal of vigour. I began to marvel
whether I should ever see Alouette again.
Is there a Gretna on Mars?</p>

<p>I talked to Proaxis, and found her a lovely
little gossip. One of the great points in
favour of the female Centaur is that she cannot
hold a pen. A hoof is no substitute for
fingers. Hence the nice nonsense which the
girl sends to sisters and sweethearts under a
penny stamp is compressed into pleasant
conversation by the mares that are daughters
of Chronos&mdash;otherwise Time. What can be
pleasanter than to ride on one of them and
hear her talk?</p>

<p>"How old are you?" I asked Proaxis,
patting her pretty bay neck.</p>

<p>"O, I'm a filly!" she said, with a fling
that would have thrown many a rider.
"I'm about two thousand, I think. Cheiron

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

would know within a century. I'm only half
broke."</p>

<p>"That's very clear," I said, "but if you
throw me I'll eat you. Come, little mare,
don't be frisky; here's a jolly sunk fence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
let's take it like a bird."</p>

<p>Another pat on the neck. That's the
way to manage anything female. We swam
over the heavy hawthorn, and came into
the meadow below with perfect ease.</p>

<p>"Pretty thing!" I said.</p>

<p>Even Centaur mares are manageable
creatures. I was amused with Proaxis. I
had only a vague idea where <i>Ἕστησε</i> wanted
to go. Presently I saw a tavern, so I
thought I would pull up and wait for my
guide, philosopher, and friend. Proaxis
was rather loth, wanting a lark.</p>

<p>Supposing, dear reader, you had ridden a
Centaur mare from Troy to the suburbs of
Rome&mdash;and supposing it was a bright bay

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

mare that carried you well, and chatted
wittily all the way&mdash;what would you give it
in the way of refreshment? What occurred
to me was, Falernian and macaroons.
Proaxis did not object.</p>

<p>"I've had a lovely ride through the city,"
says Alouette presently, coming up on Cheiron.
"It <i>is</i> so lovely. But Cheiron says he
won't go back. And, O, where's <i>Ἕστησε</i>?</p>

<p>"Horse and rider are both slow," quoth
the father of the Centaurs. "Do you sleep
in Rome to-night?"</p>

<p>This to me.</p>

<p>"Yes; decidedly."</p>

<p>"I took the liberty of saying as much to
Valerius Catullus, and he will be happy to
receive you. But you know what sort of
fellow he is; take care of your little friend
Alouette."</p>

<p>At this point <i>Ἕστησε</i> arrived, and more
macaroons and Falernian were in requisition.

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

You should have seen dear immemorial
Cheiron drink that wine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or any
other.</p>

<p>We had quite a sentimental parting with
our friends, the Centaurs, who trotted back
towards their stables in Troy. But we
wished to get into Rome for an oyster
supper with Catullus, whom <i>Ἕστησε</i> (who, I
believe, wanted to see Lesbia) praised as a
master of hendecasyllabics; and of course
Alouette had to put her pretty brown hair in
order, after a ride on Cheiron, before supping
with the Veronese; so we told the landlord
to send at once for what, in London is
called a brougham. It was in Rome known
as a cicero. It was well-horsed; but the
fellow charged us too much for taking us
to the Palatine Hill.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Catullus, meeting me with
those bright, scintillating eyes of his, as I
came over <i>Cave canem</i> to the cooler part of

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

the corridor. I knew him at once. "Lesbia
is here," he said, "C&aelig;sar is coming.
Very likely Mark Antony."</p>

<p>"I shall have to change your pseudonym,
old fellow," says <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "I have been calling
our friend Mark Antony, as he possesses
some heathen name which one cannot pronounce
unless one has a cough."</p>

<p>In came C&aelig;sar and Antony, friends
whose friendship one at once understood.
Power and grace arm-in-arm. C&aelig;sar like
a Cornish wrestler .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. breadth equal to
length. Antony tall, radiant, slender.
C&aelig;sar's voice would stir an army; Antony's
whisper would madden a woman. Indeed,
remarks which they made at Valerius's
table that night, sufficiently indicated the
difference between the two friends.</p>

<p>"No man shall ever beat me," said Julius.</p>

<p>"Nor any woman me," quoth Marcus.</p>

<p>"The oddity of this planet," suddenly

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "is, that it has no moon. I
have considered this subject with much care
since I have resided here, and, my conclusion
is that planets should be constructed
without moons. The devil's in the moon
for mischief! How in the world they get
on in Saturn and Uranus, where there were
eight moons each when the last balloon
mail arrived, is to me a mystery.
Knowing what I do of the terrene
moon's influence on lunatics, lovers, poets,
the tides, and the almanac-makers, I am
almost tempted to visit an eight-mooned
planet, to ascertain the result. It must be
Bedlam broken loose. Eight moons!"</p>

<p>"Has it occurred to you," said Mark
Antony, "that, according to Pythagoras,
or some such swell, all these planets are
moons to the sun? How deuced mad the
sun-folk must be with such a lot of moons
and moonlets!"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

<p>"I should like to see some of their
poetry," said the Veronese.</p>

<p>"<i>O rem ridiculam, Cato, et iocosam!</i>" says
C&aelig;sar. "Do you think they are much
madder than that?"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed. <i>Ἕστησε</i> took up
the parable in his usual fashion, and set to
work to connect logic with astrography.</p>

<p>"I have not worked out the whole question,"
he said; "but Earth is the home of
the dilemma, and Mars of the epigram."</p>

<p>"Explain," said C&aelig;sar. "Certainly I
was on the horns of a dilemma when I
crossed the Rubicon."</p>

<p>"As was Alexander when he cut the
Gordian knot," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "It is the
destiny on earth of all men, great or small.
Take the old story of the king who built a
bridge, and erected a gallows at the end of
it, to hang every traveller who did not tell
truly why he crossed. There came a

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

pilgrim who declared that his especial purpose
was to be hanged on that gallows.
What could the toll-man do? If he hanged
him, he had told the truth, and ought not
to have been hanged; if he did not hang
him, he ought to have been hanged for
lying."</p>

<p>"I guess what he did," said Mark Antony;
"hanged him, buried his body, and
made no report to the King. But go on
with your theory."</p>

<p>" 'Tis simple enough. Take health: if
on earth you would be healthy, you must
resign everything that renders health worth
having. You must never wet your feet in
shooting or fishing for fear of rheumatism,
nor drink wine for fear of gout, nor eat a
good dinner for fear of indigestion. Here
you find no such annoyances; the air is
light-giving, the water life-giving, the
flowers are sustenant and medicinal. We

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

cannot forget the habits of earth&mdash;we like
oysters and wine; but many natives of this
pleasant planet live wholly on the fragrance
of flowers and the stimulant water of the
streams. Then the remedies of earth are
barbarous. The man who has not a grain
of hope takes a grain of opium; revivified
for an hour or two, he is worse directly
after, and seems like a corpse that has been
galvanized. O! I love Mars, and mean to
stay here. Earth was not so good to me
that I should care to revisit the glimpses of
the moon."</p>

<p>"And how is that to be done?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The moment one of us earth men wishes
to return to earth, he is there," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought I, remembering my lost
Lucy and my wasted life, "no such wish is
mine. Mars for me!"</p>

<p>"No better oysters than these," said our
host, "had <i>ora Hellespontia ceteris ostriosior

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

oris</i>. And every oyster holds a pearl,
wherefore I compare the Mars oyster to a
perfect lyric, which is pleasant for its beauty
of style, and which also always contains a
single poetic idea."</p>

<p>Lesbia all this while had been eating the
small plump beardless oysters from their
concave shells, and daintily putting aside
pearl after pearl from each, just as earthly
damsels put aside the cherries from a tart.
Nothing had she said, except now and then
in a whisper to Valerius or Marcus, between
whom she sat. Every whisper
brought a light laugh.</p>

<p>"You might turn that thought into just
such a lyric as you describe," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>The Veronese responded:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Ay, full oft have I, looking as my lady
Put her pearls away with a dainty finger,
Pure pearls, fair to see where the bosom rosy
Trembles lovingly when the night is silent,
Deemed how sweet it were could a poet only
Make songs welcome as oysters are to maidens,
<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->Each song hiding a pearl of love within it,
Each pearl fit to be worn where Love is dwelling.
Sure things might be so in this lucky planet.
Happy orb it is, since an oyster supper
Always gives to the lady eating plenty,
Girdle, necklet, bracelets for the morning."</p>

</div>

<p>Lesbia laughed, and went on with her
oysters in a business-like way. Mark Antony
filled her glass with <i>merus Thyonianus</i>, and
said,</p>

<p>"I must have a copy of that, Valerius."</p>

<p>"Take it on memory's tablet," he said.
"Who will go on board my new yacht to-morrow?
I am for an exploring trip. I
want to see some of the strange lake-birds I
hear of."</p>

<p>"I am for the senate," said Caius Julius.</p>

<p>"And I," said Antony.</p>

<p>But <i>Ἕστησε</i> would go, and Alouette was
nothing loth, and I resolved to join them.
It was sunrise when our symposium ended.
Slave-girls took Alouette to her couch;

<!-- vol 2 page 110 -->

<i>Ἕστησε</i> and I took a walk into the open air,
but in the vestibule, pausing, he drank from
a small fountain of water, by which crystal
cups were placed. Then he took a rose from
a basket hard by, and inhaled its fragrance.</p>

<p>"Do as I do," he said. "The flowers
and waters of Mars cure all the evils that
proceed from the viands and wines of
earth."</p>

<p>We wandered to an open square, where
splashed water from the mouths of many
life-sized marble lions into an immense
basin. The sun was low, and the shadow
of a great temple was thrown right across
the tesserae of the wide square.</p>

<p>"As yet no stir of life," <i>Ἕστησε</i> said.
"What I told you just now made you look
thoughtful. At a wish, you can return to
Earth."</p>

<p>"I have no such wish."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

<p>"It may come, and suddenly. This is
the world in which Bishop Berkeley's
dream comes true, and mind creates matter.
You have seen Troy and Rome&mdash;they are
echoes of earth. Have you not, on our own
planet, seen cities in the clouds, faces in the
fire, wonders in the water? They passed
too soon. They are no more real than
these."</p>

<p>"Am I then dreaming?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not. It is rather vision
than dream. I guess what it is, though I
cannot tell you in words. If this city were
to pass away at once, I should nowise wonder.
I have been talking to a man I knew
in earth, and he has vanished suddenly, and
I felt sure he was recalled thither."</p>

<p>As I was pondering the strangeness of
this, the earlier life of the city awoke. Tall
slave-girls with yellow hair came down to

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

the fountains, with jars on their heads to
fetch water. These had blue serious eyes;
but next came black-haired black-eyed
girls, with flowers and fruit, which they
offered from white wicker baskets. There
were cream cheeses too, and other country
cakes.</p>

<p>"Let us breakfast," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.
"Though a long resident here, I have never
conquered my earthly appetite. Look at
those great purple figs."</p>

<p>"We were sitting on the marble edge of
the basin. Two shapely dark young damsels
knelt before us, offering their baskets.</p>

<p>"It seems absurd," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "when
you have just finished supper; but I never
could resist these rustic delights; and the
air and water of Mars will digest anything.
Let me tell you that both figs and
grapes go capitally with cream cheese. I was
a Devonshire man, and knew something of

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

the virtues of blending fruit with cream."
The temptation was too great. I followed
<i>Ἕστησε</i>'s example.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE POET'S YACHT.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Phaselus ille! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "</p>

</div>

<p>TIBER received us in the afternoon, and
the poet's yacht, a gaily-decorated
well-built craft, that he managed with the
aid of a couple of boys, danced merrily
down the stream. Geography in Mars is
not the geography of Earth; old Father
Tiber took us into a strange clear tideless
lake, with shores so high, and trees so high
above the shores, that the wind could hardly
reach our sails. When that happened,
the boys had to row, and rowed rather
lazily. It was a small craft; you might

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

just walk up and down the deck, with a
keen eye to the sides. <i>Ἕστησε</i>, a peripatetic
philosopher, who loved to walk as he lectured,
was sometimes slightly puzzled to
maintain his equilibrium.</p>

<p>Thus we went, Valerius and Lesbia,
Alouette and <i>Ἕστησε</i> and I, through waters
strangely beautiful. I have forgotten little
Snow, whom <i>Ἕστησε</i> insisted on calling Chione,
and who had travelled with us all the
way&mdash;nursed in her mistress's lap, as she
rode on the back of Cheiron. Snow was
great fun on this our voyage, making darts
over the side after water-birds, and being
fished out again by one of the yacht-boys,
who would plunge in to her aid when swan
or merganser became dangerous to the daring
little thing.</p>

<p>"That naughty little dog will be drowned,
I know," Alouette would exclaim; but
Chione was not drowned, and is probably

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

barking merrily on Mars to this present day.
The string of lakes, connected by a river,
through which we voyaged, was the most
curiously beautiful bit of scenery I had yet
seen. It silenced <i>Ἕστησε</i>'s effluent eloquence;
he could only gaze. The first lake we
entered was narrow, but long; it reminded
me of the upper reach of Windermere; but,
on each side there rose densely wooded
cliffs, almost perpendicular, four hundred
feet high; and on the summits of those cliffs,
grew trees as high as the cliffs themselves,
with branches so wide of spread that they
often almost met in the middle of the lake.
Hence the gloom would have been intense,
would have been horrid, unendurable, but
for two things. One was the ruddy light
which dwells in every atom of the atmosphere
of Mars, rendering a Mars midnight
lovelier than many a noon that I have seen
in Earth; the other, the clarity of the translucent

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

water, that seemed to be built up of
millions of diamonds crushed to the finest
dust. Though we sailed between those
awful cliff-walls, above which soared tree-giants
that dwarfed the Californians, the
ruddy ether streaming down met the diamond
water flashing up, and the scene was
delicious. Through the great boughs came
vast birds, strangely tame, that would alight
on the yacht; small birds, also of extreme
beauty, flying rubies and emeralds, were
just as tame; one lovely little creature,
about the size of a lady's thimble, flew
straight into Lesbia's bosom, and would not
be sent away.</p>

<p>"That is a love-bird," said Valerius.</p>

<p>Then, in the clear water below, as we
looked over the edge of the yacht, we saw
the beautiful fish swimming. Also we
beheld the cities which are built in Mars by
men who love dwelling under water&mdash;cities

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

built of superb materials, such as are found
far down in the planet.</p>

<p>Save the cities borrowed from Earth, on
the land of Mars there are no cities&mdash;only
villages. The King of Mars himself lives in
a village. But, as there are Marsmen with
a city-building desire, they are allowed to
found cities at the bottoms of lakes and live
in the water&mdash;it being provided that no
tower or spire is to come within five fathom
of the lake's usual surface.</p>

<p>It is found that, even in so fortunate a
planet as Mars, there are persons who prefer
living under water to living in the air, I
have heard that similar strange preferences
are discoverable in other planets. Some one
told me once that he considered Capel
Court the happiest nook in England. These
sublacustrine cities were lovely to look upon
from above. Alouette was never tired of
admiring. We got what may be called a

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

yacht's-eye view of them, and could see the
gentlemen and ladies walking the watery
streets, in costumes not unlike those used by
French bathers. I do not think this was for
modesty; it was partly for adornment, and
partly because living under water (even in
Mars) gets chilly in time. People who desert
fresh air for the sake of living in cities
will bear a great deal&mdash;especially if 'tis the
fashion.</p>

<p>Presently we passed from the first lake
into a narrow river. The cliffs stopped
abruptly here, and for a mile or more we
were in water much like the Thames at
Henley. Ah, but how many a Henley
rower would be glad if he could do as we
did .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dip the hollow of the hand, and
drink pure water stimulant as wine. Better
gift than Undine's, who had but to dip her
hand over the boat's side into the Danube, to
draw forth a chaplet of pearls.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

<p>I said something of the same sort to
<i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>"It can be done even in Earth," he said.
"I knew, and shall know again, one man to
whom water was as the water of Mars."</p>

<p>The river brought us into a lake lying
lengthwise, at right angles to the one we had
left. On either hand we could see through
miles of woodland, and at each end there
seemed to be great piles of building. But
the river crossed the lake (half a mile wide),
and broke through on the other side; and
when Valerius said, "What shall we do?"
Lesbia replied, "Follow the river."</p>

<p>We followed the river. It was a tortuous
stream, this time, with sloping woods on the
left and an immense sweep of green undivided
meadow, full of the crown imperial on
the right. On that meadow bank great
red oxen came to the verge, and opened

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

their Hera-like eyes, and lowed musically
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and turned tail in dismay when Snow
rushed to the side and barked with feminine
vehemence.</p>

<p>The stream grew more rapid. We rounded
a promontory, where a huge mass of red
rock, rising abruptly from the meadow,
blocked our view. We passed through a
narrow gorge into a lake that was almost a
perfect ellipse.</p>

<p>What a scene! Villages all around it,
for miles on every side. Sunset was on the
sky and on the lake below. One of those
sunsets, wherein everything on the planet below
seems turned into a glory above; when
you see cathedrals in the clouds, and great
armies, and innumerable palaces by winding
rivers. It was such a sunset.</p>

<p>"With a heart at ease," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "I
have drawn much delight from many sunsets

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

in many planets; but aught like this has
never amazed my vision. Will any one tell
me which is cloud and which fact? That
spire which shoots into the very zenith,
bearing on its summit what seems the figure
of an angel, looks solid."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> solid," said Alouette excitedly.
"That is our great church. The figure
on the summit is Michael the Archangel.
That village where it stands is the village of
the King."</p>

<p>The village was right opposite, and we
were already sailing toward it. The mighty
spire threw a broad path of shadow across
the lake, and the cathedral itself was about
four times the size of the great Pyramid.
There was nothing else noticeable about the
village except a large tent, with a banner
in front of it and a flag at its apex. I asked
Alouette what it was.</p>

<p>"That's where the King lives," she said.

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

"He always lives in a tent. When he
wants to go to another place, his tent goes
with him."</p>

<p>"But what do you call your nation?" asked
<i>Ἕστησε</i>. "And who is the King of the
next nation?"</p>

<p>I believe he did this to puzzle the child,
having already found out that the whole
planet is subject to one king. She was
puzzled. His words had no meaning to her.
I, at the moment, thought merely that she
had the Chinese notion that their Emperor
rules the world. The idea that Mars,
though only half the Earth's diameter, could
be quietly ruled by one king, rather amazed
an Englishman who had seen his nation
thrash Napoleon.</p>

<p>While we were talking, Valerius had
steered the yacht out of the direct line, and
we found ourselves in a pretty little bay,
apparently about a mile from the King's

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

village. We all went ashore save Lesbia;
then Valerius, apologetically, said to <i>Ἕστησε</i>
and me:</p>

<p>"You know what it is. One must obey
the wildest word of a woman you wildly
love, Lesbia says she must go home at
once, or die. As I don't want her to die,
I'll take her back, and then come and fetch
you.</p>

<p>"Don't think of it," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "You
are a fortunate man to be able to obey a
lady's caprice. I wish I could. It is so
hard to find either the lady or the will to
obey. Don't think of us. Travel is easy
in Mars. We will call and see you when
we are next your way."</p>

<p>Catullus went down the steep green
shore, and sprang into the yacht, and off it
flew, with Lesbia astern, a pretty creature of
many colours. <i>Ἕστησε</i> sat on the turf and

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

laughed, while Alouette and I were watching
the swift yacht pass the sunset mirrored
on the waters.</p>

<p>"All women are birds," he said. "She
is a kingfisher. Do you know the meaning
of this? She can't bear another woman.
If our little Alouette had not been with us,
she'd have been as brilliant as possible at
supper."</p>

<p>"What a pity!" said Alouette.</p>

<p>"Pity! No, indeed. The only person I
pity is our friend the poet. However, he'll
find her out one of these days&mdash;and then
there'll be some sharp work."</p>

<p>The yacht by this time was out of sight.
The sunset was fading.</p>

<p>"It was cool of him to leave us so abruptly,"
I said. "How did he know we should
find quarters?"</p>

<p>"Custom of Mars, my dear Mark. You

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

<i>can't</i> be benighted in Mars. You can't walk
a mile without coming to a house, or enter
a house door without receiving hospitality.
This being so, nobody need trouble himself
about his friends. If he deserts them, they
will find other friends. Come, instead of
arguing this matter to the utmost, let us go
and see what the King's village is like. I
am curious. I like the idea of a King's
living under a tent and in a village, and
making the fellows who <i>must</i> build cities do
it under water."</p>

<p>Off we walked, along the green edge of
the cliff, Chione barking wildly around us.
Presently a winding lane: then we came
upon the village green&mdash;a beautiful open
common, with well grown trees, and a rivulet
running through it. Boys and girls
were shouting and playing in the evenglome,
and lads and lasses sweet-hearting;

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

elder folk moralizing. It was a jolly
scene, but we passed it, in order to find an
inn.</p>

<p class="small">THE KING OF MARS.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"A king lived long ago
In the morning of the world,
When earth was nigher heaven than now."</p>

</div>

<p>THERE was no need. As we crossed a
foot-bridge over a bright rivulet, we
were met by a messenger&mdash;a youth of about
eighteen, apparently, dressed in a green
tunic, and holding a white wand in his
hand.</p>

<p>"You are strangers," he said. "You are
welcome. We saw your yacht cross the
lake. Permit me, on the part of the king,
to offer you refreshment and rest."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i>, spokesman of our trio, accepted
with grateful eloquence; and Florio, as this
young gentleman was named (he being one
of the king's pages), led us to a white tent
near to the king's, which we afterwards found
had been pitched purposely for us when
we were seen to approach from the opposite
side of the lake. The Royal Pavilion towered
enormously above us, with its great
standard floating to the wind above a mighty
mass of colour; our modest tent looked a
mere handbell by its side. But when we
entered, we found ample space. It was, as
I guess, about fifty feet in height to the
apex, and twice as many in the diameter of
the circle it enclosed. The outside, I have
said, was white; the lining was a soft blue;
the hangings were scarlet. In the centre
the red flame of a pyrogen lamp burnt delightfully
under a grass green shade. The
famous chemist (more than once mentioned

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

already) explained to me a most simple process
of extracting pyrogen from either air or
water, so as to give light. Indeed he had
invented a method of obtaining instantaneous
light at night from the water in your
carafe.</p>

<p>The interior of our tent had spaces curtained
off at several points, and we found
our conveniences as ample as if we had been
in a house&mdash;much ampler, I must say, than
in many houses I had entered on my native
planet.</p>

<p>Returning to the central apartment of the
tent, we saw a perfect banquet prepared
for us: gold and crystal charmed the eye;
flowers of unutterable beauty stood in vases
made of hollow gems, while around them
fluttered tame butterflies of marvellous
hues.</p>

<p>"We tame all creatures," said Florio, in
answer to my look of surprise. "It is a favourite

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

profession among us. You must visit
our Paradise."</p>

<p>"Ah," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "that Persian word is
used in its true sense here. It means a park
for all kinds of animals."</p>

<p>We were waited on by a series of young
pages, all dressed in Florio's style; and during
the meal a charming concert of music
was audible at such a distance as not too
fully to occupy the ear. It seemed to me,
ignorant entirely of scientific music, and only
liking an air without being able to account
for the liking, that there was something
quite new and strange in the melodies that
came floating through the rosy evening air.</p>

<p>Florio, who acted as butler, and behaved
to us as if we were a princess and two
princes, brought us, as coronal of the banquet,
two special delicacies sent by the
King. There was a bloom for each of us of

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

the Lost Rose of Troy; its imperishable
fragrance, softly stimulant, is enough to
make one credit Florio's tale, that it causes
men to be strong and women beautiful.
Its colour defies description; the outer
petals seem pale with passion, while the
core is blood-red with love&mdash;and there is a
luminous life in every leaf caught from the
fiery atmosphere of Mars.</p>

<p>"How beautiful!" said Alouette, bathing
her delicate nostrils in the impalpable odour.
"This is the flower of flowers."</p>

<p>"<i>Ut rosa fios florum, sic alauda avis
avium</i>," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>. "But what scintillates
in that crystal flask, throwing up sparks of
fire through the white fluid?"</p>

<p>"That," said Florio, "is water of Mars,
bottled at the King's birth. Our water
improves by being bottled, in a wonderful
way; the King never gives this to any but
most favoured visitors."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

<p>"Why are we so favoured?" asked
<i>Ἕστησε</i>, who had filled his glass.</p>

<p>"You come from Earth, which is the
King's favourite planet. But what have
you done? See!"</p>

<p>The strong water, as if it had been fluoric
acid, had melted the glass away.</p>

<p>"We keep this either in diamond or
platinum," said Florio.</p>

<p>Boys brought diamond goblets, and we
drank our precious lymph. Zeus! How
it cleared the palate and throbbed at the
heart! How it gave light to the eye and
fire to the nerve! We looked each at the
other in silence; <i>Ἕστησε</i> seemed young
again; Alouette's changeable eyes were like
two strong sapphires with a core of flame in
each.</p>

<p>"You look positively handsome, Mark,"
said <i>Ἕστησε</i> to me. "How long has this
<i>merum nectar</i> been in bottle, Florio?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

<p>"We don't know. The King has forgotten
how old he is."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said <i>Ἕστησε</i> to me.
"You see there are no clocks and watches
in Mars, and months and weeks and days
and hours have long been given up; indeed,
they could not have months, you know,
without a moon. The absence of a moon,
by the way, prevents lunatics, tides, and
several other absurdities. However, they
try to keep their years, which are uncommonly
long ones; and there's an observatory
where a set of ancient gentlemen keep
watch on the stars&mdash;a kind of Mars Greenwich.
Unluckily, these old fogies lose count
now and then, and drop a year or two;
and, as there is no one to look after them,
time has become a will-o'-the-wisp in this
planet. Nobody can ever guess what year
it is."</p>

<p>"Since when?" I asked.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

<p>"Ah, another difficulty. Nothing unpleasant
ever happens here, so there's no
definite point to date from. By the way,
Florio, has the King any special reason for
liking us Earthmen?"</p>

<p>"When he was a boy," said Florio, "a
visitor from Earth came, called 'OMHPOΣ.
He made poems, which the King learnt,
and can recite now."</p>

<p>"Of course the Court listens blandly.
That gives the date," he said to me. "If
Homer came here when the King was a boy,
he must be about thirty centuries old. No
need that the King should ever die."</p>

<p>While we had been talking of the king,
Alouette had slipped off to her nest; so we
finished our water, and decided to do likewise.
Rather to my surprise, our beds were
hammocks of matting, with some fragrant
substance underneath. They swung with a
slow sleepy movement, hanging about six feet

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

above the ground. It was a new sensation
to me, and I liked it well. Sleep came soon
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only too soon; I wanted to dream over
this strange world and all its amazing indwellers.
I wanted to think about Alouette,
with whom I grew half a love, in a half
Platonic way. But sleep came irresistibly;
and I dreamed of <i>Ἕστησε</i>'s words about the
mirage of this Mars-world; and in my vision
I saw the tall towers of Troy and of Rome
gradually slide from the sight and fade into
mist, like some lovely creation of the clouds,
like some fair fancy of a heated brain.</p>

<p>I was awoke by the sound of a bugle. If
I must be roused from sleep, O let such
music do it! It came over water, softened,
sweetened, glorified; for the bugler was in a
boat on the lake. The clear sound stole
into my slumbers, making me dream, ere I
woke, of things inspiriting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the falcon
in free air, the greyhound on the lea, the

<!-- vol 2 page 137 -->

maiden dancing on the green. I stretched
in my hammock and listened. As I did this,
the hammock fell gradually to the ground,
and I was in a position to attend to matutinal
necessities. When these had been duly
dealt with, I walked out through the tent
door, where I found <i>Ἕστησε</i> lounging. He
was earlier than I. He had been wandering
through the village of the King since sunrise.
"This is a queer place, Mark," he said.
"We must stay here and observe the manners
and customs of the natives. Over one
doorway I saw the inscription which I have
copied in my note-book .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="center"><i>N. O. Tfgs,<br/>
Poet.</i></p>

<p>Now I have been in Wales in my time,
but I am at a loss to know how the poet,
Tfgs, pronounces his name. It must be on
some Hebrew principle, and he has forgotten
his vowel-points. Besides, the notion of

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

a gentleman's announcing himself as a professional
poet is rather queer. There were
several others I have noted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>At this moment he was interrupted by
Florio, who told us the King asked us to
breakfast with him. The Royal Tent faced
the lake, a lovely lawn dividing it from the
water. On this lawn, a few yards from the
tent, a table was laid. As we went towards
it, we were joined by Alouette, who had
overslept herself and ignored the bugle, but
who looked none the less lovely. We three
walked across the lawn to this <i>al fresco</i>
breakfast, and stood by the table at places
assigned to us. Suddenly a bugle-call, and
a double line of youths and girls formed an
avenue from the tent door to the table. Then
another higher richer note, and the old King
came forth, walking slowly between this
duplex line of children. He was very tall,
had much white hair, and eyes of ruddy

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

violet under white brows and lashes. Those
pink violets found wild in the quarry by Five
Tree Hill give the colour of his eyes; but
there was a strange strong splendour in
them, of the gem rather than the flower.
He walked erect, though using a strong
staff&mdash;the royal sceptre of the <i>Iliad</i>&mdash;possibly
nothing more than a spud, in days
when even the gods were country gentlemen.
Yet assuredly a cudgel, when Odysseus
thrashed Thersites. He greeted us with
royal courtesy, being specially polite to
Alouette, whom he recognised as his own
subject.</p>

<p>We breakfasted in the open air. The
King was in high spirits, for, as we had
heard, Earth was his favourite planet.</p>

<p>"I learned to like you from Homer," he
said; "he came here in my youth, and
established a theogony which became
popular. Others of the same nation visited

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

us; Plato, Sophocles, Aristophanes. I
thought Plato too wise, and Sophocles too
perfect, and Aristophanes too farcical. Indeed,
I was not satisfied till a short time
after one Shakespeare arrived; and at once
I saw that he was a man mixed up of virtues
and faults, with such subtle division and
apportionment of each, that he was the very
type and embodiment of humanity. Every
utterance he syllabled sufficed to show that
Shakespeare was Earth. They are equal&mdash;those
two. I wish my brief reign might
include some one of equal power to indicate
Mars."</p>

<p>"The time will come," quoth <i>Ἕστησε</i>, in
his oracular way. He never could resist a
chance prophecy.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said the King. "If our
planet has a Shakespeare, he will have many
advantages. He will not be able to cry
Havoc! and let loose the dogs of war; but

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

he will be able to show the glory and gladness
of perpetual peace&mdash;a peace that has
never been broken, and never will. He will
be unable to sing,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Blow, blow, thou wintry wind!
Thou are not so unkind
As man's ungratitude.'</p>

</div>

<p>For we have no wintry winds here; and ingratitude
is logically impossible, since there
is nothing to be grateful for. Now, having
read and worshipped your marvellous Shakespeare,
I should like to get a poet of equal
power here in Mars to deal with our quieter
life. We have no Tragedies, no Comedies,
no Histories."</p>

<p>"The poetry of Mars is an idyl," said
<i>Ἕστησε</i>. "Appoint me your poet Laureate,
and I will prove it."</p>

<p>The King summoned an official person,
and appointed him at once. But at this
moment there entered a curious personage,

<!-- vol 2 page 142 -->

about seven feet high, with the
thinnest legs and the highest forehead ever
known. This turned out to be the Prime
Minister, my Lord Katdqxoi, who thought
himself the first man in Mars, and was certainly
not even the second. Strange it is
that the inferior intellects rule, even in a
planet like Mars, where the higher intellects
have absolute power, if only they will exercise
it. But in Mars the great statesman
does very little harm. Individual life is the
rule of the planet. As there is no indigestion,
nobody quarrels; as there is no starvation,
nobody steals. Eliminate from a planet
quarrel and theft, and what has a great
statesman to do?</p>

<p>"I have just appointed a Poet Laureate&mdash;Count
Katdqxoi," said the king. "You must
tell him his duties. I am getting tired of
birthday odes&mdash;I have heard so many; but a
fresh one in quite a different style might suit

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

me. Perhaps our friend will be able to do
something of a higher character."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and <i>Ἕστησε</i> walked
off together presently; and I confess that I
was sorry for my friend. Very shortly the
King, having, I suppose, regal duties to perform
(I cannot guess), dismissed me with
that courtesy which pertains only to royal
personages&mdash;at least, thus I am credibly informed.</p>

<p>Alouette and I walked into the village,
and were amused by its irregularities.
Everything was full of fun. Alouette, observe,
was no mortal maiden, but the most
bird-like creature ever placed in any planet
of the Solar System. So she gave me charming
guidance in this village of the King of
Mars. She, a native of the planet, a young
thing born on its surface, with pyrogen
flushing her beautiful face, was able to

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

supply me with just the information I
wanted.</p>

Our first visit was to the eminent chemist
who already has been named in these pages.
The eminent chemist, the Liebig of Mars,
told me several things which already have
been mentioned. He certainly outdid your
terrene Liebigs and the like. He showed
me a very small pill-box, labelled,

<p class="center">
<img src="fig03.png" />
</p>

<p>It contained an ox, or the essence of an ox,
boiled down by chemical methods to a mere
spoonful of meat. Swallow it, and you will
want nothing more to eat for a year at least.</p>

<p>This chemist was amusing; he had several
other scientific dodges; his applications of
pyrogen were perfectly charming. But more
amusing was the architect to whom Alouette
introduced me. His name was Hine. He
added (an unusual thing) mathematics and

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

cookery to his architecture. Alouette and
I dined with him.</p>

<p>His was a house I liked. It was all on
the ground-floor. There were no cellars&mdash;there
was no upstairs.</p>

<p>"If you want to live long," said Hine,
"conquer the attraction of gravitation. The
greatest mistake we make is walking up hills
and up stairs. I have just been building a place
for Mr. Branscombe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wolf Branscombe
they call him about here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I am
sure he would be pleased if you would go
over and look at it. He has a great number
of visitors; but I have carried out my
idea of building everything on one floor. I
have made a group of houses: some for married
people, some for bachelors, and all arranged
around the house in which old Branscombe
lives."</p>

<p>"Capital idea!" I said. "I think I knew
Branscombe in some other world. Wasn't

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

his brother generally known as Devil Branscombe?
Hadn't he a rather pretty niece
called Claudia?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know everybody," replied
Hine. "Yes, that's the man; and you may
possibly meet Claudia at Branscombe
Manor. I won't be sure you don't encounter
Raphael?"</p>

<p>Whereupon I proposed to Alouette that
we should go and see Wolf Branscombe,
telling her that I had some dim recollection
of him on Earth; and Alouette had not the
slightest objection in the world. So, with
Hine's introduction, we went over to Branscombe
Manor.</p>

<p>When we reached the place, our charioteer
had to descend and blow a bugle,
hung beside a drawbridge which crossed a
wide moat. The whole place is enclosed by
a moat, and completely isolated. Having
got within this water boundary, we saw a

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

charming group of houses, arranged amid
pleasant lawns. All were one-storeyed, but
every story was high and cheerful. The
centre of the group, Wolf Branscombe's
own, was a building thirty feet high, with a
central galleried dome above a cloister,
running to a couple of hundred feet. Scattered
around it, at uneven distances, were
houses and cottages of many kinds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
some that would suit a married couple with
children, some that would suit a married
couple without, some that would suit that
most troublesome of guests the Bohemian
bachelor. There was also a banquet-hall,
a spacious ball-room, and a stately library.
It was a pleasant scene. Alouette and I immensely
enjoyed it. This, we agreed, was
the perfection of country life. To build a
huge edifice which it is a day's work to
climb over, and where you never revisit
your bed-chamber because it is too far to go,

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

is a mere mixture of idiocy and ostentation.
Build yourself a pretty central place, that
will house you and your wife and children
and immediate attendants. Run up isolated
places for your mediate servants and for
your guests. Instead of your house being a
huge block of building, let it rather resemble
a village. That is the country-house
architecture of Mars. It was originated by
Michael Angelo, when he first visited that
planet. It was carried to completion by
our friend Hine. When Alouette and I had
crossed the drawbridge, we wandered carelessly
about the grounds, awaiting a chance
of introduction to their owner. We had
not to wait long. The black-bearded wild-eyed
strong-handed old pirate turned up
shortly, and fell in love with Alouette at
first sight; asked us to have some lunch,
and stay for a year. This is the way things
are done in Mars. Staying for a year seemed

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

doubtful; but we agreed to the lunch.
I will not describe it, for fear of annoying
the eunuch of letters. There was pyrogen
in the water.</p>

<p>"You must stay a day or two here," said
the old Wolf, "unless you are much engaged.
I expect some people you will like to
see. Come across the lawn, and I will show
you your rooms."</p>

<p>We followed him across a lawn of emerald
velvet, on which trees of scarlet and
sapphire bloom were frequent, and came to
a lovely little cottage of about four rooms,
where just one servant-maiden was ready to
attend on us.</p>

<p>"Will you stay here?" said Wolf Branscombe.</p>

<p>I looked at Alouette, who looked merrily
at me, and answered,</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," says Wolf, "we shall have

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

company .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people you'll like, both of you.
I'm an old fogy, a dull fellow. I'm used-up.
But you'll like Raphael and Claudia.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Off strode the Wolf across the lawn. I
turned to Alouette.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," I said, "you and I are left
alone. Are you afraid to be alone with me?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think you insult me and
degrade yourself by asking such an absurd
question?" she replied. "If I were afraid
to be alone with you I could not deign to
speak to you."</p>

<p>"What a stern rebuke!" I said.</p>

<p>"Too stern, perhaps. Too stern certainly,
for I know you spoke in kindness; but
men ought to learn that women know a
gentleman from a scoundrel."</p>

<p>"I hope I am not a scoundrel altogether,"
I said.</p>

<p>"No," answered Alouette, putting her

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

lovely lively lips to mine. "No&mdash;you are
nothing of the kind. I should be in love
with you, but an instinct tells me you belong
to somebody in another planet. Yet, for
all that, I am willing to love you very much
indeed."</p>

<p>Alouette began to cry. I thought before
she was all laughter. Yet the women who
laugh most gaily have often the fre&euml;st fount
of tears. When the spherules dropped from
Alouette's dear eyes, I felt almost a criminal.
Why could I not dwell in Mars for ever,
with Alouette for my bride? <i>I could not</i>.
The thought of Earth was upon me, the
return to my own native planet, the life I
had lived long ago. Mars was lovely, and
Alouette was lovely; but Mars was not
Earth, and Alouette was not exactly a woman.
She hadn't weaknesses enough .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Mars
hadn't London enough.</p>

<p>However, Alouette and I slept in one of

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

Wolf Branscombe's cottages: and I fear the
Wolf has to this day the impression that we
were man and wife. Between Alouette and
me, however, there was simply what is styled
Platonic love. Three kinds of love exist.
There is passion; the royal strong irresistible
unquenchable passion which conquers
all obstacles, being the divine desire and
resolve of a man who has seen the only
woman in the world that can satisfy him.
That passion I have known; not to have
known it is not to have lived. There is
appetite, the erotic fancy; the liking (I cannot
strictly call it <i>love</i>) which grows out of
a woman's being pretty to look upon. This
is merely contemptible. Thirdly, there is
what has been called the Platonic affection.
It deserves clearer definition, and I am not
sure it does not deserve cultivation. It is
the magnetism of the mind. There is no
wretched wantonness about it.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

<p>This last form of sexual intercourse rests
on a definite scientific basis. <i>There is a sex
in souls</i>. This admitted, men and women
can meet each other on intelligible terms.
Why should mere physical ideas trouble and
untranquillize the brain of creatures capable
of such infinite capacities as ours? I take
<i>love</i> as the test. What is love? Must it
consist of kisses and other things of the same
sort? May not love reside in one glance of
the eye, in one utterance of the lip? I
suppose I might love Alouette, without being
sued for breach of promise of marriage.</p>

<p>In Mars there are Courts of Love, as
there used to be in this planet of ours in the
Middle Ages. The Judges are ladies.
Many questions are tried by them; one of
especial note is plagiary. Any poet who
borrows is publicly flogged. I should like

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

to see the rule applied to my poor dear old
native planet.</p>

<p>Alouette and I found Wolf Branscombe's
hospitality very jolly indeed. He left us
quite alone. We dined with him, that
was all. We made the Platonic love I have
mentioned.</p>

<p>"How was it made?"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>Now here is a song that was sung one
night when Alouette and I were alone over
our coffee:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"I do not wish to touch your hand,
    I do not wish to kiss your lips,
I only wish to know your soul,
                My darling child .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="stanza">"All your sweet thoughts to understand,
    Fair fancies that my own eclipse,
Beautiful dreams that heavenward roll.
                And drive men wild.</p>

<p class="stanza">"I want to look in those dark eyes,
    And know what secret lingers there,
I want to know what magic lies
                In that brown hair.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

<p class="stanza">"I want .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want what cannot be,
    Though Solar Systems swerve and swing,
That you should mix your soul with me,
                You sweet young thing."</p>

</div>

<p>It is unfortunate that the second stanza
was constructed on different metric system
from the first; but Alouette forgave me,
as I hope the reader will do likewise. And
I venture to think it would be well for
the planet Earth, if there were upon it
more of the class of love which I have
indicated. Women were not designed to
be mere physical comrades of men; they
were also meant to be their intellectual and
poetical associates. Look at Shakespeare's
wonderful gallery of perfect portraits:
Rosalind in the green-wood, Portia in a
Venetian court of justice, Desdemona in her
dire disaster, Ophelia driven wild by Hamlet's
sad sorrow, Cordelia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ah, Cordelia!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for her there is a litany of love.
Look farther back, at dear Shakespeare's

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

sole compeer, Homer. Hector's Andromache!
Can anyone who has read the <i>Iliad</i>
think of her without tears in his eyes? If
so, I am sorry for him.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN <i>Ἕστησε</i> rejoined me, he brought
an invitation from an acquaintance
he had made, who united the two delightful
occupations of poet and gardener.</p>

<p>"Let us go and see him," he said. "He
grows the Cleopatra medlar, and a medlar
named after the serpent of old Nile must
be delicious."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

<p>"How should you like a Christabel
nectarine?" asked Alouette.</p>

<p><i>Ἕστησε</i> laughed.</p>

<p>"True words," he said, "are often spoken
in jest. We will visit Melanter, and
he shall lecture you on the georgics of Mars.
Their development would amaze Publius
V. Maro, as I believe the Americans call
him."</p>

<p>So we visited Melanter, and were delighted
with our visit; and not delighted only,
but made wiser thereby. His grounds
were on the border of a pleasant lake, with
a laughing rivulet running through them.
He entertained us poetically, with huge
piles of exquisite fruit and sparkling wine,
and Mars water and classic thought. He took
us through acres of glass, through wide wandering
paths of garden.</p>

<p>"We are fortunate here in Mars," he
said. "I first tried gardening by the Thames&mdash;here

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

it is preferable. Come no east winds,
no hail-storms, and no blights. Besides,
our fruits and flowers are transfigurations.
Look at that rose."</p>

<p>It was a soft white flower, with a ruddy
blush in the very heart of it, and its fragrance
was mysteriously delicious.</p>

<p>"That," said Melanter, "is the Juliet rose;
when our dear Shakespeare created the fair
Capulet, those roses began to bloom in Mars.
You see love blushing in a maiden heart.
By the way, do you like mulberries?"</p>

<p>I instantly confessed a great liking for
that fruit.</p>

<p>"Look at these," said Melanter.</p>

<p>Wonderful juicy berries were they, full of
flavour, vast in size, looking a lovely red
amid the dim green leaves.</p>

<p>"That," quoth Melanter, "is the Rosalind
mulberry. Its arrival in Mars was coincident
with '<i>As You Like It</i>.' "</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

<p>While we were thus conversing in this
enchanted garden, there suddenly broke
forth a strain of song:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"I have been far through realms of air;
    I have known agony, anguish, regret;
I have returned to a vision fair,
                My sweet pet.
    'Come to me, child with the golden hair?
                O, not yet?'</p>

<p class="stanza">" 'No, not yet.' Well, what fears she?
    Kiss of lip that never has lied?
She would be wiser to come to me,
                Sweetheart and bride.
    Ah, her 'not yet' has set me free&mdash;
                Then love died."</p>

</div>

<p>"That's a pet parrot of mine," said Melanter.
"I give him plenty of modern
poetry to read, and he imitates it capitally.
I fancy he has lately been studying Heinrich
Heine. He is not very brilliant to-day; for
I don't think they put any brandy on his
matutinal lump of sugar."</p>

<p>He was certainly a splendid bird. His prevalent

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

colour was olive green, but here and
there were frills and fringes of the richest
scarlet&mdash;such scarlet as one sees in the passionate
heart of a July rose, or in the supreme
moment of a July sunset.</p>

<p>"Sing again," said Melanter; and the bird
obeyed,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">    " 'Sing again,' my master says:
                The bird obeys .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Sings of the beautiful bright rose-bloom,
Sings of the heavy leafage-gloom,
Sings of whispers in lime-walks heard.
Must not echo a single word&mdash;
                Being a bird.</p>

<p class="stanza">    "Ah, if she wore, instead of wings,
                Other things!
Then beneath limes she would shyly trip.
Then the beak would turn to a lip,
Then she'd plumage of silk unfurl,
Then she'd cause male brains to whirl.
                Being a girl."</p>

</div>

<p>"Curiously clever specimen of the Psittacus
tribe," said <i>Ἕστησε</i> to Melanter. "Nobody
is surprised at anything in this planet,

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

but on Earth that parrot would make a man's
fortune."</p>

<p>"My fortune," replied Melanter, "is made.
I can grow grapes and write verse. What
more do I want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the answer. "The man
who can take his wine in pills and relish
versing has nothing the matter with his physical
or psychical health. When I was in
that other planet I regret to say that I exchanged
verse for prose and wine for opium.
I am wiser now. I like the water of Mars."</p>

<p>"It is the most marvellous fluid in the
Solar System," said I.</p>

<p>Amid the odours of Juliet roses and Christabel
lilies, with Rosalind mulberries and
Beatrice nectarines and Cleopatra medlars
and sweet Anne Page strawberries to furnish
our out-of-door dessert, we talked of other
peculiarities of this planet Mars.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

<p>"Have you heard of the Hermits?" asked
Melanter.</p>

<p>We had not.</p>

<p>"O, then, <i>I must</i> take you to see them.
Let us go over to-morrow. You will see
some of your oldest acquaintances .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
I won't tell you beforehand."</p>

<p>Next morning, after a somewhat late night
in the divine alleys and lawns of Melanter's
garden&mdash;a garden as exquisite as that of King
Alcino&uuml;s&mdash;we started to the Hermitage. It
lay higher up the beautiful rosy mere whose
waters laved Melanter's garden. We went
in a sailing boat of single sail, our friend
steering. As we traversed the water the
lake grew wider, the trees more sublime in
their aspect; especially we noted giant
growths of the &AElig;sculus, their boughs descending
to the virgin turf, their lamp-like
pyramidal blooms of many colours unknown
to our planet. As our lazy sail glided onward,

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

<i>Ἕστησε</i> all the while talking as he was
wont to talk by other lakes almost as beautiful
upon another orb, the mere grew narrower
gradually, and the trees seemed to
grow grander in size, and we were almost
in darkness beneath them, but for the
radiant sparkle of the water, every atom of
which resembled a crushed gem. Then we
entered a granite gorge, not much wider than
a Thames lock. At the end of this there
was a pier; to this Melanter moored his boat,
and we landed. On a wide lawn, dotted at
intervals with those vast specimens of the
&AElig;sculus whose summits reached a high
region of air, there stood a circular building
crowned with a lofty dome. We approached
it in silence; wide open stood the doors,
and the interior, all of white marble, revealed
to us a lovely circle of statues. There
were seats also of marble two-thirds round

<!-- vol 2 page 165 -->

the edifice; and a raised platform faced
them.</p>

<p>"This is the Theatre," said Melanter.</p>

<p>"When used, and for what?" asked
<i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>"It is designed for the recital of the highest
poetry, and nothing but the highest. The
Hermits are the judges. If they allow unanimously&mdash;for
there must not be one dissentient
voice&mdash;that any epic or drama or
lyric is of the highest class, the king comes
to hear its author recite it."</p>

<p>"When was the last recital?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I can find no record of one for a thousand
years," said Melanter.</p>

<p>"I doubt if there has been one since the
Theatre was built," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>.</p>

<p>AROUND the theatre, at equal distances
across the lawn, we saw a series of
charming dwellings embroidered in trees.</p>

at home, I wonder? It would be strange.
They are generally out on wild expeditions."</p>

<p>We walked round the beautiful lawn.
On the garden-gate of the first hermitage
we saw in golden letters the name <i>Homer</i>.
There seemed no movement in the house,
but a tall maiden, that looked a princess,
was tending the birds and flowers.</p>

<p>"Homer is away with Circe or Calypso,"
said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "and has left Nausicaa to take
care of his hermitage."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

<p>In Shakespeare's retreat we saw Rosalind
teaching a nightingale to sing <i>Concolinel</i>.
What other names we saw on other gateways
may be left to imagination; only,
strange to say, there was not a hermit at
home; they were all off on a&euml;rial voyages,
as <i>Ἕστησε</i> had predicted.</p>

<p>But on the seventh portal there was, to
our amazement, no name.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, "who is the lost
Pleiad of this galaxy? Let us enter and
explore." He pushed the gate as if he
knew the trick of it. Beautiful exceedingly
were the flowers which bloomed in this
secluded garden. The moment we entered
we were in complete seclusion, and amid a
fragrance wholly indescribable. Fountains
flashed in the air, birds sang even stranger
songs than Melanter's parrot. The hall
door stood wide open. In a pleasant book-room,
containing behind glittering glass the

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

choicest of Earth's classics, there was on the
table a choice collation of fruit, that tempted
the taste.</p>

<p>We all sat down with alacrity, not unwilling
to rest in this quiet hermitage.
Alouette was soon eating a nectarine as fair
and fragrant as herself. I took a mighty
draught of Mars water.</p>

<p>"Do you like this?" asked <i>Ἕστησε</i> of
Melanter.</p>

<p>"I do indeed."</p>

<p>"Then often come to see me. I love to
talk with mariners like you. I am going to
stay."</p>

<p>"To stay!" we both exclaimed; but
Alouette seemed in no degree surprised,
knowing, doubtless, the customs of Mars.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I will be the seventh
hermit. I am the lost Pleiad. The King
of Mars designed this for me, I know by
inevitable instinct. He does things royally,

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

you see. You must all consider yourselves
my guests."</p>

<p>We remained in the hermitage some days,
during which <i>Ἕστησε</i> became marvellously
poetic. We explored the other hermitages,
but did not meet any of their chief inhabitants,
who seemed all away on business, or pleasure,
or both. But the place was populous with
their dependents and retainers; and we met
Nestor and Polonius, talking in the wise
strain of ancient experience; and caught
Tro&iuml;lus and Don Juan exchanging amorous
anecdotes. At eventide there would be
songs and dances on the green, pleasant
lyrics of love and spring, stately minuets,
in which Byron and Mercutio almost crossed
rapiers who should lead out Helen of Troy.
It was a gay hermitage in the absence of all
the hermits but one; and he, too, was not
devoid of gaiety, for he had an idea in that
marvellous head of his which he one afternoon

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

unfolded to me under the shadow of a
great plane-tree, while Alouette and Melanter
were playing chess in a cool nook of
honeysuckle just across the lawn.</p>

<p>"Should a hermit live alone, do you
think?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It does not seem the custom in this
hermitage," I answered.</p>

<p>"It is neither customary nor pleasant,"
he said. "Well, you will be returning to
our old friend's planet soon. You will live
a second life far happier than your first.
You will remember me in my hermitage
with Alouette."</p>

<p>"With Alouette!" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "I know your
Platonic love for her. But she is mine. I
created her. She is my Genevieve.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'I calmed her fears, and she was calm,
And told her love with virgin pride;
And so I won my Genevieve,
    My bright and beauteous bride.' "</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

<p>There was no appeal against this. It was
unanswerable. As I gazed on this wild
Alouette, she grew more and more in my
vision to resemble the lady who</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. leaned against the armed man,
The statue of the armed knight;
"Who stood and listened to his lay
        Amid the lingering light."</p>

</div>

<p>She had just beaten Melanter at the
Muzio gambit, and stood up triumphant
against a handsome sapling oak. As the
pyrogen-laden air streamed through her
tresses, it was more than a substitute for
<i>Ἕστησε</i>'s vision of moonlight long ago. She,
with instinctive knowledge of what was
happening, tripped across the lawn, and
threw herself into his outstretching arms.
Melanter looked on with a humorous smile.</p>

<p>"I acquiesce," I said.</p>

<p>"You are wise," said <i>Ἕστησε</i>, in his tone
of the oracle. "Yet acquiesce not always.

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

In this orb we recognise things opposite:
learn to resist, yet acquiesce; learn to know
society, yet isolate yourself. Farewell."</p>

<p>They walked toward the hermitage,
Alouette flinging me a Parthian glance&mdash;half
her own fun, and half the pathos of
Genevieve. I have not seen them since.</p>

<p>"Will you drop down the lake with me?"
asked Melanter.</p>

<p>"I think not," I said; "if you will forgive
me."</p>

<p>"I not only forgive, I approve," he replied.
"<i>Never go back, never think twice</i>,
are the two main maxims of Mars. I have
been breaking them ever since I came,
which is why I am here so long."</p>

<p>"I think from my short experience I can
add a third," was my answer. "<i>Be alone</i>.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>He went down to the pier, where
lay his boat; I started through the hermitage

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

in exactly the opposite direction.</p>

<p>As I passed on, almost savagely, looking
neither right nor left, just as if I had been
an adventurer in Africa, determined to find
Prester John or die, I pondered much
within myself the phantasmagoria through
which I was passing? Was it a dream?&mdash;was
not my past life, rather, a dream?
Had I ever killed my best friend&mdash;lost my
only love&mdash;lived the life of a recluse? Was
it all a vague vision of the past&mdash;from
Ellesmere to Five Tree Hill&mdash;from Lucy,
amid her roses and nightingales by the
Thames, to Lucy dead on her knees by my
death-bed? Was Earth itself a dream?
Could I return thither, or was there no
such star wandering through the grey-blue
ether?</p>

<p>I came to no conclusion. I walked on,
stolidly, defiantly. I thought of the triad
worked out by Melanter and myself:</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Never go back;
Never think twice;
Be alone."</p>

</div>

<p>These things will I do in Mars, methought,
for they seem to suit this planet; but, if
there be an Earth, and I return thither,
utterly I abjure them. The Prodigal Son
went back; the Creator of mankind thought
twice; the sons of Adam have never found
it good to be alone. No: I will walk
through this land of dreams, and read it
backward.</p>

<p>While thus thinking, I had noted nothing
of the road I took. All at once there came
a prattle of voices, and on the velvet grass
of what seemed a common I saw groups of
children playing all manner of games, and
laughing gaily in the sunshine. It was as if
an immense child's school had broken loose
for a holiday. There were boys at leap-frog
and rounders; there were girls dancing

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

and playing <i>les graces</i>, and running after
hoops; there was battledore and shuttlecock
in profusion, and the white-feathered
toys made bird-like flight in the air. Little
boys were on their knees, intent upon marbles;
little girls were as intently nursing
dolls. Not a creature under the grave
trees that looked tenderly on their sport
seemed above eight years old. There were
mere babies among them&mdash;but no visible
nurses.</p>

<p>The scene was so pleasant that I had not
thought of myself or my late meditations.
Presently a brown-haired girl perceived me,
and ran to where I stood, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Little boy, come and play!"</p>

</div>

<p>"LITTLE boy, come and play!"</p>

<p>I looked at myself. Why, I <i>was</i> a
little boy, and a very little one&mdash;not above
three, I should think. I was changed without
knowing it. I was in a low frock, with
bare legs. I was not only amazed, but

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

disgusted. I looked sulkily at this persecutor,
who now appeared to me a giantess,
and put my finger in my mouth, and began
to cry. She, the wretch! an old woman of
eight, only laughed and said,</p>

<p>"Come along, or I shall smack you!" at
the same time applying her little rosy hand
to my bare shoulders.</p>

<p>Well, as she dragged me along so fast
that I had no time to think, and as resistance
was impossible, in a few seconds I
found myself rolling on the grass, amid a
heap of babies of my own apparent age.
Somehow, we soon made friends. My memory
of the past faded before the intense instinct of
the moment. We played in our own helpless
way, and made each other understand without
articulation. As I found myself in this
primitive condition, yet with thoughts of the
past on my mind, in vague and transient
form, I wondered whether the ordinary

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

baby of Earth, looking so confoundedly
meditative and wise, is thinking of a world
he has lately left.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we were brought
in to a supper of the baby sort by a host of
nurses, and kindly washed, and deposited in
cribs in one great dormitory Tired with
rolling on the grass, I fell asleep at once. I
awoke next day a year older .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this being
the law in the Child Land of Mars. It
is a law which applies only to strange visitors;
and the brown-haired hoyden who had
hauled me into the midst of the place was
an actual daughter of Mars, and grew older
only by days. Hence in three days I was
old enough quite to fall in love with Miss
Hoyden, who by this time was only two
years my senior. She was the wildest little
romp in the world, but she didn't mind
making love in the most pathetic manner. I
kissed her many times a day, and we swore

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

eternal fidelity to each other. On the
second day of our engagement, when I had
reached the mature age of seven, we were
married by a group of our playfellows, under
an old willow archway, that made a beautiful
church. We had two parsons; and a
father to give her away; and a groomsman
for me; and a troop of twelve little bridesmaids
all in white, which indeed was the
prevalent colour in Child Land. Then
came a wedding breakfast on the grass, consisting
chiefly of lollipops and blackberries,
with gingerbeer for drinking healths. It was
a long business altogether; and just before
the final speech was made we departed for
our honeymoon, in quite an ignominious manner.
For the gong sounded, and out trooped
the nurses, and my bride and I were
washed and put into crib beds very far apart.
However, you see I had two days happiness
with her; and she made a desperate vow to

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

grow up for my sake only, which I hope she
broke at least a dozen years ago. We were,
I think, as affectionate a couple as I remember
during the period of our married life&mdash;though
I was a child of Earth and she of
Mars&mdash;though I grew a year a day, and she
didn't&mdash;though we were compelled, like people
of fashion, to keep separate apartments.
Alas, I fear she has forgotten me.</p>

<p>I went to bed as usual, on the evening of
what I must call my eighth year, after my
usual affectionate parting with my bride,
who was eating a huge sugar-plum I had
given her, and who certainly seemed to like
me better the bigger I grew. I was a
troublesome child that night after our parting,
and kicked considerably under the infliction
of the bath, since my dignity as a
married man commenced to dawn upon me.
The nurse avenged herself by poking soap
into my mouth and eyes, and giving corrective

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

taps to various parts of my small
person. Altogether I found myself in my
little white bed in a vile temper, with a
taste of soap in my mouth, and a smarting
sensation, that I felt would render it uncomfortable
to sit down next day, and an
heroic determination, when I grew up, to
organize a revolution&mdash;have all nursemaids
whipped to death, and abolish washing for
ever. Conscious somehow that I was growing
a year a day, I felt I should be a man in
a fortnight; that a few weeks would convey
me to remote and worn-out regions of
antiquity, did not occur to the buoyant
infant.</p>

<p>There I lay, like the young Hercules in
his cradle strangling serpents. I could not
sleep. My thoughts were too vivid, my
smarts too severe. I meditated on the
coming revolution. Although no light
burnt in the vast dormitory, there was

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

diffused through wide windows the inextinguishable
light of the Mars air. I looked
at the long line of beds with pitying contempt
on their sleepy inmates&mdash;it did not
occur to me that they had no sensitive
reasons for staying awake.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt heroic resolve. The
little girls slept on the other side of the
great dormitory&mdash;why should I not cross it,
and seek my bride, so ruthlessly severed
from me? You see, growing a year a day,
I was older every hour. The detested
nurses slept elsewhere. I would try it.</p>

<p>I got out of bed, and walked to the other
side&mdash;about fifty feet, I should judge. With
all my heroism, I was in a frightful funk.
If one of those horrid nurses should happen
to awake, what might I not expect? Once
or twice I thought of turning back, but I did
not.</p>

<p>Arrived there, I was puzzled. How

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

should I find the bed of her whom I
wanted? If I pinched the toes of the
likeliest-looking little girls, there would be
a commotion. What was I to do? I
walked along the line, and at last was
rewarded by seeing somebody sitting up in
bed, and staring at me. There was much
fuzzy hair, that no night-cap could restrain.</p>

<p>It was she!</p>

<p>"O," she said, "I can't sleep, for the
soap in my eyes, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before she could finish a sentence
which seemed to promise terrible revelations,
I found myself caught up bodily and
replaced in my bed, with stern admonition
to go to sleep, and one or two additional
reasons for staying awake.</p>

<p>Childhood's woes soon heal; childhood's
slumber is not long delayed. I slept.</p>

<p>When I awoke I was a child no more&mdash;in
my natural form I lay beneath the

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

shadow of a great lime-tree, in the midst of
a meadow that looked like a prairie.</p>

<p>I was not surprised. That feeling had
long perished in my mind. I was sorry for
my little child-wife, whom I knew I should
never see again, for I had firmly resolved
not to turn back&mdash;and who, by turning back,
can revisit Child-Land?</p>

<p>Then, lying on the turf, short and sweet
as if it grew on the side of some inaccessible
fell, I wondered why I had been a child for
six days. Had I anything to learn thereby,
negative or positive? It was something,
certes, to have felt a child again; to have
been petted, patted, soothed, scolded; to
have played with children, enjoyed their
dainties, lived on bread and milk, been put
to bed by daylight. I was not dissatisfied
with my little adventure.</p>

<p>As I thus meditated, I heard music&mdash;the
sound, apparently, of a single flute, played

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

most deliciously to a simple air of gaiety.
I sprang to my feet. I could not see
whence came the sound, but followed it as
if it magnetised me. Crossing from the
great meadow through an archway, I entered
a long avenue of trees, cut into
rounded forms by the most careful of
pruning. They sprang from the greenest
grass; the wide path was the very poetry
of gravel.</p>

<p>"Never turn back," thought I, and strode
on to the ch&acirc;teau which ended this superb
vista.</p>

<p>LOOK at Meissonier's illustration to <i>Le
Malentendu</i>, at p. 233 of <i>Les Contes
R&eacute;mois</i>, by the Count de Chavasse, and you
may at once imagine the sort of place at
which I had arrived. Up the long avenue

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

I loitered, while the sweet suggestive magnetic
music grew nearer, yet hardly louder.
It was music indescribable; it was like unto
that whereby the Piper of Hamelin, mentioned
in legend of the Middle Ages, could
make both rats and children follow him.
There is in music something which the highest
masters of music have as yet found unfathomable.
They may make their "songs
without words," but they cannot bind a
definite meaning; to those songs. The
melody which to Romeo seems all love
shall to Mercutio seem all laughter and to
Tybalt all rapier. Poetry, which in its supreme
form <i>contains</i> music, is to some degree
thus receivable; but of music it may fairly
be said that probably the idea in its composer's
brain is never identical with any one
of the myriad ideas which it kindles in other
brains, and of which no two coincide. The
metaphysic of music has never yet been

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

thoroughly investigated, and I have no time
to do it as I walk up the green alley beneath
arched boughs which leads to the Ch&acirc;teau
Venus.</p>

<p>Thus was this stately yet giant building
called. I entered upon a wide terrace,
radiant with flowers, and graced with fair
forms of marble. The music came from the
terrace just above, reached by three or four
marble steps. Ascending, I saw a fountain
leaping in the sunshine, and washing chiselled
groups of Naiads, with Hylas hidden
among them; and on the balustrade of its
basin leaned the musician, a fair long-ringleted
youth, in costume of no special
age .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all brocade and silk, feather and
lace, with the pinkest hose from knee to
foot, and the brightest of diamonds for shoe-buckles.
As he played on a quaint pipe or
flageolet, all his notes dropped like words into
my ear. The liquid syllables seemed to say:</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Sweet, ah, sweet
    To throw the hours away.
Tinkle, music! twinkle, feet!
Let each pulse of wild joy beat!
    It is our own, this day.</p>

<p class="stanza">"No, ah, no!
    Grasp we the minutes tight!
Rhyme, be silent! Time, be slow!
Blush to rose, fair breast of snow!
    It is our own, this night."</p>

</div>

<p>And what the liquid syllables of the music
said seemed likewise to sing the liquid
spherules of the fountain, which threw
streams of radiant water on the white shoulders
and bosoms of the naughty nymphs
who were hiding Hylas. Across the terrace,
half-way to the Ch&acirc;teau's beautiful vine-festooned
portal, I now noted that the supreme
sculptor had placed a statue of Herakles
himself, searching for the lost boy, with
club and lion's hide, so gigantic that it almost
dwarfed the fountain.</p>

<p>Gay groups, in fantastic dress, were scattered

<!-- vol 2 page 191 -->

over terraces and gardens. Dances,
and games, and flirtations were in high progress.
When the Troubadour of the fountain
beheld me he stopped his piping, and
stepped forward, with either reverence or its
mockery, and said, "Monseigneur le Prince
de la Terre, deign to enter the Ch&acirc;teau of
Monsieur le Duc de l'Amour."</p>

<p>At this instant came forward the Duke
himself, a superb and sprightly but somewhat
soft presence, with ladies and pages and a
marvellous grouping of soldiers around. As
I looked from one side to the other of this
fair frolic fantastic scene, what fascinated
me most was, not the Duke's brilliant beauty
of youth, nor any of the marvellous loveliness
of the demoiselles around him, nor the
general contour and effect of the Ch&acirc;teau,
and its delicious garden, but the angry face
of the colossal Herakles, and the grip his
huge right hand held of a club as vast as

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

Owen Glendower's oak. But, being recognised
as Prince de la Terre&mdash;a lofty title,&mdash;and
being surrounded by creatures that
sparkled and welcomed and smiled, I did
my best to be courteous. I succeeded. The
time had arrived for a banquet&mdash;it
always was time for a banquet&mdash;at the
Ch&acirc;teau Venus. This was a superb festivity.
It was served in the Hall Anadyomene, so
called because great pictures of the Love-goddess
rising from the sea ran round all
four sides of it, and culminated in the domed
ceiling. Pity Thornhill could not have seen
them, ere he painted so many Dutch Venuses
and Cupids with water on the brain.</p>

<p>"Prince," said the Due de l'Amour, "it is
the custom for all strangers who honour us by
their presence to narrate the history of
their adventures. It need not be now&mdash;stay
till you have been here a week or a
century&mdash;but we beseech you, the most illustrious

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

visitor we have lately received, to
gladden us with your romance, which must
be full of delight. Then when you leave, I
will ask you to choose and take with you
the rarest rapier in our armoury, the swiftest
steed in our stable, the loveliest lady in
our suite."</p>

<p>As thus the Duke spake, there was a joyous
burst of applause, and the Troubadour,
guitar in hand, broke forth thus:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Sword! let thy temper be
    Such as shall make foes wince!
He can well use thee,
    Being a Prince.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Steed, let thy courage be
    That of thy sires long since!
He can well stride thee,
    Being a Prince.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Lady! thy smile I see:
    Ay, and thy doom I guess.
He can well love thee.
    Be a Princess."</p>

</div>

<p>"My minstrel grows humorous," said the
Duke. "But disregarding that chartered

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

libertine's nonsense-rhymes, will you tell us
your story?"</p>

<p>"I have two stories."</p>

<p>"One true and one false?" asked a laughing
lady who sat by my side, and had been
doing her worst to make me eat all the fruit
within reach.</p>

<p>"Both true," I said.</p>

<p>"<i>Both?</i>" said the Duke.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the story of the man
without the shadow?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," cried a dozen voices in my neighbourhood;
"tell it, please."</p>

<p>"It is brief enough," I said. "A man
who wanted money, sold his soul to the
Devil in exchange for his shadow."</p>

<p>"The Devil!" said the Duke de l'Amour.
"Who is this Devil that buys souls?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried my sprightly neighbour,
the Marquise de la Folie, "and what are
souls?"</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

<p>I felt strongly disposed to swear. Here
had I merely designed to illustrate my
duplex position by reference to this old
German legend, and I encountered this benighted
ignorance. That the Marquise knew
nothing about the soul was conceivable;
but that the Duke had no acquaintance with
the Devil! This was too much. I could
not lecture this gay and gallant company on
comparative mythology. O how I wished
Max M&uuml;ller there!&mdash;or should have wished,
only I did not hear of him till afterwards.
I fear my length of pause was almost impolite.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," I said, "I am glad you know
nothing of the Devil; he is not worth explaining
to you, I can quite understand his
being unknown in Mars, as the wind never
blows from the east in this planet."</p>

<p>"But you have not told me about souls,"
said the loquacious little Marquise. "Have

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

they anything to do with the east wind
too?"</p>

<p>"I think they may have," I made reply.
"They are uncomfortable things to have
about you. They ask awkward questions&mdash;whether
you have laughed too much, drunk
too much, made love too much, kissed the
wrong man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was interrupted.</p>

<p>"Prince," said a lady on the other side,
the Comtesse Dudu, "you can do nothing too
much if you like it, and to kiss the wrong
man is impossible. Therefore, I think that to
have a soul must be extremely inconvenient."</p>

<p>Everyone fully assented to this, and I,
not wishing to make myself ridiculous,
drank a goblet of wine in the Countess's
honour.</p>

<p>"But the story, Prince," said the Duke,
presently; "or the two stories. Come."</p>

<p>"I was going to describe myself as a man

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

with two shadows. Now, shall I tell you
one or both, or shall I invent a romance
that is neither one nor the other?"</p>

<p>The lights were blazing in the Hall Anadyomene
by this time, though we had taken
our seats long before sunset. The festival
was growing almost too rapid in movement.
Luckily for the earthy brain of the Prince
de la Terre, there was plenty of Mars water
at hand, and I drank quarts of that restorative
fluid. O for a flask of it now!</p>

<p>"A romance!" cried the Troubadour,
who sat near. "The Prince may give us
as many true stories as he likes afterwards."</p>

<p>"The ladies had better vote," said the
Duke, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Unanimously did those gay creatures
prefer fiction to truth. I scarce know what
made me rejoice thereat, or why my
thoughts were fixed on that stern statue of
Herakles, which stood in front of the portal

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

of the Ch&acirc;teau Venus. But I began to
invent, to recount:</p>

<p>"Long ago, in my boyhood, I was deemed
beautiful&mdash;ladies, please not to laugh!
Age and much travel cause great differences;
and, if I am a Prince, I have the satisfaction
of being a very ugly one."</p>

<p>At this point I received the rapturous
applause of the assemblage.</p>

<p>"When I was a mere child, there was a
long voyage to be undertaken for some
purpose I never quite understood; but all
the princes of our country were going, and
I desired to go, for the pleasure of change.
As no danger was apprehended, my father
allowed this, putting me under the charge
of a cousin, who was considered the strongest
man and bravest soldier of that time:
we might not think so much of him now.</p>

<p>"We sailed many leagues over the violet
sea. We saw strange sights. The beautiful

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

children of the deep came to the surface
to gaze upon us. After numerous
days, coming to an island covered with
trees, we anchored in a sweetly silent bay,
and boats went ashore for fresh water. My
cousin let me come in his boat. He did the
work of a dozen other men. He pulled
through the tide like lightning, was first
ashore, and while he filled his casks I wandered.</p>

<p>"Up a narrow wood-path, covered with
anemone and cyclamen, I went loitering. A
soft breath was on my cheek. My name
was whispered sweetly in front of me. On
I went: the path wound: I thought nothing
of return. At length I reached a deep
clear pool, and, being warm, thought I
would bathe. When ready to dive, it
seemed as if I could see the forms of nymphs
beneath the water. Still I sprang. I
never rose to the surface. Nymphs there

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

were, hundreds of them; and they held me
below; and though for long days I could
hear my cousin's mighty voice shouting my
name through the woods of the island, I
was unable to extricate myself, and he went
away in terrible grief."</p>

<p>Here I paused.</p>

<p>"What next?" said the gay Marquise.
"You are not under water among nymphs
now. You are above water in the Ch&acirc;teau
Venus. How did you get away? To how
many nymphs did you make love? Are
nymphs at all like women, or are they
chillier, living in ponds instead of
boudoirs, and eating frogs instead of Strasbourg
pies? Ah, and besides, what became
of your cousin? He is a grand figure, that
water-carrying giant, who grew hoarse in
crying your name along the shores of the
island."</p>

<p>"Madame," laughed the Duke, "how

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

many questions you ask in a breath! Which
shall Monsieur answer first?"</p>

<p>"The cousin first," she said in silver
syllables.</p>

<p>"<i>The cousin first!</i>" cried a strange harsh
echo at the outer end of the Hall Anadyomene.
Rising, I saw a gaunt man in a red
headdress, without a coat, carrying a pike,
and apparently leading others of the same
kind.</p>

<p>THAT Herakles .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that sheer strength of
the world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. falsifies the saying here
quoted. Politicians are too apt to judge the
demiurgic demi-god by his foot only.
Twelve labours wrought he, and he wrought
them well. The myth of the past is the
prophecy of the future. When the glorious
son of Zeus and Alkmene, the god that was
also man, went through those twelve labours
of his, it was not without significance. When
he slew the lion of Nemea, he slew

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

tyranny. When he killed the nine-headed
Hydra of Lerna, he put an end to the Cabinet
Ministers. Say not there were no such
animals in days of Herakles: closets and
cabinets were early institutions, and the
idea of government in a corner came at
once when kings grew too weak to govern
for themselves in the broad light of day.
Corner cupboard politics were not invented
by the modern Whigs. When Herakles put
an end to the stag at Arcady, and the boar
of Erymanthus, it is clear that he was assumed
to be dealing with minor rascals:
while nothing could be more intelligible
than his cleansing the stables of Augeas
(monarch of red tape), and his destruction
of the birds of Stymphalus, the
government clerks of the period. Poseidon's
bull can clearly prefigurate nothing
save John Bull's fleet, which the Herakles
of England will rescue from idiotic

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

management. Whether Diomed's mares
may mean cynical literature, or Hippolyte's
girdle the decadence of chastity, or the oxen
of the Red Island the advance in the price
of beef, I know not. The old myths should
be read leisurely, curiously, carefully. As
to the Hesperides, we all know what that
must mean: our Herakles, master of might,
will show the children of beauty who have
remained for so long a time in their cherished
gardens of delight, that he, half god half
man, is greater than they. Shall it be?
Shall the brain of the common folk awake
amid the first race of the world. Will the
daughters of Hesperis receive the unconquerable
son of Alkmene? And if so, will he
drag from the mysterious gate the three-headed
dog of hell?</p>

<p>The gay and gallant chevaliers of the
Ch&acirc;teau Venus fought nobly that night.
They were overpowered by multitude.

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

The innumerable republican came to the
front, and his bludgeon was too much for
the rapier of the gentleman. The story is
old&mdash;the collision is inevitable. The
Ch&acirc;teau Venus disappeared before the giant
force attacking it.</p>

<p>And I? Well, I did not meddle with
the quarrel. I might perchance have done
so had there been a lady in the case; but I
had not been long enough in the Ch&acirc;teau
Venus to fall desperately in love. So,
when there was a general scrimmage, and
rapier and bludgeon came face to face, I
proceeded on my adventures. Mars was
not <i>my</i> planet: why should I trouble myself
about its politics?</p>

<p>Wherefore, escaping quietly from the
Ch&acirc;teau, onward I went. It was a delicious
night, and its coolness gave me
pleasure indescribable. The breath of a
summer midnight is second only to the

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

breath of the woman you love. It seems as
if all sweetness of stars and flowers, all
fragrance of mysterious waters mirroring
the moon, were condensed into that midnight
breath. It is the odour of the goddess
of Earth. It is the kiss of Demeter,
our immortal mother, whose lips are as
loving and whose breasts as full of milk as
when Adam and Eve were babies.</p>

<p>Leaving rouge and noir to fight it out at
the Ch&acirc;teau Venus, I went on my journey.
Early as it was in the morning, I found a
companion. He was an elderly gentleman,
with a broad forehead and dust-coloured
spectacles. He was leaning over a five-barred
gate when I first encountered him,
apparently awaiting the sunrise. His first
remark was brief:</p>

<p>"Eggs!"</p>

<p>I pulled up and surveyed him. He did
not look a maniac. I had reverent reminiscences

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

of my grandmother. I gave the old
gentleman an encouraging smile.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he cried&mdash;"have I found a disciple?
Is there a man capable of understanding
that egg is epigram? Look at a
series of eggs, from a wren to an ostrich's.
Can life be packed into shapes more beautiful?
They are existence in essence. Look
at this, sir," he took an egg from his
pocket&mdash;"that's a nightingale. That's
music. Here's another. That's a jackdaw.
That's fun. By-the-way," he exclaimed,
going off at a tangent, "do you like spiders?
I'm awfully fond of spiders!&mdash;they are such
mathematical animals! Here's one&mdash;ah!
come along, old boy!&mdash;he's generally got a
cobweb in my hat!"</p>

<p>He took off his hat, and there was a very
comfortable spider upon it.</p>

<p>"I believe I have taught that fellow to
improve his webs," said my eccentric

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

acquaintance. "I am told that on the
planet Earth there is an island called England,
which contains a school styled Cambridge,
which every year produces a great
mathematician, described as a Senior
Wrangler. I think if I could get to that
planet, my spider would be a Senior
Wrangler!"</p>

<p>"Very likely," I remarked, remembering
how fond the Marquis de la Place was of
spiders. By the way, Mr. Darwin ought to
take this matter into serious consideration.
The greatest neoteric mathematician had a
mania for devouring the most mathematical
of insects.</p>

<p>"Now where are you going?" asked my
new comrade. "Have you any particular
project?"</p>

<p>"None in the world," I answered. "I
am a traveller, without design or destiny. I

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

am quite willing to encounter whatsoever
happens."</p>

<p>"Very good," he said. "I am carefully
examining the strange animals that inhabit
this planet, intending by-and-by to write a
very full and complete treatise on the zoology
of the Solar System. It is rather curious that,
so far as I have investigated the question,
the fauna and flora of the various planets
differ very widely. I have not yet come to
Earth in the course of my tour; when I do
there will be many novelties, as I am informed.
But I never take hearsay evidence.
I have resolved to describe no animal that I
have not actually seen. It takes some time,
but I like good honest work."</p>

<p>"You must have been for a long time engaged
in this pursuit," I said.</p>

<p>"About three thousand years," he replied.
"It does not seem long. Look here. I see
a bird or a butterfly. I watch it all day

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

long. I discover its habits. Often I succeed
in taming it; there are many wild creatures
of the element that come to me as readily as
if I were one of themselves. This is because
I reason as little as possible, and rely mainly
on my instincts."</p>

<p>"You think we have instincts?" I said,
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Think? I know it. Reason is a capital
thing. Reason teaches you, after a few interviews
with the birchrod, that the side of
a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is
equal to the radius of that circle. A bee
makes the hexagon without mathematical
guidance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and makes honey as well.
Instinct beats reason there, at any rate. Ha,
ha! I should like to see any mathematical
biped who could make honey."</p>

<p>My new acquaintance and I moved forward
together. We were in a lonely part
of the country. It seemed almost virgin

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

turf. The birds and insects and flowers were
new to me. There were strange resemblances
between them. Birds which looked
like roses on the wing; flowers that looked
like birds at rest. My friend the naturalist
was in a state of high delight.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful planet," he exclaimed.
"It beats all the rest that I have tried.
I have serious thoughts of remaining here
for the rest of my existence. Change is
charming; but one gets tired in time, and I
think there is enough material here for
the investigation of a life-time."</p>

<p>Thus spake the ancient enthusiast. He
rather bored me. It has been my fault, in
all planets, to be somewhat easily bored. I
said,</p>

<p>"If you are not tired of birds and bees, I
am. I like men and women. Good morning."</p>

<p>And rudely I strode away at a great pace,

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

determined to escape from this man of
science. Hang science! Useful in its results,
it is confoundedly unpleasant in its elements.
One gets very weary of the anatomy of life.</p>

<p>Evenglome fell upon lake and hill. It was a
lovely day. I was alone amid a silent glen,
where there seemed absolute and perfect
solitude. Not a sound reached me on the
soft south wind. I had been ascending for
some time a slow and gradual slope, treading
grass that was cool to the foot, inhaling fragrance
of flowers more delicious than
jessamine, stephanotis, cyclamen, hyacinth.
Every footstep crushes these lovely blooms,
made brilliant by the pyrogen of Mars.</p>

<p>At the head of that glade was One Tree.
That was the noblest tree I ever saw. It
belonged, I should say, to the oak tribe,
but its leaves were larger than even those
of the Canadian scarlet oak. Its height, I
should think, was about a thousand feet.

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

Its girth, I measured, stretching my arms:
it took me about fifty such stretches, each of
which may be roughly put at between six
and seven feet.</p>

<p>This glorious tree would have more completely
fascinated me in its solitary beauty
but for the splendour of its situation. It
stood at the very top of the hill. A steep
gorge ran down toward a dark dim lake
below. Great cliffs surrounded this mysterious
mere. I sat in the shadow of this
stupendous tree, and gazed down upon the
dark basin of granite. There was no sound,
no movement, till suddenly an eagle, whose
nest was evidently high in the branches of
the great tree, swam out into the clear air,
hovered a moment high above the dark
yet lucid lake, and then dropped sheer into
the water, picking up a huge fish, which he
bore off to his eyry.</p>

<p>The way down to the lake, over the

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

greenest imaginable turf, was as steep as the
side of a Westmorland fell. I could not for
a long time decide whether it was worth
while to descend that slope. Something in
my mental instinct seemed to say "Go!"
and at last I obeyed the impulse, and went
down. It was hard work, for the steep
hill was scarce practicable, save for a mountaineer;
but I dug my heels into the grass,
and got safely to the bottom. When I
arrived there, I found a level lawn around
the lake's margin, white with mushrooms.
I am curiously fond of mushrooms. So I
sat on the grass, and made a delicious
supper. Nothing like the fresh mushroom
of the hills and downs and fells. It made
me think of Earth again.</p>

<p>So, moreover, did another incident. I
thought I would have a swim in the cool
water of this mysterious solitary lake.

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

When I got out a few hundred yards, I
beheld something swimming toward me.
To get a sight of what it was, I trod water.
It was a big dog. He soon overtook me,
though I am a swift swimmer, on my way
ashore; and when I talked to him, he clearly
made up his mind to adopt me as a master.
He looked at me with friendly, intelligent
eyes. Next to a woman's eyes, there are no
eyes like a dog's.</p>

<p>I dried myself in the warm Mars air, and
dressed amid the flowers of cyclamen that
fringed the lake. My new friend looked at
me in friendly fashion. He had manifestly
made up his mind that I was responsible
for his future welfare. I did not in the
least degree object. The men and women
of this planet soon gave up their friendship:
it occurred to me the dog's might be more
trustworthy. So, sitting by the margin of

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

the mere, I had a quiet colloquy with Big
Dog.</p>

<p>"Where shall we sleep to-night?" I said
to myself and him.</p>

<hr/>

</div>

<p>WHERE to sleep? It was a question
that never need worry one in Mars.
The veriest pauper cannot starve with pyrogen
in both air and water, with fruit and
flowers that are full of sustenance. At the
same time, it is rather pleasant to get into
quiet quarters, and this was my idea on the
present occasion. My canine friend seemed

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

quite to comprehend what I wanted. He
went along the side of the lake at a canter,
with tail erect, turning round at intervals
to invite me forward, and assure me that I
should not regret following his lead. Always
a believer in dogs, I took him at his
word, and was in no degree surprised when
I found myself at the door of a thorough
tavern snuggery, which bore the name of
The Hut, and was niched into the granite
wall around this marvellous lake&mdash;this
wilder Wastwater of Mars.</p>

<p>Big Dog and I walked up to the door.
The innkeeper grinned at us as if he loved
us, and suggested lake trout for supper.
There must, I suppose, be an Ireland in
Mars, for this man was as decided an Irishman
as if he had kissed the Blarney stone.
And, ochone! his wife and his daughter!
Now his wife couldn't be more than thirty:
and his daughter was about fifteen: a strapping

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

creature for the age; and, good faith,
they were like two sisters.</p>

<p>I had my lake trout for supper, and after
it a rump steak, with oyster sauce. I have,
I think, already mentioned that Mars oysters
invariably contain pearls, but I forget whether
I remarked that oysters are <i>always</i> in season
in that planet. Such is the case, and it
is one reason why I like it.</p>

<p>The Hut was very snug. Mike, the landlord,
was evidently a Galway man, with a
touch of Lever and Lover about him. He
produced, in the course of the evening,
some whiskey odorous of the turf, that
never could have paid duty, if the barbarism
of whiskey duty could have existed in the
princess of planets. He sang over his whiskey
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">" 'Twas to the planet Mars
    There came a wandering stranger,
Pleasantest of stars,
    Where love is void of danger.
<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->Here he came and said,
    'I'm the man that's wittiest,
And I mean to wed
    The girl that is the prettiest.
            Now, my sweet,
        Ere jealous fancy rankles,
            Show your dancing feet&mdash;
        Show your deer-like ankles.'</p>

<p class="stanza">"So the stranger sang:
    All the girls came running,
For the rumours rang
    Of his wondrous cunning.
Peggy showed her breast;
    Ella showed her shoulder;
Some among the rest
    Grew a trifle bolder.
            'Ah! he cries.
        Well I know my own love;
            She shows her eyes;
        Their light's enough alone, love.' "</p>

</div>

<p>Barney Brallaghan in Mars! What next?
Ah! 'tis a planet wherein one doesn't expect
any logical or continuous <i>next</i>. This is the
charm of it. Calculate what is sure to happen&mdash;it
won't. I like Mars.</p>

<p>And I also liked Kathleen, Mike's daughter,

<!-- vol 2 page 221 -->

a merry girl, who fell in love with Big
Dog on the instant. I wish I could sketch
Kathleen. She was a big lump of a girl,
with short curly hair, and merry eyes, and
a wide laughing mouth, and a freckled face,
and strong red arms, that were meant for
work, and short petticoats, that revealed
stalwart red legs which seemed to need no
concealment. She was barefooted; her hair
was a bunch of fuzziness; her eyes were
immoderately funny. She'd a right musical
voice for all that, an inheritance, probably,
from her father; and I confess I was delighted
when she sang me a song to the tune
of <i>Peg of Limavaddy</i>.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">    "Tell me, if you can,
Where's the scene so rich in
    Fun, since Earth began,
As an Irish kitchen?
    Here the baby crows;
Here the girls get frisky;
    Here the master knows
Where to find his whiskey.
<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->    Here the stranger who
Of Ireland may be scorner,
    Wet and tired and blue,
Finds a cosy corner.</p>

<p class="stanza">    "Burns the fire of peat;
Laugh the lasses merry;
    Ah! their lips more sweet
Than perry are, or sherry.
    Treat them well, I crave,
Even though a poet:
    If you misbehave,
I' faith, they'll let you know it.
    An Irish maiden's waist
Was not made for folly:
    Nobody more chaste,
Though nobody more jolly.</p>

<p class="stanza">    "I would never take
A kiss from any stranger.
    I, for love's own sake,
Would go through direst danger.
    Here I sit and sew,
Putting many a stitch in,
    But fair dreams will glow,
In the old inn-kitchen.
    And I think, think I,
One tires of Larry and Thady;
    O will nobody try
To make Kathleen a lady?"</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

<p>As Kathleen sang this curious song I
looked round the room. The old inn-keeper
dozed in his elbow-chair, with a glass of
whiskey on a round table by his side. His
wife, on the opposite side of the fire, was
half asleep. Kathleen was kneeling on a
fragment of hearthrug, with her hand on
Big Dog's curly mane, as she sang her song.
The scene was amazingly characteristic.
Kathleen especially, bare armed and legged,
with the shortest of petticoats, was a
thoroughly original figure. I remember
that I shut my eyes to think over the situation.</p>

<p>When I opened them, that situation was
changed. The room was no longer an inn
kitchen, but an oak-wainscoted parlour of
the most ancient style. Black was the oak,
lofty the wainscot, wondrously carven the
ceiling. Mike was an elderly gentleman, of
aristocratic guise; Mike's lady was a pretty

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

patrician, with diamonds on her white neck;
Mike's daughter, Kathleen, was exactly the
Kathleen I had seen when I closed my eyes,
but with the whitest skin, and pearls in her
hair, and grace in every movement. Her
skirts had lengthened, but her eyes were as
bright as ever. Only Big Dog was unchanged.
I don't know whether he understood
that something had happened, but he
left Kathleen, and came and laid his huge
tawny head upon my knee.</p>

<p>Then I thought to myself, is this fine
fellow a dog, or is he Proteus himself in
canine guise? The old Greek legends
came back to me with marvellous distinctness.
I saw that old man of the sea beneath
the shining marble cliffs of Earth's
most lovely islands, sought (too often
vainly) by those who desired the aid of his
prophetic power. Verily I was now in a
Protean planet, where I could only resign

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

myself to my destiny, and regard the whole
phantasmagoria with as much calmness as I
could command. After all there are transformation
scenes recorded in all the mythologies
of Earth. After all, there is no transformation
more marvellous than that of a
baby into a man, than that of a man into a
bodiless spirit. Who could guess the fluttering
Psyche, the gauzy fly of summer,
from caterpillar or chrysalis? Who would
dream of swift flight and sweet music hidden
in the egg that is fated to change to
merle or mavis? If the wonders of Earth
are innumerable, why need I be amazed
that there are countless marvels in other
orbs?</p>

<p>While I meditated, my host and hostess
were still dozing; but Kathleen, rising
from the lion-hide which lay before the
fragrant wood-fire, went silently to the
table, and filled me a Venice glass of ruddy

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

wine from a silver jug. She gave me a
gay look, placing finger on lip, to indicate
that her father and mother might as well
sleep on. I took the hint, and the wine.
It was of some vintage quite unknown to
me, with a fragrant bouquet, like the scent
of lilies-of-the-valley, and a fresh clear
flavour, that reminded me of the mountain
strawberry. It had an instantaneous effect
on the brain, causing the faculties to grow
apprehensive and forgetive.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you?" she said, "the
secrets of this place? It is the Cave of
Transformation. We are never long the
same."</p>

<p>Leaving the old folk to their doze by the
fire, Kathleen touched a spring, which
opened an unseen door in the panel, and I
and the dog followed her through a long
stone passage in an imperfect light. It was
a winding corridor, and seemed to be endless;

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

but Kathleen tripped gaily in front,
singing nonsense verses to the air of "The
Groves of Blarney."</p>

<p>Presently we reached a flight of steps,
and the light grew less indistinct, and we
ascended the lofty marble stairway. Brighter
grew the light from above, until it rose to a
radiance like that of Earth's electric lamps
as we reached the platform on the top. On
this landing stood a tall man, with a drawn
sword in his hand, and a lion motionless
beside him. He was prepared evidently to
bar my way. Looking at Kathleen, I saw
that she also had in her hand a sword,
which she gave me with a smile. In an
instant we were engaged in mortal combat,
while Big Dog flew fiercely at the lion. I
had no chance of rescuing the poor fellow
from his unequal antagonist, for my opponent
gave me as much as I could do. He
was as strong as Belzoni, and fenced as

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

skilfully as Angelo. But a passionate faith
in successful adventure had seized me, and
at last, with an upward lunge, that is so
dangerous in its failure that few dare try it,
I ran him right through the throat. He fell
instantly. To my surprise Big Dog was
also a victor&mdash;his feline foe lay panting in
death.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Kathleen. "My wine
gave strength to your wrist and keenness to
your eye. Let us leave those carcases behind,
and make our way on."</p>

<p>Vast double doors of malachite swung
open as we advanced, and I saw a lofty hall
that seemed crowded with life. The whole
floor was covered with groups of strangely-dressed
people of various countries, and
classes, all joyous and brilliant; there was
music somewhere of the most rapturous
rhythm, but I saw no orchestra. The hall,

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

so immeasurable that it seemed to me Saint
Peter's at Rome might have stood within,
leaving ample space every way, was lighted
from the centre of the roof by an enormous
diamond, impregnated with pyrogen. Great
trees covered with marvellous blooms stood
in all the niches; beautiful birds sang on
their branches, or drank at the innumerable
fountains that cooled the sultry air.</p>

<p>"There are old friends of yours here,"
said Kathleen, as we walked leisurely
through the brilliant eccentric groups.</p>

<p>Verily I found it so. At a small table by
a fountain there were a group of six, different
enough, yet in eager conversation.
The subject, as I heard, was matrimony. A
prim elderly gentleman in spectacles (known
in his youth as C&oelig;lebs) was declaring
that he had never known happiness till he
found the wife he so long had sought; she

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

sat beside him, smiling approval, in a
dowdy dress much too short for her, and
her face reminded me of Mistress Hannah
More. Close beside them, sipping sherbet
and placidly listening, was a man of youthful
beauty, in the Eastern dress&mdash;it was
Prince Zeyn Alasnam, and in his hand he
held the slight fingers of the pure and lovely
Princess whom he valued far more than
his eight golden statues. In quaint contrast
with these were the other two; a
charming Greek girl, looking into the olive
face of a daring cynical dark-eyed young
Spaniard, who drank his wine freely, and
suddenly broke into song:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O Madrid, thou pleasant city,
    Where such merry deeds I did!
Damsels gay, duennas witty,
    I have known in thee, Madrid.
Owner of the ninth gold statue,
    If you'd keep a quiet brain,
Let no girl throw glances at you
    In the throbbing heart of Spain.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

<p class="stanza">"Island of the pirate-cutter,
    Where foes frown and dear eyes smile!
There's no poet who could utter
    Half thy beauty, perilous isle.
Dingy C&oelig;lebs, drab and drowsy,
    From your prosy nonsense cease,
What care I for females frowzy,
    Who have won the Flower of Greece?"</p>

</div>

<p>"The Don seems as audacious as ever," I
said to Kathleen.</p>

<p>"And Haidee as pretty," she replied.</p>

<p>We passed on. Four persons of the male
sex formed the next group that attracted
my notice. They were close to a very
spirited statue of the god Pan, placed on a
superbly-carved pedestal, around which the
delicate hand of the sculptor had placed
numerous figures of satyrs and fauns and
flying nymphs. On a table were great
piles of salt meats and fish, with plates of
chives, leeks, onions, garlic, eschalots,
flanked by several huge bottles of wine

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

The figure seated by this table might well
draw attention. He was of gigantic stature
and noble countenance, and wore royal
robes; the only anomaly in his costume was
a hempen rope, by way of girdle. Opposite
him stood a handsome man in the dress of
a student, who was turning out his pockets
in a ludicrous pantomime, to show he was
penniless. The royal giant laughed and
drank, then looked around at a short stout
Spanish peasant, who stood a little way
back, and who said,</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, money is dross, therefore
it becomes not the dignity of princes to
retain it. They should bestow it on the
viler sort."</p>

<p>Then the fourth person in the assembly, a
French doctor, who looked infinitely learned,
said, like an oracle,</p>

<p>"Whether we have money or have not,
this is the best of all possible worlds."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

<p>"Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire," I thought
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "<i>πανουργία</i>. The governors of Salmagondin
and Barataria in company. Verily the
Prime Ministers of Earth should be here to
learn lessons of politics."</p>

<p>After all, I doubt much whether Gladstone,
Bismarck, MacMahon, and the rest,
have sufficient intuition to learn much from
Pantagruel, Panurge, Sancho Panza, and
Pangloss. The right Premier of England is
Pangloss: the right Premier of Germany is
Panurge: but what is to be done with the
other two? Is there any country on Earth
worthy to be ruled by Pantagruel? How
could he manage Ireland? Would he make
a swift end of Jesuit and Fenian, of murderer
and libeller?</p>

<p>Another group of four, on divans, lazily
drinking coffee. One a girl of the Dudu
type, her eyes half open, her arms thrown
above her fair-tressed head .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Brynhild

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

the sleeper, whom Sigurd awoke. Over
this Teuton giantess drooped fronds of fern,
and it seemed each moment as if she would
drop back into that dreamless slumber of
centuries, whence she was awakened by a
kiss. Old habits are hard to conquer. When
one has slept a century or two, a single kiss
has scarcely sufficient awakening power.
The result of a continuous series might be
different.</p>

<p>A couple of unquestionable Dutchmen,
Peter Klaus and Rip Van Winkle, lay half
awake on two other divans; the fourth was
occupied by a man with a glorious Greek
face, poetic and philosophic. He also seemed
almost in a trance; but, when I passed,
he fixed his eyes on me. Then suddenly
he arose, left his companions, and came to
where I stood, accosting me. I turned
round to look for Kathleen; she had
vanished in the innumerous crowd, and

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

was untraceable. Big Dog kept close.</p>

<p>"I fell asleep one summer afternoon,"
said the Greek, "in a cavern of the happy
Cretan hills, and slept fifty-seven years. I
awoke refreshed&mdash;I awoke wiser. While
thus I slept Zeus rained upon me knowledge.
When I came back among a people that remembered
me not&mdash;how should they?&mdash;I
could teach them things of which they had
never dreamed. As sunshine brings to a
man health, passing into him through the
pores of his skin, so Apollo the Far Worker
had drenched my sleeping spirit with the
light of thought. Do you guess what I
learnt there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "O Cretan. You
learnt that, when a man cannot think, God
thinks for him."</p>

<p>"True," said Epimenides. "Now tell me,
are you awake or in a dream? Look across
this hall of wonder, and say."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 236 -->

<p>I threw myself on a couch and looked
around. Assuredly it was a hall of wonder.
No pen could describe the gay groups that
fluttered through it. Mephistopheles was
looking for Faust; ugly Riquet with the
Tuft was good-humouredly searching for the
Princess on whom he was destined to confer
wit and beauty; step-mother Grognon, armed
with a birch-broom was lamely running
after pretty Graciosa, who with dishevelled
hair was seeking her protector, Percinet.
Myriads of such legends were enacted before
my astonished gaze.</p>

<p>And on the walls there were great pictures,
gloriously painted. I beheld Avalon.
I heard Arthur say,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"I wylle wende a lytelle stownde
In to the vale of Aveloone,
A whyle to hele me of my wounde."</p>

</div>

<p>O the wondrous orchard bloom of that
strange solitary place whither the ladies of

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

old romance brought with many tears the
wounded swordless king! I have seen Mr.
Millais paint apple blossoms since, but he
could not touch the artist of Mars. A great
Minster rose amid the dim deep orchards:
and they laid Arthur in the tender grass beneath
a most ancient tree: and soft hands
tended him, and sweet song rose around
him.</p>

<p>As I gazed that picture vanished. In its
place came an admirable sketch of Captain
Lemuel Gulliver, in the famous City of Lilliput,
with crowds of pigmies gazing up at the
monster. The artist had given Gulliver an
air of contempt for these small people, that
would have done credit to a Prime Minister.
Turning the other way, I saw a picture that
made me shudder. I saw myself lying dead
at Beau Sejour, with Lucy kneeling by my
side. This strange picture also vanished, and
in its place I saw two cradles with a baby in

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

each, and the mother and nursemaids
watching them. The mother's face seemed
to me to have in it something familiar.</p>

<p>Then I answered the question of Epimenides
with a counter question,</p>

<p>"What difference is there, O Cretan, between
being awake and being in a dream?
That surely you must have learnt during the
fifty-seven years you unconsciously inhaled
or imbibed the wisdom of the universe. I
retort on you your inquiry. Were you awake
or dreaming all that time in that Cretan
cavern? Were you awake or dreaming when
you afterwards set up a respectable household
in Crete, but brought your pretty
daughter Iphis up as a boy instead of a girl?
Come: you are a philosopher: define being
awake: define being in a dream."</p>

<p>Epimenides looked slightly puzzled. He
said,</p>

<p>"There is a friend of mine who could

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

help us through this bit of metaphysic. You
have heard of Merlin?"</p>

<p>"O yes. He is wisest of all you lovers
of sleep. He dreams of Vivian under the
great oaks of Broceliande.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">' O, happy happy Merlin!
    Afar in the forest deep,
To thee alone of the sons of men
    Gave a woman the gift of sleep?' "</p>

</div>

<p>"Let us leave this, and go to him," said
the Cretan sleeper. He and I and the mighty
mastiff at once left the hall by an entrance
near us, and passed into what seemed a new
world.</p>

<p>Miles of open green, virgin turf, with
enormous trees at wide intervals. It was
now just sunrise. Although I had not slept
I felt sleepless. The Greek and the dog
looked far wearier than I felt: but as to
Epimenides, he had contracted an early
habit of sleeping.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

<p>The sunrise, a wondrous vision of colour
and form unutterable, wherein any poet
would imagine a myriad pictures, wherein
any wise man would see the handiwork of
God, slanted lovingly through the broad-leafed
oaks, turning; all their innumerable
dewdrops into diamonds and sapphires and
rubies and emeralds. Songs of birds filled
the air with melody. Else there was an
awful hush upon the forest, a silence that
might be felt, a solitude that a guilty soul
might dread. Often have I thought that
any man who had committed a great crime
should be in mortal fear if he went anywhere
alone.</p>

<p>Put the hypothesis. I will not take
murder into count: but say you have built
your prosperity on fraud .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say you have
ruined a girl for your mere pleasure. Can
you walk alone into a quiet wood, and tread
upon the carpet of last year's leaves, and

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

have no fear of meeting, in that beautiful
yet awful solitude, the Almighty Avenger?
Perhaps I put the question thoughtlessly;
perhaps the men who commit such abominations
are incapable of belief in God, and
therefore incapable of fearing him. Pillory
or the cat was meant for them.</p>

<p>Merlin, an aged man, seven feet high,
with a white beard that fell below his waist,
leant against an oak-tree, with a crutch of
ivory in his right hand. On one finger of
that hand burnt a light-giving carbuncle. He
looked at us, and said,</p>

<p>"Welcome to the forest."</p>

<p>"Our friend, just fresh from Earth," said
Epimenides, "wants to know whether he is
awake or in a dream."</p>

<p>"No," said I, promptly, "that is not a fair
way of putting it. You asked me which. I
ask you, in return, whether there is any

<!-- vol 2 page 242 -->

difference between waking and dreaming?
If so, what is that difference?"</p>

<p>There was a humorous twinkle in the
British prophet's eye; he saw that the Cretan
was puzzled.</p>

<p>"It does not matter to me," I went on,
"whether I am awake or asleep. In either
case I see certain persons and places, and
certain adventures happen to me. In either
case I enjoy existence, and always mean to
enjoy existence. Still, as a mere ontological
problem, it might be worth while to ascertain
whether there is any difference between
sleeping and waking; and, if so, whether we
are asleep or awake, we three?"</p>

<p>"The difference between sleeping and
waking," said Merlin, "is purely imaginary.
I have slept for more than a thousand years,
yet all the time I lived. My mortal presentment
was under the oaks of Broceliande.
My self was in the world, fighting for truth,

<!-- vol 2 page 243 -->

and sighing for love. Have you ever known
the right victorious? Merlin was there!
Have you ever known a wedding of true
love? Merlin was there.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Yes, while the legend made me
    Under great oak-trees sleep,
I was where bright eyes glisten,
    I was where sad eyes weep.</p>

<p class="stanza">'Oft when the happy lover
    Toyed with his lady's hair,
Shadow of loves more ancient,
    Merlin the Seer was there.</p>

<p class="stanza">'Oft when the fierce fight thundered,
    Making the myriads die,
Just for some crowned fool's fancy,
    Merlin the Seer stood by.</p>

<p class="stanza">'Once, when a people trembled,
    Under a poet's power.
Merlin waxed glad, and wondered&mdash;
    Was it the world's last hour?</p>

<p class="stanza">'No: the great world rolls always
    On through the ether deep.
Love! laugh! fight! cheat! swear! quarrel!
    Merlin the Seer will sleep.' "</p>

</div>

<p>I had thrown myself on the turf under

<!-- vol 2 page 244 -->

a great tree; while Merlin broke out into a
mixture of prose and verse, I had closed my
eyes, and was listening. I think I have fairly
reported him. But when his recitative
ceased I opened my eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and behold
he was not there! Neither was Epimenides
of Crete. I was alone in the woodland, save
for Big Dog, who blinked at me when I
awoke, as much as to say,</p>

<p>"I'm very glad those two old bores are
gone. Ain't you?"</p>

<p>I sometimes wish dogs could speak. I
sometimes wish women couldn't. It is,
however, rather difficult to realize a world
of articulate dogs and inarticulate women.
Should we gain anything from the former?
Some of them, in gesture and gaze, make
one believe they must be imprisoned spirits.
On the other hand, suppose the women
silenced. They could not scold, 'tis true,
but then I have known men who liked

<!-- vol 2 page 245 -->

being scolded. And then they couldn't
sing, and they couldn't say witty little
things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such as nobody save a woman
can say, for the wit of a man differs from
the wit of a woman, not in degree, but in
kind; it is the clear keen diamond against
the pure round pearl; it is the foam of the
tide against the sparkle of the fountain.</p>

<p>Big Dog got up, shook himself, and looked
at me, saying, as well as looks can speak,</p>

<p>"Let's go on."</p>

<p>On we went through the free forest.</p>

<p class="small">THE PATH OF PAIN.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>Πόνου μεταλλαχθέντος οἱ πόνοι γλυκεῖς</i>.</p>


<p>MY four-footed friend and I, escaped
from the company of philosophers,
trudged merrily along. It is true that both
Epimenides and Merlin were poets as well
as philosophers, and that both were famous
illustrations of a truth seldom understood&mdash;that
unconscious existence may be as fruitful
as conscious existence. Still the analytic
faculty predominated in each of them;
and I, though admitting the necessity and
the value of that faculty, care not to associate

<!-- vol 2 page 247 -->

with those who possess it. Let my
friends be owners of the synthetic faculty;
let them create, and not destroy. How
seldom has a woman any power of analysis;
but all women of the first force have synthesis&mdash;and
most women of the average. A
girl does not analyse her lover, she creates
him. Often enough she makes a huge
mistake, and forms a hero out of a very
ordinary clod; but sometimes she has power
enough to find in her clod something really
heroic, as the sculptor sees the statue hidden
in his block of marble. A world in which
women were analytical instead of synthetical
is difficult to imagine; I suppose it would
result in absolute Amazonism. Men would
have to give way; the Amazon analyst
would be omnipotent.</p>

<p>Reflective, I walk onward through the vast
woodland, whose character changed as I advanced.
Presently the great umbrageous

<!-- vol 2 page 248 -->

oaks gave way to tortured trees, almost leafless,
which seemed to have been scorched by
lightning&mdash;to great pines broken and splintered
as if an avalanche had fallen on them&mdash;to
blasted melancholy yews, beneath
whose mournful shade hideous funguses
caricatured all the most bestial shapes of
nature. The change from the loveliness of
the open forest to this weird scene made my
spirit sink within me; and I felt that the air
also had changed, that it was dense and turbid
and loaded with evil vapour, that the
light was yellow and dim, that there were
unpleasant influences at work around me.
Wretched reptiles wriggled through the
scanty grass, hissing at Big Dog as he trod
fearlessly among them. But for that noble
dog I should probably have turned back,
and sought the forest again, and tried to get
a breath of air with pyrogen in it. He
maintained my courage, and actually exhilarated

<!-- vol 2 page 249 -->

me by his grand contempt for the
toils of the way. The way had indeed become
toilsome. The path rose slowly,
growing steeper and steeper; as it grew
steeper it also grew less pleasant to the tread,
becoming a mixture of loose sand and sharp
shingle. I began to think I was a fool to
push forward; but Big Dog took the lead
quite merrily; and I resolved to pursue my
journey. The ascent was difficult; the atmosphere
was oppressive; there were hideous
croakings of questionable animals in the
dense bush through which I had to force my
way. Instead of the regal trees to which I
had been accustomed, standing solitary amid
soft green turf, with summits that seemed to
seek the stars, and inhabited by birds of
lovely song, I saw a dense undergrowth of
prickly shrubs, bound together by ropes of
immemorial brier, and haunted by slimy
reptiles with innumerable legs, and hideous

<!-- vol 2 page 250 -->

black insects with stings. I grew athirst,
but had there been a spring should not have
dared to drink&mdash;fearing that it would be
pregnant with miasma.</p>

<p>Long was the toilsome climb up that
steep slope, where huge stones surprised the
foot amid shifting sand; but last the summit
was reached .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the sight I saw I
never shall forget. The path downward
was even a steeper slope; but at its foot
there was a green valley with a stream running
through it, and just beyond there rose
a lofty mountain, its conical peak rosy at this
moment with summer light. I might have
seen it as I ascended the ridge, but the
wearying path prevented my looking forward
or upward. It is in travel as it is in
life; trudge, trudge, trudge through the mud&mdash;or
drudge, drudge, drudge for the muck
they call money&mdash;and your eye will never
look upward. You have no time to seek

<!-- vol 2 page 251 -->

the serene stars, or the mountain-cones that
mingle with the clouds.</p>

<p>How to descend? It was only not perpendicular,
this slope: a nasty shifting sandy
stony soil, treacherous to the foot, I sat
on the ridge meditating, reluctant to break
my neck, and half wishing I had never left
the many pleasant corners of this planet, in
which I might so easily have remained. I
grew melancholy in my loneliness; but Big
Dog put his black muzzle into my hand,
reminding me, in his affectionate way, that I
had at least one friend. So I patted the
old boy, and took heart, yet saw no way of
reaching the lovely valley below without
fracturing every joint of my body.</p>

<p>Suddenly Big Dog barked .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a joyous
eager encouraging bark. I looked up: his
big brown eyes were fixed on something
above us, that looked a mere speck in the sky.
But approaching with incredible swiftness it

<!-- vol 2 page 252 -->

grew vaster in size, and I soon saw it was
an immense eagle, huger far than any condor
that ever screamed around the inaccessible
summits of Andes.</p>

<p>It came straight to where I stood. And
instinct told me that this was my mode of
escape. As it hovered just below me I flung
myself upon it, burying my hands in depth
of feather, and was instantaneously carried
down to the valley below. So swift was
the descent that I was breathless, and could
not have thanked my deliverer if even I had
known the language of the eagles of Mars.
Before I could recover myself the royal bird,
shooting right upward, had become a speck
in the limitless blue.</p>

<p>When I was all right again I looked for
Big Dog. The dear old fellow had scrambled
down the slippery head-long slope, and was
racing across the green to meet me. After
a bark of welcome he sprang into the stream,

<!-- vol 2 page 253 -->

and drank and cooled himself. I also drank:
the wondrous water of Mars restored me on
the instant.</p>

<p>Eager for rest, I lay upon the sweet fresh
turf and slept .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how long I know not.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 2 page 254 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">THE PEAK OF POWER.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>Οὐδὲν α ναύδατον φατίσαιμ᾽ ἄν</i>.</p>

<p>WHEN I awoke, there stood beside me
Cheiron the Centaur .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he who
taught the son of Peleus and the daughter
of Leda. Looking at me with friendly eyes,
he said:</p>

<p>"I have been your companion in another
form. I hope you were satisfied with your
dog. Now I must leave you, only advising
you to climb that mountain. It is the Peak
of Power. Reach its summit, and you will
be fortunate."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 255 -->

<p>He neighed farewell, and cantered away
across the emerald grass. I have not seen
him since.</p>

<p>"So," I thought, "old Cheiron has aided
me in the guise of a dog. I have reason to
be proud. Few men have even known him,
since the great days of the great wars of
old. I will follow his advice, I will scale
that mountain. What next, who knows?"</p>

<p>O how lovely was the loneliness of that
sweet mountain-side! The first belt was
vine, growing wild, yet producing grapes
such as I never saw elsewhere. I afterwards
discovered that the Peak of Power is
a volcano, which accounts for the immense
size and delicious quality of these grapes.
They were a rich crimson, and about the
size of an ordinary egg-plum; a stalwart
porter would stagger beneath a bunch of
them. I walked till eventide through this
fair land of grapes; I saw no one; and,

<!-- vol 2 page 256 -->

when night came, I threw myself on the
turf, and slept a sleep most perfect and profound
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the sleep induced by thorough
weariness of body or of mind. In such
sleep there are no dreams; the immortal
spirit folds its wings and is still; the mortal
body does sweetly, softly, silently, its
healthy easy work. Such sleep hath had
praise from all men, from Sophocles to
Sancho Panza.</p>

<p>Awaking with sunrise, which, in the
atmosphere of Mars, is a sight indescribable
for its splendour, unless indeed I had
plenty of pyrogen, I drank of the brook,
and ate a few giant grapes, and pressed
forward. The next belt of land was studded
with vast chestnut trees, such as &AElig;tna
never saw. Goats frolicked beneath them;
and, at about noon, I reached the encampment
of some goat-herds, and was glad to
accept their free and limitless hospitality. I

<!-- vol 2 page 257 -->

had climbed some miles; I could see many
of the strange places through which I had
passed lying beneath me as if on a map; I
felt tired of this volatile versatile planet,
and was glad to be beneath a great chestnut,
and eat goat's milk cheese and bread of
chestnut flour, and drink a weak, yet most
exhilarant wine, made newly from the
grapes already described. Such entertainment
had I among the goat-herds; and,
when I lay upon the grass thereafter, the
girls fanned me to sleep.</p>

<p>When I started again I came upon clear
moorland .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. short sweet grass that has
seldom felt the foot, and innumerable
varieties of heather and broom and gorse.
Trees gradually dropped away. Wild creatures,
unknown to me, broke out of the
ferns and furze. Birds sang wondrously.
The planet below was a miraculous picture
to me, who had caught the long-sightedness

<!-- vol 2 page 258 -->

of Mars. I pushed on; it was a case of
<i>excelsius</i>, if I may correct American Latin;
and, as I neared the grand pinnacle that
crowned the hill, I saw that I had not yet
got through my hard work.</p>

<p>The final peak was almost an erect cone,
about three hundred feet high, and as
smooth as glass. What was to be done?</p>

<p>I have never known how I attained the
apex of that awful aiguille. There are
times of physical effort so tremendous that
it is only remembered as pure effort; what
happened, and how it happened, perish
from the memory. It was so with me on
this occasion. I reached the keen summit
of the mountain, and that is all that I can
say. When there, I was so worn with the
terrible toil, that I lay awhile .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how
long I know not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and slept upon the
grass. For even on that solitary summit
the grass grew green and soft.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 259 -->

<p>And when I awoke, and looked on leagues
of Mars lying like a map beneath me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
far, far beneath .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I found close at hand
a pure well of that water which stimulates
while it refreshes. So I drank, and having
drunken, felt as if there were no more
troubles in the universe. Place a man on
a mountain peak, and give him water to
drink, with plenty of pyrogen in it, and if
he grumbles at the course of events he
deserves kicking.</p>

<p>Lying on the soft green grass, untrodden
perchance by other foot since the planet
Mars was created, I looked downward and
meditated. Here I was, free to wander
whithersoever I chose, pleasantly surrounded
by strange fantasies, free from any kind of
care; yet there came on me at intervals a
sort of home-sickness, a longing for that
native sphere where man is born to trouble
as the sparks fly upward. Mars is a lovely

<!-- vol 2 page 260 -->

planet, but it has its disadvantages. Creditors
are unknown; scolding wives are unknown;
nobody writes books; nobody reviews
books. The tax-gatherer has not been
invented, nor the bill-discounter, nor the
popular preacher. There are no armies, no
navies, no Parliaments. It is an uncivilized
planet.</p>

<p>Somewhat thus did I muse as I rested on
the summit of the Peak of Power, and looked
down upon the wondrous world below.
I was alone. I looked back upon what
seemed a long residence in Mars, and was
already weary of it. Its phantasmagoria
was unlike the strong stern reality of Earth
life. It had no maddening joys, no bitter
griefs. It was an aesthetic planet.</p>

<p>Here am I, methought, on the summit of
the highest of the hills of Mars. It is loftier
than Mount Blanc, loftier than Chimborazo.
I have got up here, somehow or other, without

<!-- vol 2 page 261 -->

much difficulty. If I had done such a
thing on Earth they would have given me a
pinchbeck medal, or put a lot of letters at the
end of my name. They can't make me illustrious
in that way in Mars, because nobody
has yet invented an alphabet. No
fellow can be F.R.S. in a planet where F
and R and S are as yet unrevealed. I am
safe. And indeed I am all the safer for
being nameless. I left my name behind me
on Earth, and have received no new one
here.</p>

<p>As thus I reflected, high above the ordinary
level of the planet, the day wore towards
evening. It was the loveliest sight I
ever remember to have seen. Far, far below
the lucid lakes of Mars slept amid silent
valleys; villages nestled in happy nooks;
the world was fair, and free from turmoil.
Yet as there I lay and looked upon the
magical scene, something seemed wanting.

<!-- vol 2 page 262 -->

What was it? I have since guessed; it was
the trouble of Earth.</p>

<p>Man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly
upward. If he is set wholly free from care
and annoyance he loses the strength of his
fibre, the fighting power that belongs to him.
A tranquil race may dwell on Mars happily
enough; it is no place for the beings who
commence existence by rebellion and murder.
Believe or disbelieve the antique legends of
Eden's garden, and of the death of Abel by
his brother's hand; they are, at any rate,
profoundly true in essence, as showing the
character of the human race.</p>

<p>Turning from the scene below me, soft
and serene, I looked into the western sky.
There was a spiritual sunset. The clouds
were of colours unimaginable, of forms that
each instant changed. Low in the horizon
there seemed a wondrous city of palaces,
with great trees between them, and winding

<!-- vol 2 page 263 -->

streams&mdash;a sublimated Venice of the sky.
Above this lay a bank of purple light, which
gradually changed to crimson, to rose, to
saffron, to a strange sad grey; and how blue
was the sky behind this mass of colour!
And lo one star!</p>

<p>That silent serene star, glimmering into
stronger light as the chariot of Helios left
its radiant dust behind it in the western sky,
was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Earth. It was my
home. The strange long-sightedness of Mars,
and the luminous power of the pyrogenized
atmosphere, clear as a crystal filled with
light, enabled me to perceive a less star beside
it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the ever-faithful attendant Moon.
As I saw, in the dim undiscoverable distance,
these two planets, I felt upon me
intolerable home-sickness. I thought of the
solid Earth, where things seemed unchangeable.
I thought of the lovely Moon, crescent
or de-crescent, or glorious at the full,

<!-- vol 2 page 264 -->

in whose light so much folly has been sung
and said. The Earth, with all its unquestionable
disadvantages, seemed to me at that
moment more attractive than Mars.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had formed a wish
in Mars. In that orb there seemed nothing
to wish for. Often has it occurred to me,
reflecting on my curious adventures, that, if
the formation of a wish involved its fulfilment,
a good many odd things would happen.</p>

<p>In this case the wish was power. As I
looked on Earth, brightening slowly while
the sunset faded, I wished that I was there
once more. The wish was sudden and

<p>I, EDWARD ELLESMERE, died at
Beau Sejour, on Five Tree Hill, at
seven in the afternoon of the 29th of June,
1840, being Saint Peter's Day, and a Monday.</p>

<p>I, Reginald Marchmont, was born at

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

Marchmont Lodge, Wimbledon, at eleven
in the evening of the 29th of June, 1840,
being Saint Peter's Day, and a Monday.</p>

<p>The interval passed in the planet Mars is
to me utterly inexplicable. I leave it to the
metaphysical reader.</p>

<p>My second experience of the world was
without parallel. I was lying in a cradle in
an airy nursery, lighted from above. I
seemed of a rather red complexion. I
looked around at things in general, having
an unforgotten experience of the world, and
observed that there was another cradle near
me. There were several female folk about.
One of them said, with a fine Irish brogue,
which may be left to the reader's imagination,</p>

<p>"Well, I hope the master's satisfied now.
He wanted a boy, and he's got two! Faith,
it's the height of good luck."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

<p>As I lay there, amid lavendered linen,
the situation dawned on me. I was born
again, without forgetting my past. Most
babies have forgotten everything: I had
forgotten nothing. If my father were to
come and quote Horace to me, I could give
him the next line. But, remembering that
this is a prejudiced age, I decided to keep
very quiet at first. Besides, from the confabulation
of the nurses, it would seem there
was a twin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I wanted to see that
twin. So I turned round in my cradle and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>By-and-by I was awaked by laughter, and
a blue-eyed bright-haired little girl came
dancing into the room. She looked quite a
giantess to me in my cradle; she was three,
at least. She romped about the place right
pleasantly; her turquoise eyes suited her
festucine hair; she laughed and sang and

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

played tricks of all sorts. I, with eyes wide
open in my cradle, studied her philosophically.
I was however very curious to
know what my brother was like, in the
other cradle. Had he any memory of the
past? Or was he merely a common-place
baby?</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Dot, don't you be troublesome,"
says one of the nurses. And Miss
Dot is turned out of the nursery into some
other room, and I fall back upon my pillow
and reflect. I come to the conclusion
that, for reflection, there's nothing like a
pillow.</p>

<p>I pass a lazy easy time of it, alternating
between the soft cradle and the nurse's
lap. Dot comes in and out. Dot is
much interested in her little brothers. Dot
little thinks that one of her little brothers
is quite an old, old man. Dot reminds me

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

of somebody. Now who the devil is it?</p>

<p>O, I know. A great day arrives.
Mamma is well enough to come to the
nursery and look at her twins. Mamma
comes; her husband and her husband's
brother accompany her. Have I seen before
those happy eyes beneath that radiant
hair? Have I not? Why, it is Mavis Lee!
But I, being a baby in a cradle, am perfectly
quiet, and think what fun it will be when
I tell her who I am, some day or other.
Yes, little lovely Mavis Lee has married
somebody .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I am her son. Do I
regret it? Emphatically NO!</p>

<p>As I lay in my cradle that night, I became
ontological and psychological. Mavis
Lee, not long ago, was a little girl that I
petted; now she's Mamma: which view of
her character am I to take? Few places
are more favourable for reflection than a

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

cradle. You pass from the nurse's soft
arms to the sweet sheets amid the basket-work,
and you say to yourself, "I'll leave
prophecies to be solved to-morrow;" that's
if you're an ordinary baby, under ordinary
conditions. But I wanted to work out the
exquisite identity of Mamma and Mavis. It
was soon done.</p>

<p>I wish words could describe my feelings at
this time. Here was I, who had known
Mavis Lee (now Mavis Marchmont) a mere
girl&mdash;and I was a ruddy baby in her mother-lap.
I shared in her affection with my
brother. I was the eldest by an instant&mdash;the
heir, therefore, to the Marchmont business
on the Stock Exchange, which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well,
the less said of that "which" the better.
Even in the cradle, I detested the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Nursery reminiscences become tiresome.

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

Let us move on. My father, with City
cruelty, christened me Reginald, and my
brother Algernon. My Uncle Paul (have I
mentioned my Uncle Paul?) he was senior
wrangler, and wrote Greek iambics like
Sophocles, called me Rex for short. He
didn't shorten Algernon's name; he didn't
much care about Algernon. When he
gave him a nickname, it was "Whiskers."</p>

<p>Could I only remember, with anything
like accuracy, the experience of the cradle,
with perfect knowledge of the past, and
with my dear lovely Mavis for mamma, it
would be an idyl inimitable. There was
the fact&mdash;enough for me&mdash;God had renewed
my youth, and given me to Mavis; she did
not know it. She shall, when the true
time comes.</p>

<p>It was very odd, this general relationship,
which I alone understood. Dear Mavis&mdash;the

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

little girl! Dear Mamma&mdash;so sweet and
kind! A pretty puzzle this. I had to conceal
my knowledge. But the concealment
grew more difficult when I had to deal with
my brother Algy and my sister Kitty. While
I was master of many languages, poor dear
Algy couldn't read. I knew the world,
though I looked a baby; Kitty knew nothing.</p>

<p>To lie in a cradle and gnaw a coral is, I
think, as jolly as any method of wasting
time I know. This I did. I was a marvel
to myself; but Dot and Algy were to me
greater marvels. It seemed incredible that
I alone should possess any recollection of
the world I had left. And where had my
sister come from? Who had she been in the
land she had left? Never did I tire of
speculating on these questions; and the
nursery authorities, surprised at the fact

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

that, while I laughed a great deal, and pondered
a great deal, I never by any chance
cried, pronounced me the best baby they
had ever known. There was, however, one
dissentient&mdash;Nurse Nora, who came from the
isle of the shamrock, and was as full of traditions
and legends as an egg of meat. She
used to tell her English fellow-servants long
stories in a whisper by the cosy nursery fire,
when Kitty had been put to bed, and Algy
and I were supposed to be asleep in our
cradles. I soon found that I required much
less sleep than an ordinary baby like my
brother; and when Nora was tale-telling, I
used to lie with my eyes shut, and listen to
interminable stories of banshees, cluricaunes,
fairy mounds, fairy treasure, and a thousand
other imaginative superstitions of Ireland,
familiar to those who have read Crofton
Croker's charming work.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

<p>One night, as thus I lay, Nora's whisper
was rather lower than ever. She was talking
about me. Little pitchers have long
ears, and I caught all she said.</p>

<p>"That child's a changeling, I know. The
good people have taken away the mistress's
true son, and left one of themselves instead.
O, I should like to try the brewery of
eggshells upon him."</p>

<p>"Why, what's that, Nora?" whispered one
of the girls.</p>

<p>"If you want to know if a child is a
changeling, put a pot on the fire, and fill it
with eggshells and water, and at the same
time put the poker between the bars to get
rod-hot. Stir up the eggshells, and presently
the baby'll cry out, 'What's that you're doing,
nurse?' 'I'm brewing eggshells, my darling,'
says you. Then the fairy will say, 'Well,
I'm nigh a thousand years old, and I never

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

heard of brewing eggshells yet!' Then you
fetch the poker out of the fire, and run at
the creature, and it'll vanish out of window,
and in the cradle you'll find the right baby,
smiling as peacefully as heart could wish."</p>

<p>I could see the English nursemaids&mdash;there
were three&mdash;shuddering with half credulous
fright. I was thinking all the time what
fun it would be if I (who, of course, had as
yet no right to talk) were to make, at the
end of Nora's story, some startling remark.
But my cradle-cogitations had determined me
not to reveal my peculiar condition to any
one&mdash;for a very long time, at least. I was
partly actuated by the conviction that the
world would vote me a lunatic if, when of
sufficient age, I should proclaim the truth
about myself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but chiefly by my desire
to continue as long as possible in this highly
rare, if not unprecedented incognito, and to

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

test thoroughly the effect on a human career
of remembering the career which had gone
immediately before it.</p>

<p>Still Nora's theory was so irresistible that
I could not restrain a smothered laugh; and
the way in which those servant-girls were
startled thereby was amusing. They all
jumped up to look at me. I was lying with
my eyes wide open, calmly gazing on the
ceiling. There were two or three ejaculations
of surprise; but the Irish girl only
shook her head mysteriously, as who should
say, "You see I was right."</p>

<p>I believe the brewery of eggshells would
have been tried, but Mamma was in and out
of the nursery so often that the maids had
no chance of attempting the experiment.
But I could see Nora often gazing at me
with a curious mixture of inquiry and dread.
Evidently that imaginative little Irishwoman

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

had quite made up her mind that I was a
changeling. It is creditable to the well-known
acuteness of the Irish mind that she
at least discovered that there was something
in me different from other babies.</p>

<p>I go on now to the child life which I led
with the kindest of mothers, and Dot the
Second, and Algernon. It was as happy as
health, love, and money could make it. It
was passed, the first part of it, in my father's
house at Wimbledon&mdash;a real mansion, that
he had built himself, and furnished sumptuously.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">CHILD-LIFE.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"The child is father of the man."</p>

</div>

<p>REMINISCENCES of ordinary childhood
in after-life are usually of a vague and
dubious character. Indeed, the happy days
of infancy are of so gossamer a texture that
the hot sun of life's noon disperses it, as the
morning cobwebs on the grass vanish in the
heat of day. Unconscious happiness of this
kind leaves no trace, except by moulding
the mind and form, and causing the manners
to be gentle, and the vision clear, and

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

the temper calm. But the early troubles
of life are apt to leave unpleasant recollections:
floggings and fevers, accidents and
horrors, are apt to haunt the memory at intervals.
A scar lasts as long as the body
lasts; often indeed increases with age; but
youthful happiness is simply shown in afterlife
by the absence of scars from both mind
and body.</p>

<p>With me, in this my second avatar, things
are different. Rambling about under the
fine trees of our own large garden, or over
the wide expanse of the Common, I noted
down everything with an intellect as mature
as when I studied under the unseen influence
of Doctor Romayne. To my brother,
and even to Kitty, the glassy pools of Wimbledon
seemed great lakes; but I, though
my small stature magnified them physically,
was able, through an effort of comparison,

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

to make out their size pretty well. I had
experienced something like it before, when,
in the planet Mars, my vision lengthened,
and I had to learn a new scale of distances.
Besides, I had what may be called a unit of
measurement. My mind's eye carried always
the maiden, Mavis Lee: I saw that she
was unaltered, save by a pleasant plumpness,
in the matron, Mavis Marchmont. So
I used Mamma as my standard, she, dear
creature, little guessing that she was mathematically
treated by her boy.</p>

<p>Not that I always treated her mathematically.
Truth to say, the present often
passed from my eyes, and I thought of Five
Tree Hill and Saint Apollonia's Chapel by
the laughing stream, and my pretty pupil,
so loth to leave it all for the old-fashioned
comfortable home of the sober stockbroking
uncle. I marvelled what had become of

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

that uncle. He had not yet been mentioned
in my hearing.</p>

<p>However, a day arrived when I beheld
him again in the flesh. It should be premised
that my father gave great entertainments
to his city friends and clients at intervals&mdash;banquets
at which were served
wines of rare vintages, and where the cut
flowers and dessert-fruit would cost fifty
pounds at a time. I knew this, for I saw
the preparations and heard the servants'
gossip; and, as Algy and I lay in our two
white beds, we used to hear the carriages
driving to the door .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the dinner-hour
usually being nine!</p>

<p>One summer day there was to be one of
these festivities; and in the afternoon we
three children, instead of being allowed to
take our usual run upon the Common, were
dressed up rather smartly, and taken by one

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

of the maids into the garden. On the lawn
there is a great plane-tree, lovely as that
which Xerxes hung with jewels priceless&mdash;for
no tree grows more nobly in London
and its vicinage than the Asiatic plane.
Under this tree I beheld, pleasantly seated
around a table, whereon were tall bottles
of light wine, and plates of summer fruit,
my father and mother, and uncle Paul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and Mr. Arundel Lee. Older and feebler
than when I saw him last, he was yet unmistakeably
the same. The lights and shadows
dropped through the flat leaves, moved by a
soft south wind, upon his bald head and
gold-rimmed spectacles, upon my mother's
soft fair hair, and the red rose in the bosom
of her white dress, on my father's gay and
jolly face, which always gave one the impression
that stockbroking must be rather
fun than otherwise, rather like a game of

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

cricket than a dry matter of business, upon
Uncle Paul's thoughtful olive countenance,
lighted up by quick brown eyes, that seemed
to look into depths of space, yet somehow
saw everything close at hand. He may
have been thinking of stars, but he never
missed a flower.</p>

<p>"So these are the little people," said Mr.
Arundel Lee. I found afterwards that he
had been abroad for his health for some
years, travelling from spa to spa, and so
had never seen my brother and me. "The
boys are not much alike for twins. I think
this one's most like <i>you</i>, Mavis," he continued,
putting his hand on my shoulders.</p>

<p>Now this set me thinking. I had often
noticed that Algy was a deal more like Papa
than I was. It suddenly occurred to me at
this instant that, when little Mavis grew to
be my pupil at Five Tree Hill, she came to

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

have a look in her eyes, an expression in
her face, that reminded me of myself, as I
appeared in a remarkably good miniature
on ivory, taken when I was in the Guards.
I remembered speculating on the formative
power of mind over matter, and writing
down some desultory thoughts thereon.</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> a decided likeness about the
eyes and mouth," said my uncle, thoughtfully;
"but Dot's such an image of her
mother, that I did not notice it till Mr. Lee
saw it. As to Algy, he's the very picture
of <i>you</i>, Charlie."</p>

<p>"I hope he'll do as well," quoth Mr.
Lee. "It's early times to talk of such
things, but I suppose you'll put both the
youngsters on the Exchange?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing like it," said my father.
"Still there is a matter to be considered,
and that's a young fellow's natural capacity.

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

You and I, Mr. Lee, make our money easy
enough. If Paul had gone on 'Change,
though he's no end of a mathematician I'm
told, he'd have ruined himself in a month.
So I must wait till these heroes have some
character to show, before I come to any
decision."</p>

<p>I thought I could have helped papa to a
decision at once in my case.</p>

<p>"There's much in that, much in that,"
quoth Mr. Lee, oracularly. "Well, you know,
Marchmont, all I've got&mdash;and I'm sure I
don't know how much it is&mdash;belongs to
Mavis: but I don't want to tie it up, so that
you can't make use of it, for you know how
to make money: and I want to talk to you
some day quietly, about the feasibility of an
arrangement by which you shall have the
use of the principal, with some sort of clause
giving the bulk of it to either of the boys

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

that becomes a stockbroker, or dividing
between them if both do. I want to do it
soon; for I haven't made any will, and I may
go off at a moment's notice."</p>

<p>"O, Uncle Arundel," cried Mamma, springing
from her chair, "don't talk about money
and death on a sweet summer day like this.
Let me give you some more hock and a few
grapes."</p>

<p>"You're as wild as a bird," he said, "and
I believe the outlandish name poor Tom
gave you means a thrush. This hock of
yours, Marchmont, is better than any I can
buy; and hock is the only wine my doctor
will let me touch. Not a glass of port!" he
added, plaintively.</p>

<p>"I'll send you over a few dozen to-morrow,"
said my father. "I have an immense
lot, bought cheap when Riqueti the
wine-merchant failed. It is Johannisberger
of 1840."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

<p>"Thanks," said my bland great-uncle.
Then, in a whisper, "I shall see you in the
City to-morrow."</p>

<p>We children all the while were romping
on the cool grass, eating fruit, and having
plenty of fun. I quite enjoyed being a
child again, and found not the slightest difficulty
in acting, and even thinking, like a
child. Kitty loved me better than she loved
Algy; being three years older than we, she
assumed a right to tyrannize over us. I gave
an amused submission, like Lord Derby's
immortal navvie; but Algy rebelled, and
used to cry, and tell the nurse that Kitty
had been pulling his hair or pinching him.
I began to fear there was a touch of meanness
in Algernon's character.</p>

<p>Presently the conversation of our elders
took another turn. Mr. Arundel Lee, enlivened
perhaps by Johannisberger that no

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

man would shame by a supernaculum, was
again laughing at Mamma's unusual name.</p>

<p>"Christian names have something to do
with people's characters, or I should never
have found you at Five Tree Hill, taking
lessons in all sorts of absurd things from a
half-cracked old baronet, who had lived
alone with his books till he might have
been bound in calf."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Me</span>!</p>

<p>O great-uncle! How I should like to
break out and say a word or two. To
prevent accident, I filled my mouth
with the very biggest strawberry I could
find.</p>

<p>"He was the wisest man I ever knew,"
said my mother, simply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Me</span>!</p>

<p>I was glad I had half choked myself
with that huge strawberry.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

<p>"He was an uncommonly good fellow,
Mavis," said my father.

<p><span class="smcap">Me</span>!</p></p>

<p>"He must have been a very remarkable
man, from all we hear of his history," added
Uncle Paul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Me</span>!</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Arundel Lee, laughing,
"I did not mean to raise such a storm of
indignation. I found him a perfect gentleman,
certainly. But he was rather odd,
you know, Mavis, and so I don't wonder
you are rather odd sometimes."</p>

<p>Mamma laughed merrily. I thought the
old gentleman rather rude in his attempts
at humour. But wasn't I proud of Mamma's
opinion of her tutor and son? Faith, I could
hardly sleep that night!</p>

<p>Indeed, I did not sleep much, for various
causes. I lay awake listening to the carriages

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

crunching the gravel as the guests
began to arrive. Then I speculated as to
who were there, and what Mr. Arundel Lee
would say, and how Mamma was dressed.
Then I wondered what would happen if I
walked downstairs in my night-shirt, and
gave the assembled party a condensed narrative
of my former existence.</p>

<p>After this I fell into a doze, and dreamt
of Five Tree Hill, and was abruptly wakened
by the noise of departing carriages. One
or two o'clock, I conjectured. Very often,
on sleepless nights, I would creep out of
bed, and open my door quietly, and look at
the clock in the hall below, which was
always lighted. I did so now. It was just
two.</p>

<p>I stood by the balustrade and looked
down on the gay folk departing. As I
stood I heard Uncle Paul's musical voice.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

<p>"You don't seem very well, Mr. Lee, so
you must let me go home with you. I am a
young man, you know; what time I go to
bed is no consequence."</p>

<p>"You'll find it out when you're older,"
growled Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd sleep here, uncle," said
Mamma.</p>

<p>"No; I'm well enough. But this mad-cap
may come if he likes, and I'll give him
some refreshment at the end of the journey.
Come along, sir! Good night, Mavis."</p>

<p>I crept back to bed, and this time slept
soundly and dreamlessly.</p>

<p>When morning came, and a couple of
maids entered the room to look after our
baths and dressing, I noticed a scared expression
on their faces, especially on that of
Irish Nora, who had stuck faithfully to the
family. As they manipulated us they talked

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

in whispers, and positively forgot to put
soap into our eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, poor old gentleman!" Nora said.
"Wasn't it sudden? And Mr. Paul back
here only an hour ago, dead tired with
getting doctors and all. Well, he was a
good old gentleman, and I wish he had
been of the true Church, for he gave me a
sovereign after I brought him the children
to see, and I'd have spent it in masses
for his soul: but it would be no use to
waste it on a Protestant."</p>

<p>Something evidently had happened to
Mr. Arundel Lee. The household was so
upset that I did not see Mamma till the
afternoon. Then she was crying too much
than to tell us more than that her poor
dear uncle was dead. When I made out
the story it came to this: Uncle Paul had
gone home with him because he looked a

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

little fagged. He slept all the way to Clapham.
My uncle and the footman helped
him into the hall; there he was obliged to
sit down; in a few moments he became
apoplectic, and was quite gone by the time
a doctor could be brought to him.</p>

<p>So Mr. Arundel Lee died intestate after
all; and, as my mother was his only direct
relation, the immense property became my
father's.</p>

<p>Algy and I had to sit in a funeral coach
when Mr. Lee was buried; and Algy cried
with fright all the way. I did my best to
console him, reflecting on the folly of sending
young children to funerals.</p>

<p>Being a bad hand at dates, I cannot say
how old we were at that time. An approximation
may be obtained from the fact that
till we were put into mourning we had
never worn trousers. Algy's fright at the

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

funeral did not prevent his being very vain
of his new habiliments&mdash;so vain that he
made Dot laugh, though she grew solemn
and sorrowful again on the instant, and rebuked
him for his levity. As for me, I had
too much enjoyed the airy linen of childhood
to rejoice in black broadcloth.</p>

</div>

<p>ONE day my father took holiday. It
was after one of his great dinners, and
he had been rather tired. He could well
afford to take holiday now, for Mr. Arundel
Lee's large property had enabled him greatly
to extend a business already enormous;
so he was far less regular in the city than
heretofore, leaving very much to his partners;
and he talked of buying or building a

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

country house, and becoming a country
gentleman. He had the look of one, in
those pleasant eyes and with that stalwart
form, far more than of a City man. My mother
was eager that he should carry out this idea,
for she tired of the heavy ceremonious dinners
and the eternal interchange of visits.
Mavis Lee, whose soul had been coloured
by the pure atmosphere of Five Tree Hill,
was not likely to enjoy life in a London
suburb, all hurry and ostentation.</p>

<p>On this particular holiday, my father lay
long in bed. He is by nature luxurious, as
are many men whose energy when aroused
is indefatigable. I remember we children
were summoned to his room as he lay in
royal indolence, forgetful of stocks and
shares&mdash;a spacious lofty many-windowed
room, with appliances fit for a prince. He
had on a table by his bedside a cup of fragrant

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

chocolate; the smell of that liquid
(which I myself have never been able to
drink) always recalls that morning. Scents
act strongly on the memory. He talked
much nonsense to us, as was his wont&mdash;and
no man talked nonsense better in those pleasant
days. Then he said to Mamma, who
was sitting by a window in matutine dishabille,
with a book in her hand (it was Bacon's
Essays),</p>

<p>"Mavis, I'll breakfast under the plane
tree to-day; the young uns can make it their
dinner. Is Paul here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said. "I wouldn't let him
go to the Temple last night, though he pretended
he had a lot of business to do."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. By Jove, it's twelve
o'clock! Run away, you kids, and I'll have
my bath."</p>

<p>We ran away, and were soon in the

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

wildest part of the grounds. Kitty and
Algy insisted on my telling them a story&mdash;they
had found out that I either knew or
could invent all manner of narrative absurdities,
and they worried me perpetually into
telling them tales. I found it an infinite
bore. Luckily on this occasion the servants
were in search of us before I could get beyond
"<i>Once upon a time</i>."</p>

<p>It was a jolly day this. My father, who,
like most men of sanguine temperament, had
a great gift of sleep, had washed away his
fatigue in the hypnotic ocean. He was like
a giant refreshed, and sat down to his
breakfast with that giant appetite which is
somehow infectious, and makes other people
eat more than they intended. We youngsters
had quite an unusual, and doubtless
unhealthy, dinner; we had kidneys in champagne,
and lobster mayonnaise, and dishes

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

hot with pepper, and dishes chilled with
ice. I found that my palate took these
things readily, whence I judged that the soul
rather than the body must be the seat of
taste. Observing Dot and Algy scientifically,
it appeared to me that they ate
greedily enough, but did not quite like it.</p>

<p>Pondering on this, I came to a second
query: If the soul is the seat of taste, does
it also control digestion? I felt sure that
Dot and Algy would very soon have&mdash;well&mdash;stomach-aches;
should I? I ate as much
as I possibly could, to test this question fairly.</p>

<p>I also drank as much as I could, to test a
third problem. My father, who was in his
gayest humour, insisted (though Mamma
protested) on giving us small glasses of
champagne; and I think that, by adroit
contrivance, I got twice as much as my
brother and sister together.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

<p>The result of these experiments gave me
great satisfaction, proving my theory to be
right as to the power of the soul over the
body. Dot and Algy both grew flushed
and noisy and pert; they said saucy things
to Mamma; they were childishly ebrious.
Suddenly they subsided into feeling very
poorly, and crying, and wanting to go to
bed. They went, ignominiously. I remained,
being in my usual state, and feeling
that I could wind up with something devilled
and a bottle of good claret.</p>

<p>"Ah!" methought, "when I grow up to
the publishing age, and irrefragably prove
to the world by this experiment that the
soul is master of the body, what a stride
metaphysics will make!"</p>

<p>It did not strike me, in my wisdom of
childhood, that probably the world would
altogether disbelieve my story.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

<p>"I told you not to be so foolish, Charlie,"
said Mamma, looking ready to cry. "Those
children will be quite ill, poor dear little
things!"</p>

<p>"Why, look at Rex!" said Papa, with a
laugh. "I've been watching the grave little
rogue. He's eaten more than Dot and
Whiskers together, and there's nothing in
the world the matter with him. Is there,
Paul?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said my uncle. "I suppose
he has a strong constitution, for the
quantity he has eaten and drunk would
have been quite enough to make me feel
uncomfortable."</p>

<p>How I rejoiced in this spontaneous testimony
to the truth of my theory! I don't
think anybody of my age ever devoted himself
so heartily to science!</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Mavis!" said Papa; "the

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

young monkeys will be right enough with a
little saline medicine. But now, about what
we were saying. It is time they were out
of the hands of nursemaids. I don't believe
even Kitty knows her alphabet&mdash;to say nothing
of the catechism and the multiplication
table. They ought to have a governess till
we pack them off to school. What do you
think, Mavis?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, but I don't
want a governess in the house; she would
be so much in the way. Why, my dear
Charlie, one of the chief subjects of conversation
with the ladies who call here is their
troubles with governesses. It seems to me
that they are either very clever, and know
too much by half, and expect to be equal
and familiar with the mistress of the house&mdash;or
otherwise they are desperately ignorant,
and the very servants laugh at them. O, I
dread a governess!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

<p>"An intelligent nursery governess would
do, I should think, to begin with. She
would be quite free from those objections.
What do you think, Paul?" said my father.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with either of you," Uncle
Paul replied. "Observe what you want for
these children. They require sound elementary
training&mdash;not much instruction just now,
but right instruction. Fancy a nursery
governess having the remotest idea of how
to teach arithmetic or geography or history!
She would make the children learn tables
and all the capes of Europe and all the
kings of England&mdash;and they would get a
vague notion that sixteen ounces multiplied
by Cape Finisterre produced Henry VIII."</p>

<p>My father and mother laughed heartily.
Uncle Paul went on:</p>

<p>"There is no reason, sister Mavis, why
a governess should be at either one or the
other extreme your lady visitors describe so

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

vividly. A lady, as governess, would be only
too anxious not to intrude on your privacy,
while she might be trusted to enforce respect
from servants. These boys, you know,
ought to get through the Latin accidence
before they are sent to school, and the first
book of Euclid would not hurt them, and
they ought to get an accurate outline notion
of the geography and history of England.
That's enough to start them with; an intelligent
gentlewoman would teach them that
in a year, while Dot would be learning
everything a young lady ought to know."</p>

<p>"Where shall we find your intelligent
gentlewoman?" asked my father. "Though
I fear, if you found her, Mavis would spoil
her; she'd make too great a pet of such a
paragon."</p>

<p>Uncle Paul paused, as if doubtful whether
to proceed.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

<p>"I think I know the very person, if she
would consent to come."</p>

<p>"Consent!" said my father.</p>

<p>"Yes; she is not looking for a situation,
but I have told her she would be wise to take
one. She is strangely placed. Her father,
whom I first knew through a college friend, is
Rector of Lytheby in Norfolk: he is, I think,
the cleverest man I ever knew; he is, I am
certain, the weakest. He was married in his
youth to a superior woman, who took charge
of him, kept him straight, suggested texts
for his sermons and themes for his books, and
made him a good reputation. He had a
fair amount of private property; indeed the
advowson of Lytheby is his own by inheritance.
His only child by his first wife was
a daughter, Annie&mdash;the girl I think may
suit you. She learnt almost everything
from her father and mother; I tell her she

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

is a regular Universal Dictionary; but she is
not a bit spoilt or pedantic."</p>

<p>"How old is she?" asked mamma.</p>

<p>"Somewhere about five-and-twenty," replied
Uncle Paul, "so far as I can judge.
She isn't pretty, but she is very gentle and
quiet. She reminds me of Shakespeare's
Cordelia."</p>

<p>"One would think you were in love with
her, Paul," said my father, who listened
lazily while he smoked a cigar.</p>

<p>I was watching my uncle all the time he
spoke, eating peaches the while. I never
at any age disliked peaches. When mine
uncle was talking, those dreamy eyes so
brightened into stars, those mobile lips so
changed with every word, that to watch him
was for me an excitement. I could see an
expression of intense pain cross his sensitive
face as he heard Papa speak those words.
But he went on, quietly:</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

<p>"Not at all. I pity her heartily. Her
father, tired possibly of being kept straight
by a superior woman, in less than a year
went crooked, and married a very inferior
one. She was the daughter of his housekeeper,
an impudent red-faced ignorant
baggage of sixteen. She leads the poor
weak Rector a dreadful life; he is infatuated
with the hussy, and obeys her like a slave.
She tried to treat Annie as if she were a
servant. Annie, loth to leave her father,
though she has enough from her mother to
live very quietly, did all she could by way
of keeping peace. But it was useless. One
day this insolent wench, who is as strong as
a horse, positively boxed poor gentle Annie's
ears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The wretch!" said my mother.</p>

<p>"Thereupon Annie came quietly away,
being prevented from seeing her father, and

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

is now staying with a friend in London. I
advise her, though she has about a hundred
and fifty a year of her own, to find some occupation
that will cause her to forget her
feeling of loneliness."</p>

<p>"That parson must be an awful fool,
Paul," said my father. "You have not told
us his name."</p>

<p>"He is not a fool. He has one of the
strongest clearest intellects I know. But he
is devoid of will. Tell him a thing to be
done, and he will do it better than anyone
of whom I have experience."</p>

<p>"He is simply an intellectual machine,"
said Mamma. "He cannot have more soul
than one of those calculating machines."</p>

<p>"I think you are right," laughed my
uncle. "The Reverend Roger Keith&mdash;that's
his name&mdash;is a machine. But Annie isn't;
she's a true girl, with a fine intellect unusually

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

well cultivated; and I should like
to have that wretched wench put in the
pillory that dared to assault her."</p>

<p>"Let her come here if she likes," said
Manama. "Charlie will settle about
salary."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed my father at this
point, "that boy has eaten all the peaches.
He'll be ill."</p>

<p>"No, I shan't, Papa," I said. "It's a waste
of time."</p>

<p>"That young imp wants a governess," was
the parental rejoinder.</p>

<p>The governess came in a few days, by
which time my brother and sister had recovered
from the effects of their gluttony.
She was a quiet young lady, dressed in grey,
with very thoughtful eyes, and hair of a
soft light brown. When I saw her meek
and gentle expression, I longed to go into

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

Norfolk and inflict physical violence on the
gross animal that had assaulted her. But,
reflecting that I should suffer ignominious
defeat at the hands of such a virago, I decided
to leave it till I should grow bigger.</p>

<p>We were introduced to Miss Annie Keith
in my mother's private room&mdash;not a boudoir
at all, but a room of books, paintings,
sketches with pen and pencil, ferns and
fancies, follies and flowers. There they
were drinking tea from dainty china, with
accessory shreds of bread and butter.
Such a contrast! Annie the essence of
loving gentleness; Mamma the essence of
loving power. I marvelled what would
have happened to that audacious hoyden if
she had attempted to assault my mother.
There was a strong high spirit in Mavis
Marchmont's bright eye and curved resolute
mouth.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

<p>Kitty and Algy did not fancy Miss Keith
for a governess as I did. Of course they
had not heard her sad story; and could
not have understood it if they had.</p>

<p>As to my mother, she fell in love with
her at once.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">FROM HOME TO SCHOOL.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Maxima debetur reverentia pueris."</p>

</div>

<p>MISS ANNIE KEITH very soon became
a favourite member of our
household, combining gentleness with firmness
and simplicity with knowledge in a
manner most unusual. My complete allegiance
she had from the first. She soon
obtained the confidence of Dot and Algy,
and managed their different tempers capitally.
Dot was quick and bright, and sometimes saucy;
Algy was slow and lazy, and

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

apt to be sulky. Miss Keith seemed to
know some magic method of dealing with
each temperament successfully.</p>

<p>Then she was of infinite service to my
mother, saving her half the trouble of
household management. She was one of
those women who organize by instinct, and
never fail to find a resource in any difficulty.
The lonely and thoughtful maidenhood of
Mavis Lee had not been at all a fit preparation
for domestic economy on a large scale;
everything of the kind bored her; and it
was a wonderful relief to her mind, this
having a lady on whom she could depend to
direct the machinery of the establishment.
Papa and Uncle Paul often laughed at her
about it&mdash;reminding her of her dread of a
governess, who must either be a fine lady,
or sink to the servile level.</p>

<p>The relation between my father and uncle

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

was curious. My father, possessing to perfection
the business intellect, would have
made money in anything he attempted; at
this moment he was looking forward with
enthusiasm to the time when he should
purchase an estate, and farm the land
himself, and elevate the condition of the
labourers, and prove to country gentlemen
that a man may make his own land pay.
As I have said, he took business as a boy
takes cricket; he knew the game "all
round;" he was the W. E. Grace of the
Stock Exchange. My uncle, on the other
hand, was student and thinker, pure and
simple; he looked on business as a dreary
toil for sordid ends. He studied the world
around him, human and sub-human; studied
character in society and the streets; knew
the habits of all wild flowers and birds; yet
had a higher vision&mdash;a dream of subtle

<!-- vol 3 page 51 -->

science, which was to solve the most difficult
problem of life.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this contrast of character,
the brothers were the fastest of
friends. My uncle was at the bar without
practice, and had chambers in the Temple,
and wrote in many ways with many signatures,
pouring out the strong superfluity of
an ever-active mind. His mind was no pool,
but a fresh well-spring, always in overflow.
But his London literature and his abstract
studies did not prevent him from passing
many hours daily at Marchmont Lodge, and
it really seemed as if neither my father nor
my mother could do without him. His
chivalrous devotion to my mother was very
pretty to see.</p>

<p>Years later I learnt that he had loved my
mother. When my father became intimate
with old Mr. Lee, he made up his mind pretty

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

quickly as to that gentleman's niece; and
there is reason to believe that her mind also
moved rapidly on that occasion. At any
rate an engagement was soon made, to Mr.
Arundel Lee's great delight; he had been in
terror lest his niece should marry out of the
Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Soon after the engagement was actually
made, Paul Marchmont came from Cambridge
crowned with the highest scholastic
honours. My father took him to Mr. Lee's,
and he used to dine there pretty regularly in
the days that preceded the marriage. But
at last he struck.</p>

<p>"I'm not going over to Clapham to-morrow,"
he said to his brother.</p>

<p>"Why the devil not?" said Charlie
Marchmont. "If you are not there to talk
to prosy old Lee, I shall have to do it, and
what will Mavis say?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 53 -->

<p>"I am not going," he repeated, doggedly.
"I'll never go there again until you're
married."</p>

<p>My father opened his eyes in amazement.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Charlie, I'll tell you.
Your Mavis is too beautiful, too charming in
every way, for any man to see her and not
love her. I am not the man, at any rate. If
she were not yours, I should try to win her;
but she is yours, so I shall run away from
her too perilous beauty. Help me: say I
am gone on a secret mission to San Francisco,
or any other remote place. I will come
back when you are married. When she is
my sister, I shall take her hand with no
tremulous feeling, and shall try to serve her
in knightly fashion."</p>

<p>My father could hardly understand this
feeling. He was a little puzzled.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

<p>"Do you really mean, Paul, that you are
in love with Miss Lee?"</p>

<p>"No: emphatically no. I merely feel that
I should be compelled to love her if I saw
her very often. I merely feel that if she
were engaged to any man but you, Charlie,
I'd take her away from him, even if I had
to kill him in doing it. I merely feel that I
must go away somewhere and try to forget
that perilous face, though it will haunt me
all the time."</p>

<p>"You are an odd fellow, Paul," said my
father. "Have your own way. But will
you not have the same feeling when we are
married?"</p>

<p>"O dear no," he answered quickly. "All
will be changed! Mavis will be my sister.
The mad fancy I have now will be extinguished,
annihilated. You may trust me,
Charlie."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

<p>"I trust you, Paul. Let it be as you say.
I will invent some fiction that will satisfy
Mavis; but, O dear me, what <i>shall</i> I do
with old Lee after dinner?"</p>

<p>I heard most of this from my uncle, in
after-years, when he and I had become very
fast friends. He placed the narrow sea between
himself and his fair tormentor, and
took refuge in the little island of Sark.
Amid its wild scenery her unique face haunted
him; he came suddenly back to Southampton,
and buried himself in the ferny depths
of the New Forest. Wandering one day near
the Twelve Apostles, he met a gipsy&mdash;a man
nearer seventy than sixty, though his hair
was dark and his form erect and his limbs
lisson. They got into talk&mdash;the gipsy asked
to look at his palm.</p>

<p>"You have loved and lost," he said;
"you will love and win."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

<p>My uncle could never quite understand
the force of that prediction, though it was
clear enough to me. He, lover of truth,
of wisdom, of beauty by means of that love
won happiness.</p>

<p>Mamma was always thinking he ought to
fall in love with Annie Keith. All women
worth anything are match-makers; and
Mamma was so delighted with Annie that
she thought her fit bride for even a senior
wrangler, though probably she did not quite
know the meaning of that dignity. But neither
my uncle nor Miss Keith was marriageably
inclined; so Mamma's scheme
failed.</p>

<p>I was very much amused with Miss Annie
Keith as a governess. It was clear that I
puzzled her. She had never seen such a
boy. She taught capitally; and as she
was teaching things which I knew a great

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

deal better than she did, I was a pretty
fair judge. Kitty, being three years our
senior, and just at the age when girls like
learning and boys hate it, was quite proud
of her superiority to us. We were to learn
Latin&mdash;of course she decided to learn Latin
too. It was pretty to see how she cantered
through declensions and conjugations&mdash;it
was painful to see Algy shirking his fences,
and finding it impossible to believe that the
Romans could have been such fools as to
conjugate their verbs in four ways, when
one would amply have sufficed. As for me,
I tried to look as if I had never seen a Latin
verb before, and made the most ludicrous
mistakes, and did my best to maintain a
character for that hatred of learning which
is the healthy privilege of boyhood. Girls
and men never have it, being inferior
animals. I resisted more temptation in

<!-- vol 3 page 58 -->

this second childhood of mine than ever in
my first avatar. I longed often to tell Dot
and Whiskers, and even Miss Keith, what
dreadful blunders they were making with
their Latin and arithmetic. But I resisted,
and blundered as much myself as possibly I
could, and wondered how it was my blunders
were not discovered.</p>

<p>I fear I astonished gentle Annie Keith.
Having to suppress my actual self, I was
often in extremes. Sometimes I was very
clever&mdash;sometimes terribly stupid. She
most certainly regarded me as a regular
problem.</p>

<p>However, the months moved on, and we
lived and laughed and learnt lessons together,
and I managed to conceal my secret.
But I began to think a man ought to be a
most accomplished actor in order to play
the child with anything like success.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

<p>My father, having made up his mind to
turn country gentleman as soon as possible,
was wont to look through the advertisements
of the <i>Times</i> every morning in search
of places to be sold. Well I remember a
pleasant spring morning, when we were all
at breakfast together&mdash;Miss Keith presiding
over tea and coffee, as was the regular custom,
Papa petting Kitty as he read his
paper, Mamma lazily lounging in an easy-chair
by the fire, and expecting Algy and
me to bring to her little table what she
wanted&mdash;when my father suddenly crumpled
up his <i>Times</i>, and said,</p>

<p>"The very place! I shall go and see it
to-day."</p>

<p>"A place in the country that you like,
Charlie?" said Mamma. "How delicious!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, standing up by the fireplace, 
"you want to go, I know. Well,

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

this seems the very place. It is Romayne
Court, near Redborough, where old General
Romayne used to live, who died a few
months ago, nearly ninety. It seems, from
what I hear, that he had only one son, who
died before him: and the property is to be
sold under some decree of the Court of
Chancery. I know the place."</p>

<p>"So do I, by the Eternal!" was my instant
thought; and I was carried back in
memory to the choleric old gentleman who
quarrelled with his artist-son! I hoped my
father would buy the place. How close I
should be to Five Tree Hill! My mother
did not connect one place with the other,
but she showed real delight at the idea of
going into the country.</p>

<p>My Uncle Paul came in just then, with a
gay smile on his somewhat sad face, and
brought my mother a few rare flowers from

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

Covent Garden. He delighted in these
little offerings, and my father had no touch
of jealousy about them. He and Paul
understood each other.</p>

<p>"Paul," he said, "come down to Redborough
with me. I think Romayne Court
is the very place to suit us. I want to
look at it directly. Have you breakfasted?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Uncle Paul, "on seltzer and
brandy. Order your carriage while I eat
two or three kidneys. Annie will give me
a cup of tea."</p>

<p>One reason perchance of my father's
wonderful success was, that he never let the
grass grow under his feet. He drove
straight to the agent to secure the refusal of
Romayne Court, took train to Redborough
and looked at the place, came back and
signed an agreement to purchase, subject to

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

a conveyancer's approval of the title. The
whole thing was a matter of hours. The
result, which delighted us all, but delighted
my mother and me above anything, was that
in a few months we migrated from Wimbledon
to Romayne Court. My mother was
pleased with the thought of a quiet country
life: I felt special satisfaction in being so
near scenes which had been familiar for
years. How had they changed? I longed
to know. I felt sure there would be a
chance of knowing soon.</p>

<p>We settled down. One morning said my
sire, who was wont to propound his schemes
at breakfast,</p>

<p>"These boys must go to school soon,
Mavis. Miss Keith can manage Dot, but
they ought to learn something. They are
twelve."</p>

<p>Uncle Paul was staying with us.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

<p>"Send them to Grindley's," he said, turning
from his omelet to look at his impetuous
brother.</p>

<p>"Grindley's?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Best school in the county. Best
private school in the world. Old Cato
Grindley's dead; but his nephew, Cicero
Grindley, who was with me at Cambridge,
keeps the school up well. Just the place for
these youngsters&mdash;three miles off, you can
see it from the window&mdash;so they could come
home for any Sunday or holiday."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Mavis?" asked my
father.</p>

<p>"If they must go," said Mamma, "and I
suppose they must, I should certainly prefer
their going to a school Paul knows all about,
and that I can see from my windows. I can
drive the ponies over whenever I like. But
you know," she continued, shaking her rosy

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

forefinger at Papa, "I shall not decide until
I have seen Mrs. Grindley."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said my father. "The
mistress of a household is its soul."</p>

</div>

<p>THE year before we left London had
been a time of unusual bustle and excitement,
for the Hyde Park Exhibition&mdash;first
in a series of immense imbecilities&mdash;was
plaguing the world of London, and my
father's set were, of course, just the people

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

to make much of an event like this.
There was a perpetual whirl. One glance
at the big glass house was enough for me;
I thought it as much like architecture as Mr.
Thackeray's ode in the <i>Times</i>, which he had
forgiven for its "thunder and small beer,"
was like poetry. Mamma was of like
opinion, and positively declined to pay
perpetual visits to the place; so, as
Kitty and Algy liked it excessively,
and screamed with delight whenever they
were allowed to go there, it came to their
going very often with Miss Keith, while I
stayed quietly at home with my mother.
Then she would tell me the story of her
youth, little knowing to whom she was telling
it. Then she would describe Ford Cottage
and Beau Sejour and St. Apollonia's
Chapel, and Sir Edward Ellesmere. Then
she would teach me what years ago I had

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

taught her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pure poetry, and old romance,
and subtle whims of the intellect. It
was delightful to receive, filtered through
Mavis's mind, the ideas which she had first
learnt from me. How delighted she was
with my swift apprehension! Verily it was
extremely pleasant for both mother and son;
since there was, for manifest reasons, perfect
accord between the two minds. She taught
me what I knew full well before; but it
assumed a deeper meaning after it had been
crystallized in her intellectual atmosphere.</p>

<p>My mother and I had become such very
great friends during the Exhibition year,
that she was quite loth to part with me when
the time came for our going to school. I
looked forward to it. I wanted to be a
schoolboy again. Algy, I remember, cried;
Kitty laughed at him for crying; Mamma
scolded her, and said she should be whipped

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

if she was so hard-hearted. As for me, I
quite enjoyed the idea, and looked forward
with delight to a renewal of my acquaintance
with <i>Pons asinorum</i> and <i>Propria quae maribus</i>,
and had delicious visions of cricket and
football, rowing and swimming.</p>

<p>The waggonette was at the door. My
father had taken to driving four in hand.
Algy and I were inside with our trunks:
Uncle Paul sat on the box: off we started
gaily towards Birchanger Park. It was a
pleasant drive, and a pleasant scene when
we got there. The old-fashioned red brick
house stands in a southern hollow of the
hills, and above it the hanger (or hanging
wood), chiefly of birch-trees, which gives it
its name. As I beheld the great mass of
silver-rinded thin-sprayed trees, I thought of
Coleridge's lines:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Beneath a weeping birch, most beautiful
Of forest trees, the lady of the woods."</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 3 page 69 -->

<p>My father drove up to the front in grand
style, a groom blowing a horn to notify our
approach. I suppose few people made so
magnificent a first appearance.</p>

<p>Dr. Cicero Grindley was a very different
man from my old acquaintance, Dr. Cato
Grindley, his uncle. He was a man of
about thirty, six feet two or three in height,
light-haired, keen-eyed, with a clear-cut
Greek face, and with the most marvellous
flow of language most musically uttered.
His Ciceronian baptism was prophetic. When
I had been his pupil a very short time, I
discovered that although he was a sufficiently
stern disciplinarian after the antique fashion,
yet far more than the flogging-block did
everybody dread the sharp sarcasms with
which he punished dunces and mutineers.
His courtesy to my father and uncle was
more like that of a prince receiving illustrious

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

visitors, than of a schoolmaster taking
two small boys as pupils. It was superb
without being absurd. I thought I perceived
an amused expression in Uncle Paul's countenance.
However, the reception was a
pleasant one, and my father went away quite
satisfied with the establishment. I need not
say that my mother had previously made
Mrs. Grindley's acquaintance, and been quite
taken by her. This indeed nobody could
help. She was simply the most fascinating
woman I ever saw.</p>

<p>Algy and I had two introductions to
pass&mdash;one to the school indoors, the other
to the school out of doors. I looked forward
to both with much amusement. Poor
Algy was in an awful funk, of course; but I,
who had known Eton in my earlier youth,
did not much fear the smaller world on
which I was about to enter.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

<p>Dr. Cicero Grindley handed us over to
an examiner&mdash;a seedy man named Glanville,
whose duty it was to find out what we
knew, and place us accordingly. Poor Algernon
could not remember anything Miss
Keith had taught him. This seedy Glanville,
taking snuff all the time, tried us in
Euclid, arithmetic, and the Eton Latin
Grammar. There was a black board in the
room, and lots of lumps of chalk lay round
it, as if it were the habit of black boards to
lay misshapen white eggs.</p>

<p>"Now, young gentlemen," says Glanville,
taking snuff, "prove that the angles at
the base of an isosceles triangle are equal."</p>

<p>He motioned Algy to try first. The unfortunate
youngster tried, and produced a
network of nonsense that was almost laughable.</p>

<p>"Rub that out," says Glanville, in a

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

voice of thunder. "Now, sir," to me,
"you try&mdash;but I suppose one is as great
a fool as the other."</p>

<p>Now I had intended to appear quite as
great a fool as Algy, that we might remain
in the same form; but this snuffy man's insolence
annoyed me. So I worked the immortal
<i>pons asinorum</i> out in the very words
of Euclid, evidently to Glanville's amazement;
and then I said:</p>

<p>"Euclid's demonstration is unnecessarily
complex. Allow me to try another.</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="fig04.png" />
</p>

<p>Let the isosceles triangle A B C be laid on
its opposite side, as in A' C' B'. Then
there are two triangles having their sides
A B, A C, equal to A' C', A' B', and the
angle B A C equal to C' A' B'. Therefore

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

the remaining angles are equal, each to
each; therefore A B C is equal to A' C' B',
which is the same as A C B."</p>

<p>I thought that snuffy tutor's hair would
stand on end with astonishment as I thus
demonstrated. He paused awhile, and then
passed on to arithmetic, requesting Algy,
who was supposed to understand fractions,
to do an addition sum therein:</p>

<p class="center">

</p>

</p>

</div> -->

<p>Algy, poor dear boy, made his L.C.M. 120,
and then blundered away till he got as a
result

5 <span class="sup">2</span>/<span class="sub">17</span>.</p>

<!-- 5<math><mfrac><mtext>2</mtext><mtext>17</mtext></mfrac></math> -->

<p>"That boy's an idiot!" growled Glanville,
and took snuff. "You try it, sir."</p>

<p>I took a bit of chalk and wrote on the
board:</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="fig07.png" />
</p>

<!-- <div class="math">

</div> -->

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

<p>I don't think I ever saw a man quite so
astonished as Glanville, though I have had
unusual opportunities of astonishing people.
It took him some time to attack us again.</p>

<p>"Young gentleman," to Algernon, "conjugate
<i>malo</i>."</p>

<p>This Algy did, with slight misadventure.</p>

<p>"As to you, sir," he said, "I suppose you
can write elegiacs?"</p>

<p>"Modern writers of the Latin elegiac," I
said&mdash;"Lord Wellesley not excepted&mdash;do
not attain perfection because they have not
the true theory of scansion. The pentameter
consists of two dactyls, one spondee, and
two anapaests."</p>

<p>"The devil!" said Glanville, and took
snuff furiously.</p>

<p>At this moment entered Dr. Cicero
Grindley, and inquired if the examination
was over. We were dismissed. What

<!-- vol 3 page 75 -->

occurred between him and the snuff-taker I
cannot say; but I found myself placed in
the fourth form, while Algy was in the first.</p>

<p>My brother and I, being dismissed,
strolled into the playing fields; cricket was
on in half-a-dozen places, and I determined
to be soon among the players. Both of us
had a complete cricketing outfit, and we
had pocket money enough to subscribe to
the innumerable small extravagances of an
aristocratic school. However, we must fall
into our places first. We walked down
under splendid elms, and I heartily enjoyed
the scene, and the thought of being a boy
again; but Algy dismally exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I shall never be happy here, Rex&mdash;never.
I must go home."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I answered. "We shall be
jolly enough."</p>

<p>"O you're such a fellow!" he said.

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

"You don't seem to care about anything."</p>

<p>We came suddenly round an angle of the
hedge, where about half-a-dozen boys had
made a fire, and were doing some rough
cookery&mdash;against rules of course. Schoolboys
who do this sort of thing in a corner,
instead of coming to the front in some good
game, are usually dolts or cads or louts.
These seemed no exception. The biggest
among them&mdash;big he seemed to me, being
probably three years my senior&mdash;cried out,</p>

<p>"Hullo, new fellows! What the devil
do you mean by coming here? This is
private."</p>

<p>He had sprung to his feet, and, as Algy
was running away, he gave him a blow in
the back, which knocked him over. Then
he rushed at me.</p>

<p>I had long since discovered that I could
manage my new body quite as well as my

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

old one. I had forgotten none of the
athletic science which schoolboys and soldiers
necessarily learn. As this fellow
came at me like a cow, I gave him one
under the chin with my right that dislocated
every bone in his brainless skull. He
fell flat on the grass. I picked up Algy,
who was more frightened than hurt, and we
wandered farther afield.</p>

<p>Our next meeting was more pleasant. It
was well on in the afternoon, and the Sixth
Eleven had drawn their stumps. As we
passed their tent we met two young fellows
of seventeen or eighteen&mdash;one in ordinary
dress, the other in flannels. They might
have been Apollo and Hercules in their
boyhood. One was tall, slight, agile; the
other of middle height and noble breadth
for a boy. One was Captain of the School;
the other Captain of the Eleven. Their

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

names were Giffard and Wintle. They
came along, arm in arm, talking over the
day's practice. Giffard noticed us at once.</p>

<p>"New fellows, eh? When did you turn
up?"</p>

<p>"A couple of hours ago," I said.</p>

<p>"Seen Glanville?" asked Giffard.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "and thought him a
fool."</p>

<p>"That young cock crows early," said the
weighty Wintle.</p>

<p>"He's right about Glanville though," says
the Captain of the school. "You two
fellows look like twins."</p>

<p>"We are," said Algy, whom I had been
trying to make talk by all conceivable
methods.</p>

<p>"So I thought. Come along with us. I
didn't know you were coming, or I'd have
found you out before. It's hard lines for

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

youngsters like you coming to a big school."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I've had to thrash one
fellow already."</p>

<p>"By Jove," said Wintle, standing still and
putting his strong hands on my shoulders,
"you're a precocious youngster! Now,
whom did you thrash?"</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "I didn't ask his name
before knocking him down, and if I had
asked afterwards he could not have told me.
I only know he was a cowardly blackguard.
He struck my brother Algernon without the
slightest provocation, so I hit him pretty
hard in return. He was doing some cookery
over a fire by the hedge yonder."</p>

<p>"That cad Price," said Giffard. "He's always
playing the bully. We'll have him up
for this, Wintle."</p>

<p>Dr. Grindley, as I came in time to learn,
gave a certain power of punishment to his

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

sixth form. He made them responsible for
general order in the school. On the present
occasion "bully Price," as he was commonly
called, was summoned before the
sixth; and, his conduct to Algy having been
proved, he received a dozen strokes with an
ash sapling. During the whole time I was
at Birchanger Park that fellow never exchanged
another word with me.</p>

<p>Placed in the fourth form, I tried to be as
slow as possible.</p>

<p>It was hard work. I could not always
help giving replies that were too clever;
and in fact I found myself in the fifth form
before I had been a month at the school.
The master of that form, Charles Marshall,
a wonderful Greek scholar, had got his boys
into the <i>Birds</i> of Aristophanes. Verily (unless
some one had burnt or otherwise misused
it) there was a verse translation of the

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

<i>Birds</i>, my latest amusement, mouldering in
the Bookroom at Beau Sejour. I really
could not resist the temptation. I drew on
my memory, and sent up occasional passages
in verse. Marshall was astonished.</p>

<p>"Marchmont major," he said, "you have
an instinctive apprehension of the Greek
comedy, and a remarkable mastery of
English verse for one so young."</p>

<p>So I was the hero of the hour in the fifth
form .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and found myself before the end of
the term promoted to the sixth. It was a
wonder. No boy in his thirteenth year had
ever before reached that Olympian level.
Of course I knew it was quite unfair; but
what was I to do? And after all, I did no
particular harm to anybody.</p>

<p>News came of Wellington's death. The
boys all felt it; the great pure stainless name of
England's steadfast chieftain was known to

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

even the youngest. For me, I went away
into a lonely corner of the playing fields,
and wept. I had known him. I had met
that bright commanding penetrative eye
which had power to search into the character
of an officer, into the contrivances of an
enemy. He was, I think, the greatest
captain the world has seen. Tennyson's
Ode was intensely inferior to its theme; but
I wholly agree with the saying,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">    " .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for one so true
There must be other nobler work to do
Than when he fought at Waterloo."</p>

</div>

<p>A month more&mdash;Christmas at Romayne
Court. Giffard and Wintle both lived
within a dozen miles of us, and both engaged
to come on Christmas Eve to spend a
week at my father's house. This arrangement
was made when the final examination
took place, and everybody's parents put in

<!-- vol 3 page 83 -->

an appearance. Dr. Cicero was quite proud
of me, and would have flattered me into
life-long vanity and conceit, had I been
honestly the <i>niger cygnus</i> that he imagined:
but knowing myself a mere imposter, I took
the thing easily. What annoyed me most
was poor dear Algy's chagrin. I had coached
him a good deal, and managed to get
him into the second form; but there he obstinately
stuck.</p>

<p>There was deep snow on the ground as
we started from Birchanger Park in the
waggonette. As a reward for my brilliant
doings, I sat on the box beside my father,
and criticized his style of driving. Nobody
can drive brilliantly through snow; but I
was irreverent enough to think that my
father's left hand was hardly sensitive enough
for the work he had to do. However, we
got home with no particular mishap; and I

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

was quite prepared to take the reins if my
father had broken down.</p>

<p>All that Christmas we had snow, and a
mighty wood fire burnt in every room of Romayne
Court. During the first week, Uncle
Paul, who was evidently puzzled by the difference
between Algy's school achievements
and mine, set upon me fiercely with mathematical
and classical questions. I determined
to give him tit-for-tat&mdash;for why should
he spoil my holiday?&mdash;so I asked him to
explain passages that have maddened all
the commentators, and to solve insoluble
perplexities in Probability, and to demonstrate
Euclid's twelfth axiom. He gave me
up at last; but kindly offered to teach me
chess. I beat him the first game.</p>

<p>"I can't make out those two boys of
yours," he said to Mamma that evening.
"Rex is almost too quick, and poor dear
Algy is certainly too slow."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

<p>"Rex isn't a bit too quick, Paul," said
my mother. "He's a genius, that's all."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Uncle Paul. "I wonder if it
is so? I hope it is so."</p>

<p>I, who happened to overhear this bit of
dialogue, wondered whether what we call
genius, was usually based on the consciousness
of an earlier life. Did Shakespeare, did
Milton, did Coleridge, remember the life they
led on earth before? The start of a whole
lifetime ought to enable the human racer to
"spreadeagle his horses."</p>

<p>Wintle and Giffard turned up in good
time on Christmas Eve. We were a very
full house .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lots of girls, many of them mere
schoolgirls, fit for schoolboy flirtation. My
father had invited hosts of people, and I
really had very little chance of talking to
Mamma. Kitty, who was growing up only
too fast, was quite the prettiest little girl in

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

the place. Giffard and Wintle both fell in
love with her of course, and both confided
their passionate secret to my inexperienced
ear. It was great fun.</p>

<p>There is a lake at Romayne Court, and it
was thoroughly frozen, and my father
telegraphed to London in his grand way,
for innumerable skates of all sizes and
patterns. They came; the ice was swept,
and down we went; I had never skated in
this life, but I buckled on a pair, all steel
and thin almost as knife blades, and persuaded
Mamma to sit in a chair, and drove
her over the lake at no end of a pace.
Giffard was the best skater among us;
Wintle had never tried it, but he went on
resolutely, and broke many holes in the ice,
and eventually succeeded in keeping erect
for almost two minutes.</p>

<p>Sometimes I used to get a quiet half hour

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

with Mamma of an evening, when everybody
else had dispersed&mdash;the young folk in bed,
Papa in the billiard or smoking-room.</p>

<p>"Your friends are nice fellows," she said
to me that evening as I knelt by her sofa.
"Different in style, but good boys I am
sure. I can't understand how it is you are
in the same class with them, and Algy so
far below. I am very proud of you,
Rex."</p>

<p>I felt a deceitful rascal.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be proud of,
Mamma," I said; "I am rather clever in
two or three things, that's all. Algy will do
very well by and by, and I will do the best
I can for him always."</p>

<p>"I don't think Dot is half as fond of learning
as I was at her age," Mamma said
musingly. "Ah, but she has not such a
teacher; dear Annie teaches well, but I

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

learnt from a man who taught me because
he loved me. I am his spiritual daughter,
Rex: do you know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," was my answer, kissing
her lovely hand.</p>

<p>What a confounded hypocrite and impostor
I am!</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "I often feel as if he
were close to me, as if he spoke to me, as if
he whispered, '<i>I will teach you still</i>.' And it
is strange, Regy dear, I almost always have
that feeling when you are with me. There
is something about you that is like him, I
suppose. O, my darling, grow up as good,
as gentle, as kind, as brave."</p>

<p>As my beautiful Mavis said this, she took
my boyish head into her loving arms, and
pressed me to her bosom. I wished I could
tell her the miraculous truth. I was silent.</p>

<p>Holidays came to an end, and their end is

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

usually miserable. The end of this Christmas
vacation was miserable enough, for there
set in a muggy drizzly dirty thaw, and the
whole world was dipped in soap and water. It
was a most uncomfortable ending to what
had been a very jolly time. Then Algy
caught a cold at the last moment, so we were
kept back, and we were two days later at
Birchanger Park. Now it was Dr. Grindley's
rule, whereof I was unaware, to flog all
boys who came behind time, so Algy and I
had to be flagellated; and Granville, who
was the customary operator on these occasions,
had a fiendish joy in pitching into
me. He wouldn't, if he had known that
the birch twigs impinging on the outside
gave me real delight, as proving that I
actually was a boy again. It was my first
flogging at Birchanger Park; I fear it was
poor Algy's fiftieth, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">SWEET AND TWENTY.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"In delay there lies no plenty;
Then come kiss me, Sweet and Twenty!"</p>

</div>

<p>AT seventeen I was Captain of the School
and of the Eleven. Giffard was at
the Bar, with brilliant prospects. Wintle
was junior partner in the firm of Wintle &amp;
Co., Russian merchants, Birchin Lane. Kitty
was a flirt. Algy was in the fifth form.
Just then arose for me a difficult situation.
An anonymous letter reached me at Birchanger
Park; it was brief enough:</p>

<p>"<i>Take care of your silly sister</i>."</p>

<p>The handwriting, cramped and quaint,

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

was entirely unlike any that I knew. Was
it a friendly warning, or a scoundrel insult?
The epithet applied to Kitty rendered the
latter more likely. However, I determined
to act in the matter.</p>

<p>Dr. Cicero Grindley wisely gave his sixth
form plenty of freedom. His theory was
that when a boy reached the upper level of
the school his manliness and self-control
should have a chance of development. I had
kept a horse at Birchanger Park ever since
I entered the Sixth, and used to ride over
to Romayne Court whenever I had a fancy.
There was only an hour's work with the
Doctor on the day when I received this
laconic letter; the notice paper on the classroom
door contained only two items.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Sixth Form</i>.</p>

<table>

<tr><td>XI .&nbsp;. XII.</td><td>Dr. Grindley.</td><td>Probability.</td></tr>

<tr><td>II .&nbsp;. III.</td><td>Herr Grutschk.</td><td>Faust."</td></tr>

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

<p>The worthy German's prelections I had invariably
shirked; but I never shirked the
Doctor, specially when he took up a topic so
dear to him as that Land Debateable between
mathematic and metaphysic. He was
most lucid and logical this morning on the
method of least squares, a perfect demonstration
of which I have never seen in print.</p>

<p>When the lesson was over, I went up to
the Doctor and told him I was going over to
Romayne Court, and might possibly want to
stay the night.</p>

<p>"By all means, Marchmont," he said.
"Take your time. I am accustomed to trust
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," I said, and had my
horse saddled, and was at Romayne Court
in twenty minutes. When I had sent my
horse round to the stable, I strolled up
through the grounds. The house was full,

<!-- vol 3 page 93 -->

evidently. Gay groups were on the lawns
and terraces, and there were white sails on
the lake, and an effervescent mixture of gay
music and light laughter floated in the air. I
wondered what it meant.</p>

<p>Instead of going straight to the house, I
strolled through the grounds, and looked
curiously at the various groups of gaily-dressed
people who passed to and fro between
shade and sunlight, and marvelled
what had induced my father to have this
superb entertainment, and why Algy and I
had heard nothing about it. At last,
after loitering through the grounds
without meeting anyone I knew, I sat down
in an arbour dark with yew, where an
alley of that slow-growing evergreen crossed
the garden. In this shade there were many
loungers, and I caught some of their talk.</p>

<p>"So Marchmont really expects to get in

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

for the county," said one harsh unpleasant
voice. "He might as well try to reach the
moon. We must have a gentleman for the
county."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said a voice more musical.
"So long as he gives us pleasant days like
these he is a public benefactor, and he should
have my vote if it were possible for me to
have a vote."</p>

<p>They passed on, these quidnuncs. The
next I heard were voices of ladies, silver-sweet.</p>

<p>"Do you think Kitty Marchmont pretty?"
says one.</p>

<p>"Pretty?&mdash;yes; but she has no style&mdash;decidedly
<i>gauche</i>. What the Duke can see in
her, I am unable to imagine. A man of his
experience ought to have some taste."</p>

<p>"Ravenstower is in his dotage," said the
other. "He would fall in love with any doll."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

<p>"Will he marry Miss Marchmont?"</p>

<p>"My dear! Don't you know he is married
already. He married Lydia Walsh, the
actress, and she is the real Duchess of
Ravenstower; but she despises him too much
to take his title. She won't even receive an
allowance from him. I believe the little
Marchmont girl really thinks he is in earnest,
and she will be a Duchess; but he
daren't marry, and he certainly wouldn't
marry her if he could."</p>

<p>These voices passed also away, leaving me
fierce enough in yew arbour. It seemed that
people were trying to make fools of both my
father and my sister. The Duke of Ravenstower,
a haughty though impoverished noble,
was Lord Lieutenant of the county; he
drank my father's wine, borrowed my
father's money, cast ogreish oligarchic eyes at
my pretty sister. An adroit and elegant old

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

man&mdash;white-haired, but perfumed&mdash;a skeleton,
padded&mdash;with time's losses repaired by
the best artists&mdash;with a courteous manner and
a hugely mortgaged rent-roll&mdash;above all, a
Duke. Little Dot was tempted. She imagined
herself a Duchess already. It was
his notion to set my father to contest the
county: he hoped, while he was busy at this
political work, to come to terms with Kitty.
I walked out from my yew-tree bower, full
of boyish wrath. I crossed the lawn, and
ascended terrace after terrace. Presently I
saw on the higher terrace a group, easily
recognisable. There were my father and
mother; there was Kitty, wonderfully like
what my mother was in her youth, but more
petulant and less intelligent: there was a
tall old gentleman walking with my sister,
and talking with the affected vivacity of an
imagined youth: there was my Uncle Paul,

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

strolling behind, with a look of listless vexation.
He was lagging a few yards behind.
I walked briskly up and joined him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rex," he said, "what brings you
here? Holiday-keeping?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "I rode over to see
how you all are. This is quite a festival.
Does my father want to get into Parliament?"</p>

<p>He looked keenly at me.</p>

<p>"Yes, he does. I wonder at so absurd
an ambition; but he has made up his mind
that it is a good thing to do."</p>

<p>"If I were of age, I'd come forward and
oppose him," I said. "It would be great fun.
But what the deuce does his Grace the Duke
of Ravenstower want here?"</p>

<p>"He wants to marry Kitty, so far as I
understand," said Uncle Paul.</p>

<p>"He is married already," I replied. "He

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

only wants to borrow money from Papa,
and to make Dot his mistress, if he gets a
chance. I am glad I came over to-day."</p>

<p>The light in my eye, my firm lip, my
clenched fist, told my uncle that I was in
thorough earnest.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do, Rex?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to the little book-room," I
said. "Will you try and send Kitty there,
on some pretext or other, within half an
hour?"</p>

<p>"I will," he replied.</p>

<p>I slipped away, unseen by my father and
mother, and took refuge in the little book-room,
which was crammed from floor to
ceiling with books that can be read. I
took up <i>Martinus Scriblerus</i>, and lay back in
a lounging chair and waited. Presently Kitty
entered, looking for a book, apparently.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

<p>"Dot," I said.</p>

<p>She threw up her pretty head with an air
of contemptuous defiance. Ah, Mavis, her
mother, could not have done that. Mavis
was and is too true a lady. Kitty had all
the future Duchess in her, as she looked at
me.</p>

<p>"What do you want, you troublesome
boy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Are you going to be Duchess of Ravenstower?"
I inquired.</p>

<p>"What business is that of yours? His
Grace is very pleasant and nice&mdash;I like his
society. I suppose I may talk to him without
harm?"</p>

<p>"O dear yes, Dot. If that is all, I beg
your pardon. But is it all? Has not his
Grace said something about marriage?"</p>

<p>Kitty began to whimper.</p>

<p>"He said something the other day that I

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

am afraid meant what is very wicked. I
am afraid of him, Rex, I am, indeed. He
is very polite and pleasant and witty, but I
am tired of him: only he pleases Papa so
much, and I don't want to disoblige Papa."</p>

<p>It flashed through my mind at that moment,
how very narrow is the sphere of
common sense! My father is a perfect man
of business, but he would willingly have
thrown his pretty daughter into the arms
of a pauper Duke old enough to be her
grandfather! As if to be a happy wife
were not better than to be an unhappy
Duchess!</p>

<p>"Dot, my darling," I said, putting my
arm round her, "you must have nothing to
do with that fellow. He is already married."</p>

<p>I felt her start.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is quite true! He is a scoundrel,

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

Duke or no Duke! Now, I will tell
you what to do. I want to talk to him;
get him to walk with you through the
rooms, and bring him to the Armoury: then
slip quietly away. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I will." And away she went to do it.</p>

<p>The Armoury had been fitted up by dear
old General Romayne, and contained specimens
of all kinds of weapons. There was the
Lion Heart poleaxe; there was the Roman
pilum; there was the rapier of Toledo;
there was the shillelagh of Ireland. I took
from the walls a pretty pair of rapiers, steel
that you could double without breaking,
and waited for the Duke.</p>

<p>In time he came, entering the door first,
and Kitty slipped away as I had directed.
He did not at first notice her disappearance,
nor did he notice me. He was looking at
the trophies with which the walls were

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

covered. Suddenly he turned to speak to
Kitty, and was evidently surprised at her
disappearance. Turning round, he caught
my eye fixed on him. Now came my time.</p>

<p>"You are a scoundrel, Duke of Ravenstower,"
I said.</p>

<p>A fiery flush came into this haughty
noble's face. Men seldom spoke to him as
to an equal. To hear such words from a
boy amazed him.</p>

<p>"Who are you, you impudent fellow?"
he said.</p>

<p>"I am Reginald Marchmont, brother of
the lady whom you, a married man, have
insulted by your addresses."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he cried, in a fury, "you are
a miserable schoolboy. I will have you
sent back to school and well flogged, you
little fool!"</p>

<p>"Little" was rather an insult, as I stood

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

six foot one in my stockings at that time.</p>

<p>"You may have your choice of these
rapiers, Duke," I said. "You will fight me
before you leave this room. If you refuse,
I will horsewhip you in public. I suppose,
being by courtesy a gentleman, you know
how to use a sword?"</p>

<p>He came forward, white with rage, took
up a rapier, and placed himself in position.
I saw he could fence; but in three things I
was his superior&mdash;length of arm, strength of
wrist, youthful keenness of eye. Twice I
disarmed him; the third time I ran my
blade through the fleshy part of his sword-arm.
He went off to be tended by his
valets, having promised me on his honour
never again to speak to my sister.</p>

<p>Next I found my way to my mother's
boudoir. She was very tired; dissipation
always wearied her. She was dissatisfied

<!-- vol 3 page 104 -->

with my father's political ambition, and with
Kitty's fancy for her Duke. She had hoped
for quiet when she came into the country,
and for that exquisite untrammelled life
which is only possible amid the peaceable
solitudes of nature. That my father
should take a fancy to become member
for the county&mdash;that a Duke should
make love to Dot&mdash;were things of which
she had not dreamt. They destroyed her
delight. I consoled her as best I could,
saying no word of my duel with the Duke.
After a time I went down again into the
gardens.</p>

<p>There was a buzz of gossip on lawn and
terrace. The Duke had ordered out his
equipage, and gone off to Ravenstower without
saying a word to Mr. Marchmont.
This was the story. What could it mean?
Had he been rejected by Miss Marchmont,

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

to whom everyone saw he paid so much
attention? A hundred questions were
asked and were unanswered. There was a
whirl of rumours in the social atmosphere.</p>

<p>Crossing the terrace, I found myself close
by my father and Uncle Paul, who were as
much puzzled as anybody by the Duke's
sudden disappearance. I went up to them.</p>

<p>"You here, Rex," said my father; "why,
I thought you were hard at work at your
Latin and Greek at Birchanger."</p>

<p>"I only came over for a few hours to
punish a scoundrel, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked my father.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I hope you won't think it
very impertinent; but I have just fought that
fellow Ravenstower, who had the audacity
to make love to Kitty, though he is a
married man. He is gone off, I believe;
I ran him through the arm. It will take

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

him a week or two to get well again."</p>

<p>My father looked perfectly amazed. It
took him some time to become articulate.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"You mean to say you fought a duel
with the Duke of Ravenstower?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and if he were not so old I should
have horsewhipped him. He is simply a
scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"But how came he to condescend to fight
a schoolboy like you?" said my father.</p>

<p>"<i>Condescend!</i>" I exclaimed, indignantly.
"I think mine was the condescension, to
cross swords with such a fellow! It took
him some time to condescend, but when he
saw that if he would not fight he would be
well thrashed, he pulled together his small
remains of courage."</p>

<p>At that moment I saw Dot in the distance,
and went off to talk to her, leaving

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

my father to discuss my oddities with the
ever-sympathizing Uncle Paul.</p>

<p>"Well, Rex?" says Kitty, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Well, Dot," I reply, tranquilly, "what
have you got to say? Are you pining for
your elderly admirer?"</p>

<p>"I hate him!" she answered. "I only
spoke to him because Papa seemed to wish
me to receive him with some courtesy. But
I think he is ugly, even for a Duke&mdash;and I
am sure he is stupid; and I hope&mdash;I do hope
I shall never see him again."</p>

<p>"You never will, Kitty," replied I, "so
don't trouble yourself."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure I never shall?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Quite, child. I have given the fellow a
lesson. He won't trouble you more."</p>

<p>"What a boy you are!" said Kitty. "You
don't mean to say you have said anything to
the Duke of Ravenstower?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

<p>"I don't mean to say anything about it,"
I replied. "He has left Romayne Court,
and will not trouble you any more. Find
somebody else to flirt with, that's a good
girl."</p>

<p>Kitty was indignant, whereat I did not
wonder: Girl Twenty can hardly be expected
without indignation to take advice
from Boy Seventeen. The relation between
brother and sister is very useful, and
therefore, like all useful things, very beautiful.
A sister may teach a brother many
valuable lessons in the fashion and fantasy
of life; a brother may teach his sister what
it is that men adore in women. What is it?
Caprice? Beauty? Wit? Grace? Temper? No:
these are all in perfection delicious; but what
a man adores in a woman is that ideal innocence,
that sweet chastity of spirit, which
he knows for himself unattainable. And, if

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

happy enough to achieve the marriage of
completion, he knows that one-half of him
is pure. The dearer half of him lives in
the realm of light. He must perforce
grope in the twilight of the world sometimes,
but she need never forsake that calm
abode of clarity in which she was predestined
to dwell.</p>

<p>That Dot had been intoxicated by the
foolish fancy of becoming a Duchess is
quite clear, but my straightforward statements
on the subject had some of the power
of Ithuriel's spear: and she beheld Ravenstower
in his proper shape, a battered old
<i>rou&eacute;</i>, without an ounce of honour or conscience.
She was rather shamefaced about
it, and lost for the time a little of her vivacity;
but the people staying at Romayne Court
all imagined that she had refused the Duke,
and so she had rather a social triumph.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

<p>That evening, as I next day learnt from
my uncle Paul, he and my father had a
long and serious colloquy on the general
situation. Everybody had gone to bed except
a few loiterers in the billiard and
smoking-rooms. I was one of the latter:
of course it was a point of honour to smoke
at Birchanger, since it was rigidly prohibited.
My father seemed perfectly amazed
at the promptitude of my action with regard
to the Duke.</p>

<p>"The boy was right, Paul, and I was
wrong. I had no notion he was so full of
fire. He ought to do well."</p>

<p>"He won't do on the Stock Exchange,"
said Uncle Paul. "What shall you make of
him? He ought to go to College."</p>

<p>"I must think about it. One thing is
certain: I may as well give up standing for
the county, after this row with old Ravenstower.

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

I can't succeed without his help."</p>

<p>"You would not have succeeded with it.
The sitting members have more real influence
in the county than the Duke, who is
so pressed for money that he lets his farms at
a rack rent. I am glad you will give up
the idea: you can do much more good as a
county gentleman than as a member of the
House. Mavis, I know, will be delighted."</p>

<p>"By Jove," quoth my father, in his usual
rapid way, "I'll go and tell her at once.
She won't be asleep yet. Good night,
brother Paul."</p>

<p>Off he went, and uncle Paul strolled into
the smoking-room, where he found me, and
seemed a little surprised. There were some
odd people here to-night, two of whom I
specially remember. One was an American
gentleman, Colonel C&aelig;sar Goff, who drank
so much whiskey and smoked so many cigars

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

that I was quite appalled. His skin was the
colour of old parchment; his nose was hooked
like a vulture's; his voice was a vulture's
scream. The other oddity was a slim young
man, who wore gold spectacles, and who
was called Professor Wrightson. What he
professed I don't know, but he talked
omniscience. He lisped a little and stuttered
a little, which did not prevent his
chattering faster than anybody I have ever
met. Between him and the Colonel I was
pretty well stunned. A Niagara of words
poured into each ear. While on the right the
Colonel was eloquently narrating his exploits
in the wild regions of America, on
the left the Professor was talking politics,
theology, chemistry, finance, and comparative
anatomy, all in a breath.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said Colonel Golf, "when
that bar (he meant bear) saw me coming

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

with my rifle, she ran off lumbering to protect
her cubs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"But that locomotive engines will be
driven by the heat produced when potassium
takes fire on the surface of water, is, I
think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>This was the Professor.</p>

<p>"And the old he-bear came down from
the hill on me with tremendous precipitation.
I thought my life was lost; however,
I had a revolver .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"A new method of destroying armies is a
want much felt, and I think I have found a
chemical agent by which fifty thousand men
can be destroyed ten miles off at a cost
of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"My revolver burst! Imagine my horror!
The old bear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"I mean to offer my invention to the
War Secretary, who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

<p>I smoked tranquilly, mixing the sayings
of my two neighbours in rather a complex
way. It did not matter: the fictions of a
bragging hunter did not mingle badly with
the fictions of a blundering scientist. When
uncle Paul entered, sitting down apart from
the general crowd, I was not sorry to join
him. He lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"When are you going back to Birchanger,
Rex?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow afternoon, I think, sir. To-morrow
is an off day. I can stay as late as I
like."</p>

<p>"Your father is rather astonished at your
fighting propensities. I think he wants to
talk to you after breakfast about your future
career. Do you feel disposed to become a
stockbroker?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. That will suit Algernon
perfectly. He was born to be a stockbroker."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

<p>"That is fortunate; you, I suppose, would
like to go to College and complete your
education, before absolutely deciding what
you will do."</p>

<p>Now I had thought this matter over, and,
while I had some hankering after the indolent
quietude of cloister and quadrangle,
I felt that it would be a dreadful bore to
go over ground again that I knew perfectly
well. Pretending to learn what I knew already
had been good fun at school, but I
had had quite enough of it. The active and
originative tendencies were strong in me. I
said:</p>

<p>"No, uncle, I think not; I know as much
as I want to know. I should prefer to
travel through England a little before deciding."</p>

<p>"Through England? Not abroad?"</p>

<p>"Not at present: I want to see England

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

and the English people. It appears to me
that there is more to be learnt in this way
than universities can teach me. I am quite
willing to work hard when the time comes,
but I should like a year or two to think
about it. At present my idea is to be either
an architect or a soldier."</p>

<p>"You are an odd fish, Rex," said my
uncle. "We will see about it to-morrow.
Good night; don't sit up smoking any
longer."</p>

<p>I was about to follow my uncle's example
and go to bed, when Professor Wrightson
intercepted me. Looking round, I perceived
we were the only persons in the room; the
smokers had gradually melted away while I
was talking.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">A SCIENTIFIC MARVEL.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Nec te Pythagorae fallant arcana renati."</p>

</div>

<p>"DO you believe in metempsychosis?"
asked Professor Wrightson. "Excuse
my abrupt way of asking questions, but
I judge from your conversation that you are
no sophist, but a true philosopher."</p>

<p>What a character one gets by being a
good listener! My chief conversation that
evening had been puff after puff of the regalia.
But the Professor's question rather startled
me, considering what I actually knew. Was
this man something more than a mere

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

sciolist? Could he have any inkling of my
wondrous experience?</p>

<p>He induced me to sit down and talk
awhile, and have one more glass of something
cool. He broke into strange paradox.</p>

<p>"All things in nature, I hold, are capable
of flux and reflux. The modern theories
of development are only a part of a much
wider theory. Humanity is Protean.
There is no reason in the world why, if we
desire to do it, we should not develop
wings in our children, if not in ourselves,
and make the air our highway. Let us
take a lesson from the bees, marvellous
geometers, marvellous physiologists&mdash;of
whom Virgil admirably says,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'His quidam signis atque haec exempla secuti,
Esse apibus partem divinae mentis et haustus

Terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum.'</p>

</div>

<p>They change the sex of their offspring

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

when necessary, by administering particular
food. Now, can you keep a secret?"</p>

<p>The Professor paused, anxiously.</p>

<p>"O yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"I am trying a similar experiment. I
was born a female; I am gradually developing
myself into a male. Whiskey and cigars
I find the best means of doing it. When I
have fully carried out my scheme, I shall
patent it. It will be a fortune. Just think
of the number of women in England alone
who are pining to be men. I should charge
a hundred pounds each&mdash;dirt cheap, you
know&mdash;and if I metamorphose ten thousand
women in the first year, that will be a clear
million."</p>

<p>The Professor spoke with such an air of
absolute conviction, that I did not know
what to make of him and his theory. I
went on smoking.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

<p>"The gradual change in me is very
curious. But that it was requisite to keep
the experiment secret, in view of the various
prejudices of mankind, I should have had
myself photographed at different stages of
progress. This I shall certainly do with my
clients, when my scheme is matured. The
power of mind over matter has never been
thoroughly recognised, still less understood.
It is capable of entirely changing the aspect
of the world."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind has ever been done
before," I remarked.</p>

<p>"That proves nothing, if even it be true.
There must be a discoverer of all nature's
arcana. But discoveries may be forgotten
and remade. Could the Pyramids and
Stonehenge have been built without steam?
Were there not steamships in Homer's time?
As to my theory, what is the meaning of

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

the myth of Proteus, of the Centaurs, of
the Amazons? Depend on it, the antique
poets knew something of that law of universal
change which I am gradually and painfully
establishing.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," was all I could
reply. The man looked so confoundedly
in earnest, that I saw clearly he was either
a sage or a madman.</p>

<p>We talked for some time longer&mdash;into
the small hours. The Professor was a
fascinating talker. If what he said was
incredible, he invested it with a halo of
plausibility. There was a curious magnetism
in the man (or woman?) and he told
me stories of mesmerism, spiritualism,
and other preternatural wonders, such as
transcended anything I had heard before.
I don't know whether I had drunken too
much brandy and soda, or smoked too

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

many cigars, but I felt in an offuscated state,
and as I listened to this epicene professor, I
was as much under his influence as those
who heard the story of the Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p>The sleepy footman waiting in the anteroom
must heartily have wished we would
go to bed: but Professor Wrightson's talk
flowed on like an endless stream, and I felt as if
to interrupt it were impossible.</p>

<p>Suddenly interruption came. The sleepy
footman threw open the door, and two stalwart
men entered. The Professor, who was
so seated that he could see the door, sprang
to his feet and gave a tremendous yell like an
Indian war whoop. Not one yell, but an infinite
series, each of which seemed louder than
the last. I was wide awake now, but had no
time to interrogate the intruders, who had got
hold of the Professor in about half a minute,
and rendered him powerless with a strait

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

waistcoat&mdash;not, however, before he had abortively
hurled a soda-water bottle at them,
smashing a large mirror on the wall. He
went on yelling, and to such a purpose that
in a few minutes the smoking-room was full
of half-dressed people.</p>

<p>My father came forward and said, as
well as I could hear him for the Professor's
yells,</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this disturbance?"</p>

<p>"Very sorry, sir," said one of the men,
"but this gent is a lunatic, escaped from
Dr. Middleton's. I don't know how he got
in here, but he's terrible cunning. We've
been looking for him near a fortnight."</p>

<p>Only too true. A cunning lunatic (he had
been a tutor originally, and overworked a
rather weak brain) had contrived to pass
muster among my father's guests. He had

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

also talked to me a great deal of rubbish
which, in that smoking-room atmosphere, I
took for high philosophy. As I reflected on
this adventure in the solitude of my own
room, where I found it unnecessary to light
a candle, so bright was the full moon, I
thought both my father and I had made mistakes.
He had kept too open a house: I
had kept too open a mind. Neither is wise.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">A CONCLAVE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"This place [Milton's ideal Academy] should be at once
both school and university, not needing a remove to any
other house of scholarship, except it be some peculiar college
of law or physic, where they mean to be practitioners: but
as for those general studies which take up all our time from
Lily, to commencing (as they term it) master of art, it
should be absolute."</p>

<p>BREAKFAST next morning was a most
amusing assemblage. Everybody was
full of fun or curiosity or both. Plenty of
chaff flew about as to the varied and not always
sufficient costume worn by those whom
the Professor's indefatigable ear-splitting yells
had brought into the smoking-room at dead
of night. We came to no definite theory as

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

to the meaning of these yells, and of the scene
generally, so a whole bundle of imaginary
hypotheses were brought out for our benefit.
My father did not appear. A long
course of early rising in connection with the
Stock Exchange had caused him to like indolent
fashions for a change: he and my
mother usually breakfasted in his own rooms,
even when the house was full of company.
The guests had their option of breakfasting
where they liked and when: and indeed
it was always understood at Romayne
Court that dinner was the only set meal.
<i>Fay &ccedil;e que voudras</i> was the motto at all
other times.</p>

<p>I lounged into the garden after breakfast,
amusing myself with the bizarre recollections
of the night precedent. My father, an experienced
man of the world, was the last
person in whose house you would expect to

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

find an escaped lunatic. As for me, having
had seventy-seven years of remembered life,
and having been a student for many years
of the time, it seemed odd that I should be
taken in by the extravagant platitudes of a
maniac. I felt slightly ashamed of myself.</p>

<p>In the garden I met my uncle Paul, who
told me that Dr. Grindley was coming over
in the afternoon, and Algernon with him,
and that there would then be a serious discussion
as to the future proceedings of us two
youngsters. Hereat I was well pleased: I
wanted something settled. I was specially
anxious to transfer stockbrokery to Algy,
who I knew would acquit himself well in
that line of business.</p>

<p>The conclave met. My father and mother,
Uncle Paul, the Doctor, Algy, and I. We
were requested to state our wishes. I repeated
mine.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

<p>"I wish to be an architect or a soldier.
I do not wish to decide at once. I want to
study England first."</p>

<p>"You would rather not be a stockbroker?"
said my father.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir."</p>

<p>"And you don't want to go to college?"
asks my uncle.</p>

<p>"I would much rather not."</p>

<p>Now Dr. Cicero Grindley held Milton's
opinion, that colleges would be unnecessary
if schools did their duty to the full, and I
had unconsciously enlisted him on my side.</p>

<p>"Marchmont major is right," he said.
"Give him four years more with me, as a
private student, and I will engage to teach
him both architecture and the art of war.
After that he can carry out his excellent
plan of studying England, for which as yet
he is too young."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

<p>"This sounds rather unpractical, Doctor,"
said my father; "but I am a great believer
in your judgment, and I wish both the
boys to have their way in the world, within
reasonable limits. What do you think
about it, Paul?"</p>

<p>"I think," replied my uncle, "that Rex's
fancies are not unreasonable, and that under
Dr. Grindley's guidance he may do well.
You must keep a tight rein, Doctor," he
continued, "for I see the boy is full of wild
ideas that demand restraint. Don't let him
imagine himself a man before his time."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that," quoth the Doctor,
rather grimly.</p>

<p>"Now, Algy," says my father, "it is your
turn. What do you want to be?"</p>

<p>"A stockbroker, Papa, and as soon as
possible. I am tired of school."</p>

<p>"What say you to that, Dr. Grindley?"

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

said my father, while Algernon looked on
with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"I think he chooses rightly. He will
make a good man of business, I judge: and
it is not too early for him to begin."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said my sire. "I'll send
him up to town this week. Why, Reginald,
Algernon will be a man before you have
left school."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," I said. "I should like
to be a boy as long as I possibly can."</p>

<p>My mother gave me an approving smile.</p>

<p>The result of this conference was that I
returned to Birchanger Park with Dr.
Grindley, and that Algy went to some court
in the neighbourhood of Throgmorton or
Threadneedle Street, where Messrs. Marchmont
&amp; Co did mysterious business. At the
end of the current term I vacated my position
in the sixth form of the school, remaining

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

as the Doctor's private pupil. That
omniscient indefatigable man taught me
architecture with the enthusiasm of Ruskin,
and the art of war with the energy of my
Uncle Toby. And I had plenty of football
and cricket, of riding and rowing, and spent
four of the jolliest years I remember in all
my experience.</p>

<p>Why did I do this? it may be asked. I
wanted to prolong my boyhood. Now,
reader, I put the matter to you&mdash;whichever
sex you belong to. Suppose you had once
been a boy, and become a man&mdash;or once a
girl, and become a woman&mdash;and were
fortunate enough to get a second innings as
a boy or girl&mdash;wouldn't you retard your
development into manhood or womanhood
as long as possible? I did. I fear that
many a time I shocked dear Dr. Grindley,
which was a great shame: but I positively

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

could not control my animal spirits. I,
who ought, as he gravely and sadly said, to
show a good example to boys younger than
myself, was always leading them into mischief.
It was too true; I positively could
not help it. How the Doctor tolerated me,
I could not imagine, except that he delighted
in my intelligent appreciation of his prelections
on architecture, (&AElig;gyptian, Etruscan,
Greek, Gothic, <i>κ. τ. λ.</i>) and the art of
war (from the club of Cain to the last refinement
in artillery).</p>

<p>Yes, I was a nuisance. Now, here is a
case in point: Tom Wetheral had succeeded
me as captain of the school. We two, and
Ralph Pollock of the Sixth, formed a triumvirate.
It occurred to us one day that we
should like some devilled turkey. About
four miles off, Farmer Cullamore had a fine
brood of white turkeys: we resolved to steal

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

one. Off we went at sunrise one autumn
morning, and picked out a splendid cock,
and had just put him to a prompt and easy
death, when the screams of the rest of the
flock brought out the farmer's daughter, a
buxom wench of five-and-twenty. These
white turkeys were her peculiar care. She
came rushing out across the garden into the
field beyond, with nothing on but a chemise
and a petticoat. She used emphatic language.
I immediately kissed her; so did
Pollock. Tom couldn't; he was embarrassed
by the turkey. Off we ran homeward.</p>

<p>Of course Farmer Cullamore turned up
at Birchanger in the course of the morning
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not, however, before we had surreptitiously
devilled our turkey, and found it
devilish good. He used stronger language
than his daughter, talked seriously of sending
for the police, and identified us without

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

much difficulty&mdash;for the old boy was shaving
at his bed-room window when we committed
the theft, and nearly cut his throat
in his rage when he saw me kiss his
daughter.</p>

<p>"The boys shall all be well flogged," says
the Doctor. "And they shall pay you the
value of the bird, Mr. Cullamore."</p>

<p>"No, thank ye, Doctor," replies the
worthy farmer. "Let 'em have their
whacking: they deserve it: I won't have
their money."</p>

<p>And off he went.</p>

<p>The Doctor gave us&mdash;me especially&mdash;quite
a pathetic lecture, before he pitched
into us. I was always sorry for the dear
old boy, for he could not of course understand
the reason of my wild proceedings.</p>

<p>"I say," cried Pollock, when our little
business was over, "old Grindley picked

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

out some of his A 1 birch this time. I
shan't sit down for a week."</p>

<p>As for me, I that evening committed
another escapade. I rode over to Wingfield
station, left my cob at the Railway
Inn, and took train for London. I was just
in time to have supper at Evans's with
comfort. I slept at the Tavistock, and
breakfasted on a lobster. What a thing it
is, after having been a man, and reached
the age of jaded appetites, to become a boy
again, and feel the joyous boyish hunger
for lobsters and mischief, for rhubarb tarts
and pretty girls. After breakfast I drove
to Bond Street, and expended ten pounds
in a very elegant bracelet.</p>

<p>Then, finding myself in London, and
knowing that I should get into difficulty on
my return to Birchanger, I thought I
would amuse myself. I rushed down into

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

the City and called on Algernon. Wasn't
he surprised and disgusted! I had on a
straw hat, an old velveteen shooting jacket,
cord trousers, heavy walking shoes. Algernon
had the finest blue cloth coat, the most
perfect canary-coloured waistcoat with
diamond buttons and a massive watch-chain
for adornment, trousers of a light lavender,
patent leather boots. He didn't know what
to say to me. He got me out of the office
as soon as he could, and asked me if I would
like to have some lunch.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," I said. "But how are you
getting on, old fellow? Do you really <i>like</i>
this sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Do you really like
staying at school when you ought to be of
some use in the world? I can't understand
you, Reginald."</p>

<p>Talking thus, we had got into Leadenhall

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

Street, and were in front of the "Ship and
Turtle."</p>

<p>"Come in and have a bottle of champagne,
Algy," I said. "You don't understand
me, but I quite understand you. We
shall get on very well, by-and-by."</p>

<p>We had our bottle of effervescent wine,
and Algy's share was quite as much as he
could carry.</p>

<p>"I believe you're a dev-dev-lish good fel-fel-low,
Rex," says he, as we parted near
the Bank of England. "Take my heart
and lute&mdash;no, I mean my best wishes and
kindest regards&mdash;to old What's-his name.
Good-bye: I've got to bear some stock."</p>

<p>I hope he beared it all right.</p>

<p>I went to Covent Garden and ate peaches.
I lounged about the West-end, and wondered
if any of the old gentlemen in club
windows of White's and Brooks's and

<!-- vol 3 page 138 -->

Boodle's were old enough to remember
Ned Ellesmere. By-and-by, I started homewards,
and got to Birchanger in the afternoon.
To my great satisfaction, the Doctor
was out: he had gone away early in the
morning.</p>

<p>There was nothing to prevent my walking
over to Farmer Cullamore's&mdash;I did so.
It was a pleasant stroll, under hedgerow
elms, through meadows abounding in mushrooms.
I did not, however, go the whole
way. Crossing by a stile from a field-path
into a shady lane, I came suddenly upon
Julia Cullamore, the young lady whose turkey
I had stolen and devilled&mdash;whose lips I
had audaciously kissed. She was a fine
girl, and looked at me with a mixture of
anger and admiration. What could I do
but kiss her again? She did not scream.
It is within the limits of possibility that,

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

having reached the mature age of twenty-five
amid a population of young farmers,
she might have been kissed before.</p>

<p>"Miss Cullamore," said I, "it was very
wrong of us to kill your turkey."</p>

<p>"Father says you'd get well whipped for
it," she rejoined. "I hope you did."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cullamore, I really don't
think you ought to allude to such a very
sore subject. I prefer to forget such unpleasant
accidents."</p>

<p>"O, you talk fine. 'Tain't so easy to
forget a good sharp smacking&mdash;I know that.
But I'm going home again; so, good-bye."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," I said. "Your father
would not let us pay for the turkey, so I
have brought you a little present. Will you
wear it?"</p>

<p>I clasped the bracelet on her reddish
wrist. White stones and green shone amid

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

the gold&mdash;emerald and aquamarine. The
girl was delighted. She looked at the
bauble, as it circled her arm, with an almost
infatuate air. Then she said, looking at me
earnestly,</p>

<p>"You may kiss me again, if you like."</p>

<p>As I walked home to Birchanger, I
speculated somewhat sadly on the state of
England's rural intellect. Alas, I fear the
municipal intellect is not much better. And
yet England is, without dispute, the world's
foremost nation.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" thought I, "they manage
things better in Mars."</p>

</div>

<p>I THINK Dr. Grindley was not sorry
when the time was over for cramming
me with architecture and the art of war.
He certainly dismissed me in the second
week of June, 1861, with an air of satisfaction,
promising however that he would

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

infallibly be at Romayne Court in time for
my coming of age. O dear, that coming of
age! Fancy twins coming of age, and one
a stockbroker! I was in terror&mdash;mortal
terror. I felt fain to run away until it was
over. Algy, on the other hand, looked
forward to the affair with great delight;
and walked about the grounds, rehearsing
to himself the speech he intended to make.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had much talk with Kitty,
who showed eagerness to give me her confidence.
I was quite surprised that my
sister, with her beauty and wit and certainty
of wealth, had not yet married. She
talked over the matter with me, of her own
accord.</p>

<p>"Rex," she said&mdash;we were under a great
oak in the park, and there was a superb
sunset, and the deer were curvetting wildly&mdash;"I
don't think I shall ever marry."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

<p>" 'Nobody asked you, sir, she said,' "
was my rude reply.</p>

<p>"O indeed! A great many have asked
me, Rex, and some of them very nice
fellows; but I have a kind of feeling that I
could never live with anybody who had a
right to control my actions. I should like
to be quite independent. I can't marry
without love: and I don't believe I am capable
of loving in the true sense of the word.
I have studied the matter, Rex: I have read
all I could find about love-making. There's
<i>Romeo and Juliet;</i> very pretty verse, you
know: but Romeo and Juliet strike me as a
couple of foolish children, who ought to be
whipped and sent to bed. It is all like sucking
lollipops. Somebody recommended me,
the other day, to read <i>Henrietta Temple</i>, as
being the most delicious of love-stories: I
can't make out which is the greatest goose,

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

Henrietta or her Ferdinand. That's a
couple of examples: it seems to me incredible
that clever men like Shakespeare and
Disraeli could sit down and write such
nonsense."</p>

<p>"Well, Dot," I replied, "I do not entirely
agree with you. There is such a thing as
real inalienable love, the result of two
people meeting who are absolutely fitted
one to the other. For every male soul a
female soul is waiting. They may never
meet: or, if they meet, they may be sundered
by misfortune. If you should never see
the man you can accept as lover and master,
I advise you to retain your independence.
There is no reason why a woman should
not lead a happy life amid such circumstances.
A perfect marriage is perfect
happiness: better not to marry at all than
marry imperfectly."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

<p>"How wisely you talk, Rex!"</p>

<p>"Don't I? I've got the gift of the gab,
and the gift of prophecy. I'll bet you a
diamond ring to a pair of gloves that you'll
be in love before I come of age."</p>

<p>"You wild boy!" she said. "Come, it
is late; we must dress for dinner. Now I'll
run you to the wicket gate if you'll give me
two minutes law."</p>

<p>"All right," I said.</p>

<p>Off she started, agile as a deer; showing
strong fine ankles as she ran through the
fern. Alas! I too easily overtook her, and
had vaulted the gate from the park into the
gardens before she reached it.</p>

<p>"You're a wretch, Rex," she said.</p>

<p>"Remember our bet," I retorted. "I
mean to win those gloves."</p>

<p>When I got to my room, I forgot to dress,
and sat ruminating on the state of affairs.

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

Why didn't Kitty marry? I never saw a
prettier girl except her mother and my
lost Lucy; but the right man for her did
not seem to arrive. My father meant to
give her fifty thousand&mdash;as I knew and as
a good many people guessed. Yet here
she was, at four and twenty, unmarried, and
thinking she should never marry.</p>

<p>So long did my cogitations last that the
second dinner gong sounded, and I had not
thought of preparation. I was too hungry
to care about this; so I hurriedly washed
my hands, and got down stairs just in time
to take into dinner a particularly prim maiden
lady, old enough to be my grandmother.
She scarcely touched my arm with the tip
of her gloved finger; no wonder&mdash;I had on
an old purple velvet shooting coat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. purple
originally, but now blending all the colours
that glorify the woods in autumn. If a

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

painter could paint that coat, he could paint
sunset. The superb ladies and gentlemen
at the dinner table looked puzzled. Kitty
laughed, for she knew my absent ways.
Algernon, with the squarest of white ties,
and quite a bouquet adorning the silk lappel
of his Savile Row dress-coat, looked rather
shocked. Capel Court is a hothouse for
delicate plants.</p>

<p>It was a dull dinner. There were too
many people. The old maid whom I had
taken in to dinner was silent all the time,
opening her mouth only to eat, which she
did with a vengeance. To compensate, on
my other side was a youthful widow of forty-five,
who marked me down as her prey,
and who talked more in a minute than
Charles Matthews as <i>Captain Patter</i> could
talk in an hour. She set her cap at me in
the most amusing style; talked of her little

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

place in Kent, <i>so</i> charming, with <i>such</i> lovely
grounds, and <i>such</i> nice society in the
neighbourhood; said that her late husband
had been a deep disappointment to her, and
that she now was pining for a congenial
spirit, who would make her life happy.</p>

<p>"And O how happy I would make him!"
she exclaimed, gushingly.</p>

<p>"Won't you take some grapes?" I asked.</p>

<p>She gave me up, after that, and turned
her artillery on a stout rubicund gentleman
of twenty stone and thrice as many years.</p>

<p>I did not that evening go into the drawing-room.
I played a game or two of
billiards with Captain Harris, who always
went to his billiards the moment wine-drinking
ceased. That he beat me easily <i>va sans
dire</i>. To be supreme at billiards (or anything
else save one) you must work every
day; and I have intense pity for the man

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

who works every day. Mr. Bagehot notwithstanding,
I believe that science, if widely
developed and wisely applied, could
abolish hard work.</p>

<p>I strolled off to the smoking-room, as
some men came in who might give Harris
the invincible a trifle more trouble. Nobody
was there. I lighted a cigar, and lay on a
couch, and indulged in reverie. It was not
of the future, as might be expected from a
youngster just coming of age; it was of the
past in Earth, the past in Mars; it was of
Lucy; it was of Alouette.</p>

<p>As I lay ruminating the door opened;
entered my uncle Paul (who had been in
London all day) and a friend. They did
not see me; I was meditating in a remote
corner. I could observe them at my leisure.</p>

<p>My uncle's friend was the handsomest
ugly man I ever saw. His hair was black

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

horse-hair, and too much of it; his feet were
beetle-crushers, and too much of them. His
nose was a queer combination of hook and
snub; his two eyes never looked the same
way; his mouth was immensely large,
with the right-hand corner up, and the
left-hand corner down; he had a stubbly
grey moustache, and a short iron-grey
beard; his arms and legs were both a great
deal too long for him. But those ill-matched
eyes had strange keenness and wonderful
depth of colour; and that vast mouth had
marvellous power of expression; and when
I heard the man speak, I felt that I had never
before realised the possible music of the human
voice. I would rather hear him speak
than Mario sing.</p>

<p>"So here we are at last," said Uncle Paul,
throwing himself lazily down. "As we've
missed dinner, suppose we have a devil sent
in here?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

<p>"Right," replied the stranger.</p>

<p>A footman was in the room, and the order
was given.</p>

<p>"Tired?" said my uncle.</p>

<p>"Never was yet. Only impatient. Want
to get at the last act of 'Beauty and the
Beast.' "</p>

<p>"It will soon come," quoth Paul Marchmont;
"and the curtain will drop at the
right moment."</p>

<p>The stranger unexpectedly lifted up that
mellow voice of his, and carolled, <i>ex improviso</i>,
and to a tune that seemed to have been
made on the spur of the moment, and to
have been considerably torn by the said spur.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O, there was a Beast most frightful,
    A million years ago,
Who dwelt in woods delightful,
    And found it very slow:
            And he barked, or brayed,
            Or whinnied, or neighed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
'O, all that I want is a lovely maid
    With breasts of rosy snow!'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 152 -->

<p class="stanza">"O, there was a damsel of Beauty,
    Like grapes in their autumn glow,
And she thought it was her duty
    The meaning of this to know:
            And she never ceased
            To look at the Beast,
Till she went one morning to fetch the Priest.
    Were they married?&mdash;I hope 'twas so."</p>

</div>

<p>I rose from my corner and came forward,
as the footman entered to take my uncle's
orders.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rex," said uncle Paul, "you here?
Why not among the ladies, as is the manner
of youth?"</p>

<p>"Not in the humour to-night, sir," said I.
"Thought I would come here and smoke a
solitary cigar, and ruminate on the possibility
of coming of age without making a
fool of oneself."</p>

<p>"Misanthrope or misogynist or both?"
said my uncle. "No matter. Wake up
now and amuse us. We are going to sup

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

in a corner. We desire not to enter the
halls of white waistcoats and white satin. This,
Rex, is Mr. Eustace Perivale, Queen's Counsel.
And this boy, Perivale, is one of the
twins that is painfully coming of age."</p>

<p>"Would it be considered irreverent,
uncle," said I, "if I were to throw you out
of window?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly," said Uncle Paul; "especially
as there is supper on the road. Wait
till that important meal is finished. Afterwards
we may perhaps enter into questions
of casuistry."</p>

<p>The ugly Q.C. made a tremendous meal.
He got some excellent claret with his grill,
but he positively had the face to grumble.</p>

<p>"There is but one liquid worth drinking,
Marchmont," said he, "and that is London
stout. It beats the best port in the world.
You know my little place at Beckenham?&mdash;I

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

have had a silver tube laid down from
there to Whitbread's brewery, and they pump
a constant supply of their best stout."</p>

<p>"That silver tube must have cost something,"
said my uncle, gravely.</p>

<p>"Only a Roman Catholic infant, in
Chancery," replied Perivale. "Lord bless
you, Paul, you've no idea what a lovely
profession the law is! Litigation is a perpetual
epidemic. If you can only make the
worse appear the better reason, you've a
fortune&mdash;a perennial income in the palm of
your hand. Only one can't be honest."</p>

<p>"Awkward!" said my uncle.</p>

<p>"Don't agree with you," said the Q.C.,
after swallowing a tumbler of champagne.
"I think the lawyers have the best of it,
and are more honourable than people of
any other profession or vocation or trade."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

<p>"As thus. The lawyers <i>can't</i> be honest.
Granted. Understood. Agreed. But other
men, from the parson to the costermonger,
<i>could</i> be honest if they would, but they <i>won't</i>.
Now, Paul, my boy, which is the sheerest
rascal, the man who can't be honest, or the
man who won't?"</p>

<p>"Casuist!" quoth my uncle. "Come, I'll
leave it to my nephew. What say you,
Rex?"</p>

<p>"I say, sir, that a man who deliberately
takes to a profession in which he can't be
honest, must be either a fool or a knave;
and I am told there are very few fools in
the profession of the law. The difference
between lawyers and other people seems to
be this: others will be honest when honesty
pays, but a lawyer would magnanimously
lose money to gratify his lust for dishonesty!"</p>

<p>ALGERNON and I were very much
alike; but I was an inch taller, and
several inches more round the chest, and
had a ruddy country skin, whereas his complexion
was of the Burlington Arcade type.
My hair was a curly mop: his savoured of

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

Truefit. As to dress, why, he was the <i>petit
ma&icirc;tre</i> of the City&mdash;the Capel Court dandy;
while I could, by no process or persuasion,
be brought to dress elegantly. Comfort
and convenience were my idols. I was
very glad to quote the example of Eustace
Perivale, Q.C. He also dressed as he liked,
did what he liked, behaved like a chartered
libertine. I noticed he talked a deal to
Dot.</p>

<p>One day he came to me down by the
lake, where I was mooning about, and abruptly
said,</p>

<p>"Marchmont, should you object if I
were to ask your sister to marry me?"</p>

<p>I looked at him for a moment. That
grotesque face of his was graver than common.
There was a light in the eye, a tremor
on the lip.</p>

<p>"Why ask me?" I said.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

<p>"Because you are the only person who
needs asking, except Mrs. Marchmont, and I
dare not approach her yet. Now come, old
fellow, tell me what you think. I am
devilish ugly, I know; but I can wile a
bird out of its nest, or a verdict out of a
jury. I saw Miss Marchmont at the Opera
one night last season and was hit hard. It
took me an immense time to find out who
she was. But your uncle and I are of the
same club&mdash;the Chandos, and so I managed
to get at the fact. He brought me down
here. I have seen Miss Marchmont, but
have said no word to her. When I last
spoke to your uncle on the subject, he said&mdash;'<i>Talk
to Rex</i>.' Now, my dear boy, I
<i>must</i> have your sister: she is the only woman
in the world I could love."</p>

<p>"She'll have fifty thousand pounds, Perivale,"
I said.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

<p>"Ha!" with a deep sigh. "I wish I could
get your father to keep that fifty thousand
pounds till we want it. I'm making twelve
thousand a year, and refusing briefs right
and left. I've refused a judgeship twice."</p>

<p>I laughed inwardly. I acknowledged the
strength and nobility of the man, cased grotesquely:
the question was, would Dot similarly
appreciate him? After a moment's
reflection, I said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Shall I talk to my sister, Perivale? Or
do you prefer to go straight to her yourself?"</p>

<p>"I never saw judge or jury I was afraid
of," he said, "but I am rather afraid of Miss
Marchmont. You know I'm ugly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
damned ugly; and she is O so beautiful!
The world never saw anything like her."</p>

<p>I thought of the infinitely higher beauty
of my pupil, Mavis Lee.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

<p>"Well," I said, "I'll go and talk to Dot
the first chance."</p>

<p>"O I wish I might call her Dot!" whispered
the sore-stricken Queen's Counsel.</p>

<p>Kitty was out that day&mdash;at a garden party
in the vicinage. When she came home it
was late: dinner was long over: my mother,
always early, had gone to bed. I had given
orders that my sister's arrival should be mentioned
to me: and a servant brought the
news as I was just finishing a game of billiards
with the Q.C., who played abominably.</p>

<p>When I went up to the child's boudoir,
there she was, in a pretty undress, tired evidently,
yet with the light of a past enjoyment
in her lovely eyes. Pleasure and fatigue are
twins, fatigue a moment later born.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rex," she said, with a gay smile,
"have you come to lecture me? You
schoolboys think you know everything.
Come, what is it?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

<p>"Have you still quite decided to be an
independent old maid, Dot?"</p>

<p>"O dear no! I saw a lovely curate and
a most exquisite ensign at our party to-day.
They both made love to me. They both
lisped. They both blushed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. much better
than I could."</p>

<p>"Will you blush if I mention the name of
Eustace Perivale, Dot?"</p>

<p>"O Rex! He <i>is</i> so good, but I don't
think I am good enough for <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, you are," I said. "Your
very faults are beautiful in his eyes. But
you told me not long ago you could never
love anybody&mdash;and that you could never
obey anybody."</p>

<p>"Did you never alter your mind, Rex
dear?" she asked. "I had never seen anybody
then that I could love, or that I should
like to obey. I have now. <i>Rex!</i>"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You'll tell papa, won't you?"</p>

<p>"O yes."</p>

<p>"And, <i>Rex!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Tell Eustace I'm gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Ay, I'll tell him that, and a lot more
that will drive him half mad."</p>

<p>"You wretch! <i>Rex!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, you monkey."</p>

<p>"Isn't he most delightfully ugly?"</p>

Which, being divine, is utterly unchangeable.</p>

</div>

<p>EASY as was the distance from Romayne
Court to Five Tree Hill, I only rode
over two or three times during my school-days.
In truth, my first visit disgusted me.
There were no coaches now on the road, no
merry bustle at the Romayne Arms when
the guard's horn was heard in the early
morning, and all the outside passengers wanted
lamb's wool. The natty little inn of my
memory had degenerated to a wayside public-house,

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

whose occupier could scarcely
live. It was kept by a fellow called Eastmond,
who was always intoxicated.</p>

<p>Beau Sejour was closely shut up, and I
could neither obtain access to it, nor ascertain
to whom it now belonged. After
wandering awhile in the shadow of Saint
Apollonia's Chapel, I rode back disgusted.
The dream of my former life was harshly
dispelled. Once or twice afterwards I rode
over, but the place was melancholy; it was
like entering a chamber where you had left
the woman you loved, happy and full of
life, and finding her a corpse. I was not
particularly sentimental, for my second
boyhood seemed to neutralize my previous
manhood, even as complementary colours
produce white light. So, finding that I
could not satisfactorily renew my reminiscences
of Five Tree Hill, I gave it up and

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

enjoyed my school life&mdash;played cricket and
football, and wrote Greek verse, and drank
for a second time the new clear unfermented
wine of life. I wish I had power
to efficiently describe the intense delight
which I found in passing through a second
boyhood with a clear recollection of my
first. No man can understand the taste of
good wine who has drunken but one bottle;
or can know what poetry is, having read
but one poem, however good; or can intelligently
appreciate the beauty of woman,
having seen but one woman in the world.</p>

<p>The problem came often into my mind,
after I had left school and made some
slight progress into the deeper waters of the
world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Can I love again?</i> Perchance,
to the ordinary reader, this may seem
absurd: but I was unable to forget Lucy,
whose pure and beautiful soul had vanished

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

from the earth with mine. Ah, where had
that sweet spirit dwelt all these years?
There is no identifying a disembodied and
re&euml;mbodied spirit. Surely there ought to
be a spiritual telegraphy, whereby two
severed souls could hold communion, though
one were in Sirius and the other in Aldebaran.

<p>Now, if I could only have found Lucy, I
should have been happy. But here was I,
after wandering through another planet,
again cribbed and confined by the stringent
laws of earthly necessity. I could not
break those laws, except by committing
suicide, for which I felt not the slightest
inclination: so I determined to take matters
with a calm philosophy, and to go on my
travels in search of adventure.</p>

<p>I was much amused at the way in which

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

I was evidently regarded by my immediate
relations. My father thought me a fool of
genius, and, as he had plenty of money, and
more common sense than any man I ever
met, he determined to let me sow my wild
oats in my own way, believing that, the
process over, I should grow reasonably
wise. Having a model stockbroker in Algy,
who already was making quite a sensation
in Capel Court by the originality of his
devices, he could afford to let me run wild.
My mother's judgment of me was rather
mixed. I was her favourite boy; I learnt
all she taught me so readily&mdash;and why not?
since I had taught her: but there seemed in
her mind sometimes a kind of perplexity
about me. With my knowledge of the
facts, I often wondered whether there was
a kind of half-memory of the past which
flashed upon her in moments of the clearest

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

intuition. Did she sometimes vaguely
dream of Five Tree Hill, and the old quaint
house, and Saint Apollonia's Chapel,
and her tutor?</p>

<p>My uncle Paul, I am certain, thought
there was about me something unusual and
not at once explicable. He never said a
word, but I often perceived that he was
puzzling himself about me. <i>What</i> he
thought, I cannot say: he is one of the most
reticent of men: also he is one of the most
persistent in pursuit of the clue to any difficult
question. I do not at this moment
know whether he has reached a conclusion:
this true story might help him, but I perfectly
well know he won't read it. Because
it is in three volumes he will think it is a
novel, and be quite unaware that it contains
the verification and rectification of an ancient
philosophic theory.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

<p>Algernon thought, and still thinks me, a
fool. Dot&mdash;well, I don't quite know Dot's
thoughts&mdash;but one day, when I had been
giving the lovely light-hearted child a lecture,
she said,</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Rex, you talk as if you
were a thousand years old."</p>

<p>And really Dot, though three years my
senior, seems quite a baby to me. As my
father kindly and wisely left me to my own
devices, I carried out my project, and walked
through England. I decided to walk,
because it secures a man perfect independence.
Possibility of accident varies as the
square of the number of integers: if a man
rides, he is four times as likely to get into
difficulty as if he walks.</p>

<p>My adventures during this period would
make a book in themselves, and can by no
possibility be narrated here. All this time,

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

while I was traversing the dear old land,
with open eyes for its beauty and character,
open ears for bird-music and human wit,
open nostrils for odour of rose and meadowsweet,
Algernon was upbuilding a colossal
fortune for the great firm of Marchmont &amp;
Co. Algernon was a director of the Bank
of England before I had made up my mind
to be anything. In my desire to be either
an architect or a soldier, I had scientifically
examined all the cathedrals and all the fortifications
in England, and had reached the
inference that the cathedrals were better
than the forts.</p>

<p>I was at home at intervals&mdash;indeed, I had
a grand time of it when Dot became Mrs.
Perivale. The Stock Exchange was grandly
represented, and the presents that came from
the Stock Exchange would have been welcomed
by a bride of the Blood Royal. My

<!-- vol 3 page 171 -->

gift might have been unique. A week or
two before the wedding, I was sitting on a
stile near Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire.
It was green summer weather: the foliage
cooled the eyes: the turf cooled the feet.
A bird sang. I looked up in surprise.
Never had I heard that peculiar bird-note,
which I am not musician enough to jot down,
except in Mars. The lovely singer rose into
ether, with a sunset on his wings, and as
he rose he dropped something that looked like
a star as it fell on the grass. I searched for
it: it was a thin gold ring with one sapphire
in it about the size of a sixpence, cut <i>en
cabochon:</i> and in the very core of that sapphire
was a single point of red, as bright as
fire&mdash;and, as I afterwards found, light-giving
in the depth of darkness. I divined at once
that this was a gift from the good old King
of Mars, designed for my sister's wedding day.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

<p>I put the ring on my little finger, and
walked on toward the tavern where I
designed to sleep. I never wear a ring, so
I was fidgetted by this one, and turned it
round and round on my finger. As I
crossed a pleasant meadow-path, I saw a
country love-making couple coming toward
me. Just as I passed them, the boy said to
the girl:</p>

<p>"Why, I thought I saw a gentleman
coming along the path. Didn't you, Bet?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I did, sure. A tall man he was.
O, I'm afeard, Tom. It must have been a
ghost."</p>

<p>I had stood still within a yard, and was
listening to them. They could not see me.
Connecting this phenomenon with the ring,
I noticed that I had turned the stone inside.
I shifted it to its proper place. The
young woman suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

<p>"Why, there's the gentleman, Tom! We
was looking the wrong way."</p>

<p>Walking on towards my inn, I tried the
stone, and found it efficient. I walked up
to a bull without his knowing it, and caught
a partridge that was lying snug among the
turnips. When I reached the little inn at
which I meant to sleep, I entered unseen.
Clearly, this ring had magical powers.</p>

<p>"Shall I give it to Dot?" I thought, as I
sat over my tough mutton-chops and Coliseum
sherry&mdash;"shall I? Why, what may
the young monkey be tempted to do, if she
finds she can at will render herself invisible.
The eleventh commandment&mdash;Thou shalt
not be found out&mdash;is rendered nugatory by a
ring like this. No, by Jove, I'll keep it
myself."</p>

<p>I did, and gave Kitty instead the finest
set of pearls in Europe. I don't believe

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

they are paid for yet. I have the ring to
this day, and am extremely glad I did not
give it to Kitty. It might have demoralized
that child, and I have found it useful.</p>

<p>Wandering still from place to place in
England, whenever the weather was fine, I
walked one day into the principal inn at
Redborough. I was going home to
Romayne Court: but a long day's walk had
tired me, and I thought I would dine and
sleep there and go home next morning.
When the morning came, I felt enterprising,
and determined to pay one more visit to
Five Tree Hill. The ghost of Doctor
Romayne, the memory of Mavis and of
Lucy, seemed to drag me thither. I had
reason to be glad that I went.</p>

<p>The Romayne Arms was as dull as
ever, but I entered it, inspired by a kind of
intuitive curiosity, and learnt from the stolid

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

landlord that there were some ladies staying
for a time at Beau Sejour.</p>

<p>"Real ladies, your honour," says the
landlady. "I can't make out the names,
and the groom is that short he a'most bites
your nose off: but they're real ladies, and
no flies."</p>

<p>I told this chattering Mrs. Eastmond that
I should want a bed that night, and then I
strolled down that steep hill-side, where the
foliage was heavier now, where I had
walked so many many years. This path I
had walked with Mavis. In that room
whose windows I could see, shining in the
westering sun, Lucy had held my dying
hand. The old house had life in it now. I
longed to enter it, and see.</p>

<p>After lingering at the gate, I descended
to Saint Apollonia's Chapel. As I went
down the hill I felt a strange magnetism.

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

Something drew me forward. You see the
quaint old chapel of the dentist-saint some
time before you reach the foot of the hill;
and on an immemorial stone I saw a woman
sitting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a woman? a girl, but how like
Lucy! The nearer I came the more tremulous
I grew. She was not looking at
me, this child; she was looking at the unutterable
beauty of the sunset. Simply
dressed, she was; a girl-woman; brown-haired,
with fleck of gold that seemed alive;
eyes bluer than the bluest summer sky; a
sweet spiritual flexure of motion; a wonderful
inborn life and light that flashed
through and through her. She was dressed
in pure white, with one royal red rose in
her bosom.</p>

<p>I do not think any moments of any life
of mine as yet gone through were so calmly
enjoyable as while I leaned on the old

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

lichen-grown rough stone wall, and looked
at this girl. Her likeness to my lost Lucy
was perfect. As I remembered my Thames-side
darling&mdash;ah, how many, many years
ago!&mdash;I can hardly help thinking that here
she is again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. always loving, always young.
Ah, it cannot be! This is some chance
resemblance, nothing more.</p>

<p>I stood watching this girl, with my elbows
leaning on the old stone wall, till the sunset
faded, and the sky grew grey, and she, with
a slight shiver, rose from her position.
Youthful still, I could not help speaking to
her: she did not seem in the least degree
frightened. I said something about the beauty
of the evening: weather's the king of talk-topics.
She accepted my escort to her garden-gate
with that divine unconsciousness which is
the beauty of serene maidenhood. At that
gate we parted. I said,</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

<p>"I used to know some one who lived in
this old-fashioned house. Might I call to
look at it, do you think? I am staying for
a night or two at the little inn."</p>

<p>And then I told her my name, and where
I lived.</p>

<p>"If Mamma is well enough, Mr. Marchmont,
I am sure she will be delighted," said
the young lady. "She is very feeble and
nervous, but sometimes a new visitor cheers
her up. I will let you know to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>This was at the garden-gate. A full
moon was shining. "The devil's in the
moon for mischief." The moon shone
straight into this beautiful creature's eyes,
and made strong sapphires of them; shone
also on her fair soft skin, and made it
lovelier in its rosy whiteness than ivory
would be if you could distil upon it the

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

ruddy juice of all Persia's roses; touched
her ruby lips with so delicious a dewy light
that, on the honour of a gentleman, I
could not help kissing them. She ran away
into the depths of the shrubbery: I, left
alone, went to the Romayne Arms, ate,
drank, slept.</p>

<p>Dreamt, moreover. In my dreams I
identified this girl with Lucy. Gods, how
like they were! The same colour of hair
and eye, the same sweet fluent movement
of form, of foot, of finger, the same wonderful
translucence of the soul that maddened
me into ineffable love at Twickenham, years
ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that miraculous transparency of
soul, as if Lucy were a lamp of the purest
plate-glass, with the strongest electric light
burning at her heart's core.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza">"A woman who is light from heart to eye,
    A woman who is love from eye to heart;
    That is true beauty. Ah, on life's rough chart
Mark down the place of meeting ere you die,
If you have met such woman. Never sigh
    If she desire you to dwell far apart:
    Just to have made a vein of anger start
In her strong soul is something. Ah, but why
Is it that such a woman seldom sees
    The man of calm imaginative brain.
The man who loves the birds and flowers and trees,

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">GRACE.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet
                Ducere nuda choros."</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN next day I called at Beau Sejour
I was readily admitted. The people
at the Romayne Arms had told me that
the dwellers here were Mrs. and Miss Smith.
The young lady did not strike me as looking
much like what society anticipates from a
Smith, even if there has been metamorphosis
to Smyth or Smythe or Smijth or Ssmith.
However, we have all known some rememberable
Smiths.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. James, Horace, Sidney.

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

It is indeed the greatest of Teuton names.
Smith means smiter, whether on anvil or
on helm of foe: a great soldier was a war-smith
in the elder time. The name is a good
name, by no man to be despised.</p>

<p>Still I felt doubtful whether Smith was
the true name of the languid lady whom I
found in the room I had known so well long
years ago. She had been handsome&mdash;very;
but, ah, she was very, very tired. The light
seemed asleep in her eyes. It was an evident
trouble and weariness to raise her hand&mdash;even
to turn her eyes. I have never seen
anyone who seemed so worn out; and it was
long before her time.</p>

<p>She was indolently courteous. She was
glad I felt any interest in the house. I was
welcome to come whenever I liked. She
had come there for quiet, but she willingly
received an intelligent visitor. Languid and

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

weary as she was, she could be loquacious
on occasion. I, for my part, wondered
whether she would ever drop her garrulity,
and collapse into quietude. I did not see
her often after this, for she was always ailing:
but I did see her daughter Grace. We
had many happy hours together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith was a very sensible woman.
She could not conquer her especial nervous
affection, brought on chiefly by mental disturbance;
and she was most anxious that her
daughter should not suffer by constant attendance
upon her. So, when she saw me, and
saw that I was a man not likely to treat a lady
otherwise than courteously, she gave Grace
leave to ramble about with me, and we explored
the vicinage thoroughly. Given the
Chapel of Saint Apollonia as a centre, and
a radius of five miles will give you, whether
archae-or-geo-or-ornithological, a very fine

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

field of observation. It is a beautifully rich
region. They were expecting me at Romayne
Court, and I saw its sloping roofs
many a time in the sunset, as Grace and I
wandered together: but they waited for me
in vain till I had made myself most intimate
with Grace. I stayed on at the Romayne
Arms, to the delight of the chattering landlady,
and the detriment of my digestion.</p>

<p>How unutterably joyous are the hours
spent in this pleasant way by youthful lovers
whose love is stainless! Although perfectly
happy in the present, reminiscences of the
past and fears for the future troubled me.
Once I had loved and lost what I loved:
now I loved again, a girl so like Lucy Lovelace
that they might have been twin-sisters;
and I often had times of terror lest some
unanticipated misfortune should part us.
Often this fear came upon me at night,

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

driving sleep away beyond the reach of
hope, causing it to fly from my, grasp as a
migratory sea-bird flies far across the distant
hills, and is lost in the vague grey-blue
that follows the sunset. Then, leaving my
room at the Romayne Arms, I would
steal out in the depth of night into the well-remembered
garden of Beau Sejour, and
watch alternately my lady's window, and that
great procession of the stars which he who
knows its meaning can never tire of watching.
Then at sunrise I would go down to
Saint Apollonia's Chapel, and have my
matutine refresher in the clear stream, and
return to breakfast with an amazing appetite.</p>

<p>All this time I had not talked love to
Grace, in any direct way. We were playing
the game in boy and girl fashion. I felt
indeed loth to move too fast: the rapid and

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

prompt love-making of my earlier time had
given place to delight in delay. Grace and
I rambled and loitered, poetized and
botanized: we never seemed to be at a loss
for topics of pleasant chat, though indeed it
was delightful when there came upon us
the silent mood, and we sat hand in hand
upon some mossy bank, watching the lovely
play of the clouds, the endless ripple of the
stream, and wondering why the world was
filled so full of beauty. There was a
magnetism in the touch of our hands which
sufficed to make us both completely content.
I do not remember any moments of life so
peaceful as these. When Grace's tremulous
fingers rested in mine, my fears and my
fancies vanished. It was when alone that
the terrible thought would come upon me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may never see her again."</p>

<p>My relation to this child was duplex. I

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

had the passionate feeling of hot youth, and
could have clasped her to my arms with a
wild impulse of absorption, if I had not
been calmed and controlled by my first,
my elder self. Experience had taught me
that beautiful pure rosebuds should not be
plucked too soon: and I felt the absolute
philosophic. truth of Fouqu&eacute;'s exquisite conception,
Undine, in whom her lover must
create, or rather develop, a soul. My
fancies dwelt in the regions of the higher
love-poetry: I was in a Spenserian rather
than a Shakespearian mood. But in Grace
there was more than in gentle Edmund's
Una: there was more than in any of Shakespeare's
women, not excepting even my
favourite Rosalind: there was that luminous
transparency of character which I had never
seen in any woman save my lost Lucy.
And she had the same magnetism: not living

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

creatures only, but the very flowers seemed
to know her: the robin was more familiar
than with anyone else, the shy-eyed wren
stole near her unstartled, the dragon-fly lay
on a leaf while she stroked it with velvet
fingers: she could handle bees unstung, and
any flower she tended gave far fairer bloom
than those left to the old gardener's watering-pot.
Well had she been christened
Grace.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,
In all her gestures dignity and love."</p>

</div>

<p>It became necessary for me to show myself
at Romayne Court, or my folk (though
uniquely tolerant of my eccentricity) would
begin to marvel at my absence. Thus had
I meditated on one of the mornings after a
sleepless night. As I walked up Five Tree
Hill I saw an unexpected sight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a mail
phaeton stood at the gate of Beau Sejour, a

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

footman holding the horses' heads, while
another footman stood at the cottage gate.
It was a well-appointed equipage, and plenteous
silver gleamed upon the harness of a
noble pair of roans. I grew alarmed. Who
could thus be calling at so early an hour on
simple quiet Mrs. Smith?</p>

<p>Of course it was out of the question for
me to call and inquire, even had I been in
suitable costume: but I was very loose and
damp, cravated with a towel, so I made my
way back to the inn. Looking from my
bedroom window, just as I had finished dressing,
I was rather surprised to see my brother
Algy. He was strolling up and down as
if waiting for somebody; and there was a
curious complacent look on his face, which
I had often noticed when he thought he
was doing something clever. Having no
particular wish to see him at that moment,

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

I sat down by the window and smoked.
Presently the mail-phaeton I had seen at
Beau Sejour gate drove up to the inn door:
the driver was a very handsome aristocrat of
fifty perhaps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at any rate his hair and
moustache were white. He got out of the
carriage with difficulty, and walked quite
lame. My brother came up to him, and
through the open window I heard him say,</p>

<p>"I hope your interview was satisfactory,
my lord."</p>

<p>"What a fool you are, Marchmont!" he
said, in a voice so harsh that it resembled
nothing so much as a coffee-mill. "Nobody
ever yet had a satisfactory interview with a
woman&mdash;and nobody ever will."</p>

<p>Algernon took his snubbing with angelic
submission, and followed his lordship into
the inn. I of course did not go down. In
about twenty minutes they came out and

<!-- vol 3 page 191 -->

drove away, and it was pretty clear they
were going to Romayne Court. Then I went
down and found a little note on my breakfast
table. It was from Grace. It ran
thus:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Rex</span>,</p>

<p>[I had taught her to call me Rex, and I
called her Regina&mdash;and fifty other foolish
fantastic names],</p>

<p>"Please don't come to see me for a few
days. Some one has called who has made
Mamma very ill, and I must not leave her
till she is better. You know how nervous
she is. I can't tell you anything about her
trouble, for I only half guess myself, and
perhaps I am quite wrong.</p>

<p>"I will send a note the minute poor
Mamma is well enough for me to see you.
You won't go far away, will you?</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Regina</span>."</p>

<br/>

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

<p>Well, I wrote the poor child a note, and
then I started for Romayne Court, thinking
that I might as well put in an appearance
during this opportunity, and that I might
also approximate to a solution of the mail-phaeton
mystery myself. Of course I gave
strict orders that if any note came for me in
my absence, it should be sent on by instant
courier. My little girl should not wait for
me a moment.</p>

<p>Walking into the pleasant lawns of
Romayne Court, dusty-footed, knapsack on
shoulder, I looked somewhat unlike the
probable inheritor of that domain. It was
now afternoon: I heard chatter and laughter
and clatter of balls. The girls were out at
croquet. The bishop of the Diocese, whose
croquet is as orthodox as his theology, was
carrying everything before him. Bishop
Lyndon is the best ladies' man on the

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

bench, and writes the loveliest album
verses. At an acrostic or a charade
he is unrivalled. Here is Kitty's "copy of
verse:"</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Kitty is beautiful and young,
I am, alas, a world too old
To celebrate her locks of gold,
To tell the music of her tongue,
Yet she might make Methusaleh bold!"</p>

</div>

<p>Kitty and the Bishop were in full flirtation
as I crossed the croquet lawn. I did not
go up to the gay group, but Dot saw me as
I passed through a yew archway, and
came flying after me, and gave me a shower
of kisses.</p>

<p>"O Rex, I am so glad to see you. What
a wanderer you have been!"</p>

<p>"Mamma well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Very; I think she has never been in
higher spirits. Uncle Paul said the other
day at lunch, 'I wonder where Rex is?'

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

'O,' said mamma, 'he's safe enough. We
shall see him soon. I dare say he's making
love to somebody.' Papa laughed."</p>

<p>"I hope Perivale is here, Dot," I said.
The young monkey pinched me.</p>

<p>"No, he is not; but he is coming to-morrow,
the dear ugly old boy."</p>

<p>"And you like him still?"</p>

<p>"Don't I? He is so clever. I used to
think you clever, Rex, but he knows everything.
And then he is so modest and gentle
and brave. I say, Rex dear, don't tell anybody&mdash;I
mean him to be Lord Chancellor."</p>

<p>"Well done, Dot!" said I; "a capital
Chancellor he'll make; there's not so able a
lawyer in England. I shall see you a
peeress yet, my child. By the way, is Algy
here?"</p>

<p>"O yes. O, I want to tell you. Algy
came this morning with an old gentleman in

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

a carriage and pair, and they had a long
talk with papa; and the old gentleman is
staying here, but keeps to his own rooms,
and nobody is told his name. Isn't it
mysterious?"</p>

<p>"He may be one of Algy's stockbroking
friends," I said, "who has reasons for being
out of the way. Never mind. Tell me if
you hear anything. Go and amuse the
Bishop: I must put myself in order, and
then see the mater."</p>

<p>Dot ran back to her episcopal croquet, and
I went to my rooms. It appeared to me
there was something odd about this mysterious
stranger&mdash;something rather beyond
a stockbroking complication. The man looked
unlike a stockbroker, and Algy had my-lorded
him. Why was he at Beau Sejour?
How had his call made Grace's mother
ill? These were the problems which I

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

tried to solve as I splashed and dressed.</p>

<p>My mother was alone in her own apartment,
and we had our tea and gossip together.
Between her and me was always
full intellectual accord. She was the most
willing listener to my stories of mild adventure.
I resolved on this occasion that I would
tell her about Grace. I put it all before her
as well as I could, and did my best to describe
the peculiar unique beauty of my darling.
She seemed quite to understand.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rex," she said, "she will be a dear
daughter, I know: but you must not let her
make you forget me. It is very wrong,
Rex, I know; but I can't help loving you
better than Algy, or even Dot."</p>

<p>Did I wonder?</p>

<p>THE day after my arrival at Romayne
Court my father and I had a brief conversation
in his private room. He was in
the best of temper. Indeed it was a very
rare thing for him to be otherwise: if a man
who has perfect health and prosperity, and
the best wife in the world, cannot maintain
an equable temper, who can? Yet we know
that many of the most fortunate men in the

<p>"Rex," he said, "I am glad to see you
again. You have been quite a wanderer. I
hope you have enjoyed your time. Some day
I suppose you will think of settling down;
but there is no hurry&mdash;not the least hurry.
Algy has been so successful that he is quite
independent of me, and will be richer than
ever I have been: and Dot is engaged to marry
Perivale, one of the most rising men at the
bar: so you can go on taking holiday as
long as you like. Indeed, unless you have
some special fancy for occupation, I don't
see why you need be anything but a country
gentleman. This estate is quite enough for
one man to manage, and I think the position

qualified to effect. I want a perfect picture
gallery and a perfect library: but really I am
a mere ignoramus in pictures and books."</p>

<p>It certainly struck me that these ambitions
of my father's were far wiser than his happily
short-lived fancy for getting into Parliament:
and I responded to them with enthusiasm,
feeling quite willing to terminate my
wanderings, now that I had seen Grace, and
loved her.</p>

<p>"By-the-way, Rex," said my father,
"there is a gentleman staying here who
wants to be <i>incognito</i> he is down on some
family business in which Algy is helping
him, and does not wish his name to be

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

known. So, when he is introduced as Mr.
Johnson, don't say anything if you should
happen to have met him. I don't care
about that sort of thing myself: but Algy is
a long-headed fellow, and I let him have
his way."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to know him," I said,
"for I have few acquaintances: but, in any
case, his secret is safe with me."</p>

<p>When I left the paternal presence, I
strolled into the gardens, which were in
exquisite beauty, and enjoyed the odour
and colour of innumerable flowers. There
was nobody in the grounds yet; our guests
for the most part were lazy, and lingered
long over their luxurious breakfast. As I
was rambling in a reverie, a lovely white
figure came gaily tripping over the grass&mdash;it
was Miss Dot, in some ethereal white stuff,
rather like a cloud-fleece, sprinkled all
over with bows of blue.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

<p>"I expect him every minute, Rex," she
cried.</p>

<p><i>Him!</i> When a girl expects all the world
to recognise <i>Him</i>&mdash;and indeed thinks <i>Him</i> the
only <i>He</i> in the world, things look serious.
This was Dot's case. I tried to chaff her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he won't come."</p>

<p>"O, won't he? Don't you talk nonsense
to me, Rex. Ah! there he is!"</p>

<p>He was. A burly broad-shouldered
ugly resolute eloquent man, striding across
the lawn as if he were after the grouse.
Dot ran into his arms without hesitation.
She was not a bit ashamed of her love, dear
child!</p>

<p>"Ha! Rex, I am glad to meet you here.
May I have some breakfast? Came away
without any, for I had to read a lot of
briefs last night, and this morning I had no
appetite. I knew I should be all right

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

down here; and I'm as hungry as a hunter
now."</p>

<p>"Dot will give you breakfast, and feed
you with kisses, I doubt not, if you think
you can live upon them. Tell them to
send something up to your own little room,
Kitty, and I'll come and play propriety, and
drink a glass of seltzer."</p>

<p>Dot's sanctum was in a turret&mdash;hexagonal&mdash;with
three windows. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="fig08.png" />
</p>

<p>E D is the entrance from the house: F A,
A B, B C, are embayed windows, looking
far over park and woodland, and fertile
country sprinkled with villages clustering

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

around ancient churches, and one great
town, and one great river running to the
sea. F E and D C are exquisitely filled
by full-length life-sized portraits of my
father and mother on panel. From B C
there is a capital view of the main terraces
on the south front of the house. I
sat at the open window, while Dot gave
Perivale his breakfast and he gave her his
pleasant flattery, and watched the groups now
coming out to enjoy the summer sunshine.
Perivale had come with a field-glass over
his shoulder&mdash;it was a first-class Dollond,
with which I could scrutinize the faces of
the people as if they were close to me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
far better, indeed, since they did not know
I was looking at them, and therefore did
not put on the mask of hypocrisy. There
were among the crowd few people whom I
knew: but I liked examining the pretty vain

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

girls and the simpering self-satisfied swells,
and trying to guess at their character. I
wonder whether the seraphs similarly amuse
themselves in looking through glasses of
immense force at the population of a myriad
orbs.</p>

<p>As I looked at the second of the three
terraces, my father and Algy and "Mr.
Johnson" came into focus. They were
talking with curious earnestness. Algernon
was the chief speaker; he was intensely animated;
he talked fast, gesticulated, looked
like a French orator. My father and Mr.
Johnson seemed well pleased with all he
said.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at, Rex?" asked
Perivale, suddenly. He and Dot had
noticed my interest in the scene.</p>

<p>"See for yourself."</p>

<p>I handed him the glass, and pointed out

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

to him the group of three. He examined
them long and steadfastly; then he said,</p>

<p>"Who is the grey-haired man with your
father, Rex?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Johnson, I am told."</p>

<p>"<i>Duplex nomen malum omen</i>," quoth
Perivale. "I have known him by another
name. He is one of the most remarkable
men in Europe, and one of the most unscrupulous.
I hope he does not want to borrow
money of your father?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. The old boy can afford
to lose a little, I suppose. But can't you
tell me more about this fellow, Perivale?
What's his true name?"</p>

<p>"You've a right to know. Rex, but don't
ask me to tell you this minute. He's a peer,
he's a poet, and used to be enormously
popular&mdash;long before your time."</p>

<p>"Much you know about my time," I
thought.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

<p>"He wrote the maddest possible poetry&mdash;really
good, you know, but fiercely mad&mdash;all
because he was afflicted with a squint.
Otherwise he was a splendid-looking fellow,
but he still squints a little, though he has
been tortured horribly by an infinite series
of operators for strabismus. After every
operation he wrote a madder poem than
the last: and all the young ladies were in
love with his verse till the sentimental style
grew suddenly fashionable. When he
found his books wouldn't sell, he quarreled
with his publisher, and horsewhipped him,
for which he was brought into Court, and
had to pay heavy damages. Meanwhile,
he had married .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lady of great beauty
and intellect and wealth&mdash;but of a somewhat
pious temperament. It was what I
call the disease of piety, born from physical
weakness of the nerves. They were utterly

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

unfit to live together; he, robust and
fearless, but savage through his physical
ailment: she, a nervous creature, to whom,
a ray too much of sunshine, or a note too
much of music would be a positive distress.</p>

<p>"They separated. I don't think they
had any children. He went in for all sorts
of excitements. He threw away the greater
part of his estate at the gaming-table;
then he tried keeping race-horses, with
the hope of recovering himself: and you
may easily imagine the result. Then he
went in for railway and joint-stock speculation&mdash;and
I believe he is there now.
Perhaps that is what he wants to talk to
Algernon about."</p>

<p>"You would rather not tell me his
name?" I said.</p>

<p>"Not to-day&mdash;you will know it soon
enough."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

<p>"Does he know you personally?"</p>

<p>"O yes, and I mean presently to take an
opportunity of speaking to him, if I get a
chance. To say truth, Rex, I am not over-pleased
to see this man here, so intimate
with your father and brother. They are
able men of business, no doubt: but his
cunning and plausibility are quite without
parallel. What I think of doing is, to meet
him as if by accident, and see if I can elicit
from him any hint or outline of his plans."</p>

<p>This was accepted as really a first-class
idea: I knew Perivale's wonderful talent
well, and trusted him fully, so I said,</p>

<p>"Do as you like: only don't waste too
much time upon it, to Dot's detriment."</p>

<p>Whereon Dot pinched me severely.</p>

<p>That afternoon I rode over to Five Tree
Hill, and saw my Grace on the lawn at
Beau Sejour for two or three minutes. She

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

was a little fagged by nursing, and I heartily
wished I could help her. Mrs. Smith
seemed no better at all, and the child was
in real distress: she did not know any of
her mother's relations: she did not even
know whether her father was dead or
alive. It was a lonely position for her; how
I wished I had a legal right to help her! I
resolved that the attainment of such a
right should not long be postponed.</p>

<p>Evidently there was something in her
mother's illness which embarrassed her, for
she told me as little as possible, and she
seemed almost glad for me to go away.
Well, I could forgive her, knowing there
must be some trouble that she could only
guess, or that she dared not tell. I did my
best in our brief interview to console her,
and I think I did not altogether fail. Dear
Grace! how her luminous  beauty haunted

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

me as I rode home against the soft south
wind.</p>

<p>I had only just time to dress for dinner.
Coming in as the company moved, I took
down Miss Azura Primer, a tall young lady,
with the most audacious assumptions and
the most ineffable ignorance that ever were
combined. She was sallow, freckled, lean,
bony, awkward. She informed me that
she was chairwoman of a School Board
(at least she would have said so if
School Boards had been invented), and
that she had written a treatise on the
Integral Calculus. I listened as little as
possible: it was a large party, which I hate.
I amused myself with a slice of undercut of
sirloin, and with watching Dot and Perivale,
who were happily niched together, a little
farther up on the other side.</p>

<p>These huge parties are an abomination

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

when they come often. If the dinner is a
nuisance, the withdrawing room is worse. I
do not endorse Mr. Austin's line .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Where the half-drunk lean over the half-dressed,"</p>

</div>

<p>for drinking too much is a rare offence&mdash;I
sometimes think only too rare. <i>In vino Veritas</i>.</p>

<p>The billiard and smoking-rooms also become
an abomination when a large country
house is very full. The bad play in the
former&mdash;the stupid and sometimes vulgar
talk in the latter&mdash;are enough to make a
man despise and even detest his species. As
I walked off to my room that evening, I
ejaculated .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear father, if I succeed you
here as manager of affairs, I won't fill my
house so full, and I'll choose my people
better."</p>

<p>The fact is, my father has always been too

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

good-natured. It is a miracle it didn't ruin
him. Perivale came to see me just as I had
got into my dressing-gown, and had lighted
a cigar and taken down a volume of
Swift.</p>

<p>"I'll have a cigar with you, Rex," he said.
"Just one, and a final drop of Cerevisia
Hibernica. Look here, I have been talking
to Mr. Johnson. He recognised me; he
begged me not to tell anybody who he is.
He innocently told me all his plot. Shall I
reveal?"</p>

<p>"It is a subtle case of casuistry," I gravely
said. "It may be resolved on the ninth
formula of Adrianus de Verona: '<i>Whosoever
obtaineth a secret which is important to a
friend, should at once communicate it to his
friend</i>.' "</p>

<p>"You may laugh," he said. "Now look
here. There is, from Mr. Johnson's confidential

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

statements to me, a scheme between
your father and Algernon and him to carry
out a double marriage. He is to marry
Kitty."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I said. "Kitty is yours."</p>

<p>"Ah," he replied, with a melancholy
look, "that's the scheme, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Dot and I will upset that scheme, my dear
Eustace, I can tell you. I don't understand
my father's weakness, except that he has
come to believe Algernon infallible. I'll
soon set that right, old boy. What else?"</p>

<p>He grasped my hand, gratefully.

"Well," he said, "your brother is to have
Mr. Johnson's daughter as a per centage on
the negotiation."

"Will she be rich?"

"By-and-by, I believe. But then, you
know, Mr. Johnson is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Who the devil is Mr. Johnson?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

<p>"<i>The Earl of Lesbury</i>."</p>

<p>It struck me like a shot. Several things
became clear at once.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, old fellow," quoth I to the
Q.C. "I must think this over. I can foil
them."</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">SHARP WORK.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"What thou doest, do quickly."</p>

</div>

<p>I SUPPOSE I inherit some of my father's
promptitude. I thought this matter out.
I did not go to bed. Early in the morning
I ordered out a waggonette and a pair of
horses and drove over to Five Tree Hill. I
saw Grace. Her mother was better, but
still very unwell: indeed it was clear enough
that her ultimate recovery was impossible.
However, to-day she was quite cheerful, and
very willing that my beautiful darling should
taste the fresh air in my company.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

<p>We went down to Saint Apollonia's
Chapel. Doubtless the saintly destroyer of
neuralgia looked kindly upon us that day.</p>

<p>Ah, it was a merry morning. The lark
sang in the very same note as when Romeo
mistook him for the nightingale. Grace was
as happy and as gay as that wild soarer to
the sky. I thought of Goethe's lyric:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O maiden! maiden!
    How love I thee!
How shine thy sweet eyes!
    How lovest thou me!</p>

<p class="stanza">"So the lark loveth
    Air and wild song,
And the morn-music
    Heaven's clouds among."</p>

</div>

<p>It is not every day one meets the absolutely
simple and innocent child who
has never learnt to reason, but whose atmosphere
is purity, and whose instincts are
love and disdain.</p>

<p>We wandered along the rivulet's margin:

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

ah, how often had I wandered that
self-same way with Mavis Lee! But change
had come over the scene: I thought of the
immortal Persian wanderer who found a city
where there had been the sea when he last
went that way, and a few centuries later a
forest where there had been the city.
I am afraid my darling Grace often found
me dull: for my fancy would often go off
into the past, and my casuistic intellect
would perplex me as to my proper relation
with Mavis Marchmont&mdash;my pupil of Five
Tree Hill, my mother now.</p>

<p>Of course I understood, since my talk with
Perivale, why Grace was so like my lost
Lucy. She was her granddaughter. Perchance,
I thought, Lucy's lovely spirit had
passed into the daughter of her son. If so,
how well should I be rewarded for my sad
loss in the olden time! But to verify this

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

idea there was no way. The soul loses its
memory in its transit. My exceptional case
had few precedents .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if any since Pythagoras.</p>

<p>"Grace," I said, after plentiful pleasant
nonsense, "you and I are very good friends,
but I have never asked you a question
which I have long decided to ask you. I
have put off asking it because I think I
know what the answer will be. But now
there is a reason why I must ask you at
once."</p>

<p>The beautiful girl was sitting on a grassy
knoll beneath an oak of wondrous girth.
She had taken off her gipsy hat, and was
swinging it by its ribbon. She looked at
me with a merry defiant smile, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"If I ask you a question, will you say yes
whatever the question is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!" she said, putting her

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

pretty little pink hand in mine. "O, I
know your question, and I know the answer&mdash;and
you may talk as much as you like, but I
understand what your eyes say. Now, sir, if
you want me, here I am; if you don't, throw
me away."</p>

<p>How lovely she was, with her pretty gesture
half-love and half-defiance!</p>

<p>"Grace," I said, holding her hand, and
looking into the lucid depths of her luminous
eyes, "you won't be frightened, will
you, at what I want you to do?"</p>

<p>"Frightened!" she answered. "No,
Rex, <i>you</i> won't frighten me. I will do
anything you command."</p>

<p>"You will marry me to-morrow, and say
nothing about it."</p>

<p>"What fun! Where is it to be? I am
quite ready."</p>

<p>The affair was easily settled. I got home
to dinner, having arranged to meet her next

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

day and drive her to Redborough, having
also made the requisite arrangement for a
special license. I was quite resolved not to
lose this beautiful heiress of Lucy's wondrous
charms: I was delightedly resolved to foil
my brother Algernon.</p>

<p>The evening was dull to me, but rather
pleasant, I think, to most of the company;
for the jovial Bishop was there, who played
croquet and chess, who made epigrams and
enigmas, who in fact established the Church
on a basis wholly his own. Here is a
charade which he wrote in Dot's album that
evening:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Ah, fiercely my First
    Has demolished the foe,
When the wild battle-thirst
    Brought ineffable woe.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Ah, slowly my Second
    Demolished my First:
My Second is reckoned
    Of evils the worst.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

<p class="stanza">"Ah, my Whole you will curse,
    Though your taste of it's cursory:
It makes everyone worse
    Save small folk in the nursery."</p>

</div>

<p>There was much quiet confabulation between
Algernon and "Mr. Johnson," but I
took no notice of them, and amused myself
in my own way. Most of the evening I
spent with my mother; and when, rather
late, I took her candle to her own apartment,
I told her I meant to marry next day&mdash;the
same day, I ought to have said, for
midnight was past. I explained to her that
the marriage was to be a profound secret,
as yet, telling her partly why. She consented
to keep the secret; I went off to find
my Lady Grace. Lady Grace Lesbury!
By Jove! it sounds uncommon well. Lady
Grace Marchmont is not bad. I was at
Five Tree Hill a great deal earlier than was
necessary that morning; but the right time

<!-- vol 3 page 222 -->

came, and I drove Grace into Redborough,
and the parson and the license were both
there.</p>

<p>How surprised she was when I told her
who she was, and that she must sign her
name Grace Lesbury! She knew that there
was something strange in the relations between
her father and mother; she knew
that the latter had endured great suffering
through her husband's treatment; she had
sometimes doubted whether her name was
really Smith. But hers was no inquisitive
temper, and she loved her mother too well
to trouble her with questions: so she was
ignorant of her real name and rank till I of
necessity had to tell her.</p>

<p>"So you see I am running away with an
Earl's daughter, Grace," I said.</p>

<p>She answered with a loving look, and
signed her new-discovered name with a hand
that did not tremble.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

<p>I drove Grace home toward Beau Sejour
in capital time for breakfast. What a jolly
drive it was! There was to be perfect
secrecy, and she was discreet. I dropped
her quietly near (not too near) Five Tree
Hill, giving her instruction what to do amid
all conceivable circumstances. She liked
the fun extremely. I was back at Romayne
Court, important as had been my business,
before the general folk down to breakfast.
Our matutinal habits, as I think has been
remarked, were always free and easy; they
are free and easy now, dear reader, as you
may see for yourself if you like to call and
investigate the subject.</p>

<p>Now, having made the winning move on
the chess-board, I could watch with considerable
amusement the politics of the other
players. It was odd that so acute a man as
my brother Algernon had left the lady quite
out of his scheme, taking for granted that she

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

would do exactly what he wished without
the slightest recalcitration: but it was one
of a thousand proofs within my own knowledge
that the men who understand finance
are not the men who understand women.
Algy had made Lord Lesbury's acquaintance,
and helped him out of some of his
difficulties, and received promise of Lady
Grace as a reward. That, I found, was the
state of affairs. The Earl's notion of marrying
Dot was of mixed origin: he saw the
child was excessive in beauty: he heard
that she would have money. The Earl's existence
had been a chronic cry for pretty
girls and more money.</p>

<p>It was rather odd that in the course of
the day my father opened again on the subject
with me. I was reading quietly in the
library when I heard his step.</p>

<p>"Studious as usual," said my reverend

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

sire, who would never open a book if he
could help it, and who was on his way to
the girls at the archery. "You ought to
grow very wise in time, Rex. When do
you think of being more practical? When do
you propose to get married?"</p>

<p>"I should like to find a wife like my mother,
sir," I (the married man) hypocritically
said.</p>

<p>"I wish you could," he answered. "As
you cannot, what do you think of doing?"</p>

<p>"I think of waiting," was my reply.
"There is no hurry in my case. It is probably
more important that Algernon should
make a good match. He understands those
things. When he has a big house close to
Hyde Park, and his wife gives parties at
which one meets Royal Highnesses, he will
be happy. That is not my idea of happiness,
but I know the world would deem me a fool."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

<p>"What is your idea of happiness?" said
my father, rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Perfect independence," I replied.
"Enough to live upon, and sufficient common
sense to despise a fool, even though he is a
lord. If I cannot have enough to live on
by inheritance I am prepared by manual
labour to earn enough to live upon. Still I
have no wish for a future of manual labour."</p>

<p>My father laughed in his pleasant easy
way.</p>

<p>"You shall have all I can give you, Rex;
but how much it will be, I can't guess, for
everybody's on strike. I like your independent
style. I have always wished I could
live a life beyond the reach of ordinary ideas&mdash;a
poetic life, I may say&mdash;but the chance has
never been given me. Now that you have
a little time to spare, you might inquire
whether a poetic life is possible."</p>

<p>"Any life," I said, "is possible to a man

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

of sound mind, under any conditions. Our
chief troubles are due to the maladies and
follies which we inherit from our forefathers.
I don't myself complain, but ninety-nine
souls out of a hundred are uncomfortably
wedged into very close quarters, because the
said souls left nothing in the way of space
for the tailors. I suppose the modern English
tailor is the acme of trading fools."</p>

<p>"Tailors are like the church," said my
father, "you must respect them, or you will
be set down as a heretic. Go to a good church
in a gentlemanly costume, and your fortune
is made. But now, Rex, tell me something
about yourself. What do you think of
doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present, sir, thank you: the
weather is too hot. Do you really mean, in
such frightful weather as this, to enter the
archery ground? The girls in green seem

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

to like it: but I have observed that heat and
cold do not affect unmarried ladies, when the
opposite sex is near."</p>

<p>"Rex, you won't be serious," said the
head of the house of Marchmont. "I've a
great offer for Kitty that will make her a
peeress. I want you to show her the
wisdom of accepting it."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," I said, "have you forgotten
that you accepted Perivale as a suitable
husband for Dot? They are engaged, if I
understand aright? Do you want me to have
to fight a duel with Perivale? He won't
stand any nonsense, that I know."</p>

<p>"It would be folly," rejoined my father,
"to let her marry a barrister, when she can
be Lady Lesbury to-morrow. Lord Lesbury
is perfectly willing, and he wishes that at
the same time his daughter should marry
Algernon. It will be a double family arrangement."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

<p>My father was evidently so strong in
favour of what he imagined a grand alliance
(though I never have been able to understand
the middle-class mania for pauper peers and
bankrupt barons), that he was willing to
throw our beautiful Dot into Lesbury's lap.
Lesbury was a poet: granted. Lesbury was
a patrician: granted. Lesbury was young for
his age: granted. My theory is that, for all
this, he was neither poetic nor aristocratic
nor young enough for Dot. I told my
father what I thought as mildly as I could.
He still deemed it Dot's duty not to refuse
a peer. Odd that a man of wonderful
common sense should desire to wed his only
daughter, a beautiful and accomplished girl,
to a worn-out old nobleman.</p>

<p>This sort of thing proves that the aristocratic
idea has not yet reached the dense
depths of the common English intellect.
Ah, but what is the aristocratic idea?</p>

lime-leaves, and see his finger in the wind-driven
clouds, am not concerned to argue
with scientists who have fewer faculties than
mine. You cannot teach a blind man
colour, or a deaf man music.</p>

<p>Here is Lord Lesbury. What with
his Earldom, and his fine patrician style,
and his youth-won renown, he fascinates
everybody. He conquers my father: he
almost conquers Uncle Paul: my mother
and Dot don't quite like him. Women
have a finer instinct than men in such
matters: yet even women are sometimes
apt to blunder, and to accept a man on the
strength of his title and rent-roll, his castle

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

and family diamonds. I wouldn't have
answered for Dot if she had not previously
encountered her ugly, able Queen's Counsel.</p>

<p>As the days passed on, there were conferences
among the conspirators which I unnoticingly
noticed. Lord Lesbury had
frightened his wife, who was weakened by
ill-health, into a state of absolute subjection.
This I learnt from Grace, whom I saw
every day in the ancient cemetery by Saint
Apollonia's Chapel. We enjoyed that time,
with all its complexities. We were man
and wife, and could laugh at the plotters
who strove to put my beautiful girl in other
hands. Poor Algernon! I verified my
nickname, and was Rex this time at any
rate. Grace and I wandered where Mavis
and I had wandered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ah, how long ago!
Memory of that sweet old time blended
with present enjoyment, as the thought of

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

yesterday's saffron sunset blends with the
delight of to-day's unclouded noon: and to
me it was unutterable pleasure that Grace
would know Mavis&mdash;that I should be the
link between them.</p>

<p>Dot soon came to me, telling her troubles.
Papa had been lecturing her, she said, on
the wisdom of becoming a peeress. Countess
of Lesbury, she would have a house in
Park Lane. Countess of Lesbury, she would
be a leader of fashion in London. The
Earl's fame and the Countess's brilliant
beauty would be without parallel. This
was how they tempted Dot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but Dot was
true to her Queen's Counsel.</p>

<p>The Q.C. had been obliged to return to
London after a day or two at Romayne
Court: so I had little Kitty on my hands,
and felt those hands tolerably full. What
I could not easily decide was the best way

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

to get Dot out of danger. Lesbury pursued
her all day long, and she would come to
me almost hysterical after the interviews with
him which she could not escape without offending
my father. O how sentimental the
old fox was! I pitied Dot, but I could not
quite see the best way out of the affair. I did
not want to quarrel with my father, whose
kindness of heart was so true and thorough
that it seemed a shame to thwart him. Yet
he must be thwarted eventually. Dot must
be Mrs. Perivale, and not Lady Lesbury.</p>

<p>Lesbury went over to Five Tree Hill one
morning. I happened to know that he was
going, for I went rather late to the stables
the evening before, to look at a young
horse that seemed rather weak in the fetlock.
I was trying to get a good team for
a four-in-hand. It was a fancy of my
father's, who, however, knew nothing of

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

horses, and had not nerve to drive. I,
having driven four when George the Third
was King, rather liked the idea. I had four
chestnuts, beautifully matched, and was
afraid that this fellow, whom I had tried as
off-leader, was likely to break down.
Hence I chanced to be in the stables when
the head-groom was leaving; and his last
words had reference to a close carriage being
ready for Lord Lesbury next day at
ten, to go to Five Tree Hill. I found my
young chestnut in good form, so I told the
man in charge to have the drag ready at
the stables at the same hour. I thought I
would have a little fun. I saw Dot that
evening: she was in white muslin, and
looked exquisite: she had just been singing
for my father, who loved her clear contralto
voice, a favourite song. The echo was
in the air as I entered the room, where my

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

mother was lounging in an easy-chair, while
Lesbury, an ancient beau, turned over
Kitty's music. The words were something
like this:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"July becomes December,
    And fever turns to fret;
I wish I could remember,
    Or else I could forget.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Who was the little fairy
    I madly used to woo?
Her name perhaps was Mary:
    Her eyes perhaps were blue.</p>

<p class="stanza">"No more my hot heart kindles
    At the sweet darling's name:
Love's mighty sunlight dwindles
    Into a rush-light flame.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet, I found them,
    The maiden lips I kissed:
Now cruel time has drowned them
    In melancholy mist.</p>

<p class="stanza">"In this old heart's dull ember
    Some fire is lurking yet:
I wish I could remember .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    I wish I could forget."</p>

</div>

<p>This was the little half-sad half-cynical song
which Dot was finishing as I entered: I

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

write it from memory, so, if I have misquoted,
I hope for the versifier's pardon. It
seemed to me that it had a moral for
Everard, Lord Lesbury, but he did not
wince.</p>

<p>This man was playing a curious game.
He wanted to marry Dot, for reasons
already stated: he offered his daughter as a
wife for Algernon, as a bribe. But there
was a difficulty. His wife was alive: she
was not likely to live long: and he had married
her in such a way that he thought it
possible to prove the marriage a nullity.
What should he do&mdash;wait for her death or
disown her? The former course would try
his patience: the latter might make my
brother Algernon unwilling to marry Grace.
I, at this time, was slightly uncertain whether
Mrs. Smith was really Countess of Lesbury
(or "Mrs. Johnson"), though inclining to

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

believe she was: but it made no difference
to me in regard to my darling little wife.
How should it concern me whether, being
the daughter of an unscrupulous scoundrel,
she was legitimate or illegitimate?</p>

<p>I saw old Lesbury's carriage and pair
pull up at the front entry. He got in,
scowling as if he were off on some business
he did not like, and was driven away. By
my instructions, a pair of slow old horses
had been put in the carriage: and I had
great satisfaction in depicting to myself
Lord Lesbury chafing at their tardy movement.</p>

<p>When he was gone, I went down to the
stables. My team was ready. A couple of
grooms got up behind. One, little Burns, a
Scotch Irishman, was unequalled at telling
a lie, grooming a horse, and blowing a horn.
Off we went, fourteen good miles an hour,

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

and soon passed Lord Lesbury. At the
gate of Beau Sejour I descended.</p>

<p>Grace was on the lawn, in a garden hat,
culling flowers with garden scissors, looking
as Eve would have looked in Paradise if
petticoats had been invented. She ran to
me, my sweet maiden wife, with a happy
smile. I said,</p>

<p>"Darling, how is Mamma?"</p>

<p>"Fancy," she replied, "Mamma is gone
to London! Her lawyer came down to
see her the day before yesterday&mdash;such a
nice old gentleman! Papa is very wicked:
he has been trying to prove they were never
married. But the lawyer has found out
something that made Mamma quite cheer up
again. So she went to London to see the
clergyman that married her; only think&mdash;he's
a bishop now."</p>

<p>"Well, Grace," I said, "this <i>is</i> amusing!

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

Your amiable father is on his way here at
this moment. I don't know what he wants.
I suppose to frighten your mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't see him," said Grace.</p>

<p>"No, beauty&mdash;not a bit of it. Pack up
some trifles as fast as you can, and come
with me. I want to get you away from
here before Lord Lesbury arrives."</p>

<p>Off she tripped. What a sweet innocent
thing! What a flower of merry maidenhood!
Faith, I have had my experiences:
and nothing do I know more beautiful than
a boy before he fancies himself a man&mdash;a
girl before she fancies herself a woman.
This little wife of mine was only a girl. She
will be a richer riper rarer creature when
she is a woman: but now that she is only
a rose-bud (a white rose-bud, red at the
core) O, how sweet she is!</p>

<p>Soon she returned. I found no difficulty

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

in lifting so light a creature to the box-seat
by my side. Away went the team at no end
of a pace; and we passed Lesbury a mile
from Five Tree Hill; and we drove merrily
up to the front of Romayne Court, Burns
blowing his horn with Hiberavian energy.</p>

<p>My father had gone to Redborough to
the petty sessions. My mother, they told
me, was in Kitty's hexagonal room; giving
the child a lecture, I assumed. What was
their colloquy about, I wondered. That my
mother did not like Lesbury, and did like
Perivale, I knew full well.</p>

<p>"Come, Grace," I said, and led her up the
stately stair, and along a wide corridor which
led her to Dot's turret room. Now I wish I
could describe Grace as at this moment she
seemed. The sweet strong living love in her
was like the light in a lamp; her eyes brightened
with it, her face flushed with it, her hands

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

trembled with it, her heart beat with it. As
we passed along that corridor, her wonderful
eyes looked into mine with a passion of
power: they seemed to say&mdash;<i>Love!</i> Love!
Yes: it was then I fully learnt that love is
pleasure and power, that love is virtue and
vigour, that love is the singer's sweetness
and the soldier's strength. Grace has eyes
that talk, and their talk is music and wisdom.
My mother and Dot were talking in
the window marked A B in the diagram.
Both rose from the window-seat as we entered.</p>

<p>"Your wife?" said my mother. "My
dear child! Dot, here is a sister for you."</p>

<p>Poor dear Dot was taken by surprise.
Ah, but to see Mavis Marchmont, mother of
mine, looking into the eyes of Grace, questioning
her wordlessly, trying to find out
whether she was really good enough (being

<!-- vol 3 page 244 -->

indeed a world too good) for this scapegrace
son of hers.</p>

<p>It often puzzles me that both my father
and mother like me better than Algy,
though he is so decided a success and I am
so decided a failure. I try to account for
my mother's preference because she was my
pupil: but my father perfectly perplexes me.</p>

<p>Dot and Grace soon got as playful as a
couple of fawns. There was tea for the
probably exhausted Grace&mdash;orange-pekoe in
dainty Du Barry china. My mater, knowing
all about it, petted her intensely.</p>

<p>I got into her neighbourhood and emitted
a whisper while Dot and Grace were laughing
over their dainty refreshment.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said I, "I want Grace to stay
here to-night. She is my wife, you know.
I want to show her, as my wife, to my father
and Lesbury."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

<p>Mavis, <i>mater mea</i>, ordered the choicest
suite of rooms to be ready. I took Grace
to them. I caught her in my arms. What,
think you, she said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"O Rex!"</p>

<p>And then I had to warn her that at dinner
she would have to meet not only my
father, but her own.</p>

<p>"I shall be quite brave with you, Rex,"
she said.</p>

<p>And she fulfilled her promise.</p>

</div>

<p>DISCOMFITED returned Lord Lesbury.
Tired returned my father, having
helped to adjudicate in two cases of unlawfully
cutting furze, and three of bastardy.
Neither looked quite happy when they entered
the withdrawing room before dinner. I
was there; not in a dress coat, which I have
always hated, but in a black velvet slouch,

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

and a general Bohemian touch. But Grace
made up for short-comings of mine. Mavis
and Dot had perfectly idealized her. Dear
Mamma was an artist herein, and made
Grace twenty times as pretty as she was&mdash;which
indeed was not at all necessary.
What coral blossoms in her soft brown hair!
What pure round pearls upon her pure
young neck! You should have seen Lesbury
glare at his daughter when he found
out who she was.</p>

<p>I suppose it was hardly fair to my father,
but I had made up my mind to carry out my
design with a high hand, and I knew very
well that he would ultimately think I had
done wisely. As he entered the room I
went forward to meet him with Grace on my
arm.</p>

<p>"This is my wife, sir," I said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Lady
Grace Marchmont. I was obliged to marry

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

without consulting you, but I think you will
find her a dutiful daughter."</p>

<p>My father, though taken by surprise, was
equal to the occasion. It did not occur to
him that Grace was the lady whom he had
designed for Algernon. There was no opportunity
for any explanation between him
and Lord Lesbury. The Earl glared; but
my father simply said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I commend your choice, Rex."</p>

<p>Then he took Grace's hands in his, and
looked at her for half a minute, and kissed
her on the forehead.</p>

<p>"I hope Rex is good enough for you," he
said.</p>

<p>My father has his faults: who has not?
Great faults can only accompany great
powers. My father has neither one nor the
other, but he has courage and kindness and
self-reliance in perfection. He is incapable

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

of being afraid of a man or out of temper
with a woman. When he saw Grace he fell
in love with her at once, and he never after
altered his mind.</p>

<p>My uncle entered the room at this moment,
and I went through an introduction
with him also.</p>

<p>"Well, Rex," he said, "you are fortunate,
and deserve your fortune. Does he not,
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said my father. "I have
not asked any questions yet. We will hear
the romance after dinner."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there is any romance,
sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Quite sure. Rex, you rascal, if there
isn't a romance I'll disinherit you."</p>

<p>We were forgetting the Earl all this time.
He thought we were in a conspiracy against
him&mdash;that this was premeditated insult.

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

While we were all talking, and every eye
was fixed on my beautiful Grace, this morose
old nobleman had gradually edged toward
the door. Anger and shame blended in his
humour. He could not remain in his
daughter's presence. Unobserved he left
the room, meeting, as I afterwards heard,
Algernon at the door. They hurried away
together, and Lord Lesbury made up his
mind to leave the house at once.</p>

<p>Just at this moment came the announcement
that dinner was served. My father,
though surprised at the absence of the Earl
and my brother, would not wait for them:
so we sat down to our soup, and soon warmed
into a merry party. In honour of my
wife the choicest champagne in the cellar
flowed freely. It was as joyous a party as
I remember.</p>

<p>When we came to the dessert, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

servants had left us, my father said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Now for your romance, Rex; but first,
why have Lesbury and Algy deserted us?
I can see it has something to do with your
adventure."</p>

<p>"My wife was Lady Grace Lesbury, sir,"
I said.</p>

<p>My father laughed immoderately, and we
all caught the contagion.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Rex, you've stolen a march on
us all! Why didn't you tell me? We might
have had a grand wedding."</p>

<p>"I don't care about grand weddings," was
my reply. "Give Dot as grand a one as
you please when she marries Perivale."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought she was to be Countess
of Lesbury," quoth uncle Paul.</p>

<p>"The objection to that," I said, "is that
there is a Countess of Lesbury already, and
a very charming lady she is."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 252 -->

<p>My father, a quiet and even-tempered
man amid common circumstances, was apt to
get very fierce when he deemed himself insulted.
His face assumed a sterner look
than ever I remember: he said to my uncle,</p>

<p>"Paul, find out for me what has become
of the Earl."</p>

<p>My uncle went, and we for a while were
silent. Kitty looked very much relieved, and
gave me a grateful smile. My mother seemed
amazed&mdash;an appreciative spectator of a
curious little comedy. There are people who
can regard the current of life as if they were
sitting in the stalls of a theatre, opera-glass in
hand, a white satin bill of the play before
them, a pleasant wit-lightened supper ready
when the curtain falls. Such folk not only
enjoy existence themselves, but amazingly
enhance the enjoyment of others. The
simplest thing delights them&mdash;the flight of a

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

swallow, the phases of a sunset, the ripple of
a stream. You cannot help seeing with their
eyes. They drop indolent epigrams as the
princess in some fairy tale dropped diamonds
whenever she spoke.</p>

<p>Presently my uncle returned, and with
him Algernon. My brother looked a little
puzzled and a little frightened.</p>

<p>"I have been seeing Lord Lesbury off,
sir," he said to my father. "He insisted
on going."</p>

<p>"Did he leave no message?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>My father turned to my wife and said,</p>

<p>"I will not say a word against the Earl
in his daughter's presence. Now that he is
gone, let us enjoy ourselves, and forget any
trifling annoyance. Come, Algernon, let
me introduce you to your brother's wife,
Lady Grace Marchmont. I had no idea

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

you were to be rivals. Rex is no laggard
in love, you see."</p>

<p>"I never got a chance," quoth my brother,
laughing&mdash;for my father's good-humour
was resistless. "I have lost my bride, and
I have lost my dinner."</p>

<p>"Have something devilled," was the
reply, "and drink some Burgundy with it,
and you will soon forget your losses."</p>

<p>"I think," said my mother, "that, as this
is Rex's bridal night, we ought to let the
servants have a dance in the hall. That is
an easy entertainment."</p>

<p>"Admirable notion, Mavis!" said my
father. "We'll take a stroll in the moonlight
while they get ready, and Algy eats
his disconsolate devil. Come, Grace, wrap
yourself up: I want to talk to you. You
will tell me the romance more eloquently
than Rex."</p>

<p>"What would Sir Roger de Coverley be without his
follies and his charming little brain-cracks?"</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>WE went out upon the pleasant terrace&mdash;not
my mother, who was rather
afraid of evening air, but my father and
Grace, uncle Paul and I. The lights of
Redborough lay in the valley beneath us,
faint in comparison with the lights of heaven
above. A crescent moon, thin and bright,
lay low in the west; the milky way was
clear; Mars burnt red near the zenith. I
thought of the day when I had seen the

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

light of Earth from the Peak of Power, and
fell into so deep a reverie that I hardly
knew my uncle Paul was talking to me as
we stood by the parapet. He recalled me
to myself by a laugh, and said,</p>

<p>"Why, Rex, you haven't been listening a
bit. Are you star-gazing or wool-gathering?</p>

<p>"Both, I suppose. I wish I could read
the stars. But really I beg your pardon.
What were you saying all the time?"</p>

<p>"O, I was only asking questions you did
not answer, and making suppositions you
did not contradict. What in the world
brought you into contact with your charming
bride? The whole affair seems mysterious."</p>

<p>"We are all in the groove of destiny," I
replied. "If we could analyse the relations
which exist between past and future&mdash;between

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

one individual and the rest of the
race&mdash;we should cease to be surprised at
what we call strange chances and singular
coincidences. If I dared tell you my own
actual experience, you would either think
me mad, or entirely reconsider your philosophy.</p>

<p>"Some day, perhaps. Just now I need
only relate the very simple series of incidents
which my father styles my romance.
I met Grace by what we call accident, living
incognito with her mother. I loved her
without knowing who she was. I married
her promptly, because I saw there was a plot
to give her to Algernon, and had no wish
for a long and tiresome contest. Her mother,
Countess of Lesbury, knows nothing
of it yet; she is in London on legal business,
trying to foil the schemes of her rascally
husband. To-morrow she returns; and I

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

must go over and make my peace with
her."</p>

<p>"What is she like?"</p>

<p>"She is simple and quiet; what most
struck me in her was her being so absolute
a lady. You see, she has been a confirmed
invalid&mdash;from trouble, I suspect, more than
anything; and now that she is in a fair way,
as I hear, to foil Lesbury's schemes, I predict
that she will grow young and lively
again."</p>

<p>"Where is she living?"</p>

<p>"At a place called Beau Sejour, on Five
Tree Hill&mdash;a quaint irregular cottage."</p>

<p>"Why," said my uncle, "I fancy it must
be your father's property. I know it did
belong to the Romayne estate. There's a
curious story about it that I heard one day
from an old fellow at the Romayne Arms,
when I was riding that way, and I was

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

driven in by a sharp shower. Strangely
enough, both the Lesbury family and your
mother are connected with it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"There was a curious recluse living there
for many years, who had been a very fast
man in town in George III.'s time. He was
a baronet&mdash;Sir Edward Ellesmere. He died
there, and during his last illness was nursed
by Lady Lesbury, your wife's grandmother
of course. She was then a widow, and the
rumour was that they had been lovers in
youth. Any way, the end was romantic
enough; he died, and she was found dead by
his bedside, holding his hand. The story
seemed so strange that I wrote to <i>Notes and
Queries</i> about it, and got some imperfect
verification. Is it not curious that Lady
Lesbury should live where the last Lady
Lesbury came to die?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

<p>"Very: but what were you saying about
my mother?"</p>

<p>"Why, the oddest thing is that she also
lived at Five Tree Hill when she was a
girl, and that this whimsical old baronet had
a great fancy for her. and used to teach her
out-of-the-way things, some of which she
has taught you, I believe. He left her
some property&mdash;I don't exactly know what:
your father never talks about such things.
You must acknowledge it is a curious circle
of coincidence."</p>

<p>"We'll talk it over some other time, my
dear uncle," I said. "I knew all this before,
but I wanted to hear your version of it.
Come, the moon has gone down, and there
is a cloud over Mars, and the milky way is
losing its cream, and the fiddles are playing
madly in the hall. Let us make my father
and Grace go in, else she will be having a

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

cold, and an influenza honeymoon would be
no joke."</p>

<p>"You are full of brain-cracks as a cheese
of mites," quoth uncle Paul.</p>

<p>The rising tide of music had also magnetised
my father and my wife.</p>

<p>"You are a lucky fellow, Rex," said my
father, as we passed on together. "You've
got the most charming wife in the world,
except your mother."</p>

<p>"Bracket them equal," whispered my
uncle. It was very much from the lips of
him who had for long years loyally and
purely worshipped Mavis Marchmont.</p>

<p>The hall was lighted brilliantly. Servants
and near-dwelling tenants (of whom there
were many in the Redborough suburb),
made quite a crowded party. There was an
uproar of cheering when we entered upon a
dais which is connected by swinging doors

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

with the private apartments. My father,
leading Grace to the front, said a few clear
words (he always talks like a trumpet when
addressing a number): and there were
cheers, and dancing began.</p>

<p>My father and I led out Grace and my
mother. We began with a quadrille. I think;
but I don't know, for dancing is that one of
the fine arts whose simplest elements perplex
me. I like a reel or a country dance,
and was glad when, in the small hours, the
time came to romp through Sir Roger de
Coverley.</p>

<p>During that first dance, amid the din of
music and laughter, I managed to say to my
mother that uncle Paul had just been telling
me about Five Tree Hill, and Sir
Edward, and her knowing him, and the
curious "coincidence." As I told her, I
could see in her eyes the youthful lustre

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

I so well remembered when she was a gay
girl by Saint Apollonia's Chapel. She
looked a child again. I could not help
wondering whether, even on this planet, a
process could be discovered for renewing
youth, or, at least, retarding age. Persons
to whom I have mentioned this theory have
said to me they would rather not. I hold
that men who do not wish to live long are
not worthy to live at all. We have been
told that youth is a blunder, manhood a
struggle, old age a regret. Pshaw! Youth
is a lyric, manhood an epic, age a philosophy.
Youth is prophecy, manhood fruition,
age is vision of both past and future.
If all men had my experience&mdash;which they
may if they will&mdash;youth and age would be
identical. I write this in early manhood,
with a thousand things to do in the present
which occupy me wholly, and sever me,

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

save at rare intervals, from the past and
future: but, when I was a baby in the
cradle, I had time to ponder the past, and
when I am half a century older I shall be
at leisure to consider the future.</p>

<p>"Ah," said my mother amid the merry
noise, "I wish you could have known Sir
Edward. I often think you are very like
him."</p>

<p>To describe the merriment of the evening
is beyond my power. I had planned a
stratagem at the last, and arranged it with
Mavis and Grace. It was not our wish to
take any final leave of the company, or to
have old shoes thrown after us for luck, or
to go through the ceremony (not yet obsolete,
though obsolescent, in outlying regions)
of untying the bride's garters. At the same
time I did not wish to be conspicuous by
my absence before the end came. Grace

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

and I waited for Sir Roger de Coverley,
and led it off together gaily, and then vanished
through a side-door and reached our
own suite of rooms.</p>

<p>"Tired, Regina?" I said, when we reached
a softly-lighted boudoir, and she sank on
a sofa.</p>

<p>"A little," she answered. "Is it late?
It must be."</p>

<p>It was early&mdash;five o'clock.</p>

<p>"Now, darling Grace," I said, "you must
go quietly to bed, and as fast as possible.
Those dear eyes have burnt so brightly all
night that they will lose their radiance if
you don't give them sleep. There's no
waiting-maid for you; they are all dancing
and drinking punch, and eating cold
chicken."</p>

<p>She was in bed in two minutes, and fast
asleep in five. As I sat by her side with

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

her hand in mine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a little roseleaf of a
hand, softer than Minerva's and warm with
love .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought of another hand that
long ago turned icy cold in mine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though
love was also there.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE COUNTESS OF LESBURY.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Sorrow, that sours the weak, matures the strong."</p>

</div>

<p>THE stag-beetle, whose vagaries dwellers
in the country are apt to notice in
July, is rather a curious creature. He
turns out on summer evenings, sprightly
and full of fun: he is found the next morning,
if no night-bird or bat has snapped him
up, with one of his handsome horns gone, or
two or three of his legs lost, and altogether
a used-up air which made a witty Irish lady
remark to me that the poor creatures wanted
brandy and soda. Pretty much in this

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

way looked the folk at Romayne Court on
the following morning. I went downstairs,
while my darling slept soundly still, and got
a bath, and dressed. Nobody was visible:
the servants were doing their matutinal
work in a languid way: the old butler, who
was just beginning to look after his glass,
looked so intensely dissipated, with his
dirty white necktie under his left ear, that I
fancy my father would have dismissed him
on the spot. Luckily Mr. Marchmont was
fast asleep, and likely to be for some hours.
His habits were not mine. He could sleep ten
hours at a time: I have always been thankful
if I could get five. I knew full well
that he was not likely to appear till mid-day.</p>

<p>So, as Grace slept on, I drank the delicious
freshness of the morning air, filled
with fragrance unutterable. Lucy loved

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

roses, Lucy, my lost love: Grace loved
roses too: so when I came to a choice
rosary, where the most delightful summer
roses were grown carefully, I picked the
rarest flowers I could find, covered with
crystals of early dew, and took them to my
little wife. On my way I was lucky enough
to catch a trim little waiting-maid, who was
almost half awake, and whom I detailed to
wait upon Grace. The country dances had
whirled most of the wits out of her empty
little brain, but I contrived to make her
understand what she was to do, and in due
time, when Grace awoke, she got her cup of
coffee, and all the other necessities of the
morning. She came tripping downstairs
presently with some of my roses in her
hair, and one sweet maiden-blush in her
bosom to match the bridal maiden-blush
upon her happy cheek.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

<p>"How do you feel, Regina?" I asked,
when we came into the garden that delicious
morning. "Have you had sleep
enough?"</p>

<p>"O quite! O too much, I think. I am
ready for anything now, dear Rex. I am
glad. I am yours, and that is enough. But
we must see Mamma to-day. She is to return
in the afternoon, you know. Don't forget,
my own."</p>

<p>"O I won't forget, my love: you shall
be taken back in good time. After lunch
will do, if they ever give us any lunch."</p>

<p>"O I am in no hurry for lunch: they
brought me some Strasbourg pie with my
tea: I couldn't eat anything more. I do
hope you have made a good breakfast."</p>

<p>"Capital," I said, though the idea had not
occurred to me&mdash;though indeed I never eat
before noon. Grace was satisfied, and we

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

wandered down an avenue of lime trees, and
talked that delicious unrecordable nonsense
which some people fancy can only be talked
once in a life-time. Ah, how absurd! If
it be true, it lasts: if it be true, it grows till
nonsense turns to poetry. My maiden-wife
and I passed through long alleys of soft
light and shade, where sunlight fretted turf
and gravel with a mosaic pattern, perpetually
thwarted by the wilful wind in the
foliage.</p>

<p>Grace sang a little song:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"We once were two: we now are one.
    O how sweet is the morning air!
The vow is made: the joy is won;
    Ay, and life shall be always fair.</p>

<p class="stanza">"For I'll love you while shines the sun;
    O how sweet is the morning air!
And you'll love me till life is done&mdash;
    So shall death when it comes be fair."</p>

</div>

<p>"I wonder where you got that whimsical
little song," I said.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

<p>"O, Mamma taught it me. Do you
like it? I do. I like the idea that death is
nothing to be afraid of."</p>

<p>"Why should it be?" I said. "Nobody
need fear it unless he is a scoundrel. We
don't know what will happen next, but surely
we may trust God."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Rex, it is a thing I have
always been thinking of. Somehow the
fancy came upon me, when I was quite a
little girl, that I should like to know what
death meant. If I had not loved all the
beauty and delight of life, I should have
done something desperate. I imagined another
world, wherein there was a freer and
happier life than here: but the green of the
grass, and the blue of the sky, and the song
of the birds, and my dear mother's kind
soft voice kept me from doing anything
foolish. Only I have not quite conquered

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

the wish, when I am on the top of a tower
or a cliff, to fling myself down. I fancy the
swift flight through the air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. another world. So, when I am in a
boat on the water, I am longing to plunge
into it, and am held back only by the feeling
that this world is too pleasant to leave."</p>

<P>"You foolish darling," I said. "I will
tell you all about it by-and-by. I know a
great deal more than you guess. You won't
want to jump off towers, or tumble into the
water till you are tired of me, will you?"</P>

<p>"Well, I think not," said Grace, with a
charming capricious look. "But hadn't we
better go back and see if anybody is up yet?
They must be waking by this time, surely."</p>

<p>So we went back through cool alleys,
over sunny lawns, till we reached the house,
and there, on the terrace, was uncle Paul.</p>

<p>"You are early," he said, with a merry

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

look, which seemed to insinuate some recondite
notion. "It is pleasant to see bridegroom
and bride among the leaves and
flowers before the dew has left the grass.
It shall be deemed a good omen, Rex."</p>

<p>"It shall," I said. "Regina and I, uncle
Paul, mean to carry out our names. We
mean to rule ourselves entirely, and others
when necessary."</p>

<p>"Begin with the first," said Paul Marchmont.
"To interfere in your own affairs is
unwise; to interfere in another man's affairs
is unwiser. The man who goes in for ruling
himself has very little to rule."</p>

<p>"Why, uncle Paul," says Grace, merrily,
"how can you be satirical, on a lovely summer
morning, to a new bridegroom and
bride? I am ashamed of you. The very
flowers were more fragrant than I ever knew
them: the trees whispered secrets to us:

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

the grass grew cooler to suit our feet. I
won't have you in a caustic mood," she continued,
with her pretty hand on his coat,
that was russet with age (he loved old
clothes for sake of ease), and she looked at
him so gaily that his cynicism vanished like
ice before the sunbeam, and he inwardly
swore allegiance to my charming Grace.</p>

<p>Romayne Court resumed its normal look
in time, and we got a kind of breakfast-luncheon,
and a deal of nonsense was talked
among us. I think my father was foremost.
His boyhood lasted: he took his son's marriage
as he had taken the Stock Exchange&mdash;as
he had taken a game of cricket in his
boyhood. Not the highest idea of life, we
may say: but while men like Charles Marchmont
can marry women like Mavis Lee, we
need fear no worsening of English folk.</p>

<p>In the golden afternoon we drove to

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

Beau Sejour&mdash;my father and Grace and I,
that is to say. We reached the dear old
cottage just in time: Mrs. Smith had not
returned, but was expected every minute.
When she did return, and found us in one
of the rooms overlooking that sloping lawn,
she was a little puzzled: but her visit to
London had brightened up her spirits, her
lawyer having told her that her case must
necessarily go all her own way. I had to
make an explanation which might have
caused her to be indignant&mdash;indeed, she
ought, one might think&mdash;but I am very
happy to say she wasn't. She simply said,</p>

<p>"You were in a great hurry; don't repent
at leisure. I have been repenting at leisure
all my life."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Lady Lesbury," I
said; "but there was no escape for me.
And as soon as I could get a chance, we
came to ask your pardon."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

<p>"Yes, Mamma; it is all quite true," said
Grace.</p>

<p>"You are a daring boy, I can see," said
Lady Lesbury to me, "and I don't quite
understand how you found out who I am."</p>

<p>"I think," said my father, "you had
better leave this wild fellow to himself.
He is my son, and I will be answerable for
him. Lady Grace is quite sufficient temptation
for anybody. Ladies like you, with
daughters almost as pretty as yourselves,
have very much to answer for."</p>

<p>It is not requisite to go farther into this
part of the history. Lady Lesbury, who
was well satisfied with what I and her
daughter had done, and who was glad to
come out of her retirement now that she
found that Lesbury had the worst of the
affair, surprised us all by the quiet soft dignity
of her manner, and the ease with which

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

she encountered this new phase of her existence.
Her lawyers had completely vanquished
Lord Lesbury, putting her in a
thoroughly comfortable position, and making
Grace an heiress: and Lady Lesbury, thus
victorious, verily renewed her youth. She
threw away her ailments, and was quite
pleased to accept Mamma's invitation, and
stay at Romayne Court while Grace and I
went on our honeymoon. Perivale and
Dot had made up their minds, but their
honeymoon time had not arrived.</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Comedy of Dreams</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE was some such conversation between
Grace and me that next night
at Romayne Court, when I held my beauty
in my arms, and talked over what we
should do next. O how selfish we were,
and how little we cared for all our dearest

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

friends! We had one idea .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ourselves.
We wanted to isolate ourselves, and get out
of the way of all the rest of the world. It
is a providential sort of thing, say the
cynical school, led by Thackeray: let the
young people tire each other out. This may
be true sometimes, but Grace and I have
been one for many a year, and have not
tired of each other yet.</p>

<p>I bought a yacht .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a tolerably fast and
very cosy schooner, the <i>Lydia</i>. I rechristened
it the <i>Grace</i>, of course. We had
quite a pleasant time when we were making
all our arrangements for this voyage: my
father and mother and uncle Paul and Lady
Lesbury came down to Southsea, and stayed
at some "mansion" or other, and we had an
immense amount of fun over the matter. I
was lucky enough to get a capital master for
the yacht: his name was Waring, and he

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

had been yachting all his life. Such men,
like all seamen of the first order, must be
gentlemen. There is no university like the
sea.</p>

<p>Imagine the world far away. We are in
the Mediterranean. Sky and sea are inconceivably
blue. We search for islands and
adventures, Grace and I, lying cosy amid
rugs innumerable, with none but marine and
canine companions&mdash;the latter being a
couple of pure white Newfoundland dogs
that I bought at Portsea of an old A.B.
turned dog-fancier, who had christened
them Jack and Jill. They were brother
and sister, a lovely pair.</p>

<p>Our life was strangely pleasant. Morning
brought us on deck to breakfast on unusual
fish and light wine, and to watch the
lovely lapse of water, the delicious curve of
shore. I think I could tell more distinctly

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

what at that time I saw, if I had not been
looking so much into Grace's eyes. For to
lie at her feet, and to look at her wondrous
eyes and sweet little mouth, while she told me
what she saw, while I saw nothing but
her, was enough for me. There was a
dream of sapphire sea, of marble city, of
emerald island, of sky angel-haunted in its
deepest blue, but Grace was my reality.
There she sat and radiated. Her sweet
strong spirit seemed visible to others&mdash;was
visible to me.</p>

<p>Yes, I told her. I wondered, times without
number, whether I should. This is a
world in which it is unsafe for a man to
communicate a new truth even to his wife.
Suppose you had the power, Mr. Brown,
of making yourself invisible, would you tell
Mrs. Brown, or would you become invisible
and leave Mrs. Brown to take the consequences?

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

When we analyse the reasons
why men marry women and women marry
men, we need not wonder at any unpleasant
results. Of course, in the present state of
ontological crassitude, people have no chance
of marrying as I married: and this true
history is written to give men that chance.</p>

<p>Yes, I told her. I thought I might,
when I looked on that fine square brow,
that soft mouth, curved like Apollo's bow,
those eyes, in which dreams were apparent&mdash;in
which light was latent. I was not
wrong.</p>

<p>O, how well I remember the day! There
was a merry breeze: we were off Elba. I
thought of the imprisoned Emperor, and
laughed at the folly of a man who aspires
to rule a world so insignificant as ours.
Grace was dreamy, enjoying life. I told
her what has already been told.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

<p>"Ah!" she said, when the story was over,
looking westward, where sunshine lay, "always
I used to wonder whether we should
love again some time. I cannot remember
whence I came&mdash;you can. Now who was
I, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, my beauty. You are
exactly like Lucy, your father's mother,
who died when I died."</p>

<p>"How strange it seems!" she said, with
a shudder&mdash;I had my arm around her waist&mdash;"how
strange! I am afraid, Rex. It is
more terrible to be told these things that
you must believe under a sky like this than
to hear some hideous ghost story just before
you are going to bed at Christmas. O tell
me you are hoaxing me, Rex!&mdash;O tell me
you are telling stories!"</p>

<p>It has been asked, gravely, what is the
chief end of woman; I say, <i>to surprise man</i>.

<!-- vol 3 page 285 -->

Why in the world should Grace be afraid
on board a schooner yacht in the Mediterranean
on the loveliest day in the world?</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you I am telling
stones, my beautiful Grace," I said, "because
I am telling absolute truth, and because
it is truth on an important subject.
Now, Grace, you foolish pet, what is there
to frighten you in what I have told to you,
and to nobody else? I loved your grandmother
years ago: you are just like her:
you are my wife. The dear creature whom
you know as my mother was my little pet
and pupil years ago. It is hard to understand
this, Grace, my darling: but if it is all
true, why should it frighten you? I am
almost sorry I told you, but I regard my
wife as myself, and I hate having secrets
from her."</p>

<p>She was quiet and thoughtful for a time;
then she said,</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 286 -->

<p>"Rex, dear, I am very glad you told me.
It is rather puzzling to a child like me, you
know," she went on, with an enchanting
moue. "But either you are mad, or what
you say is true&mdash;and I don't think you are
mad, Rex."</p>

<p>"I think not, Grace. I am sane enough.
Only I remember what other people forget,
and I expect what other people dare not
believe. A man who has seen other countries
is astonishing to people who have lived
in the same street all their lives. I have
seen another world, and therefore I frighten
you: but you, my dear little flower&mdash;my
delicate dream of beauty&mdash;will see other
worlds too, if you have a soul."</p>

<p>Grace was equal to the occasion. Her
guitar was by her side, the most elegant instrument
a lady can touch. She took it,
and sang:</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 287 -->

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">            "<span class="smcap">If</span> I have a soul, Sir!
'Tis thus that men will sneer, and think it droll.
            Long as planets roll, Sir,
Woman will have no soul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she <i>is</i> a soul.</p>

<p class="stanza">            "Have you got a brain, Sir?
That's the keen question which I ask of you.
            Girls are very vain, Sir .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
To men the prize for vanity is due."</p>

</div>

<p>I wish I could put the time upon paper.
I wish I could sketch Grace, as she lay
amid her rugs, with Jack and Jill like two
great dogs of snow carved at her feet, as we
raced through the Midland Sea's tranquil
sapphire.</p>

<p>In the present state of Great British
modesty it is hard to put into sufficiently
decorous prose anything that bridegroom
and bride are likely to say to each other
when yachting in the Mediterranean. Although
this slightly interferes with the interest
of a novel, I, as a moral man, and a

<!-- vol 3 page 288 -->

confirmed old fogy, am very glad of it.
Those days are past when, with Grace, I
sailed the Mediterranean Sea. I am, according
to the current chronology, thirty-four.
Grace and I have only two children,
a boy and a girl, the boy the elder. Looking
at these youngsters in the light of my
unique experience, I cannot help believing
that they are old friends under a new aspect.
I study them daily. So does Grace, who
has got over her first fright, and begins to
think the whole thing delightful.</p>

<p>And it is delightful, as are all things that
are true. God meant man to be happy
and wise. Thank Him for pain, without
which pleasure cannot be truly known.
Thank Him for crime, without which we
could not know virtue. Thank Him for
hatred and darkness, since they teach us to
know <span class="smcap">Him</span>&mdash;who is <span class="smcap">Love</span> and <span class="smcap">Light</span>!</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 289 -->

<p>"Perfect light is perfect love," I said to
Grace one day, when we were talking over
my strange experience, while my son Harry
was trying to break his neck by infantile
gymnastics, and my daughter Kitty (could
I forget dear Dot, now Lady Perivale?) was
worrying her mother abominably. If we
knew everything, we could not hate anybody.
We shall not reach the absolute enjoyment
of existence till a clear light shines
through the universe."</p>

<p>"Till Mr. Cook can organise excursions
to Mars, I suppose," said Grace.</p>

<p>"You like to laugh at me, darling," I
said, "but you know full well that what I
have said is true. Between you and me
there is perfect light, and therefore perfect
love!"</p>

<p>"I wish the world could know what we
know," said Grace.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 290 -->

<p>Ah, and how I wish it also. It is four
o'clock on a July morning as I finish this
narrative. Grace is in bed. She is the only
person in the world who knows what I have
endured, who knows that I am writing of it.
As the names throughout are changed, my
father and mother will never guess, if they
should see the book: but I confess I am
slightly afraid of my uncle Paul's keen intellect.
He is almost unfairly incisive.</p>

<p>I have not done with this subject. I am
of opinion that any man who attacks the
question philosophically may secure a safe
passage from the present to the future, even
if he know nothing of the past. What I
have done others may do. I <i>know</i> the soul
to be immortal: the unfortunate people
who only <i>hope</i> that it is immortal may get
proof if they go the right way to work.
Moreover, you may, by scientific analysis,

<!-- vol 3 page 291 -->

trace the soul backward. I have two children,
Harry and Kitty. I have traced them
backward .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but as yet the investigation
is through three generations only. The
completion of the theory can be stated only
in a scientific treatise, and would be out of
place in a narrative of fact.</p>

<p>Lady Grace Marchmont is no longer
frightened by what I have had to reveal to
her. She reminds me, as I have heretofore
said, by her luminous beauty, by something
that seem to show the soul through the
flesh, by a thousand little ways, by her
power of making roses bloom, by her fanciful
sweet songs, of Lucy Lovelace.</p>

<p>It was one winter evening, when, she and
I alone together, I had been telling her
little things about Lucy, that she said,</p>

<p>"I remember. I recollect when you
broke that eggshell china cup, with the gold

<!-- vol 3 page 292 -->

dog on your riding-whip. Yes. I <i>was</i> Lucy.
I <i>am</i> Lucy. O, I shall always remember
now!"</p>
